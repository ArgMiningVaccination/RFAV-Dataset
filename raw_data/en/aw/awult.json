Introduction Increasing evidence suggests that meditation practices may impact physiological pathways, including the immune and neuroendocrine systems, which are modulated by stress andare relevant to disease development and progression ( Taylor , 1995; Carlson et al., 2003, 2007; Davidson et al., 2003; Hidderley and Holt, 2004; Ospina et al., 2007; Tang et al.,2007 ). For example, Davidson et al. reported that training in mindfulness meditation enhanced antibody production fol- lowing influenza vaccination ( Davidson et al., 2003 ), and Carlson et al. found that participants with early stage cancer who were trained in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) showed decreases in monocyte numbers as well asdecreased stimulated production of interferon-gamma andinterleukin (IL)-10, which persisted for 1 year ( Carlson et al., 2003, 2007 ). In addition, Tang et al. found that training in an ''integrative meditation'' was associated with reduced cor-tisol responses to a 3-min mental arithmetic stressor ( Tang et al., 2007 ). To date, the majority of studies examining the effects of meditation on immune and neuroendocrine parameters have focused on practices that emphasize calming the mind (e.g. transcendental meditation [TM 1]), improving focused atten- tion, (e.g. Ospina et al., 2007; Lutz et al., 2008a ). We wondered whether forms of meditation that build upon these practices by adding tech-niques designed to actively generate compassion for otherpeople might also be effective in modulating physiological stress responses. Examples of these types of compassion practices include loving-kindness ( metta ) ( Salzberg, 2002; Lutz et al., 2008a ). Although little is known regarding the effect of compassion meditation (or other compassion train- ing techniques) on stress-related behavioral and neurobio- logical responses ( Carson et al., 2005; Gilbert and Procter , 2006; Lutz et al., 2008a ), interest in compassion meditation within the research community has heightened signicantly over the last 5 years as a result of several inter-related ndings. First, while practicing compassion meditation,advanced Tibetan Buddhist practitioners appear capable of strongly inducing EEG patterns previously associated with positive emotionality and enhanced adaptive immune func-tioning ( Goleman, 2003 ). Second, a recent study suggests that even brief exposure to compassion meditation training may affect activity in stress-relevant brain areas such asanterior cingulate and amygdala ( Lutz et al., 2008b ). practices have been shown to increase self-compas- sion ( Shapiro et al., 2005, 2007 ). Self-compassion, in turn, has been associated with a variety of desirable endpoints,including reductions in perceived stress, burnout, depres- sion, and anxiety as well as increases in life satisfaction (Neff et al., 2005; Shapiro et al., 2005; Gilbert and Procter ,2006; Neff et al., 2007; Shapiro et al., 2007 ). Finally, of direct relevance to the current study, data also suggest that individuals with strong self-compassion demonstrate atte-nuated negative emotional reactions to laboratory psycho- social stressors. For example, self-compassion (but not self esteem) was associated with less anxiety in response to amock job interview and less distress after receiving neutralfeedback in response to a videotaped speech performance (Leary et al., 2007; Neff et al., 2007 ). Because laboratory psychosocial stressors have been shown to reliably activateinnate immune and et al., 2006; Steptoe et al., 2007 ), it is possible that compassion meditation training may reduce emotional responses to stress and thereby attenuate s tress-induced activation of innate immune and neuroendocrine responses. Neverthe-less, to our knowledge, no studies have examined thispossibility. Accordingly, the current study was designed as an initial investigation into the effect of lojong -based compassion meditation training on innate immune and neuroendocrine responses to psychosocial stress. More specically, we sought to test the hypothesis that training in and practice of com-passion meditation would reduce interleukin (IL)-6 and cor- tisol responses to a standardized laboratory psychosocial stressor (Trier social stress test [TSST]) in medically healthyyoung adults when compared to a health discussion control group. Testing the effect of meditation on these physiological responses is of signicant potential health relevance givenincreasing data that chronic life stress increases plasmaconcentrations of IL-6 and that even mildly increased levels of plasma IL-6 (and/or its downstream product c-reactive protein) predict the development of a number of diseasestates, including vascular disease, diabetes et 2001; Kiecolt-Glaser et al., Perry et al., 2007; Steptoe et al., 2007 ). Major depres- sion has also been repeatedly associated with increased plasma concentrations of IL-6 ( Raison et al., 2006 ). Likewise, increases in cortisol have been frequently observed in majordepression and have been posited to contribute to stress- related metabolic abnormalities and neurotoxicity ( Raison and Miller , 2003 ). Moreover, recent data indicate that cortisol responses to stress may modulate IL-6 responses and thus maycontribute to long-term effects of stress on disease devel- opment via modulatory effects on the innate immune response ( Bower et al., 2007 ). Finally, because of the paucity of studies that have exam- ined the relative engagement of research subjects in com- passion meditation techniques ( Carson et al., 2005; Lutz et al., 2008a,b ), we also sought to assess the extent of participation in the compassion meditation program (as reflected by class attendance and meditation practice) andits potential relationship with relevant immune, neuroendo-crine and behavioral outcome variables.individuals below the median, who did not differ from controls. These data suggest that engagement in compassion meditation may reduce stress-induced immune and behavioral responses, although future studies are required to determine whether individuals who engage in compassion meditationtechniques are more likely to exhibit reduced stress reactivity. #2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Subjects were betweenthe ages of 17 and 19 (mean age 18.5 years, S.D. 0.7), were medically healthy and had no history of signicant psychiatric illness (i.e. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or depressionsevere enough to warrant hospitalization) as determinedby a psychiatrist certied by the American Board of Psychia- try and Neurology. Potential participants were excluded at the beginning of the study for active psychiatric treatment(including psychotherapy/counseling) or for a score /C2130 on the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Self Report (IDS-SR), consistent with moderate to severe depression ( Rush et al., 2000 ). Participants were free of all psychotropic medications prior to study entry and were free of other medications known to influence the immune or neuroendocrine systemsfor a minimum of 2 weeks prior to the TSST . Participants were excluded from the TSST for any signs of acute infection on the day of TSST administration. All participants provided writteninformed consent, and all study procedures were a prioriapproved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board. 2.2. Overview of study procedures The study occurred during spring and fall semesters of the 2006 calendar year. Participants were stratied by sex and then randomly assigned to 6 weeks of compassion medita-tion training or a health discussion group, which served as the control condition. Between study weeks 8 through 10, subjects participated in a standardized laboratory psycho-social stressor (TSST). TSSTs occurred between 2 and 5p.m., with timing of the test balanced between males and females and between part icipants in the meditation and control groups. 2.3. Recruitment, randomization and allocation concealment All subjects were recruited from a health education class at Emory University. An overview of the study was provided at the rst class of each semester by the principal investigator , and individuals interested in participating were provided with consent forms and scheduled for a screening appoint-ment. Potential participants were informed that the pur- pose of the study was to examine health effects of meditation, and that participants randomized to the healthdiscussion group would be offe red a voluntary meditation class in the following semester. Individuals who met entry criteria following screening were stratied by sex and ran-domized. Randomization was accomplished through the useof separate computer generated randomization lists for males and females. Subjects we re sequentially assigned a place on the appropriate randomization list based on theorder in which they signed consent. Group assignment was concealed from participants and from study personnel interacting with participants until baseline data wereobtained (i.e. depressive symptom score, body mass index, and demographic information).2.4. Compassion meditation and health education discussion groups The compassion meditation program employed in this study was designed and taught by one of us (LTN). Participants randomized to meditation training attended a 50-min classtwice a week for 6 weeks. Class sessions combined teaching and discussion with an average of 20 min of meditation practice. Participants were provided with a meditation com-pact disk (CD) designed to guide ''at-home'' practice sessions that reflected material presented and practiced in class. Although secular in presentation, the compassion meditationprogram was derived from Tibetan Buddhist mind-training (Tibetan lojong ) practices. These practices derive largely from writings ascribed to the Indian Buddhist masters Shan-tideva (8th Century) and Atisha (11th Century) ( The Dalai Lama, 2001 ) and differ in important ways from the mind- fulness-based practices that have received most of the scientic attention in recent years. Whereas mindfulness-based practices emphasize the development and mainte- nance of a non-judgmental stance toward thought processes and emotional reactions ( Kabat-Zinn, 1991 ), lojong practices utilize a cognitive, analytic approach to challenge one's unexamined thoughts and emotions toward other people, with the long-term goal of developing altruistic emotions andbehavior towards all people ( The Dalai Lama, 2001 ). Lojong- based compassion meditation has two primary elements: an initial phase in which various arguments are examined that challenge one's common sense notion of other people asfalling into the categories of ''friend, enemy and stranger'' and a second phase in which one practices developing spon- taneous feelings of empathy and love for an ever expandingcircle of people, beginning with the self and extending eventually to those with whom one has conflicts and/or dislikes. Within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, concentrative(i.e. shamatha) and mindfulness (i.e. vipassana) practices are typically employed as valuable preliminary techniques for establishing the focus and awareness necessary to engagein specic compassion practices ( The Dalai Lama, 2001 ). In keeping with this tradition, in the current study subjects were given 2 weeks of training in attentional and mindful- ness-based techniques to help improve attention and aware-ness prior to commencing specic lojong compassion practices in training weeks 3\u20146. The training protocol was highly iterative, such that by the end of 6 weeks, eachstudent's daily meditation practice (guided by CD) began with a brief period of shamatha and vipassana to calm and focus the mind, followed by analytical practices designed tochallenge unexamined assumptions regarding feelings andactions toward others with a focus on generating spontaneous empathy and compassion for themselves and others. Table 1 provides a week-by-week description of the elements of thecompassion meditation protocol utilized in the current study. Participants randomized to the control condition attended health discussion groups that \u2014 like the meditation inter-vention \u2014 required 12 h of participation across the study period. During the rst study semester groups met once a week for 12 weeks, and in the second semester they mettwice a week for 6 weeks to better match the schedule of the meditation classes. Classes were taught by graduate students under the supervision of one of us (DDA). The content ofgroups in both semesters was identical and was designed byEffect of Compassion Meditation on Responses to Psychosocial Stress 89study investigators (DDA and TDB). Topics relevant to the mental and physical health of college students that were discussed included stress management, the physician'sexam, environmental health, substance abuse, depression and anxiety, body image and eating disorders, sexual assault, contraception, sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS.In addition to didactic content delivered by the instructor , avariety of techniques were employed to enhance subject participation, including community building exercises, group discussion, mock debates and role playing. To provide some''at-home'' activity to match the expectation that partici- pants in the compassion meditation group would practice meditation on a daily basis, participants in the control groupcompleted a weekly 2\u20143 page self-improvement paper focused on the health topic discussed that week in class. For both meditation and control groups, participation in the study was assessed as the number of classes attended. Forthe meditation group, time spent practicing meditation out- side of class was also recorded within 48 h of its occurrence using a secure, internet-based meditation diary. To evaluatelevel of engagement with the meditation practice, the mean number of meditation sessions engaged in per week during the study was calculated by adding all at-home sessions thatexceeded 10 min in length to the total number of meditation sessions attended during class time. We chose average num- ber of sessions (class + at-home) per week as the primarymetric for engagement with the program rather than number of minutes spent practicing meditation based on recent data indicating that number of sessions is a stronger predictor thannumber of minutes for health-relevant behavioral outcomes(Pradhan et al., 2007 ). 2.5. Trier social stress test (TSST) The TSST is a standardized laboratory psychosocial stress test that reliably activates the hypothalamic\u2014pituitary\u2014adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system ( Kirschbaum et al., 1993; Dickerson and Kemeny, 2004 ). More recently, the TSST has also been shown to activate inflammatory signaling pathways ( Bierhaus et al., 2003; Pace et al., 2006 ) and to stimulate proinflammatory cytokine production in healthy adults ( Steptoe et al., 2001; Pace et al., 2006 ). Inthe current study, participants arrived at the Emory Univer- sity Hospital General Clinical Research Center 90 min prior to the TSST stressor (public speaking followed by mental arith-metic) to allow for acclimatization after placement of an indwelling venous catheter. Plasma cortisol concentrations were assessed prior to initiation of the public speakingstressor (T0) and 15 min (T1), 30 min (T2), 45 min (T3),60 min (T4), 75 min (T5) and 90 min (T6) after stressor initiation. Based on ndings from a previous study by our group demonstrating a time-lag in IL-6 responses ( Pace et al., 2006 ), plasma IL-6 concentrations were assessed at T0 and then 30 min (T2), 60 min (T4), 75 min (T5) and 90 min (T6) post-stressor. Plasma concentrations of IL-6 were selected asthe measure of innate immune response to the TSST based on several factors. A recent meta-analysis has identied plasma IL-6 as among the most reliable measures of the innateimmune response to laboratory stressors such as the TSST(Steptoe et al., 2007 ). Consistent with this, our group has reliably measured increases in this cytokine in response to the TSST in separate populations and has shown that medi-cally healthy men with depression have increased IL-6 responses to the TSSTwhen compared to men without depres- sion ( Pace et al., 2006 ). Finally, signicant data demonstrate that naturalistic life stress increases IL-6 and that elevated plasma levels of IL-6 are a risk factor for the development and/or progression of a number of disease states ( Ridker Perry et al., 2007; Steptoe et al., 2007 ). Our selection of cortisol as an index of neuroendocrine activation is consistent with thevast majority of TSST-based studies that have likewise usedcortisol for this purpose ( Dickerson and Kemeny, 2004 ). More- over , as the end product of HPA axis activation and a primary physiological restraint upon immune activity, cortisol is espe-cially relevant in terms of stress physiology and health (Raison and Miller , 2003 ). 2.6. Assessment of physiological measures During the TSST , blood (7 ml) was collected into chilled EDTA- coated monovettes and centrifuged immediately. Plasma wasstored at /C0808C were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)Table 1 Elements and schedule of compassion meditation training program Week 1: Developing basic concentration and mental stability. Participants taught basic attentional meditation practice (i.e. shamatha) by using the breath as the object of focusWeek 2: Introduction of mindfulness (i.e. vipassana) practice. Participants instructed in the techniques of non-judgmentalobservation of the processes of thought and bodily sensation Week 3: Use of concentrative and mindfulness techniques to explore universal human desires for happiness and wishes to avoid suffering as a prelude toward the practice of developing compassion for the selfWeek 4: Continuing meditation on the thought that the self shares with all people a desire for happiness and a wish to avoid suffering, as well as a struggle to attain these goals. Participants instructed to expand upon this awareness to examine the contingent and changeable nature of the distinctions between ''friends'' and ''enemies'', with the goal of generating a felt sensethat instinctive emotional responses to others do not reflect reality Week 5: Meditative reflection on the disadvantages of selshness and a self-centered attitude and the advantages of considering the welfare of others. Participants guided through meditative techniques aimed at generating compassionate emotions and cognitionsfor those emotionally close to them Week 6: Meditation aimed at attempting to generate compassionate emotions not only for friends, but also for strangers and people participants do not like.

For the cortisol radioimmunoassay, coefcients of variation were 7 and 6%, respectively. 2.7. Assessment of behavioral symptoms The 30-item Prole of Mood States (POMS) was used toevaluate general distress levels prior to, and immediatelyfollowing, the TSST ( McNair et al., 1992 ). Following standard procedure, general distress was calculated by summing scores on the tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, fatigue-inertia, and scales and subtracting scores on the vigor-activity subscale. Presence and severity of depressive symptoms was assessedat the start of the study (prior to randomization) with the IDS- SR, a 30-item self report questionnaire that demonstrates good concurrent validity with clinician-administered depres-sion scales ( Rush et al., 2000; Byrom et al., 2005 ). 2.8. Statistical analysis Demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample were compared using t-tests for continuous variables and Chi- square for categorical variables. t-Tests were also used to examine differences between groups in baseline (i.e. pre- TSST) levels of cortisol, IL-6 and POMS distress scores. Toevaluate differences between groups in the absolute values of each variable across the entire TSST procedure (i.e. from baseline to 90 min post-stressor), two-way analysis of var-iance (ANOVA) for mixed measures was used, with Huynh\u2014 Feldt adjustments for unequal variance employed when indicated. To more specically assess changes in each vari-able in response to the TSST , analyses were repeated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) that adjusted for the base- line value of Because cortisol 2005 ), we also included time of stressor initiation as a covariate in all analyses of these variables. Where indicated, post hoc comparisons of specic means of interest wereconducted using the Bonferroni test. IL-6 and cortisol responses to the TSST (baseline to 90 min after the start of the stressor) were also evaluated according to an areaunder the curve (AUC) methodology. Recent data demon- strate that different, and equally relevant, patterns of nd- ings are obtained depending on whether AUC is calculated asthe area from the initial value (AUC i) or from the ground \u2014 or zero \u2014 value (AUC g) for the variable of interest ( Pruessner et al., 2003 ). In the current study we computed both AUC metrics using the trapezoidal formula to evaluate the effectof compassion meditation on IL-6 and cortisol responses to between control andcompassion meditation groups using t-tests. Because log transformed IL-6 concentrations were not amendable to an AUCgapproach, non-log transformed values of IL-6 were used to compute this measure of AUC. For all other analyses, IL-6 concentrations were log transformed to improve normality. To evaluate relationships between meditation practice andresponses to the TSST (restricted to the meditation group),Pearson partial moment correlations were employed control- ling for time of TSST administration. Correlations were per-formed with and without adjustment for baseline (i.e. pre-stressor) values of each variable to examine associations of practice time with both absolute post-stressor values as well as with amount of reactivity for each variable. For theseanalyses, meditation practice time was considered to be the mean number of practice sessions per week, and maximal TSST IL-6 and cortisol responses were considered to be the IL-6 and cortisol values at 90 and 30 min, respectively (corre- sponding to the maximal responses in these variables in the sample as a whole- \u2014see below). Mean post-TSST gvalues and cortisol were also in these correlational analyses. Tests of signicance were two-sided with an alpha level set atp<0.05. All analyses were performed using SPSS 13 for Macintosh. ANOVAs were run with SPSS GLM Univariate. 3. Results The study flowchart (based on the consolidated standards ofreporting trials [CONSORT] recommendations) is provided inFig. 1 . Ninety-three individuals signed consent and were screened for study participation. Eighty-nine of these indi- viduals (39 males/50 females) met entry criteria and wererandomized to either compassion meditation ( n= 45) or the health discussion control group ( n= 44). T wenty-eight parti- cipants withdrew from the study after randomization but prior to completing the TSST (12 from the meditation groupand 16 from the control group). Sixty-one participants com- pleted the study (meditation n= 33; control n= 28). Primary reasons for withdrawal included scheduling conflicts, desireto discontinue meditation training or being disqualied from (i.e. due to illness) or unwilling/unable to participate in the TSST . Participants who withdrew did not differ from thosewho completed the study in terms age, sex, BMI or baseline IDS-SR depressive symptom scores (data not shown). As shown in Table 2 , no differences were found between participants randomized to the meditation or control groupsin terms of age, sex, BMI, or IDS-SR scores. Class attendance was approximately 90% in both groups; however , participants randomized to moreclasses (11.46 [S.D. = 0.88; range 8\u201412 to meditation ( 1 Within the meditation group, the average number of ''at-home'' practice sessions per week was 2.81 (S.D. = 1.65; range 0.55\u20147.01 sessions) and the mean numberof total practice sessions per week during the study (clas-s + at-home) was 3.64 (S.D. = 1.65; range 1.34\u20147.87 sessions) (Table 1 andFig. 2 ). The average time spent meditating per session outside of class was 20.08 min (S.D. 4.54; range 11\u201429 min). No signicant correlations were found between any demographic or clinical variables (i.e. age, sex, BMI, IDS-SR score) and total number of practice sessions in the medita-tion group (data not shown).

Similar results were obtained when practice time was con- sidered as minutes spent practicing during the study ratherthan number of practice sessions (data not shown). No correlation was observed between meditation practice and in the health discussion controlgroup was not associated with any TSST outcome variables. Because we found no main effect of group assignment (meditation vs. control) for IL-6 or POMS responses to theTSST , we wondered whether correlations between these variables and amount of meditation practice reflected the fact that participants who practiced more had reductions inthese variables or that inability/unwillingness to practice at- home identied individuals with increased IL-6 and distress responses to the TSSTwhen compared to controls. To conductan exploratory analysis of this question, we divided partici- pants randomized to compassion meditation training into high practice and low practice groups based on a mediansplit of mean number of practice sessions per week andcompared maximal post-TSST plasma concentrations,IL-6 responses expressed as AUC post-TSST POMS scores between high practice meditation ( n= 17), low practice meditation ( n= 16) and control groups ( n= 28). At the start of the study, participants in high and low practice groups did not differ from each other or from controls in age ( F[2, 58] = 0.27, p= 0.767). Similarly, groups did not differ in baseline (i.e. pre-TSST stressor) plasma concentrations reduced POMS distress scores just prior tothe TSST stressor when compared to both the low practice Figure 3 The Trier social stress test (TSST) increased plasma concentrations of cortisol, interleukin (IL)-6, as well as Prole of Mood States (POMS) emotional distress scores in the study sample as a whole (a\u2014c).

Post hoc analyses indicated that participants in the high practice group had signicantlyreduced maximal TSST-induced IL-6 responses as well as reduced TSST-induced IL-6 responses expressed as AUC g when compared to participants in the low practice group.Neither practice group differed in either maximal or AUC gIL- 6 responses from control participants, whose values were intermediate between the high and low practice meditationgroups ( Fig. 6 ).

Summary of study ndings The current study adds to a growing literature on the poten- tial impact of meditation on physiologic parameters relevant to health, including immune and neuroendocrine responsesto stress.

For Prole of Mood States (POMS) emotional distressresponses to the TSST , no differences were found between the low practice meditation group and either the high practice or control groups. The high practice group demonstrated a trend(p= 0.07) toward reduced emotional distress following the TSST when compared to the control group (b). Figure 5 In participants randomized to compassion meditation training ( n= 33), the mean number of meditation practice ses- sions engaged in per week (in class + at-home) during the study was inversely correlated with Prole of Mood States (POMS)emotional distress scores immediately after completion of the Trier social stress test (TSST) public speaking/mental arithmetic stressor ( r p=/C0.42, an inverse correlation between post-stressor POMS distress scores and amount of med- itation practice was observed when baseline POMS scores were as a covariate ( rp=/C00.3\u20141, p= T .W.W. Pace et al.training on innate immune, HPA axis or behavioral responses to a laboratory psychosocial stressor was found, within thegroup of participants randomized to training, weobserved signicant correlations between amount of medita- tion practice and innate immune and behavioral responses to psychosocial stress. No correlation was observed betweenamount of practice and cortisol responses to the TSST . In the absence of a main effect of group assignment, it is not possible to conclusively establish that correlationsbetween amount of meditation practice and IL-6/POMS responses to the TSSTreflect an association between practice time and reductions in these immune and behavioral vari-ables. While it is certainly plausible that practicing compas- sion meditation might reduce innate immune and distress responses to stress, it is also possible that an unwillingness orinability to practice meditation might be associated with atendency toward increased innate immune and emotional responses to psychosocial stress. To address this issue, exploratory analyses were conducted by examining highand low meditation practice groups (as determined by a median split in mean number of weekly practice sessions) and comparing these groups to control participants in termsof IL-6 and POMS responses to the TSST . These analyses indicated that the association between practice time and immune and behavioral outcomes was not accounted for bythe fact that participants who practiced less had increasedresponses to the TSST when compared to controls. Rather, their responses were no different than controls and were signicantly higher than those of participants above themedian in practice time. 4.2. Study implications Several explanations for our ndings warrant consideration.The lack of a main effect of group raises the possibility that compassion meditation training may have limited impact on health-relevant physiological or behavioral responses to psy-chosocial stress. Alternatively, however , it may be that the effect of compassion meditation on stress responses is dose dependent and only apparent in individuals who commit tosome minimum amount of practice time. In this regard, it isnotable that participants in the current study demonstrated a wide range of willingness/ability to engage in meditation practice outside of the scheduled training classes. Most of ourparticipants practiced less than the recommendation of one session per day, and less than has been reported in some (Carlson et al., 2003; Carmody and Baer , 2007; Pradhan et al., 2007 ), but not all ( Davidson et al., 2003; Shapiro et al., 2005; Carlson et al., 2007 ), recent studies examining the effect of meditation on health-relevant variables, in which amounts ofat-home practice have ranged from 2.1 sessions per week (average of 31.2 min practice time per week) ( Davidson et al., 2003 ) to 6 sessions per week (average of 360 min practice time per week) ( Pradhan et al., 2007 ). The nding of an association between amount of practice and outcomes in the current study must be placed within the context of a literature on relationships between meditationpractice time and outcomes that is contradictory. For exam- ple, in very advanced practitioners Lutz et al. reported an association between total lifetime hours of practice and EEGndings prior to, and while engaged in, a session of non- referential compassion meditation ( Lutz et al., 2004 ), andseveral studies indicate an association between practice time during MBSR and decreased psychological distress ( Carmody and Baer , 2007; Pradhan et al., 2007 ). On the other hand, practice time during MBSR was not associated with improved antibody responses to an influenza vaccine in healthy sub- jects ( Davidson et al., 2003 ) or with a variety of immune, neuroendocrine or behavioral parameters in patients with cancer ( Carlson et al., 2003, 2004 ) or with depressive symp- toms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( Sephton et al., 2007 ). Interestingly, several recent studies that found an association between practice time and outcome failed to show an effect of group assignment (i.e. the group rando-mized to meditation did not separate from that control condition) ( Shapiro et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2007 ), whereas several recent studies reporting a signicant effectof group assignment found no relationship between amountof engagement with the practice and outcomes ( Davidson et al., 2003; Sephton et al., 2007 ). Similarly, associations between practice time and outcome do not seem signicantlymore likely to occur in studies with high amounts of practice time than in studies with signicantly lower levels of subject participation. Given the fact that the compassion meditation program used in the current study built sequentially from attention training through increasingly difcult, emotionally challen-ging, mental exercises (i.e. attempting to induce positiveemotions towards individuals one dislikes), it may be that the training was more vulnerable to practice time effects than other meditation techniques. In this scenario, participantswho were more engaged in the process may have been more likely to have been exposed to the downstream emphasis on training in compassion which occurred in later sessions andthat might have been disproportionately associated with responses to the TSST . Interestingly in this regard, an asso- ciation between practice time and physiological, behavioralor neural outcomes has been observed in the three prior published studies that have examined compassion-based meditation practices ( Lutz et al., 2004, 2008b; Carson et al., 2005 ). The current study adds to an emerging database suggest- ing that meditation may affect immune system functioning (Taylor, 1995; Carlson et al., 2003, 2007; Davidson et al., 2003; Hidderley and Holt, 2004 ). In one of the few rando- mized studies to examine the issue, Davidson et al. found that when compared to a wait-list control condition, 8 weeksof training in MBSR increased antibody titers in response to an influenza vaccine ( Davidson et al., 2003 ). In contradis- tinction to our results, no association was seen betweenmeditation practice time and immune outcomes, despite t h ef a c tt h a tm e a na t - h o m ep r a c t i c et i m e sw e r es i m i l a r between the studies (2.1 sessions per week in Davidsonet al vs. 2.8 in the current study). While the reasons for thisdiscrepancy remain to be determined, the current study extends Davidson's ndings regarding acquired immunity by demonstrating that practic ing meditation may also affect innate immune responses. Moreover , our ndings comple- ment the observation that MBSR enhanced responses to an immunological challenge by suggesting that the practice ofmeditation may also optimize immune responses to a psy- chosocial stressor. Findings from the current study may have intriguing health implications, especially if replicated with a design that moreEffect of Compassion Meditation on Responses to Psychosocial Stress 95denitively establishes a causal connection between medita- tion practice time and innate immune responses to psycho-social stress. Innate immune inflammatory signalingpathways are increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular Willerson Hiratsuka al., 2006 ), diabetes (Pradhan et al., 2001 ) and neurodegenerative conditions (Perry et al., 2007 ). Stress \u2014 and stress-related conditions such as major depression \u2014 have been repeatedly shown to berisk factors for these illnesses ( Evans et al., 1999 ). Interest- ingly, both stress (acute and chronic) and major depression are also associated with increased activity in innate immuneinflammatory pathways, suggesting that these pathways may be a mechanism by which stress and depression are trans- duced into medical illness ( Lutgendorf et al., al., 2006; Pace al., 2006; Danese et al., 2007 ). Moreover , the induction of innate immune inflamma- tory pathways in response to psychosocial stress may alsorepresent a mechanism linking stress to depression, given that humans chronically exposed to innate immune cytokines for therapeutic purposes develop high rates of depression(Raison et al., 2005 ). 4.3. Study limitations A primary limitation of the current study is that although we observed an association between amount of meditation practice and reduced IL-6 and distress responses to the TSST , the study design, combined with the lack of a main effect ofmeditation, does not allow inferences about the causalrelationship between practice time and these outcomes. Because we did not conduct TSSTs prior to meditation train- ing, we cannot rule out the possibility that individuals who a priori had reduced physiological/behavioral stress responses may have been more able or willing to engage in meditation practice. We know of no data showing that responses to theTSST predict the subsequent occurrence of a complex beha- vior such as practicing meditation. However , responses to laboratory stressors have been cross-sectionally associatedwith behavioral states such as depression ( Heim et al., 2000; Pace et al., 2006 ), which might affect ability to engage in meditation practice. Nonetheless, depressive symptoms at the start of the study in this non-clinical population did notpredict subsequent amount of practice in the meditation group, and no differences in depressive symptom scores at the start of the study were observed between participants inthe high practice, low practice or control groups. The ambiguity in our dataset regarding whether TSST nd- ings represent outcome or predictor variables has importantimplications for the potential of compassion meditation as an intervention for stress related conditions. To our knowledge, the question of whether pre-existing behavioral or physiolo-gical traits (such as stress reactivity) might predispose someindividuals to be more able to effectively practice meditation \u2014 and presumably gain greater benet \u2014 has yet to be addressed. The identication of such traits would be animportant step in targeting meditation interventions to indi- viduals most likely to benet ( Lutz et al., 2008a ). On the other hand, if our TSST ndings reflect a dose-dependent effect ofpracticing compassion meditation on innate immune and beha- vioral responses to psychosocial stress, this would suggest thatthe practice might merit further examination as a health intervention for conditions in which psychosocial stress isbelieved to contribute to pathogenesis. Clearly, an importantnext step in the evaluation of compassion meditation will be to address these issues with a study design that claries causal connections underlying associations between factors likely tomediate health-relevant outcomes, such as practice time, and those outcomes themselves. In terms of effects on stress responses, an example of such a design would be to administerthe TSST prior to and upon completion of meditation training in participants randomized to compassion meditation or a control condition. Given the long-recognized ability of cortisol to suppress innate immune activity, it is intriguing that participants who practiced compassion meditation had reduced IL-6 responsesin the absence of clear changes in cortisol reactivity to theTSST . The current study adds to a conflicting literature on whether meditation affects peripheral cortisol levels, and if so, whether it increases or decreases cortisol release ( MacLean et al., 1997; Robinson et al., 2003; Carlson et al., 2004; Robert McComb et al., 2004; Walton et al., 2004; Ospina et al., 2007 ). To our knowledge, only one previous study has examined theeffect of meditation training on cortisol responses to a labora- tory stressor and found results similar to ours. In that study , Tang et al. found that although engaging in meditation practiceacutely lowered cortisol levels; meditation training per se hadno effect on cortisol responses to a laboratory stressor when subjects were not actively meditating ( Tang et al., 2007 ). Nonetheless, it remains possible that we might have observedan effect of compassion meditation on other HPA axis hor- mones, such as ACTH, that were not measured in the current study and/or that associations may have emerged betweencortisol and other markers of inflammation had other markers of innate immunity been assessed. Similarly , between-group differences in cortisol responses to the TSST might haveemerged had the study been conducted in a larger population. Consistent with this, participants randomized to compassion meditation showed a trend ( p= 0.10) toward reduced cortisol responses to the TSST when cortisol was considered using anAUCimethodology. These factors highlight the importance of replicating the current ndings by examining a wider array of neuroendocrine and innate immune variables in a larger par-ticipant sample using a longitudinal design. Several additional limitations of the current study are worth noting. Although we implemented a health discussiongroup as a comparator condition to control for several non- specic aspects of meditation training, such as psychoeduca- tion and group support, that might influence stress reactivity,it is possible that other non-specic aspects of meditation training not well matched by the control condition may have contributed to study ndings. Because participants were toldat the outset that they were enrolling in a meditation study,randomization to the meditation group may have produced increased positive expectancy bias compared to the control condition, despite the fact that all participants randomizedto the control group were guaranteed meditation training in the next semester. Similarly, we did not specically assess participant perceptions of study instructors, and it is possiblethat differences in charisma between meditation and control group leaders might have influenced outcomes (in either direction). Finally, although participants in the health dis-cussion groups were required to complete a weekly self-96 T .W.W. Pace et al.improvement paper, this exercise matched neither the expected time commitment nor experiential nature of the''at-home'' meditation practice that was expected of parti-cipants in the meditation group. Thus it is possible that associations between TSST outcomes and practice reflect a generalized effect of the time and effort involved in practi-cing rather than a specic effect of meditation practice per se. An important next step will be to devise and implement at-home activities for the control condition that more closelymatch the time and tenor of the practice required to learn compassion meditation.
