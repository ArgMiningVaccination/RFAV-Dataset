Early in our training, bending over our cadav - ers, we learned to silence a part of ourselves. We learned the power of humor as a means of avoiding hard conversations about more complicated feelings. Often we kept those feelings to ourselves, rarely giving voice to them as we proceeded through far more challenging situations during our clerkships \u2014 a newly diagnosed lung cancer, a 2-year-old with an inoperable and therefore fatal brain tumor, a young man with quadriplegia from diving into shal -low water. We discussed the med - ical management and the compli - cations in detail and with intense care, but we could not give voice to the feelings these events evoked, often reducing them, in the for - mal case presentation, to the sin - gle word \"unfortunate.\" And because we cannot com - fortably express these feelings, sometimes we put them away for - ever or feel incompetent and over - whelmed when we do try to ex - press them. Perhaps if we could discuss this part of our practice lives as easily as we discuss a diagnostic dilemma or the proper management of a complex case, we might create a culture that supports and nourishes us as we try to come to terms with expe - riences that are part of our daily lives. Being able to communicate more honestly with each other might help us to do so with our patients as well.

Related article, page 1281 Do childhood vaccines cause autism? This scientific ques - tion has now become a legal one \u2014 perhaps inevitable in our so - ciety. Some families with autis - tic children are pursuing legal channels in an effort to prove that vaccines are responsible for their children's condition. Most of them allege that the cause is the mer - cury-containing preservative thi - merosal, which was formerly used in many vaccines in the United States and elsewhere. Others ar -gue that the culprit is the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vac - cine itself or perhaps the vaccine in combination with thimerosal. Although most experts have concluded that there is no proof of a causal tie between autism and thimerosal or the MMR vac - cine, some doctors and scientists, some groups representing fami - lies with autistic children, and many parents fervently believe there is a connection. Claimants not only want to prove that the federal government, the Institute of Medicine, vaccine makers, and mainstream science are wrong; they also want money. A child with autism is likely to require extraor - dinarily expensive services \u2014 and to have very limited employment prospects in adulthood. Besides, many parents of autistic children may feel better psychologically if they can blame profit-seeking drug companies for their chil - dren's problems.

PERSPECTIVE n engl j med 357;13 www.nejm.org september 27, 2007 1276have filed claims with the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Pro - gram (VICP) (see graph).1 This legislation was adopted by Con - gress in 1988 in response to a somewhat similar scare over the pertussis portion of the diphthe - ria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) vac - cine. Alerted to a possible link by British researchers, many observ - ers feared that the vaccine was causing some children grave neu - rologic harm \u2014 claims that were later generally discredited. Yet the alarm was so great that droves of British families refused the per - tussis vaccine, substantial num - bers of children became ill with whooping cough, and some 70 children died. In the United States, several parents sued the manu - facturers of DPT vaccines. Even though most public health offi - cials believed that the claims of side effects were unfounded, some families won substantial awards from sympathetic juries who were convinced otherwise. As a result, most companies making the DPT vaccine ceased production, and the remaining major manufacturer threatened to do so. Health offi - cials feared the loss of herd im - munity, and Congress responded by creating the VICP. This program provides com - pensation to children who have serious adverse effects from any childhood vaccine. The compen - sation covers medical and related expenses, lost future income, and up to $250,000 for pain and suf - fering. The funding for paying successful claims regarding vac - cines administered before 1988 came from the U.S. Treasury. For claims regarding later vaccinations, funding comes from a patient fee of 75 cents per vaccination. The VICP trust fund currently contains more than $2 billion. About 7000 claims have been filed for adverse effects other than autism, and so far about 2000 have resulted in compensation, in amounts aver - aging about $850,000. Approxi - mately 700 claims remain unre - solved, since the VICP frequently takes more than 2 years to pro - cess a petition. To win a VICP award, the claimant does not need to prove everything that is required to hold a vaccine maker liable in a product liability lawsuit. But a causal con - nection must be shown. If medi - cal records show that a child had one of several listed adverse ef - fects within a short period after vaccination, the VICP presumes that it was caused by the vaccine (although the government can seek to prove otherwise). An ad - visory committee helps to amend the list of adverse effects as the consensus view changes with the availability of new studies. If fam - ilies claim that a vaccine caused an adverse effect that is not on the list, the burden of proof rests with them. Autism is not on the list for any vaccine, and the VICP has rejected about 300 such claims outright. But thousands of autism claims are pending. In 2002, to resolve such claims more expeditiously, the VICP announced that some test cases would examine the gen -Cases in Vaccine Court \u2014 Legal Battles over Vaccines and Autism 2 colAUTHOR: FIGURE JOB: 35713No./uni0020of/uni0020Petitions/uni0020Filed3200 26002800 24003000 2200 2000 1800 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 1988 19901991199219931994 1989 199519961997199819992000 2005 2001200220032004 20072006 Nonautism claim s regarding post-1988 vaccinations Claims Filed with the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, 1989-2007.

Although this process was supposed to take only 2 years, the first of nine test cas - es was heard just this past sum - mer, with many witnesses testify - ing for each side. A special section of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims administers the VICP, and judges running this so-called Vaccine Court are not expected to begin to decide these cases until 2008. De - partment of Justice lawyers appear in opposition to the claimants. In the VICP context, proof of causation does not need to be shown to the extent of what some might call scientific certainty. Rather, it suffices to prove cau - sation according to the civil-law standard of \"the preponderance of the evidence,\" showing that causation is \"more likely than not.\" Although proving a mere possibil - ity won't suffice, proof \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" is not required. If the petitioners lose in the VICP process, their quest for com - pensation does not necessarily end there. Although persons claiming vaccine-related injuries are sup - posed to seek a determination through the VICP process first, anyone who is dissatisfied with the result can bring a regular law - suit alleging that a product is de - fective, and the named defendant can potentially be found liable. To win such a case, a claimant would have to persuade a jury that the vaccine not only harmed an individual child but also had a defective design or failed to carry adequate warnings. By offering a no-fault alterna - tive remedy that includes a chance to be heard, the VICP was meant to discourage litigation as a way of ensuring vaccine availability. Al -though some families have com - plained bitterly about the VICP, few who have been denied com - pensation by the program have then sued. The autism cases, how - ever, may play out differently if, as many predict, VICP judges re - ject the claims on the grounds of insufficient proof of general causation. Not only do families with autistic children have support groups and organized lawyers behind them, but they also have the backing of several prominent senators and congressional rep - resentatives. Indeed, several families have already tried to bypass the VICP process, going directly to court with creative legal arguments. Some assert that thimerosal is not included in the legal defini - tion of a \"vaccine\" or that it rep - resents an \"adulteration,\" so their claims should be exempt from the VICP process. The government and vaccine makers argue that such claimants must file first with the VICP, and so far they are generally winning on this is - sue. Other claimants are having better luck with different end-run approaches \u2014 suing companies that make thimerosal, for instance, arguing that the preservative sup - pliers are not vaccine makers; filing class-action suits on behalf of parents; or demanding medi - cal monitoring for vaccinated chil - dren who do not yet show signs of autism. Even in instances in which claimants are making mod - est procedural headway, such law - suits seem a long way from reso - lution. In Britain, meanwhile, an in - teresting counter-story is unfold - ing. Physician-researcher Andrew Wakefield and two of his col - leagues are in the middle of a hearing before Britain's General Medical Council, which is inves - tigating charges that could cost the doctors their medical licens - es. In 1998, this trio (with many others) published an article in - dicating that there were possible harms from the MMR vaccine2 (thimerosal was not blamed, since it was not used in the British vac - cine); the journal has since stated that it should not have published the article in the way that it did,3 and nearly all the authors have re - tracted their initial interpreta - tion of their findings.4 The case against Wakefield and his col - leagues is based primarily on ac - cusations about the way the re - search was conducted, and one charge is that Wakefield failed to disclose his connections to lawyers involved in vaccine litigation. The hearing is expected to last sev - eral months. Because American lawyers are now claiming that their clients' harms were caused by either thimerosal or the MMR vaccine or both in combination, whatever the conclusion of the Wakefield hearing, it is unlikely to end the U.S. battles over vac - cines and autism.
