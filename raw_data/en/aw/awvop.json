The scent is light and the powder goes on like silk. [ Rose Dusting Powder ](/products/rose-dusting-powder#judgeme_product_reviews) Dusting Powder Puff + Pouch [ Dusting Powder Puff + Pouch ](/products/dusting-powder-puff-pouch#judgeme_product_reviews) The Vanilla dusting powder is everything I hoped it would be. Soft, sweet smell without being overpowering. I am sensitive to smells and this is perfect. I will be a repeat customer [ Vanilla Dusting Powder ](/products/vanilla-dusting-powder#judgeme_product_reviews) I have never been able to find a perfume that suits me. They are usually too floral, or too masculine. The Eau de Provence Eau de Parfum has the perfect balance of floral, thanks to the fresh cut lavender and the jasmine, and earthy, thanks to the cedar. I also love how the perfume is vegan and cruelty free- and that the packaging actually has the ingredients. So reassuring that I am only putting safe products on my body. To say I am obsessed is an understatement. I can't wait to try some of the other scents out now! [ Eau de Provence Eau de Parfum ](/products/eau-de-provence-eau-de-parfum#judgeme_product_reviews) Smell so good ! , I love it!! [ Herb & Root | Perfumes, Dusting Powders and Massage Oils ](/#judgeme_product_reviews) Love this product. It smell so so nice [ Amber Perfume Oil ](/products/amber-perfume-oil#judgeme_product_reviews) The sample pack of the five scents I chose were delivered within a couple of days. I loved them all. I felt that the cost of $10.00 was reasonable for the samples and when a coupon for $10.00 was in my sample pack, for use on my next purchase, I really appreciated it. It was a nice introduction to Herb and Root. I look forward to placing my next order with them. [ Perfume Oil Discovery Sample Set ](/products/perfume-oil-discovery-sample-set#judgeme_product_reviews) I used to have a beautiful yard which I filled with over 50 roses. All kinds, all unique. They filled my home & heart with their beauty & scents. Older now, no where at all to grow roses. But, with Herb & Roots perfume Roses & Attar of Roses, I can again luxuriate my senses & fill my heart with their lovely, calming scents. Before bed, I will dust a tad of Rose powder in \"hot\" spots. Then I pour Attar of Roses massage oil in my hands. Cup up to my nose & inhale the wonderful, heart healing scent. Then I gently massage on my neck & chest, using the heat of my palms to press the oil into my skin - leaving some for the back of my hands. The oil is very light in texture & scent. Last, I use tad of the Rose perfume on my temples, behind ears, wrists & circle \"root\" chakra. Makes it sooo easy to imagine sliding into bed that's covered in the sweet cloudlike softness of rose petals. I keep my hands near my face & drift away with love in my heart. Tis what roses do - open your heart to love. Big plus that my chest, neck & hands are rose petal smooth from using nightly. Super Fine job, Herb & Root! [ Rose Perfume Oil ](/products/rose-perfume-oil#judgeme_product_reviews) Fragrant, tropical light scent. Put it on a clothe (tiny bags perfumes come in are perfect), place it in pillow wrap & use imagery to take me far away to isolated lagoon in tropical paradise. Feel sun warm me while listening to the pulse & music of the waves. Almost instantly, peaceful sleep & wonderful dreams. What a bargain! [ Tiare Tahiti Perfume Oil ](/products/tiare-tahiti-perfume-oil#judgeme_product_reviews) I really love this Santal Perfume Oil. I got the rollerball and I love that it has a metal ball in it. This is perfect for travel or just taking with me for the day. I love the Santal fragrance. Its somewhat masculine but mostly unisex in my opinion. I enjoy the way this smells quite a bit! I am now very curious to try the other scents offered by Herb & Root. The scent quality is excellent! [ Santal Perfume Oil ](/products/santal-perfume-oil#judgeme_product_reviews) I can't stand heavy perfumes or fragrances, I tend to get very bad headaches from strong smells. This however, was delightful and just a small dap goes a long way. [ Attar of Roses Perfume Oil ](/products/attar-of-roses-perfume-oil#judgeme_product_reviews) I love this product. The fragrance is so sweet and soft. I love how smells is like a vanilla and floral. I recommend so much in special for use in spring and summer. I love this perfume oil. [ Vanilla Bean Perfume Oil ](/products/vanilla-bean-perfume-oil#judgeme_product_reviews) I tested many of the different essential oil perfumes from Herb&Root, Frankincense & Myrrh is the most calming for me. It is wonderful. [ Frankincense & Myrrh Perfume Oil ](/products/frankincense-myrrh-anointing-oil#judgeme_product_reviews) I'm a girl who /loves/ smelling edible~ (brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, etc) and even though this perfume isn't my usual scent, it still gave me the same warm and sultry scent!! I LOVE IT! [ Amber Eau de Parfum "}
