Availability date: Anthroposophical medicine is conventional medicine with an added extra dimension. For all its invaluable achievements, conventional practice is limited by its foundation on natural science - the science of the physical world. Diseases are analysed in terms of cellular disturbances and drugs prescribed to counteract physical symptoms. Yet, in order to understand what brings physical matter to life and imbues it with thoughts, feelings and will-power, it is necessary to add anthroposophy, or spiritual science to the picture. Anthroposophical doctors qualify in conventional medicine, then complement this with anthroposophical training, thereby increasing the therapeutic opportunities at their disposal. Not only do they offer the possibility of a cure when conventional treatment can only suppress symptoms but, through the range of therapies available to them, they can also reduce dramatically the need to use conventional drugs. These principles are used worldwide by many doctors and complementary practitioners. |Auteur||EVANS Michael, LAIN Rodger| |Rayon||Conseils pratiques et divers| |Editeur||THORSONS| |Published||1992| |Pages||192| No customer comments for the moment.
