In this period you will conceive, design, develop, initiate, and possibly deliver differing teaching events, such as daylongs, class series, and sitting groups . For this first Practicum, you are invited to do it individually. In future exercises you will be asked to work with your Dharma Consult Group or any other group configuration that you decide upon. The first practicum will be about creating, designing and developing a daylong retreat. The assignment is to document five components: (1) a daylong description with topic, (2) retreat schedule of the entire day, (3) a detailed outline of the dharma content of what you would like to cover, (4) a short bio with a description of your qualifications or experience that might draw people to your event, and (5) some thoughts about how you would bring people into the event, i.e. an outreach plan. This last point is the invitation to be conscious of your intended audience \u2014is the event for all practitioners, for certain levels of practice, for topical interests, for certain demographics, for certain professional groups, for certain practice skills? As a reference document, we are enclosing a generic program proposal form that is distilled from several meditation centers. Please use it to guide your own thoughts and descriptions. Please be aware of what your intention is behind creating the event. Is it to fulfill the homework requirement? Is it to try something that you h ave not done before? Is it to practice your dharma, creative, and organizational skills in sharing the Dharma? How will you open the daylong? What kind of Introductions or Beginning Process would you design? How traditional or non- traditional will you go? When selecting a topic and designing the description, you might consider a general Vipassana practice daylong, a general daylong on Metta practice, or a more specific topic about the Four Noble Truths, or Mindfulness, or one of the Brahma Viharas. If you are teaching in secular contexts, please adjust your content accordingly. If you are not using the CDL5 program to teach, but to develop leadership in the Dharma, you are invited to go through the exercise. There is benefit to know what the teaching commu nity does in order to provide leadership for this important aspect of the community. When creating the day schedule, consider the balance and timing of the sitting and movement and presentation periods. How long is lunch? Are there breaks in the day? How much time is there for engagement and community connection, process, and questions or comments? CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 6 When developing the outline of your daylong content, please articulate briefly the content of each session, including the silent sittings. What kind of instructions will you be giving for the silent sittings? How will you approach movement? How will you integrate Lunch? What is the content of your Dharma Talk or presentation? How will you frame shifting into communication and process? Will there be a Question and Answer or Question and Comments period? How will you close the daylong or end the day? As with all the Practicums, we will be collecting all the homework and collating them into a resource document that will be sent back out to all CDL5 participants as examples of how to manifest and live each of your Dharma teaching roles. Please be sure that you are comfortable with sharing your piece with the whole program. If you feel that the materials that you create are unique to your voice, one way to still share them is to \u00a9 copyright them with a \"do not duplicate or distribute without permission\" designation. If it's helpful, you can imagine that this course or program is for either a general audience or a specific population. As part of this exercise, think about the outreach or publicity that you might do for this event. Who would benefit from this event? Where are they likely to see your information? How can you deliver that information to increase the benefit and impact of your event? At the next retreat, you will have time to share the assignment components #1, #2, and #3 of your daylong with a few colleagues to get feedback. To facilitate this, please bring 3 copies of your draft version to the retreat. (There will not be copying available on-site. Please do not ask the managers to do this for you.) Over the remaining year- plus time in the program , see if you can manifest your daylong within whatever communities or groups you wish to serve. Accordingly, we invite you to start assessing the Dharma needs in your community and how you might consider serving them. Again, we would enc ourage you to be very creative. Perhaps there is general need for Dharma in your geographic region, or an un -served or under-served populatio n, or a particular Dharma need with which you feel inspired to assist. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 7 Daylong outline Margaret Smith Description: An Insight Meditation (Vipassana) daylong that includes instructions, silent sitting and walking meditation, and a dharma talk. Emphasizing cultivation of mindful awareness, this daylong is suitable for both beginning and experienced meditators. Purpose: To introduce insight meditation to those who are interested but not yet practicing , and to provide an opportunity for group practice to those with some experience. (I am planning this daylong for participants from my own small community and nearby towns where there is interest in learning about insight meditation, and also a small group of individuals already practicing) Schedule: 10:00 am Opening and introduction to Insight Meditation, followed by silent sitting with instructions 11:00 am Walking meditation instructions and walking meditation 11:30 am Silent sitting with brief guidance 12:15 pm Lunch (preceded by brief instruction) 1:30 pm Silent sitting with brief guidance 2:15 pm Silent walking 3:00 pm Silent sitting with brief guidance 3:45 pm Silent walking 4:30 pm Questions, reflection, comments 5:00 pm Closing and dedicatio n of merit Dharma content: Calming the mind, observing one object, observing the breath. Awareness of physical objects and sensations through the sense doors: seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching. Use of noting: hearing being known, thinking being known, etc Awareness of feelings - and the connection between thoughts and feelings, between negative thinking and negative feelings arising, between positive thinking and positive feelings arising. Use of noting: thoughts being known, thoughts arisi ng, feelings being known, etc Awareness of states of mind - desire, aversion, delusion. Noting wanting (wanting more of, wanting less of), noting aversion (reactivity, irritation, anger, etc) \"Meditation is about seeing clearly the body that we have, the mind that we have, the domestic situation that we have, the job that we have, and the people who are in our lives. It's about seeing how we react to all these things. It's seeing our emotions and thoughts just as they are right now, in this very moment, in this very room, on this very seat. It's about not trying to make them go away, not trying to become better than we CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 8 are, but just seeing clearly with precision and gentleness.\" Pema Chodron -- Excerpted from The Wisdom of No Escape \"In insight meditation, you are observing the rising and falling of the breath and the phenomena that arise in the mind and body. So there is a shifting of the mind from sensations felt, both painful and pleasurable, to thoughts as well. Whatever is happening is to be noticed, then that will go away, and another thing will come. In this way, insight practice is a method of observation. All six senses [the mind being the sixth] will arise. Just watch them arise and pass away and come back to the feeling of the breath. Anything you see, anything that comes to mind, just be aware of it.\" Dipa Ma Bio: Margaret began meditating in a small monastery in Bali where she was introduced to the Mahasi method of Vipassana. She has studied with Sumarah teachers in Java, lived at the Findhorn Foundation in Scotland, and studied with Buddhist teachers in the United States, including Joseph Goldstein, Steve Armstrong and Richard Shankman, as well as with U T ejaniya in Burma. Margaret's devotion to Buddhist practice and love of travel have lead to a deep belief in the value of retreat and pilgrimage as a way to nurture and inspire a life dedicated to a spiritual calling, to develop caring and open-mindedness, and to cut through habitual patterning which may obscure our abilities to see and understand with wisdom. This belief has inspired her to seek avenues to provide this type of life -enhancing experience for others. Outreach: This daylong will be advertised in my local community, by google group and town notice board, through friends with sitting groups in nearby towns, and through my Marin DPP sangha, as well as social media. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 9 Pauletta M Chanco The Daylong Description: Catching the Clinging - a Transformative Journey Come and explore with me for an entire day, ways in our practice and daily life, that we move towards clinging which Buddha has taught is the cause of suffering. We will begin the day hearing about the small ways in which we can practice seeing and catching the clinging. These less consequential moments of clinging is our training ground to help us when clinging in a big way in our lives could have adverse results for us. At the same time, give yourselves the gift of a day of practice, stillness and reflection so that the spiritual nourishment gained, will do a lot to reinforce positive behaviours and ways of relating to ourselves and others that are beneficial and wholesome. The Retreat Schedule: 9:30-5pm 9:30 - 9:40 Introduction, lo gistics, welcome, setting an intention for the day. 9:40 - 10:10 Guided Meditation (focus on the breath; calm, stability, comfort and relaxation) 10:10 - 10:30 Walking meditation (instructions given in the beginning 10:30 - 11:00 Dharma Talk (How we can observe clinging in any degree of intensity in daily life and spiritual practice) 11:00 - 11:20 q and a 11:20 - 11:50 Silent sitting meditation (no guiding) 12:00 - 1:30 Lunch 1:30 - 2:00 Silent sitting 2:00 - 2:30 walking meditation 2:30 - 3:00 Silent si tting 3:00 - 3:30 Dharma Talk (Transformative aspects of catching the clinging) 3:30 - 4:00 Walking meditation 4:00 - 4:20 q and a 4:20 - 5:00 dana talk, closing ritual (each one say what received from the day) Detailed Outline of Dharma Content: Morning Talk: The Second Noble Truth; 3 kinds of desire and how each leads to clinging; simple ways to practice Afternoon Talk: Process of Recognition; Different forms of clinging that we notice in daily life Short Bio: Pauletta Chanco has been practicing meditation since 1998 and is also a professional artist and full time householder - married with 3 children and 3 grandchildren. She completed the Buddhist Chaplaincy program at the Sati Center in Redwood City in 2012 -2013 and during this time, also was a Zen Hospice volunteer at Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco. Pauletta created and continues to teach at Alameda Sangha since 2010 with two CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 10 other dharma teachers. As she offers the dharma, Pauletta brings her own daily life householder practice with complex family relationships as part of the teachings that resonate with those who have chosen to walk this path without giving up a lay life. She feels that the ultimate challenge is to walk the path and have less suffering without needing to resort to becoming a monastic. Outreach Plan: I have always used my art publicist to get the word out. The publicist has been quite successful in reaching many in the community to come to all local dharma events. The first night that we met together as newly created Alameda Sangha, there were 18 attendants who were coming for the first time. She has also sometimes gotten my daylong events written up in the local Alameda papers which has helped to increase attendance. I will also create postcards with my web designer to circulate in local cafes, markets and other public places. My audience is the local community of Alameda for anyone interested in deepening their practice and it is open for beginners and experienced practitioners. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 11 Steve Wilhelm daylong 1. About the daylong: This daylong will end a six-week introductory class, the latter comprised of six Monday evening sessions, two hours each. The audience will be a mix of people from two introductory classes, one from Seattle and one from the region directly to the east, called the Eastside. In addition, we might expect some more experienced practitioners, people attracted to a simple day of mindfulness. The primary focus of the daylong will be to give a taste of deeper practice to people who have gone through the six-week program. The idea is to stretch them a bit, but not too much, because we want them to have some sense of success or satisfaction. Therefore the topic might be: Deepening your practice, and bringing it into your daily life. 2. The schedule: The daylong will be from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on a Saturday, at the Seattle Insight Meditation Society center in Seattle. 9 a.m. - Arrive and orientation. Welcome people, some of whom won't have visited the SIMS Seattle center before. Give them a sense of the day, and the wonderful opportunity it is to sit and practice without any interruption. Offer a few words refreshing the practice, before we sit. Will touch on the four foundations, to help them ground in their bodies. 9:20 a.m. - sitting meditation 9:50 - First talk. 10:20 - break for 10 minutes 10:30 - sit for 30 minutes 11:00- walk for 30 11:30 \u2014 sit for 30 minutes 12:00 \u2014 break for lunch, with instructions to be mindful of eating, and also if talking. 1 - Second talk - Questions and sharing, reminder of four foundations. 1:30 - sit for 30 minutes 2 - walk for 30 2:30 - sit for 30 3 - Third talk - 30 minute talk on taking the practice into the world, and going deeper into practice 10 - minute break 3:40 - last sit, for 30 minutes 4:10 - closing thoughts and feelings. Hear from people about what they need going forward. End on a positive note. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 12 3. About the content: A. First talk - Tell them that while a day may seem like a long time, it's just comprised of multiple short sessions. And once they've done this they could easily tackle a longer retreat, which is just comprised of multiple days. Suggest that people relax into practicing now, that they let go of the pressures of their daily lives. Give them the instruction to primarily re st their attention on their breath, to make this day a special place. Open up what longer practice can mean, the opportunity to deepen what they've been learning during the six weeks. Remind them the practice is not to stop thinking or to force a still mind, but rather to stretch mindfulness to be aware of everything arising, with a centering place in the breath. Refresh the idea that freedom is to be found in this mindfulness, that when we're mindful of something arising we're less stuck to it, more fluid. B. Second talk - We'll start with any questions that have arisen. What's uncomfortable? What thoughts or feelings have been arising repeatedly, and how have people worked with those? From there segue into discussing the constant change of things, imper manence, and our sense of self, and how clearly linked they are to mindfulness. Without getting too technical, there's a way to frame this in terms of freedom, and that as we see everything constantly moving, we realize there's nowhere to be stuck. Also we 'll touch on the idea of cultivating kindness, and how it arises naturally from being aware. When we're aware of others' arisings and passings, and our own, we realize we aren't different from one another, and kindness arises. C. Third talk - This last talk will be about practice in the big world, and how powerful and transformational it can be. We'll work off the joke about \"welcome back to the real world\" after long retreat, and develop the idea that becoming aware about what's going on in the moment is far more real than being lost in thoughts and feelings. Some areas to develop: - How to create a regular sitting practice, and what this can bring us. - How to bring family difficulties into the path. - Work meditation, and the sacred mindful path from desk to restroom. - The fact that the deluge of junk in our minds from work is exactly that which we need to be mindful of, and is our own doorway to freedom. - Also exploring longer practice, what we can learn about that from this retreat. D. Closing t houghts and feelings - A chance for people to be heard about what may or may not have been meaningful. - A chance to respond to last questions or issues about bringing practice into life. - Offering a sense of local and other resources, an invitation to Eastside or SIMS. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 13 4. Biography: Steve Wilhelm has been meditating since 1968, and engaged in Buddhist practice since 1987.

Thank you for understanding.] Day of Mindfulness Patience - An Act of Self- Compassion Patience is an act of self- compassion because it is we who suffer when we are impatient. This act of self- compassion is a gift to us that gives rise to equ animity, which results in peace and well- being. In this daylong, we will explore the relationship between patience and self-compassion. Patience carries the heart through the difficulties of life by recognizing the cause of suffering. We will explore the se and other aspects of patience with guided and silent sitting and walking meditations, share within a context of mindfulness and compassion, and listen to a presentation on patience. There will be time for questions at the end of the day. The Full Day of Mindfulness is an opportunity for extended meditation practice, which offers us the simplicity and quiet to gently investigate what arises. It is scheduled for October 29, 2016 at Innerlight Center for Yoga and Meditation from 9 am to 5 pm. Cushions, chairs and other props are available at the studio, but please feel free to bring your own if you'd like. Dress comfortably, in layers and bring a boxed lunch and something to drink. This facility is wheelchair accessible and we invite all practitioners who are interested, regardless of physical ability, race, gender, or sexual orientation. This workshop is appropriate for both experienced and beginning meditators. RETREAT SCHEDULE 9 - 9:30 10 minute AOB meditation Introductions and why you are here (if group is small) Guidelines for the day Taking care of yourself Noble silence Availability of the teacher Confidentiality Talking from our own experience only - no advise giving 9:30 - 10 Introduction to patience: What is patience? What is patience not? Impatience is: Wanting this experience to be different than it is. Reacting rather than responding. (i.e. anger, aggression, blame) Having expectations that are not met. Not having control over the situation. It SHOULD be this way. Wanting instant gratification. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 15 Definition of Patience - Patience is the capacity to accept or tolerate delay, difficulty or annoyance without getting angry or upset. Is there anyone who does not experience delay, difficulty or annoyance? Maybe even on a daily basis? Patience is an act of self- compassion because it is we who suffer when we are impatient. This act of self- compassion is a gift to us that gives rise to equanimity, which results in peace and well- being. Today see if you can notice when patience is present and notice when it is not present by using a technique called RAIN. Explain RAIN technique. Use example - getting cut off in traffic (my Achille's heel.) Recognize if impatience/patience is present; Allow the experience to be there, just a s it is; Investigate with kindness as a child would on body level; Natural awareness, which comes from not identifying with the experience. Guided sitting practice (taken from Kamma and the End of Kamma - Ajahn Sucitto) \" Establish a supportive bodily p resence: a sense of uprightness, an axis that centers around the spine. Connect to the ground beneath and the space above and around the body. Acknowledge sitting within a space, taking the time and space that you need to settle in. As you settle, let your eyes gently close. Attune to the bodily sense through feeling the breathing: first in the abdomen, allowing the breath to descend through the soft tissues.... Feel the flexing of the breath mirrored by the effortless release and firming of the abdomen in re spiration. Attend to the upper body, consciously dropping the shoulders and opening the connecting tissues between the upper arms and the main trunk.... Allow the breathing to subtly flex the chest. Open the head by relaxing the jaw and settling the tongue in the floor of the mouth. Relax around the eyes, the forehead and the temples. As if you were removing a scarf, or unbuttoning a collar, let the neck feel free and the throat open. Feel the breathing move through the throat from the throat notch, up thro ugh the back of the mouth and out through the nose and mouth. As you establish this body reference, settle into it, checking in with the specific points from time to time. If you feel unsettled - snagging flurries or sags of energy or mood - draw attention down your back to the ground, allowing the front of the body to flex freely with the breathing. Refer to the 'descending breath' - down through the abdomen - if you feel bustling or uptight. Attune to the 'rising breath' - up through the chest and throat - if you feel sunk or flat. As you come to a sense of balance, bring to mind a situation in your life\" where you were impatient. Not the worst- case scenario, but one that you can look at without getting hooked. Maybe when you got cut off in traffic or a person you interacted with that had a bad attitude. Perhaps notice if you are impatient now with this task. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 16 Use the RAIN acronym to investigate the scenario. (Review RAIN). Remember that we can suppress our reaction to impatience or act it out, either w ay making things worse for others and us. This is especially evident when with react with anger and aggression. Or we can practice patience; wait, experience the impatience and investigate its nature. Use RAIN to determine whether or not patience is prese nt during the daylong. I will ask you periodically if patience or impatience or neither is present. If impatience is present, you can use RAIN or you can ask the question, What would patience look like or What would patience mean right now? 10 - 10:30 Walking practice 10:30 - 11:15 Sitting practice 11:15 - 11:45 Walking practice 11:45 - 12:30 Sitting practice 12:30 - 1 Bag lunch 1 - 1:30 Walking practice 1:30 - 2:15 Sitting practice 2:15 - 2:45 Walking practice 2:45 - 3:30 Dharma talk - Patience - An Act of Self- Compassion 3:30 - 3:45 Mindful Break (instructions how to do this.) 3:45 - 4:30 Sitting 4:30 - 5 Questions, discussion, closing CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 17 DHARMA CONTENT Introduction (see above) Dharma talk (outline) Personal story One of the first retreats I attended was on the four Brahma- viharas. The teacher suggested that there might be a fifth and that it was patience or khanti. She described patience as \"Emptying the ocean with a teacup.\" I think that that is such a great analogy - and for me it even creates the feeling of restlessness and \"Oh, no!\" That the impossibility of it can't be endured and immediately I can feel the impatience. Wanting the analogy to patience to be different than it is!!! For me being patient with my practice always requires self-compassion. Self-compassion for daydreaming, thinking I am not doing it right, being restless, being sick, having excuses for not sitting, etc., etc., etc., etc. I could go on... Patient endurance: The foremost austerity. \u2014 Dhammapada 184 Patience is best known as one of the paramis (khanti) or perfections. The Buddhist translation of khanti is to forbear or endure and even to accept and embrace. It is the virtue that appears in the absence of hatred, repugnance and malice. It is an attitude that arises from Bodhichitta rather than from any guidelines imposed from outside. I'm still working on the accepting and embracing.... Overview of paramis The perfections are the 10 wholesome characteristics that lead to enlightenment. They can be cultivated both in daily life and on retreat. Khanti is the 6 th parami - It is the invitation to accept things as they are. What if I don't want to accept things as they are? Ever been there? Notice who is suffering when we don't accept things as they are! Explore what the resistance feels like in the heart, body and mind. Notice what arises with impatience; not only anger and aggression, but also self- pity, despair, blame and loss of humor and joy. Can we bring in self-compassion when this suffering arise s? What would patience look like right now? Patience is an act of self- compassion because it is we who suffer when we are impatient. This act of self- compassion is a gift to us that eventually gives rise to equanimity, which results in peace and well-bei ng. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 18 Aware of Subtleties Impatience can be extremely subtle, so bring your awareness to that situation when you have a subtle feeling of being delayed or annoyed, which gives you a clue that you are impatient. Andy Puddicombe describes how to eat a p iece of chocolate mindfully. He suggests breaking off a piece of chocolate from the bar, taking a few deep breaths, and appreciate where the chocolate came from and how many people were involved in bringing you the piece of chocolate you have in your hand. Then he says, \"Before you begin to eat, pause to notice if there's a feeling of impatience...\" Does the delay in eating the chocolate create impatience? So subtle.... Just so our hurry and distracted lifestyles create a feeling of impatience. We feel that we need to be at another place or be doing something other than what we are doing. We simply want it to be different than it is! There are three aspects to patience. 1. gentle forbearance or gentle perseverance 2. calm endurance of hardship 3. acceptance of the tru th Gentle perseverance This gives us time (a pause) to restrain ourselves long enough to determine how to respond skillfully, rather than reactively. Pema Chodron suggests that this is a form of courage because we allow the de -escalation of aggression and suffering to occur. Gentle forbearance is the spirit of forgiveness. Injury is forgiven and the occasion is used as an opportunity to reveal the essential harmony of all beings. Examples - An exhausted parent of a child having a fit or a family member once again saying something hurtful. Endurance of hardship All of life is difficult, but being with it all. An example is chronic pain. A student had a diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome (formally known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy) where chronic arm or leg pain develops after injury, surgery, stroke or heart attack. It has no cure, isn't well understood but may involve abnormal inflammation or nerve dysfunction. This student's right arm was affected (she is right -handed) and her initial reaction to my suggestion to start to make friends with the arm, which she had dissociated herself from, was complete disbelief. But with time, she started to engage with the arm that at one point she couldn't even look at. Basho says (having taken shelter during a storm in the rude dwelling of a frontier guard) while he was on pilgrimage: CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 19 Fleas, lice, The horse pissing Near my pillow. Translated this koan/poem means \"and these things too.\" In other words, this is suffering too and it is part of life. Le t it happen. Dukhha is resistance to suffering. It is the anguish we feel when we don't want to suffer. Not wanting to accept the way it is right now. [Not wanting to wait to eat chocolate, not wanting to bother with the extremity that caused pain.] Patie nce is motivated first by an acceptance of and compassion for our own suffering rather than a desire to eradicate it. Can gratitude and acceptance arise, rather than resistance? Can we work with RAIN to find this more accepting place? Acceptance of the truth A MBSR student came to each class with her story of how her mother was not spending money on her own grandchildren, but buying gifts for her partner's grandchildren. This woman said it affected all the relationships in her family. She took this matter on as her mission. When she told her mother that it wasn't fair and created problems, her mother agreed, which confused and deepened this woman's suffering. I asked her if she could just accept the situation and she said no. I asked her if her mom was suffering and she said that she seemed comfortable with the situation. I asked her how she felt and she described the physical sensations that accompanied her anger and confusion. I asked her who was the one that was suffering.... When we want life to be other than it is, we suffer. Patience allows us to accept things as they are. Our experience is constantly changing. We sometimes think that impermanence is difficult, but it can be our friend too because everything changes. To recognize this requires profound w isdom and compassion and the knowledge that we are here for the long haul. There is great power in patience because it cuts through arrogance and ingratitude. It is the path that lets us move from resistance to acceptance and spontaneous presence. Holding on to our judgments about others and ourselves is a major cause of impatience. Repeating softly to ourselves \"may I be happy just as I am\" and \"may I be peaceful with whatever is happening\" is the act of self-compassion. We can then accept our vulnerabilities, imperfections and losses: chronic physical and emotional pain, the death of loved ones, and the end of a job or relationship. Ajahn Succitto talks about acceptance without expectation. He says, \"patience deals with checking emotional reactions, but it's not a denial of emotional intelligence.\" In dealing with the suffering he suggests creating some space around the suffering (the pause I mentioned earlier), then remember that we can let go of the suffering. Then investigate to see if you can find the hook that got you there. \"This takes patience. Patience holds us present with the suffering in a spacious way, encouraging the mind to open. And an open mind both feels more peaceful in itself, and more readily sees into the cause of its suffering.\" CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 20 He continues \"Pure patience is the kind of acceptance that acknowledges the presence of something without adding anything to it or covering it up. It is supported by the insight that when one's mind stops fidgeting, whining and blaming, then suffering can be understood. Closing Gil Fronsdale adds, \"The ultimate perfection of patience does not come from endurance or a re -evaluation of a situation. Rather it comes from the absence of our habitual, automatic triggers and reactive hooks to the challenges of life. Fully mature patience is effortless; it is not a doing at all. .... the opposite of impatience is not patience but rather contentment. By not chasing after the whims of the ego, we have the chance to discover deep contentment that manifests in our life as great patience.\" BIO Priscilla is a mindfulness meditation instructor who integrates her 30 years experience in the health care field as a nurse (oncology, critical care, nurse anesthetist), medical editor and most recently, epidemiologist with he r commitment to meditation for well- being, health, and insight.

Let's come together on this daylong retreat to experience - A Taste of Happiness and Peace. Beginning with a brief description of The Four Noble Truths and then emphasizing the Third Noble Truth - the cessation of suffering, we will explore the one common understanding of what frees the mind: liberation through non -clinging. Throughout the day we w ill discover how we can work with non -clinging in our formal practice and in our daily lives to decrease our stress and open more to the moments of release that become available to us. The day will be a combination of sitting and walking meditation, inter active exercises, dharma talks and time to meet with the teacher. The fee for the day is $25.00, but no one will be turned away for lack of funds. RETREAT SCHEDULE (10:00 - 5:00) A TASTE OF HAPPINESS AND PEACE 10:00 Welcome/Introduction Introduc ing myself.

I will include a summary of the Four Noble Truths ending with a deeper exploration of the Third Noble Truth. 2. Understanding \"upadana\", the Pali word for clinging, clinging of the mind to an object. I will illustrate this with Thanissaro Bhikkhu's essay, The Karma of Questions. 3. Before lunch, a description of mindful eatin g and its benefits. There will also be a description of Noble Silence. 4. A teaching on the Three Characteristics. This includes sense pleasures, impermanence and no solid self. I will be using some of my own experiences throughout the talk. 5.

We will look at its unchanging nature which is already within each of us. I will include The Eight Fold Path that as our way to Nibbana. We will examine how it is accessible to us in small moments as Householders, and what we can look for. 6. Ending the day with Metta and The Sharing of Blessings BIO Amy Selzer has been practicing meditation since 1995 and has been a student of Buddhism since 2003. She taught children with special needs for over 25 years and worked with premature infants and their families as a Special Instructor through Downstate Hospital. She leads several sitting groups, one in Park Slope Brooklyn, and a few at NYI - The Li ving Urban Dharma Group, The Dedicated Practice Group and the Orientation Group. Amy is presently participating in the CDL5 Community Dharma Leader's Program. Her passion is sharing the dharma in many communities and connecting to others through the dhar ma with warmth and kindness. OUTREACH From my experience participating in and leading sanghas, I see that many people are interested in exploring the end of dukkah which is usually what brings them to the practice. Since we all suffer to some degree we w ant to learn ways that may help us reduce our stress, pressure, anxiety, etc. in order to experience more happiness in our lives. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 25 This would be an event for practitioners at all levels of practice. The experienced meditator can benefit from reminders, rev iew and reinforcement of the dharma. At different times on our Path we experience the dharma in new ways that were not available to us previously due to either internal or external conditions. For the newer meditator, the structure, small and large group i nteractions and meetings with a teacher, offer support and the opportunity to listen to and share experiences related to the topic, which helps to deepen one's practice. From my own experience I can say that I often learn the most listening to and sharing with other practitioners. The outreach for the retreat would be posted on our Brooklyn Google group, in which a monthly newsletter is posted to include special events. It could also be announced in the other sanghas that I lead and participate in. It could possibly be posted at NYI on their bulletin board and passed along by word of mouth. Last but not least - Facebook. The venue might be The Brooklyn Zen Center, St. Augustine's church or possibly the space used in Park Slope for Brooklyn NYI weekly meditations. I envision 15 -20 to attend since that is the number that generally attends our retreats. Each of the spaces I mentioned above could accommodate that number.

What background and experience prepares the teacher to lead or teach the program? I have been practicing insight meditation for 25 years, after ten years experience in contemplative Christian communities. During that time, I was also developing my landscape architecture design practice, engaging in social justice work and raising a family. 8. Why do you want to present this program? I am learning to live mindfully and passionately with all that life presents, and am aware of the tendency to speed up and heat up that is so easy to slip into, and can cause such suffering. I was specifically moved by the recent early death of the great architect Zaha Hadid. 9. Is there any other information that would help us review this proposal? Outreach: I would like eventually to reach out to the local artists and designers in Austin through landscape architecture and architecture schools and professional organizations. For the first go-round, I would use the Mariposa sangha mailing list. This has been a topic of interest and discussion in the sangha. Dharma topics: Within the general topic of mindfulness of thought, I would like to explore, especially in guided meditation and experiential exercises, the following: Viewing thinking as process, rather than content Experiencing spaciousness in thought The experience of 'Flow' and how it relates to mindfulness, concentration and samadhi Thinking and self-compassion CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 35 Bob Agoglia A Workshop for Dharma Leaders and Guiding Teachers This day long workshop is an introductory overview effective leadership and governance practices of dharma organizations.

It is a state of being calm, balanced, and also completely engaged, especially in the midst of action and difficulty. Developed equanimity helps us avoid the near miss of indifference and its opposite habitual reactivity. This practice is a necessary support of the other boundless positive mental qualities such as loving kindness, compassion, and appreciative joy. Throughout this daylong of practice we will explore equanimity through talks, guided meditations and quiet reflection. It is suitable for anyone interested, from beginning meditation students to advanced practitioners.

We will practice mindfulness of breath and body in stillness, and using Chi Gung movements, we will practice \"off the cushion\" with various aspects of body awareness, especially postures, activities, and elements. 2) Schedule & Dharma Content See attached. 3) Attendance This daylong is intended for adults. It could be taught to a group as small as 5 or to a crowd of more th an 50 people. 4) When Depends on the venue, space availability, approval, etc. In Tucson, some time between November -March, 2016 -2017. In San Francisco, maybe early 2017. 5) Venue In Tucson at the Shaolin Kung Fu Academy where I am a guiding teacher. In San Francisco at San Francisco Insight or Against the Stream. 6) Teacher compensation A fee charged as needed to cover costs associated with rent, registration, etc. and dana offered separately by participants to the teacher. 7) Teacher background/bio I have been a Vipassana meditation practitioner since 2000. I have studied and taught Shaolin Ssu, a Chan Buddhist martial arts form, since 1978, earning a 7th degree black belt and the title \"Si Po,\" feminine for \"Master.\" I have deep knowledge and exper ience with mind -body awareness and psychophysiology \u2014from long study and teaching of biofeedback and various Chi Gung and Tai Chi forms \u2014and I've gravitated toward dharma teachers who relish the nitty - gritty aspects of body awareness. I am a psychotherapist and offer a mind -body/mindfulness focus in my work with clients. For many years I have taught/led groups for people with chronic pain and serious illness, and I am particularly attuned to helping people safely mobilize and rest their bodies, cultivating a 100% non -harming approach. I have taught Chi Gung in the Insight community since 2004, including on residential retreats. I love integrating Dharma practice with Chi Gung, offering a safe and joyful way for people to experience their bodies in stillness an d motion with greater clarity and kindness. 8) Why present this Some aspects of the First Foundation of Mindfulness aren't taught very often or are mostly CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 41 taught in stillness. This daylong gives an opportunity to learn about and get an experiential taste of each aspect: breath, postures, activities, elements, 32 parts, and Maranasati. Practicing mindful Chi Gung in tandem with meditation is an easy and pleasant way to experience greater awareness during simple activities, and it builds a bridge between mi ndfulness in stillness and mindfulness in motion that can help to carry awareness into all aspects of daily life. 9) Outreach Plan In Tucson \u2014 The students at the Shaolin school in Tucson are accustomed to my teachings when I visit, so posting a flyer at the school and asking other teachers to make announcements is all that is needed. I would also do outreach and send flyers to a CDL4 graduate who lives in Tucson and to the Tucson Community Meditation Center. In San Francisco \u2014 If I teach a daylong at SF Insight or Against the Stream, I would rely on their web postings, live announcements, and flyers distributed at their regular sits, and I would send email announcements to my own list of Chi Gung students and other colleagues and friends. 10) Other help ful info One of my central intentions for being in the CDL is to bridge my Theravada meditation practice with my Chan Buddhist practice of Shaolin. Deeper study of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness has given me rich insights into the connections between these two divergent approaches. I am excited to offer sutta -based mindfulness practices to the martial arts students I work with and to bring the wisdom of mindful movement to Insight practitioners.

They will also be encouraged to notice each time we shift from straightforward mindfulness into other m odes such as contemplation or visualizing (as with the 32 Parts, 4 Elements, and Maranasati). Chi Gung moves, while using mindfulness, often encourage an intentional shift into a more optimal state, which is different from simple mindfulness. Bringing care ful attention to these shifts can help practitioners learn skillful options and notice their underlying intentions, shifting consciously rather than out of grasping or aversion.

Traditionally it is said that the Buddha taught lovingkindness as an antidote to fear, but the practice is also used as both a concentration practice and an insight practice. Above all, lovingkindness is a powerful way of accessing the radiant intelligence of the heart. The day will include practice session s of the core forms of lovingkindness and will also include periods of walking meditation, inquiry and discussion. A talk on the benefits of lovingkindness as validated by research will take place before lunch. Required: Some previous experience with medit ation. Schedule : 8:30-9:00 Sign In & Arrival 9:00-9:15 Introduction to Lovingkindness & The Brahma Viharas 9:15-9:30 9:50-10:10 Lovingkindness for Self with Debrief 10:10 Walking 10:30 -10:40 Break 10:40 -11:00 Lovingkindness for a Good Friend with Debrief 11:00 Lovingkindness for a Neutral Person with Debrief 11:20 -11:30 Walking 11:30 -11:50 Lovingkindness for Difficult Person or Enemy with Debrief 11:50 -12:10 Lovingkindness for All Beings 3:00-3:45 Small Groups & Full Group: Takeaways, Integration, Next Steps, & Sharing 3:45-4:00 Closing Ritual Dharma Content: The day is conceived as an intensive introduction to lovingkindness meditation from the perspective of Buddhist practice and teachings. Metta and the other brahma viharas will be introduced in the morning conceptually, including their place in Buddhist meditation and Buddhist psychology. Scientific evidence attesting to the effectiveness of lovingkindness as a practice will be presented in a brief slide show lecture just before lunch. Practice periods will be short - about 15-20 minutes each with time for debriefing and discussion after each one. Practice will start with a period of mindfulness of breathing, and then will proceed with sessions of lovingkindness for various categories CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 46 of people, starting with the benefactor and proceeding to lovingkindness for self, a good friend, a neutral person, a difficult person, and all beings. Participants will be encouraged to cultivate lovingkindness during their lunch hour. The afternoon will include a period of radiant lovingkindness, and a comprehensive 5-stage practice bringing together most of the categories of people. Throughout the day periods of walking meditation will be spaced out between sitting practice, with possibly the chanting of sabbe satta sukhi hontu (\"may all beings be well and happy\") during one of these periods. During the end of the day participants will break into small groups and share their key takeaways as well as how they intend to integrate the practice of lovingkindness into their lives. The key takeaways and the setting of intentions will then be shared with the large group. A closing ritual will end the day. The day will be o pen to the general public, but requires that participants have some experience with meditation. Notices will be sent to my existing network of secularly - minded practitioners, as well as to other Buddhist and Insight meditation communities as deemed appropriate. The day is thought of as a fee -based day, with a sliding scale of $50-$150. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 47 BETH SHOYER Program title: Mindfulness of the Body. Spend the day bringing your awareness out of your head and into your body. Please describe the program , including its content, theme, and purpose . This program will introduce and deepen participants' practice of the first foundation of mindfulness. It will progress through the five contemplations and bring together traditional sources and practices with co ntemporary writings and dialogue. It's purpose is twofold; deepen practice and inquiry into body awareness, and increase awareness of relative and absolute body experience. The latter will open the door to acknowledging aspects of this relative human physical experience that affect first foundation contemplations. This might be recognizing the impact of being discriminated against because of a physical attribute, recognizing the impact of being differently abled and/or recognizing the impact of past trauma or other psychological experiences. Since it is a daylong, it will purposely be a general introduction into these latter aspects and an invitation to explore further following this day's experience. Please give a schedule of the day's events with amount o f time allotted for various activities, including meditation periods . 8:00 - 8:30: Check-in and Getting settled. 9:00 - 9:45: Welcome.

I will advertise the retreat on our sangha listserv which consists of people who have requested to hear about sangha events. I will also list the event on our webpage and post it on our Facebook page. In what month and year do you propose the program occur (or start)? May, 2017. This will be prior to when many people leave town and during a time when walking outside may be possible. What would be the program's venue? Showme Dharma is a Vipassana Sang ha in Columbia, Missouri. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 48 How would the teacher(s) be compensated for leading the program? The retreat will be offered on a Dana basis. What background and experience prepares the teacher to lead or teach the program? Beth Shoyer has been teaching mediat ion at Showme Dharma since 2001. She has been practicing meditation for approximately 17 years. Her main Vipassana teacher was Ginny Morgan. She has trained in Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction with Jon Kabat - Zinn, Saki Santorelli, Florence Meyer, and Melissa Blacker. She has trained in Insight Dialogue facilitation with Gregory Kramer. She is currently participating in Community Dharma Leader training through Spirit Rock Insight Meditation Center and the Insight Meditation Society. She is being mentored b y Phil Jones. Beth has taught in community settings including university campuses and medical settings. She currently works and teaches at an eating disorders treatment center. Why do you want to present this program? A day of practice focusing on Mindfu lness of the Body can be a wonderful awakening experience for beginners and advanced practitioners. It can provide fundamentals for beginning a practice and a beginner can leave with a felt sense of mindfulness, important insights, and tangible practice instruction. Advanced practitioners can receive new perspectives and entries into deepened contemplation. Mindfulness of the Body can be rich with new insight, inspiration, and healing opportunities. A day of practice and inquiry in this are can make a true difference. Outline of Content Welcome.

CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 50 Trauma & Spiritual Practice: Daylong Retreat with Sean Feit Oakes (1) daylong description with topic Title: Trauma & Spiritual Practice: Skillful Tools for When Mindfulness Doesn 't Work Description: Central to the Buddhist path is a profound inquiry into suffering (P li: dukkha ) and its cause: habitual contraction around both pleasant and unpleasant experience. The medicine for this suffering lies in our ability, with training, to remain alert and vibrant through both ease and difficulty. In Buddhist meditation, the practices of mindfulness ( sati), skillful attention (yoniso manasik ra), and loving -kindness (mett ) depend in large part on the practitioner being able to settle the mind and heart in the present moment, focused on experiences as they arise. Many modern practitioners, however, find even this most basic aspect of meditation very difficult, and may spend years wrestling with anxiety, self -doubt, regret, and overwhelming emotions in meditation. In many cases this difficulty stems largely from unresolved trauma and early life distress. This daylong retreat will introduce the basic principles of Organic Intelligence\u00ae, a mindfulness and compassion -based clinical protocol and map for h ealing that integrates beautifully with Buddhist practice. Restoring healthy nervous system function and cultivating resilience, OI strengthens the ability to be relaxed, embodied, and present, deeply supporting meditation and other spiritual practices. Th is way of working can shift stuck habits in meditation for even long -time practitioners, and can be transformative for those both with and without \"trauma\". We will practice meditation, gentle yoga, and conversational exercises that everyone can do, learn ing to decrease stress and build the ability to be present with difficult experiences without overwhelm. All bodies and minds are welcome.

CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 55 Ian Challis Part I - Daylong description with topic Sustaining and Nourishing your Meditation Practice How do we support and sustain a meditation practice? How do we hold both its joys and challenges? In your practice y ou may have experienced moments of great peace and clarity, and you may have experienced days when questions arise: Is this working? Am I enjoying my practice? Why does my mind still wander, after all this time? Does this really happen to everyone? In this daylong practice retreat, we will learn techniques to keep our practice fresh and interesting. Through practice periods and discussions we'll explore ways to support the habit of practice, how the Buddha taught us to work with the \"troublesome\" mind -states, how to use the qualities of investigation and curiosity, and how to listen to our inner wisdom to teach ourselves when the going gets rough. This retreat will be most helpful to those who have some previous meditation experience. Whether you have a r egular practice, an occasional one, or whether you are hoping to develop a practice, you will find this day useful and inspiring. We will alternate seated practice periods, with walking, movement, lunch and discussions. Please bring a thoughtfully chosen lunch that will support your well -being.

Instructions \u00a7 What brought you here today? What inspired you to begin a meditation practice? \u00a7 Bringing Energy and a spirit of Investigation t o the day, Vicaya. What is happening now? What is this? Bringing this curiosity to the day and allowing it to show us what we need to see. Why do you practice meditation? (interactive) Where does practice feel difficult (interactive) \u00a7 Discuss benefits of pr actice: Greater awareness of the moment resulting in more choice/freedom Creating wholesome habits that can replace old patterns A pleasant abiding/refuge Generating concentration - clear seeing, leading to insight and wisdom. \u00a7 The Buddha taught these suppo rts: Intention/Resolve Sila - morality/virtue Guarding the sense doors. Non grasping. Renunciation. Mindfulness in our actions Having the four requisites = food, clothing, shelter and medecine A \"solitary lodging\" \u00a7 Invitation to sitting practice now: Coming to that \"solitary lodging\": Simply working with mindfulness of the breath as though for the first time. Without judging or changing, simply noticing what happens as you stay on the breath or bring attention back to the breath. Every time you come back to the breath allow yourself to feel joy, (rather than any sort of judgement). B. 1:30 Afternoon Dharma Talk Introduction: \u00a7 \"The long and winding road.\" My own experience. Why practice? Wider view. The Buddha's simile of the Ocean Shelf - gradual training, p rogress. The reality of the practice holds challenges (even for senior teachers). Among the challenges that arise: resistance; boredom; doubt; blind habit. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 57 Balancing of effort and resolve (supports) and gently allowing unfolding of wisdom and joy (the fr uit). Being our own friend and teacher. Returning to the cushion (Aspiration and Habit) \u00a7 Even for the most experienced meditators this can be a challenge. (examples) The perfect is the enemy of the good. Showing up. (Chuck Close: Inspiration is for amateur s; the rest of us just show up and get to work.) \u00a7 Making a clear choice, a commitment: Right Resolve - \"the exertion of our own will to change\". Revisiting your aspiration often. Examples from simple to complex. Allow yourself to refine it over time - a living thing. \u00a7 Supporting our practice by what we do off the cushion: Sila, Mindfulness, Compassion. Remembering our aspiration. Creating a feedback loop. \u00a7 Remembering the benefits, the fruits of practice. \u00a7 Relieving ourselves of decision points. Choosing a reg ular time, place, setup. Routine. Value of a kind of \"retreat container\" in creating ease and calm. Setting up your own retreat even if it is for an hour or less a day. Recognizing the power of habit, the fact that we are great at creating habits, but most of them are unconscious. A sense of the sacred if helpful. Honoring our intention toward liberation. \u00a7 Recognizing that a feeling of wanting or not wanting (to sit) is temporary and is less powerful than our aspiration. \u00a7 Honoring your intention as closely a s is possible: if too tired, can you take a step in your direction of intention? (dragging myself out of bed and laying on the floor, etc.) How to take care of ourselves on the cushion, working with difficulties (Compassionate Wisdom) \u00a7 Preliminaries Preliminaries: something you read, a chant, listening to the metta sutta, making an offering, beautifying the space in some way. Taking your seat intentionally, mindfully, with self -respect. Arousing joy and energy (both factors of enlightenment): Gratitude, As piration, Determination, Metta. (This is \"gladdening the mind\"). \u00a7 Working with the Hindrances or Nivaranas - coverings/obscurations. The Buddha called them \"overgrowths of the mind\". Notice them, See into them, Work with them. Sensual Desire. Wanting, fantasizing or craving stimulation. Strategies: Returning to the present, realizing the enoughness of this moment, contemplating impermanence, and (esp. off the cushion) working with mindfulness of sense doors. Ill-Will. The gripe fest of the mind. Strategies: Refrain from fanning the flames. Arouse compassion, lovingkindness. Sloth and Torpor. Sluggishness of body and mind. Strategies for tiredness: move, open eyes, perception of light, stand, and (esp. off the cushion) note what contributes to this: time o f day, diet, etc. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 58 Strategies for mind: Present moment curiosity, (what is this?) Remembering your aspiration, the unique value of this moment. Brahm: doing and knowing are functions of the mind, calming one and not both. Restlessness and Remorse. Again physical and mental. Strategies for body: Investigate the restlessness, see if you can watch it pass. Focus on where there is comfort. Strategies for mind: Appreciation of the moment. Contentment with unfolding exactly as it is. Remembering your commitme nt to Sila/harmlessness. Awareness and acceptance of emotions. (example of memory, shame literally causing me to leap off the cushion). Doubt. \"Telling ourself stories that sap our confidence\". Strategies: Remembering the benefits of our practice, the Bud dha, our teachers, archetypes, the universality of the dharma, spiritual friends and mentors. Our deepest aspirations. Note: Also be sensitive to the uses of doubt, is this a story or is there something here I need to investigate? Working with Hindrances as a practice. Not just an obstacle to be overcome, but as a rich ground. We start to see our habits of mind. Seeing them with mindfulness we gain insight as to what may be going on when we are not mindful. There is a general antidote: \"the more you pay a ttention, the more it wears itself out.\" \u00a7 Self Compassion Balancing effort with kindness to self and the process. Remember the gradual training/ocean shelf. Patience with the process and ourselves. Recognizing the universality of the experience of the hindr ances. (Mogallana and sloth, the Buddha tempted by Mara: Sensual desire, doubt, etc.) Valuing the practice, (again gladdening the mind) and ending your sit with recollection, awareness of impermanence, resolve to practice off the cushion. Noting insights and remembering them. They are never forgotten, but it helps to review them, (Ayya Khema). Companionship of spiritual friends and sangha. Keeping Practice Fresh - Beginner's Mind and Teaching Ourselves (Curiosity) \u00a7 The most effective tool in making the pra ctice alive for ourselves is cultivating Beginner's Mind, or shoshin . \"In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's there are few.\" (Suzuki Roshi) Intentionally looking freshly, with an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions. Curiosity, investigation, vicaya (another of the 7 factors) (what is this? What is this now?) Expert's mind or beginner's mind Experts carry a lot of \"shoulds\". Beginners luck is a misnomer. Creating a map and confusing it with reality . What is more fun: to think we know everything or to be learning everything? CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 59 Being open to what is new or defending knowledge? \"Fixed views\" are opposite of flexibility and the unfolding nature of the universe, they lead to dukkha. Always learning. Enjoy ing being a student. Reminding yourself of the wonder and improbability of it all, a sense of awe and openness. Let the emphasis be on the investigation, the learning. We are starting over endlessly. Literally. We let wisdom arise on its own, we don't need to \"do\" it. Like a seed germinating it can't be forced or easily stopped. Letting go of where we think we should be and letting the process carry us as though walking that ocean shelf. \u00a7 Being your own teacher, owning your wisdom The Care & Feeding of th e Mind (Ajaan Lee) \"It's like knowing how to look after a small child. If the child starts crying, you know when to give it milk ... when to take it out for some air, when to ... give it a doll to play with. The mind is like a small, innocent child. If you're skilled at looking after it, it'll be obedient, happy, and contented, and will grow day by day.\" What have you learned through your own investigation that works? What leads to wisdom, peace, equanimity? Getting interested however you can. (Teacher: the breath is much more interesting than you think). Appealing to whatever it is that gets you interested, you will know this better than anyone. Contemplate what you may need. Mix it up -- we have many tools: postures, the way we experience the breath, t he objects of mindfulness we use, the practices of metta, forgiveness, etc. Ayya Khema, \"Whatever works.\" Allow yourself to be inspired, think of new ways of practicing. (Examples: metta tea, seeing the breath as ocean, external breathing.) Allow creativit y to inform your practice not out of boredom, or restlessness but when there is a feeling of stuckness. When your wisdom informs you the moment requires a response. Concluding thought: \u00a7 Let go of expectations. Trust the gradual training of mind and heart. Be kind to yourself and the process. Use the hindrances as a practice. Release judgement or attachment of a particular experience in favor of the whole - the gradual movement toward liberation. (Joko Beck) \"We don't need to judge our sittings as good or ba d. There's just, \"I'm here and at least I'm aware of some of my life.\" And as I sit .... that percentage tends to go up.\" Part IV - A short bio with a description of your qualifications or experience that might draw people to your event.

CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 64 Brian Simmons Mindful Fitness: Social Emotional Learning for 21st Century Educators Mindfulness has recently become a buzz word in Education. But what's behind the buzz? This intensive day long workshop is designed for Educators looking to implement proven Mind/Body strategies in the classroom to lower stress and boost performance for students of all ages. High stakes testing, increased performance expectations and rigorous teacher evaluations have created an environment of unparalleled pressure for teachers and students. Missing from this equation has been a path forward that energizes rather than depletes. Join us for a day of practice that will provide a practical framework for awakening joy and calm on the road to success in the classroom and in life.

Brian created a nd currently teaches an accredited Mindfulness Course for High School students, the only one of it's kind in NYC. He has introduced Mindfulness to the Department of Education and will be teaching Mindfulness to Freshman students at Baruch CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 65 College in July 2016. Brian was trained at UMASS Medical Center and has been practicing daily mindfulness since 1999. Mindfulness in Education is a hot topic, but not much material is available from Educators who have created an accredited course, and are actively implementing it with students on a daily basis. I have innovated a successful curriculum, gathered compelling results data and earned hard won lessons along the way. This treasure of trove of experience will be beneficial to educators looking for practical st rategies that have been successful in a NYC Public School. If you can make it here...

Content, theme and purpose: Too often we subtly resist what is happening in our moment to moment experience, wanti ng or wishing for something else, thereby resisting what is. In this daylong, we will practice relaxing, opening, deepening and cultivating our awareness of what arises in the moment and meeting it with friendliness, interest, curiosity, and non -resistance , as well as exploring the characteristic of impermanence (annicca). Opening to what is allows us more freedom and joy in our lives. The purpose of the content and theme of this daylong is to cultivate more friendliness towards our experience and meet i t just as it is. By bringing awareness to how things are in this moment, and understanding that all that arises also falls away, we can meet experience with more curiosity and less attachment. This workshop is for all levels of experience. 2. Schedule: If possible, to sit in a circle (even if large). Brings a sense of inclusion, and an archetypal feeling of belonging and interconnection.

Other information to consider May be co -taught with another facilitator CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 73 Bruce Pardoe FEELING CLEARLY TOUCHING THROUGH SUFFERING TO EMBODY FREEDOM DESCRIPTION: \"You've got to feel it to heal it\" so the saying goes. Like most basic wisdom we resonate at an innate l evel with the truth of this message. W hat is the path of liberation other than healing the basic misunderstanding or wound of a sense of separat ion, iso lation, loneliness and abandonment that compels us into a stressful, neurotic relationship with life? This healing does not happen through intellectual understanding, it has to be experiential and lived. Experience is gained through direct contact and feeling. You've got to feel it to heal it indeed. In this daylong retreat we feel clearly the root cause of our suffering through 1) embodied exercises that can be performed seated or standing, 2) music and 3) practical teachings. We feel suffering so thoroughly and clearly that we touch through it to the simplicity, balance and naturalness of the freedom that it has obscured . A taste of liberation is available in a moment, not after years of practice. But a taste is not the full meal. The second half of our day focuses on sustaining our freedom in wondrous and fresh ways. Whether you are brand ne w to meditation or highly experienced, this day is designed to inspire and illuminate your practice.

Emphasize that all exercises can be done seated or standing and that any exercise that is not comfortable for any reason can be missed. Intention: Inclusivity - \"I hope that all of who you are feels welcome and safe here today - your age, gender, sexual orientation, race, economic situation, weight, physical ability, hair color, clothing, movie preference - all of you.\" Participation - Your presence here is enough. There is no need for you to fabricate anything. Our intention is to touch into what is unfabricated, authentic and free in ourselves. Participate at the level that seems right for you and open to your lived truth, but know that this is a safe non -judgemental container and you are invited to join in. Purpose - Today we open to our freshness dropping out of our stories into feeling clearly the possibility, wonder and immediacy of our lives and inherent freedom. Dharma Content - All of the mate rials presented today are grounded in the ancient, well articulated spiritual traditions of Vipassana, Advaita and Devotion which have collectively led millions to freedom. Embodied exercises are also informed by the disciplines of Feldenkrais Awareness Through Movement, Hakomi Body -Centered Psychotherapy, and Contact Improvisation dance. Dedication - Today's practice is offered for the well-being and benefit of ourselves and the web of being of which we are. May our intention to share our joy, discovery an d growth augment and amplify the beneficial energy that by default extends into that web due to our wholesome actions. Guided Sit: Feeling as Sensation 9:10 Drawing on the first foundation's fifth reflection of the elements, yogis have a direct experience of their bodies as a collection of sensations. We explore a fifth element of spacious awareness as the container for these sensations and open to the flow of experience. I start with a brief verbal, eyes open intro by using the metaphor of a clear vase with silty water. If we simply set it down we can see clearly after the silt settles. If we try to move one piece down maybe with chopsticks we just muddy the water more. A few words on mindfulness - non- judgemental, non -reactive attention with an aw areness that experience is being known - self-reflective at some level. There is a caring, kind element to attending to our present moment experience in the same way we would be tender with a child. What do children really want after all? Our loving attent iveness. That is what our lives want too. Establishing mindfulness of breathing by counting the breaths is offered in the first five minutes. With the attention a little more settled, we open to sensation in breathing for a few minutes. Then we open to th e body and go through the sensations and how to label them in a direct manner. The question of the space in which the sensations arise is CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 75 introduced. The last 20 minutes are spent in silence with 1 or 2 suggestions to return to the breath if the attention has wandered. Talk/ Q&A: Feeling & Movement 9:50 This is basic, standard 1st foundation of feeling as sensation and movement instructions that you would hear on any retreat, and that I use in the Intro to Meditation course that I've been teaching at Mountain Stream for the past few years. Given time constraints, I will not elaborate it just now.Questions are invited from the yogis and posed to them. Walking Period: Feeling & Movement in Practice 10:20 Building on the Feeling & Movement talk, y ogis are given walking instructions that extend mindfulness of the elements into movement. Break 10:45 Talk: Feeling Clearly - Separation to Suffering 11:00 Vipassana is often translated as \"Seeing Clearly\". I'm an intellectual type and have needed to develop my felt sense of life. I'd been using the conceptualizing power of mind to try to create a sense of safety since I was a child. After I had a basic framework of understanding the dharma, I needed to let it go and actually feel the experience it was pointing to. The finger pointing to the moon is not the moon and you can study honey all your life and never truly appreciate it if you haven't tasted it. That is when \"feeling clearly\" as a definition for Vipassana arose. Seeing was too close to the head I had been over- using. Feeling clearly dropped my attention down into the body and heart, and I've started orienting to experience from there more and more. The core wound - how a sense of separation arises: Based on Chogyam Trungpa's descrip tion of ego formation in \"Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism\" I offer the following... Imagine a very young infant that has no words, no concepts, no history, no baggage. Sound cool? They are completely fresh and this is one of reasons we are so amazed by them. Have you noticed how, with a newborn, people become quiet. With a sense of wonder and awe, and in a breathless way they often say things like \"Oh my god, it is so precious.\" Why? Here is a being purely alive. Experience simply being known with no clinging. Purity. Openness. Fluidity. Guess what? We've all been there. In fact we are all there at some level right in this very moment. Today is about that. At some point, though, something scary or painful arises that gets stuck in the system. A reflexive contraction that does not release is formed and with it the message \"Protection is needed.\" Suddenly there is an 'out there' and an 'in here'. Fear is born. Individuation has now begun leading to separateness, the root of all misery. In a world with experiences that run the gamut from enjoyable to excruciating, how is protection attained? The only apparent strategy available is to get more of what is CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 76 likable, and keep out what is objectionable. Wanting more and less. A mind and being that moves towards and away from experience. It sets up a neurotic seesawing. Remember that for most humans, this is their very first concept. Preverbal. At the very root of conditioning. All experience in some way accretes or relates to this one basic misunderstanding and all the suffering of this world is born. A frightened, \"me\" appears that needs constant attention drowning out the joy, spontaneity and ventilation of life. \"How was I? How am I? How will I be?\" As the neurotic star of our own movie, we relentlessly move from one hopefully pleasant moment to the next, craving ever more as if we were drinking saltwater to quench our thirst, and bemoaning the inevitable challenges and pain that a body feels. Of course, there are genuine moments where all this drops and we feel at peace. Relaxed. Natural. Full. Content. If there weren't, we would all go insane. Feeling the 2nd Noble Truth Vignette On an idyllic early summer day in 2014, I returned to my childhood home at the mouth of the Rappahannock River. In this rural area of Virginia known as Tidewater, life used to be slow and paced like the tides themselves. After 30 plus years, I didn't know what I'd find. Surprisingly, the beauty of the area was largely intact. My wife and I crept our rental car down the dirt road to the tip of Mosquito Point where the old house had been perched. Would it even still be there? Was it ok to do this? Would we be chased off? With relief I noticed from the name on the mailbox that the next door neighbors - summer visitors from North C arolina - still owned their house. With no car in their driveway, I pulled in and we crunched to a stop. There it was through the bushes; unchanged, almost as if it had been trapped in amber. Home. Or what had been. Now, though, there was a stranger's m inivan next to the house. Somehow I felt timid, as if I were an impostor - a voyeur - out of time and out of place. But there was my old friend the river, and the neighbors sun swept dock beckoned with warmth and safety. My wife and I mounted the wooden planks leading out onto the water. With each step, my tension drained through the cracks between the boards. By the time we reached the end, I was deeply moved. I had lived for years by this river, and yet I was meeting it for the first time. Fresh. Not lost in thought, agenda, story. Thank you Buddha. Thank you practice. An osprey floated above with a small fish in it's talons and two rays glided by like water- bound spaceships, their uplifted wingtips slicing the water. A gentle breeze caressed our skin and the sound of the wavelets washing the dock pilings cradled our hearts. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 77 In the face of such overwhelming beauty, we laid down and let it all in. Drawing a long deep breath, I felt into a simple and natural enoughness; a sense of completeness, of ease , of not needing anything else. We all recognize these moments of safety and okness to one degree or another. Nothing to do, nothing to be. For a moment, maybe longer. In this instance, my system melted. Literally. An innate, unseen sense of separation collapsed like a kicked tent, revealing lightness and fluidity. Experience just happening and being known. Life flowing of it's accord. The physical feeling of this experience was exquisite and distinct. Open. Ventilated. Untethered. Yum. Seemingly moved b y life itself, without thought and yet intensely aware, I rolled to my side and kissed my wife's cheek. Looking over her smiling face, I saw my childhood house. That is when it happened. All over the globe, people fish using throw nets. Casting one out, it opens into a beautiful, flat wide circle. When retrieved it pulls up from the circumference thru a hole in the center forming what looks like a snarled upside down pinecone. In the moment after I kissed my wife and saw the house, the thought arose, \"W ouldn't it be nice to walk over to the old place and see it up close?\" With the speed of hummingbird wings, the open net started pulling in on itself and the pinecone began forming. That one seemingly insignificant and innocent desire drew other thoughts and energies to itself. \"Was there anyone home? What would I say if there was?\" A whole verbal rehearsal started. My hands clenched. My jaw tightened. An \"I\" was becoming who wanted something more. My mind and my being leaned towards the object of desire. A stress and struggle around an agenda to get more of what I liked had appeared. Then the next remarkable thing happened. My system recognized that it wasn't as open and relaxed as it had been a moment ago. In a flash the pinecone was the open net again wh ich then dissolved into the day. Whoa. Wow. Cool. How obvious. How basic. That is exactly the second noble truth. Tanha; thirst. Moving towards. It causes suffering. Stress. Dis ease. Becoming something. And if it is so for moving towards, it is also tru e for moving away. Liking. Disliking. To see it. To feel it. What an incredible gift. If attachment had more deeply happened, think of all the suffering that could have happened. \"I might be creeping through the bushes right now\" I thought. The desire pop ped up again. There came the pine cone. \"Let it go!\" joyously arose and she comes! And thar she goes! Next I noticed that I had become the one who was playing the bwoop and swoosh game and started having an avalanche of thoughts about this remarkable experience and what it all meant. Good old proliferation at a wildly abandoned pace. Too funny. Next I CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 78 desired to be nothing again and there was the suffering of wanting again. \"We're all just Pinocchio's b eing danced around,\" I mused, \"but it's an interesting spectacle when we show up for it. Illuminating too.\" With mindfulness we see this stressful process unfold in myriad ways, yet with the basic core simplicity around wanting less or more , over and and over again. The mere act of awareness shining on the suffering and feeling it clearly reduces its power and we begin to know the pull to balance and freedom. We gradually verify the authenticity of our innate capacity to be present and let go. Faith stoke s our interest in our right to be free and know the end of suffering. The end of suffering comes by knowing and feeling clearly that very same suffering as intimately as any lover. Neem Karoli Baba said \"Suffering is grace.\" Indeed . Exercise with Q&A: F eeling Thru Suffering to Liberation 11:30 At this point I offer an exercise for pairs which I have utilized very successfully in the Intro to Meditation series at Mountain Stream and at Your Place Too. I demo it with a volunteer first and show how it can be done seated or standing. Anyone uncomfortable with this level of contact is invited to opt out. Anyone who has an injury or limitation in movement is reminded not to move outside their healthy and comfortable zone. The effect of this exercise can be achieved with remarkably little range of motion. Participants are advised to find a partner who is roughly their height. They select who will be the initial wanter and who the not wanter. We stand or sit facing each other at an arm's distance apart. People standing have one leg forward and one back which creates a stable stance and they first agree on which leg will be which. Next they each place the hand from the opposite arm of the forward leg on the center of each other's chests. The arm should be fully extended without a significant bow They ask each other \"Is my hand in an ok position for you?\" Next the free hand is placed over the hand on the chest solidifying the connection and shared stance. Seated people sit to the side of their chair so the back does not impede movement. They then determine which arms they will use to place their hands on each others' chests. Based on this selection, they position their chairs a little to the side of each other. This is facilitated by volunteers helping to move the chairs and assist the participants with movement and ample time is allowed for it. When the participants are in place I ask them to drop their attention into their bodies. Notice thoughts or stories about what is happening only in order to let them go. When you notice the attention has wandered, drop it back down into the body. Be curious. What sensations are present? How does the body feel? Is it relaxed or tense? Try to settle in and open to any relaxation that might be available. Feel your contact with the earth. How is your weight balanced over your hips and flowing into the earth which holds it? How is your spine? Your neck? Is your jaw relaxed? How about the eyes? Feel the contact of the hands. Notice the breathing. Can you relax and open the breath? CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 79 When there is a sense that folks have become more embodied I ask the wanters to lean forward with their arms still stretched out and in contact with their partners. The not wanters lean away. The pairs do this to the extent they are able without losing balance, contact or comfort. At this point I ask them to maintain their positions of leaning toward and away. Drop the attention into the body. Be curious. How does this feel? Feel your contact with the earth. How is your weight balanced over your hips? H ow is your spine? Your neck? Is your jaw relaxed? How about the eyes? Feel the contact of the hands. Notice the breathing. Is it deep or smooth, shallow or ragged? ? Do you feel relaxed or stressed? I let the participants hold the position as long as see ms useful and then have them come back to uprightness while maintaining their hands on each others' chests. They are advised to breathe deeply and slowly and reground attention in their bodies. Next, they switch roles and do the exercise again. The third and final posture is one in which both participants drop their roles as wanters and not wanters. They become connecters by agreeing to meet, contact and connect with experience without forcing anything. In this posture they simply both allow their body we ight to shift into connection with each other with an equal amount of pressure and they hold each other up. Without doing it yourself, it is hard to imagine how profound such a transition can be. People have teared up as they felt their partner gently, se curely meeting them; holding them. They often enter a place of balance and ease. It is so clear. Leaning toward and away was very stressful. Being in direct balance is peace and freedom from the rocking back and forth. Freedom from the bondage of a strateg y that imprisons us. There is then an extended Q&A. Some people didn't get the exercise or felt uncomfortable, but I have never experienced the lack of a majority who did not get the intended message. Dharma around freedom being the cessation of this stru ggle often comes out as well as connection and oneness; non- separation and meeting life just as it is without a me agenda. Cool. Sit: Feeling Suffering & Liberation 12:00 With lunch approaching, yogi's are invited to integrate the exercise into the silence and explore how the mind moves towards and away especially as regards lunch - how good the food will be, how nice it will be to have free time or to go on a walk, any pain in their body they want to get away from, whatever. When they notice the min d caught moving toward or away they should pay particular attention to any related sensation in their bodies; is the jaw tight, how are the shoulders, the forehead, eyes, tummy, hands. Is there any sense of contraction or vibration in the torso? Importantl y, though, those moments when the mind stops bouncing around are to be noticed. What does that feel like in the mind?:In the body? Can we open to the liberation and basic sanity or enoughness of those moments? CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 80 Mindful Lunch Break 12:35 Instructions are offered on mindful eating and maintaining the silence as well as the invitation to continue to notice the movements of mind and body. Movement into Sitting 1:30 Starting with several repetitions of the Qigong movement of Gathering Heaven's Qi, we transition into sitting and invite the silt to settle in the clear vase of our beings. The intention is offered to continue to notice movement in the mind and moments of balance, and there is a reminder that the afternoon will focus on maintaining our freedom. Walking Period: Feeling Liberation in Movement 2:00 During this walking period, yogis are advised to notice balance as an embodied experience. How can they open to balance. To remember the feeling of liberative balance from the pre -lunch exercise, they can assume the same posture used with their partner and lean into a wall or tree. Notice balance in standing and then in entering into movement. How is their breathing? Are their shoulders is balance in What is the feeling in the mind? Spacious? Tight?... Exercise , Talk with Music & Video: Feeling Wonder 2:30 When we stop moving toward and away from experience, we become open and balanced. With us as it's instrument, life plays it's own unique notes. Two years ago I was struck by such a clear example of this quality in an article in the New York Times about the artist Lonnie Holley. ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/magazine/lonnie - holley -the-insiders -outsider.html ) This guy is just wide open to the flow of creative energy. During an interview at a diner, he took a cigarette butt from an ash tray, ripped the paper off the filter, pulled apart the fibers at one end and impaled it with a toothpick at the other creating a makeshift brush. He then poured some water in the ashtray stirring the ashes into a sooty ink and began painting on his paper place mat, all while talking a blue streak. What an amazing being. His art is represented by leading galleries in NY selling for significant sums, yet he is as natural to himself as ever. Neither wanting or not wanting, he flows seamlessly with life. He finds creative materials wherever he is - from a storm drain, a junkyard, an inner city lot, nature, whatever. He also sings stream of consciousness music with a synthesizer that he has never formally learned to play and yet from which he generates an otherworldly beauty. Let's take a look at this clip from his song A.R.T. All Rendered Truth. ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDh_GyrMU4A ). CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 81 What is it like to be a Lonnie Holley? What would it feel like to be this open and undefended? This trusting? This fearless? What compels all of these qualities? When I feel for an answer, one word comes to mind - Wonder. A captivating, consuming, compelling wondrous being with life. Wonder, we will see is an extension beyond interest into the realm of magical freshness. It is the ultimate motivator, and, amazingly, ever present and easily accessible when we are willing to open to it. At this point I offer an exercise that James Baraz used in a talk. You allow your mou th to open and look up as if in awe. The forcefulness and ease of doing this is incredible. We have a few brief comments about this practice and a short Q&A if there are questions. Wonder is always there. It is part of who we are. It's access point is fre shness. When we open to life in it's immediacy everything becomes wondrous. Ryokan captured this beautifully in his lines: What can ever be lost? What can be attained? If we attain something, it was there from the beginning of time. If we lose something, it -is hiding somewhere near us. Look: this ball in my pocket: can you see how priceless it is? We don't attain wonder, we open to it. It has been there since the beginning of time. And when we appreciate the freshness of beingness, we allow wonder to blo ssom in our heart and the ball in our pocket becomes priceless. Every moment is a totally fresh manifestation from the core of the universe no matter how mundane it might appear. Wonder can never be lost, it is sitting right by our side. People like Lonnie Holley live this. We can too. Sitting: Feeling Ordinary Freshness and Wonder 3:00 In this guided meditation, the breath is used as a vehicle of freshness to access wonder. We regulate the breathing at intervals for several minutes giving the yogis a sense of what it would be like to lose the breath. We feel clearly it's urgency and it's life. Our life. Fresh in every moment necessary and mysterious. What a wonder. What do we feel when we feel wonder? Next we do the Joseph Goldstein breath exercise with an emphasis on feeling the sensations of wonder as it unfolds. Imagine you are being born. You come out the chute and draw deeply your very first breath. Can you be with that? Drop into the feeling. Now imagine you have lived a full life and are on yo ur deathbed. Somehow you know this will be your very last breath. Can you be with that? Feel it. And the next? Feel it. And the next? Feel it. What a wonder filled way to sustain our practice. What do you feel as this unfolds? We stay with the breath for the sit exploring it's subtleties and freshness as if we were discovering breathing as a wondrous new part of life. We see if opening to the wonder helps to sustain our connection to the breath. Yogis can also do the upward gazing and CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 82 mouth open exercise w ith their eyes closed if that helps them connect with the feeling of wonder. Break 3:30 Talk/Q&A: Wonder to Continuity of Liberation 3:45 This section begins with a Q&A about the experience of wonder from the last sitting. Were people able to connect with it? Do you resonate with the idea of wonder? How was the breath regulation? Joseph's exercise? How was the mouth open upward gazing exercise while sitting? What doubts might folks have about sustaining wonder or their capacity to open to it, or whether it is an innate part of their beingness.? Every tradition from Vipassana to devotion to Advaita to Christian mysticism to... emphasizes continuity of hereness or isness to end suffering and inhabit freedom. It is a basic necessity of any p ath. We do not overcome wanting/neurotic movement thru willpower, we do so because we have tasted peace and know it to be the highest happiness. There are extreme sports such as skiing off of vertical cliffs that are wildly exciting. Wow. We, however, are becoming afficianados of extreme peace. Wow squared. We are ultimately motivated by a force beyond the mirage of individuality to realize our true nature. The fuel of this journey is our natural ability to connect with the innate wonder of our beingness. I remember being on my first month- long retreat at Spirit Rock. One afternoon after a lovely, connected sitting, I got up to walk to the food hall and every step was if I'd never walked before. I arrived at the food line and marveled at the extraordinarine ss of eating. I was going to take lumps of matter and stuff them into my head and if I didn't do that regularly, I'd die. I was almost overwhelmed with the absurdity of it. What freshness fueled wonder. In devotion there is the idea of every moment being offered in a wondrous surrender to the magnificence of the guru. From the realm of Advaita, Nisargadata advised his students to imagine that every moment was a puja or ritual offering to the absolute. Ramana Maharshi admonished his followers to inquire \"Who am I?\" until they felt the magnificence of the \"Self' or pure consciousness and then to stay relentlessly focused on that through it's wondrous \"amness\". Ultimately, these are all just pointers to something that has to become clear to you at a felt an d embodied level. It is up to you to find your very own sense of wonder that will fixate the attention in the present moment, awed by it's freshness and mystery. Sit: Feeling Clearly 4:10 You've had a very full day. At this point let the words and exercises fall away. Their impact has been made. In their wake, what is there? What mystery presents itself? Offer this sitting period to yourself as a gift. Mindful, alert and relaxed, allow it to unfurl CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 83 it's wondrous dance within you. Feeling clearly, you rest in your wholeness and your right to be in balance with life. Exercise to Music with Q&A: Feeling Clearly - Dancing As Life 4:40 Brief comments are invited and any questions. Answers will be short and participants will be asked to keep their queries short given the time of day. After about 10 minutes of discussion, I share comments about the dance form known as contact improvisation. This is when two or more people are in direct body contact often leaning on each other while moving in all manners from standing to rolling on the floor to everything in between. It is a remarkable experience. Every moment is fresh and unrehearsed yet requiring the most complete present attention. You cannot predict how your partner will move but must remain engag ed in a field of openness, allowing the dance to blossom not through you, but as you. You literally become the music, the movement, the contact, the flow. When there is a sense of individuality or separation or loss of focus the whole thing falls apart. Just so, contact improve can be done with a piece of music itself. You open to it fully and become it - dancing as life. The sense of music and you vanishes and there is a wholeness unfolding itself. Feeling clearly, wonder and innocence maintain the connection to the freedom of an already merged beingness. As this piece of music plays, allow your body to move without any fetters other than awareness of the space and non- harming. Or remain in stillness if that is the authentic expression that emerges. Whatever. Be free and one, feeling clearly and dancing as life. Then I play \"I'll Take You There\" by the Staple Singers ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K9xgx6fA5E ) Close with Intention 5:00 TEACHER BIO: Bruce Pardoe has practiced Vipassana meditation for the past ten years with numerous 1, 2 & 3 month retreats at Insight Meditation Society and Spirit Rock where he is currently enrolled in the 2 year Community Dharma Leader program. In ad dition, he has been on pilgrimage and practiced in Asia, and sat numerous extended solo retreats. Bruce expresses his wonder for awakening and dharma in direct, joyous and experiential teachings. His focus on sensorial feeling to convey wisdom derives from his years of Feldenkrais Awareness Through Movement and Hakomi Body- Centered Psychotherapy experience. He also draws extensively upon his deep experience with both Advaita and the path of devotion to complement and enrich his offerings.

Since this is a half daylong rather than a full daylong, the dharma talk portions will be short or compressed to make sure to leave plenty of time for practice. Each element of the schedule could be expanded for a full daylong on the same topic. Beginners will be welcome at this event. As a result, this will be a general Vipassana half daylong, and I wanted to focus on cultivating awareness and compassion rather than on conveying a lot of technical dharma. Here is the description I will provide: Setting aside time for intensive mindfulness practice allows the teachings to suffuse our lives and to deeply transform us. It creates the conditions for the awakening of w isdom and compassion in our hearts. During this half daylong, we will focus on letting go into the present moment with loving awareness, touching on each of the four foundations of mindfulness taught by the Buddha. Together, we will cultivate a clear, loving mindful presence that we can take into our daily lives. The day will be held in silence and instructions will be provided throughout. This event is appropriate for anyone who is interested. No experience is necessary. No one will be turned away for lack of funds. RETREAT SCHEDULE 10:00 to 10:30 Introduction of myself and topic 10:30 to 11:00 Sitting with guidance 11:00 to 11:15 Question and Answer Period 11:15 to 11:40 Dharma Talk 11:40 to 12:00 Break/time for snacks and refreshments 12:00 to 12:40 Sitting with Guidance 12:40 to 1:10 Question and Answer session and Dharma Talk 1:10 to 1:50 Sitting with Guidance 1:50 to 2:00 Closing, Dedication of Merit, Dana Talk DHARMA CONTENT 10:00 to 10:30 Talk & 10:30 to 11:00 Sitting: CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 86 During t he period in which I introduce the daylong topic, I will explain that the Buddha taught that we can create the conditions for liberation from suffering and that one of these conditions is cultivating an attitude of letting go of clinging in our daily lives and in our meditation practice. I will briefly discuss the mind's habit of clinging to the pleasant, pushing away the unpleasant, and being unaware of the neutral (vedana). I will also briefly touch on the hindrances, emphasizing greed and aversion as our responses to unpleasant and pleasant vedana. I will explain that mindfulness itself involves letting go into awareness of present experience and dropping the mind's habit of reacting with greed, hatred, or delusion. I will explain that by letting go of habitual reactions, we are able to see deeply what causes suffering and what leads to the cessation of suffering in any given moment. Also, when such habitual reactions or hindrances are occurring, we respond with compassion, noticing them as the obje ct of our awareness so that we let go of reaction to the reactivity and understand the suffering that occurs in a state of reactivity. The first sitting meditation instructions will focus on this theme of letting go of our habitual responses to the ever- changing phenomena that arise in our experience. 11:15 to 11:40 and Sitting 12:00 to 12:40 During the second dharma talk period, I will focus on letting go of viewing our experience through a conceptual lens, rather than directly in its true nature. Letti ng go of concepts about our experience allows for intimacy with and compassion towards our experience. I will explain that it is helpful to start with mindfulness of the body in developing non- conceptual meditative awareness, because the mind itself creat es concepts. I will briefly discuss the four elements, and the sitting guidance will focus on awareness of the four elements. 12:40 to 1:10 Talk & 1:10 to 1:50 Sitting: During the final talk before the final sitting, I will discuss how to cultivate non- conceptual, compassionate awareness of thoughts and emotions. I will discuss various approaches for letting go when being mindful of the mind: noticing a story line when it has taken over our thought processes and dropping it; letting go of judgments of o ur thoughts and emotions; letting go of fear of strong emotions and developing the courage and compassion to be present with them, in part by noticing how emotions manifest in the body; noticing the tone and texture of emotional reactions rather than seein g them through concepts. The sitting instructions for this portion of the daylong will focus on mindfulness of thoughts and emotions. BIO Tara Mulay has been practicing insight meditation and lovingkindness since 2003.

Williams PROGRAM TITLE: \"Making Your Whole Life the Zone\" DAYLONG DESCRIPTION WITH TOPIC Are you an athlete who practices meditation? Do you want to improve your mental performance? This workshop provides an opportunity to explore how mindfulness can increase your performance and ability to make your whole life the zone. The way that we approach our daily lives is interconnected with our play on the court, on the track or on the field. We will explore ways to integrate mindfulness into our lives to increase our ability to be in \"the zone.\" In particular we will examine three aspects of the eightfold path: wise speech, wise effort and mindfulness. This daylong will include sitting mediation practice as well as Augusto Boal's transformative movement practices. We will also engage in small group discussions and sharing. This workshop is geared towards current and former athletes, sports lovers, and people who are interested in cultivating mindfulness into their daily practice.

Karen 2:15 - 3:00 (this may vary depending on the size of the group) Movement Transformation. This exercise is adapted from Augusto Boal. Introduce Augusto Boal. Form a circle. Participants are encouraged to perform a movement that represents their sport or a type of activity. For example a jump shot or kicking a ball. The person repeats the movement and shares X while repeating the movement. The person takes that movement to another person in the circle and transfers it. The next person picks up the movement and transforms it into a movement that represents their sport/play and answers the question. This continues until everyone has participated. If there are people with movement limitations, people can bring a chair to the circle and the person can perform the movement from the chair and select someone to transfer the movement to.

Williams is a peer leader at NYInsight and a participant in the Community Dharma Leaders training program. She has practiced vipassana med itation since 2008 and regularly leads the NYInsight Brooklyn sangha sit. Karen is a long time athlete of volleyball and track and field. When Karen is not teaching at Queens College, she can be found playing roller derby with Gotham Girls Roller Derby League. She plays under the name \"BackAlley Dred.\" This is her fourth season on the track and her first season as captain of the Grand Central Terminators and co-captain of the Bronx Gridlock. Karen's practice is rooted in cultivating a spirit of whole heartedness on and off the track. In addition to her love of sports and athleticism, she received her doctoral degree in cultural anthropology from the CUNY Graduate Center. Her research CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 92 examines strategies implemented inside correctional facilities to help inca rcerated people return home to their communities. SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD BRING PEOPLE INTO THE EVENT, I.E. AN OUTREACH PLAN This event would be held in March 2017 or September 2017. I expect there to be 20-25 people at this event. I would use social media outlets and my current connections in the roller derby community to find participants. Within the derby community there are people who play other sports and/or are connected with other sports such as hockey, ice-skating, baseball, etc. I would reach out to those networks too. This workshop could easily incorporate a co-facilitator. If so, I would make sure that the co - facilitator was also grounded in the dharma and athletic community. The co -facilitator would use their networks to bring people to the workshop. Although this workshop is focused on athletes and how they can make their whole lives the zone , you do not have to be a current athlete to benefit from the daylong. The ideas and practices can be applied to non-athletes as well or people who are familiar with sports or other types of bodily/movement practices, e.g. yoga, Pilates, weight lifting, etc. Therefore, the hosting organization would also reach out to their communities to garner interest. I could also reach out to local colleges and universities with athletic programs, yoga centers, local sports shops and amateur sports clubs, e.g. runners, bikers, triathletes. As far as the actual images for flyers, web blasts, etc., it is important that the literature is diverse in terms who is represented and what sports are represented. Lastly, I would do a trial version of this in the roller derby community (and with other athletes who do not regularly practice meditation) with about 12 skaters. I could get some feedback on what worked for them and what they might want to see integrated and talked about.

(5) Outreach: This daylong program is designed to be an exploration of how the D harma can be taken off the cushion and integrated more into our daily lives. It's appropriate for all, but I think especially for folks newer to the Dharma. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 95 1 Day Mindfulness in Nature Retreat DRAFT Mary Haberman In this retreat we will use our senses to open our awareness to the natural world. The retreat will include simple instructions in mindfulness meditation practices and will be highly experiential, with as we practice being fully present outside in nature. Beginners and experienced meditators are welcome. We will be outside for most of the day, so please bring appropriate clothing. (If it's an extremely rainy day, we'll go to Plan B with some inside or sheltered breaks.) Schedule: 8:30-9 Register and get settled. 9-10:30 Introduction: Why nature? (15 minutes) Intro the day's schedule and noble silence. Introduction of the teachers and students. Introduction of mindfulness meditation and a short meditation (15 mins) Introduction to using our senses and dealing with people we will come across while out Logistics: Where we will go and how we are walking or carpooling there. Pass out maps. Questions? 10:30-11 Getting to location. Snack? 11-11:30 Meditation on Seeing (First 5 or so minutes with instruction.) After each new meditation, open it up for a few share outs of experiences or questions before the next, so it's really about 20 minutes of meditation. Standing, sitting or walking is ok. 11:30-12 Meditation on Hearing. 12-12:30 Meditation on Feeling. 12:30- 1:30 Lunch with eating meditation instructions prior and opportunity for a few questions. 1:30 to 2 Questions and Answers. 2-2:30 Pair up and take turns voicing what one notices or is aware of with all senses internally or externally as one walks in nature (seeing, hear ing, feeling, smelling) 2:30-3 Individual meditation that's open to any sense -- or participants can pick a segment to focus awareness on one sense and then switch it up to another. And add in: attitude (vedana) about what's observed: pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. 3-315 Sharing, Questions 3:15-3:45 Pair up and do short walks and take turns voicing what one observes that is pleasant. Letting go of the unpleasant. 3:45-4. Final share outs and wrap up. 4-4:30 Get back to the hall if necessary. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 96 Purposes: To provide opportunities to expand mindfulness to off-the -cushion life. To draw potential new participants. Nature and outdoor activities are popular in our community. Combining that inclination to appreciate nature with mindfulness seems like a natural fit. Anticipated Participants: Some regular members of our meditation community and some new people. Maybe some who are older and not as mobile -- so a consideration for where we go and possibly we'd need to describe the activities so people c ould self select. This probably depends on where we end up doing the retreat. Dharma Content: Mindfulness of the Body and Vedana. Teacher Qualifications/ Short Bio: Still working on this. In addition to meditation experience, I have outdoor leadership e xperience and teaching experience to possibly include. Teacher Compensation: Small fee to our sangha, and maybe also to the teacher, or by donation. (I would like it to be affordable. And it might be generate some money toward CDL expenses too.) Location ideas: Start at our local Dharma Hall. Either walk to nature trails nearby or drive. We'd need a rainy day alternative so we can be in nature with some shelter perhaps or take shelter interspersed with walks out in nature. Another option might be the c ommunity college through Community Education program. In that case this retreat would be a class with a small fee. The college has grounds that would be relatively empty on a weekend day. It would be more accessible. But it doesn't really have trails -- more sidewalks. Promotion: Within our sangha we have a built in potential base. For our weekend retreats we usually make flyers and distribute them in a few locales. We announce it face to face at our regular sits, have flyers in the entryway, put it on the website, and send it out over the listserv. If it were through the Community College it would be promoted by them. We could also link up with other meditation groups and MBSR teacher in down. We could promote it at local outdoor stores, through County Parks and Rec, the local environmental newspaper, the alternative weekly paper, facebook, hiking and climbing clubs, university outdoor center, university radio and flyers/posters at the university and community college.

She is a practice leader at the Mariposa Sangha and has taught introductory meditation classes since 2011. Currently she is in the Community Dharma Leader program at Spirit Rock Meditation Center. Daylong Description Investigation is one of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. We often hear about investigation, yet how do we apply this to our practice? How can we investigate without churning up thought and abstraction? How can we use investigation to deepen our practice? During this daylong meditation together, we'll explore what investigation looks like in our own practice. Schedule: 9-9:20. Introduction to topic and structure of daylong.

CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 98 \"Retreat in a Box\" Program offered by Ja n Rosamond Description: \"Retreat in a Box\" is a daylong event that I have offered in St. Louis several times since October 2015. They have been very well attended. (We are always \"sold out\" within a few days of announcing the event.) Although there are two Insight Sitting Groups in St. Louis, there is no established teacher closer than 500 miles and very few out -of-town teachers come to the area. I created this program to try to offer a retreat- like experience with nationally recognized teachers for practitioners in the St. Louis area, most of whom would not otherwise be able to attend such an event. I call the program \"Retreat in a Box\" because it uses existing \"pre -packaged\" daylong retreats videotaped at Spirit Rock and made available to members of the Stewardship Circle (of which I am one). NOTE: I asked for and was granted permission by Spirit Rock to offer this program. Schedule: These \"Box Retreats\" are held on a Sunday, starting at 9:00 am and continuing to 4:00 pm. I use the internet and a large -screen TV to stream one of Spirit Rock's videotaped daylong \"retreats\" exactly as it was recorded, start to finish. (For example: Jack Kornfield's \"Introduction to \"Daylong for Care Providers\".) We keep silence the entire day, including lunch and other breaks. Attendees bring a bag lunch. Tea is provided. I start with a brief introduction and an overview of the day, including an explanation of how it is that I am able to offer the \"retre at\". Since the group is small (less than 20), I also ask everyone to introduce themselves. At the end of the day, I close with the sharing of merit (unless the recording already includes this) and open the floor for discussion, comments and questions. I also ask for dana, explaining that 100% will be sent to Spirit Rock. Number of Attendees: Because these events are held in a private home (where there is internet access and a basement room with a large -screen TV), the maximum number that can be accommodated is 18. Dates: I have held these \"Box Retreats\" in October 2015, January 2016 and April 2016. The next one will be July 2016. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 99 Venue: We meet at the home of one of the members of our Sitting Group. Because this is a pre-recorded event available thro ugh Spirit Rock's website, internet access and a large - screen TV is required. Compensation: These daylong \"retreats\" are held on a dana basis. 100% goes to Spirit Rock. Program Leader (Jan Rosamond): I am one of Spirit Rock's Stewardship Circle members (which is how I have access to these taped daylong events.) I am a graduate of DPP4 and have practiced since 1998. I have sat more than 300 nights of retreat, including 6 weeks at IMS, 1 month at Dharmagiri (S. Africa), and 1 month at Spirit Rock. Why This Program: Most practitioners in St. Louis have had very little retreat practice and very, very few have had the opportunity to attend an event led by teachers such as Jack Kornfield, Sharon Salzberg, Phillip Moffitt, etc. We do have the opportunity to \"attend\" these Spirit Rock webcasts individually, but that doesn't provide the retreat- like experience of sitting with other practitioners. Also, very few in St. Louis are aware of these webcasts. Outreach: I announce these \"Retreat in a Box\" events on my website: dharmatown.org. I also send an email invitation to a mailing list I have accumulated of approximately 120 names. And I talk about these events at the Sitting Group and the KM group I co -lead. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 100 Helen Vantine Program Proposal: Introduction to Mindfulness The program is a daylong retreat that begins at 10:00 and ends at 4:00. See the outline of the day's scheduled events. This retreat might have 30 attendees. To better facilitate question and answer periods, it is best with 15 -25 people or even less. Depending on the location it can be held any time of the year. Here in Atlanta the weather is mild enough even in the winter to allow for outdoor walking periods. Often on days where there is intermittent rain one can schedule an outdoor walk to coincide with a period when the rain has stopped. It is good to have a n eye on the weather and work with the schedule because this silent walking period is often the best part of the retreat for the participants. This type of retreat day can be held in a variety of venues. We often use a group shelter at a state park, but any venue that can hold 15 -30 people with extra room for yoga will do. It is best if there is an outdoor area where people can walk in nature. I recently held a retrea t (like the one outlined) in the conference room at a Country Inn that had beautiful gardens and nature trails. This type of retreat is typically fee -based, but can be done with a suggested donation for the teachers instead of fees. An inexpensive venue , like a group shelter in a state park, is best for donation -only retreats. Teacher background for this retreat would be training in teaching Mindfulness -Based programs such as MBSR or MBCT, or by someone who is a long -term practitioner of Vipassana medi tation with some knowledge of Mindfulness -Based programs. I have presented this program and would be happy to present it again. Many people are interested in Meditation/Mindfulness and are looking for shorter programs that can serve as introductions to m editation. Participants who take a program like this often become interested in joining a meditation group or a Buddhist Sangha. Outline for a Day -Long Mindfulness Retreat This assumes that the retreat will begin at 10:00 and end at 4:00. I recommend that it be a day of silence, with cell phones and reading materials set aside until the retreat is over. Since there is a lunch break people can check in, but the ideal is no distractions. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 101 10:00 - Gathering and short guided meditation. 10:15 - Short discussion with introductions and maybe a question about their experience with meditation and their expectations for the day. Rules for safety: No comparing, no judging, no fixed ideas. 10:35 - Talk on what mindfulness is and what it isn't. Time for questions here. 10:50 - Body Scan meditation. (This is typically done lying down so we suggest people bring a blanket to the retreat.) 11:10 - Talk on the importance of mindfulness of the body for stress reduction/reactivity and being present. 11:20 - Instruction on Walking Meditation with some time to practice. (The practice is best done outside, but that depends on the weather.) 11:50 - Instructions on Mindful Eating using a raisin. 12:15 - Mindful LUNCH, followed by 30 minutes of walking in nature in silence. 1:15 - Guided mediation on the Breath. 1:35 - Talk on stress and the default mind plus questions and comments. 2:30 - Mindful movement (very gentle stretching/yoga/qi gong) 2:50 - Exercise on perception. 3:10 - Guided meditation on sounds with less guidance. 3:30 - Final discussion with questions and comments. 4:00 - End.

With periods of sitting meditation and walking meditation mixed in with talks and participation, we will explore as a group what it means to bring awareness to our experience in our bodies. The day will include guided meditation instructions, discussions on what it means to bring mindfulness to our experience, and space for questions and sharing. All are welcome at this daylong, regardless of previous meditation experience. Outreach I plan on this being an introductory daylong intended for people relatively new to meditation. I will be reaching out to places I have taught at, including mostly treatment cente rs and yoga studios. I will be leaving flyers at local meditation studios, yoga studios, treatment centers, coffee shops, and wellness studios. I also plan on utilizing social media, as my meditation site has 400,000 Facebook followers. I have a background in marketing, and will utilize images online, sharing my posts, creating event pages, and encouraging friends/followers to share the event. When I do a daylong, I hope to have a co-facilitator to help with the mindful movement portions, to help answer questions, and give some new perspective. This will also be helpful in outreach, as I will have a co-teacher with a different base of followers. Also included in my outreach will be space for scholarships; I do not want anyone to be turned away for lack of funds.

CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 107 Emily Carpenter Daylong Description: Returning to Presence: A Mindfulness Meditation Daylong Retreat This daylong retreat will be an opportunity to explore a more extended period of mindfulness meditation practice. It will be held mostly in silence and will include periods of sitting and walking meditation, as well as talks about the meditation teachings and opportunities for Q&A. All are welcome.

Do a go around where people share their names and one other piece of info that's valuable to them/they'd like the community to know. Orientation to the daylong Guidelines for creating a safe/supportive community for practice: ask for group's input - what helps to create safety/a sense of support? Agree on a few guidelines. Introduce silence and a non-harming attitude towards each other and ourse lves. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 108 Establishing a wise attitude for formal practice - kindness, curiosity, beginner's mind, we only need to be present in this moment. Guided sit Arriving and settling, mindfulness of the body and breath, bringing a kind attitude to what we're meeting in our experience, practicing beginning again. Walking instructions and walking practice bringing mindfulness to movement (we spend much of lives moving), in walking meditation, we're not going for a walk. Not walking to get anywhere. Bringing mindfulnes s to the sensations of feet and legs, sense of the whole body moving. Talk about speed of walking, pausing at the end of our path, feeling the body turn... Guided sit Grounding in the body, turning attention to the breath, experimenting with finding the appropriate container to explore the experience of breathing (not too narrow a focus so we get tight, not too wide so we space out). Continuing to develop a non -judgmental attitude - if you notice you're mind has wandered, gently coming back. Ending with a few minutes of metta for oneself. Dhamma reflection - Mindfulness of the Body Why/how we practice it and how it supports us (these are just rough notes) As a culture, we're pretty disconnected from our bodies - we tend to live in our heads, some of us have experienced trauma that makes our bodies feel unsafe. How mindfulness of the body helps: b rings us into the present moment, our bodies are always in the present, which is where o ur lives are happening. C an't have yesterday's headache or tomorrow's pleasant sensation. Helps us stay grounded, instead of being drawn out by every stimuli that comes our way. We often have a lot competing for our attention. Keeping some of our mindfulness in the body, gives us a choice in where we want to direct our attention. We can learn about our state of mind by paying attention to our body. Mindfulness of the body helps us create a more balanced attitude in relation to the body, not based on hatred of it or a fascination with its beauty and perfection or that of the bodies of other people. We c an explore some of the deepest meditation teachings through mindfulness of the body - that our bodies aren't ultimately under our control, they aren't ours. Q&A/discussion Walking Invitation to return to the simplicity of the walking, letting go any of the CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 109 conversation/questions, just being with our moment to moment experience as it arises. Silent sitting Lunch Give an orientation to mindful eating at the beginning of lunch. Do a mindful eating exercise: eating a raisin with mindfulness. Reminder about continuity of mindfulness - practicing in all postures, whatever we're doing. Vipassana out loud practice Create dyads (give everyone the option to sit this out if they want to), give a short orientation to vedana, then alternate each person reporting out loud about unpleasant experiences that they're having (could be just body or other experiences too), switch, then have each person report out loud the pleasant experiences they're having. Have group share about how the experience was for them. Guided sit Settling after the interactive exercise, noticing how you feel after it awareness to breath and body, then shifting to awareness of moods and thoughts Walking Guided yoga practice Bringing some energy to the body at a p oint in the afternoon when it might be getting dull/fatigued Bringing interest to the movements, no need to get anywhere, see if you can give everyone in the community the space to do their own practice, no competition Silent sit Dhamma reflection Potpou rri talk: Buddha's teaching of ehi passiko - come and see for yourself - not taking the teaching on someone else's word, really putting the teachings to practice in our own lives to see if they make sense/help us live with more ease. Trusting ourselves and having patience - opening to our own experience, both the easy and the difficult, meeting our edges and beginning to expand beyond them isn't something that we do right away. It makes patience and commitment. Stay in touch with your own goodness - recollect it regularly. Find/create a safe and supportive community to practice with. Q&A/discussion Creating space for people who haven't yet spoken to make comments/ask questions CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 110 Walking Simple guided metta sit metta for self using phrases metta and appreciation for the group, the grounds, the other beings on the land dedication of merit Closing Appreciating everyone's practice Recommendations for going home: giving yourself whatever space you can, remembering self kindness, though the external conditions will have changed, we can still practice mindfulness. Talk about ways to stay connected Invite any comments/questions/feedback Bio Emily Carpenter has been practicing lovingkindness and Insight Meditation since 1998 and is interested in exploring the med itation teachings both in the context of our daily lives and in our communities, as well as in retreat settings. She has an MSW and works in the nonprofit field in Austin. She also spends periods in silent retreat each year at the Insight Medi tation Societ y in Massachusetts. Outreach P lan Announce it at other sangha events (ie, our weekly sitting group, other sangha retreats) Do a few boosted posts on Facebook (so as to reach not only the sangha's Facebook followers, but also their friends) Send out a coup le of emails about it to the sangha mailing list Post flyers at various venues around town (yoga studios, community centers, other meditation centers) CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 111 Grace Fisher Women, Wisdom and Meditation 1. Description: \"Our bodies know that they belong, it is our minds that make our lives so homeless.\" - John O'Donohue So much of our suffering can come from a feeling of disconnection and separation\u2014 from ourselves and from the people and world around us. For many of us, this suffering is fueled by the storie s we tell ourselves about our lives. This daylong is an invitation for women to come together to practice in community and begin to relax the hold of some of these stories. By quieting the mind and opening the heart, we can touch into our innate feminine w isdom and sense the truth of our deep belonging to the world. This day will offer periods of sitting and walking meditation, drawing from both insight and heart meditation practices. There will also be teachings, guided meditations, and time for focused d iscussions. New and experienced meditators who self identify as women are welcome. 2. 9:30-10:15: Introduction to the day, and sit 10:15 -10:45: Walk 10:45 -11:15: Sit 11:15 -12:15: Talk and discussion 12:15 -1:30: Lunch 1:30-2:00: Sit 2:00-2:30: Walk 2:30-3:15: Sit 3:15-4:15:Talk and Discussion 4:15: 4: 30: Short Sit & Closing 3. 30 -40 women 4.

Grace Fisher is the lead teacher for the Thursday women's group at Spirit Rock and has been part of the teaching team for almost a decade. While living in Colorado, she led a weekly women's meditation group and several half day programs for women. She is also a psychotherapist in private practice and enjoys supporting women finding and then standing in their truth. 8. I feel that is it vital for women to have a forum to come together and practice; to be together in silence and in council. My hope that this daylong will offer women the opportunity to come together in a reasonabl y intimate setting to share the teachings and our collective wisdom. I also hope that women will come away from our time together with a deeper sense of connection to themselves, their guiding, heart wisdom, and a sense of greater belonging in the world. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 112 Justin Michelson 1) Daylong description. This day-long retreat is an optional culminating experience, positioned at the end of a 6 week introductory course (overview of 6 -week course attached at bottom ). The intent is to primarily to provide a space for beginning practitioners to synthesize the themes, theory, and personal practice of the previous 6 weeks - to allow them to deepen the roots of their growing wisdom and compassion, and plant strong intentions for their future practice. Hence, the concepts offered will be a weave of the previous six weekly themes (Four Noble Truths and Four Foundations), referencing key teachings we've already been working with. 2. Retreat Schedule: 8:30am: soft start time, settle in. 8:45am: Introduction to the day/logistic s 9:00am: 1st sitting - Guided meditation on \"setting of the intention\" and 1st Foundation of mindfulness (breathing). 9:45am: Introduction to walking meditation - indoor, guided for the first 10 minutes on theme of 1st Foundation. 10:15am: 2nd sitting - guided meditation on the 2nd Foundation - \"exploring our bodies\" 11:00am: 2nd walking meditation - guided with 2nd Foundation theme for the first 10 minutes. 11:30am: Dharma Talk - an overview of the first 3 noble truths + Question and Answer 12:15pm: Lunch Break (bring your own) 1:30pm: 3rd sitting - guided meditation on the 3rd Foundation 2:15pm: Guided Qi -Gong Movement - guided with 3rd Foundation theme for the first 10 minutes 2:45pm: 4th sitting meditation - guided meditation on the 4th Founda tion 3:30pm: 4th walking meditation - guided with 4th Foundation theme for the first 10 minutes 4:00pm: Dharma Talk - Overview of the Four Foundations + the Fourth Noble Truth. 4:45pm: Question/Answer + closing thoughts. 5:00pm: Departure 3. Outline of the Dharma Content. The previous six weeks was an experiential overview of the Four Noble Truths (1st week) and the Four Foundations of Mindfulness (the next five weeks). However, those two teachings are interpreted and offered from my particular style and approach to meditation. In the 6 -week course overview attached below, you can see my conceptualize of what I see as essential themes, in a progressive order, ending with this day-long immersion experience. The course and day-long contents are not secular, but they will be paired with modern studies about mindfulness and neuroscience to make it accessible and relevant to the participants. The day will mirror the previous weeks. We will open with setting our intention; then, each of the following meditations will be themed with the Four Foundations of Mindfulness - guided for the first 5-10 minutes of each sit and walk. There will be a Dharma talk and Q&A at the end of the morning, as well as at the end of the afternoon. 4. Short Bio. Justin Michelson began practicing meditation in 2000 in Seattle, WA, under the guidance of Rodney Smith. Over the past 15 years, his practice has led him CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 113 on travels through numerous meditation groups, retreat centers, and inspiring teachers and teachings. Regular meditation practice has been a cornerstone of his personal growth and maturation, offering countless opportunities for insight and a gradual deepening in inner peace. He is now part of a two and half year teacher training program, led by Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Woodacre, CA. 5. Outreach Plan. I have attempted to run this six week course once in the past year, without enough sign ups. So, getting more skilled at outreach is particularly important for me. Previously, I advertised it on a small MeetUp group, on my personal Facebook page, at a regular dance event in town of like -minded folks, and put flyers up all over Eugene. I got a handful of interested people, but no one actually followed through and came to the first course, which was disappointi ng. Looking into the future, I could start advertising earlier, talk it up more in person with my network, and increase the number of flyers (also the MeetUp contact list has grown). However, I'm beginning to share the Dharma occasionally at an Insight g roup in Eugene, and I hope that through this group I can attract some people to this introductory course, as well. In addition, for the next time I try it (sometime this year), I will use a more central location to host it in Eugene, and will spend more t ime advertising around the University of Oregon campus. ________________________________________ ______________________________ An introduction to Insight Meditation A 6-Week Series ~ Tuesdays, 4-5:30pm October 20th - November 24th grow in wisdom ~ awaken compassion ~ explore your truth Week 1: The Meditative Journey : an overview of the history, the practice and the path.

Being in nature, an antidote to autopilot, can effortlessly bring us into the present moment to feel connected and alive. Mindfulness in Nature is a MBSR style retreat with guided meditations offered in noble silence in the misty woods and open meadows of the Stony Brook-Millstone Watershed. We will explore how meditation is supported by the stillness of nature and how, in turn, practicing in nature organically opens the heart and awakens states of wellbeing and insight. Experiencing the power of being present, we will reflect on the truths of impermanence and inter -connection with in ourselves and the world around us. Schedule: 10-10:25 Welcome 10:25-10:50 Transitional Meditation : Invitation to be present to what's arising 10:50 - 12:00 Body Scan and Mindfulness in Motion 12:00 - 12:30 Reflection on impermanence and inter -connection with in ourselves and the world around us 12:30 - 1:10 Intro to mindful eating and Lunch (outside) 1:10 - 1:40 Standing Yoga 1:40 - 2:10 Mountain Meditation (outside) 2:10 - 2:30 Walking Meditation (outside) 2:30 - 3:00 Sitting Meditation 3:00 - 3:25 Loving Kindness Meditation (reflection on connection) 3:-25 - 3:45 Breaking silence ritual 3:45 - 4:30 Open discussion and close with Metta Attendance: 10-30 people Date: June 2016 Location: Stony Brook - Millstone Watershed, Pennington, NJ This program is s ponsored by Trinity Counseling Center, a nonprofit agency where no one is turned away for inability to pay. This r etreat is offered on a sliding scale basis and teachers are paid by Trinity Counseling Center. Presented by Robin Boudette with guest teache r Robin Boudette has been a student of yoga and meditation for more then 15 years. She has studied Vipassana meditation, completed three yoga teacher trainings and is a certified Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction Instructor. Additionally, completed a do ctoral dissertation on the therapeutic effects of Outward Bound. Nature has always been a refuge for me, a place where qualities of mindfulness- presence, stillness, acceptance, spaciousness, - arise without effort. I would like to offer this experience to others who might be getting stuck. I can get bogged down myself by the content in MBSR. In nature, the content falls away. \"Being\" is transmitted by the surroundings rather then in words. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 116 Augusta Hopkins PROPOSAL for Day of Cultivating Mindfulne ss of Emotions 1. Please describe the program, including its content, theme, and purpose. This daylong program is designed to help us embrace our suffering more deeply. We will relieve suffering by exploring emotions . Have you been accused of not having e motions? Are you accused of being too emotional? Are you unaware of your emotions? Are you ruled by your emotions? Befriending our emotions can help all of use, whichever side of the scale we find ourselves. For some of us, befriending buried emotions can help us find ourselves more fully. For others learning to care for our emotions can help us feel more stability. 2. Please give a schedule of the day's events with amount of time allotted for various activities, including meditation periods. Daylong ( Day of Mindfulness) will run from 10am - 5pm 10am - 11am: Arrival, introductions, deep listening and sharing from the heart, inspirations and aspirations for the day, do you identify as someone with strong emotions? or someone who would enjoy having grea ter access to their emotions? 11am - 1pm: Sitting meditation - to STOP, calm, arrive and settle Mindful movements - feeling into our bodies Body scan - exploring the sensations more deeply 1pm - 2pm: lunch, mindful meal, fully experiencing each bite - heightening our awareness and sensations of eating. 2pm - 3pm: Walking meditation - 30 min Sitting meditation - 30 min 3pm - 4pm: Offering children's book Visiting Feelings, R.A.I.N., Pain x Resistance Suffering, Pema Chodron on Karuna, Mudita.

How many people might reasonably be ant icipated to attend? Twenty (20) 4. In what month and year do you propose the program occur (or start)? June 12, 2016 5. What would be the program's venue? (Example: Community Hall, church, library, home, office, etc) Yoga studio 6. How would the teacher(s ) be compensated for leading the program (Example: \"Dana\" or fee- based) Dana for the teacher. Registration fee of $25 per person will go to the venue 7. What background and experience prepares the teacher to lead or teach the program? Augusta is a student of Thich Nhat Hanh and Insight Meditation. She brings these traditions together in a way that has been called \"Zen with an edge.\" She is a Philadelphia Native and tells it like it is. Though her values are more aligned with San Francisco, which she has called home for more than fifteen years. 8. Why do you want to present this program? Emotions have ruled my life. I grew up the child of an actively drinking mother and a manic depressive father. Again and again, I received the message that my strong emotions (if there were at all sad) were not OK. Today I practice being with my emotions, fear, grief, anger in a way that allows them to fully express themselves without overwhelming me. It is hard, every growing work, and I want to share it with others. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 118 Allison Shore \"Sitting\" with Chronic Pain: A Daylong for People Can't Meditate Because of Pain* 10am -4:15pm *The title as well as much of this curriculum is adapted from /inspired by the teachings of Darlene Cohen an d Beata Chapman. Please do not use these materials without permission. Description For those of us living with chronic pain, illness, and/or disability, images of young, beautiful people sitting perfectly cross -legged on cushions can create an unwelcoming invitation to learn to meditate. And yet mindfulness meditation practice can be one of the most powerful tools in the toolbox for coping with and even thriving while inhabiting painful bodies. During this daylong, we will learn about the relationship between pain and suffering, explore alternative ways to \"sit\" and meditate, and investigate ways to use mindfulness to skillfully manage chronic pain. The day will include guided and silent meditation, gentle movement practice, small and large group discussions, and short dharma talks. Please come as you are - every body is welcome. Note: This daylong is intended for people living with pain rather than as a professional training experience for those wanting to teach to this population.

My intention is to present this series in a way that people from all traditions can benefit from these practices. I am also intending to invite the participants and graduates from my secular based mindfulness programs, who are looking for a ways to deepen their practice. 1. The essence of Loving Kindness: cultivation of friendliness and good will toward all beings, including oneself. Reference: my mentor DaeJa Napier's teaching and guidance & Visuddhimagga - characteristic, function, proximal cause, near and far enemies of Loving Kindness. 2. How is Loving Kindness present in every moment of mindfulness? How does the mind relate to what is happening? 3. The meaning of the Loving Kindness phrases. Reference: my mentor DaeJa Napier's teachings and guidance & Loving Kindness by Sharon Salzberg 4. Why it is recommended to start the practice with oneself? If it is difficult, how to work with that? Reference: Rajan Sutta: The King (Ud 5.1) & Visuddhimagga \"Searching all directions with your awareness, you find no one dearer than yourself. In the same way, others are thickly dear to themselves. So you shouldn't hurt others if you love yourself.\" CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 122 5. Questions to reflect on and share in the groups of three: - From your personal experience, what obscures loving kindness and goodwill? - What aspect of another person can you consider that would incline you to feel friendlier toward t hem? - Which points of view, reflections, or attitudes would help you to have more loving kindness toward others? 4 th Component: Bio Janka Livoncova has been practicing meditation and yoga since 1994 and teaching since 2004.

CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 123 Andrew Chaikin MMM! Mindfulness, Movement and Music OVERVIEW MMM! is a daylong program that integrates formal meditation with creative, somatic expression \u2014 improvisation of the body and voice \u2014 all in the aliveness of nature. As the day unfolds, students progress from stillness to movement; from silence to expression; from individual to communal; from self to beyond-self to not-self; from suffering to joy and liberation. Morning: Situated outdoors in a circle of trees, students will spend the morning in stillness \u2014 guided in traditional formal meditations: mindfulness of body and breath, and the Five Elements. We will explore the experience of the body as nature, the confluence of natural forces \u2014 solidity, flow, expansion / contraction, transformation, and emptiness. Lunch: These inquiries will flow into instruction on mindful eating, as the students integrate their formal practice into the physical and emotional experience of eating a simple lunch in the outdoors. Afternoon: We will first explore mindful, improvisational movement. Students will be guided through subtle, non-verbal prompts to move in their own unique way \u2014 playing, exploring and engaging in a dialogue with the natural landscape around them. In this way, we carry the themes of the morning's sitting practice \u2014 mindfulness of the body and mind, natural forces and energies, attention to sound and sensation \u2014 into movement practice. As the body awakens, students will then open their voices \u2014 first as individuals, playing with the sounds of nature around them. Gradually, they will be guided to come CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 124 together in circle-song, playing with rhythm, vibration and harmony \u2014 becoming a connected circle of heartful, joyful expression in nature. SCHEDULE 9:30 Arrival / Registration. 10:00 Opening Circle. Overview, introductions. 10:30 Meditation: Mindfulness of Body and Breath. 11:00 Discussion / Q+A. 11:15 Meditation: The Five Elements. 12:00 Discussion / Q+A / Bio-break. 12:15 Instruction: Mindful Eating. 12:30 Lunch. 1:30 Mindful Movement in Nature. 2:15 Vocal Play / Circle-Singing. 3:00 Meditation: Mindfulness of Body, Emotion, Vedana. 3:15 Bio-Break. 3:30 Closing Circle.

DHARMIC THEMES * Abiding, accepting, non-judgmental attention to the experience of body and heart-mind. * The body as nature, as confluence of natural forces / energies: Earth, Water, Air, Fire, Space \u2014 solidity, flow, expansion / contraction, transformation / evolution, emptiness. * Mental / emotional activity as nature, natural forces / energies. * The self as the aggregate of these somatic, mental and emotional experiences. Clinging to the self-story = the source of suffering. * Liberation from suffering via non-clinging to these aggregates. * Mindfulness of activities: eating, walking, speaking, movement, vocal play, etc. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 125 Mindfulness of vedana: feeling-tone as an aggregate and a source of suffering; mindfulness of vedana / non-clinging as a source of liberation. Cultivating joy \u2014 through liberated, mindful, improvisational expression of body and voice. Improvisation = non-attachment to outcome; letting go as a source of freedom and well-being. LOGISTICS Location: Spirit Rock Center, Woodacre CA, or Roberts Regional Park, Berkeley CA. The space will be sunny enough to stay warm throughout the day, shady enough to not be bombarded by sun. Class Size: Up to 25 students. Pricing: Suggested donation of $40-$60, with no one turned away for lack of funds. To Bring: Comfortable clothes and shoes for movement. Bag lunch and snack. Meditation cushion or towel. Hat. Sweatshirt or sweater. Water bottle. Sunblock. AUDIENCE The program is suitable for students at any level of practice. Ideally, the students would be a mixture of dharma / mindfulness practitioners and creative / somatic practitioners \u2014 singers, dancers, artists, poets, etc. This cross-pollination would allow all the students to learn new modalities, challenge themselves, and grow in new directions. OUTREACH PLAN I will promote the program to my existing mailing list of students via email; through social media (Twitter and Facebook); and possibly via printed flyers at various sanghas and conscious dance events in the Bay Area.

CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 127 Alice Robison A DAY LONG RETREAT: 9:00 am-5:00 pm (1) A daylong description with topic Anger. Aversion. Acrimony. It appears to be everywhere in the media and people are not afraid to express it, but is anyone listening? During this day long we will dive into what makes up anger, how we feel it, what to do with it, and how we can use Buddhist teachings to help navigate it. Another possibility: Love Your Enemies.

I feel counter anger is very wide spread for all victims of trauma. How can anger or hatred in the context of trauma be released in positive ways or healed? The idea of releasing or getting rid of anger is part of the Western idea that by releasing the energy the person will feel better and their life will be healthier. My approach is that it is not possible to get rid of energy and physics also teaches that we cannot create or destroy matter or energy. In traditional Native thought it is unthinkable to get rid of the anger, sickness, addiction and so on. What I ask patients to do is to make a conscious relationship with the anger. This requires that the patient introduce themselves to the anger and give it a gift. The gift in the Native American tradition usually is in the form of natural tobacco. Intent is more important than the actual form of the physical gift. The gift is a ceremonial form that allows our ego life to transcend and make relationship with spiritual entities. In Tibetan Buddhism it is also customary to give gifts to the Deities in the form of grain, butter lamps and such. Natural law dictates that the energy of anger must respond by introducing itself. Once the relationship has become conscious the person can ask anger what it is trying to teach them in this life time. Therefore, the anger becomes an ally that can help the person move into higher consciousness and not something to rid themselves of...especially since it is not possible to get rid of this energy. ~Ed Duran CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 129 Dalila Bothwell Program Title: Last Night a Brownie Saved My Life: Dharma, Food & You 1. After a particularly trying day sometimes it seems that brownie from the bakery down the street will make it all better. All the feelings will go away. Yet, our past experiences tell us that mindlessly eating our feelings in the form of a brownie won't save us. How can we remember all that we are and that these human feelings will come to pass without numbing out on food? During this daylong retreat we will explore through the three marks of existence: impermanence (everything changes - even our feelings), unsatisfactoriness (no amount of brownies will make the pain go away), and non-self (these feelings of desire, shutting down are not who we are). 2. 10am -5pm 10am: Invitation to co -create sangha - 5 minutes 10:05am: Introduction of topic and the three marks of existence - 15 minutes 10:20am: Sitting meditation - 30 minutes 10:50am: Dharmette: impermanence of feelings - 20 minutes 11:10am: Dyad: exploration on the changing nature of feelings/triggers - 20 minutes 11:30am: Group discussion - 20 minutes 11:50am: Sitting meditation - 25 minutes 12:15pm: Mindful eating instruction 12:30pm: Lunch: quiet conversation or silence, bell rung on occasion to bring present moment mindfulness 1:45pm: Walking meditation 2pm: Dharmette: unsatisfactoriness of life and food to change reality, second arrow suffering - 20 minutes 2:20pm: Dyad - 15 minutes 2:35pm: Group discussion - 20 minutes 2:55pm: Break - 10 minutes 3:05pm: Sitting meditation: 20 minu 3:25pm: Dharmette: non- 20 minutes 3:45pm: Triads - 20 minutes 4:05pm: Group discussion - 25 minutes 4:30pm: Upekkha and Metta practice for self - 20 minutes 4:40pm: Dedication of Merit 3. 10 people are anticipated to attend 4.

I want to present this program to offer another angle of looking at the ways we interact with food - either mindfully or mindlessly. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 130 Dawn Haney Block, Build, Be: Liberating Ourselves through Collective Liberation The Buddha taught that we each, in our fragile human bodies, have the opportunity to liberate ourselves from suffering. Liberation is also the goal of broad -based movements for racial, economic, and gender justice - liberation not just for individuals, but for all harmed by oppression and injustice. Join us for a daylong where we braid together these liberatory traditio ns. Strengthen your justice skills to block harm and build inspiring alternatives, while you steep yourself in the Buddhadharma's deep practices of wisdom and compassion. Retreat Schedule & Content 9am Welcome & Overview, Communication Guidelines 9:15 Block, Build, Be: Practicing Liberation at the Intersection of Buddhism & Social Justice Exploring the tension between accepting the world as it is and feeling wrenched apart by injustice. Strengthening justice skills of blocking harm and building inspiring alternatives, through the lens of being a more wise and compassionate version of ourselves, steeped in Buddhadharma. Share example of a Buddhist blockade at the intersection of Block, Build, Be. 9:45 BE: Sitting w/ instruction - steadying power of mindfu lness 10:15 Break 10:30 BLOCK: What is nonviolence? Spectogram activity Involves moving around in the room (with accessibility options) to indicate whether you believe a particular example of an action is violent / nonviolent, and appealing / unappealing . Imagine you've been invited to... join a sitting blockade to stop a deportation bus glue the locks to real estate developers' offices hack into an FBI database to steal surveillance files on Black Lives Matter activists burn down a field of Monsanto GMO corn or sabotage a luxury condo construction site climb and live in a tree to stop deforestation sit meditation on train tracks where tar sands oil is being shipped from Alberta 11:00: BUILD: Nonviolence discussion using progressive stack - giving extra priority in conversation to people who are most impacted CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 131 As participants respond to scenarios, the group develops a sense of how different people define violence and nonviolence. Discuss nonviolence as a life commitment vs. diversity of tactics. How does it look different when we view the first precept on an individual vs. systemic level (e.g. is it more violent to smash a window or to pay taxes that fund US wars?) 11:30 Sitting w/ instruction - compassion practice for self & others 12:00 BREAK FOR LUNCH 1:00 Sitting w/ instruction - mindfulness of the body 1:30 BLOCK: Bringing our Dharma Superpowers into the Fire Identify personal strengths rooted in our dharma practice that help us be skillful activists Partner share: What dharma superpower(s) do you bring (or want to bring) to your political liberation work? Bring that superpower into a \"hassle line\" where you practice being in a heated conversation with someone who is upset about the protest you are participating in. 2:15 BUILD: Caucusing - how do we work with anger as it arises? Break into identity-based groups to discuss anger (could be by race, gender, or other factors important to the group. Invite the group to \"try it out\" as one tool that's been used in social justice movements to deepen anal ysis and build safety and intimacy. Notice what happens in the body and mind as we move into groups, as we participate in the groups, as we discuss afterwards. Give a brief overview of how our social identities affect our conditioning around anger, and how others perceive us around anger. 3:00 BREAK 3:15 BUILD: Discussion of anger & the experience of caucusing Practice again with progressive stack - giving extra priority in conversation to people who are most impacted.

CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 136 Max Airborne Nourishing our relationship to our practice How are we relating to our practice? Do we feel the beauty and kindness of practice? Do we relate to it with impatience, self-criticism, boredom or obligation? Why do we practice? Does our practice resemble our life, or does it feel separate from it? In this daylong for folks who have some experience with dharma practice, we'll look deeply at wise relationship to practice. Like any relationship, the relat ionship we have with our practice needs care and feeding. We'll look at some ways to nourish this important relationship, and create the best possible conditions for our practice to bring us deeper freedom. Retreat schedule of the entire day - 9:30 am.

Cultivating kindness as a foundation for our practice. Not just during metta meditation, but as a general attitude and a lens. Seeing our practice as a kindness to ourselves and the world. Remembering/Sati. We often lose the sense of what practice is about. One of the jobs of mindfulness, Sati, is about remembering that we are on a path to liberation, and remembering what we've learned that will help us along the path. The importance of appreciation. Noticing kindness and other skillful qualities when they arise, and appreciating them will help those qualities grow.

CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 142 This is an ambitious program that I imagine developing in pieces and eventually offering in total if I can find an audience/interest. It builds on a series I have offered for caregivers at the Mindfulness Care Center with several other teachers. It represents the intersection of my meditation practice and my work with death and dying. I have been inspired by the work by many in this field, including Stephen Levine, Joan Halifax, Frank Ostaseski on death/dying and Thich Nhat Hahn, Michael Carroll, and Sharon Salzburg on taking Buddhism to work. May I have the courage, humility and enough understanding of this unknowable subject to organize and offer these teachings.

Our culture has taught us to \"tighten up and turn away\" from physical or emotional pain, and yet these forms of resistance often make us feel worse. This silent, day -long retreat will offer the basic tools of Mindful Self-Compassion, which support us in \"opening up and turning toward\" our painful experiences. We can learn to be our own best nurturer in difficult times - to soften and soothe life's woes, building emotional resilience and minimiz ing the suffering in life's inevitable difficult times. This day will include lecture, discussion, simple guided meditations and journaling exercises. It is appropriate for beginners to meditation and anyone curious about using the tools of Mindfulness to build emotional resilience. It draws on the Mindful Self -Compassion work of Dr. Kristin Neff, Dr. Christopher Germer and Tara Brach, among others.

CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 148 (3) a detailed outline of the dharma content of what you would like to cover, Welcome: Inclusivity, looking for your \"peeps\" We're each other's \"peeps\" Setting the Container - What do you need to feel safe here? (popcorn offerings) build a list: Confidentiality, Deep listening, No fixing, Advice Giving. Non-judgmental, supportive attitude How To Be Here - As a scientist, curiosity, open to new possibilities, open to the unfamiliar; see what happens - any reaction is good information, grist for the mill. Opening Talk: Introducing Mindfulness & Self-Compassion as Means/Tool of Resilience What is resilience - Enjoy and take satisfaction from the good; ride through the difficult with trust, relative ease; let upsets calm relatively soon and not carry their residues forward. Not make it worse than it needs to be by adding more logs to the fire. It will naturally burn out. Emotional Bounce-Back. Culture/Conditioning teaches us to \"Tighten U p and Turn Away\" from pain. Resistance, Distraction, Avoidance. Do these work? Tend to make it worse. Shinzen Young - Suffering = Pain x Resistance (Show the film The Fly) Teaching of Throwing the 2 nd Dart: Resilience is self-compassionately and skillfully tending to the first Dart, and not throwing the 2nd and 3rd. Our internal Critic throws a second dart. The natural state of things is to arise (causes and conditions) and pass away. If we don't keep adding logs, the fire will naturally burn out. Research shows that an emotion will pass in about 90 seconds if the mind doesn't grab onto it and add more fuel and re -activate it. But what does the \"untrained mind\" do? (verbalize examples) A lot of our mental rehashing puts more logs on the fire, reactivates the upset, causes more suffering and prolongs the episode. Our question becomes, how ideally, would the \"trained mind\" respond? How to we keep from throwing more darts, How do we let the emotion naturally pass, the fire burn itself out? Mindfulness. What is Mindfulness: Paying clear attention to the thoughts and sensory experience that are present Here, Now. Without Judgment, Commentary and Conclusions. Jon Kabat-Zinn's definition: Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment, non-judgmentally. How do we do this? Break the untrained mind's mental habit of being in a thought -virtual reality. Elsewhere. Use an anchor in the here and now for our attention. 1. Breath as an anchor. Neutral, we don't tend to have a story about the breath, always here, centered in the body. 2. Hearing bells or sounds in the room, (good if body is numb or uncomfortable, breathing is difficult). 3 Body sensations of sitting posture. 4 Sensations in the feet in wa lking meditation. The mind will wander off. It's not about Not Thinking. Just come back = a \"rep\" in training. Helpful to use noting technique to give the mind a task in service of the Mindfulness. Tends to CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 149 calm it down, bone to a dog. More basic instruction - segue to the meditation. Introduce RAIN: R = Recognize, A = Allow R: The most basic element of Mindfulness - Step One: What is going on? What's happening. Allow - means can you meet this as it is right now. The opposite of resistance . Sometimes use word accept, but that carries connotation of \"you've changed your mind and are okay with this now.\" Allow doesn't mean you no longer wish it weren't so. It means you can be with what is - however unpleasant it may be - without resistance , aversion, flight, avoidance, reactivity. Allow is the way of being with it that doesn't put more logs on the fire. Yes, you wish it would go away, \"Allow \" is the attitude toward it that will best ease it on it's way. Read TBrach Quote: (each time we meet old patterning with allowing, mindfulness it defuses) Use in discussion, Q&C \"Invite the fear/anger in for tea...\" This is how we \"Open up and turn toward\" Reflection after the 2 nd meditation: Jack Kornfield's line - as we infuse a sensation with allowing presence, it's as if we're saying \"Yes, This too. \" Rumi's Guest House poem. Afternoon Talk: What is Compassion - the Open Heart's Response to Suffering. Quotes... Develop the Definition. Movement of the heart to soothe, relieve Key components: Mindfulness, Kindness, Common Humanity Difference between Mindfulness (Accept just as it is) vx Compassion (Wish it were Different) Mindfulness is of the Experience - Compassion is for the ExperiencER Self-Compassion adds Soften & Soothe into the Allow as qualities of Allowing Self-Compassion phrases to offer yourself (K Neff's \"self-Compassion Break) Mind/Heart translation Citta, could well be \"heartfulness\" (precedes western separation of mind and heart) Talk: Finishing RAIN I = Investigation N = N ot Taking Personally Investigation - curious open, What is this Experience? What is Anger really like? Feel into the details of the sensory experience. Pressure, tingling, heat, quivering, pricking... Mental investigation (my mom always..., this reminds me of...) has it's place, and it's not here. Stay in touch with the physical experience. Non-Identification, Not taking personally. This is not You. Ways we take personally and Identify with experience. Trungpa's bird drawing - shift: the sky with a bird fly ing though it. You are the sky. Wrap-up: these are the points of RAIN. Essentially a short -hand catchy way to describe the factors of Mindfulness as the Buddha Taught. Lifted out of Buddhism and offered in secular terminology to everyday life => gone mainstream. This mindfulness practice is at the core, but not the whole path! Must be put in context with ethical living, generosity practice, and compassion. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 150 Final discussions: Topics which might be included - as they come up from what's offered: Working with the Inner Critic Jos Goldstein Quote - Samurai saying \"Make your Mind Your Friend\" Negativity Bias, Savor and Take in the Good, Compassion is a source of strength, not wimpy (and other misconceptions) More self-compassionate people tend to take responsibility for mistakes, risk failure (costs of mistakes/failure are not so devastating) Self- Compassion is very diff from Self-Esteem, independently vary Ending: This is the training, to undertake, to reduce suffering, (not throw 2 nd and 3rd darts) to minimize time required for difficult states to pass (Not adding logs to the fire). Increase compassion for self and other and de -fuse the inner critic. Create a gap between the mind's immediate Reaction and allow for a (more thoughtful?) Response. This is Resilience. Final Poem - St Francis and the Sow (Sometimes it's necessary to re -teach a thing it's loveliness\") And/or Derek Walcott's Love After Love Close with sharing of the merit and metta: \"May we be open to suffering, with wisdom and compassion. May we accept ourselves and others, just as we are. May all beings live in peace. May all beings be free.\" (4) a short bio with a description of your qualifications or experience that might draw people to your event: Suzanne Col\u00f3n has been meditating in the Insight (Vipassana) tradition since 1992 and has been a member of the Bozeman Insight Community since moving here in 1998.

CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 152 Booker Program title: An Embodied Investigation of Skillful Speech and Action 1. Please describe the program, including its content, theme, and purpose. How do we respond to a world whose suffering is a byproduct of the systemic injustices in this world? Sometimes, the best thing might be to wish them well from afar, and sometimes, an engaged response is what the body is calling for. During our time together we will investigate social activism through the lens of the Buddha's teachings of Skillful Speech and Skillful Action, and how we can use our body to inform us to create social action that is generative and sustainable. This daylong workshop will include dyad practice, asana and meditation, will be accessible to all and mindful of historic, physical and residual traumas in the body. 2. Please give a schedule of the day's events with amount of time allotted for various activities, including m editation periods. Please see second page. 3. How many people might reasonably be anticipated to attend? I would expect about 20 -30 people for this daylong. 4. In what month and year do you propose the program occur (or start)? It would be ideal to have about 2 months lead time to advertise, this daylong will be June 12th, 2016. 5. What would be the program's venue? (Example: Community Hall, church, library, home, office, etc) Yoga studio or community space 6. How would the teacher(s) be compensated for leading the program (Example: \"Dana\" or fee-based) 7. What background and experience prepares the teacher to lead or teach the program? Booker is a facilitator, public speaker, consultant, and yoga teacher. Sharing mindfulness and yoga with incarcerated and system -involved youth since 2007, she serves as Director of Trainings for Lineage Project. Co-founding the Meditation Working Group of Occupy Wall Street, she continues to utilize social justice principles and embodied wisdom practices, to offer workshops on college campuses, national diversity trainings for yoga teachers, and retreats for refuge and resiliency for activists. Booker is on faculty with the Engaged Mindfulness Institute, Spirit Rock's Mindful Yoga and Meditation training and Off the Mat, Into the World. She will complete Spirit Rock's Community Dharma Leaders' Training in 2017. 8. Why do you want to present this program? I have a deep passion for supporting the sustainability of front line change makers through Mindful Yoga, meditation, and compassionate dialogue. Before I had a strong practice, I explored activism with my eyes and ears shut, and my mouth wide open. Without having Sangha or community, I found myself burned out very quickly.

Title: From the cushio n to the marketplace .** Rationale : This daylong is intended to encourage practitioners to integrate their lives into their practice and their practice into their lives. It would be directed to a Spanish-speaking audience. To people who have a solid grou nding in vipassana, and who preferably, but not necessarily, have been exposed to the Brahmaviharas. In the Latin cultures, interpersonal mindfulness acquires special importance, as these are very relational cultures, highly family-oriented, and face spe cial challenges wrt living in this society (especially as immigrants and as im migrantes of color). The questions and comments of students that surface time and again are related to applying pra ctice to family and other relationships in their lives. I have seen that the dharma can really come alive for many Spanish speakers when they can see it as a way to enhance personal relationships or face challenges involving personal relationships. (At another time, I would like to design a program directed particula rly to the use of intrapersonal and interpersonal mindfu lness to face the challenges of xenophobia, language and cultural barriers, and more.) Description: A kind, clear and stable awareness is as useful in life as it is on the cushion. To live with more ease and less reactivity in the face of life's daily pressures and challenges requires a heart that is steady and quiet. In this daylong retreat, we will explore what it means to integrate our lives and our practice, focusing, in particular, on the practice of interpersonal mindfulness. Using lovingkindness and the Foundations of Mindfulness as our starting points, we will use silent and guided meditations, interactive activities, and group inquiry to remember how to move our practice from the cushion t o the marketplace. Schedule : 9:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m., with one hour, ten minutes for lunch. 9:00 - 9:30 Silent meditation 9:30 - 10:00 Introductory talk: What would it mean to practice external mindfulness?

Noticing the thoughts, interpretations, discomfort, etc. that arise in this rather intimate practice. Each will tell the other how they perceived the other person's eyes or movements, and the partner will confirm or not their perception. A question for the de - briefing: What gets in the way of fresh perception?

Group inquiry. Q&A Dharma Content: Elements of introduction and afternoon talk. Lay foundation for practice off the cushion. Some important points. a. two wings of the bird: the relative , relational self in the world (compassion) , the ultimate self (or not -self; emptiness) b. compassion = wisdom in action. The wisdom that we cultivate on the cushion takes form in the world as compassion/love. Wisdom is not wisdom if it doesn't manifest as love or kindness . c. The Satipatthana Instructions : to contemplate internally AND externally. We not only cultivate awareness of our own body/feelings, etc. But also those of others. Contemplating externally refers to others' feelings, mind states, etc. Quote from Analayo, Bikkhu d. The refuge of Sangha = underlies the importance of relationship; the importance of external mindfulness e. Successful practice produces people who are k\u00ednder and more lighthearted in the world. f. Sometimes we tend to protect our practice from certain parts of our personality or ce rtain parts of our lives, albeit unconsciously. Spiritual bypass. For liberation to be complete or genuine, it has to integrate into our whole stream of being; to filter down into our personality. Some relevant quotes: (J. Kornfield) Here's another thing: I used to think that sitting in meditation was enough, that it would really change everything in your life in a whole and complete way. For a few people, it might work out that way, but in general, it ain't so. For most of us, meditation is one part of a whole mandala of awakening, which includes attention to your body, attention to your relationships, attention to right speech and right livelihood. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 158 Using meditation or therapy to try to shut down parts of our experience is ultimately counterproductive. We do not have to be afraid of entering unfamiliar territory once we have learned how to hold experience within the gentleness of our own minds. Learning to transform obstacles into objects of meditation provides a much needed bridge b etween the stillness of the concentrated mind and the movement of real life. Working from the outside in: We often talk about what we should refrain from doing to support the conditions for practice, for concentration, etc. (refrain from killing, steali ng and so on). What about what we CAN do actively off the cushion to support our meditation. The role of the Brahmaviharas? What might constitute BVH type activities in body, speech and mind toff the cushion to cultivate freedom? Can you relate this to becoming more fully human? *Anyone is welcome to use this daylong. And, if you use it in its entirety or most of it, I would simply ask you to consider crediting your inspiration to the author, whose teaching emphases often center around interpersonal mindfulness/the intersection of internal and external mindfulness . (-: If you do not feel comfortable doing so, no worries, use it anyway! Thank you. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 159 Wendy Eisner CDL March Homework-Part 1: Daylong description I will be giving a daylong retreat o n October 8, 2016. Tri- State Dharma has its own format for scheduling and outreach of day long retreats as well as our longer retreats, so I have included the materials from our website, as well as the flyer that I designed. I should note that I am on the Board of Directors for Tri- State Dharma, so I do discuss and have influence in the process of scheduling and developing retreats. I have designed a day long that will be open to beginners and experienced meditators, and have chosen the Second Noble Truth (craving) as the topic for the dharma talk and I expound on that in part 3. I plan to weave the topic into the opening session, just a bit, and then expand on those ideas in the Dharma Talk in the afternoon. I have incorporated a stretching session into the afternoon session as well. If it's a nice day, maybe we can do the stretching outside, since we have beautiful grounds on which to walk. I will also be putting aside time in the morning to give basic sitting and walking meditation instructions to the b eginners or anyone that wants to brush up. I also will include Q & A in the sitting and close at the end of the day long.

Sometimes it is called desire or wanting. I thought this would be a pretty straightforward topic and I could do it off the cuff but it isn't and I can't . It also brings up all sorts of judgments and reactions in me and I am sure to you; it isn't a particularly pleasant word or concept. It certainly is the source of a lot of problems, if you look at how it is defined or introduce d by the Buddha: And what is suffering, what is the origin of suffering, what is the cessation of suffering, what is the way leading to the cessation of suffering? Birth is suffering; aging is suffering; sickness is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair are suffering; not to obtain what one wants is suffering; in short, the five aggregates affected by clinging are suffering. This is called suffering. And what is the origin of suffering? It is craving, which brings renewal of being, is accompanied by delight and lust, and delights in this and that; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for being and craving for non-being. This is called the origin of suffering. And what is the cessation of suffering? It is the complete fading away and ceasing, the giving up, relinquishing, letting go and rejecting of that same craving. This is called the cessation of suffering. Of course, the entire path is designed to accomplish this, so it is not the easiest thing to give u p, and there are all sorts of gradations and variations of craving, from the most obvious and gross, like the craving for a big juicy steak, to the most subtle and intangible, like the craving for being, the craving for a spiritual path. These are unwhole some cravings (which lead to suffering ) and some types of desires are distinguished from these, like desire for awakening, desire for the good of a loved one, desire for the happiness of another. We can certainly see craving coming up all the time, and we can also see that's why we suffer (sometimes the word stress is used instead of suffering).. How many times today did craving come up? Even if it's really subtle, like wanting the sitting meditation to be over, or wanting to shift our weight to become co mfortable. On long CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 161 retreats it always cracked me up that I would be waiting for the bell to end the meditation which would mean what? What important things did I have to do on a 10- day retreat? The meals, of course. But so what? It was as though my min d had to have some desire object to fixate on, even if there was nothing going on. So I would crave the end of one sitting, and so on, until I was at the end of the retreat and starting to regret the end of the retreat, which is another type of craving! Which brings us to the next part of craving, which the Buddha called clinging. Very appropriate. He actually developed a very sophisticated set of causal links : Because a feeling arises, Craving arises. But what is craving? As a feeling arises, it is either pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. The \"CRAVING\" which comes next in the process, (occurring very quickly too) is manifested by the \"I like it\" or \"I don't like it\" mind of ours. OK. Next comes the CLINGING, which is the story our minds run away with about wh y we like it or don't like it (whatever \"it\" is that arose!). Qe can see how this works in our lives. It can happen that we see something desirable , like an iPhone 6 . We could just see the iPhone 6 and not react to it. But, something in our minds may respond to it, and then we desire it. Then, we might see ourselves going out and buying it . If you are like me, this part, after the craving, fully submerged in the clinging, can go on for quite a while. When I finally got the iPhone , by the way, I had a little fun with it, I used it, but it certainly didn't make me eternally happy! Okay, a more romantic example. We may see an attractive person and may, with time, fall in love with and marry him. We have so many stories running through our mind abo ut romantic love, you can imagine all the craving, desire, grasping, wanting, clinging that go on with this. Our culture has indoctrinated us to believe that this is the end and we should live happily ever after. However, what does love look like in our culture? Is it really love or is something else going on? These are the types of love that exist without craving or clinging: These are called in Pali the brahmaviharas; or four divine abodes. They are loving -kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and eq uanimity. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dharma Event 162 Another aspect to the whole process of craving and clinging is that it is entirely dependant on the passing of time. The arising of craving and clinging arising is a process. When we crave something we will cling to it even as it is passing away, or mourn the thing that is passing away and wish things would be like that again. Or we might project into the future, and wish we could have something to look forward to, like I did with the Ipod. But I don't think craving works in the present moment. My daughter was in constant battle with the passage of time when she was a young teenager...she hated the idea of anything coming to an end. So she would not want to leave her junior high school even though her friend were coming with her, because she didn't want things to change or her security to be upset and she was slowly becoming aware that things were always changing. Of course, she always told me that I didn't understand the pathos of what she was going through, not seeing that if there is one thing anyone on earth could understand, it was the awareness that everything will change. So, of course if one dwells in the present moment, they can't come into existence. You can even turn that around and say that when craving and clinging disappear, you ARE completely present. My most ridiculous experience of this, but also one of the most delightful, came about 2 years ago when I was coming back from a conference in Alaska. I was getting on a red eye flight, and the flight was completely packed. I had a window seat, but there was no window in that row. Then, as the plane filled up, a very fat, very ill woman was pretty much carried to the seat next to me and she plopped down, breathing irregularly and jabbing her walking stick into my seat. Then the babies , all around us, dozens of them, began to wail on cue. I was pretty much at the end of my rope, but as a new meditator, I tried Thich Nhat Hanh's exercise: Breathing in, I relax; breathing out, I smile. Breathing in, \"I am in the present moment, breathing out, \"It's a Wonderful moment.\" I got to the \"Breathing out, I am in the present moment,\" and suddenly I was. Nothing changed, except my perception of the moment, and I tell you I would not have changed anything in the world in that moment. Needless to s ay, I didn't stay there, but I was delighted enough with that momentary insight to have a reasonable night's sleep. CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 163 So that is all I have to say about craving. The only other thing I wanted to say was to paraphrase the Zen instructions about meditation, w hich really is asking you to drop all of your preconceived notions about meditation and the path and all your judgments about whether you are doing it right: Do not try to become anybody. Don't create another identity. When you sit, just sit. Part 4, outreach (flyer; website) and biography: Are you stressed and tired? Ready for a break?

Today we will practice with some of our most habitual friends that come to visit us, through our thoughts, emotions, and moods. We will examine our reactivity to whatever arrives moment to moment, and discover skillful ways to work with these. Through our time together we will begin to see clearly the deep connection between the mind~heart~body and investigate how these hindrances cause false beliefs to take hold. By utilizing the tools of Mindfulness meditation \"Insight\" and calming practices we will begin to unravel these places that CDL5 \u2014Spring 2016 Creating a Daylong Dha rma Event 175 catch us, bind us, and keep us stuck in unhealthy, unwholesome, and at times destructive patterns of being. This day of practice will foster the qualities of peace and ease to arise, which are our true nature. 2.
