The mind-body connection presents a tremendous, largely untapped and under-researched theory of healing that relates to many conditions, including pain management. A person's overall mind, body and emotional health can all have a huge impact on physical pain. Chiropractic treatment, with a [chiropractor Gaithersburg MD](http://advancedwellnesssystems.com/chiropractor-gaithersburg/) patients can count on, is currently one of the most popular holistic healing methods. The mind-body connection is a big part of holistic medical practice and thought, and therefore it is at the crux of chiropractic. A Closer Look at the Mind-Body Connection Simply put, the mind-body connection refers to how your physical health is intertwined with how you feel, think, and behave. It states that your emotional and mental wellbeing can positively or negatively affect your physical wellbeing, and vice versa. This concept is widely accepted in many circles today, including within many medical communities, but this was not always the case. Many \"traditional\" approaches to healing have historically looked at the mind and the body as a single, united entity. This began changing as scientists started to make important medical discoveries that focused on the physical body. The creation of \"Western medicine\" led to many important medical advances \u2014 such as a deeper understanding of treating infections and preventing diseases \u2014 but it notably ignored the psychological side of a person's health. Starting in the 1900s, doctors again began considering how these two sides may interact and affect each other. Professionals who once relied solely on scientific research began to see the value in \"alternative\" healing methods, such as physical therapy, acupuncture, acupressure, and chiropractic. While physical injuries often have specific physical causes and treatments, many doctors now recognize that emotional and mental factors could also be affecting someone's physical health. Lower back pain, for example, could be the result of sitting at a desk all day at work, but it might also be the result of mental or emotional stress. Treating just one side of the problem \u2014 only the physical side or only the psychological side \u2014 might not result in full healing. How Does This Relate to Chiropractic? By taking a more holistic approach to patients' wellbeing, chiropractors can do a wonderful job of representing the mind-body approach to managing pain. At our clinic, we encourage patients to try a variety of services to find what truly works for them. We help our patients understand the root cause of their pain and we discuss possible options for preventing or mitigating pain in the future. Stressors that might affect your whole-body health can include: - Experiencing financial problems - Losing a job or failing to advance in your career - Suffering from ailments or illness - Romantic or relationship troubles - Dealing with the passing of a loved one If you've encountered any of these common experiences, it certainly wouldn't be surprising if you also started experiencing headaches, higher blood pressure, or even back and neck pain. Many people find that combining sessions with a personal therapist and chiropractic treatments are a great way to approach pain management.
