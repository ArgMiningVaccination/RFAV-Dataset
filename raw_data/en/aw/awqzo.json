Please note that per standard regulatory principles, WHO does not recommend use of vaccines beyond their labelled expiry date. However, based on public health needs and the assessment of scientific data done by relevant regulatory authorities of reference under Emergency Use Listing (EUL), the extension of expiration date may be applied retroactively to previously-produced vaccine batches of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.Vaccine arrival to -90\u00b0C shipping container: -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C up to 30 days with regular replenishment of dry ice, orTransfer to freezer: -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C (once for up to 2 weeks), to refrigerator: to +8\u00b0CTransfer to thermal shipping container: -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C up to 30 days with regular replenishment of dry ice, orTransfer to refrigerator: +2\u00b0C to at -25\u00b0C delivery)Continue to store +2\u00b0C store in refrigerator:+2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0CTransport considerations+2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C: transport time should not exceed 48 hours due to sensitivity to shaking and vibrations.+2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C: the product is more stable and can be transported at any time within the 10 weeks' shelf life.*Remaining shelf life at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C and +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C temperatures includes the time spent in both storage and transport.

All vaccine formulations have lot number and manufacturing date printed on label. WHO recommends the expiration date is also printed on label (for both primary and secondary packaging) but not all formulations have this information on primary packaging (vial). No formulations have VVM on vial label.Different carton sizes hold 10 vials or 195 vials. Initial supply of grey cap and orangecap vaccines may also be delivered in 195-pack trayboxes. Later supply may come in carton boxes only. Labelling information: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (Paediatricformulation) COVAXwillsupplypaediatricformulationofPfizer-BioNTechCOVID-19vaccinewithonlythemanufacturingdateprintedonlabel.Certain lots of paediatricdoses(orange cap)have NO expiration date printed on label; only the manufacturing date is shown. Instead, a QR code which provides the expiration date is printed on the carton/secondary packaging and must be checked with a QR code reader. When scanned the QR code leads to the information on the expiration date based on the approved shelf-life extension (18 months) at -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C storage condition.Since the QR code is printed ONLY on the carton, an SOP for tracking expiration date must be in place to ensure Vaccine Store/ Cold Chain Managers are able to check the vaccine's expiration date upon delivery and monitor remaining shelf life during storage at different temperatures. (See Module 2: managing shelf life and dynamic labelling). Vaccines must be kept in their original carton until use. During vaccination session, health workers should always check the expiration date marked on the carton before use. How to check vaccine expiration date through the QR Code? (1/3)1.One must have a smart phone or a special application that can read a QR code. You can download any free QR code reader application on your mobile device. 2.Look for the QR code on carton label. Position your phone camera facing the QR code.3.The mobile phone should scan the QR code automatically. Click on the link that appears on your screen, which will lead you to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID19 Vaccine website (http://www.cvdvaccine.com) 4.Look for the dropdown menu for \"health care workers\" and select the word \"COVAX\"from among the list of countries. Do not select your own country. You will be redirected to a homepage which has the link to the \"Expiry date information\". Scan the QR codeSelect \"COVAX: from dropdown vaccine the QR Code? (2/3)5.Click on the \"Expiry date information\" button to access the information on the expiration date for each of the different vaccine products. 6.Look for the expiration date that corresponds to the type of vaccine supply you received (PBS or Tris/Sucrose formulation; expiration date printed on label or not).Information on the new expiration date corresponds to the approved extension of shelf life at -90C to -60C storage temperature: 18 months for both Tris/Sucrose and PBS/sucrose formulation.Look for correct expiration dateClick on \"Expiry Date Information\"How to check vaccine expiration date through the QR Code? (3/3)7.Read the information carefully to determine the expiration date that would apply to your country's situation based on the labelling information and your national regulatory authority's approval to apply the new shelf life at -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C storage temperature.8.Mark each carton with the appropriate expiration date using a permanent marker, sticker or other long-lasting manner as shown in the example on the right, before storing the cartons in the ULT freezer. 9.Once the vaccine is moved to a refrigerator to thaw, the expiry date on the carton must be updated to reflect the 10 weeks shelf life at +2C to +8C.(See module 2: Dynamic labelling)It is important that the expiration date is easily visible to cold chain officers and vaccine handlers. The information would allow responsible officers to:\u00fcProperly apply the earliest expiry-first out (EEFO) principle when distributing vaccines to lower levels, \u00fcCorrectly update the expiration date when vaccine is moved from ULT freezer to refrigerator,\u00fcDecide if the vaccine is still useable or not.Mark \"Expiry date\" on cartonExpiration date Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (Paediatricformulation)Based on NRA approval, MOH confirms order and accepts vaccine delivery at -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C.Step 2 Subnational store updates expiration date on packaging once vaccine is thawed in a refrigerator. Remaining shelf life at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C: 10 weeks Step 5Health worker checks expiration date on carton before using the vaccine at session point. Discard unused doses 6 hours after opening.-- Step 6NRA review and approve expiration date based on Certificate of Analysis (COA) or Exceptional Approval of shelf-life extension.Step 1 Central store checks expiration date by scanning the QR code.NRA approved expiration date based on Dynamic Labelling2 possible scenarios:NRA approved expiration date is based on COA Central store marks carton with expiration date at -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C storage on the carton/secondary packaging. Shelf life: 18 months from the date of manufacture.Central store checks expiration date per shipping document/COA. Step 3Step 3Step 4 For next session, use first the vaccine with earliest expiry date. Monitor and report vaccine supply utilization and wastage. Step 7 (apply to all vaccines) Module 2: Operational considerations on vaccine management and administrationTarget audience: Immunization managers, supervisors, health workers, supply chain officersand cold chain managersPfizer BioNTechCOVID-19 Vaccine COMIRNATY\u00ae (Tozinameran)7 February 2023 recommendation on of primary seriesFor purple cap,grey capand orange cap formulations:At least 2 doses with 4-8 weeks interval are necessary for protection:Dose 1: at the start dateDose 2: 4 to 8 weeks after first dose.*If the 2nd dose is accidently administered earlier than 4 weeks, DO NOT repeat the dose. If the 2nd dose is inadvertently delayed beyond 8 weeks, the dose should be given at the earliest possible opportunity.A series started with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine should be completed with this product. Every effort should be made to determine which product was received as the first dose. In exceptional situations, if the vaccine product given as the first dose cannot be determined or is no longer available, any mRNA COVID-19 vaccine product may be administered at least 4 weeks after the first dose.*WHO SAGE recommends that the second dose should be provided 4 to 8 weeks after the first dose, preferentially 8 weeks as a longer interval between doses is associated with higher vaccine effectiveness and potentially lower risk of myocarditis/pericarditis.Manufacturer recommends 21-28 days interval.Note that VCV Original/ Omicron BA.4-5) is NOT recommended to be used for the primary vaccination series. However, there is an expectation that this will change in the near future.18SAGE recommendation on schedule of extended primary seriesFor purple cap,grey capand orange cap formulations:WHO recommends that the primary vaccine series in moderately to severely immunocompromised persons (ICPs) should be extended to include an additional dose for all COVID-19 vaccines that have received WHO EUL.Give 1 to 3 months after the completion of primary series to increase protection for ICPs. If more than 3 months have elapsed since the last dose in the standard primary series, the additional dose in an extended primary series should be given at the earliest opportunity.A homologous additional dose in an extended primary series should currently be considered standard practiceAlternative heterologous platforms for the additional dose may also be considered, taking into account current vaccine supply, vaccine supply projections, and other access considerations.Note that the variant containing vaccines (VCV Original/Omicron BA.1and VCV Original/ Omicron BA.4-5) is NOT recommended to be used for the primary vaccination series. 19SAGE recommendation on schedule of booster doseThe objective of a booster dose is to attempt to restore vaccine effectiveness.For purple cap and grey cappresentations:Booster dose is given to 18 years old and above 6 months after completion of the primary series,in accordance with the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.Provide booster dose to highest priority-use groups (e.g. older adults and health workers).Once high booster dose coverage has been achieved in the highest priority-use group, countries may also consider a booster for other lower priority-use groups.If more than 6 months have elapsed since the completion of the primary series, the booster dose should be given at the earliest opportunity.For orange cap presentation:The need for and timing of booster dose for children aged 5-11 years has not yet been determined.Using the same product to complete primary and booster schedule is considered standard practice. However, WHO supports programmatic flexibility and supports use of vectored vaccines and recombinant protein subunit vaccine to complete primary series and/or booster vaccination (\"heterologous schedule\").20Logistics for dose preparation Supplies needed per vialFor diluent withdrawal and mixing For vaccine administration (orange cap) (intramuscular injection): dilute to use, 5-11 years old 1 vial 0.9% sodium chloride solution forinjectionOther materials such as alcohol swabs, PPEOne piece3 mL syringe (optimal size) or 5-mL syringe to withdraw diluent One piece21-gauge or narrower needle should be used to withdraw the diluent.Use the same needle to add the diluent to the vialIdeally,Ten pieces of 0.2 mL auto-disable (AD) syringes with 23-gauge x 1-inch (0.60 x 25 mm) needles for intramuscular injectionIdeally, Six pieces of0.3 mL Auto disable (AD) syringeswith 23-gauge x 1-inch needles intramuscular injectionFor vaccine administration (purple cap) (intramuscular injection): dilute to use, 12 years and older For vaccine administration (grey cap) (intramuscular injection): do not dilute, 12 years and olderIdeally, Six of0.3 mL AD-syringeswith 23-gauge x 1-inch needles for intramuscular injection For waste disposal for all used devicesOne cardboard safety box for every100 used syringes and needles* Currently, the 0.2 mL AD syringe is not available.

Refer to the Management and safe disposal of COVID-19 vaccination waste at health facility levelfor more information on managing used syringes.Maximizing available doses per vial Syringe dead spaceRepresents a volume of vaccine retained in the syringe after fully depressed the plunger for the administration of the full dose .The number of doses stated on label and number of doses that can actually be withdrawn may be different. The true number of doses available from a multi-dose vial depends on:syringe dead space; vial overfill volume; and technique and accuracy of doses withdrawn and delivered. Overfill volumeThis is the extra vaccine put in a vial to aid health workers in delivering the intended number of accurate doses. Overfill accounts for vaccine retained in the vial, syringe or needle and vaccine loss during the adjustment of the dose if ejected in the air.Low dead space syringeType of syringe that limits the dead space that exists between the plunger rod of the syringe and the base of the needle (fluid remain in the syringe luer).Maximizing available doses per vial \u009fEach dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine for purple cap andgrey cap and 0.2 mL for orange cap.\u009fAfter dilution, 6 doses for purple cap andgrey cap and 10 doses for orange cap can be extracted from each vial.\u009fAD and RUP that have low dead space should be used in order to extract 6 doses (purple cap/grey cap )and 10 doses (orange cap) from a single vial. The dead volume should be of no more than 35 microlitres.

Please note that per standard regulatory principles, WHO does not recommend use of vaccines beyond their labelled expiry date. However, based on public health needs and the assessment of scientific data done by relevant regulatory authorities of reference under Emergency Use Listing (EUL), the extension of expiration date may be applied retroactively to previously-produced vaccine batches of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.9 months Now:Initially:18 months for purple cap, Original/Omicron and 32Vaccine shelf life\u009fPfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine shelf life depends on the type of formulation and current storage temperature.\u009fEvery time the vaccine is moved to a different storage temperature, update the expiration date on label based on the remaining shelf life under the new storage condition.\u009fTransferring vaccine to another storage temperature and re-labelling of each trayboxesor cartons (e.g. dynamic labelling) should be done in less than 3-5 minutes*Dynamic labelling is the process of manually updating the vaccine expiration date on trayboxor carton label as it moves from -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C to either -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C or +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C storage temperatures.\u009fIf the expiration date is not printed on label and the information is accessible only via QR code, consider marking the carton with \"expiration date at -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C: (indicate date)\" before storage at ULT freezer for reference. \u009fThe expiration date at -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0Cstorage should be respected if it comes earlier than expiration date at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C and +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C.*For purple cap presentation, storage and transport at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C can be considered for a single period of up to 2 weeks within the vaccine shelf life. Before the end of 2-week period, the vaccine should be thawed for use.***Follow your national policy regarding the off-label retrospective application of the shelf life extension, which is 18 months for both PBS/Sucrose and Tris/Sucrose formulations.**See Module 3 for recommended storage and transfer times between storage environments.33Uponmovingthepurplecapvaccinefromonestoragetemperaturetoanother,theupdatedexpirationdatemustbewrittenontheoutertrayboxusingapermanentmarkeroronalabelledsticker.Crossouttheexpirationdateat-90\u00b0Cto-60\u00b0Conlabelbutitshouldremainvisible.Expirationdateat-90\u00b0Cto-60\u00b0Cstorageshouldberespectedifitcomesearlierthanexpirationdateat-25\u00b0Cto-15\u00b0Cand+2\u00b0Cto+8\u00b0C.Allnecessarytransportanduseofthevaccineshouldtakeplacewithintheupdatedexpirationdate.Thevaccineshouldbediscardedbasedontheupdatedexpirationdateatthenewstoragetemperature.Possible scenarios using purple cap vaccine presentation as an example: If the expiration date at -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C is 31 August 2023 (e.g. 18 months' shelf life from manufacturing date):1)When vaccine is moved directly from -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0Cto +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0Con 15 July 2023, the new expiration date will be 14 August 2023 (end of 31 days).

If having supply of multiple formulations cannot be avoided, consider the following strategies:Train health workers on managing the different Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine formulations.Plan carefully vaccine orders and supply distribution to minimize having both purple cap and grey cap vaccine formulations in the supply chain, especially at the service points. Distribute for use first the purple cap vaccine until all stock is depleted before distributing the grey cap vaccine; or Consider limiting the use of each formulation separately in clearly identified geographical areas that fit in with the vaccine supply chain of the country (i.e. province/state and districts).Physically separate purple cap and grey capvaccineduring storage and transport by using separate shelves in UCC, freezers and fridges with clearly readable signs. This is especially valid for the VCV Original/Omicron BA.1 and VCV Original/ Omicron BA.4-5 formulations, which are currently not recommended to be used for the primary vaccination series.Attach on the refrigerator (+2C to 8C storage) a visual guide on cold chain, dynamic labelling/expiration date management of the different vaccine formulations.40Managing availability different vaccine formulations in the supply chain Remember that VCV Original/Omicron BA.1 and VCV Original/ Omicron BA.4-5 are currently not recommended to be used for the primary vaccination series.Provide health workers with a graphical/visual job aid to distinguish vaccine formulations and corresponding handling and storage requirement.If the remaining shelf life of grey cap vaccine is short, accelerate the use of purple cap vaccine by increasing coverage and organizing multiple campaign days/weeks using purple cap vaccineonly.If its not feasible to avoid having supply of both purple cap and grey capvaccineat the service points during a vaccination session, make sure they are kept in separate vaccine carriers.Ensure colour-coded labels are kept intact during session. Once a vial is opened the colour-coded cap is no longer a valid reference. \u009fMake sure the same adult (purple cap or grey cap) and paediatricvaccine (orange cap) formulations are provided to the same facility for subsequent immunization sessions.Separate storage and distribution will increase the required storage and transport capacity. Plan ahead and make an early provision for additional capacity.

Procedures for receiving international shipment at the central storeULT freezers are very sensitive to ambient temperatures: The freezer door should not remain open for longer than 10-15 minutes. Monitor the internal temperature of ULT freezer constantly during an open-door event to ensure temperature does not increase to more than -60C. After the door is closed a waiting period is necessary to allow the ULT freezer to return to -80C before the door can be opened again.46Recommended transfer times between storage environmentsOriginating temperature environmentMaximum time at room temperature (up 25\u00b0C) during transferTime required to stay in frozen environment after room exposure during transferUnopened vial trayboxesor cartonsOpened vial trayboxesor cartonsFrom thermal to ULT freezer(-90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C)Up to 5 minutesUp to 3 minutesAt least 2 hours before they can be removed againFrom ULT freezer (-90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C)to freezer (-25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C)-Applies to purple cap ULT (-90\u00b0C -60\u00b0C)to (+2\u00b0C (-25\u00b0C refrigerator to +8\u00b0C)-Applies to purple cap onlyUp to 3 minutesUp to 1 minuteNo specified time before they can be taken out again47Orientation on manufacturer-supplied thermal shipping container 47Thermal shipping containers labelled for dangerous goods/dry ice use, have a\"UN1845\"(dry ice) marking Components of the thermal shipping container used for vaccine deliveryABCDEDry ice podVial trayboxTrayboxcompartmentFoam lidThermal shipping containerRemovable container for of dry iceHold vaccine vials or 10-pack cartonsFixed inner container that holds the vial trayboxesor cartonsFoam cover with TMD connected to the thermal shipping containerOuter carton of the thermal shipping containerThere are different models of commercial thermal shipping containers designed to maintain ULT condition during shipment.Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine arrives in either 195-pack or 10-pack thermal shipping containers as shown on the right. 195-pack 10-pack Orientation on manufacturer-supplied thermal shipping containerThe thermal shipping container is a reusable insulated container with dry ice and built-in temperature monitoring device used for transporting Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine products from manufacturer's warehouse to recipient countries. This thermal shipping containerhas specific receiving protocols in order to:confirm the potency of the vaccine; and ensure the safety of the vaccine and handlers during handling.Fully loaded weight is ~36 kg (80 lbs). Each contains either 5 trayboxesor 60 secondary cartons of vaccine.Do not expose unopened trayboxor carton to ambient temperatures of up to +25 \u00b0C for longer than 5 minutes. \u00a9 HZJZ CroatiaHoldover time is 24 hours. Re-ice the shipping container if not immediately emptied within 24 hours of arrival.When vaccine is transferred from ULT freezer to other storage temperature, update the expiration date on label (apply dynamic labelling as explained in Module 2). Store thermal shipping containers in temperate (+15 \u00b0C to +25\u00b0C) and well-ventilated room. When handling dry ice, always work in a well-ventilated room. Dry ice sublimates into (CO2) gas over time and can create a suffocation risk in confined spaces. 49Keep in mind when using thermal shipping container for vaccine storage: \u00fcCan be used as temporary storage for up to 30 days.\u00fcRe-ice the shipping container every 5 days thereafter.\u00fcAn estimated 15 kg of dry ice per container is needed during each re-icing.\u00fcWhen fully loaded with dry ice (20 kg) and opened less than 2 times per day for no longer than 5 minutes per opening, it can maintain ULT storage conditions for up to 5 days. Considerations in using manufacturer-supplied thermal shipping container as storageIndividual thermal shipping container must be returned within 30 days upon receipt of international delivery. The thermal shipping container can be used as temporary storage for the different vaccine formulations. Can be stored in thermal shipping container: Other commercial thermal shipping containers for dry ice may also be used to transport vaccine to subnational stores or to temporarily store vaccine under ULT conditions.Module 4 contains instructions on how to use other types of thermal shipping container for dry ice as a temporary storage for vaccine. Orientation on manufacturer-supplied temperature monitoring deviceEach thermal shipping container only includes one TMD, either: Monitoring of shipping container temperature by the manufacturer stops once the TMD is deactivated. Keep the deactivated TMD. It will be returned to the manufacturer along with the thermal shipping container after 30 days of receipt. If using the thermal shipping container as temporary storage, MOH is responsible for providing additional TMDs for continued monitoring of temperature during storage. Ensure the additional TMDs are securely and properly installed. Follow the manufacturer's instructions.Controlant Logger 10.01Controlant SAGA LoggerOR51New visual identifier for type of TMD used DO NOT bulk return Controlant SAGA Loggers and Controlant 10.01 Loggers.The two types of data loggers cannot be packed together for return due to Air Way Bill (AWB) differences between the two loggers. To facilitate bulk returns per TMD type, manufacturer added a new visual identifier to the medium and large ULT thermal shipping containers that indicates whether the container carries a SAGA data logger. 52Temperature Monitoring Device (TMD) Receiving InstructionsRegardless of Temperature Monitoring Device (TMD) model used in the vaccine shipment, to STOP the TMD to check for any temperature excursion during transport.Press and hold the \"stop\" button for five seconds to stop temperature monitoring. Shipment LED will then turn on for 3 seconds confirming the temperature monitoring has stopped.\u00fcIf the Alarm LED does not blink red and there is no black alarm icon on the display, no temperature deviation occurred. \u00fcIf the Alarm LED blinks red every five seconds and/or the black alarm icon is visible, a temperature excursion may have taken place.Once the \"stop\" button is pressed, the manufacturer is no longer monitoring the shipment of the product.Manufacturer will provide the temperature records of the shipment to the facility's designated focal point within 1-3 hours of stopping the TMD.Do not use the product until you have received the quality report from Controlant advising on further use.53If the temperature monitoring device is unable to connect with the cell network, manual upload is possible.The manual data process steps are the same for both Controlant 10.01 and/or Controlant SAGA loggers.The following steps allow Points of Use (POUs) to ensure proper data connection through a manual data upload using your local internet network.Manual data upload in cases without network connection Steps for manually uploading temperature data from the TMD:1.Connect the temperature monitoring device to a computer that has access to your local network. 2.Using the USB cable provided with the temperature monitoring device, manually upload the temperature monitoring data onto the computer. The data file will upload onto the computer in the form of a Bin file. 3.Once you have located the Bin file on your computer, manually upload this file onto https://upload.controlant.com/. 4.By manually uploading the data onto this website, this allows the data from the temperature monitoring device to reach the Pfizer Control Tower which helps to ensure supply chain visibility.5.Once the data is received at the Control Tower, a quality disposition report is created which documents quality considerations and identifies any suspected temperature excursion. 54 Resolving SAGA logger display error message Visual Display ErrorRegardless of the display error message, the end-user can still read the LED lights and press the \"Stop\" button to end temperature monitoring.If the physical display of the logger shows the display error (B), this means that the logger is outside of display operational temperature range.Once the logger is within the operating temperature range, some items (e.g., battery percentage, signal status, alarm icon, and shipping status) may not be present on the display (C) until the logger is plugged in to charge.55Resolving SAGA logger display error message No Impact Logger Functionality The display error message does not impact the logger functionality and the error only appears when the logger drops below 0\u00baC.Please refer to the quality disposition report for full product status. This report should be provided via email within 1-3 hours of pressing the stop button.Resolution: The display can be restored by plugging the logger in to charge. This fully recovers the display to show battery percentage, signal status, alarm icon, and shipping status (D). Handle and use dry ice in open space or well-ventilated area. If in doubt, use mechanical ventilation system and gas detectors. If working in a small area, ensure appropriate protective measures are available and door is kept open.

Never leave dry ice in the car or closed room for a long period of time due to risk of suffocation.35Safety considerations when handling dry iceOpen the thermal shipping container and leave it at room temperature in an open, well-ventilated area until it fully sublimates into carbon dioxide gas. It readily sublimates from solid to a gas state. DO NOT leave dry ice in an unsecured area. DO NOT place in drain or flush in toilet. DO NOT dispose in trash. DO NOT place in a closed area such as an airtight container or walk-in cooler.35Handling dry ice: safe disposalDry ice Thermal ShippingcontainerThermal shipping container used for dry ice can be disposed of in a local landfill that accepts hazardous waste products. Ensure container is empty before disposal. 59Re-icing the manufacturer-supplied thermal shipping containerRe-icing is the process of adding more dry ice to the thermal shipping containerThermal shipping container's cold life can be extended with regular re-icing. Never allow dry ice to completely sublimate before re-icing. Re-ice immediately when dry ice level is less than 1/3 of the container. Re-icing should be done every 5 days or more frequently if dry ice sublimation rate is faster. PreparationWear safety glasses with side shields or safety goggles and waterproof insulated gloves before performing the procedure.Ensure workspace is open and well-ventilated.Use dry ice in 10 mm to 16 mm pellet format to function appropriately. Other common formats (e.g. pucks) will not provide the same insulation and should not be used.CautionFeeling short of breath or developing a headache may be signs that you have inhaled too much carbon dioxide. Leave the area immediately to a place with fresh air. 60Re-icing the manufacturer-supplied thermal shipping container \u00a9 HZJZ Croatia and \u00a9 Republic of Congo MOHProcedures for re-icing1.Carefully open the foam lid with TMD. 2.Remove the dry ice pod.3.

Returning the manufacturer-supplied thermal shipping containerEnsure the dry ice \"UN1845\" label on the thermal shipping container is covered as it no longer contains dry ice. A blank sticker label is provided on the back page of the Shipping and Handling Guidelines for the thermal shipping container. This label must be covered upon return since the shipping container no longer has dry ice. \u00a9 HZJZ Croatia\u00a9 Republic of Congo MOHModule 4: Recommended cold chain equipment and vaccine deployment strategiesTarget audience: Decision-makers, supply chain officers and cold chain managersPfizer BioNTechCOVID-19 Vaccine COMIRNATY\u00ae (Tozinameran)7 February 202364The following slides present delivery strategies for Pfizer-BioNTechCOVID-19 vaccine. Countries can prioritize whom to vaccinate in line with the SAGE recommendations and their needs.These strategies are designed to observe the following principles:Minimize ultra-cold chain infrastructure requirements while allowing broader access and uptake of the vaccine without significant UCC investment; andReduce closed-vial wastage risk given the novelty of UCC products and stringent vaccine management requirement. This section covers three major areas:\u009fabasic single-site model with on-site administration;\u009fconsiderationswhen expanding to multiple UCC hubs, under exceptional circumstance;\u009fconsiderationswhen providing off-site administration.Cold chain and vaccine deployment strategies The ultra cold chain options: fast vs slowCascade deployment of vaccines from a central UCC hub to different subnational storage points with CCE for vaccine storage.Applicable to countries:Where districts are far from central storage.Archipelago or big countries with several layers of distribution points.There are two possible scenarios for establishing UCC hub(s).Rapid deployment of vaccine from a central UCC hub directly to service delivery points using appropriate transport, with or without temporary storage.Applicable to countries:Where districts are close to central storage.Small countries where districts are easily accessible using various transport means. Reminder:Storage at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C = 2 weeks maximum for purple cap. Not applicable for grey cap and orange cap.Storage at +2 to +8 \u00b0C = maximum of 31 days for purple cap and 10 weeks for grey cap and orange cap.The ultra cold chain options: fast vs slowThe selection of strategy for deployment of cold chain and vaccine should consider the type of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine formulations available in the supply chain. Visual aids should be made available for cold chain managers to ensure vaccines are stored and transported according to the recommended temperatures and transport considerations for each vaccine type.

Where vaccine is stored at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C, careful monitoring is required to avoid undue wastage. \u00a9 WHO/Christopher BlackCascading vaccine deployment Modus operandi:Vaccine can be distributed frozen at ULT or -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C or thawed at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C to strategically located subnational stores to be stored for a limited period.Subnational and district stores can repack vaccines in smaller quantities and distribute directly to lower distribution points/service points using WHO pre-qualified transport boxes with conditioned frozen water packs (if delivering thawed vaccine) or frozen water packs (if delivering vaccine frozen at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C).Freeze-preventive vaccine carrier with frozen water packs or vaccine carrier with conditioned frozen water packs can also be used to deliver vaccine at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C at service points. Date the vaccine was removed from ULT freezer or thermal shipping container and end date of the remaining shelf life at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C should be clearly marked on the vaccine trayboxesor cartons, documented in the shipping documents and communicated to recipient stores.\u00a9 WHO/Christopher BlackCascading vaccine deployment Modus operandi:Some or all vaccines can be transferred directly from thermal shipping containers to ULT freezer at the central store and be stored for a limited period. This vaccine supply can either be used to resupply the subnational UCC hubs with vaccine frozen at -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C and/or supply accessible districts and/or service points with vaccine stored either at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C or at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C.Some vaccine supply may be kept in thermal shipping containers with re-icing of dry ice upon receipt and every 5 days. This allows redistribution of vaccine maintained at -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C directly to the strategically located subnational UCC hubs.Then, this vaccine supply can be further distributed at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C or +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C temperature to the district stores and/or service points. Date the vaccine was removed from ULT freezer or shipping containers and end date of the remaining shelf life at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C should be clearly marked on the vaccine trayboxesor cartons, documented in the shipping documents and communicated to recipient stores. Thawed vaccines can be transported using WHO pre-qualified transport boxes with conditioned frozen water packs or cool water packs (depending on the ambient temperature and equipment holdover time). Scenario 2: Multiple UCC hubsCold chain system design:1 UCC storage hub at central store.Some strategically located UCC storage hubs at subnational level.Subnational storage hubs for -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C and/or +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C (use WHO pre-qualified freezer and fridges for storage).Use of WHO pre-qualified insulated passive containers for +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C storage at service facilities.\u00a9 WHO/Christopher BlackCascading vaccine deployment Advantages: Cost effective as UCC investment is limited to central store and strategically located areas. Maximizing the existing dual temperature storage capacity (-25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C and +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C) at lower store levels, depending on available Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine formulations in the supply chain.Presence of freezer at subnational/district stores would allow purple cap vaccine to be delivered frozen at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C, eliminating the risk of transport stress if delivered at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C.Disadvantages:Slow vaccine distribution mechanism. Risk of further reducing shelf life if vaccine stays longer at subnational stores before reaching service points. Requires careful tracking of vaccine movement, remaining shelf life and storage temperature at service points. May yield higher transport cost due to several layers of deliveries. May yield vaccine wastage due to heat exposure during storage/transport.\u00a9 WHO/Christopher BlackRapid vaccine deploymentSingle UCC hub supplying to +8\u00b0C Cold chain system design:1 UCC storage hub at central store.Use of existing +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C storage capacity at service facilities (use WHO pre-qualified equipment).refrigerators; orcold boxes (as temporary storage). If the receiving facility has vaccine refrigerator, the vaccine can be stored at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C until the end of the remaining shelf life. This will enable health workers to carry out multiple vaccination sessions. If the receiving facility does not have a refrigerator, the vaccine can be kept at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C in cold boxes with conditioned frozen water packs for few days (always check the product's shelf life at this storage temperature). If the service point is within short travel distance from the central store, the vaccine can be delivered in vaccine carrierswith conditioned frozen water packs or cool water packs (depending on the ambient temperature and equipment holdover time)for immediate use in a vaccination session. Modus operandi:Vaccine can be transferred from thermal shipping containers directly to ULT freezer at the central store.Once service facility is ready to implement the vaccination activity, central store thaws the required quantity of vaccine to be delivered at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C directly to service points. Another option for purple cap vaccine is to deliver it frozen at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C (especially if travel time is longer than 48 hours) and thawing starts upon receipt of the vaccine at service points.Rapid vaccine deployment Advantages: Cost-saving as UCC investment is limited to central store. Support rapid vaccine distribution to service facilities and avoiding storage burden on subnational and district levels. Enabling potentially high vaccine consumption and low wastage as vaccine will be delivered by demand. This means sessions are planned around the expected vaccine delivery period. Shelf life is maximized as vaccine is stored in ULT freezer and will be thawed only as needed. May save on transport cost due to skipping of several store levels. Promotes strong coordination between national and service facility for planning vaccination sessions around the time of delivery. Enables effective monitoring of vaccine deliveries, uptake and wastage. Disadvantages:Thawed purple cap vaccine is at risk of transportation stress if travel time to service points takes more than 48 hours. Requires careful tracking of vaccine movement, remaining shelf life and storage temperature at service points.Requires robust system for monitoring and recording vaccine supply and movement. Setting up UCC hubs at first subnational level: conditions According to WHO/UNICEF technical guidance, a UCC hub is recommended primarily for central level vaccine store.For some special cases, establishing UCC hub at first subnational level may be supported IF the following strategic and operational considerations are satisfied, which will ensure sustained functionality of ULT freezers and UCC system infrastructure.\u00fcWith extraordinary challenges making storage of vaccine in a freezer or refrigerator impossible.\u00fcThe UCC hub is strategically located in a geographical area so that it can efficiently supply quality vaccine to other local vaccine stores or service points.\u00fcDecision is based on evidence (and included in the NDVP) that such UCC hub will increase access and coverage in the specified geographical area.\u00fcProof that staff that will manage the UCC hub have necessary specialized technical and operational skills.ULT freezer installation at district and service delivery levels are not recommended and should not be pursued. The lower the levels, the higher the risk of closed-vial wastage due to less reliable electricity and expert support, among others. Setting up UCC hubs at first subnational level: operational considerationsa.ULT freezer is installed in air-conditioned room where the temperature never exceeds 30C and is protected from direct sunlight.b.All ULT freezer and air conditioners are connected to a dedicated constant power supply, a backup generator with automatic switch over, UPS, and adequate fuel supply. This must be verified by qualified electrician.c.Each ULT freezer is equipped with remote temperature monitoring device (RTMD), monitored by the national vaccine store 24/7, as well as ULT 30-day TMD with data download capability. Data should be submitted to the national vaccine store daily.d.Each UCC is equipped with an adequate voltage stabilizer.e.Properly trained health worker is available 24/7 to monitor of internal temperature daily and supervise packing and unpacking of ULT vaccines. f.If ULT phase change material (PCM) is used as coolant pack for vaccine distribution, a separate UCC should be available for freezing of PCM packs. g.If dry ice is used as coolant, ensure secured supply of dry ice that will allow replenishment every 5 days.h.Officially approved technician is available to: Clean condenser filter on compressor units and vacuum breaker/relief port on all units monthly.

Temperature display (actual and set point).High/low temperature alarms, possibly with remote monitoring.Open door and power failure alarms.Require stable and continuous electricity supply.Require air-conditioned room for efficient operation (working ambient temperature at< 30\u00b0C).Require large floor space for installation and handling.Strategic location, such as near an open/well-ventilated area to allow ease of loading vaccines into shipping containers for transport and distribution, especially when using dry ice.Insulated gloves for safe working with ultra-low temperatures.Training on installation, management and maintenance.ULT vaccine: central and hub storage options Photo: WHO \u00a9 WHO/Magnus Manske *80\u009fEnsure that there is sufficient secondary UCC capacity to allow periodic defrosting of equipment. In most settings, a single additional freezer (or temporary use of the shipper) will be sufficient to allow sequential rotation and defrosting.\u009fEnsure that the site meets all readiness requirements described in this module and the product specifications provided by the manufacturer. A single unattended power fluctuation could permanently damage the UCC freezer and place stored vaccine doses at risk.A single unattended open-door event could place stored vaccine doses at risk.The local power system should provide an uninterrupted electricity supply with stable required parameters, which can be achieved with the main grid plus backup through standby generators and/or other uninterrupted power systems (e.g. solar generators, battery banks, etc.).\u009fWherever possible, prepare a contingency plan for vaccine storage. In most contexts, this would be access to an emergency delivery of dry ice allowing transfer of the vaccine from a ULT freezer to the thermal shipping containers. \u009fThe vaccine and PCM packs should not be stored in the same freezer. If ArktekTMYBC-5E is used for transportation, a separate ULT freezer is required to freeze PCM packs. Considerations when using ULT freezersDescription of ULT freezer ULT freezers are different compared with the standard EPI freezers (-25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C). ULT freezers operate at extremely low temperatures. Workers are required to wear PPE, especially long-sleeved insulated gloves (cryogenic gloves). ULT freezers are very sensitive to the ambient temperature, which can affect their ability to maintain ultra-low temperatures. They should be housed in an air-conditioned area to keep the ambient temperature under 30\u00b0C. ULT freezers generate a large amount of heat which adds to the ambient temperature and therefore increases the workload and decreases thermal unit efficiency of the air conditioner.Because their operating temperature is far below normal ambient temperatures, they have very short \"holdover time\" until they reach -60\u00b0C.They have powerful refrigeration systems; therefore, when running at -86\u00b0C their power consumption is higher than regular vaccine freezers, especially when the door is open. In some models, the power consumption of a single 700-L ULT freezer is equivalent to a 20-m\u00b3 walk-in cold room (WICR). @ Republic of Congo MOH @ Republic of Congo MOH\u00a9 WHO/Christopher BlackDescribe ULT equipment and TMD optionsULT freezers are heavy and bulky. They should be handled carefully when they are moved or transported.One manufacturer uses a new piston Stirling motor technology, which requires less maintenance and uses less power compared with cascading compressor systems. This piston Stirling motor does not have the cycle start/stop operation of a compressor system and therefore does not have fluctuating power consumption (spikes) during steady state running. Some ULT freezer models can be adjusted to operate at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C, which would be an advantage, permitting their continued use in routine health service delivery after the COVID-19 pandemic. This increases the value for money of the ULT investment.Most ULT freezers are supplied with a built-in temperature monitor and an external control panel with temperature reading and alarms. Most have the capability to provide temperature logs via a USB port. 30-day temperature recorders for ULT freezers are also now available (although they are not yet WHO pre-qualified certified) such as the Fridge-tag Ultra Low from Berlingerand the UTREL30-16 from LogTag.Both models have USB UCC freezers Link: https://www.360medical.ca/collections/80-celsius-ultra-low-temp-freezersULT freezer hot 43\u00b0CPower: V/50 Hz or 220 V/60 Hz ULT Freezer in hot zone up to 43\u00b0CPower: 230 V/50 Hz or 220 freezer -86\u00b0C to -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0CPower: 110-240 V and 12 V DC Stirling freezer -86\u00b0C to Link: https://www.stirlingultracold.com/ult-freezers/ULT freezer selection criteria and key considerationsVaccine should be kept in its original packaging when stored in ULT freezer, which limits the storage space available for vaccine. It is not recommended to store the vaccine in primary packaging (e.g. vial) into the ULT freezer at the UCC hub.\u00fcVials must be kept frozen and protected from light, in the original carton, until ready to use.\u00fcUnopened frozen vaccine should not be exposed to ambient temperature for more than 5 minute.\u00fcDynamic labelling has to be done on the secondary packaging. The doses allocated may not represent the peak volume required for storage. Allocation may increase according to country needs and the availability of doses. While Pfizer reported vaccine volume per dose in secondary packaging appears small, there is a large amount of unusable storage space in the ULT freezers once the vaccine is stored due to the size of the trayboxesor cartons that hold the vials.Each ULT freezer model can store a different amount of Pfizer doses. Determine which volume category of ULT freezer is required based on calculation of required capacity.Consider including surge storage capacity (e.g. extra storage space) that can accommodate possible future increase in storage volume requirement.Formula for calculating ULT freezer storage capacityThe freezer capacity is calculated in litres. 1000 is the conversion ratio from cm3(volume per dose) to L. To ensure adequate space is available for storing vaccine in ULT freezers, the following multiplication factors are recommended for calculating required storage capacity:195-vial trayboxesand 10-vial carton (grey x 4 cm3 \u00f71000 = required ULT freezer storage space in liter.10-vial cap, includingVCV doses x 3 cm3 \u00f71000 = required ULT freezer storage space in liter.Countries are encouraged to:communicate with the supplier and obtain packaging information ahead of the delivery to determine if there is sufficient ULT freezer capacity to store the incoming vaccine supply, and develop a contingency plan in case there is a shortage of ULT storage.ULT freezer selection criteria and key considerations2. Required space for installation of ULT freezerConsider selecting units with the smallest footprint per liter storage space required. Chest-type freezers generally have a larger footprint than upright freezers.Calculate the space requirement when planning to install multiple ULT freezers in the same location so that there is at least 0.5 m free space around each ULT freezer. This is necessary to enable hot air emission to escape. Some models may allow placement against a wall and some models may have the hot air escaping at the top of the ULT freezer.The room that will house the ULT freezers should have entrance door big enough to bring in the ULT freezers for installation.Identify a location for the installation of ULT freezer that is not directly exposed to sunlight/heat source. Install an appropriate number and type of air conditioning unit that can consistently keep the ambient temperature below 30\u00b0C.ULT freezer selection criteria and key considerations3. Required power supplySelect a ULT freezer model with power voltage (V) and frequency that match the specifications of local power supply.The local power system should provide an uninterrupted electricity supply with stable required parameters, which can be achieved with the main grid plus backup through standby generators and/or other uninterrupted power systems (e.g. solar generators, battery banks, etc.).Select a model which has built in multi-voltage power supply capability if your country needs both 110/115 V and 220/230 V. It is also possible to order a ULT freezer with stand-alone voltage stabilizer appropriate for 110 V/50/60 Hz.ULT freezer selection criteria and key considerations4. Power consumptionSelect a model with the lowest power consumption (kWh/day) to reduce the size of the required backup generator and operation cost.Consider a model that reduces the demand placed on the power supply. Note that the increased power demand during start up occurs only once at initial start-up for the Stirling piston pump models whereas for the cascading compression models each cycle uses increased power.5. Required maintenanceConsider model that comes with a supplier's guarantee for maintenance.Select ULT freezer model similar to the existing ULT freezers for ease of use and maintenance. Select models that would require less maintenance (such as changing filters, replacement of parts, etc.).ULT freezer selection criteria and key considerations6. Required climate zoneSelect ULT freezers that has been tested for the ambient temperatures that fall within your country's climate zone. This can help increase the resilience of the ULT freezer in case of a power failure or air conditioner failure.Sustained air conditioning at the installation site is crucial for proper functioning of any ULT freezer.The ambient/hot zone temperature categorization as applied for regular freezer does not apply to UCC because they are not tested under these conditions.ULT freezer selection criteria and key considerations7. Review ULT freezer holdover time (warm-up time) Holdover time is not used in ULT freezer specifications -it is normally referred to as warm-up time. Different ULT freezers available for the emergency use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine have varying holdover (warm-up) time at different ambient temperatures. Holdover (warm-up) time will differ if tested empty or filled so carefully check the holdover time for each ULT freezer as indicated in the UNICEF long-term agreement (LTA) list. When the door is open these warm-up times are very much shorter than when the door is closed due to the massive temperature differential between -86\u00b0C and +30\u00b0C.Review manufacturers information on holdover (warm-up) time when selecting an appropriate ULT equipment to be installed in each UCC hub. This will give you an indication of the time available for restoring power in the unlikely event that the auto switch over between the generator and mains malfunctions.ULT freezer selection criteria and key considerationsWhen procuring a portable ULT freezer, check if the unit is supplied with a 12 V DC adaptor, which can provide for a 12 V battery backup. Note that 12 V is not enough to supply the amount of power required to support a ULT freezer pull down to -86\u00b0C, but it can easily support steady state operation at -86\u00b0C set point. To support a pull-down from a warmer temperature to -86\u00b0C, maximum power is required and should be supplied from main power/generator before it is connected to 12 V DC. ULT freezer selection criteria and key considerations8. Required temperature monitoring systemMost ULT freezer models are tested for hot or temperate zones are delivered with USB ports to allow downloading of data. It is recommended that a remote temperature monitoring device (RTMD) with alarm is installed in each ULT freezer. RTMD can be ordered separately, as needed.9. Dual temperature functionalityULT freezers models are available in different temperature ranges (either -20\u00b0C to -86\u00b0C, -40\u00b0C to -86\u00b0C, or -60\u00b0C to-86\u00b0C).Consider selecting a ULT freezer model that can operate at a wide range of freezing temperature (i.e. a unit that can freeze at -86\u00b0C and -20\u00b0C) to allow flexibility in use in the health care setting, especially if ULT storage is no longer necessary. \u00a9 WHO/Christopher BlackUNICEF-SD LTA ULT equipment list 10 hrs to -20\u00b0C at R290 (135g +/- 12 hrs to -20\u00b0C at 25\u00b0C R170 typeCooling performanceInternal temperature range Medium volume category 300 < 600 L Large volume category 600 < 900 L PortableSmall volume category 80 < 300 L\u00a9 WHO/Christopher BlackUNICEF-SD LTA ULT equipment list (2/3) Ultra-low Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 VaccineMicroproccessor controlledWith digital desplayWith data downloading/USB portNumber of boxes (secondary packaging) with232 x 232 x 40 mm external dimensions to be storedTotal number vials (195 vials/secondary packaging) to be storedTotal number of vaccine doses to be stored (6 doses per vial)Freezer available for 220-240V/50Hzsingle phaseFreezer available for110V/60Hzsingle phaseQingdao LtdYesYesYesYesYes28546032 LtdYesYesYesYesYes40780046 800YesNoNo YesYesNo Qingdao Haier Biomedical Cooling Inc./Stirling UltracoldYesYesYesYesNo713658190YesYesYesManufacturer/supplierControllerPfizer vaccine storage capacity (estimation of freezer Electricity supply requirement\u00a9 WHO/Christopher BlackUNICEF-SD LTA ULT equipment list (3/3) Ultra-low storing Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 VaccinePower consumptionEnergy consumption Running currentSupplied with voltage sets of cryo glovesUnit price (equipment)CurrencyFCA delivery pointManufacturer lead time Co., Ltd680 W5.5 KWh/24h3AYesNoYesYes3008.32USDFCA KW13 chain managersPfizer BioNTechCOVID-19 Vaccine COMIRNATY\u00ae (Tozinameran)7 February 2023 @ Republic of Congo MOHSummary of considerations when planning and managing a UCC system1.Existing cold chain situation:Functionality of existing cold chain equipment, available types of coolant packs and TMDs. 2.UCC hub infrastructure:Power supply, air-conditioning, safe workspace for handling dry ice, available equipment to produce and store coolant packs.3.Information management system:Ability to monitor storage temperature, trace vaccine movement, monitor expiration date/shelf life, wastage and utilization. 4.Continuous power supply:Dedicated power transformer, safe electrical installations, available backup generator, automatic transfer switch (ATS) set up. 5.Human resource capacity:Staff are available, trained and with clear roles and responsibilities for running the UCC hub, including stock, logistics, supply distribution, etc.6.Operations safety and personal protective equipment:Cryogenic/insulated gloves, safety goggles, face shield and respirator.7.Shipping requirements and Customs clearance:Assignment of responsible staff, secured import permits for ULT equipment, preparation of all documents to facilitate release from Customs, and organizing transport of ULT equipment to area of installation. 8.Warehousing and distribution:Clear plan, including installation and sustainability of UCC system, availability of mechanical lifters for very heavy ULT freezers.9.Vaccine transport equipment and logistics:Clear SOP and compliance with recommended standards for transport and distribution up to service points.1. Existing cold chain situation Updated inventory of existing cold chain capacity and equipment status at different storage temperature and per administrative level.Availability of equipment for preparing and storing coolant packs.Key considerations: planning and managing the UCC system Use existing fridges and freezers for preparing coolant packs to deliver vaccine at -25C to -15C and +2C to +8C. PCM packs and dry ice cannot be stored in the same ULT freezer used for vaccine.Additional equipment needed at UCC hub based on coolant packs used: Smaller ULT freezer for preparing and storing ULT PCM packs, or Dry ice machine. Think about: What vaccine formulations are available in the supply chain?How the vaccine will be stored and delivered to the last mile? What are optimal storage points at central, intermediate, and service delivery levels and the delivery route to the storage points and vaccination sites?Key considerations: planning and managing the UCC system 2. UCC hub infrastructureAvailability of continuous power supply to ensure optimal functioning of ULT freezers.Appropriate air-conditioning system in the room with ULT freezers.Availability of temperature monitoring devices.Facility's physical set up allows optimal functioning of the ULT equipment and safe handling of vaccine and coolant packs.Equipment for producing/storing coolant packs, including dry ice.3. Logistics information management systemElectronic logistics management information system is recommended.System should consider peculiarity of the vaccine and should include data such as: temperature monitoring vaccine traceability monitoring of expiration date/shelf and wastage rate.\u00a9 WHO/Mark Nieuwenhof4. Continuous power supplyTo ensure continuous electric power supply to the ULT freezer, the following requirements should be fulfilled:Power transformer dedicated to the installation site or facility (if possible).All power and lighting circuits including sockets and grounding must be in a safe condition, tested and approved to national standards by a qualified engineer or electrician.Power circuits serving refrigeration equipment must be rated to suit the required refrigeration loads including ancillary electrical equipment (fans, air-conditioners, light fittings, etc.) should have no significant electrical or mechanical defects.Availability of backup generator with automatic start-up functionality and is connected to a standby uninterrupted power supply (UPS) for the generator lag time before it starts.Set up automatic transfer switch (ATS) to ensure equipment will automatically switch back and forth between mains power supply and backup generator in case of power interruption. Compliance with recommended emergency and routine maintenance of the backup power sources.Contingency plan in case of power failure.Key considerations: planning and managing the UCC system 5. Human resource capacity Each UCC hub should have, at minimum, a cold chain technician and 2 assistants (1 for handling vaccine and 1 for handling ULT PCM or dry ice).Ensure staff at the national and subnational UCC hubs are properly trained to manage the day-to-day operations, including:Supply and inventory management;Monitoring storage temperature and tracking of shelf life, including dynamic labelling;Vaccine allocation and dispatch;Preparation and dispatch coolant packs (dry ice, PCM packs or water packs) and transport containers; and Using appropriate TMD when transporting vaccine in cold boxes and vaccine carriers.Key considerations: planning and managing the UCC system 6. Operations safety and personal protective equipment (PPE)Availability and accessibility of appropriate personal protective equipment.PPE when handling ULT freezers and dry ice: cryogenic/insulated gloves (to avoid frostbite when handling conditioned ArktekTMand to protect from contact with PCM liquid).Respirator mask to avoid inhalation of lithium chloride from PCM liquid. 7. Shipping requirementsInternational Air Transport Association (IATA) has restrictions on the amount of flammable refrigerant loaded in each equipment and therefore most models of ULT freezers cannot be transported by air and will have to be delivered by sea. Even when allowed by air, there is significant impact on the shipment cost as ULT equipment are voluminous and heavy. The height of the ULT freezer could be a constraint as not all models are allowed by the manufacturer to be transported horizontally. Only few manufacturers produce chest-type ULT freezers. Early planning and coordination are critical to facilitate air or sea transport to save cost and minimize impact on planned campaign implementation. Selecting the appropriate mode of transport based on the UCC freezer model is a joint decision of the recipient country, UNICEF SD and the freight forwarder. Key considerations: planning and managing the UCC system 8. Customs clearance Countries are responsible for Customs clearance upon arrival of the ULT equipment at the port of entry. The provision of import permits in the shortest time possible is important for efficient deployment of the equipment. Countries should ensure the following are in place to facilitate shipment and delivery:Assign a responsible staff member to manage the receipt, clearance and transport of the ULT equipment. Identify a decision-making official that can provide immediate intervention in case of challenges/delays with Customs clearance. Agreement with Customs and regulatory authorities to provide import permits (waiver) for ULT equipment. Prepare all documentation requirements for Customs clearance before arrival of the shipment to facilitate immediate release of the equipment and transport to central warehouse. Key considerations: planning and managing the UCC system 9. Warehousing and distributionEngage existing logistics working group to support MOH in planning and implementing a UCC system.Select a supply chain design that is suitable to address needs and local context.Consider organizing trainings/workshops for supply chain personnel at different levels to ensure smooth operations and minimize vaccine supply deviations.10. Vaccine transport equipment and logisticsFollow WHO and manufacturers' guidelines on distributing and transporting vaccine to ensure vaccine potency up to the service points.

Coolant materials material (PCM) is a substance which releases/absorbs sufficient energy at phase transition to provide useful heating/cooling. Melting point of different PCM types vary. Material used in the coolant packs are considered PCMs. Each PCM maintains a constant temperature during transition. As the PCM melts it absorbs heat without increasing in temperature until it has all turned into liquid. This helps keep the vaccines within their optimum temperature range throughout the PCM transition. The amount of energy required to melt a PCM (latent heat) combined with the effectiveness of the insulation container (the heat leak at any given ambient temperature) determines the cold life.*What is phase change material (PCM)?PCM examples: traditional cold chain Water/ice packsPhase change temperature: 0.5\u00b0CLatent heat of phase change: 335 kJ/kgMethod: fill packs with water and freeze at -1\u00b0C or lower Uses: packing vaccines for vaccination session, maintaining vaccines cool during transportation or sessionSuitable containers:vaccine carrierstransport boxesthermal change temperature: of phase change: 571 kJ/kg\u009fMethod: produced (by dry-ice machine) or procured (from local sources)\u009fStorage: at -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C using ULT freezer or special insulated container\u009fUse: packing vaccines for transport and temporary storage\u009fTransport containers options:thermal shipping container for dry ice (with \"UN1845\" marking);locally available insulated containers (shorter cold life, less durable, may require more frequent re-icing). \u00a9 WHO/Mark NieuwenhofSpecial PCM for phase change: 115 kJ/kg \u009fDensity: 880 kg/m3\u009fMethod: freeze 16 packs (2 sets of 8 packs) at -80\u00b0C for minimum 24 hours \u009fUse: packing vaccines for transport and temporary storage\u009fSuitable containers:ArktekTMwith Transporting ULT frozen vaccine to subnational storesTarget audience: Supply chain officers and cold chain COMIRNATY\u00ae (Tozinameran)7 February coolantDescriptionRequirementsArktekTM(YBC-5E) long-duration passive ultra coolerSpecial ULT PCMDurable material, with designed with ULT PCM (frozen at -80\u00b0C)last for 5 days without PCM replacement with multiple openingRemaining PCM material can be re-usedInitial high investment cost Relatively bulky and not transport ergonomicWhen used with PCM:\u00a7Each ArktekTMrequires total of 16 metal PCM packs to prepare for ULT storage (8 for pre-conditioning of ArktekTMand 8 for storage/transport)\u00a7Separate ULT freezer for freezing and storing PCM\u00a7Wear protective long sleeves, face shield, gloves and respirator (to avoid inhalation of lithium chloride from PCM liquid)\u00a7PCM for ULT is corrosive to plastic material.

Wear PPE (respirator mask and face shield) during handling.Shake first the liquid PCM in the container. Remove the screw cover of the metal PCM packs with the use of a tool provided with the equipment. With the use of a metal funnel, fill each metal pack with 1 liter (L)of liquid PCM.Fortify the screws with white tape to prevent leakage before putting it back to cover the PCM packs. For initial use, 16 PCM packs must be filled. These will be reusable. Once all 16 PCM packs are filled proceed with the PCM freezing process. 1. Vaccine cup stacks2. Insulative vacuum space3. Removable access cap4. Protective Good/Intellectual ArktekTMwith 24 hrs2. Freezing the PCM packsThe overall process requires the use of up to 16 PCM packs (two sets of 8 packs) and a dedicated ULT freezer for PCM. DO NOT freeze PCM in ULT freezer for vaccines.Procedures for freezing PCM packs:1.Prechill the PCM-dedicated ULT freezer if applicable).2.Then, transfer the PCM to pre-chilled ULT freezer for conditioning to -86\u00b0C.Make sure the plug surface is facing up to prevent leakage of the liquid PCM. Allow 5-10 cm of space between PCM packs for more rapid freezing. Freeze only 16 PCM packs at a time. 3.Leave the PCM packs in the ULT freezer for at least 48 hours to ensure they are fully frozen.DO not put additional PCM packs in liquid state until the ULT freezer temperature is below -84\u00baC to allow full freezing of new packs. 4.Confirm PCM packs are fully frozen using appropriate temperature monitoring equipment. Fully frozen PCM cannot be confirmed by shaking the packs or by appearance.

Transfer frozen PCM packs from ULT freezer to ArktekTMquickly to avoid warming of packs. Practice loading the ArktekTMusing unfrozen PCM packs. Ensure plug surface is facing up to prevent leakage once PCM starts to melt. Keep the first set of PCM packsin the ArktekTMfor 4 hours or more for proper conditioning.Once temperature reached -80\u00b0C, replace PCM pack with a fully frozen set. Return the first set of PCM to ULT freezer for re-freezing and reuse. Placing the last block may be difficult. Lower it in with the flat side down and rest it on the tray at the base of the device. Then lift and tilt it into place. \u00a9 Global Good/Intellectual Ventures5. Loading the ArktekTMVaccine vials are stored in especially designed large and small interlocking containers, which can be combined in different stack configurations. Three of these container stacks can be loaded side-by-side inside the ArktekTM. Keep all vaccines and containers within a chilled space while loading vaccine vials into the container, Practice manipulating the containers, including securing the stack configuration using the twist-to-lock mechanism. Load the three stacks into the ArktekTMin this sequence: 1.Insert the first stack and slide it to the side. 2.Insert the next stack and slide it to the side opposite of the first stack. 3.Insert the remaining stack in the center between the other two stacks. 4.Put batteries into the temperature monitoring device. 5.Activate the TMD only when ArktekTMis used. Minimize vaccine exposure to ambient temperature to less than 3 minutes. Vaccine stays in ULT without replacement of frozen PCM for up to 5 days.Preparing the ArktekTMwith transport/storage >24H Ventures of Choice of coolantDescriptionRequirementsOther commercial thermal shipping containersDry ice onlyUse only commercial thermal shipping container labelled for dangerous goods/ dry ice (\"UN1845\" marking).Usually come with an outer carton and an inner styrofoambox.Some products may come with built-in temperature monitoring device and vial rack system.

Thaw only the number of vials needed to reach target.Thawed unopened vaccine vials can be kept at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C for up to 31 days (purple cap) or up to 10 weeks (grey cap and orange cap) -DISCARD vaccine if not used within the specified period and temperature conditions.Keep diluents (purple cap and orange cap) on the same temperature as the vaccine (+ 2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C ).Make sure vaccine is marked with an updated expiration date based on when the vaccine is taken out of ULT storage. Use first the vaccine vials thawed earlier. Managing vaccine cold chain: facility-based session \u00a9 HZJZ CroatiaKeep the vaccine label dry and intact. If label is peeled off or is unreadable, do not use. Document and mark for discard. Replenish conditioned frozen water packs mid session or as needed. Facility-based vaccination has the advantage of having easy access to supply of conditioned frozen water packs.The management of diluted vaccine (purple cap and orange cap) in a facility-based service delivery is same as the outreach. Document and report logistics information, including usage and wastage.131 Unopened vaccine stored in WHO pre-qualified vaccine carrierKeep the unopened vaccine vials and diluent in the WHO pre-qualified vaccine carrier with properly conditioned frozen water packs and temperature monitoring device (if available). Open vaccine carrier only to take out a vial to be used. At the same time check temperature and condition of water packs.Replace the conditioned frozen water packs as needed, especially when ambient temperature rises.Opened/diluted vaccine stored in regular vaccine carrier*Dilute one vial at a time and write the time of dilution on the label.Opened/diluted vaccine can be handled in room-light condition at temperatures not exceeding 30\u00b0C. AVOID direct exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light. Place opened/diluted vaccine on the foam pad of a separate vaccine carrier with conditioned frozen water packs for ease of access. Keep cooled at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C while in use.Discard unused vaccine 6 hours after opening/dilution or at the end of the immunization session, whichever comes first. \u00a9 WHO/Lindsay MackenzieManaging vaccine cold chain: community outreach session High-density vaccine carrier has longer cold life than regular vaccine carrier.*Grey cap vaccine does NOT need to be diluted. It is ready to use.132Conditioning frozen water packsFrozen water packs are correctly conditioned when it has melted enough to allow ice to move inside the packs. There is risk of refreezing vaccine if conditioning is not done properly. Wrapping vaccines in newspaper or other materials does not protect against freezing.Procedure: 1.Remove the required number of frozen ice packs from the freezer compartment. The number and type of pack required is shown on the inside of the lid of the cold box or vaccine carrier. 2.Lay the frozen ice packs on a work surface in a single layer leaving gaps of about 5 cm between packs. 3.Wait until all packs are properly conditioned.There must be liquid water inside every pack and the ice-cores should move inside the packs when shaken.This will take at least 30-45 minutes in hot weather and much longer in cooler conditions (90-120 minutes at +20\u00b0C). Always check if ice pack is properly conditioned before loading vaccine.Except where cool water packs are used, WHO recommends the use of \"conditioned\" ice packs for transporting vaccines in cold boxes and vaccine carriers.
