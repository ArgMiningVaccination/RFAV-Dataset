Listen to your body. If you have questions about diet, sexual activity, medications, disability or anything else, talk them over with your physician. Remember: Most patients receiving radiation therapy continue to do whatever they did before. They go to work or school and take care of their families. However, you will need more rest and should maintain healthy eating habits. The following guidelines will help protect your skin during radiation therapy: - If your skin is marked with a dye, do not wash the marks off. They are necessary for accurate treatment from one visit to the next. - Keep the skin dry in the area being treated. - You may rinse the treatment area with plain water. Using a soft cloth, pat dry. - Do not use soap in the treatment area. - Do not massage or rub the treated area vigorously. - Do not apply ointments, creams, lotions, talcum powders, alcohol, deodorants, anti-perspirants, perfumes, make-up or after-shave lotions in the treatment area unless prescribed by your physician. These products may intensify a skin reaction. - Mild shampoos may be used. - You may use aquaphor, a soothing gel. Ask your doctor if it must be cleaned off before treatment.) - Do not apply hot packs, heating pads, water bottles, saunas or sun lamps to the skin being treated. - Avoid cold. Do not expose the skin to ice bags or air conditioning vents. - Avoid exposing the treatment area to direct sunshine. - Do not put any dressings or tape of any kind on the treatment area unless prescribed by your doctor in the Radiation Oncology Department. If you have an open sore in your treatment area, your nurse will help you cover it with a dressing for protection. Do not use adhesive tape. Paper tape is recommended. - If shaving is necessary in the treatment area, use only an electric razor with no skin preparation. - Prevent rubbing of clothes or dressings on the skin as much as possible. Avoid harsh fabrics in the treatment area. Wear clothing with high cotton content; it allows the skin to breathe. If you are receiving radiation in the pelvic area, do not wear pantyhose. - Use gentle detergents to wash clothing that come in contact with the treatment area. - After the entire treatment is finished, a mild hand cream containing lanolin or 100 percent pure aloe vera gel may be used to relieve dryness and irritation. Do not use scented or medicated lotions. Cornstarch may also be used to relieve itching. Skin feel should begin to improve about two weeks after the final treatment. - Your doctor will advise you about skin care and, if necessary, will prescribe special ointments and creams or other medications. The importance of maintaining good nutrition is a vital part of medical care for individuals with cancer. Nutrients are the basic ingredients that cells, tissues and organs in the body require to reproduce, maintain and repair themselves. The body requires nutrients - protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, trace minerals and water on a regular basis and in proper amounts to function effectively. Your physician or nurse may recommend that you meet with a dietitian while you are receiving radiation therapy or before you start your treatment. Dietitians on staff at the Department of Radiation Oncology are registered members of the American Dietetic Association and licensed in the state of Missouri. They specialize in the medical nutrition therapy for patients diagnosed with cancer. A registered dietitian can assist you with the following: - General nutrition counseling - Assessment of individual nutritional needs - Suggestions for coping with side effects of cancer treatment - Use of nutritional supplements - Prevention of weight loss - Healthy weight management - Information on the role of diet and nutrition in reducing cancer risk If you would like to meet with a dietitian, please notify your physician, nurse, or therapist.

Side effects Many patients experience some side effects during radiation therapy. Your physician will talk to you about the expected reactions of your treatment. If you are worried about possible side effects or are having a symptom you feel may be related to your treatment, discuss this with your physician or nurse. Some patients who are treated in the neck area feel a sensation like a lump in the throat. Patients treated to the chest may have a cough, increased bronchial secretions and some difficulty swallowing. This will clear a few weeks after you finish your course of treatment. It is not unusual to feel tired during the course of radiation therapy. Many patients find it helpful to take an afternoon nap and to get an extra hour or so of sleep each night. Your body is your best guide. Most patients will not lose their hair. If the area receiving radiation has hair, it may be lost temporarily. Treatment-site-specific concerns and recommendations Nausea If you have nausea, try to eat small, frequent meals of bland, dry foods. You should drink liquids about an hour before or an hour after you eat. If possible, you should try to avoid cooking areas when you are nauseated. Your radiation oncologist will prescribe anti-nausea medication if necessary. Diarrhea A common side effect of radiation therapy to the abdomen is diarrhea. You may need need to decrease the amount of fiber in your diet. Your nurse will give you information about diet to help you minimize problems with diarrhea. Avoid raw fruits and vegetables, stimulants such as coffee or tea, raw seeds, gassy or greasy foods, and milk products. It is important that you drink 2 to 3 quarts of fluids every day when you have diarrhea to keep you from getting dehydrated. Jello, colas and Gatorade are good choices. Check with your radiation oncologist or nurse before using any over-the-counter medications. You may require a prescription medication to help control diarrhea. Other bowel and bladder discomfort Occasionally, patients will feel burning, itching, pain or other discomfort during a bowel movement. Please report any discomfort to a member of your treatment team. Medications can be ordered to help lessen these symptoms. Do not apply creams or lotions to the irradiated area. A member of your treatment team can advise you about skin care. Radiation therapy to the abdomen can cause some discomfort to the bladder.

Sexual activity During your course of treatment, you may notice changes in your sexual desire or performance. These changes vary greatly from one person to another. We encourage you to discuss your concerns with your radiation oncologist or nurse. Hair loss Hair loss is a side effect of radiation therapy to the brain. Your hair will begin to thin and fall out after the first week or two of treatment. New hair growth should be visible three to six months after radiation treatments end. If the dose of radiation is high, however, hair loss will be permanent. To protect your scalp from the sun or cold, you should wear a hat, scarf or wig when outside. If you wish to purchase a wig, you should do so before treatment. It will be easier to match your own hair color and preferred style. Some health insurance policies will cover the cost of a wig. Your doctor can also give you a prescription for the wig. The Cancer Information Center also has wigs available. You should wear your wig only on special occasions. It is better for your skin if you expose it to air when you are not outside. Check with the nurse about the use of a mild soap or shampoo for your hair. Do not dye your hair or get a permanent at this time. After you lose your hair, use warm water only on your scalp. Pat the area dry with a soft towel. When rising your scalp, do not wash the marks off. If the marks do come off, do not attempt to redraw them. Medications While you are having treatments, your physician may prescribe a steroid (Decadron, Cortisone, Prednisone, etc.). This medication reduces the swelling and inflammation caused by the tumor. While you are taking the steroids, you might have an increased appetite, increased thirst, increased need to urinate, fluid retention, leg cramps and mood changes. If you have these or any other side effects, please tell someone on the radiation oncology treatment team. If you are unable to take this medication for any reason, tell your radiation oncologist, nurse, or a member of your treatment team. Steroids should always be taken with food or an antacid like Maalox. This will help decrease stomach upset. During your course of treatment, your physician may direct you to slowly decrease the steroids. Do not decrease this medication on your own. Skin reactions Follow the skin care guidelines found on the Skin Care instruction sheet. If your skin becomes red, dry and scaly or if it blisters and peels, a member of your treatment team can tell you how to care for the irritated skin. Please do not use your own remedies. - Do not shave in the treated area throughout your therapy. After your treatments end, do not start to shave again until all skin reactions have completely disappeared. Treated skin may be sensitive for many years.

If you are uncomfortable without a bra, check with your nurse about the type of bra to wear. - Do not use any deodorants on the treated side without first discussing with your doctor or nurse. If you perspire heavily, check with your physician about using baking soda under your arms or under your breasts. - Do not swim during your treatment period unless you have the approval of your radiation oncologist.
