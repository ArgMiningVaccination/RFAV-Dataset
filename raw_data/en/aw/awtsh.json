Your next COVID-19 vaccine will help protect you from serious illness this winter. If you've had COVID-19 recently, wait 4 months before booking your vaccine appointment. Cavan and Monaghan COVID-19 Vaccination Centres and Pop up clinics are offering primary vaccinations and adapted bivalent booster doses to eligible cohorts. These new adapted bivalent vaccines offer increased protection against COVID-19 and the Omicron variant. You can book your COVID-19 vaccine appointment online at www.hse.ie/book or you can walk-in to the centre. There are different times offered for different age cohorts, therefore please ensure you book/walk-in to the correct clinic for your age.

Getting the Flu vaccine is the best way to protect yourself, your family, colleagues and our health services.
