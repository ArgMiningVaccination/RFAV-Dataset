Natural makeup has come a long way since the days when \"natural makeup\" conjured up images of DIY lip balms and black charcoal mascara. You now get performance that's on par with the biggest Sephora makeup brands and safer, clean ingredients. If it's going on your face, why wouldn't you want nothing but the best skin-beneficial ingredients? Organic makeup combines the latest innovations in natural chemistry with plants and botanicals that nourish skin and enhance beauty. But with the explosion of clean beauty in an unregulated industry, you now have a myriad of makeup brands calling themselves clean and then you have a handful who are actually 100% natural, nontoxic and clean. While I enjoy using both clean makeup and organic makeup, I wanted to round up the handful of natural makeup brands that are dedicated to being truly all natural without all the junk that you commonly find in clean makeup. Read on for the best nontoxic organic makeup brands on the market. The reason ingredient transparency and making this distinction is important is because, while many people have the luxury of not caring about what ingredients they use, there are many people with life threatening illnesses or who are recovering from life threatening illnesses who can't afford that luxury. Some people's lives literally do depend on keeping all toxins out. Here are some examples of popular clean makeup brands that are not 100% natural: - KOSAS - ILIA - TOWER 28 - WELL PEOPLE Check out the Newest Posts: [100% Pure](https://www.pjtra.com/t/SUNITE1JTU1DSEpORk9HQ0hJRkhPRw) An OG natural skincare and makeup brand that is 100% natural and uses berries, plants and seeds for color.
