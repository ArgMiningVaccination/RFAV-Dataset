In theWest, acupuncture has become associated withanalgesia, its appeal being increased by plausiblebiological mechanisms for its action, such as the gate theory and endorphin release or the insertionof needles into myofascial trigger points in amuscle causing a reflex relaxation. 5 This study reports on a general practitioner (IKC) who had completed a training courseorganised by the British Medical AcupunctureSociety in 1999, and had begun to use this form oftherapy to treat his patients, particularly thosewith musculoskeletal pain, but often alsoproblems such as hyperemesis gravidarum,irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) anddysmenorrhoea. The patients were selected foracupuncture based on failed medical therapy andwillingness to participate. Discontinuation ofanalgesia or non-steroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs (NSAIDs) was encouraged during thecourse of acupuncture. The main aims of this review were to determine how successful acupuncture was in thetreatment of musculoskeletal pain in GeneralPractice, and to assess the implications forElisa PY Kam medical house officerIpswich, Suffolk Guy D Eslick clinical epidemiologistUniversity of SydneyPenrith,Australia Ian K Campbell general practitionerKing's Lynn, Norfolk Correspondence: Guy D Eslick eslickg@med.usyd.edu.auSummary Little is known about the use of acupuncture in general practice. We performed a retrospective review ofthe use of acupuncture in relieving musculoskeletal pain, a condition that is commonly encountered ingeneral practice. A sample of 116 patient records was reviewed, from which 92 patients (mean age 52years; 64% female) met the inclusion criterion of musculoskeletal pain. Information obtained includedage, sex, diagnosis, duration of the problem, length of treatment (weeks), number of treatments, durationof each treatment (minutes), number of needles used, level of benefit obtained from the treatment, andrecurrence of pain. There were many different conditions encountered. We found an association between the general practitioner using fewer needles and patients experiencing greater pain relief. This could be a reflection of treating myofascial pain syndromes, whichoften appear to respond well to a single needle in the key trigger point. Overall, we found that sixty-ninepercent of patients had a good or excellent response to acupuncture treatment. We recommendacupuncture as a treatment option for patients who do not respond to the usual therapies (non-steroidalanti-inflammatory drugs) for musculoskeletal conditions.

Methods During the period 1999 to 2000 the records of 116patients who had been treated with acupuncture atthe practice were reviewed. This consisted of allpatients treated using acupuncture during this timeperiod. Patients were excluded from this study ifthey were treated for conditions other thanmusculoskeletal pain, if the details of the benefitof the treatment were not available or patientconsent was not obtained for the data to be used inthe study. Pain was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) on a scale of 0-10; with 10 being theworst pain experienced and 0 (zero) being no pain.The scale was stated verbally to each patient (e.g.,\"On a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 being the worstpain and 0 being no pain, how would you describeyour pain?\"). Patients did not get to see theirprevious assessments. The treatment benefit wasgrouped into three categories: a reduction in painof 70-100% was classified as excellent, areduction of pain of 30-70% was classified asgood and a reduction in pain of 0-30% wasclassified as poor. The benefit was based on thelast recorded entry in the patient notes and patientswere contacted by telephone if the benefit couldnot be obtained from the notes. Secondary analyses were performed comparing patient and treatment variables of age (15-25, 26-35, 36-45, of acupuncture treatmentscompleted), duration of each treatment (minutes),number of needles (number of needles used during each treatment) and recurrence rates. Analysis wascarried out using the statistical software STATA,version 6.0. 6All results were based on frequency tables and chi-square tests were used. All p-valuescalculated are two-tailed and the alpha-level ofstatistical significance was set at 0.05. Results From the original 116 patient records reviewed,92 met the inclusion criteria for this study. Sixty-four per cent (59/92) were female and 36%(33/92) were male. The mean age of the patientswas 52 years (SD= 16.64, range=15-90). Using at-test there was no significant difference in agebetween females and males (p=0.5) (figure 1). The prevalence of and 31% (29/92) hadhip, knee, ankle, foot, elbow or hand pain (figure2). The duration of the pain ranged between oneweek and 25 years, with 50% (46/92) of thepatients being symptomatic for over six months.The mean number of acupuncture treatments wasthree (SD=1.65, range=1-8). The mean durationtime of each treatment was three minutes(SD=0.53, range=2-4). The mean number ofneedles used during each treatment was three(SD=1.08, range=1-6). The reported treatment benefit was 34% (31/92) excellent, 35% (32/92) good, and 31%(28/92) poor (figure 3). Secondary analyses indicated that knee and shoulder pain required a greater number oftreatments compared with other 5615202530Male FemaleFigure 1 Prevalence % of age and gender of those participating in the acupuncture studyBMAS March 21/2/02 1:02 PM Page 36Audits 37ACUPUNCTURE IN MEDICINE 2002;20(1):35-38. www.medical-acupuncture.co.uk/aimintro.htm(p=0.002). Patients who attended for fewer sessions obtained the greatest benefit (p=0.002). Itwas found that the greater the number oftreatments the less likely it was for pain r ecurrence (p=0.001). Females were six times more likely topresent with recurrent pain compared to maleswho had undergone acupuncture treatment(OR=5.76, 95% CI: 1.23-26.92, p=0.01). Therewas less recurrence among those who had thegreatest benefit compared with a higherrecurrence rate among those who reported a poorbenefit to treatment (p=0.007). In addition, wefound that fewer needles used was associated withgreater benefit to the patient (p=0.05). Discussion Our study suggests that the benefits of acupuncturefor musculoskeletal pain are promising. Sixty-nine per cent of people had a good or excellentresponse to the acupuncture treatment i.e. at leasta 30% reduction in pain. It would be interesting tofollow-up these patients and determine whetherthe effect is lasting. The majority of patients treated consisted of two groups - they were either teenagers ormiddle-aged adults. This age range and the male/female ratio of the patients treated withacupuncture reflected the population within thecatchment area of the general practice. Nosignificant relationship was found between thevariables of patient demographics (age and sex)and the benefit of acupuncture treatment. The mean duration of each acupuncture treatment was three minutes and there was nosignificant difference found in benefit and durationof treatment. This suggests that the duration oftreatment can be reduced to the lower range of two minutes. Moreover, the standard consultation time in general practice is ten minutes; hence anacupuncture session would fit within such a timelimit. The average number of treatment visits per patient for acupuncture was three. There areobviously implications for costs to the NHS. Itwas not feasible to estimate the cost-effectivenessof the acupuncture in this study, but this is animportant area requiring consideration of manyfactors, including the cost of drugs, visits to aGeneral Practitioner, altered numbers of secondaryreferrals and cost of adverse events. Experienced acupuncturists have reported (anecdotally) a correlation between the use offewer needles and a positive outcome. It is saidthat the fewer needles used to achieve success, thebetter the technique. The explanation for thecorrelation in this audit may lie in the points usedduring the treatment, chance, or may simply be areflection of the efficacy of needling in myofascialpain syndromes compared with other forms ofmusculoskeletal pain. The prevalence of conditions treated seems to roughly reflect the types of musculoskeletalproblems seen in general practice, with back painbeing the most prevalent. Ernst and White foundthat acupuncture was better than no treatment intheir meta-analysis of acupuncture for back pain, 7 although the Cochrane review, which did not poolthe results, was not as positive. In other conditions,such as neck pain, the results are even lessconclusive. 8In this study, no significant difference was found between benefit and diagnosis,possibly due to the relatively small numbers ineach diagnosis group.

There are limitations to the interpretation of theresults due to the small time frame and numbersinvolved, but what seems clear from the casesanalysed is that both patients with acute pain andthose with chronic pain benefited. Data collection,even from a single institution such as this, will add valuable information to an area lacking inresearch. 8Future research should consist of longitudinal studies as these types of study designsrepresent a substantial improvement over a case-series or cross-sectional design studies. The success of this general practitioner's acupuncture service as perceived by his patientshas lead to an increase in demand for thistreatment. Unfortunately, as the Practice receivesno extra funding for offering acupuncture, thereare limits on the number of appointments that canbe set aside for acupuncture in a normal workingweek. IKC would like to expand the provision ofthis service in his practice and would like, alongwith a majority of general practitioners (79%), tosee acupuncture provided in the National HealthService (NHS). 9A greater understanding is required of possible models of service provisionin order to facilitate the potential integration ofacupuncture into the NHS. This year sees theadvent of Primary Care Trusts, which willgalvanize the need to investigate the optimummethod of service provision nationally. It has been estimated that there have been over 3,000 clinical trials evaluating traditional Chinesemedicine published in China. 10However, these have not benefited from rigorous clinical trialdesign. Worldwide, there has been a dearth ofrandomised control trials in this area. In this era ofevidence-based medicine, it would be unethical topropose expansion of a treatment, which has notbeen put through the same vigorous testing thatconventional therapies have been subjected to. Ithas been reported that only 0.08% of the NHSResearch and Development funds was used forcomplementary medicine research in 1996 11and only 0.05% of medical charity funds was spent oncomplementary medicine in 1999. 12Considering 1 in 5 of the population may be using complementarymedicine in the UK, these sums seem meagre. At present, nearly 4,000 conventional healthcareprofessionals practise complementary medicine in the UK and are members of their own registerhaving completed varied training programs. 13 The BMA calls for more consensus from thegovernment, Department of Health, NHSExecutive, the medical profession, andacupuncture organisations, to provide guidelinesand agree how acupuncture and othercomplementary and alternative medicine servicescan be integrated into the United Kingdomhealthcare system. 8We concur whole-heartedly with the BMA's report; if there is such an upsurgeof interest, perhaps more so after the positivereporting by the media on the launch of the BMAreport, there must be adequate management of theexpansion of provision of acupuncture to ensurethat safety and training of acupuncturists areadequate.
