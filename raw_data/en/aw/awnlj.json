[Faculty of Natural Health Science Online](/programs/faculty-of-natural-health-science.html) Today people care increasingly for leading a healthy way of life. There are many therapies in the field of natural health sciences that have not been properly addressed by the traditional university and that can be studied through Bircham International University distance learning degree programs. Natural health sciences offer a variety of approaches to living healthy. Beyond medications your health depends on you, and no one else. We are what we eat, we are what we breathe, also what we do, and what we think. Health and wellness result from it. It is important to learn these approaches, some ancient, others very novel. All provide solutions to fight sickness, pain and discomfort. Do they work? Of course, although not even medications are infallible. More and more people trust the professionals who practice natural health sciences. The requirements for the therapeutic professional practice in any specialty of natural health depends much on the country. There are independent associations that assume certain regulation of the therapeutic professional practice, but they rarely possess governmental recognition. The majority of the problems of the therapeutic professional practice derive from irresponsible attitudes, the misleading use of the term \"doctor\", or the actual intrusion into the medical and clinical aspects of health. A preventive and complementary approach to natural health sciences is the best guarantee for successful practice. A BIU distance learning degree program constitutes a good way to provide a solid support to your career as a professional therapist.
