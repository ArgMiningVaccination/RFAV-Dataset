Such wondrous items are known as fetishes. The owner of a fetish can call upon the spirit within to perform specific tasks, depending on the nature of the vessel and the spirit. Given the multitude of spirits within the Tellurian and the ingenuity of the Garou, fetishes of almost any type imaginable may be created. Werewolves hold great reverence toward fetishes, treating them as honored allies rather than mere tools. Such is the nature of the pact that binds spirits into fetishes; they are obligated to serve the Garou only as long as they are respected in return. It is possible to bind a spirit against its will, but these fetishes tend to be rebellious, and most Garou consider them cursed. Of course, the servants of the Wyrm bind Banes into horrifying fetishes of their own... The majority of fetishes are crafted from natural materials (wood, hide, bone, clay), although this is more a preference of most spirits than a hard rule \u2014 Glass Walkers, in particular, tend to bind spirits that prefer more modern, technological housing. Few fetishes are nondescript; Garou adorn them with carved river stones, feathers, beads, and other markings to honor and appease the spirit within. To use a fetish, the Garou must first attune herself to it by making a Gnosis roll. The difficulty for this roll is the fetish's Gnosis rating. Attunement establishes a spiritual bond between fetish and user, enabling the Garou to take the fetish anywhere in the Tellurian and providing instinctive understanding of the fetish's powers. Only a single success is required to attune to the fetish; failure indicates that the fetish has rejected the character. Another roll may not be attempted until the werewolf has somehow reached accord with the resident spirit. Attunement also effectively \"dedicates\" a fetish to its wielder, as though the Rite of Talisman Dedication had been performed on it. Since fetishes have their own Gnosis, an attuned fetish doesn't count against the maximum number of objects a werewolf can have dedicated to him. Each time the wielder wishes to use one of the fetish's powers, the player must make a Gnosis roll (difficulty equal to the fetish's Gnosis rating) to \"activate\" the power. Alternatively, she may simply spend a Gnosis point to activate the power automatically. Rage may not be spent during the same turn in which a fetish is activated Level One[ ] Apeskin[ ] Gnosis 6 This somewhat gruesome fetish is nonetheless highly useful for metis and lupus Garou who need to hide their true nature. When activated, the fetish \u2014 which takes the form of a scrap of ape or human skin tattooed with a glyph \u2014 makes the werewolf suffer no special damage from silver in Homid form, and also renders the Garou unable to regenerate in that form \u2014 just as though they were born homid. One activation lasts for a full day. To create an apeskin, a homid ancestor-spirit must be bound into the skin. Harmony Flute[ ] Gnosis 5 Carved from hickory, this small flute has many small songbird feathers decorating it. When activated and played (which requires a Performance roll), the flute emits an enchanting melody, reawakening ancient memories of peace from ages past, when the world was whole. When an aggressive creature hears the song, it must make a successful Rage roll or cease its struggles. Creatures without Rage may not resist the flute's music. Any being listening to the sound may still defend itself if attacked. One activation lasts for as long as the werewolf continues to play. To create a harmony flute, one must bind a bird-spirit or a spirit of peace, calm, or water into the flute. Magpie's Swag[ ] Gnosis 5 The magpie's swag can be pretty much any simple closable bag, satchel, sack, or similar container, which can hold thrice the amount of a regular bag the same size. If dedicated, it counts as a single item, even if filled with other fetishes or even non-dedicated items, and it is represented by a stripe of fur in Crinos, Hispo, and Lupus forms. Unfortunately, it cannot contain complex Weaver objects such as guns or laptops, unless these items are broken and useless, or have been independently dedicated. Variations of this fetish include the corporate brief case of the Glass Walkers, the gym bag of the Bone Gnawers and the medicine bag of the Uktena. Also, a level two variation exists \u2014 the spider's satchel \u2014 which is capable of carrying Weaver objects. To create a magpie's swag, one must bind a magpie or marsupial spirit into the container. Mirrorshades[ ] Gnosis 7 When activated, this pair of mirrored sunglasses produce a mirrored surface on the inside of the glasses, allowing the wearer to step sideways with ease. The Gauntlet is considered 2 lower than it would otherwise be when doing so. To create mirrorshades, one must bind a glass elemental into the shades. Nyx's Bangle[ ] Gnosis 6 A favorite of Ragabash, this fetish resembles a silver bracelet with glyphs honoring Luna carved into it. When activated, it allows the wearer to blend with shadows and move around unseen at night. Only the eyes betray the werewolf, shining like twin full moons in the darkness. Unlike the talen: Nightshade (see p. 229), the wearer of Nyx's bangle doesn't turn into shadow, but merely has her presence masked. She gains four extra dice to Stealth pools at night when the fetish is activated. To create Nyx's bangle, one must bind a spirit of night or darkness into the bangle. Truth Earring[ ] Gnosis 6 This small golden earring acts as a fairly reliable lie detector when activated. Should the wearer be lied to, the earring vibrates softly. All rolls made to try and deceive the werewolf through speech or sound are made at +3 difficulty. The earring doesn't warn against visual deception. To create a truth earring, one must bind a servant of Falcon into the golden earring. Cornerstones[ ] Gnosis 6 Countless unassuming talismans of this type were introduced into North America with the immigration and labor-intesnsive periods of the early twentieth century (many of which were Mafia- and Glass Walker Don-controlled). When build into the foundations of buildings, these cubes of grey stone (some of which bear peculiar engravings) bind a sympathetic spirit into the structure's Umbral manifestation. This stowaway-presence often takes on a cohabitant relationship with the building's original \"tenant\"; in many cases, the building-spirit is subsumed and/or replaced altogether. A handful of powerful Dons and Theurges among the Glass Walkers have rekindled the ancient vows of friendship and loyalty with these symbiont spirits; the networks of information and influences made available to these few are considerable indeed. System: There are no explicit game mechanics, although building-spirits bound using Cornerstones are far more favorably disposed (and helpful) towards those who bind or otherwise invoke them Pinch Bugs[ ] Gnosis 3 Pinch bugs are fetishes that appear to be some kind of larger insect - ladybugs, bumblebees or mantises, for example - crafted from clay and often painted garish colors. A werewolf can stick one of these little bugs to an item he wants to protect from casual snooping, activating the fetish as it is attached. When anyone but the werewolf tries to open or disturb the item in question, the pinch bug comes to life and \"stings\" the offender. This is nonlethal, but it's exceedingly painful, like the worst wasp sting imaginable. If the offender has some compelling reason to remain silent, he must make a Willpower roll, difficulty 8, to avoid screeching or hurling some kind of expletive at the top of his lungs. MIDAS.EXE[ ] Gnosis 4 Often subtler than the cliche ATM-card fetish, and certainly faster than the time-honored \"brute-force\" hacker's approach, this pesky little subroutine takes the passe practices of cypherphreaking, computerized theft, and credit card fraud to the next logical level. It's \"the choice of a new generation\" - as advertised by that new generation, anyway. System: MIDAS.EXE can theoretically hack any financial database, sight-unseen (ATM, bank, cred card network, others as appropriate) with which its host computer can physically connect - it's just a matter of establishing that physical connection. Once online, the program, through a sort of rudimentary learning process, will even assist and second-guess its user; add number of successes on a straight Gnosis roll (difficulty 6) to the next Computer-related dice pool dealing with this system. Note that specialized cases (ATMs, telephone sub-systems, etc) require appropriate (often unique) hardware for physical connection; the laptop-connected magnetic ATM-card probe from Terminator 2: Judgment Day would be a good example. As with any new hacker's toy, careless and/or constant use may attract the attention of certain watchers - or even those who watch the watchers... Fertility Charms[ ] Gnosis 2 Many different sorts of fertility charms exist; the labrys itself is considered to be a fertility symbol by many. Others include a stylized woman's body, such as the Venus of Willendorf; catseyes or simply stone or wooden cat pendants; eggs; frogs; the lotus; and many others. Furies bind spirits of particularly fertile animals (rabbits, cats, frogs) into these charms and in so doing create a spot of magic that increases a woman's chance of conceiving healthy young. Fertility charms work just as well on a female Garou or wolf as they do on a human, though they do not improve the mother's chance of conceiving a Garou child. And of course, none of them work on a metis. Some more powerful version of these charms also improve the mother's health through the pregnancy, increasing her chances of surviving it and living to raise her child. Garou rarely need such assistance, and modern medicine does a moderately good-job of caring for humans, so these sorts of charms are slowly disappearing. Fertility charms have no game effect; the results of sexual encounters are better left in the hands of the Storyteller than a roll of the dice. Lost Keyring[ ] Gnosis 5 The Garou with this device owns hundred of keys attached to a six-inch steel ring. By activating the fetish, a Garou can evaluate the complexity of locks on a door, window, or other barrier directly in front of him. For mechanic-minded players, the Storyteller can rate this complexity on a scale of 1 to 5. Overcoming the locks then requires a Perception + Repair roll against a difficulty of (5+ the lock's complexity). Even one success shows that the Garou has found the right key to jimmy the lock. Unless the key is used immediately, however, the user's fumbling hand loses it within a few rounds. This fetish works remarkably like the Gift: Open Seal, but in the same fashion, it won't protect against security systems, motion sensors, or electronic alarms on the lock. Ivan's Molotov[ ] Gnosis 5 The first fetish of this kind was crafted by Ivan Ivanovich, an infamous Theurge of the Sept of the People's Will in Moscow. It is a flask containing a flammable liquid ideal for thrown projectiles. When activated, it can fill up a small flask with a clear, odorless fluid. Ivan's Molotov can fill three other flasks before it must be \"refilled\"(see below). Sticking a cloth in the neck of the bottle prepares it for battle. When the bottle is thrown (Dexterity + Athletics), the object is smashes into receives five dice of aggravated damage. A burst of flame and broken glass then burn and shred anything within three yards of this target, inflicting three dice of aggravated damage. Bottles filled with Ivan's Molotov must be hurled one at a time, however. If two of these bottles land within five yards of each other, they detonate with a loud bang, produce a cloud of smoke, and fizzle out without inflicted any damage at all. If the flask filled with Ivan's Molotov runs dry, the owner can meditate over it, usually contemplating the last riot, protest or uban upheaval he witnessed. The owner rolls Wits + Enigmas (difficulty 6) and spends one Gnosis to refill the fetish. The Whole Gym Bag[ ] Gnosis 5 This battered satchel holds a mass of objects up to twice the actual size of the bag -- a perfect fetish for any collection of Junk, Stuff, and Loot. Furthermore, the bag itself, including all its contents, count as one item when it is \"dedicated\" to the Garou. The Gym Bag appears as a stripe of fur (representing the shoulder strap) when the Garou changes to Crinos form. It disappears completely when the character is in Hispo or Lupus form. There are limits, however, on what objects can stay inside when the Garou shifts. Because of the Wyld energy within it, it cannot contain complex examples of the Weaver's handiwork: namely, guns and other weapons or working technological items. Gym Bags can't contain other smaller Gym Bags (sorry!), nor can they be expanded with the Rite of the Shopping Cart. In other words, if you need to carry a shotgun or a laptop (urrah!), you should dedicate it separately. By contrast, broken or nonfunctional bits of technology (that is, Junk) can easily be carried. If these conditions are not met, the bag drops to the ground and spills its contents when the Garou shifts out of Homid or Glabro form. Dice of Challenge[ ] Gnosis 5 This is a pair of dice carved from amber or bone and inlaid with mother-of-pearl, malachite, etc. Philodox use these dice to settle disputes when the Garou at odds will not agree to their judgement. An Ancestor who judged fairly must animate this fetish. The judge brings out the dice and allows both disputants to handle them, then prays to Gaia to resolve the issue, spending one Gnosis for each Garou involved in the quarrel. He then allows the disputants to roll the dice. The Garou whose cause is \"right\" (as Unicorn would define it), if either disputant counts will always win; if both disputants have equally just causes, the dice always comes up tied. Air Hightops[ ] Gnosis 2 It's gotta be the shoes! Invented after a rooftop chase nearly went nasty, these basketball shoes allow the Glass Walker to nearly float when jumping. The Glass Walker adds two dice to any Athletics roll involving jumping. In addition, he takes no damage from falls provided he can make a Dexterity + Athletics roll (difficulty equal to the number of stories fallen). They are bound with a Wind Spirit, and can only be used in Homid or Glabro. SpiComs[ ] Gnosis 2 A favorite of Dies Ultimae, SpiComs are specialized communication systems that employ the Umbra as a medium. The system consists of a mouthpiece, earpiece and a small metal box attached to the belt and wired to the headpiece. Each SpiCom also has a pattern spider bound into it. When someone talks into the mouthpiece, the pattern spider records it and senses whom the message is for, flying instantly to their SpiCom and delivering the message. This setup means that a message can only be sent from one person to another. In order to facilitate group co-ordination many packs prefer to configure their SpiCons to contact a central server, which then sends a pattern spider to every SpiCom. Texas Drinking Glass[ ] Gnosis 1 Particularly favored by Glass Walkers in Texas and Georgia, this cup infers the Gift: Resist Toxin on whoever drinks from it. However, the werewolf becomes intoxicated as normal, suffering standard penalties; he is simply able to handle more alcohol before passing out appropriately (and is incapable of passing out inappropriately). Though the glass always seems half-full, the Glass Walkers that tend to have these fetishes seem anything but optimistic. High Pitch Transmitter[ ] Gnosis 2 The ear of a wolf can hear sounds much, much higher than that of a human being. This Cyberfetish raises the Garou's voice tone beyond the human range of hearing but within the wolf range, allowing the Glass Walker to speak while remaining inaudible to humans. Whilst this fetish may be used in any form, only Garou in Crinos, Hispo or Lupus will hear the signal. Hardware Virus[ ] Gnosis 3 As any technical support will tell you, a normal computer virus can't infect hardware, only software. This is not a normal virus. Bound with a pattern spider, this Software can and does attach itself to hardware that is frequently used on many computers (such as digital cameras), and destroys hardware that is mostly used on one computer (such as monitors), in spectacular fashion. As a general rule, they explode. Damage done by exploding printers is best left to the Storyteller to decide. Wanderer's Friend[ ] Gnosis 4 The Silent Striders have an image to maintain -- that of the unflappable traveler, never lost, and never at a loss for which way to go. With expectations so high, the first step of that first journey can be a doozy. This fetish is often gifted to a young Strider by a mentor after she undergoes her Rite of Passage, as a way of smoothing the road. At first glance, the fetish appears to be a normal compass. A closer look reveals glyphs on the compass face, and a second needle floating from the center point. When the owner is holding the compass as she gets directions to her destination (and the compass has been successfully activated), the spirit of magnetism housed within hears and remembers the directions. As the Strider travels, the two needles remain together until the owner reaches a landmark or crossroads given in the directions; at that point, the second needle swings to show the next direction. The compass understands every language spoken by the Garou who created the fetish (and thus it might understand a language that its owner does not), and it is even capable of interpreting pantomimed directions with reasonable accuracy. The compass is entirely dependent on the directions received, however, and the directions might always be plain wrong. Elders grumble that some youths enamored with technology have duplicated this fetish's functionality with a GPS receiver and an electricity elemental. The warm patina of a compass handed down for generations from mentor to student cannot be duplicated, of course. Since these fetishes are usually of use only to the newest members of the tribe, an elder seen in possession of one that isn't immediately handed to a cub will be ribbed endlessly and given unbecoming nicknames. Most Striders make it a point to hand their wanderer's compasses off by Rank Two, or Three at the latest. This also helps ensure in small measure that the tribe's active wanderers take some interest in helping new arrivals. Lie Finder[ ] Gnosis 6 This fetish is typically made from the beard of an adult male turkey. The owner uses it by pointing it to the subject (who is within speaking distance) and succeeding in a Gnosis roll. The effect lasts until the user stops pointing the fetish at a given person. If successful and the target deliberately lies, one of the bristles snaps off and falls to the ground. When the last bristle breaks off (and there may be several dozen), the spirit is freed. A spirit of truth or honesty is bound into the fetish. Jar of Secrets[ ] Gnosis 5 An early version of a tape recorder, this small earthen jar stores spoken messages. By spending a Gnosis point, the user may speak into the jar for up to a minute, after which he may seal the words in with the lid. Up to five messages may be so saved. If the pot is opened without being activated, the mssages are released in order from newest to oldest, and are heard at the volume with which the pot received them. Once repeated, the message is lost. If the activation roll botches, the jar shatters. Spirits of wind or echoes are bound into this fetish. Wild Rice[ ] Gnosis 5 This fetish created with wild rise can mystically heighten fertility, increasing a female Garou's chances to conceive and continue the Wendigo bloodline. Stalks of the rice can be gathered into a small bundle, braided together, and bound with a thread or leather thong soaked in her menstrual blood; or the ripened kernels of rice can be shaken free of the stalks and gathered into a small pouch, tied around the werewolf's neck with the same blood-soaked thread. Then the werewolf who wishes to conceive must bind a spirit of one of her female ancestors, an earth spirit, or another fertility spirit into the fetish. While it is activated, the Garou should not remove it from her person, especially not during sexual congress. The exact game effects are left to the Storyteller's discretion as to what is appropriate for her chronicle. Wendigo Dagger[ ] Gnosis 6 Most Wendigo blade fetishes are carved from walrus tusks or other bone, impervious to changes in temperature, and frequently have a spirit bound within them by performing the Rite of the Fetish upon its first blooding. Wendigo blades are practical, razor-sharp, and not usually elaborate, although their hafts are often wrapped with a decorative thong or woven quill-pattern. The taste of fresh blood on a Wendigo dagger generally serves to awaken the bound spirit inside. Bells of Rain[ ] Gnosis 6 This fetish consists of a string of small metal bells carried upon the person of the Garou. These bells remain completely silent until the fetish is activated; then the bells appear to ring, but a sound like gentle rain on a spring morning sounds in the area. The fetish then creates a modest rainfall in the area (outdoors only). It can bring tain three times before it must be recharged by exposing it to ftatural rain. Slightly rarer versions of these bells chime gently before a natural rainfall, To create this fetish, a Garou must bind a Rain-spirit, Water-spirit or Air-spirit into the bells. Fang of the Wyrm[ ] Gnosis 3 Septs often give these simple fetishes to new Garou after their Rites of Passage. A Fang resembles just that: a pearly white fang on a leather thong. When the fang is activated, it reacts to the presence of the Wyrm by turning a mottled, bilious green. The more corrupted the surroundings, the darker the fang becomes. The fang clears after being in a Gaian caern for an hour. Any spirit servant of Gaia can empower this fetish. Moonwatch[ ] Gnosis 4 This wristwatch automatically tells a Garou what the current moon phase is and whether it is waxing or waning. When activated, the watch indicates to the user what auspice the person before him is. To create a Moonwatch, a Garou must bind a Lune or Gaffling of Luna into a sanctified timepiece. Level Two[ ] Cup of the Alicorn[ ] Gnosis 6 The oldest of these carved and covered cups, handed down in old European septs, are said to be made of unicorn horn, though the truth of this is unknown. Any harmful substance is neutralized when poured into this cup. With a Gnosis roll against the Intelligence + Science of the poisoner, the holder of the cup can even recognize the type of poison by the changes in the cup's shimmer or color. To create a cup of the alicorn, one must bind a spirit of healing, or a snake- or bear-spirit into the cup. Chameleon Skin[ ] Gnosis 7 Garou needing to keep a low profile and stay out of sight commonly use this fetish. Generally a belt or headband, it allows the Garou's fur to blend in with her surroundings. Chameleon's skin is most efficient in the wild and other densely overgrown areas, but some Glass Walkers have fetishes that easily harmonize with their urban surroundings of glass, steel and concrete. When activated, this fetish acts as the Wendigo Gift: Camouflage, save that the power may function in whatever environment the fetish is attuned to. A chameleon-spirit, naturally, must be bound into this fetish in order to create it. Chances are that the chameleon-spirit will be easier to sway if the skins are those of a lizard other than chameleons or, indeed, from another type of animal altogether. Dagger of Retribution[ ] Gnosis 5 This particular fetish, an ugly iron dagger, was devised as a means of tracking down stolen possessions and the thieves responsible. The werewolf concentrates on the lost item while holding the dagger; the weapon gently tugs in the direction of the item until the Garou reclaims it. If the fetish's owner knows the face or name of the thief, he may use the dagger to locate the thief as well. The fetish is treated as a knife in combat (Strength damage, difficulty 4); the damage may be lethal or aggravated at the Garou's discretion. To create a dagger of retribution, a werewolf must bind a vengeance-spirit into the dagger Dream Stealer[ ] Gnosis 5 A Dream Stealer, or Chimera Gem, is a multi-colored gemstone that can extract and project another's dream. The gem is placed near the target when asleep, and when activated it will allow the user to view the target's dreams, replayed in the depths of the stone. To create a Chimera Gem, one must bind a spirit of dream or one of Cuckoo's brood into the stone. Spirit Tracer[ ] Gnosis 5 This fetish is a human hair suspended in an iron ingot. When the wielder activates the fetish and concentrates upon a specific spirit, the ingot pulls in that direction. This fetish only works for tracking spirits. To create a spirit tracer, one must bind a predator spirit or a spirit that has the Charm: Tracking into the ingot. Breakneck Overthruster[ ] Gnosis 4 An intricate fist-sized mass of cable and chrome, mated with turbine collars, fuel intake valves, and/or other electromechanical modules suitable to its target platform(s), the Overthruster (brainchild of the mysterious hengeyokai sentai Gaiamon) interfaces easily with any air-, land-, or sea-based propulsion system. Although perpetual motion appears to be beyond the capabilities of even the greater Celestines, this device does come pretty close. This awesome technofetish augments the efficiency and output of its parent drive by at least a factor of three, streching the limits of believability -- automobiles coupled with the Overthruster experience dramatically lessened acceleration curves and consumption approaching hundreds of miles to the gallon, while impellers and jet turbines seem to shrug off the limitations of surface friction, soaring to still greater performances (indeed, this device might enjoy greater airborne application, were it not for the inescapable setback posed by pilot blakout at or around March 3...) Dumbed-down version of the Overthruster (including but not limited to the afterburner systems employed by F-18 jet fighters) have apparently cropped up in unaided human endeavors; whether this is a case of true serendipity or some gently guiding hand, no one is certain. System: Miraculous as this dvice might seem, it quickly outpaces even the most sophisticated mundane components; assume a maximum lifetime of two or three hours' continuous use (somewhat longer if uses are short-lived and/or widely spaced) before system-wide failure (seizure, overheating, part fatigue, etc.) effectively disables the host vehicle Vetruvian Harness[ ] Gnosis 3 These devices adapted from a primitive (dophin-mounted) Connecticut shipyard's design, provide Garou in Hispo and Lupus forms (and even wolves, if they can be suitably trained) with the semblance and facilities of an additional set of limbs. These expansions, commonly dedicated to their owners, can be configured with a variety of attachments - claws, grasping digits, various tools, or even weapons. System: Most of these devices allow manipulation and control of two extra \"extremities\"; they don't allow extra actions without the use of Rage or dice pool splitting, but are in most ways admirable substitutes for flesh-and-blood limbs. Although considerably more flexible than the real thing, these appendages are nowhere near as facile or dextrous; the wearer's Dexterity is effectively a point lower for the purposes of using the harness (although the Hispo or Lupus Dexterity usually makes up for this). Akagi Security Screen[ ] Gnosis 6; alternately, Device 2 Developed by a Taiwanese hacker using the handle \"Bassho\" (after the eleventh-century Japanese poet), this ingenious algorithm has become the hottest thing on the 'Web since Phil Zimmerman's PGP cryptokey. Several key players within the United Nations have already adopted a heavily modified variant for internal security in the event of Threat Condition Charlie (electronic terrorism). Akagi (Japanese, \"red castle\") reacts to invasive electronic presences, including but not limited to hackers, tapeworms, and viruses. Once triggered, it floods the network with a number of false copies of its host computer onto the network (initially 255, spawning false subnets and exploding into 255 if/when the invader gets close to burning through them all - treat as practically infinite); these false copies are dynamically cycled through virtual memory in smaller sub-groups so as not to overburden the original system. Whereas the screen is a primarily passive defense, it serves to frighten attackers away or to keep them busy long enough for traces and/or countermeasures to be deployed. (To further complicate affairs, a Brittish variant of the Akagi digifortress (christened \"Minas Tirith\" by \"Saruman,\" its 14-year-old whiz-kid creator) has already come into being which nests its false computer-copies one within the next, up to seven deep). System: The subtle nature of this security program makes it difficult to penetrate, although, given an original copy of the Akagi code with which to experiment, Storytellers might allow hackers an Intelligence + Computer roll (difficulty 10) to discover a back door or some identifier separating the host computer from its false copies. Note that the fetish and mundane-tech versions of this program differ considerably in one important respect; only the Akagi-fetish's false computer-copies show up in the Umbra. DoubleFeint[ ] Gnosis 6; alternately, Device 3 This library of \"feint-within-a-feint\" macros and code templates is believed to have originated somewhere in or around the hacker's Mecca of Ouluboxi, Finland. Whether or not recent Scandinavian investigations on the part of Pentex ICS (through its associated corporate fronts) have anything to do with this bit of urban legend is left as an exercise for the reader. This devious package essentially creates a \"ship in a bottle\" -- a simulated computer environment, indistinguishable from reality to all but the most dedicated scrutiny, beneath which its users play an intricate game of information warfare. Elite uberhackers use DoubleFeint-smithed fool-proof logins, user IDs, seemingly-inocent background processes, and/or falsified crash/system emergency symptoms as a cover for their riskier exploits; security specialists and system administrators lay subtle snares (gaping holes in firewalls, illusory back-door passwords, and the like) for those who would trespass onto their electronic territory. System: Currently nouveau chic among the computer elite, DoubleFeint gives both sides of the digital war a \"second chance\" - users (hackers, system monitors, etc.) must penetrate this false identity/environment before revealing (or letting slip) any real information. In game terms, this becomes an additional margin for error on Computer-related rolls; the first successful monitoring attempt (or failed infiltration) unearths only the falsified data. Repeated efforts (a second success or failure) are needed to punch through this false front; before this is breached, however, most intelligent users will take action (springing their trap(s) or just plain disconnecting). Storytellers should feel free to make pertinent rolls in secret, treating botches as catastrophic missteps (e.g., the hacker's true identity has been discovered without her knowledge, or the system administrator's snare has been quietly spotted and left untouched). Theoretically, there is no limit to the number of secondary (and tertiary, and so on and so forth) systems that can be nested one within the next; in practice, however, attempts to layer more than one false front result in severe system overload, often leading to irrecoverable crashes. Cyberjocks among the Garou have capitalized upon this already ingenious design, taking it to a new level; such spirit-infused software given its user(s) false Umbra identity or even invisibility as well as electronic powers of evasion. Vulcan AEI 2.0[ ] Gnosis 5 This advanced developer's environment, termed a second-generation AEI (Affordance Engineering Interface) by its reclusive creator, serves as an extension of its hardware-oriented predecessor (Vulcan's Interface) into the programmer's world. Once installed, this high-level command language gives users direct and intuitive control over any firmware/software-driven system (elementary keyboard input (\"format hard drive\"), vocal/microphone direction (\"Mother, I want to turn off the self-destruct sequence\"), virtual touchscreen navigation, etc.) over any system employing firmware/software. Examples include but are not limited to: mainframes with privileged superuser access, Internet browsers and their associated computers, even modern automobiles' embedded microprocessor systems. Owing to its complexity and stubborn refusal to succesfully up/download, the Vulcan AEI must be installed in person, and will not operate over networks - although rumors run rampant through the Digital Web of an imminent 3.0 upgrade in the works Thunder Drum[ ] Gnosis 6 This fetish doesn't actually have to be a drum; any easily portable musical instrument will do, as long as it can play low, threatening tones (no one has ever crafted a Thunder Banjo, for instance). The Garou beats the drum while marching into battle, unnerving his foes with its quiet, yet pervasive rhythm. The activation successes are subtracted from the initiative scores of any opponent who hears it, for the first turn of combat only. The Garou must beat the drum for at least two turns before rolling to activate the fetish. To create a Thunder Drum, the Garou must bind a war-spirit into the instrument. Power Goggles[ ] Gnosis 3 Now you can have Power Goggles, just like your hero Buck Racer! These goggles are a Bane fetish which allow the fomor to see Garou as they traverse the Gauntlet from the Penumbra to the physical world (roll Perception + Occult, difficulty 7, to be alerted in time). This may give the fomor that crucial extra instant necessary to save his life. Quiver of Silvered Arrows[ ] Gnosis 3 Most of these tools were originally forged during the longago days of open conflict with other tribes; the Shadow Lords and Get of Fenris were particularly anathema to the Furies back then and were on the receiving end of more of these arrows than other tribes were. There are two enchantments on these arrows: first, they are sharper than typical arrowheads, and second, they do not break under ordinary use. That is to say, a Fury can shoot a silvered arrow at a Wyrm-thing, miss, and have the arrow strike a stone wall or the side of a tank, and it will not break. However, if she were to attempt to use the arrow as a melee weapon, climbing piton, or toothpick, she would risk breaking it.A quiver holds a dozen arrows, but counts as just one fetish for the purposes of bindng. The arrows themselves do an additional die of damage (thus, 5 for shortbows and 6 for longbows), and that damage is silver, unsoakable by Garou without special Gifts or armor. These fetishes typically contain Lunes. Rover's Whistle[ ] Gnosis 5 Humans can't hear this fetish, but Garou can. When activated with a Gnosis roll and a good solid blow, the whistle alerts all Garou within a city block, helping them find the user (The effects are similar to the Galliard Gift: Call of the Wyld, but none of that annoying howling is required.) If the user has the Kinfolk Background, he can also summon nearby Kinfolk by blowing the whistle with Charisma + Leadership (difficulty 5); each success can alert one of that Garou's Kinfolk if they're in the area. Keep in mind that this fetish alerts werewolves and Kinfolk that hear it; it doesn't force them to appear at the user's beck and call. A Garou does not have to answer this summons. Bone Gnawers respect this fetish, but werewolves of other tribes get irritated when a Bone Gnawer tries to summon them with a glorified \"dog whistle\". Alternatively, with a Charisma + Animal Ken roll (difficulty 6), the fetish alerts all the street dogs in the neighborhood; actually summoning or manipulating them requires further Charisma + Animal Ken rolls. A few Masters of the Rite in urban caerns have quested specifically for this fetish, so that they can summon septs without alerting their human neighbors. Such a worthy hero proudly wears this treasure on a chain around his neck Tattoo of True Shape[ ] Gnosis 6 This fetish is usually a tattoo or scar, although it can also be worn as a piercing. An octopus-spirit or other shapeshifting spirit is bound into the fetish. Developed by the Ragabash Soldier-of-Paradise, it contours the Garou's shapeshifting to make him comfortable and functional in any space. Thus the huge Crinos form might become thicker-bodied and smaller in a confined corridor, more able to move or fight. The Hispo would fit into a tiny elevator by being taller and more erect, though its four-footed stance and fighting claws would not change. A Garou can shift from Homid to Lupus while in a cramped tunnel without the Crinos shape being a problem. The tattoo must be activated during shapeshifting; it's impossible to spend a Rage point to shift forms and activate the tattoo in the same turn. The five forms are still recognizable no matter what the fetish does, and it does not enable Garou to take new forms. This fetish is especially helpful to Garou who invade Black Spiral labyrinths and other alien Wyrm-spaces. Whether the Black Spirals themselves have learned of it is not known. Belt of the Unicorn[ ] Gnosis 6 This is a belt made from white leather in which a Gaffling of Unicorn dwells. When it is worn, it protects the wearer from ingested poison, including Wyrm-venoms, and from all natural sickness; radioactive and supernatural toxins and corrosives that are absorved through the skin or injected are still a danger. No roll is necessary. Goibhnius' Hammer[ ] Gnosis 6 Though not a combat fetish, it is highly prized by Fianna smiths; some of the finest weapons, including several klaives, were forged with these hammers. For every two successes on a Gnosis roll, the smith gains +1 die to the metalworking (Craft) roll. In addition, items crafted with the hammer reduce the difficulty for a Rite of the Fetish by one; such items are more pleasing to spirits. An earth or fire spirit is bound into this fetish. Pipes of the Otherworld[ ] Gnosis 5 This fetish typically appears as a very fine set of black bagpipes (usually of the Highland variety) with an unusually mournful song that pulls at the spirit -- literally. When successfully activated, every two successes to a Charisma + Performance (7) roll subtracts one from the difficulty of Mystic Rituals; the difficulty rating for Rituals of Death (such as a Rite for the Departed) is decreased by one for every success. Security Sniffer[ ] Gnosis 4 A basic search engine program outfitted with the spirit of any urban bird, this program can be run on any security camera system that involves a computer at some point. The program can then be configured to look for anyone fitting a specific description. The value of this program obviously depends on how large the system is, on a government system overseeing many public areas it can be profoundly efficient. Cub's Vigor[ ] Gnosis 6 Usually bound into a small piece of bone or skin, the Cub's Vigor fetish allows the user to call upon the seemingly boundless energy of a young pup. Upon activation, the character is immediately refreshed and can function for eight hours ormally without sleep or food. If the activation roll garners three or more successes, the player may also choose to regain a point of temporary Willpower or heal one bashing or lethal health level. This fetish can be used only once per day. Judge's Dagger[ ] Gnosis 4 These jet-black blades are used exclusively by the Judges of Doom. They are feared weapons, and with good reason - many a target has fallen to a single strike from such a blade. Before they can be useful, however, they must first be attuned to a target. Two things are required before this may happen. First, the target must be guilty of violating the Litany in some fashion. The specifics are not important, but the dagger works much more effectively if the transgression is a serious one. Equally important is the need for an item of significance to the target or (preferably) his blood. If the target is guilty and the item is available, the dagger may be properly attuned. To attune the blade, the wielder must make a Charisma + Rituals check (difficulty 7) and invest a number of Gnosis points in the dagger equal to the target's Rank. (Those without Rank are exempt from the law of Litany, of course, although Black Spiral Dancers may still be targeted - they are, after all, criminals against Gaia.) This Gnosis remains in the dagger until the victim is slain, and may not be recovered until that time. Once the dagger is attuned, however, the wielder may learn the direction of the target relative to herself simply by placing the dagger in a pool of water. Any pool will do - some Judges have even used rainpuddles. If there's room for the dagger to move, it will unerringly point out the target's location (assuming the victim isn't using Gifts or other supernatural powers to mask his true location). Once the Judge has found the target, the second benefit of attunement becomes apparent. Any successful strike by the dagger inflicts a number of levels of aggravated damage equal to the number of Gnosis points stored within it, in addition to normal dagger damage. Only the intended target may be damaged in this fashion -- the target's allies are not affected. Once the target has been eliminated, the wielder's Gnosis returns to her and the dagger may be attuned to a new target. To create a Judge's Dagger, a spirit of vengeance or retribution must be bound within the weapon. Stone-Headed Mace[ ] Gnosis 5 These ancient weapons were easy for human hands to craft - a hole was laboriously drilled through a large rock, and a strong wooden haft was inserted. These simple materials were also appealing to spirits allied with the Garou, particularly spirits of nature or the element of earth. Once the weapon was embellished with gold wire and carved with Garou and Egyptian glyphs, a spirit was usually willing to inhabit the fetish and lend it power. When wielded by a Homid-form Garou, a stone-headed mace does Strength + 1 bashing damage. When the wielder changes to Glabro, the mace increases proportionally, and inflicts Strength + 2 bashing damage. When the wielder assumes Crinos form, the mace grows again (resembling a small boulder on a tree trunk), at this size inflicting Strength +3 bashing damage. Since these weapons are relatively simple to make they are still common. Even nature spirits and eath elementals are more jaded in modern times, however, and it may take particularly skillful or precious ornamentation to convice a spirit that the mace is a suitable home. Snake Bow[ ] Gnosis 5 This finely crafted bow has the skin of a rattlensake running along the back (the convex side). Any arrow loosed from the activated bow does, if any of its initial damage is unsoaked, an additional level of aggravated damage on the following turn; the wound burns as if poisoned. A rattlesnake spirit empowers this fetish. Uktena Scale[ ] Gnosis 6 Those whom Uktena favors may find a reddish or whitish triangular scale (thumbnail-to palm-sized) with a razor-sharp edge -- a cast off from the side of an uktena. By giving it the merest taste of his own blood (a Damageless nick) and succeeding on a Gnosis roll, the owner may make any Enigmas rolls at -2 difficulty for the remainder of the scene. In addition, feeding the scale allows the bearer to shift (even partially shift) at -1 difficulty for one turn per success on the activation roll. When activated, it shimmers and sparkles like fire. Because finding one is never considered happenstance (and no Uktena in her right mind would challenge for the scale), the Uktena is marked as watched by a totem spirit, receiving a temporary point of Honor. those who betray that favor suffer in tragic but intriguing ways. Once the owner dies, the scale loses the above abilities. However, it may be used for a different purpose by anyone who knows the proper ritual. The new owner must take splinters from a lightning-struck tree, light it from a natural source (including flint or friction but not matches or a lighter) and burn the scale. Wrapping remaining coal (which is gray or black and always has a reddish glow in the center) in a piece of deerskin grants the bearer +1 per two successes on a Gnosis roll on any hunting or tracking roll. The effects last for a scene. However the fetish must be hung outside n the woods when not in use, for its energies poison those unlucky enough to be indoors in its presence (one level of Aggravated damage per hour for being in the same room, per two hours in an adjacent room. Flint Arrow Shirt[ ] Gnosis 7 This armor shirt is made from a hundred or more stone arrow and spear heads, held together by sinew and plaited hair. When active it allows the wearer an additional soak die per success for one scene (including silver). In addition, activation causes a layer of clear ice to form around the flint, offering similar protection from the effects of fire and intense heat. A flint spirit and an ice spirit are both required to empower this fetish War Whistle[ ] Gnosis 5 Crafted from the leg-bone of an eagle or other hunting bird, and usually decorated with porcupine quills or bright dangling feathers, a war-whistle contains a bound war-spirit of ferocious bloodthirstiness. Awarded by the Elders to a chosen battle-leader or war chief before the fighting begins, this fetish only awakens when its bearer blows it with icy Rage in his heart. The shrill, piercing shriek of the whistle carries over the battleground, summoning all the leader's allies to the fight; it also allows the user to immediately roll Charisma + Intimidation to intimidate all foes on the battlefield. The Wendigo using a War Whistle may add 2 dice to his Intimidation dice pool for this purpose. Friendship Ring[ ] Gnosis 6 These fetishes generally ally themselves with Children of Gaia; any member of another tribe is at +2 difficulty when attempting to attune herself to this fetish. The ring can be made of any material but usually has to have a symbol for peace from some culture inscribed on it. When activated, this fetish forms a temporary bond of friendship with a target. The Garou need not already be friends with the target, but they cannot be enemies. The user gains +1 to all Social rolls affecting the target for one scene. To create a Friendship Ring, one of the following spirit types must be bound into the,ring: Peace, Calm, Dog or Unicorn. Kinship Doll[ ] Gnosis 5 This fetish is a small doll that resembles a potbellied human. When a Garou activates and concentrates on a particular Kinfolk relative, the doll speaks to the Garou and reveals the Kin's location and general condition. The more activation successes the player scores, the more detailed is the information he receives. To create a Kinship Doll, one of the following spirit types must be bound into the doll: Ancestor, Love or Pelican. Lagomorph's Boon[ ] Gnosis 7 This fetish can actually take many shapes but is often literally a rabbit's foot. The bearer of this object receives uncommonly good luck. For each activation success, the player can negate one botch per story. This power can. be used only once per story. At the Storyteller's discretion, the Boon can aid the player in other, secret ways. To create this fetish, one of the following spirit types must be bound into the object: Rabbit, Fortune or Cat. Power Spike[ ] Gnosis 7 A Glass Walker favorite, this fetish takes the form of a small chrome spike. When laid next to a machine and activated, the spike sends out a surge of destructive energy that fries circuits, trips breakers and bums fuses. The'tnore complex the machine, the more likely that some delicate part of it is damaged; the number of successes determines the extent of the destruction. To create a Power Spike, one of the following spirit types must be bound into the spike: Electricity, Wyld, Cockroach or Storm. Level Three[ ] Baneskin[ ] Gnosis 7 This tiny piece of a Bane is wrapped carefully in cloth and worn as an amulet. When activated, it causes all malevolent spirits to react to the wearer as if she were a kindred soul \u2014 a wolf in Bane's clothing, as it were. If the wearer takes any action against her \"fellow\" Banes, the guise is broken immediately. These fetishes cannot fool Incarnae or mightier spirits. To create a Baneskin, one must bind a parrot- or mockingbird-spirit into the skin. Beast Mask[ ] Gnosis 8 This fetish takes the form of a carved mask depicting an animal. When donned and activated, the werewolf assumes the form of the animal the mask represents. The character gains all the characteristics of the animal (flight, gills, heightened senses, etc.) but cannot use her regenerative powers nor change into other forms until she removes the mask. To create a beast mask, one must bind an appropriate animal spirit into the mask. D'siah[ ] Gnosis 6 The d'siah, a knife with a flint blade curved like a crescent moon, is the signature weapon of the Silent Striders. Its sharpened outer edge is used for slashing attacks, while the trailing point can be used to thrust and tear on the return stroke. Because this knife takes skill and training to use properly, the difficulty to attack with it is 7. It inflicts Strength damage. The war spirit bound into the blade, usually one of Cobra's brood, is somewhat more discerning than spirits usually bound to klaives \u2014 a d'siah does aggravated damage only to Wyrm-tainted creatures (use the same guidelines as the Gift: Sense Wyrm) and any type of spirit. In addition, after a successful strike, the Strider can activate the d'siah to drain a point of Gnosis from her opponent (or a point of Essence from spirits). Because this requires a Gnosis roll, the werewolf cannot use this ability of the knife on the same turn she spends Rage for extra actions. The greatest strength of the d'siah is directed against the Striders' greatest foes: Egypt's vampires and their snake-like minions. The cobra-spirit in the blade lashes out violently against its tainted reflections, inflicting Strength +3 aggravated damage. Fang Dagger[ ] Gnosis 6 These daggers are always carved from the tooth or tusk of a great beast. After striking an opponent, the werewolf can activate the weapon, causing it to \"bite\" deeper into the wound. This doubles the number of successes on the damage roll, before soak. The damage is aggravated. To create a fang dagger, one must bind a snake-spirit or a spirit of war, pain, or death into the blade. Partridge Wing[ ] Gnosis 7 This fetish is made from the wing of a partridge bird, its feathers all completely unbroken and white as snow. The joint of the wing has a golden ring fastened through it, and hangs from a long golden chain. To activate the fetish, a werewolf must concentrate upon a memory that she wishes to remove from her mind, and then swing the partridge wing around herself counter-clockwise three times, letting the tips of the feathers brush in a circle around her on the ground. Memories of another human or Garou can also be swept away in a similar fashion, by dragging the feathers by the chain in a circle around them. This fetish is rarely used on Garou and should never be used without permission, but has come in very handy for restoring Delirious humans to their calmer states. To create a partridge wing, one must bind a spirit of water or forgetfulness into the wing. Phoebe's Veil[ ] Gnosis 7 This fetish is a small, golden pendant in the shape of a half moon. These fetishes are usually worn around the neck, held by a strong leather thong. At night, when the pendant is activated, the wearer vanishes completely for one minute per success. Neither mundane creatures nor spirits nor technology may sense her in any way except touch. The veil remains drawn until the time expires or the pendant is removed. To create this fetish, one must bind a Lune, a chameleon- spirit, a spirit of illusion, or a spirit of shadow into the pendant. Sanctuary Chimes[ ] Gnosis 6 When activated, this miniature tubular bell emits chimes into the wind. No spirit may materialize within 100 feet unless invited to do so. This fetish usually protects caerns or the homes of pregnant Kinfolk. One activation lasts for a full day. To create sanctuary chimes, one must bind a spirit of protection or a turtle-spirit into the tubular bell. Sun Whip[ ] Gnosis 7 This exotic fetish takes the form of a bullwhip with small nuggets of gold bound into the coil, weighted with a large nugget in the tip. The creator's tribal glyph (or occasionally family crest) is carved upon the base of the handle. When activated, the weapon glows slightly and erupts into either sunlight or flame upon making contact with a vampire. The whip does Strength + 4 aggravated damage against vampires, and Strength + 1 lethal damage against everything else. The difficulty to strike with it is 7, regardless. To create a sun whip, a spirit of flame or sunlight must be bound into the whip. Wind Whistle[ ] Gnosis 5 A single, long blow on this whistle will summon a freezing cold wind, laced with snow. It will cover the tracks of the werewolf using the whistle, and his pack if appropriate, while chilling the bones of any pursuers, costing them one die from every roll while they continue to pursue the owner of the wind whistle. The effects of the whistle last for one hour. To create a wind whistle, a wind elemental must be bound into a whistle carved from the bone of an animal that died of the cold during the winter months. Metamorphosis Inhibitors[ ] Gnosis 4; alternatively, Device 3 Gaia's guardians have always numbered among (and dealt in return) the chiefmost casualties of the centuries-old friction between Wyld and Weaver. Consequently, sinister constructs intended to injure and incarcerate the Changing Breed have matriculated into the dreams and dungeons of mankind since the dark days of Torquemada's Inquisition. The world has come a long way since that bygone era of silver manacles and spiked collars, however. Such devices now take on a microtechnological likeness - digital wristbands, latent intravenous agents, subdermal implants, and the like - skating a dangerous precedent towards malevolent Weaver-magic recognized, accepted, and utilized by the planet's mundane population. System: These cruel implements force their wearers into a single form (generally Homid), making it difficult and/or excrutiatingly painful for them to shift into others. Such unfortunates experience a +3 difficulty modifier to all shapeshifting rolls and suffer three aggravated wounds (soakable) every turn spent in another form (or trying to). Some few units are known to exist which restrain painlessly; sadly, they are rare. Raiden Unit[ ] Gnosis 7; alternately, Device 4 Some two or three dozen of these artifacts were allegedly constructed for Emperer Hirohito and his chiefmost generals during the dying days of World War Two. They consist of half-dollar-sized zinc inserts crafted to fit the palms of both hands. These inserts branch into hundred - thousands - of copper filaments, equally spaced in an unseen mesh around the wearer's body, which terminate in a three-pound rectangular controller worn against the small of the back. All components are exceedingly brittle and corrosion-sensitive, and must be carefully cleaned and maintained lest accidental discharge occur (a liability which did not endear the system for use in the field). The Raiden unit gathers and focuses ambient electricity (atmospheric ionization, static charge, even the surface tension from nearby liquids), projecting and/or releasing it upon command. The resulting shock is virtually like being hit by a lightning bolt. Those few Shadow Lords (Hakken or otherwise) who even remember these increasingly rare devices (as \"Mantles of Thunder\") revere them as holy relics. System: assume a maximum charge of ten damage dice (aggravated to most creatures), which may be discharged in whole or part at the user's option, and which replenishes at a rate of one die every other turn (faster in direct contact with a battery, generator or other power source). Effective range is fifteen feet; the player must roll straight-up Dexterity, difficulty 7 to hit (there aren't any skills that adequately represent accuracy with this thing). Conundrum[ ] Gnosis 7; alternately, Device 4 This pervasive programmer's suite (first marketed as \"Gotterdamerung\") first came to public attention after an auspicious maiden voyage which left Endron Oil's electronic infrastructure in smoldering ruins for an entire quarter. Billed by Warez e-zine as \"Mechagodzilla 2000,\" the package is already touted by many as the computational breakthrough the world has been waiting for - a new branch of problem-solving theory so advanced it will render all its predecessors' axioms and postulates obsolete. System: The Conundrum metavirus is both fiendishly simple and brutally unstoppable. Using a series of embedded libraries and subroutines, the user introduces a mathematical impossibility into an innocuous-seeming piece of carrier code (computer games, encoded BBS downloads, compressed image files or even electronic mail). This impossibility must be custom-tailored for the system in question (a geometric figure which cannot be represented in three-dimensional space would be sufficient to defeat a visual-recognition program, for example), and can be as simple or complex as dictated by the number of successes on an Intelligence + Computer roll, difficulty 7. (One success indicates a marginal attempt readily solved by a mainframe in a matter of minutes. Two successes may confound even advanced systems for hours or days, and three or more might cause a system-wide shutdown. Note that the user may not accumulate more successes on this roll than she has dots in the Enigmas Ability). What makes this hacker's superweapon so dangerous, in spite of its well-understood design and methodology, is the inherent difficulty in programming a computer to handle all possible computationally-unsolvable problems. (To make a long story short, it can't be done). As the situation now stands, the only defense against the Conundrum agent is a standalone computer network completely inaccessible from the outside world, or an automated kill switch which forces shutdown after a specified CPU-busy time period. The source code and design documentation behind the continually-changing hypermathematical Conundrum routines are known to only a select few cyber-anarchists 'Webwide, who keep their copies well-hidden among their most valuable (and secure) possessions. If a copy were to be leaked to the outside world, it would only be a matter of time before firewalls and anti-virus patches were countercoded - that is, until the next incarnation was released... OcClude[ ] Gnosis 6 A most unusual application from an entirely unexpected source, the OcClude encryptor was written and released by Fergus McClude, small-scale 'Web celebrity Theurge of the Fianna, perhaps the only member of his tribe in all of Ireland whose affinity for computers outweighed his passion for dance or drink. Like its contemporaries (RSA, SSL, Triple-DES, half a hundred other compression/encryption packages), OcClude encodes material from the prying eyes of others. Unlike its contemporaries, OcClude can encode almost anything - digital or material. Using this program, electronic items (files/folders) and/or physical presences (objects, even living creatures) can be removed from sight - removed from view, made harder to find without a code key, hidden from the Desktop, as it were. Not long after releasing this software to the 'Web, McClude disappeared from public reckoning, both on- and off-line. Did he assume another identity? Run afoul of a Pentex ICS strike team? Or succeed in encrypting himself? The Irishman's legends loom larger than he ever did... System: A Computer + Intelligence roll (difficulty 6 for files, 7 for objects, 8 for living tissue) must be made to successfully encrypt the item in question (which immediately disappears from view, suspended in some null-state or Umbral pocket-Realm, unaging, unaware, and, when decrypted, will reappear exactly where it previously vanished). Large or complex objects may require multiple successes, at the Storyteller's option, while botches - well, we'll just leave that to your discretion. OcClude can even encrypt intangible things such as sensations or memories, given certain materials and preparation (one example might include EEG equipment, an appropriate computer interface, extensive knowledge of Computer, Electronics, and Medicine). Adjust time and/or required successes accordingly for delicate operations. Plethora[ ] Gnosis 5 Introduced in early 1980s contraceptive-conscious North America, wonder drug in a society brimming with wonder drugs, this innocuous pink capsule is called blessing by some, curse by others. There are those among the Thirteen Tribes who see Plethora as nothing short of a miracle, a promise of deliverance from the End Times; others, however, see it as heresy - deliberate violation of the Litany, a step closer to fulfullment of the Prophecy of Phoenix - and herald to the inevitable Apocalypse. This powerful vituperative tips the reproductive scales in favor of the Garou genome. Whereas the Gift normally breeds true in approximately one-tenth of Garou/non-Garou couplings, children conceived under the influence of Plethora have proven far more likely to undergo their First Change. (Limited data culled from the first generation to reach puberty indicates an emergence ratio hovering around 50% or even higher). Such ephiphany is not without its price, however. Plethora children (whether Garou or Kinfolk) are almost unilaterally born sterile and disfigured, either physically, or emotionally, or both (treat as metis) and may not possess the Past Life or Pure Breed Backgrounds. (The spirit-stuff running through their veins is wholy external and symbiotic in nature, and not inherited from any Garou parent). Further those few Garou-Garou offspring spawned from this dubious reproductive aid are grotesque monsters (treat as metis, but add one additional disfigurement per parent using Plethora). Such travesties are generally incapable of living unassisted, and are euthanized at birth. No one will take credit for this left-handed gift to Garou society, although it is almost unquestionably the handiwork of the Glass Walkers, who have advocated strengthening their numbers by any means possible for decades. RDX[ ] Gnosis 5 Newest entrant into a field of designer drugs, procreative poisons, and synthetic stimulants, this adaptive neruotoxin is almost assuredly the handiwork of an acronym-obsessive government agency - though its precise parentage (Developmental Neogenetics Amalgamated, M17 Operation Clarity, Project Twilight, or another as-yet unseen powerplayer) will likely lie forever hidden beneath a mountain of paperwork. Whatever its origin, RDX kills - and its remarkably good at what it does. System: RDX (cryptically referred to as \"Unweaver\" by some spirit-sighted Uktena) is a chemical assassin - a swift, sure agent which, once introduced into a target's bloodstream, ferrets out it's strengths weaknesses, and metabolic idiosyncrasies, then acts accordingly to eliminate with a minimum of muss and fuss. (The poison induces cardiac arrhythmia, electrolytic imbalance, and similarly inobvious symptoms in human hosts, resulting in seemingly-natural fatalities. Garou and others of the Changing Breed succumb to argyrosis (a greyish-bluing of the cornea and nails caused by silver deposits in the body, often fatal), and the only pack of vampires known to have unwittingly fed from human carriers experienced several hours of manic anxiety and insatiable hunger before lapsing into a torpid state). Although fearsome in its ability to adapt and overcome, the retrovirus is in its comparative infancy, and can still occasionally be fought off. Victims' immune systems may attempt to resist (toxin inflicts (10-Stamina) Health Levels (soakable as aggravated) during the first turn, weakening by one Health Level per turn thereafter until metabolized (reduced to zero) or victorious (causing death/Torpor to the target) -- subsequent reintroduction to RDX, however, will result in a (cumulative) + 1 penalty to future soak rolls. Feather of Ma'at[ ] Gnosis 5 Originally a creation of the Silent Striders, the Striders have been known to share this fetish with Half-Moons of other tribes who've been a great aid to Owl's children. the feather can be of various forms, from an ostrich plume to a raven's quill. When a Philodox is speaking to someone, she \"applies\" the feather against the truth of their speech by tossing it into the air. If the feather sinks to the earth, it \"weighs\" more than the words of the person speaking; they are being truthful. However, if the speaker is lying, the feather remains floating; their words are too \"heavy.\" Should the werewolf using the feather fail to activate it, the default is that the feather falls to the ground...and she may not realize she's hearing lies. Monkey's Tongue[ ] Gnosis 7 Despite the name, this is rarely made from a tongue (though when it is, a human tongue is commonly used). Just as often, the Garou binds a spirit associated with language - a parrot or magpie, or sometimes a Weaver-spirit - into a book or some other innocuous item. When activated, the fetish translates one language into a tongue of the Garou's choice for the rest of the scene. The fetish only works on one language at a time, so it can't simultaneously translate French and Spanish. It does, however, work both ways - the Garou appears to be speaking in the targeted language, even if he doesn't speak a word of it. This fetish can translate human languages into the Garou tongue. No one speaking in the targeted language notices the difference; if a Garou uses this fetish to translate German into English, he hears English when others speak German, but anything speaking in German doesn't notice anything out of the ordinary Fomerol[ ] Gnosis 5 This drug is actually constituted from the bodies of \"recycled\" fomorach. When injected into a fomor, it temporarily boosts his Powers. However, it is highly addictive, and the fomor will crave more. After injection, the fomor rolls to activate the fetish. If successful, the effects of any Power he uses are doubled (i.e., claws and fangs do more damage, Mind Bending is easier to use, etc.). After even one use, however, (regardless of whether it was successfully activated or not) the character will suffer from the Taint: addiction (cycle: once per month), until he gets more Fomorol. Unlike a full-blown addiction, however, once a full cycle has passed without Fomorol, the character's need for the drug disappears - unless he uses it again. Putty Buddy[ ] Gnosis 5 Putty Buddy is a Bane fetish distributed to fomori in the service of Pentex. What can it do? Oh, what can't it do?! It stretches, it bounces, it picks up cartoons. If molded over another person's face and then over the fomor's own it will allow the fomor to take on the other's appearance (face only, for one scene). One egg's worth can be stretched out to over 50' long, creating a rope for quick getaways, or to bind one's enemies. If thrown at any target not in the service of the Wyrm, it will entangle the victim (Strength - 5). A thousand more uses. Putty Buddies can only be destroyed by fire. They scream as they burn. Vibro-Blade[ ] Gnosis 5 This blade is the result of the fusion of a corrupted electricity elemental and a bladed weapon. These weapons are extremely experimental, and few in number. When the fetish is activated, the elemental creates a charge around the blade, causing a low hum and vibration on the knife blade. When thrust into a target, theoretically a discharge of electrical energy will occur, causing three Health Levels of aggravated damage in addition to any damage the knife inflicts. The knife itself is still in an experimental phase. Pentex has had trouble fusing elemental spirits with the knives itself, and has found it works best on fighting knives or shortswords. Unfortunately, they have not learned to control the charge with 100% accuracy, and some unfortunate accidents have happened to those wielding the blade. |Roll||Difficulty||Damage||Conceal| |By Weapon||By Weapon||+3||By weapon| Aggravated Damage The wearer of a Cavern Torc is blessed when traveling beneath Gaia's surface and exploring her womb; cave systems become safe harbors for her. When the Cavern Torc is worn, the Garou can see in pitch-blackness as well as she could on a cloudy day. In ways, she can see even farther; her senses extend about twenty meters in all directions, while underground. She can sense foes hidden around the bend in a tunnel, or see through a minor cave-in. The torc even works when beneath the earth in modern structures; should a Garou wearing it penetrate the basement of a Wyrm-infested skyscraper, she will benefit from its abilities there. The Cavern Torc only fails if the Gauntlet rises to 9 or above. These fetishes are created with the help of various cavern spirits, such as bat-spirits, mole-spirits or earth elementals. Coin Reader[ ] Gnosis 3 The Sisterhood first developed fetishes of this nature as early as the sixteenth century; the fetish tracks money backward, to see who owned it previously. Early versions of this fetish are pairs of scales with a quil pen and inkwell; a coin is placed on one side of the scales and the pen leaps up and writes the names of the last seven people who touched it. More modern versions of the fetish have a small platter and a receipt-style printer, but the effect is the same - and note that all versions of these fetishes can track paper money as easily as they do coinage. Electronic transfers, being purely in the realm of the Weaver, cannot be tracked with this fetish. This fetish was first created when a Sisterhood pack found itself to be receiving a great deal of Wyrm-tainted coinage; they had no easy way to track the money backward, and found that they inadvertently intimidated shopkeepers they interrogated. Certain Gifts and Wyrm-powers can conceal past owners' identities. Rumors abound of a version of this fetish that continues to track coins for a few days after they leave the fetish; they write out names as the coin goes from owner to owner for a week or so. Such a fetish would surely have a higher Gnosis requirement than that of an \"ordinary\" coin reader. These fetishes are crafted by binding spirits of avarice. Bow of Artemis[ ] Gnosis 5 A Bow of Artemis is usuable only by a Maiden Black Fury. It is the perfect hunting bow, giving its wielder +4 dice to her Survival dice pools when using it to hunt for food. In battle, it grants its wielder +2 dice to her Archery dice pool, and causes those arrows that strike their targets to do two extra dice of lethal damage. The bow is crafted by binding any spirit of Pegasus' brood within. Labrys[ ] Gnosis 7 A fetish labrys is much like the standart double-headed axe of the same name. However, thanks to the war-spirit bound within, it inflicts aggravated damage, not lethal. Pandora's Box[ ] Gnosis 6 In ancient myth, Pandora had a box full of the ills of mankind; as she was unstoppably curious, she did open it and they were released to hassle humanity for all time. This fetish is ironically named for that woman, though it can be used to trap and release Banes - the ills of mankind embodied. The Box can hold up to ten Wyrm-spirits at a time. To trap a spirit, the Fury bound to the Box must point its keyhole at the spirit and speak a command word in ancient Greek. The box then rolls its Gnosis in a contest against the spirit's current Rage; the target is 6 for both Box and Bane. If the Box gets more successes, the Bane is trapped; if the Bane gets as many or more successes, it is free and Pandora's Box cannot be used on it again that day. If, for some reason, the Fury wishes to let one or more Banes free, she need only to open the lid of Pandora's Box. She must make a Wits roll and achieve 3 successes in order to release just one Bane; fewer than 3 successes means that extra Banes escape, one per success. A botch on this roll frees all the Banes in the box. If she gets the 3 successes, the one Bane that escapes will be the one that has been in the Box for longest. This fetish is made by binding any spirit with entrapement powers within; usually spider-spirits or spirits of crafts are preferred. Hitching Glove[ ] Gnosis 6 One size fits all - this fetish is a worn glove with extra padding around the thumb. By activating the fetish, the wearer can determine the best place within a city block for hitching a ride. The Garou can flag down a passing ride with a Perception + Streetwise roll (difficulty 8). Whether the ride is headed in the right direction depends on the number of successes. One success denotes numerous detours and delays; the ride doesn't go all the way to the hitchhiker's destination. Five successes indicate that a friendly driver will go out of his way to accommodate his passenger. The roll isn't made until the passenger gets into the vehicle, since a botch indicates a dangerous encounter. Once in the company of the stranger driving the car, the hitchhiker is on his own. Mirror of Princes[ ] Gnosis 7 This precious treasure is a mirror of bronze with two faces. It was created by the Golden Heart Sept in the time of Christine de Pisan, and serves as a corrective to the vanity of earthly rulers. When the mirror's user holds up one face, anyone looking into the mirror sees the worst thing that she has ever done, or the worst thing that is true about herself, and cannot deny or escape this. The other face brings knowledge about the best in oneself. The Storyteller should invent uses for this mirror. Comforter of the Architect[ ] Gnosis 5 This is a bedquilt made from scraps of old clothes and embroidered with ancient Garou designs. A Jaggling of the powerful spirit called the Architect of Sleep is stitched into the quilt. Any Garou sleeping in the quilt may pass one of her Abilities to a packmate. Before going to sleep, she speaks to the packmate about the Ability (a \"bedtime story\"), and then while she is truly asleep the packmate will possess the Ability in question. To activate the fetish, Garou makes a Wits + Expression roll, with the difficulty being the packmate's Willpower, and spends a Gnosis point. If the situation is stressful, the Storyteller may force the sleeper to make a Willpower roll against her own Willpower to fall asleep. The Ability can be one that the packmate does not have, but cannot be one totally alien to the recipient; for instance, a human cannot be lent Primal-Urge. Pilgrim's Staff[ ] Gnosis 7 This staff supports pilgrims (either Garou or Kin) as they trek from place to place on great peace pilgrimages. The Brighton Caern was the first to bear such staves in the modern world, although the Children carried them long ago. When the pilgrim begins his journey, the staff is a simple wooden or bamboo stick, with a spirit of travel bound within. The pilgrim must walk from caern to caern across the land. At each caern that the pilgrin visits, speaking out for peace and gathering followers, artisans among the Kinfolk carve the caern's symbols into the staff and attach ribbons and banners and so on with the caern's colors and signs (Caerns may choose not to participate). When the pilgrim finally arrives at his goal, he will have one extra die to use in peacemaking rolls (of any sort) for each caern represented; these extra dice last for one day per caern represented. Some such pilgrims have wandered for years; Janine Olive-Branches an elderly Garou from France, has walked for four decades collecting caern tokens against the War of the Apocalypse.... Torc of Wisdom[ ] Gnosis 5 When activated, the torc increases the wearer's permanent Willpower or Gnosis (each torc is dedicated to one or the other; a level four fetish might have the power to increase either one at a time) by one point until the end of the scene. A spirit of wisdom empowers the fetish. Spearskin[ ] Gnosis 6 One of the more unusual possessions of the Get of Fenris, this fetish appears to be the cured hide of a large boar. Those septs with a speaskin in their possession typically use it to fortify their septs in times of trouble. To activate it, the owner must shake it out as if it were a rug or blanket. As he does so, a number of stout oaken spears equal to the number of successes on the activation check tumble out. The spears may appear with or without iron heads; those without are quite effective for fighting vampires. The skin may be used as often as the owner likes, although if the activation roll is botched, the skin ceases to function for a week. Spears created by this fetish vanish at the next sunrise. A werewolf must bind a spirit of war, iron or oak into the skin of a boar to create such a fetish. Big Black Book[ ] Gnosis 6 A personal favorite of many a Corporate Wolf or other contact-minded Glass Walker; this pocket-sized book contains the phone number of every single mortal person on Earth that has one. It is all written in the owner's handwriting. Curiously enough, a spirit of humor is bound into this fetish. Crescent Moon Waterskin[ ] Gnosis 5 Still popular among female Middle Eastern Glass Walkers, this fetish was used to disguise female warriors in jihad. A Rage or war-spirit is bound into the waterskin. By pouring the water onto her claws, the Glass Walker gains the benefits of the Razor Claws Gift. Alternatively, by pouring the water on a normal blade she can allow it to do aggravated damage, or by drinking it she can immediately frenzy. Only one of these affects may be in play at any one time, and the effects last for a scene. Personal Reserves[ ] Gnosis 6 Sometimes, there just aren't enough bullets. This Cyberfetish consists of a long metal tube that goes into the Glass Walkers stomach through his side. This tube can then be inserted into a specially-made firearm. Once the clip in the firearm is exhausted, the Glass Walker can literlly feed his own Rage or Gnosis into the gun to reload it, one point for each full reload. The bullets are formed and then stored inside the Glass Walker's stomach Jambiya[ ] Gnosis 5 The fetish jambiya is most often a klaive forged in a form that pays homage to the Silent Strider heritage. The blade of a jambiya is curved, but it lacks the bottom point that would form the full crescent. Both edges of the blade are sharpened. Like the d'siah, it is typically used to slash with the outer edge, but the upswept point can be used to cut into the opponent with a backwards stroke. A fetish jambiya is forged from pure silver, and in larger proportions than ever created for a human wielder -- roughly four inches wide at its broadest, and about eighteen inches long, though it loses some of its reach to the curve of the blade. The knife is heavy in Homid form, but a wielder with a Strength of 2 and 1 point in Melee can handle it with one hand. Because of the relatively short reach of the weapon and skill required to wield it effectively, the difficulty to hit with a jambiya is 7. A successful strike with the fetish does Strength aggravated damage. Because of the large quantities of silver used to make the blade, the wielders effective Gnosis rating is reduced by one while she carries the knife. Latyr Stone[ ] Gnosis 6 These small, unremarkable rocks can make the difference between life and death for a Silver Fang in hostile territory. Once a werewolf activates the stone and places it on the ground or in a body of water, it will purify the nearby plants and water enough to ensure that they are safe for the werewolf to eat and drink. Each stone will purify enough food and water for a single pack. A character can create a latyr stone by binding a water elemental into a stone taken from a river running through a caern's bawn. Moon Bow[ ] Gnosis 7 A Moon Bow appears as a short or longbow of dark wood, with glyphs for each of the moon phases carved on it. The bow shoots more accurately in the light of the moon; even when the moon appears during the day. To attune the bow initially, the Garou must fire an arrow at the moon, spend a point of Gnosis and succeed in a Gnosis roll (difficulty 7). If successful, the bow is attuned to her until she gives it away. When shooting in the moon's light, she makes another Gnosis check (difficulty depends on the moon's phase; use Rage roll difficulties, i.e., 8 for new moon, 4 for full); every two successes add an extra die to the attack roll for that shot. A Lune or other moon spirit empowers the bow. Coin of Wealth[ ] Gnosis 8 Most of these fetishes take the form of an ancient gold coin, but some recent versions look like battered credit or ATM cards. When rubbed (and activated), the Coin brings its patron wealth\u2014not necessarily money, but the resources the Garou needs to complete the tasks before him. The number of successes on the Gnosis roll should be the guideline to the level of assistance granted. These fetishes tend to lose their effectiveness if overused. Every time the fetish is used during the same story, the coin should get progressively more difficult to use and its effects should become smaller and smaller. To create this fetish, one of the following spirit types must be bound into the coin or card: Wealth, Trickster or Earth Dream Trap[ ] Gnosis 8 These fetishes resemble the Native American objects, although they can take a multitude of forms, from metal wire to intricately woven spidersilk. The fetish surrounds a sleeper's bed, where it catches any Umbral spirits attempting to disturb or harm the sleeper. The spirit must roll its Gnosis versus the fetish's Gnosis or become trapped. To create a Dream Trap, one of the following spirit types must be bound into the matrix: Dream, Sleep or Spider. Gaia's Poultice[ ] Gnosis 8 This rough-woven, herb-treated bandage has remarkable healing properties. When placed on a wound and activated, the bandage heals a number of wounds (even aggravated ones) equal to the number of successes rolled. The bandage must be kept in a special pouch, or it loses its potency. It can be used on any given person only once during a scene. To create a Poultice, one of the following spirit types must be bound into the bandage: Healing, Unicorn or Snake. Key to the Umbra[ ] Gnosis 7 This fetish is a small key that reduces the strength of the Gauntlet. For every two activation successes, the local Gauntlet drops by 1. The key is usually worn around the \"neck. Any Gaian spirit can power the Key, so long as the spirit isn't tied to one location Loon's Refund[ ] Gnosis 8 This nondescript ATM card was created by a Glass Walker Theurge named Loon. This fetish can be used to withdraw funds from any ATM machine. The money withdrawn equals activation successes x $100. Characters who use this fetish more than once a day run the risk of drawing attention to themselves. To create this fetish, one of the following spirit types must be bound into the card: Wealth, Electricity or Weaver Sands of Sleep[ ] Gnosis 6 This fetish takes the form of a small bag made from a black material and filled with a fine powder that is absorbed when it comes into contact with liquids or solids. When activated, the bag must be swung open-end-first toward the target, striking him with the \"sand.\" The target must make a Willpower roll versus the fetish's Gnosis or fall into a deep sleep for one hour. To create this fetish, one of the following spirit types must be bound into the bag: Sleep, Dream, Calm or Night. Shard of Despair[ ] Gnosis 5 This fetish is a small spike of goethite (a crystalline rust). When driven carefully into the floor (Dexterity + Repair, difficulty 7, or it shatters) and activated, the shard afflicts everyone within the area with despair for the duration of one scene. Each person in the area must roll his or her Gnosis versus that of the fetish to resist an overwhelming depression; individuals without Gnosis can roll Willpower, but the difficulty rises to 9. Bone Gnawers often use this fetish as a security measure. To create a Shard, one of the following spirit types must be bound into the goethite: Despair, Pain, Night or Fear Spirit Bell and Candles[ ] Gnosis 8 This fetish consists of a small bell and two candlesticks. When candles are placed into the sticks on either side of the bell, and the bell is struck, all spirits are drawn and bound to the location of the candles. These spirits are unable to act as long as the note peals ( three minutes per activation success ) . The local Gauntlet in the area is reduced by 2 as well. Any spirit servant of Uktena or Falcon can empower this fetish. Tongue of the Leech[ ] Gnosis 8 This fetish is fashioned from the dried tongue of a vampire. It can heal a number of aggravated wounds equal to the number of successes gained by rolling the fetish's Gnosis versus the target's Rage. A botch means the tongue burrows into the target's flesh to seek blood, thus causing another aggravated wound. Snake-spirits, Death-spirits and even a few Wyrmspirits can power this fetish. Level Four[ ] Feathered Cloak[ ] Gnosis 8 A highly difficult fetish to make, requiring thousands of differently colored feathers, a feathered cloak can take years to create, but the end results are spectacular not only in function but in form. Properly made, the cloak shows a dazzling array of different colors and patterns, and it is said that gazing on one for three days without wavering in one's attention makes it possible to see the road of life itself in the pattern of feathers. This may or may not be true, but what is certain is the spectacular effect the fetish provides: The wearer can fly. When activated, the wearer can rise above the ground and travel horizontally at speeds equivalent to her running speed. The flight is not perfect, however. The wearer cannot travel both horizontally and vertically at the same time, and vertical travel is considerably slower, progressing at walking speed. Finally, the entire experience causes a great deal of stress upon the body. For every ten minutes of flight, the player must roll Stamina with Athletics as retest (difficulty 5). If the roll fails, then the pain from the stress has become too intense and the wearer needs to land and rest. The feathered cloak is a full-length cloak that remains wrapped around the body, even during flight, and is bound with a bird-spirit. Ironhammer[ ] Gnosis 5 Lesser versions of the mighty Jarlhammers, these onehanded hammers are potent war fetishes in their own right, and the signature weapons of the Get of Fenris. Forged of silver-laced iron, an ironhammer inflicts Strength +2 aggravated damage; Garou can soak these wounds, as the silver content is overwhelmed by the iron. A werewolf may hurl an Ironhammer up to 10 yards for every point of Strength; the hammer returns to its rightful owner after each toss. To create an ironhammer, a spirit of war must be bound into a mighty hammer forged of silver-laced iron Klaive[ ] Gnosis 6 The signature weapon of the Garou Nation, klaives are fetish daggers of a singular design, made to be used in Homid, Glabro, or Crinos form with equal ease. Klaives are rare weapons made from the purest silver, treasured and passed down from hero to hero. A werewolf who carries a klaive loses one point from his effective Gnosis rating, thanks to the silver. A war-spirit is usually bound into the klaive, allowing it to inflict aggravated damage even to non-Garou foes. Pulling a klaive on another werewolf is considered a grave action, for a klaive duel is almost always to the death. Nonetheless, such duels have always been dangerously common, and this practice shows no sign of abating even in the Final Days. Elders complain that too many of these sacred artifacts are in the ranks of reckless youths quick to use them for mundane tasks or to spill kin-blood; young werewolves argue that too many klaives are kept hidden away for rituals and great quests, when they could be better put to use against Black Spiral Dancers and other foes. The difficulty to attack with a klaive is 6, and it inflicts Strength + 2 aggravated damage. Werewolves cannot soak this damage unless in their breed form. Labrys of Isthmene[ ] Gnosis 7 A labrys of Isthmene a massive, double-headed waraxe dedicated to Isthmene, the Gorgon of battle. A signature weapon of the Black Furies, the weapon is designed to be wielded two-handed, but may be effectively used with one hand by any being with Strength 6 or higher. Attacks made with the labrys are difficulty 7, and do Strength + 4 aggravated damage. Activating the fetish grants access to the Gift: Spirit of the Fray for the rest of the scene. The fetish will not function for a male Garou of any tribe. To create a labrys of Isthmene, one must bind a spirit of war into the labrys. Monkey Puzzle[ ] Gnosis 6 This amber talisman contains a single human hair. When activated, it causes all humans viewing the werewolf to believe her to be a normal human... regardless of the form she wears. However, the fetish doesn't mask her actions \u2014 tearing out someone's throat simply becomes the act of a cannibalistic lunatic rather than a werewolf. This fetish's effects last for a day. To create a monkey puzzle, one must bind a ghost, a spirit of illusion, or a trickster-spirit into the talisman. Spirit Whistle[ ] Gnosis 8 When activated and blown, this ivory whistle emits a wailing scream that causes great pain to all spirits within the werewolf's line of sight. Any spirits present must roll Gnosis and beat the fetish's activation roll, or be compelled to flee from the scream. The power of this fetish is directional; spirits behind the werewolf don't have to roll Gnosis. To create a spirit whistle, one must bind a screechowl spirit, a spirit of madness, or a spirit of discord into the ivory whistle. Personal Umbral Digital Application[ ] Gnosis 8 The Glass Walkers have, on occasion, a compulsion to create devices that could best be described as \"cute,\" and most would argue the PUDA more or less fits that category. This is because most people have not been subject to the devastating array of forces that the PUDA can bring to bear. Effectively, the PUDA is a digital platform with a bee-spirit bound into it. In the past, this fetish took the form of palmtop digital assistants or powerbooks; modern iterations of the fetish are generally cell phones or digital tablets. This bee spirit creates a hive file structure in an Umbral space around the device, which can store and organize various rites before completion and then \"execute\" the rite at a later time. The Glass Walker simply has to use the PUDA to \"record\" the rite in some fashion, such as with a camera application. When finished, the rite does not have any effect, but (if successful) is then stored in the PUDA and can have its effect come to pass with the click of a touch-sensitive pad any time thereafter. Each activation can execute one rite, but if the roll fails, the rite is lost. If the roll for the rite depends upon outside factors, then all rolls are made when the rite is executed rather than when it is first performed to be stored. The following rites work with a PUDA: Rite of Cleansing, Rite of Contrition, Rite of Binding, Rite of the Questing Stone, Rite of Talisman Dedication, Rite of Becoming, Rite of Spirit Awakening, Rite of Summoning, Voice of the Jackal, and Rending of the Veil. At the Storyteller's option, other more obscure rites may be compatible as well. Each rite stored on the PUDA requires some spiritual energy to be preserved, which is taken from the Glass Walker using it in the form of a single temporary point of Gnosis. This Gnosis does not restore in the usual manner, but is returned the moment that a rite is successfully executed. If the execution fails and the rite is lost, the Gnosis goes with it, but may be regained in the usual fashion. On top of all this, the PUDA also works as a normal digital device. Unbroken Cord[ ] Gnosis 6 This appears to be a length of hemp cord knotted and braided into elaborate patterns. Lengths vary, but there will usually be enough to make necklaces, belts, etc., for an entire pack. When the pack leader wishes, she may spend one Gnosis point and share one of her abilities, such as a Gift or skill, with any pack member. She can only share with as many pack members as she has current Gnosis. One use for this is to share skills or abilities; another is to aid pack members by giving them the leader's Rage or Gnosis. The effects last for one scene. To create an unbroken cord, one must bind a unityspirit (such as the spirit of a flock of birds) into the cord ShadowSim Projector[ ] Gnosis 7 Shinzui Industries introduced their KageMono (\"ShadowWare\") series prototype in the early 1990s, taking advantage of unprecedented private-sector interest in affordable VR (Virtual Reality) hardware. Their efforts, though eclipsed by an insurgence of copycat enterprises hoping to mimic the Japanese megacorp's accomplishments, were not overlooked by the technological elite: \"The battle has been joined,\" Scientific Monitor headlines proclaimed, \"to take human consciousness to new worlds.\" None of them -- not even the highest tiers of Shinzui research and development - knew just how close they had come to the truth. Cleverly disguised as cutting-edge realtime-rendered VR equipment, the Shinzui apparatus actually serves as an elaborate platform for Umbral travel. The unorthodox transport mechanism seems to feed on Weaver-energies, flourishing in places of stasis and structure. The dozen or so functional models known to exist across Europe, North America, and Asia conform to two basic configurations - conveyances (vehicles identical in appearance to full-body VR cradles) and projectors (hundreds of sophisticated sensor high-fidelity multimedia systems (flatscreens, wide-spectrum speakers, three-dimensional holographic displays, and the like)). At least one variant of this fetish (the Ernhardt Engine, a Danish competitor's clone) has been demonstrated to operate in reverse, projecting Umbral objects (and possibly creatures) into the physical plane. Is it possible for WeaverTech to bridge the gap between Gaia and the ungifted? And what purpose does it serve, considering that the Weaver was responsible for the rise of the Gauntlet in the first place? What does this apparent change of heart (from an entity that's the antithesis of change) signify? The air is rife with speculation... System: Obvious advantages to Garou users include stationary transit (the user's body remains suspended in a spheroid rig, leaving her spiritual self to wander the Umbra untethered), removal of the need for a reflective surface, and the contingency for disconnection at a moment's notice (through direct command, automated kill-switches, and/or vigilant assistants), instantaneously returning to the material realm at a known point of emergence (but at some risk to mind and body - roll Stamina vs. difficulty 7 to avoid catatonia, insanity, or worse). Similarly, this system is much easier to use in areas of high Weaver density; use the table below to determine the difficulty for stepping sideways with invasive retrovirus is named for its homeworld, the seventh Near Realm theorized and discovered by Garou Voidseekers during the Second Renaissance of Man (early sixteenth century) which explorers now call the CyberRealm. One could argue that this devilsh agent tries to help its hosts - it does keep them alive, after all - offering them virtual immortality at terrible cost. System: Once ingested (willingly or unwillingly) by a subject possessing the Gaian genome (Garou, Kinfolk, others of the Changing Breed), the ReGen parasite triggers a subtle metamorphosis in its consumer's metabolic and regenerative systems. Under the influence of ReGen 7, the host's body quickly and efficiently repairs any and all damage (even fatal damage) it sustains, short of decapitation or outright disintegration. (The parasite's healing factor outpaces that of the Changing Breed (one Health Level per turn, resting or active), and even overcomes wounds wrought by silver, a fact which perplexes the scientific-minded among the thirteen tribes). Such healing can hardly be considered natural, however. The injured body draws from the nearest source of inorganic material, lashing out with grotesque pseudopodia and sealing its wounds with whatever substance is immediately available. (The parasite prefers silicon (and absorbs a volume equal to that of the open wound), but will accept metals, plastics, and even radioactive isotopes (in that order), albeit to a lesser degree of efficiency (double or triple the necessary amount). Regeneration will not occur in the absence of suitable fuel.) The healing process, although remarkable, is uncomfortable in the extreme - accounts vary from a sikening pulling sensation to excrutiating pain exceeding that of the initial wound - and, over a sufficient stretch of time, dehumanizing (Longtime users ('sufferers' might be a better word choice) experience eventual detachment/psychoses (select appropriate Derangements) and eventual suicide, or, still worse, become mechanized patchwork zombies, devoted to spreading the alien affliction). No natural (or supernatural) remedy has yet been found to purge the infestation; only death or as-yet untested methods (mind-body transplant, sympathetic magick, direct Celestine intervention or perhaps the cleansing flames of Erebus) yield escape. A splinter faction of mages calling themselves \"Progenitors\" are suspected to encode an evolved specimen of this nanogen into its supersoldiers. Further, a watered-down off-shoot has apparently made its own way across the Gauntlet, acclimated to human hosts and made its presence known on city streets - this retrograde pharmaceutical, known as \"Archangel,\" induces superhuman strength, murderous frenzy and eventual death through adrenal overload in its users. Loki's Fire[ ] Gnosis 7 This fetish usually appears as a fiery red stone about the size of a human's palm, similar in color to a carnelian. When activated with the expenditure of a Gnosis point (a simple roll will not activate a fetish of this potency), it allows the wielder to raise her Manipulation by two points for the duration of a scene. Ideally, the user takes this opportunity to successfully perform a prank or somehow use the advantage in a way the stone's namesake would approve. A spirit of deceit is often the source of the fetish's power. Storyglass[ ] Gnosis 6 A storyglass can be an ordinary pocket mirror, shard of glass or other reflective surface (as long as it's not silver!) When activated, the user speaks a specific question to the glass, such as \"Show me who stole my klaive.\" A brief, silent image will appear. Such flashes can be misleading, as they don't often give a complete picture of what occured and why. The images also reflect \"visible\" reality; if someone is wearing a disguise, that's what the viewer sees, not the person under the mask. Images in a storyglass aren't hard and fast evidence for moots or rites of punishment, but they can point a Philodox in a useful direction. Lash of the Furies[ ] Gnosis 8 These whips are ancient barbed cats o' nine tails. They are alleged to have been cut from the intestines of a great Wyrm-creature, though some suggest that it might have been the Nemean Lion. This is only likely because the Lion was emphatically a chtonic creatures of earth defeated by the male god Heracles, and using its innards as a pain fetish suits the ironic nature of a Fury Crone. These whips are used for punishment or even torture, not combat. A hit from one of the Lashes - only five exist - does Strength +3 aggravated damage, with a soak difficulty of 9. Wounds from the Lash leave permanent scars; Furies can make a Perception + Occult roll, difficulty 8 to attempt to recognize the distinctive scars the Lash makes -- two successes are necessary for this. Spirits inside the Lash ferret out the target's guilty secrets on a successful hit, and relay this information to the Fury using the whip unless the target rolls more Willpower successes (at a difficulty of 9) than he took wound levels. The Lash of the Furies is not soley used on Wyrm-creatures; it has been used on intransigent Garou of other tribes, but those Garou are rarely allowed to return alive to their tribemates. It is known that Kelonoke Wildhair has a Lash of the Furies in her possession, and that its tender caresses are the least of the agonies that a male Garou who sets foot near the Furies' home caern will feel. Spirit Radio[ ] Gnosis 7 Don't touch that dial...unless you're prepared to deal with the consequences. The spirit radio is a battered little portable that runs off a dead battery. Recharging it at a caern imbues the fetish with enough Gnosis for seven uses. Activating the fetish tunes into the communications of spirits within a city block. Tuning the dial gives a rapid montage announcing all sorts of spiritual activity in the neighborhood. Any Fera or Garou listening can attune to a broadcast (even without the Spirit Speech Gift) and gather what kinds of spirits are nearby. This sounds like squealing or static to everyone else listening. Each attuned listener gets his own image of what the spirits are like, but identifying them precisely requires a Wits + Occult roll (difficulty 7). The user can then tune into any one spirit within range, hearing a report on what the spirit senses and encounters for up to one scene. If the user has any \"requests\", the spirit radio reduces the difficulty of calling the spirit (with a Summoning Rite) by 2. Carnyx of Victory[ ] Gnosis 7 The Carnyx appears as a tall horn with an animal head at the end. When sounded, it fills the air with a weird, discordant braying that heartens allies and strikes fear into the hearts of the foe. When successfully activated, each success to a Manipulation + Performance roll (difficulty 8) adds one die to the dice pools of all comrades. The effect continues for as long as the Fiann sounds the horn. Requires a war spirit. Spear of Len[ ] Gnosis 6 There are only a handful of these weapons known to exist. Named for a legendary smith who made the first of its kind (used by Fionn mac Cumhail himself), it usually appears as a spear with a head of perpetually cold bluish steel. When pressed hard against the forehead, the spear keeps the warrior from being muddled or lulled by magics, whether vampiric, fae, mage or Garou in nature. This is not a general mental defense effect, but does cover mental illusions and sleep spells. At the Storyteller's discretion, a Willpower roll may be necessary against particularly powerful threats. Naturally, one can't fight with the spear and use its power simultaneously. Creating such a spear requires the spirit of a north wind. Torc of the Wolf[ ] Gnosis 7 This powerful fetish typically appears as a heavy gold torc, made with nine gold braids (each made with nine gold wires), the ends capped by golden wolfheads with bared fangs. When activated, the torc allows its wearer to shift forms instantly without spending Rage for the duration of the scene. Body Reformation Engine[ ] Gnosis 7 Blatantly abusing the werewolf's ability to regenerate and shapeshift, this complex system of nanotech grinders spread throughout the Glass Walker's body deliberately destroys their physical form whilst a hormonal injection stops regeneration returning the body to its natural state but instead rebuilds the body in its new state. By doing this, the Garou can extend limbs out to ridiculous lengths, completely redesign their physical shape (height, weight, etc.), turn their body into a single long snakelike tube, or any other number of tricks. Ultimate Search Engine[ ] Gnosis 6 While finding something on the Internet is best done with a normal search engine, anything off the Internet should be handled with this. This program, bound with a cockroach spirit, can find literally anything (so long as its location is in the physical world) and display its location on a monitor. To search, it rolls its own Gnosis with a difficulty set by the Storyteller, depending on how difficult the object is to find. Finding a misplaced wallet is about difficulty 6; finding one of the lost Talons of the Wyrm would be difficulty 10, if not impossible. As a result, this is not considered the most reliable Softwere on Earth, but if you're the kind of guy who keeps forgetting where he put his glasses you'll love it. Bramble Branch[ ] Gnosis 8 The Talon binds the spirit of a thicket or a bramble into a large, dead branch. The branch is then placed over a path or somewhere that the undergrowth is light. When the fetish is activated, brambles, thorn bushes, poison ivy, and all manner of unpleasant or poisonous plants spring up from the ground and block the area. The more activation successes the player rolls, the larger an area is blocked. The blockage remains until torn down (or purpose or by weather) or until the Red Talon willingly de-activates the fetish; the Talon can remove the branch from the path without disrupting the growth. Alpha Klaive[ ] Gnosis 8 This is a variation on the klaive unique to the Silver Fangs. This weapon acknowledges that sometimes good leadership is a better quality in an alpha than pure destructive power. Instead of binding a war-spirit into the blade, the blade forger uses a falcon-spirit. Instead of doing aggravated damage against all opponents, the weapon now aids the alpha in making crucial tactical and battlefield decisions, boosting his effective Leadership by two dots. The difficulty to attack with an alpha klaive is 7, as there is no war-spirit to aid the wielder, but it still inflicts Strength +2 lethal damage. Werewolves cannot soak damage from the weapon and still treat the klaive's wounds as aggravated, because it is made of silver. The bearer loses one point from his Gnosis rating while carrying the weapon. Spirit Dagger[ ] Gnosis 7 This blade has several important properties. The bite of this obsidian blade is grievously painful to spirits (including all manner of Banes), adding two levels (not dice) of damage to any successful attack. But more impressively, the dagger can pierce the Gauntlet. By spending a Willpower point and making a successful Gnosis roll (difficulty is the Gauntlet rating), the wielder may make a single attack into the Penumbra. Note that unless the Garou has some way of seeing exactly where the spirit is, she is subject to the penalties for fighting blind. There are two downsides to this weapon. While the blade is practically unbreakable when striking spirits (including materialized spirits but not fomori), it reacts like colcanic glass when striking anything physical (i.e., it's liable to shatter when striking bone, wood, metal or almost anything harder than flesh). Also spirits can sense the blade's presence and react unfavorably to the bearer. Heron spirits are typically used to make a spirit dagger. Qallunaat, Tearer of the Veil[ ] Gnosis 7, Unique Legends tell that when the spear Qallunaat is thrown, its bone tip whistles through the air like Wendigo's screaming wind, doing sonic damage to all creatures that are neither Garou nor Kinfolk. The sound of Qallunaat flying through the air incites Delerium as it rips through the Veil on its way to its target, sending most humans to their knees with paralyzing fear. There is considerable debate as to whether all Kinfolk, who carry Garou blood are immune to the sound of Qallunaat, if it only spares those of Wendigo blood. Some stories even say that non-Kin humans who are members of Native American tribes are also safe from the effects of its scream, despite their usual vulnerability to the Delerium. Since Qallunaat has not been found within the living memory of any Wendigo, the debate will likely last for quite a long time. The Ulu of Arnaguatsaaq Chill-That-Waits[ ] Gnosis 6, Unique Lost even beyond the remembrance of most ancestor spirits, this curved bone knife was a gift to Chill-That-Waits from Luna herself, aiding Chill-That-Waits in defeating the great monster Luumajuuq. The haft, tang and edge of the Ulu were one, created from a single piece of silvery bone, shapped to instantly and intimately fit the grip of its wielder, ever sharp and completely unbreakable. Bound within the crescent-shaped blade, it is told, was the righteous spirit of a Lune, dedicated to shedding her purifying light into any corrupted darkness. Some believe that the fetish knife contained, instead an immortalized war-spirit that fought for Luna with extraordinary skill and fury. Or, perhaps, the two spirits were entwined together. Whatever power was confined within this woman's knife, though, allowed Arnaguatsaaq to fight the Ice-Breaker and the monstrous bird Aipaloovik with the strength of ten. The Song of Chill-That-Waits says that when Luna is ready to aid Wendigo in a battle of vital importance to Garou, she will cause the Ulu to rise from its hiding place, and allow it to fall into the hands of her chosen, the mightiest female warrior worthy to follow in Chill-That-Waits' paw prints. Rumor has it that the Ulu has recently been found; which most elders consider to be a bad omen for the immediate future. Cedar Bowl[ ] Gnosis 6 A carefully fashioned bowl of cedar wood, as perfectly round as the full moon, cradles the spirit of several bound water elementals. The rim of the bowl is bound with a flat ribbon of copper, and the sigil that binds the spirits is etched into the bottom of the bowl and also filled with poured veins of copper. The bowl itself is utterly indestructible and fireproof. When the bowl is activated, by filling it with water and dragging a wet fingernail or claw around the rim in a complete circle, it lets out a penetrating ringing chime that is carried by the wind. The bound water elementals then rise and cause all sources of fire within hearing of the ringing or sight of the bowl to be completely extinguished. The holder of the bowl may spend additional points of Gnosis to encourage a wind-spirit to carry the sound further and further, making it possible to put out fires from considerable distances away. Each point of Gnosis expended doubles the original distance that the sound carries; for example, the chime may ordinarily be heard 150 feet away on a still day, but can be heard 600 feet away with the spending of 2 more points of Gnosis Wendigo Shield[ ] Gnosis Variable Heating a prepared piece of buffalo hide until it hardens to the thickness of an inch creates this signature fetish of a Wendigo warrior. The hide is then stretched over a frame of whalebone or antler for sturdiness, and decorated as the Wendigo sees fit. Usually buffalo shields are adorned with an assortment of furs, scalps, and other relics of the warrior's vanquished foes. A shield may have several war-spirits bound to it, and some shields can even be home to the ancestor-spirits of the honorably defeated, who have chosen to aid the Garou who conquered them nobly in combat. Any Wendigo Shield adds 1 point to its wielder's Intimidation skill, and increases her soak by an amount equal to half its Gnosis. War-spirits are attracted to fearsomely decorated Wendigo Shields, with successes on a Dexterity + Crafts roll increasing the likelihood of attracting a powerful war spirit into the shield. However, an excessively decorated shield is cumbersome to wield, and costs the Garou who carries it a point of Dexterity. Treasured shields are often used by Theurges in divination rituals before battle. These kinds of fetish shields can also be set up outside a dwelling, opposite the door, in order to guard the warrior within from spirit attacks to his blind side. There are even stories of shields that, when unveiled, drive off the enemy without even a single blow being struck. Gnostic Bag[ ] Gnosis 9 This small pouch, usually decorated with ornamentation and Garou pictograms, can store Gnosis. To activate the pouch, the Garou must reach in and literally remove and eat the Gnosis. The number of successes on the activation roll determines the number of Gnosis points gained. The bag holds its Gnosis score in points; when exhausted, the bag must be recharged by spending points directly into the bag. To create this fetish, an Engling must be bound into the bag. Rager[ ] Gnosis 8 This shard of bone is made from the remains of an Ahroun who fell in combat against the Wyrm. When activated, the fury of the warrior fills the user with a point of Rage per activation success (maximum of 10 per story). To create a Rager, one of the following spirit types must be bound into the bone: Anger, War, Wolverine or Boar. Level Five[ ] Grand Klaive[ ] Gnosis 7 These mighty blades are the klaives of the most legendary heroes. Carrying one of these immense silver swords costs a Garou two points from his effective Gnosis rating. A war-spirit is usually bound into the grand klaive, allowing it to inflict aggravated damage to non-Garou. Grand klaives are very rare and usually tied to specific Garou lineages, especially among the Silver Fangs, Fianna, and Shadow Lords. Besides the usual war-spirit, a second spirit \u2014 such as a fire-spirit that might add extra soak dice against fire when the klaive is activated or an ancestor-spirit that might provide extra dots in an Ability such as Occult or Survival \u2014 is usually also bound into the grand klaive. The secondary spirit rarely minds sharing the fetish with another, as grand klaives represent the pinnacle of honor in the eyes of Gaia's warriors. The difficulty to attack with a grand klaive is 7, and it inflicts Strength +3 damage. Werewolves cannot soak this damage except in their breed form. Werewolves, especially young ones, who possess a grand klaive attract the attention of the mighty. Elders often question the audacity of a youth who dares to carry such a sacred weapon, while his peers may covet the power and attention. Ironhammer[ ] Gnosis 5 Lesser version of the mighty Jarlhammers, these one-handed hammers are potent war fetishes in their own right. They are forged of silver-laced iron, with spirits of war bound within. An Ironhammer inflicts Strength +2 damage, and the damage is aggravated; Garou can soak these wounds, as the silver content is overwhelmed by the iron. A Get may hurt an Ironhammer up to 10 yards for every point of Strength; the hammer returns to its rightful owner after each toss. Jarlhammer[ ] Gnosis 6 These mighty two-handed hammers are the pinnacle of Get craftsmanship. Like the lesser Ironhammers, they are forged from silver-laced iron and cooled in the blood of freshly slain enemies; however, the Get bind spirits of war and silver alike within. Each hammer inflicts Strength +3 aggravated damage; the damage counts as silver damage, and is thus unsoakable to Garou. Only a werewolf can throw such a weapon accurately, and only to a distance of 5 yards for every dot of Strength. Whenever a blow from a Jarlhammer slays its target, the hammer resounds with a powerful thunderclap, announcing to friend and foe alike that another enemy of the Get of Fenris has fallen. There are seven of these hammers; some are wielded by powerful Jarls, while at least one has been lost. Each one has its own name and secondary power: - Forge-Crusher blazes with fire when activated, and inflicts an additional health level of fire damage with each blow. - Grinding-Tooth can smash any stone into powder, obliterating a cubic foot of rock or concrete with every strike. - Spear-Chaser flies three times as far as its siblings when thrown, and the thrower never suffers any penalties for range. - Troll-Eater pulverizes bone and smashes armor; opponents lose one die from all soak pools to resist its damage. - Bright-Arm shines with the light of sun and moon alike; opponents who rely on sight to target opponents lose two dice from their dice pools when attacking its wielder. - Hag-Talon is fortified against the magic of enemies, granting its wielder three additional dice to any Willpower roll made to resist mindmanipulating powers. - Pain-Eagle leaves wounds that throb with agony; those wounded by the hammer suffer double the usual dice pool penalties for their wounds. Runestones[ ] Gnosis 7 Soothsay Runes, Tarot cards, crystal balls, divination bones \u2014 this fetish has almost as many names as forms. When activated, the runes show the caster a vision of what is to come. The number of successes on the roll should determine the degree of truth in the vision, and the Storyteller, based on how complex the reading is, should set the difficulty. Visions touching on the Apocalypse tend to be extremely complex and difficult to interpret. To create any divinatory fetish one must bind a spirit of time, dream, enigmas, or wisdom into the tools. genEsys[ ] Gnosis 8 Myth, madman's creation, keystone to the secrets of the universe, forgotten language of a long-lost doomsday machine, mathematical fetters imprisoning an ancient Incarna of the Weaver - there are more urban legends surrounding this fragment of code than there are copies allegedly distributed throughout the 'Web. The closest anyone has come to successful decomposition and/or documentation of this system is the recovery of an incomplete text file referring to \"Ephemera Generation Software.\" As its name might suggest, the genEsys algorithm creates, or at least coaxes chaos into a higher state of order - catalyst to an interpretive process which bridges the gap between potentiality and actuality, spinning structure from shapelessness. Through this miraculous translation from conception to manifestation, dreams (and nightmares) realy can come true, or so it seems. Using an iterative series of user-input definitions, specifications, refinements, compilers, optimizers, linkages and block-transfer computations, any conceivable object(s) (and, to a lesser degree, lifeform(s)) can be patterened, detailed, and implemented. System: Although comprehensive systems are hard to set down when it comes to playing God, the generative process is arduous, exhausing, and intensive (mentally, physically and spiritually). Assume a minimum of one full day spent coding for every square foot or so of material to be created - double or triple this estimate if the creation in question is complex, intricate, and/or composed of many smaller parts, multiply by at least ten if even a small degree of intelligence/sentience is desired. (Perfect biological creations are impossible, owing to human (and Garou) science's still-limited understanding of organic mechanisms; with sufficient time and preparation, however, moderately life-like and/or intelligent simulacrums may be fashioned). An Intelligence + Computer roll (difficulty 8) must be made for each and every day spent in the construction phase; failure on this roll indicates lack of progress for that day. (Treat botches as serious setbacks that increase development times, or, worse, fundamental flaws overlooked in the design which will come back to haunt the programmer later...) Following its dynamic design, the construct is generated and grown; assign this a cost in Gnosis equal to the number of days spent coding (This fuel can be contributed all at once or (more likely) over the course of several days/weeks - in general, most will find the process difficult and draining.) Once compiled and furnished with spiritual fuel, achetypes fashioned in this manner take on permanent, tangible existence in the Umbra only, and disintegrate/lose resolution the moment they attempt to cross (or are forcibly brought across the Gauntlet. How this limitation of the genEsys algorithm would respond if/when introduced to the Shinzui projector and others of its ilk is anyone's guess... The Dionysian Strain[ ] Gnosis 8 Throughout its checkered history, mankind has been plagued by so-called miracles of science - last-ditch measures of desperation, often born of depravity or warfare. More often than not, these become abominations the human race would take back if it could - abominations for which no individual or group will take credit. Sadly, the world of the Weaver is no different. This mutagen has been used twice in human history to preserve the Veil when it was close to collapse - in both cases the circumstances and conspirators responsible for such decisions have been kept as closely guarded secrets from the Garou Nation. Its origins stem from an unsanctioned Progenitor research lab, some shadowy Eastern syndicate, or a clandestine series of experiments conducted by extremist Glass Walker biotechnologists using Red Talon pituitary glands, depending upon who you System: Whether or introduced intravenously, defixio luporum hominumque causes severe, wracking pains in a human recipient, whose immune system recieves one chance (standard soak roll, difficulty 9) to fend off an hours long transformation into a monstrous man-wolf form. Three successes are required to shrug off subversion; failure turns the subject into a gargantuan wolf (just shy of pony-sized), while partial success results in an incomplete metamorphosis (something along the lines of a monstrous lumpy, hairy Glabro lookalike). In all cases, transformations are irreversible, and rob their victims of both speech and reason (or so those in the know fervently hope - the alternative would be unthinkable). Such subjects are invariably hunted down and subdued (or killed) for study and vivisection - it is their complete lack of supernatural forensic evidence (blood/tissue samples, DNA, et al. ) which has, to date, helped preserve the great game played by mankind and the Changing Breeds. Bronze Labrys[ ] Gnosis 7 The oldest weapon of the Black Furies stem from the tribe's Golden Age, in Athens during the days after the Trojan War. During that time, they acted as arbiters of justice within the city to the dismay of lawbreakers throughout Athens. A few fetishes remain with the tribe from those ancient days; accordingly, they are fashioned out of bronze, as were most weapons and armor of the day. The Bronze Labrys is intended as a sample fetish of this sort; Storytellers and players are encouraged to create their own ancient fetish weapon to fit their chronicle's backstory. The Bronze Labrys does Strength +5 dice of aggravated damage; additionally, it moves under the influence of the Gorgons' spirit invested into it, and gives its wielder a free Block maneuver each turn of combat, at no multi-action penalty. The Bronze Labrys can store up to five points of Gnosis, which its wielder may tap as a free action, to use as she sees fit; she can also invest her own Gnosis into the Bronze Labrys to replenish energy that she has spent. Lastly, once per day the Fury wielding the Bronze Labrys may use it to cut through up to a three-foot depth of almost any inanimate substance; doing so, she can dig a human-sized hole Umbral CB[ ] Gnosis 8 Ripped from the dashboard of an eighteen wheeler, this citizen band radio has been invested with powerful mojo. It won't pick up transmissions in the physical world, but it can tune in to any one Garou in the Umbra. Typically, powerful Theurges in the Deserters camp craft Umbral CB's. Before the werewolf begins his Umbral quest, he places his hand on the radio's casing. The owner of the fetish can then find the right channel to keep in touch with the Umbral traveler. No matter where the traveler ventures in the Punumbra, the owner of the fetish can hear his voice and broadcast transmissions. If the traveler crosses into the Near Umbra, another activation roll at a +1 difficulty is required to maintain contact. If the Umbra wanderer ventures into the Deep Umbra, an additional activation roll is required at a +3 difficulty. Using the Umbral CB requires a few sacred phrases to converse with the distant Garou. The owner of the fetish initiates conversation by grabbing the microphone and formally hailing his erstwhile companion beyond the velvet shadow of the Gauntlet. (\"Breaker, breaker, Piss-in-the-Wind, come back?\") A brief exchange of cosmological lore establishes where the traveler is in the spirit realm. (\"That's a big 10-4. What's your 10-20, over?\") Separated by the cruel division of flesh and spirit, the Garou then take turns speaking, poetically acknowledging the distance between them by ending each exchange with sacred phrases (namely, the words \"come back\" and \"over\"). Either Garou may sever this mystic link with the proper incantation (\"10-4, over and out\") Boar's Tusk[ ] Gnosis 7 This fearsome fetish, a large tusk from a boar suspended by a leather thong, marks the wearer as someone you don't want to mess with. When activated the fetish adds one health level per success and one Stamina per successes for one scene. Threefold Axe[ ] Gnosis 7 The culmination of Fianna smithing skill is the threefold axe, a weapon crafted to be useful against fae, shapeshifters and undead. Each one is forged of a blend of cold iron, silver and gold - a technique that would be all but impossible without the rites of forging and spiritual assistance. The resulting alloy is spiritually hardened to a steel-like quality. Because the alloy dilutes the purity of each metal (thus, the damage it inflicts on werewolves is not truly \"silver damage,\" and therefore not unsoakable). However, the spirits within charge the power of each metal, giving the axe the power of each metal's mystical affinity. Threefold axes do Strength +3 aggravated damage, and are difficulty 7 to wield. They do two extra dice of damage against vampires, fae or shapeshifters with a vulnerability to silver or gold; this damage can be soaked if the target is capable of soaking aggravated damage. To properly finish a three-fold axe, the smith must bind an earth-spirit, a solar spirit of some kind, and a lunar spirit into the axe. Convincing the three spirits to coexist is almost as difficult a process as forging the axe in the first place, but the triple mystical power of sun, moon and earth is hard to deny. Watcher's Shield[ ] Gnosis 8 This small wooden token, shaped like a shield, is worn around the neck. When activated, the shield adds five dice to the wearer's soak roll, but only against cowardly attacks. Only one opponent per round will have a direct shot at the wearer; for all other attacks from behind or from cover, the wearer recieves the extra five soak dice. To create such a fetish, the crafter must bind a turtle-spirit or spirit of vigilance within. Assassin's Klaive[ ] Gnosis 5 The weapon of choice for Theurges who need to see a rival eliminated, these bone-colored blades are also used to quickly and quietly destroy those that prove to be difficult to attack directly. Sleek and deadly, assassin's klaives are easily hidden underneath clothing, and are quite innocuous if observers don't know what to look for. The snake-spirit within the klaive allows the possessor to expend a point of Gnosis to activate one of the following abilities: surround himself with an aura of absolute silence for a scene, mask his scent for one hour, or eradicate his footprints while he walks for one day. The blade is not actually silver, but inflicts the wielder's Strength in aggravated damage, and the difficulty to soak wounds from an assasin's klaive is raised by 1 Owl Talon D'siah[ ] Gnosis 7 Only two of these ancient flint blades are known to survive in the modern day. The curved blade is carved to resemble not the crescent moon, but the clutching talons of an owl. The Owl Talon has all the qualities of the standard fetish d'siah above. In addition a second spirit, that of a desert owl, is bound to the blade; when the knife is activated to drain Gnosis after a successful strike, the owl-spirit snatches the energy up and channels it to the wielder, who adds it to his temporary Gnosis. The wielder's Gnosis may never exceed his permanent rating in this manner. Also, the wielder may activate the fetish after a successful blow against an Egyptian vampire. If successful, a blood point is drained from the vampire and converted into Gnosis for the d'siah's wielder. This Gnosis is dark and unnatural, and may push the werewolf into frenzy -- as long as the character has the tainted Gnosis in his pool, his difficulties to frenzy are reduced by one per point of tainted Gnosis. Once the affected points of Gnosis are spent, the Garou's frenzy difficulties return to normal. Bane Seal[ ] Gnosis 7 The prisons that trap the Great Banes cannot contain their evil forever. The bindings weaken and fade unless a Bane Tender is standing guard. But there have always been too few Tenders, and even they must sleep or periodically find refuge from the Tainted energies lest they weaken and fall. The Bane Seal acts as the lock on the spiritual prison, giving the guardians an extra measure of security. This fetish varies in appearance. Some are simply slabs of rock carved with runes; others take the form of elaborate sand paintings. A powerful Weaver spirit is bound to the fetish. Although it rarely enters willingly, it can't go against its nature and is soon hard at work keeping the energy strands of the Bane prison ordered and strong. The Seal is set in an important location close to the Bane (usually on the ground above its resting place or at the mouth of the cave which traps it). Upon activation, the Seal must be fed Gnosis to sustain the spirit's strength -- depending on the Bane's strength, it may require 5 Gnosis per month or even more (alternately, the Storyteller may rule that the Seal requires one Gnosis for every success scored in the initial binding). If not fed the proper amount, the strands of the prison begin to weaken until they fail. Some Garou bind spirits that can siphon energy directly from a caern (or a network of caerns), further safeguarding the Bane prison. Small wonder, then that the disruption caused by invasion or destruction of caerns resulted in the release of many great evils. Nogunqaaq and Itungunqaaq, the Spear and Mask of Destiny[ ] Gnosis 8, Unique Nogunqaaq's vicious point can thrust with deadly might through all Tellurian planes -- the Underworld, Earth, the Gauntlet, the Penumbra, the Near Realms, the Membrane, and the Deep Umbra -- wounding whatever lies in its path, in any place, reality or manifestation. Nogunqaaq's tip is made of moon-drenched silver, its shaft a rippling pole of ice with lightning trapped within its depths. Seeing through the slitted wooden eyes of Itungunqaaq lets you glimpse your foe's thoughts and movement as they ripple through the planes. Nearly always, an enemy's thoughts change before his flesh shifts, or calls upon spirits who can be seen, warning the wearer of Itungunqaaq of attack, defense or gambit before matter is even set into motion. Most well-informed Theurges and ritemasters know that Nogunqaaq was last seen in 1896, in the hands of a wily Yukon Ragabash by the name of Hammerpants. In the midst of the Klondike Gold Rush, Hammerpants won the spear in a poker game from a Wyrmcomer in Dawson City, by the name of Joppe Humber. Hammerpants' local Wendigo friends in Moosehide were, naturally, dubious that the spear was actually Nogunqaaq. Hammerpants proceeded to demonstrate its use to them with frightening effect, stabbing through reality and releasing several troublesome Jagglings and a particularly nasty Vortex from the Deep Umbra. After the fires were put out, he claimed that he had no idea how Humber had come by the precious Spear of Destiny, but that he fully intended to take it with him to Nunavut and give it to the ritemasters there, since he could trust no one else but himself. Unfortunately, the day after he left, an avalanche buried Chilkoot Pass in a hundred feet of snow, apparently swallowing up Hammerpants and Nogunqaaq with him. Since Itungunqaaq the Mask only comes when Nogunqaaq calls it, both fetishes are effectively lost for the time being. Ghost Dance Shirt[ ] Gnosis 7 These fabled war-shirts are sewn of flexible hide or seal intestine, and decorated, armor-like, with intricate breastplates. These breastplates are threaded together with sinew, constructed with elaborate rows of long tubular hairpipe, beads made of shells, bone, reeds, and sometimes glass or other metals. The tailor performs the Rite of the Fetish during the shirt's construction. Howling and singing prayers to the spirit of the wearer's choice, exhorting it with every dip of the needle, the tailor convinces the spirit to enter into the growing network of threads and beads. The Ghost Dance Shirt generally has a symbol of the spirit incorporated into its pattern as an additional enticement, and it is only declared finished when the spirit has been successfully bound. Once the wearer activates the shirt, the spirit protects her completely from any non-magical, ranged projectile damage, such as crossbow bolts, arrows, bullets, shrapnel, thrown rocks, or sling pellets. Regular edged attacks or bashing attacks in close combat still hurt the Wendigo normally. If a Ghost Dance Shirt is worn outside of combat, it gradually saps the wearer's Wits, at a cost of one point per day; the bound spirit becomes so eager to deflect damage that it tries to put itself into harm's way to make the situation possible. A character that reaches Wits 0 in this fashion frenzies at the slightest inconvenience or provocation. Heart of the Spirit[ ] Gnosis 6 This fetish resembles a miniature heart carved from rose quartz. It allows the user to store up to ten points of Gnosis, Willpower or Rage (choose one at a time) within it. The activation roll's successes determine the number of points that can be stored that scene. A successful activation roll is also needed to draw points out of the heart; the number of successes determines the number of points available to be withdrawn. To create this fetish, an Engling must be bound into the crystal. Hearthstone[ ] Gnosis 8 This oblong flagstone is generally kept in a Garou's home. When placed within a domicile, it becomes a link to Gaia and permeates the home with tranquillity and calm. When the Hearthstone is activated, the area around it (up to the size of a small house) becomes linked to Gaia in the manner of a caem. Garou become able to regain Gnosis through meditation within a domicile that contains an activated Hearthstone. The stone works only within a permanent residence. To create this fetish, one of the following spirit types must be bound into the stone: Calm, Ancestor or Peace. The Lune Shield[ ] Gnosis 9 The first item created by a promising fetish smith the Cliath Ahroun Hoirebard Steel-Litany Mac Aghain born to woman of Stag this shield was born of purified metal in an awakened Smelter. The metal born pure was forged pure in an Awakened Forge on an Awakened anvil Forged by the Rare Goibhnius' Hammer. The smith worked without a break until the shield was born from this beginning. The Adren Theurge Dagwood Walks-under-Turn-Styles, That-Coffee-Better-Be-Ready, Bladed-Face-Plant Adren of the Nation born to Woman to the Bone Gnawers took this beginning and worked for days convincing a Lune Spirit to inhabit the shield. Tirelessly the Theurge worked and was successful in his endeavor creating a shield that Gives Armor Equal to its owners Rank. This Shield is currently in the hands of The Athro Galliard Oscar Claws-The-Story , Path-Drinker, Even-Hand, Mercy's-Axe O`Neil born Stag Alpha of The Caern Croi Orga. Level Six[ ] Exhibit 338: The ] Gnosis 10 This one-of-a-kind object was affectionately named by a creative (if creepy) security guard who watched one too many West Carpenter flicks. It sits crated in a classified storage facility amongside hundreds of other curiosities of its ilk. Removed from its crate and other packaging, the object appears to be a slender three-foot cylinder of some iridscent blue-green fluid, thicker than most liquids, yet not quite solid. An obvious testament to technology advanced beyond anything the world has yet seen, it remains warm to the touch (37 Celcius) in all environments and is fashioned from some glare-free glass -- although, if it is glass, the instrument has not yet been forged that could even scratch its surface. More stories than storytellers surround this unearthly container and its strange payload, which resists all attempts at identification. Some believe it to be ichor from an ancient Weaver Incarna, heartblood that retains power over its mistress still. Others maintain it is the stuff of Before -- the primordial essence of a dawn time older than Names, identities, or even consciousness. And more than a few, pointing to same-time similarities between this item's discovery and the recent struggles at the Sept of Bygone Visions, whisper that it serves as prison to no less an entity than Thrassus Thrice-Damned, Smallest-Talon of the Wyrm itself. But how could such a corrupt power (or any Wyrm talisman) enshroud itself so completely in heretofore-unseen Weaver technology? And what hellish alliance could explain such a merging between Weaver and Wyrm? Chalice of Renewal[ ] Gnosis 8 This mystic chalice of gold appeared to Garret Faithful and his warriors as they sat at meat before going to the Amazon. It is known to have appeared from time to time throughout the Children's legends. Some say it held Mother Gaia's tears when she wept for her children, the five slain Garou pups who founded the tribe. Others claim that it was the cup sought by Arthur's knights. Its powers are certain. Only one such chalice has ever existed. One new moon in three, the chalice fills with seawater. Anyone who drinks this primeval salt-water falls into a deep sleep wherein they have a vision of Gaia. This vision is different each time but always contains the sorrow of a mother for her fallen children and the renewal of life with the morning. These are the memories of Gaia, but also relate to the dreamer's own life and work. On waking, the dreamer is cured of all diseases or wounds. Fogg's 9mm[ ] Gnosis 8 More than any other weapon, Glass Walkers love to turn pistols into fetishes. Numerous variations on the fetish pistol exist, however one of the most famous of these is Fogg's 9mm. According to legend, Chicago detective Jackson Fogg made it his life's work to bring Gianluigi Lucci down, and finally found him on an abandoned waterfront with his pack around him. Lucci taunted him for nearly an hour before Fogg suddenly shot, and Lucci gasped as the sheer accuracy and force of the blow from the handgun caught him completely off guard, and he nearly died. His pack tore the policeman apart, but his bravery had attracted a Wind Spirit that bound itself into the gun, explaining the bullet's prfound speed and accuracy. Lucci used the gun himself until the day he died. Any bullet fired from this unique fetish does aggravated damage, and all Firearms rolls made using the gun are at -3 difficulty. Furthermore, for every turn spent immobile, without changing the gun's aim, it adds two additional dice of damage. A maximum of twenty dice of damage can be added in this way. Thunder's Bracers[ ] Gnosis 9 This mighty fetish is exactly what its name implies it to be -- a pair of armor plates for the forearm which are tied to the storm, infused with a portion of Grandfather Thunder himself. There is to date, only one set in existence, and the Margrave Konietzko wears them. The bracers appear to be made of deeply stained metal, set with the teeth of an unknown creature. They are a symbol of his power, but not the source of it -- the Margrave was crushing his opponents long before he created these bracers, and he will continue to do so should they leave his possession. Thunder's Bracers have many powers. They increase the wielder's Strength by 4 points, and the wielder may make claw attacks normally. If the wielder uses the bracers to block an attack made with a metal weapon, or with an unarmed attack, the assailant automatically suffers two levels of lethal damage due to the electrical discharge generated by the armor. Additionally, the bracers provide up to four Gnosis points to the wielder per day, which may be used as he sees fit. Finaly, the wearer of the bracers may spend three Gnosis points to call forth a bolt of lightning to smite his foes. If there happen to be storm clouds overhead, the lightning comes from them; otherwise, it comes from the bracers themselves. In either case, the lightning deals five levels of aggravated damage to a single target, which may not be soaked by any means. Ulunsuti[ ] Gnosis 9 The Ulunsuti is a rare, if not unique, object, for in order to get it, one of Great Uktena's most powerful children must die. On the forehead of an Uktena is a clear crystal, large as a dinner plate and hard as diamond, with a blood-red streak running through the center from the top to the bottom. The powers ascribed to this stone are many, but chief among them is the ability to prophesy, seeing images of the future in the crystal \"as a tree is reflected in the quiet stream\". In addition, the owner is said to be able to see anywhere he can name, and even cast his eye into the distant past. He is also gifted with luck in his endeavors, so long as the stone's hunger is sated. But as with all such power, there is a price to wield it. The ulunsuti must be given blood every seven days (half a pint - the blood of a small animal will do), which soaks into the stone and makes the streak shimmer. Twice a year, it must drink the blood of a large animal, such as a deer. Some wise men warn that the stone must never be given more than a little human or Garou blood, for it will learn to crave only that and accept no other kind. Since no one currently admits to having an ulunsuti, there is no way to confirm this. If the stone isn't fed properly, it flies through the air at night and drinks its fill from the owner or his people. In addition, it is rumored to allow only its owner to touch it, attacking anyone else who ventures within reach. When not in use it must be wrapped in a whole deerskin placed in an earthen pot and hidden in a dark place (a cave is preferable). If the owner intends to store it away for a long time, he must tell the stone he won't need it for a long time, and (hopefully) it will go to sleep; it must be fed before he again tries to use it, or it will drain his blood. When the owner dies, the stone must be placed upon his chest; otherwise the Ulunsuri hunts for him every night (presumably feeding as it does so) for seven years before going into Slumber. In either case, after seven years it may be awakened. If the Garou feeds it blood and successfully attunes it, he becomes the new owner (if the Garou fails, the awakened crystal goes back to sleep beside his bloodless corpse). Soothsay Runes[ ] Gnosis 7 This divinatory fetish can take many forms, from rare stones marked with Garou glyphs to carefully painted fortunetelling cards or even handmade playing cards. When activated, the runes show a vision or hint of the future. The clarity of the vision is determined by the successes on the roll. The difficulty is determined by the Storyteller, as is any information. Any readings about the Apocalypse inevitably come up blank, and should the Garou botch the roll for such a request, the cards are destroyed. To create such a divinatory fetish, one of the following spirit types must be bound into the tools: Time, Dream, Enigmas or Wisdom. Fetish Drums[ ] The Garou often add deep, stirring rhythms and music to their rituals. The instruments they most often use are drums, particularly in Uktena and Wendigo rites. More than just instruments, some of these drums are powerful fetishes in their own right. Most fetish drums require a Dexterity + Performance roll to activate, the difficulty being the drum's Gnosis. Such activation is never a combat action. The drummer must spend time letting the rhythm gain its own life and tempo, letting it feel its own pace. If the drummer takes particularly long, the Storyteller may want to substitute Stamina for Dexterity. Bata'a (Level One)[ ] Gnosis 5 This cone-shaped drum, possessing both large and small heads, adds one die to any Gifts or rites dealing with the Umbra. If the drummer knows the secret language of the Lucumi (the people who invented the drum type), he may send messages by drumming, even into the Umbra. To create this fetish, one of the following spirit types must be bound into the drum: Wisdom, Enigmas or Music. Spirit Drum (Level Two)[ ] Gnosis 5 This drum helps the drummer to call Gafflings, Jagglings and other minor spirits. The player rolls Dexterity + Performance versus th# drum's Gnosis; the number of successes adds to the Dice Pool to call the spirit in a Rite of Summoning. Any Wisdom-spirit can empower this drum. Taltos Drum (Level Three)[ ] Gnosis 6 This drum is an aid to healing rituals. The number of successes the drummer gains while drumming equals the number of Health Levels healed in the listeners. This method of healing can be used only once per week (or per month at the Storyteller's discretion). To create a Taltos Drum, one of the following spirit types must beljound into the drum: Unicorn, Healing or Snake. Slit Gong (Level Four)[ ] Gnosis 7 This immense drum, carved from a single tree trunk, is used by Australasian and Pacific Northwest Garou. Slit Gongs' huge size makes them suitable for use in caerns only. During a rite, the drummer may add the successes he gains on this drum to the ritemaster's successes. To create a Slit Gong, one of the following spirit types must be bound into the drum: Tree, Enigmas or Wisdom Wyld Fetishes[ ] The Wyld can occasionally be generous. There are many and various gifts that it can bestow on its erstwhile allies, the Garou; gifts of varying potency and use in the war to preserve the Wyld itself. That being said, the Wyld is also extremely fickle about where it bestows its favor and in what fashion it does so. The following Wyld fetishes are \"true\" Wyld fetishes -- they are not reproducible by the Garou, and attempts to fabricate them always end in failure. Instead, they are simply found. Sometimes they appear, sometimes they are transmogrifications of perfectly mundane items, and sometimes an emissary of the Wyld delivers them by hand (or claw, or tentacle, or so forth). Some last for centuries and are handed down within a sept; others crumble to dust after a single use. The only guarantee is that there are no guarantees with gifts from the Wyld. Most Wyld fetishes are either animal-shaped or somehow related to animal or plant life. Often, they are effigies of some sort of living creature. Curiously enough, all Wyld fetishes are automatically attuned to the Garou who finds them, but can't be passed to another. It would seem that the Wyld likes to personalize its gifts. It may be more useful to think of Wyld fetishes as multiple use Talens than as fetishes proper. After all, the Garou does no binding of spirits and is simply an end-user in the process. A Garou attempting to recreate a Wyld fetish is most likely going to meet only with frusteration and a total lack of results. If he's realy unlucky, he'll attract unwanted attention with his efforts, and then things could get realy ugly. Having the Wyld peering over your shoulder while you're experimenting is never a good idea. Glass Mites (Level One)[ ] Gnosis 5 Glass mites aren't alive in any strict sense of the word. They simply mimic that state remarkably well. Glass beads no more than a half-inch in diameter, a handful of mites will sit comfortably in a leather pouch for days or even years until needed. However, once they are activated it is both time-consuming and difficult to recapture them. Once triggered, glass mites animate into a frenzy of sound and motion. Spread out on the ground and infused with Gnosis, they swirl into a hovering cloud of multifaceted annoyance. While they don't actually attack a particular target, they will torment a chosen victim through distraction, getting underfoot, high-pitched chittering and so forth. Systems: Any victim of an infestation of glass mites is at a +1 difficulty to perform any action, +2 for anything involving concentration. This lasts until the energy infusing the mites drains out or they get bored and wander off. Either is liable to take between one and eight turns. A victim of glass mites will appear to be flailing at nothing, jumping at shadows and generally acting very strangely. However, anyone seeking to take advantage of this by attacking the victim immediately scatters the glass mites, and releases the target from his torment Green Leaper (Level Two)[ ] Gnosis 4 A Green Leaper is nothing more than a roughly frog-shaped lump of moss. It's quite fragile, and must be kept moist lest it crumble to dust. However, when a Garou concentrates and turns the Leaper loose, it suddenly looks much more frog-like and indeed becomes animate, leaping from surface to surface in a random pattern. This includes living creatures, and more than one Pentex goon has been unnerved by the sight of verdant growth emerging from his gun hand as he watches. System: Where the Leaper lands, a patch of moss immediately starts growing. While this may not seem like much, a sudden lush outgrowth of moss can play havoc with electronics, computer equipment and so forth. The moss is easily removed, and the Leaper reverts to its original, inanimate state after six turns. However, it can jump up to a dozen times within the space of a single turn, leaving quite a mess behind it. On rare occasions (and with the expenditure of an extra point of Gnosis), the patch of moss the Leaper leaves behind starts to spread rapdily. This fact has produced a favored moneywrenching tactic: shoving overcharged Leapers under the door into server or control rooms and turning them loose. Within minutes, the entire room is liable to be covered in a thick growth of soft moss, which needless to say, doesn't do the equipment any good at all. Swarmbags (Level Two)[ ] Gnosis 4 Simple cloth pouches, tied and knotted with leather thongs - swarmbags don't look like much. True, they do have something of an unpleasant consistency to them, but until thrown they are inert lumps and nothing more. The shapeshifter lucky enough to be granted these talens usually finds between four and a dozen. Once they are tossed at an enemy, however, swarmbags become an entirely different proposition. On contact (a Dexterity + Athletics roll, difficulty 5 is required to score a direct hit), the bag bursts open as a swarm of crawling, biting creatures erupts and frantically scurries about whatever - or whomever - the bag has hit. System: Without a successful Willpower roll (difficulty 7), the target immediately ceases whatever he was doing and starts trying to sweep the bugs off of himself. Doing so requires 2 successful Dexterity rolls (difficulty 6), giving the werewolf who tossed the swarmbag in the first place at least one clear shot. Even those targets who make their Willpower rolls are at +1 difficulty for all actions until the bugs are either scraped off or fall off of their own accord. The contents of a swarmbag are a mixed lot: insects, arachnids, worms, and less identifiable creatures. None are venomous, but some bite (albeit for no damage). The creatures swarm for up to six turns after being hurled at a target, and they will not infest anyone or anything except their original victim. Only one Swarmbag can be thrown at a time, though enterprising Garou have attempted double-barreled action in the past. The Bent Vine (Level Three)[ ] Gnosis 5 The Bent Vine is nothing more than a withered and dried piece of kudzu with a glyph scratched painstakingly into it. No more than three inches long, it's utterly unremarkable to look at. However, when dropped on soil of any sort, the Bent Vine springs to life as a positive hydra of greenery. If it's brought in to contact with vines that already exist, it stirs them into a frenzy of explosive growth. The resultant wave of vines is aggressive, dangerous and inclined towards grabbing anything nearby for purposes of pulling bits of it in multiple directions. As a result, Bent Vines make excellent cover for a Garou looking to beat a hasty retreat in the face of aggressive pursuit. System: A Bent Vine has a Strength of 4 and a Dexterity of 5, and can make up to a dozen attacks per turn. The Vine itself must land on either soil or plant matter to be effective, but once it is activated, the monstrous growth is almost instantaneous. A contested Strength roll (difficulty 6) is needed to tear loose from a clinging vine, but as up to five vines can nab a Garou-sized target at once, it's entirely possible for someone to get overwhelmed, quickly. There are no degrees of aggressiveness for Bent Vines. Once they are called forth, they are mindlessly ferocious. Furthermore, they make no distinction between friend and foe, and a Garou who stops to watch his handiwork runs the risk of getting a little too close to the action. Bent Vines last for five turns, though the investment of a point of Rage can double the duration. Cold Ichor (Level Three)[ ] Gnosis 6 Cold Ichor occasionally manifests itself in the dew off certain species of tree found near Wyld places. The fluid is an iridescent, almost glowing green that easily catches the eye, and it collects in just a few leaves at a time. Garou who recognize the liquid for what it is harvest it very carefully, or else give the tree producing it a wide berth. Cold Ichor can be stored very easily in glass or ceramic, and it is neither caustic nor acidic. Until used, it will sit quiescently in whatever container holds it, perhaps glowing faintly in the proper light. Garou who harvest Cold Ichor, however, are very careful with it, and will wash themselves thoroughly after even coming near the stuff. It's simply too dangerous to treat with anything other than extreme caution. System: What Cold Ichor does is dramatically accelerate cell growth in anything it touches, once activated. Both plant and animal matter are affected, succumbing to rampant, uncontrolled growth that can have absolutely dire consequences. External contact tends to produce huge (usually benign) tumors; internal use can produce something best described as an extremely accelerated cancer. The actual effects are variable (and their game effects are left to Storyteller discretion), but drinking something that's been laced with Cold Ichor is almost always a very bad idea. Not that the substance also produces massive sudden growth in plant life as well, which is useful for rapidly camourflaging a cache with overgrowth and suchlike. For some reason. Cold Ichor is much less destructive to plant tissue than to animal, though caution in using it is still an excellent idea. The effect of Cold Ichor is almost instantaneous, though it only lasts a minute or so. However, in most cases a minute is more than enough. Ded Bugz (Level Three)[ ] Gnosis 6 While it's not necessarily the most attentive member of the Triat, the Wyld does keep up with the times. It also, if this fetish is any indication, possesses a mediocre-to-poor sense of humor. Ded Bugz are almost exactly what their name would suggest, insect cadavers tucked into grass-and-straw versions of themselves. (Purists suggest that this is related to the custom of the wicker man; cynics note that it's difficult to carry around dead bugs without squashing them beyond recognition. The Wyld itself is mum on the matter). No more than an inch or two long, these fragile contraptions nonetheless can be quite effective. System: A Ded Bug randomizes numbers and fries systems. It's excellent for wiping disks and otherwise making computer equipment emphatically unserviceable. The Bug does not emit an electromagnetic pulse. Rather, it tells all of the local ones and zeroes that they have the opportunity to mix themselves up again, as it were, effectively fragging any sort of storage medium. All that's required for this effect is for the Garou possessing the Ded Bug is to place it on top of the system, disc or other item she wants randomized, and then to concentrate on the target item. The one caveat is that the Ded Bug must be in perfect condition for it to function, which means that the Garou toting this tiem around must be extremely cautious. Ded Bugz do not, however, work on living tissue, though trying to fry someone's mind with one is a good way to get various Wyld-spirits very irritated. Wyldflute (Level Three)[ ] Gnosis 6 A wyldflute is a variation on the panpipes, and looks about as threatening. A non-Garou playing one is liable to get a series of toots and whistles, nothing more, a Garou who's in the know, however, can get something far more impressive. System: the Wyldflut, when played for effect, instantly instills a single emotion at fever pitch in all that hear it. The unfortunate thing is that the emotion is random from listener to listener. One may feel joy, another terror, a third, inchoate rage. The effect is, as one would expect of a gift from the Wyld, totally without rhyme or reason, and the end result is often pure chaos. A successful Willpower roll (difficulty 7) enables the listener to resist the effects of the Wyldflute, though another roll must be made for every minute that the flute's music can be heard. Note that the Wyldflute must actually be played for its powers to have any effect. Random huffing and puffing doesn't get the job done. Birnam Sands (Level 4)[ ] Gnosis 7 Birnam sands doesn't look like anything spectacular. Indeed, they resemble nothing so much as a handful of yellowish dust, marred with occasional sparkles that the untrained eye might take for flakes of mica or quartz. Close examination, however, reveals that the shimmers actually move throughout the sand at a pace just short of a blur. What the Birnam sands do is quite remarkable. A pinch of the dust, properly activated and sprinkled in a circle around the base of a tree, is enough to convince the tree to pick up its roots (temporarily) and go walking in a random direction. Needless to say, a hundred-year old oak tree gallivanting about using its roots for legs can do quite a bit of damage, and when a particularly crafty werewolf gets a whole grove up and stomping around at once, the results are usually quite impressive. The effect of the sands lasts up to a half an hour, and while the trees seem to be utterly chaotic in their motion, they always somehow manage to avoid colliding with one another or with the Garou who turned them loose. Said Garou's companions, however, may not be quite so lucky. When the effect of the sands wears off, the trees reroot themselves comfortably and stably in their current positions. Left behind are gaping holes in the earth and torn-up sod where they once stood, but anyone looking at the trees' new positions would have sworn that they'd been there for years. System: Generally a small handful of the sands can handle between one and five trees, a medium one between five and 10, and a full pouch up to 20 trees. There are songs of legendary Garou spreading enough of this material around to wake entire forests, but the amount of sand needed to accomplish that feat is simply mind-boggling. The Garou who wakens the trees will not be harmed by them. However, she also has no control over them; the best she can do is stay out of their way. Awakened trees have no apparent sight or hearing, but they can respond to a threat. Anyone attempting to cut down or otherwise harm a rampaging tree is liable to be trampled by several tons of very angry wood. However, even just a blundering tree is liable to do a lot of damage to buildings, cars and whatever poor souls get in its way. Like all other Wyld fetishes, Birnam sands are found, not made. Occasionally upwellings can be discovered near Wyld places, but such fountains are always brief and always vanished upon a return visit. Essentially, the Garou who is lucky enough to find such a deposit (assuming he knows what he's found) can take away as much as he can carry at the time, but that's all. Upwellings of Birnam Sands are only found by solitary Garou, for some reason. Attempts by a werewolf to inform others of his find inevitably produce nothing more than barren patches of sand and faint echoes of mocking laughter. Primordial Slime (Level Four)[ ] Gnosis 5 Primordial Slime is possibly the Wyld's ugliest creation, and there's plenty of competition for that title. A dull greenish-black in color, it has the consistency of vomit and a stench to match. Only glazed ceramic jars will hold the stuff safely, though Glass Walkers swear by Pyrex lab glassware. In any case, it's vicious stuff, but thankfully not at all common. Where the stuff comes from is unknown, and very few Garou are at all eager to find out. Even the name is something of a mystery. According to lore, a young Glass Walker Theurge saw it for the first time and commented derisively that it looked like the primordial slime back before life had dragged itself into existence. The story was passed around and the name stuck, but the laughter at the tale has always been just a little bit uneasy. System: Primordial Slime's one great attribute is that of transmogrification. Brushed onto any non living surface (only a brush made from Garou hair will do; anything else is changed instantly), it changes that surface into another substance. While the Slime is incapable of transforming inorganic matter into living tissue, it can turn a brass padlock into charlk, a length of rope into steel cable, or a stone wall into cheese. However, it can also turn that stone wall into strontium-90 or glass - the effect is totally and utterly random. The only other limitation on the use of Primordial Slime is that something that has been changed once cannot ever be affected by the liquid again. This makes its use a gamble, and never something to rely on. Stone Kettle (Level Four)[ ] Gnosis Variable Contrary to its name, the Stone Kettle is not, in fact, made of stone. Usually it's blackened iron, sometimes wood, but always deceptively roughthewn. There's only the vaguest glimmer of anything supernatural about the kettle (which, in truth, looks exactly like a cheap piece of cookware), and only those looking hard will notice that the battered pot is more than it seems. For awhile a Stone Kettle can be used as simply that, it also can perform a few other, more interesting functions. With just some boiled water and a stone, a Garou who knows what he's doing can use the Kettle to boil up vapors, stenches, clouds and suchlike to suit his purposes. If he doesn't know what he's doing, however, he just might brew something with unexpected - and dangerous - consequences. System: Unless the werewolf working with Stone Kettle invokes the Wyld beforehand, it functions as just an ordinary pot. Anyone attempting to activate it without doing so is liable to get nothing more than several helpings of granite-flavored broth, and that's if he's lucky. If, however, the werewolf knows his business and does things properly, he can cook up practically any sort of cloud within reason. The type of fog to be summoned must be specified beforehand - if it is not, the exact sort of foul smoke that comes out of the kettle is left to Storyteller discretion. However, it is unlikely to be helpful to the Garou wielding the ladle, or even safe. A Wits + Rituals roll (difficulty 6) is necessary to summon forth the kettle's contents. The more successes, the greater the volume of cloud summoned and the longer it lasts |Gnosis||Rolls for Summonings from the Kettle| |4||Fog, Cold wind, pleasant aroma| |6||Stench-laden fogs, Icy winds, Smoke| |7||Clouds thick enough to make those trapped in them choke| |9||Clouds thick enough to make those trapped in them ill| Note: The Kettle costs an additional point of Gnosis to activate for each level of fog created. The uses of the Kettle are limited only by the Garou's imagination, and the fact that under no circumstances will the Kettle brew up something that is an actual poison. The first time a Garou attempts to do so, the Kettle will shatter. Venomous Swarmbags (Level Four)[ ] Gnosis 6 These are identical to regular Swarmbags, except that the creatures release are all venmous to a greater or lesser degree. While it is unlikely that any given bite will be deadly, there is always that chance.... Willowhip (Level Five)[ ] Gnosis 5 Appearing as nothing more than a green, leafy coil of willow branch a Willowhip is surprisingly deadly for something so innocuous-looking. Extending up to 18 feet in length, the Willowhip is used exactly like a bullwhip, though to much greater effect. System: When a Willowhip wraps the arm or leg of an opponent, it does not release. Rather, it grows - encasing and mummifying the victim in green willow wood in just three turns. When the process is completed, the Willowhip breaks off at its normal length. A Strength roll (difficulty 8) is required to break free, but that just undoes on turn's worth of growth. A victim who is completely encapsulated needs three successful rolls to break free. While the mummification process is happening, the Garou who possesses the Willowhip cannot take any other action involving the whip. If she does so, the process aborts instantly. Once a victim is mummified, he is completely immobilized. On a botched Strength check, he begins to suffocate, and unless freed within five turns, he will asphyxiate. Celestial Fetishes & Talens[ ] The fetishes described here can only be obtained through interaction with the planetary Incarnae or one of their lesser spirits or spirit servants. Characters cannot make these fetishes themselves. Most of them are rare, appearing only in the hands of those individuals who have done something to deserve recieving a gift from one of the planetary Incarnae. Storytellers should feel free to design other fetishes that come from the Aetherial Realm. Level Three[ ] Hunter's Talons[ ] Gnosis 6 Made from chunks of an asteroid from Rorg's domain, these metal talons can be laid atop a Garou's own claws, like some sort of clawed gauntlet. Their damage is that of a standard claw attack, but by activating the fetish, the Garou can double his damage dice pool against Wyrm creatures. Needless to say, a Garou using these talons usually place the fetish on her dominant hand (these fetishes do not come in pairs). The damage is, of course aggravated. A spirit of the hunt is bound into each fetish. Ruatma's Cup[ ] Gnosis 5 This pewter drinking cup, when activated, inspires anyong who drinks from it to regard the cup's owner as a confidant and close friend. The drinker receives a subconscious Willpower roll, difficulty 9, to resist the effects, but will not realize that he is potentially being manipulated. The effect is so subtle that the victim doesn't realize what has happened, even after the effect has worn off. Maidenstone[ ] Gnosis 6 A female Garou who possesses one of these small, flat stones can control her reproductive cycles to the extend that she can decide whether or not to become pregnant. A male Garou who has a Maidenstone can likewise decide whether or not to father a child. Unfortunately, the odds of siring or birthing Garou children aren't affected. The Maidenstone eases childbirth for the possessor or for an individual designated by the possessor (who must lend the fetish to her for the duration of labor). This fetish glows with a steady warmth whenever the possessor comes into contact with an individual whose destiny is linked to the Maidenstone's holder. Skhta's Pathstone[ ] Gnosis 6 This small flat stone resembles a pearl and has a wolf's claw imprinted on one side. Most Pathstones remains in the caern where they are used to form one end of a Moon Bridge. Sokhta's Pathstones, however, can be carried about by a Garou and can, therefore, allow the formation of a Moon Bridge from wherever the carrier happens to be to another spot that has a Pathstone attuned to it. Level Four[ ] Songstone of Eshtarra[ ] Gnosis 7 This small, rounded stone contains flakes of mica that reflect the moonlight. When activated, the Songstone grants a vision to the one who uses it. The vision, though not exact and frequently couched in symbols, gives a hint about the immediate future (within 24 hours). For example, the Garou invoking the power of the Songstone may see a misshapen black bird swoop down upon a sleeping wolf. This might suggest the possibility of a surprise attack upon a nearby caern while most of its members are sleeping. A spirit of time or dreams is generally bound into one of these fetishes Star Compass[ ] Gnosis 7 This device appears to be an ordinary compass. When carried into the Umbra and activated, however, it functions as a directional device that unerringly leads the possessor to whatever realm she desires. The Garou need only concentrate on her intended destination while holding the compass. This fetish comes from Meros' wandering realm and contains one of that Incarna's lesser spirits. Level Five[ ] Ice Klaive[ ] Gnosis 7 Although this weapon is no bigger than a standard klaive, this silver ritual dagger causes aggravated damage equivalent to a Grand Klaive (Strength + 4). The difficulty to hit with an Ice Klaive is 6. In addition, when activated, the extreme cold of the Ice Klaive causes an additional Health Level of non-aggravated damage equivalent to frostbite. This fetish weapon comes from Nerigal's cold domain and contains one of his warrior spirits. Zarok's Spirit Crown[ ] Gnosis 7 This simple metal band when activated and worn increases the wearer's Charisma with regard to Umbral spirits by two extra dice. Spirits respond favorably to the Garou and assist her in any way possible, including fighting for her or seeking out information from other spirits. If the Crown is worn for more than one scene, the Garou suffers a blinding headache that continues to escalate until she removes the Crown for at least 48 hours. A minor spirit of Zarok is bound into this fetish. Level Six[ ] Moonsilver Klaive[ ] Gnosis 7 This ritual dagger, unlike other Klaives, bears a permanent coating of Moonsilver. Thus, a Garou who carries this dagger loses no Gnosis from the underlying silver of the klaive. Instead, the Garou functions as if his Gnosis were one point higher due to the Moonsilver. The dagger houses a spirit of war or protection and does double damage dice against silver vulnerable opponents. The difficulty to attaack with a Moonsilver Klaive is 6. Garou and other creatures intolerant of silver may not soak the damage from this weapon. This fetish comes from Sokhta's Realm and can only be obtained from her or one of her spirits, although it is possible for a Garou to obtain Moonsilver and dip her own klaive in the substance. |Moonsilver| |This silvery substance, available only from Sokhta or some other Incarna of Luna, originates in the Aetherial Realm that corresponds to the moon. Objects dipped in melted Moonsilver do twice the number of aggravated wounds to Garou or other silver-vulnerable creatures that an object of plain silver does (although a mere coating will soon flake away like a coat of paint). In addition, Moonsilver objects increase their possessor's Gnosis by one -- although if the wielder carelessly comes into contact with the naked Moonsilver of his own fetish, he isn't shielded from the damage. Garou may obtain Moonsilver from Sokhta through performing a quest for her, although they must sacrifice a point of permanent Gnosis to her as payment.| Talens[ ] These talens provide examples of the kinds of items found in the Aetherial homes of the Planetary Incarnae. Unlike other talens, these are not created by Garou, but carried back from Umbral quests. The Storyteller should feel free to create other similar items Bloody Bandages[ ] Gnosis 7 These are just like they sound, bloodied and dried bandages. Only Ahroun are able to make them. They require a leech spirit to be bound into them. The ahroun shifts to crinos and cuts himself to bleed into bandages wrapped around the arms, legs, and chest areas. The Ahroun must bleed themselves down to Incapacitated in order for the talen to be created and Leech to accept the sacrifice. Once the talen is activated, it can heal 4 levels of damage up to healthy at a rate of 1 level per round. This will not take the wearer above healthy. Blood Ice[ ] Gnosis 5 This reddish knife-like shard of ice remains solid and sharp as long as it remains sheathed. When drawn to use for a weapon, it causes aggravated damage -- but also begins to deteriorate. The first time it strikes an opponent, the Blood Ice does Strength +3 damage. The next successful attack does Strength +2; the third and final attack does Strength +1. After that the Blood Ice \"melts\" and becomes useless. This talen originates in Nerigal's realm. Estarra's Flowers[ ] Gnosis 7 These tiny blossoms, when cast upon the ground, summon a member of Estarra's pack to help fight for the summoner or defend a certain place. The spirit wolves enjoy the advantage of being able to fight both on the material plane and in the Umbra. The materialized spirit fights until its body is \"killed\" (in the physical world) or else its Power is drained (in the Umbra). Each flower may be used only once. |Spirit Wolves (Estarra's Pack)| | | Attributes: Strength 2, Dexterity 2, Stamina 3, Perception 2 Abilities: Alertness 2, Athletics 2, Brawl 3, Dodge 1, Primal-Urge 2, Stealth 2, Survival 4 Physical attacks: Bite, Overbear, Body Slam, Leaping Rake. When attacking in their normal spirit form, the Spirit wolves have the following attributes and abilities Rage 9, Willpower 10, Gnosis 7, Power 40 Charms: Airt Sense, Reform, Blast Flame (3 dice of aggravated damage) Meros' Winged Scarab[ ] Gnosis 6 This tiny jewel is shaped like an Egyptian scarab. The Garou can activate the talen so that it becomes a tiny insect which can either scout ahead for the Garou, or else serve as a distraction for its master's enemies or pursuers. In either case, the Scarab vanishes after it has completed its task. This talen comes from Meros' realm. Mercurial Powder[ ] Gnosis 4 This silvery powder when placed on the tip of the tongue, temporarily increases a character's Wits by 2 dice (even if this exceeds five dice). This increases the user's reaction time and any other Wits-related activity for one scene. This ashen dust comes from the realm of Mitanu and is granted only to those who've successfully quested there. Rings of Lu-Bat[ ] Gnosis 5 This dust, when blown or sprinkled on its target forms a ring that tightens and holds the victim motionless. Anyone caught in the ring must answer a single question truthfully, Once the victim has given a true answer, the ring dissipates. The ring has a Strength of 8 for purposes of breaking free from its grasp. The dust originates in Lu-Bat's realm Shantar's Waters of Thought[ ] Gnosis 5 This clear liquid when imbibed, increases the drinker's Intelligence by 2 dice for a single scene. This enables the person who partakes of the Waters to come up with some important insight or solve some puzzle that might otherwise elude her. Shantar's watery realm supplies this talen. Sunfire[ ] Gnosis 6 Carried by necessity within a darkened sphere, this blazing molten liquid can burn out sickness or heal injury. When applied to a wound or swallowed, Sunfire causes intense agony from its great heat (often resulting in temporary unconsciousness). Even so, the liquid cures up to three health levels of aggravated damage, and also purges diseases, poisons or Wyrm-taint from the bodies of its victims. This liquid comes from Katanka-Sonnak's domain; it's rumored that immersion in Sunfire might even cure Fomori of their state, if they could be taken to the realm for a cure. Tambiya's Seeds[ ] Gnosis 7 These small seeds, when tossed upon a piece of damaged ground, begin a healing process that repairs damage to the earth over an extended period of time. Each seed affects a square mile of ground and serves to purify the land from Wyrm taint, toxic waste or the effects of strip-mining or some other form of non-natural corruption. The seeds come from Tambiyah's Aetherial home. Vulcan's Embers[ ] Gnosis 5 This glowing ember may be used to forge or destroy a single weapon or can be hurled at an opponent. Weapons created using one of Vulcan's Embers add an additional die to damage pools, while weapons thrown in a fire containing one of these talens are reduced in one turn to useless slag. If used as a weapon, an Ember inflicts three Health Levels of napalm-like aggravated damage before dying. These Embers originate in Hakahe's fiery realm Tattoo Fetishes[ ] Tattoos are common among the Fianna; some have spirits bound into them. These take the form of Celtic designs or Garou glyphs, and must be of quality craftsmanship -- a spirit isn't likely to willingly enter a heart with \"Mom\" written across it, particularly if such a mark was purchased in a parlor. System-wise, tattoo fetishes are treated like ordinary fetishes with one exception: should the player ever botch her activation roll, the spirit is instantly freed; the tattoo flares, leaving an outline on the skin which gradually fades away. Scar Fetishes[ ] Scars are permanent, cannot be stolen, and easily portable, making them perfect for Red Talons. However, they are also very difficult to create so even among the wolf tribe, they aren't terribly common. A scar fetish is created when a spirit is bound into a ritual scar on a werewolf's body. The scar in question is sometimes inflicted deliberately in the shape of an appropriate glyph, but more often a werewolf who suffers a battle scar will receive a scar fetish as recognition for his sacrifice. A Garou mystic can bind a spirit into the hardened flesh of a scar itself, instead of into a prepared object. The binding of a spirit within the scar of a Garou takes additional effort, and as such is even more rare than the creation of a fetish object. The Rite of the Fetish must be completed regardless, with the scarred flesh pruified in the same manner; cleansing it with earth, water, flame or wind. The spirit can be bound more easily however, if the scar is created through an action the spirit understands and would be honored by. A spirit of death, war, pain, or of a warlike ancestor can be coerced into a battle scar; the scars from an attacking bird's talons may serve to flatter and convince the binding of a raven- or falcon-spirit. Just as with the Rite of Binding, spirits can be bound temporarily to create a talen instead of a fetish, and if the Rite fails, the spirit may be angered and cause damage not only to the ritemaster, but to the scarred flesh as well. The difficulty to create a fetish scar is increased by 2, to a maximum of 10, because a Garou's spirit is so strong that few spirits can easily coexist within his flesh. Some examples of scar fetishes include: Level One[ ] Cunning Fetish[ ] Gnosis 5 Powered by the spirit of a raccoon or equally clever little beast, this fetish allows the player to add activation successes to her character's Enigmas for the scene. Level Two[ ] Swift Fetish[ ] Gnosis 6 A swift-moving bird spirit or hare-spirit powers this fetish. For every two activation successes, the character's running speed doubles for one scene (so four successes would quadruple the character's speed for a scene). Level Three[ ] Might Fetish[ ] Gnosis 7 The spirit of a strong animal, such as a moose or a bear, is bound into the scar. The player may activate the fetish and add the activation successes to the character's Athletics for one scene Talens[ ] Talens are simpler versions of fetishes, created with the Rite of Binding, which are easier to create but more limited in effect. Like fetishes, talens are objects that contain spirits. They require a Gnosis roll to activate, but not to attune. However, talens can be used only once. After fulfilling the terms of its binding pact, the talen's spirit departs and the item loses its potency. Where forceful binding into a fetish is a slap in the face of the entire spirit world, werewolves consider aggressive binding into a talen acceptable, as the binding is only temporary. A talen's Gnosis rating is equal to the bound spirit's Gnosis. One extra talen of the same type can be made for each additional success on the Rite of Binding roll. For example, three successes create three Bane arrows. Gafflings are commonly bound to make talens; more powerful spirits make the creation of multiple talens easier, adding two or three extra talens to the total number generated. Talens last until used. The Final Draught[ ] This powerful potion is made by ritemasters who are also herbalists. Portia Tucker, Child of Gaia and survivor of the Civil War, was one of the last who knew who to make it. Its ingredients include wolfsbane and heart's ease as well as alcohol. When consumed the drinker can Change only once more before it takes effect, and thereafter cannot shapeshift ever again. She remains Garou in all ways, including rites and Gifts, but is trapped in one form till death. Uses for this drug vary. Septs have used it as a punishment for breakers of the Litany, but some older Children of Gaia have used it as a form of retirement (or suicide) after a lifetime of service. As the drinker cannot shapeshift for any reason (even if Gnosis drops to zero), some take it, enter Crinos and go to death in battle. Metis have even used it to ensure that they will not break the Veil by sleeping or dying to reveal their Crinos form. Bane Arrows[ ] Gnosis 4 These obsidian-headed arrows unerringly seek Banes, whether or not they are visible. They hit Banes automatically and inflict three dice of aggravated damage. The bite of a Bane arrow is so painful that no Bane can resist howling in agony. Wyrm-spirits can sometimes sense the presence of these talens, and may not wait for the archer to fire before acting. To create a Bane arrow, one must bind a spirit of war, air, or pain into the arrow. Chiropteran Spies[ ] Gnosis 6 These Shadow Lord talens look like wooden bat figurines, which come to life when activated. The Chiropteran Spies can serve as scouts, spies or diversions for up to 12 hours. When their tasks are completed, they turn to sawdust. Similar talens exist among other tribes: The Silent Striders have clay scarabs, the Children of Gaia use porcelain doves, and the Glass Walkers have small metal insects. To create a chiropteran spy, a bat-spirit must be bound to the carving. Death Dust[ ] Gnosis 6 When broken open, activated and sprinkled over the dead body of a recently (within a day) deceased creature, this small jar of dust allows the Garou to communicate with the corpse's spirit. To create death dust, one must bind a spirit of death, communication or divination into the jar. Gaia's Breath[ ] Gnosis 5 When this small, dried gourd is crushed and the dust sprinkled over an open wound, the talen heals up to four health levels of damage (even aggravated damage). To create Gaia's breath, one must bind a spirit of healing into a glyph-decorated gourd. Moon Glow[ ] Gnosis 8 This talen is a single moonbeam caught within a small crystal. Upon embarking on a journey into the Umbra, the wielder may activate this blessing from Luna. As long as it is carried continually, the journey should be a safe one. The crystal shatters once the Garou reaches his destination. This talen keeps away only incidental danger \u2014 it has no power to ward off enemies actively seeking the Garou, ambushes, or the repercussions of foolhardy actions such as insulting powerful spirits in their homes. Only a Lune can empower a moon glow talen. Moon Sign[ ] Gnosis 5 This small wax seal bears the sign of the full moon. When activated and thrown down before any werewolf, the werewolf's player must succeed on a Willpower roll (difficulty 7), or the character changes immediately into Lupus form. This talen works on Black Spiral Dancers and other Fera as well, making them shift to their animal form. To create a moon sign, one must bind a Lune, Wyldspirit, or wolf-spirit into the seal. Nightshade[ ] Gnosis 5 This talen is distilled from the very essence of night. When quaffed, one fluid ounce of this liquid turns the imbiber's body into shadow, rendering her virtually invisible in darkness. Only a watcher searching actively for the user can make a roll to spot her. This effect lasts only an hour. To create a nightshade, a spirit of night or darkness must be bound into a vial. Wind Snorkel[ ] Gnosis 3 If a Garou needs to swim underwater, burrow through the earth, or venture anywhere that she ordinarily cannot breathe, she can use this peculiar talen. Fitting the end of the tube into her mouth or muzzle, the werewolf can suck enough air through it to keep herself alive and moving onward on her journey, for as long as necessary. The tube need not protrude into air to function. The spirit departs when the Garou removes the tube from her mouth. To create a wind snorkel, an air elemental must be bound into a flexible, hollow reed or bone antler. Wyrm Scale[ ] Gnosis 8 This sigil possesses some protection against the power of the Wyrm. Servants of the Wyrm revert to their true forms if the sigil activates in their presence. Some believe that this action alerts the Wyrm to the existence of the sigil, but in any event, the sigil combusts in a greenish fire immediately after use, and is incinerated completely. To create a Wyrm scale, a Wyrm-spirit must be bound into the sigil. Tathlum[ ] Level 2, Gnosis 5 A tathlum is a sling-stone made from a specially prepared mixture of sand, lime, herbs and the brain of an enemy, into which a vengeance-spirit is bound. Ordinarily, a sling does Str+2 bashing damage. A tathlum generally does lethal damage. If the brain ball was created with a specific individual in mind, it does aggravated damage to that individual. The brain of an especially powerful foe (an elder Black Spiral Dancer or ancient vampire, for example) increases the damage by an additional +1 Mist o'the Glen[ ] Gnosis 7 A deep brown brew, this, with a white effervescence swirling along its surface like lake mist. It doesn't flow down |A Drink between Friends| | | Unlike fetishes and many talens, Gnosis is not required to use the magical brews listed here. Anyone can imbibe these draughts and feel their effects. For normal humans, however, the rolls are made at +1 difficulty. The effects last only for one scene. Afterward, a Stamina roll (difficulty equal to the Gnosis of the drink) must be made; a simple failure indicates a slight hangover and a somewhat muddled mind (the drinker is a little hazy on the details of the last few hours), while a botch indicates a full-blown headsplitter with no real recollection of \"what the hell I did last night.\" Not that a human, or even a Kinfolk, is likely to get a taste; this stuff is much too rare and potent to waste on the likes of them. Note that changelings do not suffer the added difficulty or need to make a Stamina roll to avoid the side effects; in fact, imbibing may strengthen their fae natures (gain a point of Glamour at Storyteller's option). They must roll Willpower to benefit from the drinks, however. And while the Gift: Resist Toxin will work against these rare drinks (usually at a +1 penalty for the more potent mixtures), no self-respecting Fianna would waste one of these wondrous brews that way, unless in sudden, dire need of sobriety the throat so much as swirl, but when it hits bottom it spreads a comfortable numbness through the body. The drinker's mood becomes amiable and reflective. Tense meetings between rivals, when suitably lubricated with this elixir, settle down to jokes, laughter, and wistful reminiscences. The drinker must make a Willpower roll against the drink's Gnosis rating. Success raises the difficulty to frenzy by two, and puts the imbiber in a more philosophical frame of mind. Those failing the roll lose a temporary Rage point, while botching removes all but one of their temprary Rage points - making the drinker perhaps even more mellow and philosophical than is good for him. This is one of the more common of the potable talens, and can be found at most Fianna caerns. Regal Mead[ ] Gnosis 7 Royal Mead, or Blue Gold, gets its common name from three facts: when held up to the light the golden liquid has a bluish hue; drinking it inexplicably turns the tongue blue for several hours; and a pint of the stuff makes the imbiber's eyes shimmer with a faint bluish glow. Its more formal name comes from the fact that most of the meager world's supply of the stuff can be found in the palace at Tara, for Royal Mead is considered by some opinionated Fianna to be the finest-tasting elixir in existence (though as rare as it is, few get the opportunity to taste-test. Imbibers who make a Willpower check against the drink's Gnosis can see clearly in dim light (and in total darkness as if it were dusk) for a scene, but most consider that to be a mere side effect of the heavenly elixir. Royal Mead is made from the honey of the Umbral flower Royalblood. |The Secrets of Magic Meads| | | Not just anyone can make these powerful drinks; the secrets are jealously guarded by a small cadre of master brewers, and the materials needed are even harder to find than the brewers. Such meads can't be made from just any honey; it must be honey derived from magical flowers. Battledew is a brilliant crimson flower, while Royalblood is deepest cobalt. Both of these flowers spread in low, thick mats across the western meadows of the Umbral Realm known as Arcadia Gateway, and are said to be found in isolated spots of the Fianna Homeland Realm as well. Recently, rumors have begun to circulate among the mead-makers that a young Theurge manage to successfully transport and plant the flowers at the heart of her sept's caern, and already others are on a similar quest, though to date none have been successful. Finding the flower is one thing; collecting the honey is something else. The bees that feed from these faerie flowers are changed by the potent nectar in subtle and unpredictable ways, so extra caution is in order. Since it takes several gallons of honey to make a gallon of mead, it's easy to see why such drinks are highly prized. Battlemead[ ] Gnosis 6 Battlemead is sweet as regular mead, but burns its way down the throat, exploding in the belly like some serious rotgut. Some Fianna like to take a few swigs before battle. If the imbiber succeeds in a Willpower roll against the mead's Gnosis, he gains a Rage point and can ignore the first wound level sustained in the upcoming combat. Failing the roll results in all Rage roll difficulties being reduced by one for the rest of the scene. A botch results in immediate frenzy. Battlemead is made from honey derived from Battledew, a rare flower found in certain Umbral realms. Bottomless Magazines[ ] Gnosis 3 Crafted from a nondescript matte-black metallic alloy, these war talens are made from standard high-capacity autopistol magazines, and must be tailored to specific makes and models of firearms. Identical in every way to their mundane counterparts save for the lack of load indicators, they never run out of ammunition for the duration of the firefight in which they were loaded. A pack of militant Monkeywrenchers operating out of Hong Kong's Mother of Peach Trees Caern refer to these showy ostentatious items as \"John Woo Specials.\" System: Truly rediculous feats of sustained fire are possible using these items, whose preternatural effects last for one scene. At the end of the scene in which it was first used, the talen runs dry, becoming an ordinary magazine of manufacture and capacity appropriate to its associated firearm (and without load indicators, not a very useful magazine at that). Easy Money[ ] Gnosis 4 The Weaver's crusades against change do not always manifest themselves in predictable or traditional fashions. An old financier's in-joke claims that money can be neither created nor destroyed, simply forced back and forth through the system in different forms - and nowhere is this more true than in the case of these quixotic talismans. Though the overwhelming majority of these Talens take the shape of hard currency, a few representative specimens have arisen bearing the stamp of newer technologies (traveler's checks, credit cards, secure e-cash). System: Regardless of when, where, or how this money is spent, every penny will somehow end up back where it started - circulating through local/remote banks, merchants, miscounted change, invalid transactions, fortuitously dropped bills, even subtle computer errors, until the exact sum returns to its spender's pockets, distinguishing marks, serial numbers and all. The cash always finds its way home, unless physically destroyed, in which case an equivalent number of differently-denominated bills and/or lines of credit are returned. Needless to say, since the Easy Money is a talen rather than a fetish, it's good for only one refunded spending spree - after that, it's simply money. Of course, a few cagey Theurges have prepared sums of cash that return to their enchanters' pockets after expenditure, regardless of who actually does the spending. Medusa[ ] Gnosis 8 Effervescent, silvery-white and strangely beautiful, this terrible calcifier, like its Gorgon namesake, is clearly not of this world - nor favorably inclined toward its inhabitants. The frightening concoction (which consists of some otherworldly enzyme seated in a methoxyacetylene suspension), though liquid, is lighter than air and extremely volatile; it must be stored in an airtight container or it will quickly evaporate. Its origins are unknown, although one popular theory claims it stems for the same unearthly substance of which the crystalline strands of the Pattern Web are comprised. As if this malign transmutant's very existence were not enough, the Wagnerians first credited with its discovery insist that it came not from the forges of any Theurge or Bane-brood, but from the lightless realm of the alien Vhujunka, whose deepest caverns are lined with the fossilized remains of unwary once-trespassers. Those who continue to quest for evidence of extra-Gaian planes and powers should be careful what they wish for... System: When exposed to flesh (living, dead, even cybered), the Medusan simplex springs into life, immobilizing then ossifying all that it metabolizes (skin, hair, nails, even inorganic materials in immediate (touching) proximity). To make contact with the target, the user must make a Dexterity-related roll appropriate to the method of dispersal (spray, bucket, makeshift grenade); difficulty is 6 for large areas of exposed skin (increase for fur, clothing and/or armor). The number of successes on this roll dictates duration and scope of the effect; one success indicates only temporary numbness or partial paralysis, while three or more successes might mean permanent loss of limb function or even complete petrifaction (Targets may elect to reduce the number of successes by expending Willpower, or heal petrified tissue over the course of several weeks using Gifts and/or regenerative powers, at the Storyteller's option.) Reunion[ ] Gnosis 6 A modernized and medically-accepted alternative to the Rite of the Kin-Fetch, this supernaturally-sensitive synthetic, preferred by tech-savvy Theurges and tribes, has proven instrumental in the identification and recovery of more Kinfolk and Lost Cubs than was ever previously thought possible. Reunion is introduced to the individual to be tested in one of three ways: subdermally (manifesting as a lump beneath the skin where injected, possibly discoloring), as a blood-borne indicator (mixed and observed in a test tube), and/or orally (in which case the recipient's urine and feces will carry results). System: When introduced to first-generation Kinfolk blood, or samples from one who has undergone/will undergo the First Change, the Reunion chemical changes color, texture, and even density, coalescing from a colorless, odorless solvent into a thick mercurial solid. The results are nearly impossible to misread (Intelligence + Medicine, difficulty 4) and unlikely to interfere with other tests (thus it is often 'piggybacked' onto blood-typing, HIV screenings, and other common labwork). Certain elements within the Garou Nation have smuggled both equipment and intravenous agents carrying the Reunion indicator into the medical circles of their surrounding communities; as they do with all things 'good' and/or 'pure', however, Pentex is known to have copied a strain of this vaccine for their own uses. The fight over Gaia's orphaned children continues... \"Slipstream\"[ ] Gnosis 5 This powerful and versatile substance first came not from the confines of a research laboratory, but aboriginal Australia; specifically, the shadowed gorges of Katajuta beneath the rocky Olgas. Scientifically-minded contingents within the Garou Nation view this unusual tincture as indicative of powerful tools and technologies of a bygone era - remnants of magic and mysteries harnessed by civilizations eons older than our own. The Slipstream ablative (called pitantjatjarakurunba (\"two worlds\") by those who guard its source) appears as a black, mildly reflective liquid not unlike crude petroleum in its natural state. It is typically stored and transported in clay pots or sacks of thick oilcloth. The viscous liquid activates when painted, poured, or otherwise transferred to an object so as to completely cover its surface (e.g., dipping). When distributed in such a manner and given a few hours' time in which to dry (during which it hardens into a gritty reflective coating not unlike mica rock), the coated object becomes capable of breaching the Gauntlet once (and only once); it may pass through any reflective surface of sufficient size; as would any Garou. Once through, the object in question cannot repeat the translation without a second coating; furthermore, transit is physically stressful and takes its toll on the material(s) transported. (Assume slow damage and degradation sufficient to destroy a man-sized object after half a dozen cross Gauntlet trips, more for larger objects, fewer for smaller ones). Care and precision are essential in preparation; Slipstreamed items with incomplete or blemished coats are fissured or reduced to component parts. The handful of incidents in which objects have emerged from the Slipstream translation apparently clawed or even burn-scarred fuel speculations of a between-place, neither physical nor Umbral, where transport occurs. It is for this reason that no organic test subjects have yet been exposed to the resin, and none who know of its nature would dare make the attempt Face Paint[ ] Gnosis 7 Face Paint can take on a number of appearances, from pancake makeup to rich ochre mud, usually depending on the cultural background of its maker. It's an extremely useful fetish, as it can temporarily obfuscate the wearer's appearance. When activated, the paint can simply make the user appear more or less beautiful (raising or lowering Appearance by two points), or give the wearer different facial features entirely. A person with dark skin and brown eyes might, for example, choose to have blue eyes and tan skin. The changes aren't present anywhere except in the face, but this is quite a useful item ot have when impersonating someone. The effects last for a scene. Cleansing Sand[ ] Gnosis 5 Used primarily by Talons who like to keep their enemies' skulls as trophies, the Clenasing Sand is created by binding ant-spirits into a small quantity of sand. The sand is then poured over a corpse. The ant-spirits strip the flesh clean, leaving dry bone behind. One \"dose\" of sand is enough to clean a human-sized skull. Purifying Root[ ] Gnosis 6 Even the Garou can be poisoned, and the Red Talons don't commonly know a Gift to counter such attacks. However, by binding a snake spirit to a root, a Red Talon can create a talen that, when chewed eliminates any natural poison in her body. It is also possible to chew the root a bit to activate it, and then give it to a Kin world that has been poisoned. Leech's Blood[ ] Gnosis 3 Many Garou wonder how the Shadow Lords have managed to persist in Eastern Europe despite the vampiric strongholds which seem to dominate the area. While much of the reason has to do with the guile and tenacity of the Lords themselves, talens like this one help ensure that the Lords' Kinfolk will survive even when surrounded by Leeches. They survive because the vampires learn not to feed upon them. The vampires never know, after all, one might have Leech's Blood on her person. This vial of syrupy liquid is useless to Garou, but quite valuable for their Kin. Any human may drink the blood with no ill effects. Any vampire drinking the human's blood, however, suffers one aggravated wound for every blood point drained from the human. The talen's potency takes approximately one minute to make itself manifest, so the vampire may drink quite a bit of blood before she realizes she's been poisoned. Making the talen requires a vial of normal human blood and a fire-spirit, but it is otherwise fairly simple. Its potency lasts for one night after being drunk. Wadjet's Fang[ ] Gnosis 6 The throwing stick was a hunting weapon favored by Egyptian nobility. Typically, the throwing stick was ornately carved, with one end weighted so that the stick would spin through the air to strike the target (typically a marsh-dwelling bird) with the heavy end. While the Silent striders' enemies are made of sterner stuff than spindly-legged birds, Cobra's spirit children are always willing to fight at the Strider's side -- cobra-spirits readily enter snake-carved throwing sticks. Hitting the target with a throwing stick requires a Dexterity + Athletics roll from the player against a difficulty of 7. A successful hit inflicts the character's Strength in dice of bashing damage. If the Wadjet's Fang is successfully activated, the venomous snake-spirit inflicts an additional three dice of aggravated damage. If the stick-smacked opponent doesn't intentionally break the throwing stick, and if the weapon inflicts less than five bashing damage (before the opponent's soak), the throwing stick is probably intact. While Cobra's brood are almost always willing to enter Wadjet's Fang, they are downright eager to inhabit a throwing stick that has damaged a powerful enemy and may compete for the honor. (At the Storyteller's option, each Gnosis spent in the Rite of Binding reduces the spirit's Gnosis rating by two rather than one for one. Pectoral of Terror[ ] Gnosis 8 These talens are extremely rare, and their owners rarely know the name or true nature of the beautiful necklace they have in their possession. Today these pectorals are usually created by the Silent Striders for use against the Black Sprial Dancers; others are created for use against Garou who have committed great wrongs against the tribe. The Pectoral of Terror appears to simply be a valuable and beautiful necklace, often conveniently \"dropped\" by a Strider (who must successfully activate the talen) feeling the scene. It is wrought of highly refined gold, and polished as perfect as a mirror. In the hands of a human or even a vampire it is simply what it appears to be, but in the hands of a Garou it is a time bomb. The spirit bound to the pectoral is a ghost, and it hides on the edge of the Dark Umbra -- only an exceptionally gifted Theurge could spot it lurking there, and few would think to try. If ever a Garou uses the polished surface of the pectoral as an aid to crossing the Gauntlet, the ghost within it snatches the werewolf away mid-crossing, pulling him instead into the Dark Umbra. The shades of the dead are drawn to these talens, especially those who hold a grievance against the proud, unsuspecting owner. They gather like vultures in the lands of the dead, waiting with the patience of the unliving for their chance at revenge. Falcon's Arrows[ ] Gnosis 6 Falcon's keen eyes allow him to see enemies at a distance. He understand that attacking at range is sometimes the wisest strategy and he encourages his children to learn this lesson. Sometimes, to help them, he allows them to take feathers from living falcons to craft Falcon's Arrows. These exquisitely wrought arrows have tips of silver and are fletched with falcon feathers. They fly as fast and true as Falcon himself swooping on his prey. All Archery rolls made with these arrows are at -1 difficulty. Despite their silver tips, any Silver Fang carrying them suffers no Gnosis penalty Poppy Leaf Bandage[ ] Gnosis 4 It is a leader's burden to go on fighting, however terrible his wounds. The poppy leaf bandage will stop an aggravated wound from worsening, and each bandage applied will also allow the werewolf to ignore on level of wound penalties. Once he removes the bandage, or a day passes, the wound commences bleeding once more, the werewolf starts to deteriorate, and the wound penalties return over the course of an hour. This talen is made from the leaf of a poppy with an ice spirit bound within. Moon Iglu[ ] Gnosis 8 This talen is a miniature ceramic vial with a Lune-spirit bound inside. When a traveling Wendigo needs to provide shelter for one who cannot endure the harsh elements of ice and snow and wind, or if she needs to rest while being pursued and cannot stay awake to guard herself, she may build an iglu and then open this vial within the iglu's crawlspace. The freed Lune fills the iglu with warmth and the peaceful glow of moonlight, visible from outside, while solidifying the thickness of the iglu's walls to the hardness of diamonds. The spirit then stands guard over whatever is sheltered inside the iglu, allowing no entry or exit without the consent of the Wendigo that released it. When the sun rises, the Lune returns to the Umbra and the iglu resumes its natural state. Snow Goggles[ ] Gnosis 6 Fashioned out of hide, bone or wood, these goggles are practical equipment for any Garou or Kinfolk traveling long distances through the snow. With slits carved or holes poked through the goggles, which are tied behind the head with a tong or sinew, the glare of sun over snow is diminished considerably, preventing snow-blindness and keeping one from becoming lost or dazed in a featureless landscape. Usually, a Wendigo asks the aid of a sharp-eyed animal spirit, a spirit of snow or ice, or a spirit with the Tracking Charm, and with its consent binds it into the goggles for the duration of her journey. A character wearing Snow Goggles cannot be blinded. Ice Arrowheads[ ] Gnosis 4 These arrowheads are made of translucent, needle-sharp chips of ice, frozen tightly to their shafts. Spirits of ice and water easily empower these fragil weapons, which melt away after embedding themselves in the body of their targets. To create these arrowheads, a copper mold is made and water poured into it, or chips are carefully carved and honed with other pieces of ice used as tools. Only once the arrowheads are completely sharpened should the spirits be bound to these talens. Ice Arrowheads do an additional Health level of damage against fire-spirits and those of Helios's brood. Wind Snorkel[ ] Gnosis 3 Created from a flexible, hollow reed or bone antler, this talen binds a willing air elemental spirit. If a Garou needs to swim underwater, burrow through the earth, or venture anywhere that she ordinarily cannot breathe, she can use this peculiar talen. Fitting the end of the tube into her mouth or muzzle, the Wendigo can suck enough air through it to keep herself alive and moving onward on her journey, for as long as necessary. Sun Arrow[ ] Gnosis 6 This arrow has sun designs along the shaft and sometimes the fletching as well. When loosed, this arrow flares with the light of the sun, blinding enemies and searing vampires within 20 feet of its path. Even at greater distances, Leeches fear its light, which is why some werewolves use the arrows as signal flares. After it strikes home, the arrow continues to burn for a number of rounds equal to the successes on the archer's Gnosis roll, doing two levels of aggravated damage (those who can soak fire damage do so at a difficulty of 9). After the final round, the arrow is consumed to ash. One of the brood of Helios must be bound into this talen. Vision Paint[ ] Gnosis 5 Priests in Mesoamerica used a black paste similar to this to bring visions and to inspire fear. Though fairly rare (the mixture of crushed and burned poisonous insects and plants is tricky to reproduce), jars of Vision Paint still find their way into Uktena septs throughout the world. When rubbed all over the body, this ointment boosts Stamina by one for every two successes on a Gnosis roll, up to double the normal Stamina. At the Storyteller's option, it may also increase the chances for a vision. The effects last for six hours, plus one hour per dot of Stamina in the improved total. One of the effects wear off, both Stamina and Strength are at -2 for the same number of hours. Because the talen requires total skin contact, it is only effective in Homid and Glabro forms. Hardware[ ] Semiorganic Storage Elements[ ] Device 1-5 The latest controversy fueling the long-standing conflagration between knowledge-based AI programmers and neroscientists, this marine biologist's fantasy was first conceived in the Silicon Valley (Palo Alto's up-and-coming Orgo Tech Laboratories). It has since been heralded as the fulfillment of technology's fabled \"fifth generation\" - a potential missing link between man and machine. This miracle of biotechnology's fabled \"fifth generation\" - a potential missing link between man and machine. This miracle of biotechnology sounds considerably more impressive than it seems at first glance; a standard SoSto (Semiorganic Storage element) appears to be nothing more than a glass-cased cube, almost twelve inches to a side, lined with honeycombs of an unremarkable off-white calcified substrate. (This incorporates certain oceanic invertebrate by-products and secretions not unlike those present in a coral reef.) When exposed to a weak electrical charge, each cell in the semicrystalline matrix can be induced to store \"zero\" (charged) or \"one\" (neutral) nearly indefinitely. Coupled with the correct hardware, the resin becomes functionally equivalent to modern transistor-driven memory - but entire orders of magnitude smaller and more energy-efficient, thanks to physical properties and complex geometry unique to the body-centered cubic lattice. Mass-production and parallelization techniques mated with these innovations may well make effectively limitless fast-access desktop storage a reality by the turn of the century. Further explorations into the next obvious application of this non-silicate-based technology -- simple-cellular organic storage elements, gated logic, even programmable bioprocessors -- are already underway. One research onsortium operating out of the University of California at Berkeley has reported limited success with fungus-based storage systems, while a classified project at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (Champaign, Illinois) conducts round-the-clock investigation into possible bacteriological data-carriers. (See the Mage supplement The Technomancer's Toybox for details on these and other extensions of biotechnology.) But these tides do not turn quietly. A handful of corporate-secure reports have begun to accumulate on various research staffers' desks concerning spontaneous state-change and unexpected adaptive-learning behaviors exhibited by a select few prototypes. Are the Californians on the verge of creating a monster? System: The Rank of a SoSto Device determines its storage capacity. First-generation (Rank 1) devices are roughly equivalent to 1990s high-end hard drives (6 to 9 gigabytes), while advanced models (Rank 2-5) can achieve nonvolatile capacities in the terabyte range or even higher. This technology carries no game mechanics per se, though Storytellers may wish to assign extra dice or lowered difficulties to certain Computer- and/or Research-related rolls. (Using even one SoSto for online storage, after all, it would theoretically be possible for an average Websurfer to download and compress ever bit of data she hears, reads, or sees in her entire lifetime.) [ ] Device 1 'Man's greatest works often spring from the humblest beginnings, or so an old adage reads. The first publicly-acknowledged noetic (from noetikos, Greek, \"of the intellect\") system was, of all things, a video game - a primitive 3D bowling-alley simulator in which the player, connected via cranial electrodes to an alpha-wave monitor, \"steered\" the ball right with structured thought and let it drift leftward by relaxing or daydreaming. Although the product and its parent company failed to popularize the niche market at which they were aiming, immediate extensions of the technology were obvious, and several governments quickly snapped up the project. The abortive F-24 fighter and Pawnee-class helicopter contracts, shelved following a handful of fatalities in testing, were widely believed to feature low-level cerebral interfaces in their test-bid models; indeed, at least one hush-hush military vehicle has used rudimentary noetic predecessors for years (see the Myrmidon). And the best is surely yet to come... System: Although noetic technology is still decades away from being practical or even reliable, its earliest incarnation - a convoluted and fragile series of electronic contacts, encephalogram translators, and sensitive switching elements - does permit elementary mind-driven motion. Initially, mobility is spastic, jerky, and exhausting; treat Dexterity as operator's Wits -3 (Although this penalty may be lessened with time and practice, mobility will never exceed the user's Wits -1.) Users may \"drive\" noetic machines for up to their Stamina rating in hours, after which they succumb to exhaustion and must rest (preferably eight hours' sleep). For reasons not yet fully understood, noetic systems are more responsive to left-handers. Miles Cassel (Vice President, Research and Development, Lockheed-Boeing Incorporated) attributes this phenomenon to differences in cerebral connectivity, going so far as to postulate the existence of a new subpopulation of \"noetic naturals\" (Homo sapiens mentis). His words, however, have fallen largely on deaf ears... Animus Energy Alternative Adapter[ ] Gnosis 6 On first glance these fist-sized devices, cabled, complex, and crafted from a blue-black nitinol-titanium alloy, resemble something out of a Gigeresque gallry. These squat, sinister units, each strangely reminiscent of a human heart, are docked in eight-foot columns of translucent plasteel filled with a weak saline solution similar to thos found in sensory deprivation tanks, furthering the freakish B-movie parallels. An offshoot of research involving self-sustaining cybersystems, the Animus adapter was originally designed as a cadiovascular backup -- a piece of drop-in metabolic machinery serving as a go-between bridging biological and mechanical energy sources, setting up a mutual recharge cycle in much the same way as an automotive alternator. As is too frequently the case, however, initial conceptions gave way to unforeseen incidental applications, and the theory of the thing was quickly surpassed by its practice. Hundred of these grotesqueries are said to line the innermost chambers of Pentex and Developmental Neogenetics Amalgamated laboritories. System: When installed alongside a cadiovascular bionic conversion, the Animus adapter functions as expected - the system both regulates (as would a pacemaker) and revitalizes. Treat Stamina as the user's +2 for purposes of soaking damage or resisting unconsciousness, and as effectively unlimited for prolonged or steady exertion (load-bearing or running). The adapter uses only the wearer's digestive and respitory systems for fuel (which it in turn replenishes). An unaided human adrenal system may be coupled with an adapter, but is quickly outpaced (and fatally over-stressed) by its energy consumption. This has led to the commission of heinous deeds in the name of science; rumors abound regarding comatose human batteries wasting away in Animus cylinders, slow-acting systems introduced into hospital and life-support equipment, and even more unspeakable atrocities. Bionics/Cybernetics[ ] Variable Rank, Gnosis (2+Rank); alternatively Device 1-5 From fantastic machinations of Asimov and Gibson to crudely-fashioned appendages dating back to dynastic China, the marriage of man and machine has been a longtime dream of scientists and storytellers. Though widely regarded as science fiction even by the World of Darkness' diverse denizens, a select number among the Glass Walkers and Hakken know otherwise from firsthand experience, and distressing rumors abound regarding tragic DNA experimental subjects and sinister perversions wrought by Pentex technicians. So-called 'basic' bionic/cybernetic modifications (that is, those without subsidiary spiritual attachments (Gifts et al. ))artificially augment physical and/or perceptual attributes. Examples include: - Alloyed Endoskeleton Appearance] ...as well as half a hundred other artifacts of cyberpunk legend. Of somewhat more scholarly interest in recent years is the introduction of 'chipware' -- miniaturized units of throaway memory, hardwired directly into the lower mnemonic centers surrounding the cerebral cortex and stem. Although unimaginably expensive, prohibitively difficult to come by, and often incompatible with individual brain chemistry, this cunningly-guised biotechnology offers quick and comparatively easy alternative to the tedium of subliminal learning or by-the-book instruction. System: One additional point in any Attribute (or ability, in the case of chipware) per Rank is a good rule of thumb for basic bio-booster hardware. Additional effects (e.g., multiple Attribute/Abilitiy bonuses, powers mimicking those of other fetishes and/or Gifts) may be added on a point-for-point basis (using the rank of the fetish(es) or Gift(s) in question)... with their own associated spiritual issues and negotiations, of course. Halve the benefits, however, if dealing with implants that can shapeshift to match a shapeshifter's various forms; ego, a shapeshifter's four-dot cybernetic limb only grants two dots of Attribute modifiers. In no cases will a shapeshifter's body accept an implant that isn't a fetish - even technomagick isn't capable of adapting to the half-spirit nature of the Changing Breeds. Players and Storytellers should keep in mind the potential hazards of mismatched muscle groups and unrehearsed physical activity; an over-enthusiastic guinea pig who attempts a 75 mph sprint on same-day cyberlegs or a series of fresh-chipped circular kicks without an accompanying regimen of physical conditioning is going to be in for an unpleasant surprise when she tears multiple muscles and surrounding ligaments. But the physical dangers of overpressure pale before the psychological. Although it seems second-nature to us, the cerebral burden of controlling four autonomous appendages is computationally daunting, and tampered with only at great risk to the experimenter. Radical bionic replacement (or installation of any additional limbs) invariably results in unwanted side effects, from psychosomatic discomfort (cramping/muscle seizure, sever migraines, phantom pain) to irreparable emotional trauma (antisocial Derangements, autism, withdrawl, even catatonia) to subtler internal complications (such as the onset of Parkinson's Syndrom or similar degenerative nervous conditions, given the morbid moniker 'Black Shakes' by fanboy Cyberphreaks). These risks (and subsequent afflictions) should increase in frequency and severity with the Rank of the fetish(es) in question, and are left to the Storyteller's discretion. Lucid[ ] Device 1 Closely related to its parent drug, mild hallucinogen LAE-23 (lysergic acid ethylamide, once peddled on the city streets under the questionable name \"Pink\"), several variations on this peculiar pharmaceutical are used by certain special operatives and security forces throughout the world. Though still weak and unpredictable in its efficacy, this sensory stimulant has rapidly emerged as foremost among several recent developments threatening the integrity of the Veil...and the future of the Garou. Long-term exposure to Lucid catalyzes a subtle and not-yet-completely-understood psychoactive process, expanding the user's perceptions in one direction while dulling them in others. System: Users of Lucid operate at a penalty of one die from their Wits-based dice pool, but add one additional die to Delirium rolls for every consecutive twenty-four period during which they have ingested the drug (Bonuses are cumulative, to a maximum of five additional dice after five consecutive days.) Frequently-severe reactions and side effects have prevented the migration of this additive into human society (drinking water and commercial foodstuffs, for example); with the recently-redoubled efforts of such agencies as Interpol's Odessa Alternative or the United States Department of Defense Special Affairs Division, however, the lives of innocents may be luxuries their respective administrations feel they can no longer afford to preserve. Triton[ ] Device 2 Named for an implacable sea-god whos whim saw sailors to safety or the grave, the Triton additive may in time render SCUBA (Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus) and other oxygen-storage gear obsolete. SEAL Team Six and its collaborative American/Norwegian naval researchers are its only known source. Triton is a superoxygenated fluorocarbon suspension (in effect, liquid oxygen at room temperature) that, for a short time, replaces the human circulatory system's need to breathe. The additive comes in three forms: bottled liter-sized breathers (by far the most common), time-release gel capsules, and intravenous injections. Using any one of these three, a human recipient may function underwater for a period of one to three hours (dependent on body weight and exertion level); subjects must consciously fight off the instinct to breath, however, or they will be in for an unpleasant surprise (water-filled lungs) upon surfacing. System: Triton has no side effects per se, but those operating under its influence in an oxygen-rich environment (i.e., the surface) will experience slight dizziness and disorientation (equivalent to mild hyperventilation); subtract one die from Dexterity-and Wits-related rolls until the drug runs its course through the user's system. Eternity[ ] Device 2 One might at first believe this cosmetic product to be the handiwork of Magadon, Pentex or some similar subsidiary of the Wyrm. Comprised of antioxidants, moisturizers, and other unspecified \"rejuvenative agents,\" it certainly fits the description of any number of so-called \"Fountains of Youth\" too good to be true. Eternity differs, however, in that it realy does work - to hold back the biological clock while attempting, unsuccessfully, to help the user emotionally acclimatize himself to potential immortality. Prohibitively expensive and distributed only in circles of the social elite who can afford its particular brand of magic, Eternity comes in small jars of cosmetic cream, which are rubbed into the skin all over the subject's body. Dermatologists have access to significantly stronger solutions, similar to cortisone in texture and consistency, which can be injected directly into fleshy deposits (bags beneath the eyes, jowls, love handles) as would be any topical steroid. The drug (whose precise composition is still a mystery to modern science) accumulates in the user's system, and takes three to four weeks before changes become visible. Once activated, however, the effects are obvious and impressive; wrinkled and/or spotty skin regains a smooth, even appearance. Pigment is reallocated to the flesh and hair, restoring color and bestowing something of a \"baby-face.\" Even physiological symptoms of old age (joint pain, lack of recall) are held somewhat in check by Eternity; whereas a septuagenarian will not snap into the body of a twenty-year-old, he or she will take on a somewhat younger appearance (such an individual might be mistaken for fity or even forty-five), maintaining that appearance for as long as he or she takes the drug. As if addiction to immortality were not enough of a caveat, however, there are other risks. The self-same agents that preserve physical and synaptic function have been perceived to induce unknown and unpredictable side effects within the cognitive and emotional centers of the brain. Longtime users of Eternity gradually become colder and more distant over time, less emotive, less \"human\" (treat as Humanity loss if you own Vampire the Masquerade) - sometimes becoming sociopaths or even serial killers. Toroidal Electromagnetic Repulsor[ ] Device 2 Short, squat, and surprisingly heavy for its size (60cm diameter, perhaps 90 kilograms), this space-age repulsor (actually a miniature yttrium-barium arsenide accelerator) is currently the most powerful man-portable electromagnet on the planet. Commonly deployed in dozens, they are beginning to see use by law enforcement and military agencies in the establishment of invisible barriers and secure weapon-free perimeters. When activated, the TER (or \"donut\") brings an extremely powerful magnetic field into being, which is itself toroidal in shape (making the magnet a donut within a donut, so to speak) and extends approximately five meters in every direction from the device's center. The magnetic field is perceived at its periphery as a gradually-increasing elastic barrier, and, needless to say, repulses iron, steel, and other ferrous metals (even aluminum, brass, and lead castings which contain impurities and/or trace elements left over from their molds). Miraculous though the toroid might seem, it does have its drawbacks. The magnet is bipolar; that is, metallic objects introduced into the \"hole\" region of the \"donut\" (unlikely as that is to occur) would be attracted with force equivalent to the repulsion which occurs externally. More to the point, the electromagnet uses up its power supply very quickly; a TER runs on thin-film nickel-cadmium batteries chosen for their robustness and reliability over higher-tech alternatives, but exhausts them in a matter of minutes (half an hour of continuous use). Spares must be kept on hand and ready to swap on very short notice. Each TER incorporates a remote activation/deactivation device, to prevent its users from being caught in the magnetic field; this control, however, can be imitated or simply stolen. Can it have escaped the attention of the TER's designers that even the human bloodstream is laced with iron-rich hemoglobin? System: Closer to the center (two to three meters), repulsion occurs with extreme force (well over 1500 foot-pounds); even a supersonic bullet cannot pass through the field without significant deflection (treat Firearms rolls as difficulty 10, and even that only after extensive study and practice with the trajectory in question). Large metallic objects slide or topple radially away from the TER's center, while smaller ones (less than 45kg) will frequently tear loose of their moorings (if anchored) and/or take flight (possibly causing injury). Note that a single human body will not carry sufficient weight to successfully anchor an object; those entering the field must let go of their metalic possessions or be carried with them. Gyrojet Pistol[ ] Device 2 Although self-propelled rocket ammunition technology existed as early as World War II, it was shelved by most nations after a preliminary analysis showing the projectiles to be impractical and unsafe. (This opinion was seconded on the field following a tragic series of explosions resulting from Russian tank turret-thrown rockets). In the World of Darkness, however, desperate times often necessitate desperate measures. Two competing corporations have submitted gyrojet prototypes for the military market's perusal; Heckler & Koch's SRP (still being tested) and the Israeli Military Industries (IMI)'s Vanguard (available in limited production). The Vanguard, a (marginally) handheld sidearm similar in size but heavier than its predecessor (the IMI Desert Eagle), sports a fully-shrouded 6\" barrel and slabside profile. Its twin-spring launcher works in conjunction with a delayed-thrust mechanism to ignite rocket projectiles after (and only after) they have cleared the barrel; needless to say, botches rolled while using this weapon should have catastrophic consequences (misfire or explosion). Expansion of this design into a gyrojet rifle is unlikely; for the size and weight, you're better served using a LAW or similar device. Nonetheless, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is currently considering the 12.7mm sagittarius round as a possible successor to the 9mm Parabellum. This news, accompanied by reports of newly developed smartweapon and microelectronic guidance systems, may make the proverbial \"bullet with your name on it\" a terrifying reality. |IMI Vanguard| |Caliber||Difficulty||Damage||Rate||Clip||Conceal||Range| |12.7mm||8||12*||2||6||J||40| - Damage is dependent on ammunition used; current standard-issue is high-explosive. Treat as aggravated damage. DERVISH (DExterous Remote Vehicle, Ishapore Series)[ ] Device 3 Based on full-body waldo designs for HAZMAT and hostile-environment applications, this state-of-the-art feat of mechanical engineering appears at first glance to be a metallic mockup of a diminutive (approx. 140cm tall) human skelton. Networks of cables, pneumatic pistons, and microservos run alongside the alloyed 'bones,' and redundant ocular sensor arrays give the 'head' a rather disturbingly skull-like appearance. Units are frequently outfitted with mission-specific equipment, SCUBA-derivative gear for aquatic operation, or even camouflaged in clown garb or other innocuous-seeming attire. One DERVISH unit, generally believed to be property of the LAPD (who affectionately refer to it as \"Arnie\"), has been lovingly detailed with stenciled labels proclaiming it a \"Cyberdyne Systems Prototype,\" product of \"J. Cameron Engineering.\" System: Although the system takes a little getting used to, the DERVISH vehicle, through a complex series of joystick grip-actuators and stirrup-pedals, potentially affords an operator full motor control of a remote set of limbs and sensors (treat as operator's Dexterity - 1; the one-die penalty may eventually be overcome with time and training). Telemetry with the head-mounted audio and visual recorders (which extend into ultraviolet (night-vision) and infrared (thermal-vision) spectra) provides a virtual realtime what-you-see-is-what-you-get navigator's interface. In a pinch, the DERVISH may even be used in combat; its four-fingered hands (the fourth is an opposable thumb) are capable of balling into fists or open-handed slaps, as well as picking up and operating whatever objects and/or weapons prove necessary for the task at hand. (The unit possesses a high degree of manual strength, but suffers from asymmetry, imbalance, and an extremely lightweight frame; treat Strength as 4 for crushing and/or gripping, 1 for all other purposes. The endoskeleton is lightly armored and has three soak dice). Storytellers may wish to assign operators a new Skill, Pilot (Waldo Vehicle), after a sufficient breaking-in period. Work is already underway to improve upon the DERVISH design; the next generation of such devices, custom-tailored for specialized applications such as dance choreography, are rumored to incorporate inverse-kinematic interfaces ties directly to a full-body suit worn by the operator, whose physical motions guide and drive the vehicle. Clearly the unmanned-technology revolution begun by such innovative pioneers as Project Pilgrim and the Voyager space probe is far from over... Cerebral Conditioning Systems[ ] Device 4 These devious little items, each no larger than the head of a match, are as close as the mortal world has yet come to the \"mind control\" theme recently popularized by conspiracy theorists and science fiction enthusiasts. The 1990s version of the \"Queen of Hearts trigger\" is actually an experimental union of several pioneering technologies. Fiber-optic shunts piggybacked directly onto the surface of the brain are used to stimulate pain and pleasure centers (in accordance with obedience and disobedience, respectively) during the first few weeks of conditioning. Microdiffusers tied to the recipient's glandular system time-release mild narcotic agents, pituitary extracts, and adrenal additives directly into the spinal column. Inner-ear implants emit carefully-selected subharmonics of the 443Hz tone observed to induce susceptibility to suggestion [This last effect is clearly audible (if difficult to pinpoint) to those using the Heightened Senses Gift or some equivalent.] System: The conditioning relies on time and repeated exposure, though long-term recipients gradually slip from eager-minded receptiveness into a slack-jawed, unquestioning zombie state. Roll the target's Willpower (difficulty 8) for each week of continuous exposure. Success means no change for that week, failure a permanent decrease in Willpower by one. At Willpower of two or three, the subject is under more or less complete control; below this number, the target becomes all but a mindless vegetable in need of coaching to exercise or even eat. Myrmidon Exoskeleton[ ] Device 4 Mechanized monstrosities torn whole and beating from the stuff of science fiction, these anthropomorphic harnesses, built on ultra-lightweight carbon-composite frames and microsecond-response myomer fiber networks, represent mankind's latest attempt (spearheaded by those \"in the know\") to take the fight back to the Changing Breeds. However the prototype design was conceived, its inspiration appears to have spread like wildfire; at least ten of these exoskeletons occupy a secure annex of Massachusetts' Hanscom Air Force Base (developed and funded under the auspices of \"construction/hostile environment operations\"), and additional units have been unveiled in selective screenings held before the United Nations' Nuclear Security Council. Furthermore, 'Web-distributed bootleg satellite photos purportedly taken over Siberia strongly suggest that these battlesuits (or at least their primitive predecessors) have seen more than their share of action since the dying days of the Cold War. Obviously influenced if not outright controlled by some paranormal-savvy organization (Developmental Neogenetics Amalgamated, Special Affairs Division, Pentex, Shinzui, or the like), these man-sized assault vehicles, although considerably slower and clumsier than their furred-and-fanged counterparts, are more than capable of holding their own in a fight against supernatural opponents. But what, wonder armchair soldiers and joint tactical commanders alike, were these behemoths forged to fight? System: The Myrmidon stands approximately nine feet tall and features a three-quarter-ton servo-driven chasis (Strength 6, Stamina effectively unlimited for purposes of lifting or running). It operates on crude electrostimulus from a trained pilot, handles more like a forklift than a piece of Japanese animation (treat Dexterity as operator's Wits minus two), and bristles with armor as well as armaments (Armor Rating 5, choice of arm/shoulder-mounted .50 caliber turrets (difficulty 7, damage 8, burst-capable), 30mm cannon (difficulty 7, damage 10, burst-capable); needless to say, these features are not generally made known to those outside the laboratory). Tempest-hardened, silver-alloyed, and aquatic variants may also exist. "}
