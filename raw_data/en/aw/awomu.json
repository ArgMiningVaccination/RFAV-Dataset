For patients suffering from allergies, their allergic reaction is triggered by allergens. Antigen stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies. White blood cells recognize the antigens as a foreign substance and produces specific antibodies to attack the antigens. The body then becomes sensitive to antigens and antibodies. Depending on which organ is affected, the white blood cells release inflammatory mediators which cause allergy symptoms. For example, if the skin is affected, a rash appears. If the eyes are affected, the eyes become irritated. If the nose is affected, you have a runny nose. In the case of Lupus, the responsive mechanism is similar to allergies. Allergens stimulate antibody production. Antibodies combine with body cells and constantly stimulate the immunity. Likewise, inflammatory mediators are constantly released which can result to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) or other autoimmune diseases. Allergies, Lupus and autoimmune diseases are immunity disorders. Treatment with Allergostop which uses the patient's personal antibodies that recognize his or her own allergens making this vaccination a highly personalized solution. Allergostop treatment A blood sample is drawn from the body and left until the red blood cells precipitate. The above layer of lymph which contains antibodies is activated. This is done through Absolute Health's own scientific formula (Technological Intellectual Property) which has the ability to change the antibody molecules to new antigens which can help to adjust the white blood cells function. New antigens turn lymph or plasma into the vaccine. When the lymph is injected back into the body, the lymph vaccine triggers white blood cells to eliminate the allergens or bad antibodies which are unnecessary for the body. The basic idea of Allergostop treatment is the extraction of pollutant from the body to form the key component of the vaccine. Then, it is reintroduced into the body to boost the immunity against all forms of allergens and pollutants which can cause a lot of harm. It is as the saying goes \"fighting fire with fire\". Recommendations: It is easier to identify the allergens if the blood is drawn when the allergy symptoms are present. Therefore, you should take the blood sample when the allergy symptoms show. Who is Allergostop for? - Allergy patients - Patients with autoimmune disease - Patients with lupus such as SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), SNSA - Patients suffering from chronic diseases related to immunity, such as diabetes, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease - The elderly. Older folks have lower immune function. Allergostop treatment can adjust the reaction of the immunity. Treatment frequency Each blood sample can produce 50 vaccine injections. The injections are divided into 2 phases: - Phase 1: 25 vaccine injections - Phase 2: 25 vaccine injections. (The second phase is applied if no improvement is seen in Phase 1) The vaccine is injected subcutaneously (under the skin layers). The syringe is as small as a syringe for insulin injection. The vaccine is injected daily around the navel. For patients who are not available to come on a daily basis, they will be taught to self-inject for home use. The injections should be applied at the same time every day to achieve the optimum results. If the injections are not applied at the same time every day, the immunity's stimulation will not be consistently stable. Caution Allergostop is a vaccination made from one's own antibodies. Therefore, some patients may experience a reaction during the initial injection. Once the body can adjust to the allergens, it will be able to better tolerate the allergens. Recommendations In case if a reaction occurs during the first phase injection, one is able to take vitamins and dietary supplements in accordance to the medical recommendations of the doctor. This would assist in suppressing the inflammation caused. In addition, the vaccination in the second phase may be titrated accordingly to minimize the reaction of the vaccine. "}
