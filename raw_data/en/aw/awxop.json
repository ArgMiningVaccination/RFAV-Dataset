Following the five general 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines (for ages 2 and older) can help you stay on track. Established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Guidelines can assist you in making the healthiest choices for you and your family.Your days are full, and it may feel like you're moving at warp speed. It's easy to get stuck in the same routine for things such as meal planning, exercise and work. But sometimes, it's good to step back and think about those routines and choices to ensure you're optimizing your health and well-being. Our Guide to Living Well can help you make informed decisions about the health care you and your family receive, as well as provide exercise guidelines and ideas for making the most of every day when it comes to nutrition and managing stress. A healthy eating pattern limits:1. Follow a healthy eating pattern throughout your life. 2. Focus on variety, nutrient density and amount. 3. Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats, and reduce sodium. 4. Switch to healthier food and beverage choices with less sugar. A healthy eating pattern includes: Fruits Vegetables Protein Dairy Grains and oils Saturated fats & trans fats (less than 10% per day)Added sugars (less than 10% per day)Sodium (less than 2,300 milligrams per day)Alcohol (one drink per day for women and two per day for men and only by adults of legal drinking age) 1Meaningful Labels Animal Welfare Approved (AWA): This label, certified by the non- profit organization A Greener World, guarantees that animals are raised outdoors on an independent farm using sustainable practices. No antibiotics (except to treat sick animals) or growth hormones are used. Certified Humane : Seen on eggs, this label, certified by the nonprofit Humane Farm Animal Care, indicates that the producers meet a list of animal care standards, including adequate space, quality feed and environmentally friendly production and processing. Organic: Foods labeled \"USDA Organic\" must consist of at least 95% organically produced ingredients. The other 5% must be approved on the national list provided by the USDA. They cannot be produced with any antibiotics, growth hormones, pesticides, petroleum or sewage-sludge based fertilizers, bioengineering or ionizing radiation. The USDA strictly regulates organic product labels.Supermarket Savvy Good nutrition stars with smart choices at the grocery store. While you probably already shop the perimeter of the grocery store, where the fresh foods such as fruits, vegetables, fish and dairy are located, you may need some assistance deciphering the dizzying array of food labels. Deciphering what the terms mean will help you choose the best options for you and your family. For more information, visit Consumer Reports Greener Choices website at https://greenerchoices.org/. 2Lacks standardization Cage-free: Most often seen on egg cartons, it means egg-laying hens are not held in restrictive cages. However, the birds can still be raised in extremely confined surroundings, with limited room to roam and move around. If seen on poultry products, it is meaningless as birds raised for meat in the United States are not typically caged. Free-range: Seen primarily on poultry products, this term implies the birds spend some time outdoors. There is no standard for this term, and it is not regulated. Grass-fed: Seen most often on beef and milk labels, grass fed indicates that some of the animals' diet came from fresh pasture or dried grasses such as hay. Look for labels that include certification by the American Grassfed Association or AGW. These programs certify that the animals were fed only grass and forage with no grain and on pasture, not in confinement. The United States Department (USDA) does not regulate how the term is applied on products. Can be misleading Gluten-free: This is meaningless when it is on products that were already gluten-free, such as rice and chicken. If you are trying to avoid gluten, this label is helpful when it is on products that traditionally contain gluten, such as breads and other processed foods. Low-Fat: The FDA defines a low-fat food as containing 3 grams or less of fat per serving. However, it is not synonymous with low-calorie. Multigrain: This indicates that the product is made with more than one grain, and some may be highly refined. Look for 100% whole wheat or whole grains for a healthier choice. Natural: There is minimal government regulation of this term. Generally, according to the USDA definition, food labeled natural does not contain artificial ingredients or preservatives, and the ingredients are minimally processed. However, they may contain antibiotics, growth hormones and other similar chemicals. Omega-3 Enriched: Seen on eggs, this claim indicates that Omega-3 fatty acids, such as flaxseed, algae or fish oil, were fed to the hens who produced the eggs. Pasture-raised: This label indicates that the animals were raised for at least some portion of their lives on a pasture or with access to a pasture and not continually confined indoors. There are no government agencies that verify or oversee the claim. 3Fitness for You Women especially need to make time for fitness. With all the demands on your time, whether that is work, family or school, it's easy to forget that you need to keep yourself healthy and happy. Take advantage of opportunities to incorporate fitness time into your busy schedule: Schedule your workout like you would a work meeting or appointment Break 60-minutes of exercise up throughout the day into three 20-minute sessions Walk during your lunch break Learn to delegate and make exercise a priority Keep workout clothes in your trunk or desk Get up 30 minutes earlier three times a week to exercise Partner with a friend with the same fitness goals Take the stairs when you can Exercise while watching your favorite show on TV Walking the dog counts, as do household chores, such as yard work and mopping Types of activity Aerobic activities Aerobic activities include those activities in which you move large muscles for a sustained period of time. To get the best results from aerobic exercise, exercise within 55 to 85 % of your maximum heart rate for at least 20 to 30 minutes, according to the American Heart Association. Your maximum heart rate is calculated by subtracting your age from 220. Aerobic activities include tumbling, brisk walking, running, hopping, skipping, dancing and bicycling. Muscle-strengthening Muscle-strengthening activities make muscles do more work than usual during activities of daily life. For children, these can include playing on playground equipment and climbing tress. For teens and adults, they often include more structured activities, such as lifting weights or working with resistance bands . Bone-strengthening Bone-strengthening activities produce a force on the bones of the body that promotes bone growth and strength. They can also be both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities such as running, jumping rope and tennis. Get Moving Regular physical activity is a must for maintaining good health and reducing the risk of chronic disease throughout all stages of life. Consistent physical activity fosters normal growth and development in children and can make everyone feel better, and even sleep better.Family Fitness Fun Prioritize a healthy lifestyle to help your family get fit and establish lifelong fitness habits. Try a few of these easy fitness tips to get your family moving: Take after-dinner walks together Play hide and seek Take a bike ride Have picnics in the park or at the beach and throw a ball or fly a kite Take a family hike Turn on the music for a family dance party 4Check out the recommendations established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Preschoolers (3 through 5 years) Should be physically active throughout the day Reasonable target is 3 hours per day of activity Engage in active play and structured activities, such as games and riding a bike School-aged children (6 through 17 years) Should do 60 minutes (1 hour) or more of moderate to-vigorous activity daily Aerobic activity should comprise most of the 60 minutes Muscle-strengthening activity should be included 3 days a week (in the 60 minutes) Bone-strengthening activity should also be included at least 3 days a week (in the 60 minutes) Adults (18-64 years) Should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) to 300 minutes (5 hours) per week of moderate-intensity exercise, or 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) to 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity Should also do muscle-strengthening activities of moderate or greater intensity that involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days per week Should move more and sit less during the day Gain additional health benefits by participating in physical activity beyond 300 minutes of physical activity per week 5 1. Identify your stress triggers A daily stress journal can help you identify the regular stressors in your life and how you manage them. Write down what caused your stress, how you felt (both emotionally and physically), your actions and what you did to make yourself feel better (if anything). 2. Practice deep breathing The next time you feel your shoulders tightening take a few slow, deep breaths. It will give you time to decompress and slow down your heart rate. 3. Relax your muscles Start at your toes, tensing and relaxing each muscle. Systematically move up your body. Manage Stress You know stress can drain you. Constant stress can raise cortisol and deplete serotonin levels, impairing your cognitive thinking and your immune system, so you aren't at your best. While avoiding all stress in your life is not possible, learning how to manage stress is. You're already poised for healthy diet and exercise success, and the following tips can further help you destress and savor the good things that come your way! 4. Meditate If you are new to meditation, consider taking a class or joining a mediation group to get started. There are also several apps that have thousands of mediations from which you can choose, such as Insight Timer. Most are free with optional in-app purchases. Meditation takes many forms and can reverse your body's stress response and help you physically relax. 5. Set aside time for yourself Include rest and relaxation in your daily schedule. Schedule an hour (or as much time as you can) to yourself each day to relax, take a bubble bath or call a friend. 6Health Hacks for Busy Women We'll let you in on a secret that helps busy women like you: easy tricks support you in maintaining optimal health and managing your fast-paced life.1. Stock your pantry and refrigerator with healthy options Throw out the junk and have fresh fruit and vegetables on hand. 2. Listen to music Depending on what you choose, music can relax you, motivate you, improve performance and even help you focus. 3. Spend less time on social media It's easy to get sidetracked by social media and end up wasting time and feeling as if you need to post an Instagram-worthy image now. Turn off all social media notifications, consider a \"no social media before noon\" standard or try a screen-free Saturday. 4. Start and end each day with water Bookend your days with water to stay hydrated. Drink a few cups in the morning and at the end of your day to help ensure your body is getting enough water. 5. Get up earlier Give yourself enough time to ease into the day, whether that is handling office politics, or keeping kids entertained or both. Take the extra time to sip a cup of tea, read a book or write in your journal. 6. Take a mid-day stretch break This will boost your energy, improve your focus and benefit your mood. 7. Workout online Online workouts offer a convenient way to exercise. You can try everything from traditional aerobics to ballet to high-intensity interval training routines. Videos offer a wide range of time intervals, and many are free. 8. Forget about multitasking Focus on getting one thing done in a designated amount of time before moving on to the next. 9. Get some fresh air Spending time outdoors will energize you and give you a chance to breathe. 10. Eat snacks Don't allow yourself to get ravenous. When you get too hungry, you lose the ability to make good decisions. When your kids get too hungry, they might be heading for a melt-down. 710 Tips to Live a Healthy Life The simplest things are often the best if you want to feel your best. 1. Don't smoke 2.

Now it's time to make sure you have the best health care to support your choices and lifestyle, because where you get your health care matters. Choose your doctor Choose a primary care doctor you can connect with. Your primary care doctor's goal is to provide you with an individualized health care plan that delivers the care that's right for you, taking into account your personal preferences and health history. Once you've chosen and met with your primary care doctor, who can be a family medicine physician or an internist, be sure to schedule annual check-ups so you can discuss your concerns and overall health. Routine care also builds on your health history and provides you and your doctor with the big picture. In addition, annual check-ups, routine screenings and tests may reduce long-term health care costs. If you have children or are pregnant, a pediatrician will serve as your child's primary care doctor from birth through the teen years and young into adulthood. If you are pregnant and deciding on a pediatrician, schedule a prenatal, \"get-to-know\" you visit during your third trimester.Care when and where you need it Illness and injury happen at any time, so it's important to know where you can go if your primary care doctor is unavailable. Your in-person choices are same-day clinics, urgent care or the emergency room. Always go to the emergency room for serious or life-threating medical emergencies, such as broken bones, chest pain, serious burns or a head injury. Emergency rooms are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and are equipped to provide rapid and advanced treatments that are only available in a hospital. Call 9-1-1 if you have any doubt and always call if there is severe chest pain, severe bleeding or signs of a stroke. When you have a non-life-threatening injury or illness, urgent care is a good option. Urgent care centers can treat a variety of medical issues that need to be treated within 24 hours. Examples of conditions that can be diagnosed and treated at urgent care include dehydration, fever without a rash or lacerations that may require stitches. Scripps HealthExpress clinics offer walk-in, same-day care for minor illnesses and injuries, such as urinary tract infections, earaches, the flu and coughs. No appointment is needed. HealthExpress also provides additional services, such as sports physicals, and they are a good option when you or someone in your family has an everyday illness. Most visits are billed as a primary care visit. 9To find a primary care doctor at Scripps, visit scripps.org/findmydoctor or call 858-295-3008 .The free Symptom Checker service assesses symptoms and recommends options for care.
