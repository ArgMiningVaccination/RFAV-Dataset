I created it after seeing so many folks finding their systems completely unbalanced in dealing with all the signals that came from that: mood swings, skin issues, digestive problems, sleep difficulty, hair loss, you name it! I've had wonderful feedback on the assistance that this brew can bring. You may see symptoms get a little stronger or change during the balancing process. Only continue if you feel comfortable and safe with the changes. This one is definitely best drank daily for optimal balance. There is a tincture version of this if you prefer ;) Ingredients: VITEX BERRY (CHASTE caffeine free \u00bacertified organic Options: Loose Leaf ~ 2 & 4 oz We're happy to hand bag this blend for you...

Teaching Herbalism Through Tea Craft I created this blend from years of my own experience needing increased support in areas of hormonal balancing, reproductive organ support, and overall wellness. I needed to be as nourished and balanced as possible due to dealing with hormonal imbalance, PMS, endometriosis and uterine fibroids. I struggled greatly with inflammation, scar tissue, and pain as a result of these issues and knew I needed to reach to my herbal companions for support. After creating this blend, I realized its comprehensiveness for many. I've witnessed many women finding great support from this blend for a variety of reasons ranging from PMS to infertility. Each herb brings a specialty: Vitex is an incredible hormonal balance supportive herb. I have yet to meet an herb that does a more impressive job working with the female organ system to create a better balanced state. Specifically, estrogen and progesterone balance. I added dandelion root as the perfect liver tonic that seems to have an affinity for helping the liver break down excess estrogens allowing for a better balanced state and acting in great support to the vitex berry. Violet leaf is a moistening, cooling, lymphatic tonic wonderful for nourishing tissues dealing with growths and/or inflammation. Shatavari is a well known Ayervedic female system tonic, adaptogen. and nutritive tonic. I invited raspberry leaf to the party for its tonic properties it brings to the uterus and reproductive system. Lemon Verbena is a lovely aromatic herb with soothing properties offering flavor and benefit just as Rose petals are more than just a lovely flavor. They bring anti inflammatory, soothing, and uplifting properties uniquely their own. This blend is most helpful drank daily if you are seeking balance or aid in a specific area. It could take a couple of months to see the benefits clearly as they are working WITH your body for your body to do the work. If simply seeking a nourishing blend for your female organ system, drink as often as you like and soak up the love you receive in each sip.
