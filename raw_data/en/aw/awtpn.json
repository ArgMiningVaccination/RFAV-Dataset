Nikola Tesla said,\"If you want to find the secrets to the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibrations.\" He was way ahead of his time. Or, behind, depending on how you look at it. Since the civilizations of old knew about these sorts of things before the world forgot them. Though they were never completely abandoned, for good reason, and are now beginning to slowly come back and become common knowledge again. When you understand that everything is energy, you understand that everything can be manipulated. It's all about positive and negative ions if you wanna get sciency about it. Since energy is neither created nor destroyed, but instead continuously transferred from one place to another, the goal is to intercept as much energy as you can and direct it toward the thing or goal you have in mind. Most people label energy in the body as whether you feel tired or not. This is a correct definition, of course, but by far not the only one. Energy powers more than just your drive to get up and do something. It drives your creativity, your ambition, your happiness. Energy flows to every aspect of who you are and powers your ability to feel, think and act upon it all. When you encounter a problem such as low physical energy, depression or even lack of money, it's because your flow of energy has encountered a block and needs to be cleared in order to continue to flow properly and get to where it's suppose to be. Everything is energy. Many people use the chakra system to heal energy flow. The chakra system is a system throughout your body where energy whirlpools, per say, as it flows through the body. When a chakra encounters a block of sorts, you see the results manifest in physical and mental ailments. There are 114 chakras in the body but for simplicity's sake we'll focus on the main seven everyone else pretty well acknowledges. Start small! [The first chakra (Muladhara)](http://vannasana.com/root-chakra/)is known as the root chakra. It's associated with survival and instincts and is located at the base of the spine. [The second chakra (Svadisthana)](http://vannasana.com/sacral-chakra/)is known as the sacral chakra. It's associated with emotion and creativity and is located in the lower abdomen. [The third (Manipura)](http://vannasana.com/solar-plexus-chakra/)is called the solar plexus chakra. It's associated with confidence and self worth. It's location is the upper stomach area. [The fourth (Anahata)](http://vannasana.com/heart-chakra/)is the heart chakra, located at the, you guessed it, heart! It controls love, happiness and peace. [The fifth (Visuddha)](http://vannasana.com/throat-chakra/)is the throat chakra, located at so and has to do with truth and self expression. [The sixth chakra (Anja)](http://vannasana.com/third-eye-chakra/)is the all seeing third eye and is located in the center of the forehead. Intuition, wisdom and imagination stem from it. [The seventh chakra (Sahasrara)](http://vannasana.com/crown-chakra/)is the crown chakra, located at the top of the head. Connection and spirituality is what it majors in. When the chakras are all aligned and in tune with one another, you find yourself thriving and able to accomplish anything in your path. When they are not all aligned, you have to heal your energy blocks to restore flow. How do you clear energy blocks? Why! I'm glad you asked! If you encounter any types of [ energy blocks](https://energymattersllc.com/blogs/news/what-are-energetic-blockages) there are many ways to heal them. - Cleanse/Detox Our world these days is such a toxic one. There are harmful chemicals in nearly everything we touch and use on a daily basis. Regardless of what sort of block you are dealing with, a cleanse or a detox might be a good way to go. These work best with digestion or nutritional issues. If you are prone to colds or general sickness it could mean you have some clogs from toxins or a poor diet. They can also help with mental blocks too, though. Chemicals can manipulate hormones which can have you all out of whack. It's that mind body connection everyone talks about. If your hormones aren't balanced, physical and mental blocks alike can be effected. Cleaning out all the piping will do you some good and fix many issues you may be having. We should all do this routinely every couple of months or so to make sure everything's clean and flowing properly. 2. Heal Energy Blocks With Reiki Reiki is a healing technique used by reiki masters to channel energy through the body to clear blocks and restore flow. They can aid the natural healing process and do wonders for both physical and mental ailments. This is a great way to heal energy blocks. 3. [Meditation](http://vannasana.com/meditation/) Meditating on your blocks will help you clear them, as the body is naturally meant to do. You can focus on one chakra at a time by imagining a swirling pool of light or water. See it swirling effortlessly and smoothly. Do this with each chakra, moving from one to the next. You can hold your right hand over each chakra and move it in a circular motion, helping it along if you like. Since each chakra controls and influences certain aspects of you, both your thoughts and actions, keeping them clear is very important to well rounded physical and mental health. You can meditate on a thought or ailment you would like to clear. You can imagine the word or phrase and see it dissipate from existence. Practice makes perfect. If you're new to meditation, it may seem silly at first. Just stick with it though. Trust me, you'll have good results, and it'll get easier as you get use to it. 4. Eat Correctly I wish I could tell you the one specific diet you should eat to have the best results in everything you wish to accomplish. However, the truth of the matter is that everyone is different. What effects one person negatively may not effect another in the least. It all stems back to your particular ancestors and what they were use to eating. Therefore, evolving your body to process that particular diet efficiently. The best way to figure out your ideal diet is to experiment with your body. Try eliminating one or several things at a time. After a week or so, all of it that was in your body should have more or less processed out. Take a note on how you feel. Introduce one thing at a time back into your diet and take note of how you feel after eating each item. Do you feel bad after eating some dairy? Are you bloated and gassy after eating bread? Did that sugar make you feel anxious? Keep a journal of everything you eat and everything you feel so that you can begin to see connections. Adjust your diet appropriately because that's legitimately the only way to do it. Your perfect diet is unique to only you. 5. Sunlight Sunlight naturally clears blocks and recharges your energy. Everyone should be getting at least a little sun everyday. I know it's harder in the winter. Try opening up all of your curtains to let as much natural light in as possible. It will help. 6. Feng Shui This is one of my absolute favourite things to do! I feng shui everything! Feng shui is an ancient art of a science that arranges things in specific colors, orders and patterns to allow for optimal qi (energy) flow. It's super detailed and intricate and deals with the five elements: Earth, water, wood, fire and metal. Your house and workplace should follow the laws of Feng Shui. Any where you spend a lot of time. Start small. The most important places to start with are your work place and your bedroom since that's generally where you spend the most time. I'm working on a post for you to teach you some basics! How exciting! I'll keep you posted. 7. Heal Energy Blocks With Yoga You know me. I couldn't possibly offer you a list of solutions that didn't include yoga, now could I? Yoga helps energy flow by working out the muscles and ligaments. By strengthening the channels through which energy flows through the body, said energy can flow more efficiently. 8. Unplug Being around electronics all of the time really messes with our natural energy. The energy from the machines intertwines with our own and causes disruptions. If we're constantly plugged in, which most of us are, it can manifest in all sorts of problems; mentally and physically. Taking just thirty minutes or so to get away from our technological world will help you in restoring flow. The more time you take away, the more benefits you'll see. 9. Breathe I saw something once that said something along the lines of, we have forgotten how to breathe in the energy of the universe, and thus, forgotten in large how to heal, live and be. There are tons of breathing techniques out there all aimed at one specific thing or another. I like to just focus on breathing deeply and often. Breathing will help you heal, detox, focus and clear any block you need to clear efficiently. 10. Mindset Mindset is everything. The way you think and speak directly relates to your actions and the energy you put out into the world. You get back what you put in right? If you only put out negative energy, you will only receive negative in turn. Like wise, if you put out positive, you will receive positive. Very simple math. Pay attention to how you speak. Instead of \"I don't have any money.\" try, \"I'm going to find me some money.\" You speak your truth. No matter what your truth is. You decide. 11. Odds and Ends - Lemon Essential Oil will help improve physical energy. - Vitamin C will help with these things. - Burning sage will help clear negative energies.
