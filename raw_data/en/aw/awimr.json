It includes modern and traditional, scientific, and empirical methods to aid in this healing process. Naturopathic Doctors (NDs) are trained in both natural and conventional medicine. Our members are graduates of four- year, graduate-level naturopathic medical school and are educated in all of the same basic sciences as an MD or DO. They are also trained in holistic and nontoxic approaches to therapy with a strong emphasis on disease prevention and optimizing wellness. In addition to a standard medical curriculum, the naturopathic physician also studies clinical nutrition, homeopathic medicine, botanical medicine, psychology, and counseling. A naturopathic physician takes rigorous professional board exams so that he or she may be licensed by a state or jurisdiction as a primary care general practice physician. Our members collaborate with Oklahoma licensed health care providers to provide safe and integrative, natural health care. They understand the importance of making medically appropriate referrals and will do so as needed.
