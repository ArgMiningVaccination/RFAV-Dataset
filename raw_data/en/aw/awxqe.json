In creating this policy NHS England has reviewed this clinical condition and the options for its treatment. It has considered the place of this treatment in current clinical practice, whether scientific research has shown the treatment to be of benefit to patients, (including how any benefit is balanced against possible risks) and whether its use represents the best use of NHS resources. This policy document outlines the arrangements for funding of this treatment for the population in England. Our policies provide access on the basis that the prices of therapies will be at or below the prices and commercial terms submitted for consideration at the time evaluated. NHS England reserves the right to review policies where the supplier of an intervention is no longer willing to supply the treatment to the NHS at or below this price and to review policies where the supplier is unable or unwilling to match price reductions in alternative therapies. Equality Statement Promoting equality and addressing health inequalities are at the heart of NHS England's values. Throughout the development of the policies and processes cited in this document, we have: Given due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, harassment and victimisation, to advance equality of opportunity, and t o foster good relations between people who share a relevant protected characteristic (as cited under the Equality Act 2010) and those who do not share it; and Given regard to the need to reduce inequalities between patients in access to, and outcomes from healthcare services and to ensure services are provided in an integrated way where this might reduce health inequalities Plain Language Summary About cancer in children and young people Cancer in children and young people is rare. In the UK, approximately 3,800 children and young people (under the age of 25 years) are diagnosed with cancer every year (Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group, 2014). The types of cancers affecting children and young people are different to those that affect adults; these cancers tend to occur in different parts of the body to adult cancers and respond differently to treatment. The most common cancers affecting children and young people are cancers of the bl ood, such as leukaemia, and lymphoma. About current treatments Treatment for children and young people with cancer depends on the type of cancer. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which may be given in combination. Treatment with chemotherapy is intensive and can include multiple medicines. Anthracyclines are a group of chemotherapy medicines that work by stopping cancer cells from replicating. This group of medicines are commonly used to treat children and young people with leukaemia or lymphoma. Despite these medicines achieving high cure rates (almost 80%) they can cause long-term side effects including damage to the heart, known as cardiotoxicity. This damage means that the heart becomes weaker and is not as efficie nt at pumping blood around the body. These effects may not be seen for some time after treatment finishes. About the new treatment This policy outlines the use of dexrazoxane to prevent cardiotoxicity in children and young people aged under 25 years where it is planned for them to receive high- dose anthracyclines for cancer. Dexrazoxane belongs to a group of medicines which protect the heart from damage. Dexrazoxane is a cytotoxic drug, i.e. it is toxic to living cells and it is unlicensed in the treatm ent of children and young people receiving anthracycline- based chemotherapy. This policy for the use of dexrazoxane treatment, as outlined above, is not specific to a particular disease or tumour group. What we have decided NHS England has carefully reviewed the evidence to treat cardiotoxicity in children and young people where it is planned for them to receive high- dose anthracyclines or related drugs for the treatment of cancer with dexrazoxane, either as a front line- treatment or combined with other treatments . We have concluded that there is enough evidence to make the treatment available. 1 Introduction Clinical indication Anthracyclines (such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin and idarubicin) and related drugs (e.g. mitoxantrone and pixantrone) are chemotherapy agents used to treat cancer in adults and children. However, their use is limited because they can cause damage to the heart (cardiotoxicity), especially at higher dose s. This damage to the heart may eventually lead to irreversible heart failure. Damage to the heart associated with anthracycline therapy can be classified as early or late cardiotoxicity. Early cardiotoxicity develops during anthracycline therapy or in the first year after finishing treatment. The earliest point at which late cardiotoxicity becomes apparent is one year following completion of treatment with anthracyclines. The risk of developing heart failure remains a lifelong threat, especially to children who have a long life- expectancy after successful treatment for cancer ( van Dalen et al. 2011) . Most paediatric cancer treatment protocols avoid high cumulative doses of anthracyclines. However, a small number of children with cancer do require high cumulative doses of anthracycline. These children are at high- risk of acute anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Around 1 in 10 childhood cancer survivors who receive an anthracycline develop a symptomatic cardiac event over time. People treated with a cumulative anthracycline dose of 300 mg/m2 doxorubicin or equivalent are 23 times more likely to develop cardiac dysfunction (abnormality or impairment of the heart) compared to people who are not treated. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of non- cancer - related morbidity and mortality in people who survive childhood cancer ( Shaikh et al. 2016). Intervention Dexrazoxane belongs to a group of medicines which protect the heart from damage. It is administered by a short intravenous infusion (15 minutes), approximately 30 minutes prior to anthracycline administration. Dexrazoxane is unlicensed in the treatment of children and young people aged under 25 years where it is planned for them to rec eive high- dose anthracyclines or related drugs (doxorubicin 300 mg/m2 or more or an equivalent dose of another anthracycline). Although unlicensed, dexrazoxane is not contraindicated in this population. However, dexrazoxane is contraindicated in children a nd young people aged 18 years and under who expect to receive a cumulative dose of less than 300 mg/m2 of doxorubicin (or the equivalent cumulative dose of another anthracycline). It is important to note that there is a dexrazoxane preparation licensed for the treatment of extravasation (leakage from a vein into surrounding tissue) and this treatment is excluded from this policy. 2 Definitions Anthracycline Anthracycline related drugs A type of chemotherapy used to treat cancer. These medicines are derived from antibiotics and work by preventing cell replication. The medicines classified as anthracyclines are: (i) doxorubicin; (ii) epirubicin; (iii) daunorubicin; (iv) idarubicin; (v) estramustine; and (vi) vairubicin. These drugs are not classified in the anthracycline drug family, however, have the potential to cause significant cardiotoxicity. These medicines are: (i) mitoxantrone; and (ii) pixantrone. Cardiotoxicity Damage to the heart. Second malignant neoplasm A histologically distinct second cancer that develops after the first. Sub-clinical cardiotoxicity Asymptomatic changes in echocardiographic measures beyond specified thresholds (for example, a decline in ejection fraction to <50% shortening fraction to <28%, or a decrease of 10% from baseline). [definition used in Shaikh et al. 2016] Troponin -T A protein released when cardiac muscle is damaged which is a marker of cardiac damage. 3 Aims and Objectives This policy considered: Dexrazoxane to treat cardiotoxicity in children and young people where it is planned for them to receive high- dose anthracyclines or related drugs for the treatment of cancer. The objectives were to: establish, via an evidence review, the following information: Safety and effectiveness of the treatment; Cost effectiveness of treatment; and Identification of sub- groups and clinical criteria. 4 Epidemiology and Needs Assessment Cancer in children and young people is rare. In the UK, approximately 3,800 children and young people (under the age of 25 years) are diagnosed with cancer every year (Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group, 2014). The spectrum of cancers affecting children and young people is vast, however, the most common cancers are cancers of the blood such as leukaemia and lymphoma. Children and young people with either acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or bone sarcomas are most likely to be in the cohort of patients that would receive dexrazoxane. A 2012 National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN) report on childhood tumours registered with children's cancer and leukaemia groups between 1977- 2011 (for children aged under 15) showed an average (mean) of 88 AMLs a year, and an average (mean) of 20 bone cancers each year. Both AML and bone cancers are more numerous in teenagers and young adults aged 16- 24 years than those aged less than 15 years (Office of National Statistics, 2017, as cited by Cancer Research UK). The Pol icy Working Group estimate that, based on this information, at least 108 children and young people a year may be eligible for dexrazoxane. However, because this policy for the use of dexrazoxane treatment is not specific to a particular disease or tumour group, the actual number of eligible children and young people who may receive high- dose anthracyclines for all diseases and tumour groups may be higher. 5 Evidence Base NHS England has concluded that there is sufficient evidence to support a policy for the routine commissioning of this treatment for the indication. This review considers the evidence for using dexrazoxane to prevent cardiotoxicity in people aged under 25 years where it is planned for them to receive ant hracyclines (cumulative dose of doxorubicin 300 mg/m2 or more or an equivalent dose of another anthracycline) for cancer. Anthracyclines (for example, doxorubicin and daunorubicin) are effective chemotherapy medicines for cancer in adults and children and young people. However, their use is limited because they can damage the heart, especially at higher doses. Most paediatric cancer treatment protocols avoid high cumulative doses of anthracyclines; however, a small number of children and young people do need high doses of anthracycline and are therefore at increased risk of cardiotoxicity. Over time, around 1 in 10 childhood cancer survivors who received an anthracycline have a symptomatic cardiac event ( Shaikh et al. 2016). It is unclear how anthracyclines damage the heart, and how dexrazoxane might prevent this damage. Anthracyclines form complexes with heavy metals, particularly iron, producing free radicals that can damage heart cells. Dexrazoxane also bonds with metals, which can prevent the formation of anthr acycline and heavy metal complexes and harmful free radicals. This may be how it prevents the heart being damaged. Using dexrazoxane to prevent cardiotoxicity in people aged under 25 years is controversial. In 2011, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) rev iewed dexrazoxane ( EMA: dexrazoxane 2011), noting the limited efficacy data in children, and the results of 2 studies that reported an increased risk of second malignant neoplasms (a new primary cancer in a person who has had cancer in the past) in children treated with the medicine. Following this review, dexrazoxane was contraindicated in children and young people aged under 18 years. The EMA reviewed dexrazoxane again in 2 017 ( EMA: dexrazoxane 2017). This new review concluded that dexrazoxane can improve surrogate cardiac markers (scan results or laboratory measures suggesting how well the heart is working, which may or may not be related to actual clinical outcomes, such as heart attacks or heart failure) and did not appear to affect survival in children with second malignant neoplasms. Following this review, the contraindication was removed f or people aged under 18 years who were receiving a cumulative dose of doxorubicin of 300 mg/m2 or more (or equivalent anthracycline). This evidence review includes a systematic review and meta- analysis of five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 12 non-randomised trials (Shaikh et al. 2016). One of the RCTs was only available in abstract form at the time of the Shaikh systematic review; therefore, extra outcomes from the fully published study ( Asselin et al. 2016) are also included, as are longer -term mortality data from a follow -up study of three of the RCTs in the Shaikh systematic review ( Chow et al. 2015 ). Dexrazoxane did not reduce the rates of clinical cardiotoxicity (for example, heart failure, heart transplant or death because of a heart problem) in children and young people compared with no dexrazoxane in the five RCTs included in the system atic review. However, it should be noted that the rates of clinical cardiotoxicity were low across the RCTs, with only three cases reported. Heart failure develops over a much longer time in children and young people compared with adults receiving cancer treatment, meaning a very long follow -up would be needed to see a clinically significant difference in symptomatic heart failure. The systematic review and additional RCT assessed surrogate markers for cardiac damage, as well as actual clinical outcomes such as heart failure. For example, troponin release after anthracycline- based chemotherapy has a correlation with statistically significant decrease in left ventricular function (Cardinale et al, 2000; Cardinale et al., 2006). Children and young people t reated with dexrazoxane were significantly less likely to have raised troponin -T (a surrogate marker, high levels of which suggest the heart muscle is damaged). They also had less reduction in left ventricular fractional shortening and a better left ventr icular thickness -to-dimension ratio (measures of the heart's ability to pump blood around the body). While fractional shortening is a direct measure of heart function, troponin release and left ventricular thickness -to-dimension ratio are surrogate cardiac markers and it is unclear whether they predict either long -term cardiac dysfunction (abnormality or impairment of the heart) or heart failure; therefore, these results cannot reliably be used to determine the long -term cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxa ne. There was no statistically significant increase in the rate of second malignant neoplasms up to around 10 years after treatment with dexrazoxane in the systematic review. Higher rates of second malignant neoplasms seen in children treated with dexrazo xane in individual RCTs may be because of an increased risk of second malignant neoplasms when dexrazoxane is used in combination with other cancer treatments. The long -term risk of second malignant neoplasms in children treated with dexrazoxane is not cur rently known. Up to a 12- year follow -up, dexrazoxane did not have a detrimental impact on overall survival, event -free survival or disease progression in children and young people receiving anthracycline- based chemotherapy in the studies included in this review. However, the impact of dexrazoxane on these outcomes in the longer -term is not currently known. Adverse events were reported in one RCT included in this review. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities (severe, life -threatening or disabling adverse events) repor ted in people treated with dexrazoxane included infection, haematological effects (conditions affecting the blood), mucositis ( painful inflammation and ulceration of the mucous membranes lining the digestive tract ) and central nervous system (brain and spi nal cord) events. Other adverse events listed in the SmPC as being very common (occurring in 1/10 people or more) for dexrazoxane include nausea, vomiting and alopecia. 6 Criteria for Commissioning NHS England will commission dexrazoxane to prevent cardiotoxicity in children and young people in accordance with the criteria outlined in this document. Inclusion criteria Dexrazoxane to prevent cardiotoxicity must be considered in all children and young people aged under 25 years where it is planned for them to receive doxorubicin with a cumulative dose 300 mg/m2 or more (or the equivalent cumulative dose of another anthracycline or related medicine) for the treatment of cancer over the entire lifetime of treatment, either as a first line treatment or combined with other treatments. The use of dexrazoxane is not specific to a particular disease or tumour group. Starting criteria Approval for use of dexrazoxane for each patient will require a multi -disciplinary team (MDT) discussion either at the Children's Cancer MDT or the relevant site- specific MDT for teenagers and young people with cancer. Dexrazoxane dose should be that equal to 10 times the doxorubicin- equivalent dose. Equivalence and conversion of related drugs (such as mitoxantrone and pixantrone) should be considered as part of the treatment planning process. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) summary of product characteristics (SmPC) contains advice on dosing in renal impairment and further information. When decidi ng whether to use dexrazoxane prescribers should consider the short - and long -term risks associated with this product (e.g. myelosuppression - bone marrow suppression), alongside possible benefits in relation to protection of the heart. At higher doses of chemotherapy, where the dexrazoxane dose exceeds 1000 mg/m2, myelosuppression may increase significantly as outlined in the SmPC. The consent for treatment must include any proposed dexrazoxane and its associated side effects. Treatment pathways and deci sion-making will adhere to guidance in the relevant children and young people's NHS England cancer service specification(s) and NHS England policy on Commissioning Medicines for Children in Specialised Services. Duration of anthracycline infusion Due to the short half -life of dexrazoxane, the anthracycline must be given alongside dexrazoxane over a period of one hour or less. Stopping criteria There are no specific criteria relating to treatment cessation for dexrazoxane in this population group. See MH RA SmPC for further details on adverse events. Exclusion criteria Use of dexrazoxane is unsuitable in children and young people (please refer to the MHRA SmPC for latest guidance): Where it is planned for them to receive a cumulative dose of doxorubicin < 300 mg/m2 or an equivalent dose of another anthracycline or related drugs. With hypersensitivity to dexrazoxane. Where the child or young person is breastfeeding their own child. Receiving concomitant vaccination with yellow fever vaccine. Who requi re continuous infusion of anthracyclines over a period of longer than one hour. 7 Patient Pathway Children and young people with cancer may be treated in either a Children's Cancer Principal Treatment Centre, a Paediatric Oncology Shared Care Unit (POSCU), a Teenage and Young Adult (TYA) Principal Treatment Centre and/or a TYA Designated Hospital, using pathways outlined in the service specification(s) for children and young people with cancer. All treatment must be delivered in accordance with local Children's Cancer Network and/or local TYA Cancer Network protocols. 8 Governance Arrangements Servic es must be delivered in accordance with the relevant service specification(s) for children and teenage and young adults with cancer. The use of dexrazoxane in children is unlicensed. Each provider organisation treating children with a medicine approved un der this policy will be required to assure itself that the internal governance arrangements have been completed before the medicine is prescribed. These arrangements may be through the Trust's Drugs and Therapeutics Committee (or similar) and NHS England c an ask for documented evidence that these processes are in place. Further details on the use of dexrazoxane can be found within the MHRA SmPC. Provider organisations must register all patients using the NHS England prior approval web-based system and ensure monitoring arrangements are in place to demonstrate compliance against the criteria as outlined. 9 Mechanism for Funding Treatment will be funded by local specialised commissioning teams, through established funding routes for children and young people's cancer services . 10 Audit Requirements Any audits should be carried out in line with local network protocols and the relevant service specification (s) for children and young people with cancer . 11 Documents which have informed this Policy This document has been informed by: NHS England. 2019.
