The short answer is: yes. Water brings balance to the body and takes care of important everyday functions, such as regulating body temperature, lubricating joints, and getting rid of toxins and waste. When we get sick, one of the first instructions a doctor gives is to drink plenty of clean water like [FloWater](https://www.drinkflowater.com/). It keeps everything flowing nicely within our bodies and helps us to stay hydrated and in good health. Following healthy habits helps to protect the body, including the immune system, and gives you a greater chance to stave off illness. Strengthening your immune response system includes getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, and incorporating frequent exercise into your daily routine. While these best practices should be followed on a regular basis to maintain the strength of your immune system, they are even more important during the winter when cold and flu season is on the rise. Protecting your immune system is important now more than ever to keep the body strong. In addition to drinking at least eight glasses of water a day, it's important to add water-based foods to our diets, such as fruits, broths, and other liquids that don't contain excess sugars or chemicals. Furthermore, the more active we are, the more we must drink water to replenish lost fluids. Water's Impact on the Immune System As We Age As we age, our immune response systems function to weaken, which leads to a higher probability of infection or disease. Generally speaking, a strong immune system is able to fight off viruses and/or extreme reactions to them. Also, staying properly hydrated can help reduce inflammation and tissue damage, which keeps the joints loose and aids in preventing serious injuries. Proper nourishment from a well-balanced diet and consistent proper hydration are key. While drinking water does not prevent contracting illness or disease, it does help the body fight against it for faster recovery time and less long-term impact on the body. Like all areas of maintaining proper health, the act requires the repetition of different habits working together. For example, exercise is valuable but doesn't have the same positive effect if you're not not eating well or drinking enough water. Being intentional about your health is the only way to ensure you are getting enough hydration (as well as proper nutrients, rest, and exercise) throughout the day. Rather than fighting off illness, it's better to do as much to prevent it from occurring in the first place. Drinking Water As a Proactive Measure to Preserve Health Drinking water to boost the immune system must occur daily. Waiting until you are thirsty means you are already partially dehydrated. There are physiological changes that take place in this state. It affects your level of physical performance. Since exercise is a mainstay of supporting a healthy immune system, when you don't drink enough water, it's difficult to maintain a continuous and/or vigorous exercise regimen. Also, when exercising, especially in warmer temperatures, you lose electrolytes, like sodium and potassium, and this leaves you feeling depleted of energy and lowers your endurance. Drinking plenty of water also helps to promote cognitive performance. Dehydration makes it difficult to concentrate and stay alert. This could start a domino effect of other symptoms like lethargy, headache, and an inability to get enough sleep from setting in, all of which affects the immune system in a negative way. Staying hydrated keeps the builds a strong immune system strong. To maintain exceptional health and hygiene, it's important to regularly: - Drink 64 oz. of water or more per day - Sleep at least eight hours per night - Exercise a minimum of 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week - Eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables - Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds - Keep surfaces clean and sanitized - Limit direct contact with others who are ill Many people follow these habits on a regular basis, while others may find it easier to incorporate some more than others. Each is equally important to strengthen the build a strong immune system and keep us in good health. Keep in mind, you can split up drinking water and exercise throughout the day, which makes it easier to achieve the daily recommendations. Schedule three, 10-minute walks or other forms of exercise per day. Plan to drink at least one glass of water per hour. Also, having an accountability group makes it easier to maintain some of these habits, especially if you're having trouble reaching your water goal. Set an alarm, start a challenge among co-workers or friends, or keep a running tally of how much you drink per day. How FloWater Encourages People to Stay Hydrated With drinking water such an important part of staying healthy, you'd think it'd be an easier rule to follow. However, there are many reasons people give for not drinking enough water. They forget about it during the day due to hectic schedules. It's not convenient or cost-effective for them to drink water that tastes delicious. Or, they prefer to drink other beverages throughout the day instead. Whatever the reason is, FloWater provides a solution to encourage people to drink more water. FloWater's [bottle filling station](%20https://www.drinkflowater.com/the-refill-station/) transforms tap water so that it's great-tasting without the cost or plastic waste that comes with drinking single-use plastic bottled water. The purification process includes seven stages of filtration to ensure the water that remains is free of contaminants and other heavy metals but still has the minerals and electrolytes that help boost the immune system. Better yet, it delivers a cool, crisp taste dispensed at the optimal temperature for enjoyable drinking every time. FloWater's Seven Stages of Filtration The unique filtration process purifies and improves ordinary tap water by working as follows: - Step 1: Catches and removes dust, rust, and solid impurities from tap water and water pipes through a sedi-carbon filter. - Step 2: Removes all smaller particles, such as chlorine, hydrogen sulfide, and radon, and other toxins through a second carbon filter, which also gets rid of unpleasant tastes and odors. - Step 3: An advanced osmosis filter removes minute contaminants, such as bacteria, viruses, and dissolved solids, which has five times the efficiency of any other filtration systems on the market. - Step 4: The activated oxygen filter kicks off the next phase of the water purification process to improve the water. Activated oxygen naturally sanitizes the tanks and system and increases the amount of oxygen in the water to benefit your blood and muscles. - Step 5: A proprietary blend of ten trace minerals is added to the water to raise the pH level to neutralize acidity in the body. This helps to alleviate stress on the internal organs that comes from an imbalanced diet and environmental impurities. - Step 6: Supports immune cells and defense by adding in essential electrolytes (magnesium, sodium, calcium, and potassium), keeping you hydrated and energized. - Step 7: The final filter leaves the water with its cool, crisp finish, thanks to the coconut husks that capture and absorb any remaining contaminants, odors, and tastes. After the seven stages, what's left is 99% purified water that tastes fresh and has been enhanced to benefit your immune health. The way the water station is designed, it reduces the amount of contact needed to dispense water to minimize the spread of germs. The one-touch button dispenses any size of water container in the wide fill area. Furthermore, the recessed nozzle prevents the mouth of the cup, bottle, or jug from coming into direct contact. A hidden catchment tray and the self-sanitization from the activated oxygen reduces the buildup of grime, dirt, and germs like found with other public water refill stations. Both the design of the station itself and the various filters have the highest levels of safety, health, and hygiene in mind. Proper Hydration and Health Go Hand-in-Hand to Boost Immunity It can't be said enough: hydration is vital for your general health. Without it, there are obvious symptoms that quickly take shape telling us that our immune system is down. To maintain the body's natural defense against illness as best we can, it means changing the question of \"does drinking water boost your immune system\" to a statement that says, \"drinking water does boost your immune system.\" It's a fact that we need water to survive and keep our well-being intact. The quality of the best water to drink for health makes a difference in protecting the immune system as well. Often, tap water and outdated water systems contain contaminants that actually pose problems to our health rather than prevent them. In other cases, water filtration systems like reverse osmosis strip out the minerals that come from natural water sources. FloWater takes everything into consideration to essentially remove the bad and bring back the good. Drinking water has countless health benefits, in addition to how it helps us ward off illness and keep the body strong. Many of the best things we can do for our health start with simple habits: stay hydrated, eat a balanced diet, and move the body regularly. The more we pay attention to these routine tasks, the more easily it becomes part of an everyday lifestyle to always support our immune function properly. give a boost to our immune "}
