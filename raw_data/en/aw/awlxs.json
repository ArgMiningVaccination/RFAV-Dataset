Some early studies show that as many as 1/3 to 1/2 of people may have some symptoms that last more than 1 month, with some having symptoms for 6 months or more. Over 231, 987 (as of July 2021) Albertans have been diagnosed with COVID -19 so this could affect the health of many people. This rapid evidence review brings together recent studies to help doctors and other health care workers plan care for people recovering from COVID. Because most people have been infected only in the last year, there are no long- term studies - our knowledge is increasing as groups of people are assessed for longer times after their infections. A variety of terms have been used, and after reviewing all of them, we suggest that for now (until there are standard terms across countries) \"post -COVID conditions\" , or PCC as short form, should be used. \"Long COVID\" as a description is popular but may leave out some conditions that occur after hospitalization, as it seems to describe a particular set of symptoms in as currently used. Some groups internationally have used standard sets of qu estions to check people for their risk of post -COVID conditions, compare groups of patients, or follow how patients do over time. Although this may be quite useful, studies on how well the question sets work to identify people at risk and to follow their progress are still needed. There are not many good quality reports on how common post -COVID conditions are. Most studies are in people who had been in in hospital or ICU so this may not be the same for people who stayed home with COVID -19. Based on the studies we have, after hospital care for COVID -19 over 80% of people have at least one symptom at 1 month and over half still have at l east one symptom after 3 months. A number have studies looked at risk factors for post -COVID conditions. Fou r high quality studies found no specific risk factors for exper iencing post COVID conditions. The rest of the studies are not that good, but the ones that showed risk differences showed possible higher risk of post COVID conditions with older age (at least >60 years) (5 studies); being female (4 studies); and having other medical conditions (including lung disease, diabetes, heart failure and chronic kidney disease) (3 studies). Other risk factors from two studies each included White ethnicity, ICU admission, needing oxygen in hospital, and being male. Better studies are needed. There is no good quality evidence around whether vaccination may change post COVID conditions, although studies are happening. A few studies describe COVID -19 survivor s as requiring medical care after their initial infection through emergency departments, acute care, home care, outpatient specialty clinics, general practitioners, and telehealth lines. Surveys of people who have had COVID -19 show that 1/3- 1/2 do not return to work (early retirement), half or more miss days of work, and around one to two thirds say they are less productive at work. A more objective and standardized assessment of this is needed. The committee made 4 recommendations, suggesting the use of the term \"post -COVID conditions\"; using a list of identified risk factors; that Albertan h ealth care use data be assessed for post COVID healthcare patterns ; and that this review should be updated in 6- 12 months with new studies as many are happening now. 5 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Authorship and Committee Members Name Contribution Kiran Pohar Manhas Writing - Evidence screening and extraction; original draft preparation and editing Ceara Cunningham, Cyndie Koning, Jamie Boisvenue Writing - Evidence screening and extraction Nicole Loroff Research Librarian Brandie Walker Primary scientific reviewer Chester Ho Secondary scientific reviewer Lynora Saxinger & Scott Klarenbach Scientific Advisory Group chairs (oversight and leadership responsibility) L.

What are the most common terms and definitions used for symptoms that persist after resolution of suspected or confirmed acute COVID -19 infection across jurisdictions and what is the suggested terminology for Alberta? a. Are there validated screening or assessment tools for this phenomenon that may be used to identify patients requiring care linkage? 2. After a diagnosis of COVID -19, which symptoms (physical and/or neuropsychiatric) are most commonly noted to persist for at least 30 days after acute infection in children and adults? 3. Which patients with COVID -19 are at highest risk of developing these chronic symptoms? Is the severity of COVID -19 disease (e.g. hospitali zed; ICU) associated with the probability of developing post -COVID conditions? 4. Does COVID -19 vaccination impact the course of post -COVID conditions? 5. What are the potential health system impacts and what could be the health car e needs for patients with post -COVID conditions ( e.g., emergency department visits, hospital use, home care, rehab, community programs)? a. Is it anticipated that health system resource use would continue indefinitely (chronic disease model) or would this decrease over time? b. What are the implications for return to work for employees, their employers, and for health care workers involved in assessments of return to work? Context On November 30, 2020, the Scientific Advisory Group releas ed a rapid evidence review on chronic symptoms ( defined as 30+ days) after COVID -19 diagnosis, as well as the risk factors for, and the potential mechanisms of , these chronic symptoms. This review was requested due to growing recognition that a subset of patients recovering from COVID -19 experience symptoms after the acute phase of illness. Colloquially, these people are often termed \"long haulers\", and experience \"Long Covid\", which are two terms/hashtags increasingly prominent in social media and in patient -driven campaigns. Since that review, Alberta has seen two further surges i n cases of COVID -19. As of July 5 , 2021, 231, 987 individuals in Alberta were diagnosed with COVID -19 (Alberta Health, 2021) , with 9618 hospital admissions and 2, 301 deaths from COVID -19. A substantial population of survivors could be affected by these symptoms after COVID -19. Based on the prevalence rates of persistent sympto ms noted in the first Scientific Advisory Group review on post -COVID conditions , as many as 1/3 to 1/2 of the 231, 987 Albertans with confirmed COVID -19 and any unconfirmed cases may be affected by post COVID symptom s lasting at least a month . This review found the literature included hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients, and community based data was limited, including self reported disease and symptoms in social media based surveys but lacking population based survey data. In the November review, 46 unique chronic symptoms were noted from the literature , which involved diverse bodily systems. In that review, fatigue, headache and dyspnea were the most common chronic symptoms between 4- 6 weeks after diagnosis, and dyspnea and sleep impairments were noted from 8 -12 weeks. Between November 2020 and March 2021, t he Post COVID -19 Rehabilitation Response Taskforce developed an implementa tion strategy for a provincial P ost COVID Rehabilitation Response Framework. This framework informs screening, assessment and referral for care 7 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 across the continuum to support COVID -19 survivors with persistent symptoms and rehabilitation needs . Management of these post acute symptoms may require novel approaches and considerations.1 This rapid evidence review aims to support clinicians caring for patients during post COVID recovery and inform AHS based care planning . We sought to determine the current best evidence regarding the following elements of symptoms that persist or arise 30 days or more after COVID -19 diagnosis: appropriate terminology and definitions; available and validated screening tools; symptomatology (frequency); risk factors; impact of vaccination; impact on health services utilization; and, impact on patients' return to work. This evidence review is intended for clinicians and healthcare and public health decision- makers. Key Messages from the Evidence Summary Terminology & Definitions (based on 66 articles) o There is heterogeneity in the literature and no clear international consensus on definitions and terminology for prolonged symptoms after acute COVID -19 infection . o At least 22 unique terms are used . Some terms have several different definitions. Common points of contention include (a) when the \"clock starts\" on timing; (b) how long symptoms must persist; and (c) whether mechanisms inform inclusion. International consensus work is ongoing to clarify terminology and definitions. o \"Long COVID\" is a colloquial, non- specific terminology (14 articles with 9 heterogeneous definitions ) and is frequently used by patients and the media. Diverse definition s were related to it s use as a blanket term, its origins in a patient -driven movement, and an implication of a specific time- limited phenomena with a specific se t of symptoms, which may exclude some complications of severe acute COVID . o \"Post -COVID syndrome\" is used relatively consistently, especially with health organizations, to describe signs and symptoms attributable to COVID -19 infection that appear or persist 4+ weeks after diagnosis of infection . Qualifiers to \"post syndrome\" inform weeks after diagnosis; \"post -acute\" relates to symptoms that persist at 4- 12 weeks after diagnosis. However, \"post-COVID syndro me\" is an older term that is becoming replaced with \"Post -COVID condition or conditions\", as this may not be syndromic in nature, with the same definition and qualifiers attached. This term appears to have potential emerging consensus from the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Centers for Disease Control . Currently therefore, the term \"post -COVID conditions\" (short form PCC) has the most clear, consistent usage. Validated Screening or Assessment Tools (based on n=10 articles) o Use and utility of sc reening or assessment tools is not well developed, and these tools are not well validated. Thirteen tools were identified (n=10 studies) ; only the Short -Form - 36 (SF- 36) and Post COVID Functional Status (PCFS) Scale were used in 1 study . Most are used for assessment versus screening. o Four studies proposed the use of (or used) a suite of tools originally developed and validated in non- COVID settings . Six studies described bespoke COVID -19 specific assessment tools, most of which are not fully validated. All proposed tools and strategies attempt comprehensive assessment processes covering the diverse potential symptoms of post -COVID conditions . 1 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019- 2021 o Two papers attempted construct validation of two different tools. The PCFS Scale had modest findings relating to its construct validity (n=1,939) (Machado et al., 2021) . Machado et al (2021) found weak -to-strong statistical associations between functional status and all domains of the EQ -5D-4L (r: 0.233 -0.661); complementary but not statistically significant decreases in the PCFS Scale were associated with i ncreases in work productivity and activity impairment (Machado et al., 2021). Tran et al (2021) (n=351) described moderate or high construct validity of two complementary tools (Long COVID Symptom Tool (ST) and Long COVID Impact Tool (IT)) in the areas of functional status, quality of life and perceived health state. This evaluation used the PCFS Scale as the gold standard to examine construct validity around functional status. Other forms of validity have not been tested. Symptomatology (based on n=28 arti cles) o This question was addressed by a parallel, living systematic review completed by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). The PHAC did not include preprints and included articles until January 15, 2021. This Scientific Advisory Group review was more inclusive and included recent literature search until May 28, 2021. o The PHAC systematic review completed a meta -analysis on 28 observational studies that included individuals w ith laboratory -confirmed COVID -19. M ost studies had less than 200 participants. Most studies included hospitalized patients, but findings were mixed of hospitalized and non- hospitalized patients. Minimum follow -up was 4 weeks. o Over 100 post COVID -19 conditions were reported in laboratory -confirmed individuals. Eighty -three very low certainty ) reported persistence or presence of one or more symptoms in the short - and long-term, respectively. The most prevalent symptoms in both periods included: fatigue, general pain or discomfort, sleep disturbances, shortness of breath and anxiety or depression (point estimates ranging from 22- 51%; low to very low certainty ). o 19 studies were at moderate risk of bias and 9 were of high risk of bias ( GRADE tool), with common sources of bias as participant selection and poor objectivity/ validity of outcome measurement. o Results have limited generalizability to patients who experienced COVID -19 as an outpatient. Risk Factors (based on n= 45 articles) o Fourteen studies assessed chronic symptoms or manifestations of post -COVID conditions in patients who had been hospitalized for COVID -19; these cases involved primarily laboratory -confirmed diagnoses and used either administrative data or observation surveys (Table 3A). None of these studies used social media surve ys. o Four studies of high quality according to the adapted Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) found no risk factors were statistically associated with post -COVID conditions. Together, these studies examined 2,877 patients, with each study looking at a mean of 719 patients; two studies were specific to hospitalized patients. This adds uncertainty to the identified risk factors. o The outcomes assessed included composite outcomes of death, readmission +/ - new medical diagnoses, pulmonary function/CT scan findi ngs/symptoms, and various assessments of recovery to baseline Acknowledging this heterogeneity, t he most commonly -recognized risk factors that have statistically significant associations with post-COVID conditions in hospitalized patients include older age (at least >60 years) (n=5 studies); being female (n=4 studies); and presence of co -morbidities (including COPD, diabetes, heart failure and chronic kidney disease) (n=3 studies). Other noted risk factors by two studies each included White ethnicity, ICU admission, oxygen delivery in hospital, and being male. 9 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Of all the included studies, only one focused exclusively on pediatric populations (Osmanov et al., 2021). Osmanov et al (2021) found that in pediatric populations, risk factors for post -COVID conditio ns include older age (12 - 18 years old) and allergic disease. o There must be caution taken in interpreting the \"female\" and \"male\" risk factor, as the studies varied widely on whether they were capturing a gender identity variable or a physiological sex var iable; and on whether this information was captured through self - report or health team interpretation. o The most commonly -recognized risk factors that have statistically significant associations with post -COVID conditions in studies involving all types of C OVID -19 patients include older age (n=4 studies); multiple symptoms at acute infection (n=4 studies); studies); hospitalization (n=3 studies); and, presence of co -morbidities (n=2 studies). These risk factors do corroborate those found in the hospitalized- only populations. However, the age threshold for \"older age\" is not as clearly defined for the diverse populations in these studies. Impact of Vaccination (based on n=2 articles) o The body of evidence on vaccination implications for post -COVID conditions is very preliminary. Two moderate- quality, preprint articles (from UK) examined the relationship between vaccination and patient symptoms using observational cohort designs. Only 1 study directly addressed the impact of vaccination on post-COVID conditions . o This low quality evidence suggests that patients with post -COVID conditions (a) may experience more peri -immunization adverse events within 24 hours of vaccination, but (b) may e xperience improvements in the longer -term (e.g. symptom resolution or less progression of symptoms). The timing, likelihood and nature of such improvements is unclear and requires further rigorous , scientific study. Impact on Health Service Utilization (based on n=22 articles) o 22 articles informed this synthesis . They fall into 3 categories: (1) empirical studies that inform health service use by patients after COVID -19 infection (n=9); (2) empirical studies that provide limited insights (n=4); and (3) review articles that provide generic guidance and hypothetical considerations (n=9). o Adult COVID -19 survivors have access ed the following healt h services after acute infection: emergency department, acute care, home care, outpatient specialty clinics, general practitioners, and telehealth lines. o Adult COVID -19 survivors often undergo additional diagnostic testing and imaging after acute infection, including chest X -ray, blood tests, spirometry, trans -thoracic echocardiogram, autonomic reflex testing, as well as functional assessments (e.g. 6 - minute walking test ). o A proportion (18% per Menges et al (2021) ; odds ratio between 1.5- 3.0 per Ayoubkhani et al (2021) ) of adult COVID -19 survivors appear to receive new diagnoses of chronic medical conditions after the acute infection. Whether this proportion is consistently greater than age -matched controls is unclear. o The frequency and duration of health service use post-COVID -19 is not well described with only 2 studies identified: Lund et al (2021) suggested that most COVID -19 survivors have 1 general practitioner visit with a minority requiring 5 or more visits over the 6 months from diagnosis. Hernandez -Romieu et al (2021) found that the frequency of health service utilization post-COVID was 2- 24 visits per 10,000 person- days in 28- 59 days after C OVID -19 diagnosis relative to 1 -4 visits per 10,000 person- days 120- 180 days after diagnosis. 10 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 o The pr evalence of health service utilization post -acute COVID -19 ranged from 16 -40% up to 9 weeks post -discharge (D'Cruz et al., ; 29.4% al., 2021) ; 8.5% re -admission rate if sent home with supplemental oxygen (Banerjee et al., 2021) ; or 10% re -hospitalizations, 36% visited their general practitioner, and 7% called a medi cal hotline at least once (Menges et al., 2021) . o A limited number of studies suggest that health service utilization decreases over time. These studies o bviously do not extend beyond one year. Other papers suggest that post-COVID conditions have a relapsing- remitting nature and that follow -up for one year minimum is suggested. It is not possible to anticipate with any certainty whether health service needs will continue indefinitely or for a time- limited period. The data suggesting increased chronic medical diagnoses after active COVID -19 suggests prolonged or indefinite utilization might need to be the default for health service planning. Impact on Patients' Return to Work (based on n=8 articles) o On the basis of survey data, it appears patients with post -COVID conditions experience reduced workforce participation (e.g. early retirement) (31-54%), absenteeism (e.g. missed days) (48- 61%) and presenteeism (e.g. at work but less productive) (25-69%). No study comparatively assessed COVID -19 patients with and without identified post COVID conditions. o The prevalence of these work related issues was statistically lower at 6 months compared to 3 months from the time of acute infection (n=3 studies, 1 using administrative data) . A Norwegian study suggest ed that reduced workforce participation brought about by post-COVID conditions resolves by 3 months after post-onset of acute symptoms. Committee Discussion The committee reached consensus on the recommendations. For question 1, the committee provided feedback on the emerging consensus from public health organizations in Canada and US using \"post -COVID c onditions\" over \"post -COVID syndrome.\" It was conditionally recommended to align with this emerging, interim definition until international consensus is reached. For question 1a, the committee discussed the different purposes of screening versus assessment tools, that the to ols identified in this review were assessment tools ; the clinical role of such tools were also discussed and suggested clearer delineation between these . For questions 2 and 3, the committee discussed the importance of framing the evidence according to patient populations and methodology. In particular, research with only hospitalized patients cannot be generalized to community -only patients; and, research using laboratory -confirmed cases of COVID -19 has a level of rigour beyond that of t he studies using self report surveys via social media. For questions 4, 5 and 5a, the committee discussed the lack of research available on these topics, and that the guidance or recommendations should discuss research gaps and opportunities for the health system. Recommendations 1. Common terminology should be used to describe the phenomenon of persistent or emerging symptoms 4+ weeks after diagnosis with COVID -19. As consensus terminology evolves we recommend AHS adopt interim use of the term \"post -COVID conditions \", (PCC) with the qualifiers of \"post -acute\" or \"chronic\" as needed if focused on time periods 4- 12 weeks or 12+ weeks after diagnosis, respectively . Rationale: This recommendation is based on evaluation of the evolving terminology and reflects c urrent use in many organizations . This term has also retained a clear, consistent definition when used in the literature and by organizations. Other terms , such 11 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 as \"Long COVID, whic h is commonly used by patients and in the media, are associated with divers e definitions and may be more strongly associated with specific symptom complexes , which is less inclusive of some medical complications and affects clarity . 2. Evidence is insufficient to recommend specific standard assessment tool s for identification of patients with elevated risk of PCC, to screen for PCC, or to follow patients with clinically diagnosed PCC. If one of the reported tools is widely adopted by the AHS Post COVID rehabilitation response framework group, we recommend development of a validation framework to assess the performance and utility of the tool in our population. Rationale: The activities to support the implementation of the Post -COVID Rehabilitation Response Framework involve provincially consistent recognition of patients with post - COVID conditions . Currently the PCFS Scale is highlighted by this group, and although it has been cited in publications, i t has only been assessed for construct validity thus far. 3. Infrastructure and resources to s ustain analysis of organization- wide utilization of health services by Albertan COVID -19 patients should be provided to clarify health service utilization impacts of post -COVID conditions in Alberta. This research should be longitudinal, and extend beyond one year. Ration ale: A limited number of studies suggest that post -COVID conditions are associated with increased medical diagnoses and increased health services utilization, but that it may decrease over time. Because of the recency of the pandemic there are no present s tudies beyond 1 year in duration, with most much shorter. Some authors suggested that post-COVID conditions have a relapsing- remitting nature, although this was discussed more than empirically presented. Assessing health system impact requires a longer tim e frame of follow -up to determine the frequency, intensity and duration of increased health service use of people with positive COVID tests versus those without. As a provincial organization, Alberta Health Services is well -positioned to conduct this work and inform a substantial gap in the literature. 4. An update on this evidence review will likely be required in 6- 12 months' time as the literature matures, particularly relating to the questions on definition and terminology, screening and assessment tools, vaccination impact, health services utilization, and return to work implications. Rationale: The previous review examined symptoms and risk factors for post -COVID conditions ; the body of evidence has grown and become more consistent between the previous evidence review and this one on those two aspects. The body of evidence is inconsistent, limited and emerging for the other questions in this review. Definitive conclusions are difficult to make based on the current body of evidence. Practical Considerations Despite the emerging, inconsistent nature of the evidence, this rapid evidence review may inform decision- making although more robust evidence is needed . 1. While the validation evi dence is lacking to identify any gold standard screening or assessment tools, the PCFS Scale is the most widely used as an assessment tool and evidence is evolving on its psychometric validity. The current utilization of the PCFS Scale in the Post COVID Rehabilitation Response Framework is reasonable based on the current evidence base however it has only been formally assessed for construct validity and its usefulness in inform ing clinical care is not know n. 12 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 2. The available evidence on symptomatology and risk factors is described largely in hospitalized cohorts with varied post COVID outcomes of interest . More information is required prior to use of risk factor based tools to identify or screen for PCC. Higher quality evidence on risk factors (including in non- hospitalized patients), the probability that consideration of risk fac tors identify patients with PCC that would not have been identified otherwise, consideration of the impact of 'labelling' (i.e. informing someone they are at 'high risk' of PCC), and if early identification has a meaningful impact on health outcomes is needed. Preliminary risk factors have been identified for some post-COVID conditions based on current data (although due to the quality of the studies this is preliminary, and subject to bias and uncertainty). The more commonly identified factors (for rehospitalization, pulmonary function problems ) include older age (60+), hospitalization, female sex, having co-morbidities, having multiple symptoms during the acute phase, and need for critical care support , and in two studies each, other potential risks were white ethnicity, being male, ICU admission, and needing oxygen in hospital . 3. There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute any association between vaccination and post-COVID conditions symptomatology , with only two relevant preprint studies evaluated. One small study suggested that vaccinated individuals with PCC symptoms may be more likely to have improvement or at least plateau of their symptoms than unvaccinated individuals 4. There is emerging evidence that post -COVID conditions may result in increased usage of health services and impairment of some patients' capacity to return to work. The frequency and duration of these impacts is unclear based on the emerging evidence and more research is required. Research Gaps As stated above, there is a lack of robust research on the frequency and duration of symptoms acros s patient groups including in pediatric age ranges, where hospitalization is uncommon and the outcome of mild- moderate community based infection is not well assessed. Risk factors for the development of specific well defined post -COVID conditions are not w ell described. Stronger research in the future would corroborate self -report with administrative data; seek out both physiological sex and gender identities; and would ensure adequate representation from ethnic minorities as well as patients who did and di d not experience hospitalization due to COVID -19. Further, evidence on how (and if) risk factors can reliably identify patients at higher risk who would not otherwise have been identified, and whether early identification improves outcomes, or may \"label\" patients with negative impacts is required. Other areas of need include the impact of vaccination on post COVID conditions, which may be able to be assessed within post vaccination surveillance infr astructure; the implications of post COVID conditions on health services utilization; and, the impact of post COVID cond itions on patients' capacity to return to work are also not well described. It is recommended that upcoming research include appropriate control groups to allow for control of confounding fac tors. In addition, the onset date or time of diagnosis (rather than discharge date) should be when the \"clock starts\" on assessing time since acute infection, and would ideally look at key implications at several time- points in the post-acute (4- 12 weeks) and chronic (12+ weeks) stage, and go further into 6- 12 months post - diagnosis. Strength of Evidence The body of evidence varied greatly with the question at issue. This review included 7 distinct topics: terminology, screening tools, symptoms, risk facto rs, vaccination impact, health service 13 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 utilization, and return to work implications. The quality of evidence on question 2 ( symptoms ) is addressed by the PHAC in its systematic review and will not be discussed herein. According to th e adapted MMAT tool (Hong et al., 2018) , 44 articles were of high quality, 9 were of moderate quality and 13 were of low quality. This tool does not capture the full nuances of the literature and the opportunities for bias. The literature on risk factors was the most robust and informative. The literature on screening tools, vaccination impact, health services utilization and return to work implications was less robust. While articles spoke to some degree on terminology and definitions, the over -arching lack of consensus is not directly tied to evidence quality but rather the emerging nature of this syndrome and the pandemic illness as a whole. Limitations of this review The process limitations of this review centred primarily on the fact that there were 7 distinct questions that had to be addressed separately. The nature and time of the questions relative to the development and implementation of the search strategy meant that the removal of inapplicable articles happened at the reviewer -screening stage versus the librarian- search- strategy stage within a constrained turnaround time. While there were 15 review articles, only one was a rigourous systematic review and most did not detail their search strategies. This introduces concerns on the ability of those studies to unbiasedly inform the questions at issue. For the observational studies, whether observational cohorts or cross sectional surveys, there were several common concerns. S ome studies framed their design as an observational cohort but lacked any longitudinal features in implementation and were in fact cross sectional in design. Due to time constraints, we listed the design as proclaimed by the authors. A challenge in synthes izing the articles was the variation in defining the phenomena and the \"starting point\" of the follow -up time period. Implications vary greatly between follow -up that starts at symptoms onset or diagnosis, versus those that start at time of discharge. In the empirical studies, recall and selection bias were common concerns. For the latter, recruitment techniques did not favour generalizability with no study using a randomization approach. Some studies were site- specific, while others looked across a few hospitals and few considered population- level databases. Studies generally used convenience sampling or a sequential approach to participant recruitment/inclusion. Many studies relied on self -report, which is susceptible to recall bias. The few studies that used social media for recruitment had large sample sizes but limited generalizability , as only technologically -savvy individuals were recruited. Conversely, studies that used large administrative databases faced concerns on data accuracy. Only one study s pecifically targeted persons from minority communities, which queries the accuracy of findings related to ethnicity and diversity as the other studies may not be representative enough in that regard. Few studies had contemporaneous control groups. Potential confounding factors that limit any insight into causation include presence of pre- existing symptoms or conditions prior to COVID -19, treatment effects, impact of hospitalization or ICU admission, and the effects of the novel, global pandemic itself (e.g. barriers to care, psychosocial impacts). There was great variability in the sample sizes, and this corresponding to the heterogeneous data collection techniques: survey, administrative data, social media activity. The smallest sample size was 10 and the largest was 740,182. The median sample size was 417, which is relatively robust. This heterogeneity provided significant challenges in synthesizing the 14 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 evidence, particularly for the questions related to risk factors, health service utilization, and return to work impacts. Given the emerging nature of the pandemic and timeline since the introduction of the virus, the recommendations rely on preprints and peer -reviewed articles in equal stead. This review should be read as a rapid, emerging evidence summar y, rather than a rapid evidence review. Databases were searched for English- language evidence published in 2020, thus, evidence from outbreaks in jurisdictions where English is not common has not been included in this review. Summary of Evidence Literature for this review was collected from a database search covering Medline (OVID), Embase, APA PsycInfo, PubMed, TRIP Pro, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, WHO Global Research Database on COVID -19, National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Google, and Google Scholar . The search strategy involved combinations of keywords and subject headings including: \"COVID- 19\" and \"long -term.\" Because of the diversity of questions in this review, the literature search strategy was very broad, and the screening process determined inclusion as relating to the research questions. 389 articles (peer -reviewed and pre- prints) were identified by KRS with references and abstracts provided for further review. 29 additional articles were identified ad hoc . 418 articles were each independently screened by two reviewers using the title and abstract. After a title, abstract and paper review where each paper was assessed by two writers independently , 269 articles were excluded. Of the 149 articles that went to full -text screening, 82 were excluded by consensus of two independent reviewers. A total of four writers were involved in screening and extraction. The search was limited by the parameters of the questions: determining terms and definitions, or screening tools, or risk factors, or associations with vaccinations, or associations with health service use, or associations with return to work for symptoms that remain with COVID -19 survivors after the acute infection stage of COVID -19. The search was limited to English articles published 2020- current. Since this study was framed as an update to the November 30, 2020 review, articles were sought between November 4, 2020 and May 28, 2021. Articles were not excluded based on population. While the research questions framed chronicity as at 30 days or beyond the date of diagnosis, as discussed above, we did not limit the search strategy by specific date and sought articles that examined or considered symptoms in the non- acute infection period of COVID -19. The included studies were: 1 systematic review, 29 observational cohort studies (7 were pre- review), 11 cross sectional survey studies (3 were pre -review), 14 review articles (including narratives style reviews) (1 was pre- review), 1 quality improvement report, and 7 other style of reports and articles were included (1 was pre- review). The jurisdictional distribution of the studies was as follows: UK (n=19), USA (n=12), Spain (n=7), Denmark (n=2), Germany (n=2), Switzerland (n=2), and 1 each from Chile, France, Greece, Italy, Korea, Malaysia, Romania, Russia, Sweden, and the Netherlands. 15 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Rese arch Question 1 (Terms & Definitions) : What are the most common terms for and definitions used for symptoms that persist after resolution of suspected or confirmed acute COVID -19 infection across jurisdictions and what is the suggested terminology for Alberta? Evidence from secondary and grey literature In this synthesis on terminology and definitions for the phenomena of interest (i.e. symptoms that persist after resolution of suspected or confirmed acute COVID -19), we included all articles. This included 13 grey literature articles. They come from reputable organizations in Belgium, Canada, Norway, the UK, the USA and the World Health Organization. Evidence from the primary literature This synthesis on terminology and definitions includes 56 primary liter ature articles (43 peer- reviewed, 12 preprints). These articles arise from the UK (n=19), USA (n=12), Spain (n=7), Norway (n=4), Denmark (n=2), Germany (n=2), Switzerland (n=2), and 1 each from Chile, France, Greec e, Italy, Korea, Malaysia, Romania, Russia, Sweden, and the Netherlands. We used the adapted MMAT to assess the quality of the article as whole, and not specifically its approach to defining this phenomena of persisting symptoms after acute COVID -19 infection (Hong et al., 2018). With that in mind, 44 articles were of high qual ity, 9 were of moderate quality and 15 were of low quality. Synthesis of the Information Relating to Question 1 There is much heterogeneity in the literature and no clear consensus on definitions for prolonged symptoms after acute COVID -19 infection. At l east 22 unique terms are used; many individual terms have several different definitions attached to them (Table 1) . Definitions contain nuanced differences that are highly debated. There are distinctions on (a) when the \"clock starts\" on timing, (e.g. da te of first symptoms vs. diagnosis vs. hospitalization vs. discharge); (b) the timing within the definition itself (e.g. a syndrome or condition begins at what time after the \"clock starts\": 4 weeks, 2 months, 12 weeks, 100 days); and (c) whether or not to include previously -known causes of recognized signs or symptoms (e.g. post -ICU syndrome is included vs. must be ruled out ). The terminology is consistent in three areas: mentioning COVID -19 as the origins, language to describe the \"after\" or \"consequential\" nature of this condition, and definitions that encompass myriad symptoms and bodily system involvement. Several articles call for international consensus to determine disease definition and classification. The World Health Organization described such consensus building activities as planned, but the results of such consensus -building activities were not available at the tim e of writing this review . Importantly, 32 included articles did not attempt to define this phenomena, but rather focused on examining the long- term impacts, effects or health care needs after COVID -19 without using any terms or definitions . This may refle ct a confluence of the fact that there is no clear definition with the fact that it is still early in this disease's trajectory and researchers are approaching complications and sequelae more openly. 16 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 \"Long COVID\" appears as a more colloquial, non -specifi c terminology. Fourteen articles used this terminology, but we recorded 9 heterogeneous definitions. It is recognized as a patient - derived terminology; but it is used inconsistently in the scientific li terature. Sometimes, it is used (a) as a blanket term that covers many phenomena; (b) to refer the patient -driven campaign that brought this phenomenon to decision- makers' attention; or (c) a defined phenomenon with a specific time frame. Unfortunately, even with explicit definitions, the time frame associated with \"Long COVID\" is inconsistent (e.g. 28 days, 12 weeks, or 100 days). The NICE guidance is one of the earliest published, and seems to be the starting point for most subsequent articles. \"Post -COVID syndrome\" or \"Post -COVID condition(s) \" is used relatively consistently, especially with recognized health organizations, to describe signs and symptoms attributable to COVID -19 infection that appear or persist 4+ weeks after diagnosis. The \"condition\" terminology is valued for its appreciation of the diversity in the frequency, nature and duration of the signs and symptoms of this phenomena. a. \"Chronic\" or \"Persistent\" qualifiers are frequently added to \"Post -COVID conditions\" when those symptoms persist 12 or more weeks after diagnos is. b. Qualifiers for symptoms that persist between 4 and 12 weeks after diagnosis include \"post - acute COVID\", \"acute post -COVID\", \"subacute/ongoing COVID -19\" and \"ongoing symptomatic COVID -19.\" c. The exception here is the 'oldest' reputable definition from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which defines the Post -COVID conditions as \"signs and symptoms that develop during or after an infection consistent with COVID -19, continue for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by an alter native diagnosis.\" While \"Post -COVID syndrome\" has some consistency in use, there has been critique of term \"syndrome\" as inaccurate. \"Post -COVID conditions\" has consistent definitions similar to \"Post - COVID syndrome\" but less critique with the diversity of symptoms captured in the plural form of condition, and the terminology as having a more accurate connotation for this emerging illness. In the face of no international consensus, the use of \"post -COVID conditions\" over the ome\" or \"Long COVID\" is being touted as the interim solution by the Centres for Disease Control 2 and the Public Health Agency of Canada.3 There is insufficient consistency in the evidence base to definitively suggest permanent terminology and definitions should be used in Alberta. The upcoming international consensus work will be most informative. In the meantime, and in the remainder of this report, we use the term \"post -COVID conditions \" because of its relatively consistent definition, and its encompassi ng both \"post -acute\" and \"chronic\" time periods in the trajectory of these conditions . Because this condition is seen in those who are hospitalized and not hospitalized, it is recommended that the \"clock start\" in the definition at the time of diagnosis (or at start of symptoms if a diagnosis date is unavailable). In the future, if a health system were to make determinations on service availability based on time periods (e.g. 4 -12 weeks or 12+ weeks) then qualifiers such as \"post -acute\" or \"chronic\" be used, as consistent with the literature.

Evidence from secondary and grey literature No secondary or grey literature was identified that addressed this question. The literature review for this question on validated screening or assessment tools is limited to primary literature or original research (including preprints). Evidence from the primary literature This synthesis is based on 10 primary literature articles (3 preprints, 7 peer -reviewed articles). The methodologies varied across the studies include observational cohorts (n=4), cross - sectional survey (n=2), review (n=2) and other (n=2) . The research originated from the UK (n=4), as well as one study each from France, Germany, Russia, Spain, the Netherlands, and the USA. Table 1A overviews the key takeaways from these articles as relating to the availability, use and validation of screening or assessment tools for post-COVID conditions , while Table 6A in the Appendix contains the details information extracted from each article. As demonstrated by this synthesis, the evidence on psychometric validation of screening tools is quite limited. We used the adapted MMAT to assess the quality of the article as whole, and not specifically its approach to screening tool validation (Hong et al., 2018). On the whole, the quality of these articles was high, with seven articles being high quality (Arnold et al., 2021; D'Cruz et al., 2021; Lemh\u00f6fer quality (Postigo -Martin et al., 2021) , and 2 of low (Parkin et al., 2021; Vehar et al., 2021) . Synthesis of the Information Relating to Question 1a Approaches to use and validation of screening /assessment tools varies. The 10 included articles describe 13 distinct tools. Only two tools are mentioned more than once. All tools appeared more geared to assessment of patients who had COVID -19 rather than screening the general or COVID -19 populaces. First, the Short -Form -36 (SF- 36) is a validated quality of life tool which is used independently (Arnold et al., 2021) or incorporated into a novel tool (C19- RehabNeS) (Lemh\u00f6fer et al., 2021) . Second, the Post COVID Functional Status (PCFS) Scale is mentioned in 3 studies: (1) where it is tested for psychometric validity (Machado et al., 2021) ; (2) where it is used but not psychometrically tested (D'Cr uz et al., 2021) ; and (3) where i t is mentioned but considered not validated and not used (Vehar et al., 2021) . Four studies proposed the use of (or used) a suite of validated tools, which would cover the myriad potential symptoms and sequelae associated with post -COVID conditions (Arnold et al., 2021; O'Sullivan, 2021; al., 2021; Vehar et al., 2021) . The included tools often cover quality of life, functioning, cognition, fatigue and mental health. Novel tools introduced in these articles as COVID -19-specific assessment tools include: C19-RehabNeS (Lemh\u00f6fer et al., revised: July 12 , 2021 ISARIC COVID -19 Health and Wellbeing Follow Up Survey for Children (Osmanov et al., 2021) Covid 19 Yorkshire Rehab Screen (C19- YRS) (Parkin et al., 2021) Long COVID Symptom Tool (ST) and Long COVID Impact Tool (Tran et al., 2021) Each tool aims to be comprehensive to cover the breadth and diversity of symptoms and functional impacts of post -COVID conditions . The C19- RehabNeS and ISARIC COVID -19 Health and Wellbeing Follow Up Survey for C hildren are presented and used, without any discussion or information on validity. The C19 -YRS is described as recommended across the UK's National Health Service for outcome measurement for post-COVID clinics (Parkin et al., 2021) . It is currently undergoing psychometric testing for construct validity, responsiveness and stability (Parkin et al., 2021) . Only two papers attempted (albeit initial) psychometric testing of two different tools. First, Machado et al (2021) (n=1939) investigated only construct validity of the PCFS comparing it to validated tools measuring quality of life (EQ -5D-5L), and work productivity (WPAI questionnaire). Re garding quality of life, weak -to-strong statistical associations were found between functional status and all domains of health- related quality of life using the 0.661) (Machado et al., 2021) strongest association found was with the 'usual activities' domain of the 5 -level al., 2021) . The WPAI findings revealed complementarity between gradual increases of activity impairment on the WPAI and decreases in functional status (Machado et al., 2021) . However, the study was described as not having sufficient power to detect these \"small but meaningful\" differences (Machado et al., 2021) . Second, Tran et al (2021) (n=351) described the development of, and examination of the construct validity of, two complementary screening tools: Long COVID Symptom Tool (ST) and Long COVID Impact Tool (IT). Their study demonstrated moderat e or high construct validity given moderate correlations to functional status (ST score rs = - 0.39, p<0.0001; IT score rs = - 0.55, p<0.0001) and perceived health state (MYMOP2 score and ST score moderate correlation at rs = - 0.40, p<0.0001; MYMOP2 score and IT score high correlation at rs = - 0.59, p<0.0001) , and high correlations to quality of life (EQ-5D-5L rs = - 0.59, p<0.0001; and EQ -5D VAS rs = - 0.54, p<0.0001) (Tran et al., 2021). Concerningly , this study used the PCFS Scale to examine construct validi ty around functional status. The reliability of the two Long COVID tools (IT and ST) was strong given the test -retest reliability was high (ICC was 0.89 (95% 0.90 ) (Tran et al., 2021) . In sum, there are myriad approaches to assessing patients to determ ine their experience of post-COVID conditions and potential care needs relating to post-COVID conditions . The PCFS Scale is the most prominently described and used tool, with modest findings relating to its construct validity. No truly validated tool has been identified for evaluation of post-COVID conditions at this point, however this is very likely to be rectified within the next 6 months. Table 1A .

C19- RehabNeQ has 57 items assigned to 7 main categories: Time of infection (1 item) Health problems caused by SARS -CoV-2 (14 items) Treatment (9 items ) Activity and participation (13 items) Quality of life and general health (6 items) Health service provisions (5 items) Personal information (9 items) (Machado et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed article The Netherlands Cross -sectional Survey Post -COVID Functional Status (PCFS) Scale Description: The scale was designed to cover the entire range of functional limitations from: grade 0, \"No functional limitations\" to grade 4, \"Severe functional limitations\" and grade 5, \"Death\". The PCFS Scale stratification is composed of five scale grades: grade 0 (No functional limitations); grade 1 (Negligible functional limitations); grade 2 (Slight functional limitations); grade 3 (Moderate functional limitations) grade 4 (Severe functional limitations). The final scale grade 5 'death', which is required to be able to use the scale as outcome measure in clinical trials, was left out for self -administered contexts.

The latter section includes reliable tools for making neces sary assessments, cut -off points and orientation regarding treatment. Specific assessments are categorized as cardiopumonary, neuromuscular system and mental health (Tran et al., 2021) Preprint France Cross sectional survey Two tools: Long COVID Symptom Tool (ST) and Long COVID Impact Tool Description: Long COVID ST score reports the number of symptoms patients experienced over the last 30 days and has a theoretical range from 0 (no symptoms) to 53 (all symptoms identified during step 1). Long COVID IT score has a theoretical range of 0 (no impact) to 60 (maximum impact) and represents the sum of item scores for the 6 questions related to the disease's impact on their personal activities, family lives, professional lives, social lives, their morale, and their rela tionships with care providers. Paper is dedicated to development and validation of construct validity and reliability of the two tools (n=351) . Qualitative patient work informed development . The long COVID ST and IT scores were highly correlated (rs=0.54, p<0.0001) and did not seem to differ by time from symptom onset . In sum, examinations of construct validity demonstrated moderate or high correlations with patients' quality of life, functional status, and perceived health state. Reliability was strong wit h an ICC 0.8 during the test -retest.

Authors discussed PCFS, but felt that \" it has not been validated or widely implemented .\" Research Question 2 (Symptomatology) : After a diagnosis of COVID -19, which symptoms (physical and/or neuropsychiatric) are commonly noted to persist for at least 30 days after acute infection in children and adults? The search strategy and literature review methods described in this review applied to all questions except for this one. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) was completing a living systematic review at the time of preparation of this Scientific Advisory Group Rapid Review. To avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts, i t was determined that for this question on common symptomatology of post -COVID conditions , this review would summarize the PHAC review only. The PHAC used a search strategy developed by the UK National Institute for Heal th and Care Excellence, and it was updated to search for new research published between October 2020 and January 15, 2021. The databases searched included Embase, M edline, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Central. Technically, this review is less up- to-date and covers different databases than the search strategy (PHAC did not include preprints) described herein. The living systematic review sought similar observational studies (n50) capable of meta -analysis, which was not a limitation in the review directed by the S cientific Advisory Group. The latter was more inclusive and heterogeneous compared to the former. Nevertheless, the strategies are comparable and both reputable. W ith recognition of these differences, the remainder of this section summarizes the key findin gs from the PHAC living systematic review. The PHAC review used the term \"post COVID -19 conditions\" for persistent or recurring symptoms at 4-12 and > 12 weeks. The PHAC review can be found at https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.03.21258317v1. Evidence from secondary and grey literature There was no secondary or grey literature included in this review. Evidence from the primary literature Of the 2807 unique citations, 36 observational studies met the inclusion criteria (after independent review by two screeners) : 28 studies included prevalence data for individuals with laboratory -confirmed COVID -19 and 8 included prevalence data for individuals who were clinically -diagnosed with COVID -19. The PHAC review focused on the 28 laboratory -confirmed studies for their synthesis. The synthesis and findings provided by PHAC did not distinguish hospitalized versus non- hospitalized patients. All studies were observational (cohort or cross -sectional), with samples sizes between 58 and 1733 individuals; most studies had n<200 (n=21 of 28). The majority were conducted in Europe (n=16), with the remaining in Asia (n=6), North America (n=3, 1 of which was from Canada) and 25 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 other s (3). Most articles recruited adults only (n=17), while a minority did not restrict recruitment by age (n=10). Only 1 study focused on a pediatric population. Forty -three percent of studies (n=12) only recruited participants who were hospitalized or admit ted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to COVID -19. Seventy -nine percent (n=22) of studies measured short -term outcomes (i.e., between 4- 12 weeks from COVID -19 diagnosis) and 21% (n=6) measured outcomes beyond 12 weeks (5/6 measured outcomes up to 6 mont hs). Quality -wise, all studies of laboratory -confirmed COVID -19 had moderate to high risk of bias: 19 studies were at moderate risk of bias and the other 9 at high risk of bias using the GRADE tool. The most common sources of potential bias were participant selection (i.e. convenience samples or study population was not representative of the target population) and poor objectivity/validity of outcome measurement (i.e. many outcomes were self -reported or obtained using non -validated measures). Synthesis of the Information Relating to Question 2 The PHAC review sought to clarify the prevalence of post COVID syndrome (terminology used in the review) , including the frequency of symptoms, sequelae and impairments to daily living. Over 100 post COVID -19 conditions were reported in laboratory -confirmed individuals. Eighty - three percent (95%CI: very low certainty ) reported persistence or presence of one or more symptoms in the short - and long- term, respectively. The most prevalent symptoms in both periods included: fatigue, general pain or discomfort, sleep disturbances, shortness of breath and anxiety or depressi on (point estimates ranging from 22- 51%; low to very low certainty ). Table 2 presents the most prevalent symptoms and frequencies as described in the PHAC review. The PHAC interpreted their results as follows: \" data indicate that a substantial proportion of individuals reported a variety of symptoms 4 weeks after COVID -19 diagnosis. Due to low certainty in the evidence, further research is needed to determine the true burden of post COVID -19 conditions.\" The PHAC recognized some evidence gaps and limits t o their living systematic review. Most studies included adults or persons hospitalized or treated for moderate- to-severe COVID -19. The prevalence of post COVID syndrome in children, asymptomatic individuals, and those with mild COVID -19 (i.e. community onl y) may not be sufficiently represented in the results. Few studies reported beyond 12 weeks post -infection. Most studies had small sample sizes (< 200 participants) or were at risk of bias due to participant recruitment methods and outcome measures used. M ost studies lack contemporaneous control groups, so causation is difficult and confounding likely. Possible contributing factors include presence of pre -existing symptoms or conditions prior to COVID -19, treatment effects, impact of hospitalization or ICU admission, and the effects of the novel, global pandemic itself (e.g. barriers to care, psychosocial impacts). Table 2. Key Symptom Prevalence Findings for Post COVID Syndrome (per PHAC Living Systematic Review) in hospitalized adults with confirmed COVID -19 Data note: These results have very low or low certainty due to the low quality of available evidence, which was predominantly (not exclusively) from observational studies of hospitalized and critical care bas ed 26 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 populations with confirmed COVID -19, with all studies at graded at moderate to high risk of bias. Therefore, these results should not be extrapolated to outpatient populations ; there findings have more generalizability to hospitalized patients . Time Fra me Prevalent Symptoms Short -Term (4 -12 weeks after COVID -19 diagnosis) Approximately 4 in 5 individuals (83%, 95% CI: 65 -93%, low certainty ) reported the persistence or presence of one or more symptoms in the short -term primarily after hospitalization for COVID - 19. The most prevalent symptoms in the short -term were: Fatigue (51%, 95% CI: 39- 35- 68%, low certainty ) reported feeling ill or not back to full heal th in the short -term. Long -Term (>12 weeks after COVID -19 diagnosis) Approximately 3 in 5 individuals (56%, 95% CI: 34 -75%, very low certainty ) reported persistence or presence of one or more symptoms in the long- term primarily after hospitalization for C OVID - 19. The most prevalent symptoms Fatigue (47%, 95% CI: 27- 68%, very Anxiety (22- 23%, low to very low certainty ) Depression or post -traumatic stress disorder (22- 23%, low to very low certainty ) Shortness of breath (22- 23%, low to very low certainty ) Hair fall/loss (22- 23%, low to very low certainty ) The most prevalent complication from acute COVID -19 was unresolved impaired pulmonary function (42%, 95%CI: 25- 29%, very low certainty ). Research Question 3 (Risk Factors) : Which patients with COVID -19 are at highest risk of developing these chronic symptoms? Is the severity of COVID -19 disease (e.g. hospitalized; ICU) associated with the probability of developing post -acute COVID symptoms? Evidence from secondary and grey literature Six grey literature articles spoke on the topic of risk factors, and were included by two independent reviewers for this analysis. These articles came from reputable organizations in Belgium (Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre), Canada (e.g. Public Health Ontario, Ministry of Ontario), Norway (Norwegian Institute of Public Health), and the World Health Organization. Evidence from the primary literature During t he article screening process, 39 articles were included according to the established inclusion criteria (27 peer -reviewed, 5 preprint, in addition to the 6 grey literature articles described above). The study designs of these 38 articles include observational cohort (n=22), cross sectional survey (n=7), review (n=8) and systematic review (n=2). 27 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 These articles originated from across the globe: UK (n=8 ), USA (n=6), Spain (n=5), Canada (n=3, all reviews), China (n=3), Norway (n=3), and 1 each from Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Korea, Malaysia, Romania, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, and The Netherlands. For the empirical studies, the median (minimum, maximum) sample size was 402 (10, 236,379). The mean (standard deviation) and median follow -up period for the empirical studies were 15.8 (9.7) and 12, respectively. Using the below described adapted MMAT on the 38 included references (Hong et al., 2018), 28 articles were considered high quality (Al-Aly et al., 2020; Ayoubkhani et al., 2021; Banerjee et al., 2021; al., 2021; Castro et al., 2020; D'Cruz et al., 2021; -Romieu et al., et al., 2021; 2021; al., 2021; Vanichkachorn et al., 2021; Whittaker et al., 2021; Yong, 2020) , 3 considered moderate quality, and 8 considered low quality. Common limitations of the empirical studies were that the recruitment techniques did not favour generalizability, concerns on recall and selection bias, and for some studies the sample sizes queried the accuracy of the statistical significance proclaimed. For extraction, the writers and reviewer s of this rapid review determined to include the review and systematic review articles as references, but they were not extracted or included as part of the synthesis. It should be noted, that we used the studies description to inform study design determination. Several observational cohorts on closer examination fell more in line with a cross sectional survey design, which some authors noted in their limitations section. Nevertheless, the extracted details are provided in full in the Appendix (Table 6B ). In this section, Table 3A provides summaries of the studies that focused hospitalized patients (n=15 studies) and Table 3B summarizes the studies that focused on all types of COVID -19 patients (hospitalized and community -only experience) (n=24). It appears that no studies limited their examination to community -only experiences of COVID -19. Synthesis of the Information Relating to Question 3 Studies Involving Only Patients Previously Hospitalized for COVID -19 Fourteen studies looked at the chronic symptoms or manifestation of post -COVID conditions in patients who had been hospitalized for COVID -19; these cases involved primarily laboratory - confirmed diagnoses and used either administrative data or observation surveys (Table 3A). None of these studies used social media. Table 3C highlights the recognized risk factors from these studies. The most commonly recognized risk factors that have statistically significant associations with post -COVID conditions include older age (at least >60 years) (n=5 studies); bei ng female (n=4 studies); and, presence of co- morbidities (including COPD, diabetes, heart failure and chronic kidney disease) (n=3 studies). Other noted risk factors by two studies each included White ethnicity, ICU admission, oxygen delivery in hospital, and being male. The male risk factor was associated with increased risk of post -traumatic stress disorder and risk of re- hospitalization. One study each noted risk factors associated with peri -acute manifestations: multiple symptoms in the acute infection, physical symptoms at discharge, and more than 2 emergency department visits up to 2 months before the acute infection. Of all the included studies, only one focused exclusively on pediatric populations (Osmanov et al., 2021). Osmanov et al (2021) found t hat in pediatric populations, risk factors for post -COVID conditions include older age (12 - 18 years old) and allergic disease. There must be caution taken in interpreting the \"female\" and \"male\" risk factor, as the studies varied widely on whether they w ere capturing a gender identity variable or a physiological sex 28 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 variable; and on whether this information was captured through self -report or health team interpretation. Importantly, two studies of high quality according to the adapted MMAT found no risk factors were statistically associated with post -COVID conditions (Fernandez -de-Las-Penas et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2021). Studies Involving Both Hospitalized and Non- Hospitalized Patients with COVID -19 The remaining 23 studies touched on all types of C OVID -19 patients, including those who had been hospitalized and/or non- hospitalized patients. Ten articles were review articles that were not directly extracted. Of the 13 articles, there was varying methodology with use of administrative data, cross - sectional surveys, or examination of social media application communities. Table 3D highlights the recognized risk factors from these studies. The most commonly recognized risk factors that have statistically significant associations with post -COVID conditions include older age (n=4 studies); multiple symptoms at acute infection (n=4 studies); studies); hospitalization (n=3 studies); and, presence of co- morbidities (n=2 studies). These risk factors do corroborate t hose found in the hospitalized- only populations. However, the age threshold for \"older age\" is not as clearly defined for the diverse populations in these studies. Three studies describe the risky age group as over 70, 54 -64, and 40 -59 each. Also, as descr ibed above, female as an age or gender is not clearly or consistently defined to inform interpretation. Twelve further, unique risk factors were noted by one study each (Table 3D). These generally related to some symptoms noted during the acute infection period: diarrhea, aguesia, anosomia, low baseline SARS -CoV-2 levels, no headache, and developing encephalopathy. Importantly, two studies of high quality according to the adapted MMAT found no risk factors were statistically associated with post -COVID conditions (Einvik et al., 2021; Moreno- Perez et al., 2021). The body of literature on risk factors for COVID -19 has evolved and strengthened since the first SAG review on the topic of chronic sy mptoms and risk factors post -acute COVID -19 (dated November 30, 2020). In the first review, four articles highlighted 3 risk factors: younger age, female, and previous diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder. With 28 empirical articles (not including the 9 rev iews and 1 n=10 study) , there is stronger, more corroborated evidence on at least some of the factors that may increase the likelihood of experiencing post -COVID conditions . The new batch of articles do not speak to mental health symptoms as much as the fi rst review's included articles. However, it appears that older age (not younger age) is the age- related risk factor; in this way, this new review refutes the previous set of evidence. This updated review points to several key risk factors: older age, being female, severity of acute infection (whether by requiring hospitalization, ICU admission, oxygen as well as by presenting with multiple symptoms), and the presence of co- morbidities (particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)). Table 3A. S ummary of Studies assessing risks for morbidity after COVID -19 hospitalization. Author Study Details (Article Type, Country, Study Design) Noted Risk Factors 29 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 (Ayoubkhani et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed UK Observational cohort Hospitalized COVID -19 patients, lab confirmed Admin data N=47,780 Aim: Estimate excess morbidity after severe COVID -19 (hospitalized) using administrative data (retrospective, matched cohort study) Mean follow -up 20 weeks RISK FACTORS: Rates of all outcomes (e.g. death, readmission, respiratory disease, chronic kidney or liver disease) after discharge were greater in individuals with COV ID- 19 aged 70 or more than in those aged less than 70 Rates of all outcomes (e.g. death, readmission, respiratory disease, chronic kidney or liver disease) other than diabetes were greater in the white ethnic group than in the non- white group. Rate ratios comparing patients with COVID -19 and matched controls were greater in individuals aged less than 70 than those aged 70 or more for all outcomes, however. The largest differences in rate ratios were for death (14.1 (95% confidence interval 11.0 to 18.3) for age <70 years v 7.7 (7.1 to 8.3) for 70) and respiratory disease (10.5 (9.7 to 11.4) for age <70 v 4.6 (4.3 to 4.8) for 70). Ethnic differences in rate ratios were greatest for respiratory disease (11.4 (9.8 to 13.3) for individuals in the non- white g roup v 5.2 (5.0 to 5.5) in the white ethnic group). Differences in rate ratios between men and women were general ly small . NOTE: focus on severe COVID -19, so likely many syndromes (e.g. post -ICU syndrome) implicated in post - discharge health service use. (Bellan et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed Italy Observational cohort Hospitalized COVID -19 patients, lab confirmed N=238 Aim: evaluate the prevalence of lung function anomalies, exercise function impairment, and psychological sequelae among patients hospitalized for COVID -19, 4 months after discharge. RISK FACTORS: In logistic regression analysis, risk factors associated with D LCO less than 8 0% of expected (pulmonary function) at follow -up included female sex (odds ratio [OR], 4.33 [95% CI, 2.25 -8.33]; P<.001), [95% CI, 2.00- 51.05]; P=.005), and the modality of oxygen delivery during hospital stay (OR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.08- 2.61]; P=.02). Risk factors associated with D LCO less than 60% at follow -up were female sex (OR, [95% CI, 1.37- 24.25]; P=.02) COPD was associated with an increased risk physical impairment (OR, 12.70 [95% CI, 1.41- 114.85]; P=.02), and higher D LCO was associated with decreased risk of physical impairment (OR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.94 -0.98]; P<.001 ). 30 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Authors describe male sex was the only factor independently associated with the presence of moderate to severe post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (but in supplemental, the p=0.20). (Bowles et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed USA Observational cohort Hospitalized COVID -19 patients N=1,409 Aim: To describe the home health recovery of patients with COVID -19 and risk factors associated with re- hospitalization or death Mean follow -up 12 weeks RISK FACTORS Risk for re -hospitalizat ion or death was higher among male patients (HR, 1.45 [CI, 1.04 to 2.03]); White patients (HR, 1.74 [CI, 1.22 to 2.47]); and patients who had heart fail ure (HR, 2.12 [CI, 1.41 to 3.19]), diabetes with complications (HR, 1.71 [CI, 1.17 to 2.52]), 2 or more emergency department visits in the past 6 months (HR, 1.78 [CI, 1.21 to 2.62]) (D'Cruz et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed UK Observational cohort Hospitalized COVID -19 patients N=119 Prospective, single- centre observational cohort Follow -up 7- 9 weeks post -discharge follow -up Population: adults discharged after severe COVID -19 pneumonia (hospitalization 48hrs) RISK FACTORS: Comorbid obstructive lung disease was associated with failure of mMRC recovery to baseline (OR 5.06, 95% CI 1.01 -7.98; p=0.047) Pre-morbid obstructive lung disease was associated with persistent (NRS 1) breathlessness (OR 8.04, 95% CI 0.19 cough 3.43, 0.98 -12.0), burdensome (NRS cough (OR 1.97, 95% CI OR 2.27, 95% CI 0.38- 13.69; p=0.37, respectively). There were no associations between the presence or absence of pre -existing comorbidities and persistent fatigue, sleep disturbance or pain. Ordinal logistic regression modelling was performed for the outcomes of return of mMRC grade to pre- COVID - 19 baseline, PCFS grade 2, positive mental health screening ( PHQ -9 or GAD -7 >9 or Trauma oxygen desaturation 4% on STS) (table 3). Positive associations were found between PCFS grade 2, physio logical impairment (4MGS <0.8 m\u00b7s1 and STS repetitions <2.5th percentile) and positive mental health screening. Critical care admission and need for IMV were associated with physiological functional impairment. Neither worst inpatient nor follow -up RALE s core were associated with any modelled outcome measure. LIMITS: not possible to do lung function on serial patients; conventional walking tests impractical; lack of standardized definition of post -COVID conditions; single centre 31 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 (Ekbom et al., 2021) Peer -review ed Sweden Observational cohort Hospitalized COVID -19 patients N=60 Aim: prevalence of respiratory impairment as measured by pulmonary function tests (PFT) and associated factors in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) -treated COVID -19 patients 3 -6 months after discharge. RISK FACTORS The most common impairment is reduced diffusing capacity, present in 45%. This risk increases with age above 60, need for mechanical ventilation and time in ICU . Longer stay in the ICU as well as impaired FVC (<LLN) at follow -up were also associated with impaired DLCO. All these significant relations could be confirmed after further adjusting for age. LIMITS: small sample size, no control, selection bias (Fern\u00e1ndez -de- Las-Pe\u00f1as et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed Spain Observational cohort Hospitalized COVID -19 patients N=1,950 Population: Adults hospitalized with COVID -19 in first wave of 3 hospitals in Spain Follow -up average 44.8 weeks RISK FACTORS for post -COVID cough: None found LIMITS: phone survey; no community -only perspectives; no data on diagnostics or severity; cross -sectional data (Islam et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed UK Observational cohort Hospitalized COVID -19 patients N=403 Population: Patients discharged during 4 month period from NHS Follow -up average 8.6 weeks RISK FACTORS The standardized incidence rate (per 100 person-months) of readmission or death within 60 days of discharge was twice as high among those aged 65 years as those < 65 years [23.4 vs 10.6; standardized incidence rate ratio 2.21 (95% CI: 1.45 -3.56)] and among women as men [34.9 vs 15.5; standardized incidence rate ratio 2.25 (1.05- 4.18)]. There was no evidence of vari ation in incidence by ethnicity . LIMITS : limited generalizability (1 region, limited diversity) (Lerum et al., 2020) Peer -reviewed Norway Observational cohort Hospitalized COVID -19 patients N=103 Aim describe symptoms and pulmonary function 3- months following hospital admission for COVID -19 Follow -up average 11.8 weeks for COVID -19 or viral pneumonia RISK FACTORS: Age per year NOT associated with dyspnea (OR 0.81, p=0.231). Age per year associated with ground glass opacities ( GGO) in chest CT (OR 1.81, p=0.004). Age per year NOT associated with parenchymal bands in chest CT (OR 1.19, p =0.376) . LIMITS: possible participation bias STRENGTHS: multicenter, prospective design; age and prevale nce similar between sample and population estimates; dyspnea is subjective so valuable to have diagnostic imaging. 32 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 (Liang et al., 2020) Peer -reviewed China Observational cohort Hospitalized COVID -19 patients N=67 Aim: to evaluate symptoms and lung function of COVID -19 survivors post -discharge Follow -up 12 weeks RISK FACTORS: None found LIMITS: small sample; single site; large decline rate so selection bias; some patients had no prior medical history so unclear if pre -existing or novel diagnoses (Mei et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed China Cross sectional survey Hospitalized COVID -19 patients N=3,677 AIM: to record and investigate possible post -COVID -19 sequelae and herd immunity Follow -up average 20.6 weeks RISK FACTORS: The incidence of post -COVID -19 sequelae among elderly COVID -19 survivors ( age 60 years) was slightly increased compared to that of young COVID -19 survivors (age <60 years; relative risk = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02-1.10, p = 0.007). LIMITS: no control; not designed to determine impact of treatment (Osmanov et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed Russia Observational cohort PEDIATRIC Hospitalized COVID -19 patients N=518 Population: children previously hospitali zed with Covid -19, Single survey, follow -up average 36 weeks, \u00bc had symptoms, at >6months 9% had fatigue, 6 % sleep issues, 5% disturbed sense of smell RISK FACTORS: Age & Allergic disease: In multivariable regression analysis, older age group was associated with persistent symptoms. When compared with children under two years of ages, those ages 6- 11 years had an odds ratio of 2.74 (95% confidence interval 1.37 to 5.75) of persistent sympto ms and those 342 12- 18 years of age (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.41 to 5.4) both vs. <2 years. Another predictor associated with persistent symptoms was allergic diseases (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.67). Similar patterns were seen for children with co- existence of persistent symptoms from 2 or more categories: 6- 11 years of age (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.02 to 6.72), 12- 18 years of age (OR3.18, 95% CI 1.43 to 8.11) both vs. <2 years. Allergic disease in children were also associated with a higher risk of long COVID (Park et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed Korea Cross sectional survey Hospitalized COVID -19 patients N=10 Aim: to assess mental health in patients with COVID -19 Population: 10 patients recovering from COVID -19 pneumonia after discharge Follow -up 4 weeks LIMITS: Too sm all of a sample to appropriately perform any quantitative analyses. Due to size of sample, not including in synthesis above. (Qu et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed China Observational cohort N=540 Population: COVID -19 patients who had been discharged from designated hospitals Follow -up average 12 weeks 33 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Hospitalized COVID -19 patients RISK FACTORS Results of logistic regression showed that female (odds ratio (OR): 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-3.06), older age (60 years) (OR: 2.44, 95% CI: 95% CI: 9.68- 166.49) were risk factors for poor physical component summary; the physical symptom after discharge (OR: 6.68, 95% CI: 4.21-10.59) was a risk factor for poor mental component summary. LIMITS: confounding factors; reliability of SF -36 is low in study; design is cohort but implementation like cross - sectional survey so difficult to make causal inferences. (Sigfrid et al., 2021) Preprint UK Observational cohort Hospitalized COVID -19 patients N=327 Population: adults, admitted to hospital during study period with suspected COVID -19 and discharged at least 90 days previous Follow -up average 31.7 weeks. RISK FACTORS Females under the age of 50 y ears were five times less likely to report feeling recovered (adjusted OR 5.09, 95% CI 1.64 to 15.74), were more likely to have greater disability (adjusted OR 4.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 15.94), twice as likely to report worse fatigue (adjusted OR 2.06, 95% CI 0 .81 to 3.31) and seven times more likely to become more breathless (adjusted OR 7.15, 95% CI 2.24 to 22.83) than men of the same age. LIMITS: not generalizable; selection bias; design is cohort but implementation like cross -sectional survey so difficult to make causal inferences. (Tudoran et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed Romania Cross sectional survey Hospitalized COVID -19 patients N=125 Population: aged under 55 years; patients hospitalized during the first COVID -19 outbreak for a mild/moderate form; confirmed COVID -19 diagnosis Follow -up average 8 weeks RISK FACTORS age and BMI (r = 0.81 and r = 0.67, p < 0.001) correlated with COVID TCT score (r = 0.79, p < 0.001) . LIMITS: Hospitalized so not generalizable to general population. Results very specific to physiological functioning versus patient experience of symptoms, which is what primarily discussed in post COVID syndrome. Other studies have noted that physiological functioning does not predict symptomatology in post -COVID conditions. Table 3B. Summary of Key Details from Included Articles on Risk Factors Associated from Studies Including All Types of COVID -19 Patients (Hospitalized & Non- Hospitalized) Author Study Details (Article Type, Country, Study Design) Noted Risk Factors 34 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 (Augustin et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed Germany Observational cohort All types of COVID -19 patients N=958 Aim: explore the incidence, diagnostic criteria and management of long- term health consequences at 4 and 7 months after mild courses of COVID -19 at post -COVID outpatient clinic Mean 22 weeks follow -up (2 follow -ups at 4 and 7 months) RISK FACTORS: Used univariate logi stic regression revealed several factors and symptoms during acute COVID -19 that were associated with an increased risk of post COVID syndrome after 7 months. Multiple symptoms (2+) (odds ratio (OR) 1.28; 95% confidence (OR 95% CI 1.19- 3.53) Male gender was as sociated with a lower risk for post COVID syndrome (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.31- 0.77). In the multivariable logistic regression model a lower baseline level of SARS -CoV-2 was associated with a higher risk of developing post -COVID conditions after 7 months IgG (initial IgG diarrhea during acute COVID -19 were independent predictors for a PCS after 7 months with an OR of 5.12 (95% CI 2.43- 10.76, p=<0.001) and respectively . (Caronna et al., 2020) Peer -reviewed cohort Sub- population; unclear re: hospitalization N=130 Aim: To define headache characteristics and evolution in relation to COVID -19 and its inflammatory response Mean follow -up 6 weeks RISK FACTORS For patients with and without headache, for whom data were available at follow -up, and adjusting for age and gender, we observed shorter COVID -19 disease duration in the headache group (23.9 and 11.6 vs. 31.2 and 12.0 days; p= 0.028). We did not observe any difference in mortality (no mortality in this subgroup) or hospital length of stay (9.1 and 9.0 vs. 10.9 and 9.0 days; p= 0.854). LIMITS: patients had confirmed -19 diagnosis; single centre; one symptom of focus (Demelo - Rodr\u00edgu ez et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed Spain Observational cohort All types of COVID -19 patients N=100 Aim: describe the long- term outcomes of COVID -19 patients with VTE and to analyze the risk factors of poor prognosis. Mean follow -up 13.9 weeks RISK FACTORS: Development of main outcome (death) was significantly associated with ICU admission (OR 8.437, p<0.001), 35 Last revised: cancer (OR 7.187, p0.024). Risk of death or major bleeding was independently associa ted with ICU admission (HR 12.2; 95% thrombocytopenia 21.6; 95% CI 1.8- 259) LIMITS: Describes r isk factors for negative outcomes from COVID -19 and VTE, not other forms of post -COVID conditions. More about complication of COVID -19 vs. \"long COVID.\" (Einvik et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed Norway Cross sectional survey All types of COVID -19 patients N=583 Aim: Determine if prevalence of symptom -defined PTSD 1.5-6 months after COVID -19 was higher in hospitalized than non- hospitalized subjects; and, determine risk factors for persistent symptoms of PTSD in COVID -19 survivors Population: 17% Norwegian population (subjects of 2 parallel cohort studies); adults with positive COVID test Follow -up: 4- 8 weeks post -discharge or 1- 4 months post - diagnosis for non- hospitalized RISK FACTORS: none found (Himmels, 2021) Grey Literature Norway Review All types of COVID -19 patients Review ( n=43 articles) Exact studies and findings not extracted. (Hirschtick et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed USA Cross sectional survey All types of COVID -19 patients N=593 Aim: to estimate the prevalence and correlates of post - acute sequelae of SARS -CoV-2 infection (PASC). Follow -up average 8.6 weeks RISK FACTORS Respondents reporting very severe (vs. mild) symptoms had 2.25 times higher prevalence of 30- day COVID -19 ([aPR] 2.25, 95% CI 1.46- 3.46) and 1.71 times higher prevalence of 60- day COVID -19 (aPR 1.71, 95% 1.02- 2.88). Hospitalized (vs. non- hospitalized) respondents had about 40% higher prevalence of both 30- day (aPR 1.37, 95% CI 1.12- 1.69) and 60- day COVID -19 (aPR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02- 1.93). In unadjusted analyses, older age was statistically significantly associated with 30- day and 60- day COVID -19 prevalence. Respondents aged 55- 64 years had 1.71 times higher prevalence of 30- day COVID -19 (Prevalence Ratio [PR] 1.71, 95% CI 1.19- 2.47) and 2.14 times higher prevalence of 60- day COVID -19 (PR 2.14, 95% CI 1.27- 3.59) relative to 18- 34 year -olds. Annual household income was a strong and significant predictor of 30- day COVID -19. Even after adjusting for demographic and clinical factors, respondents with an income less than $75,000 had about 40% higher prevalence of 30- day COVID -19 than respondents with an income at or above aPR 1.09 -1.75). was not 36 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 significantly associated with 60 -day COVID -19 in fully adjusted models.

Subjects with severe functional limitations (Grade 4 on the PCFS Scale) presented lower BMI compar ed to all other groups . Other factors associated with poorer functional st atus were marital status (prevalence of category 'alone' highest in Grade 4) and presence of comorbidities (prevalence of '2 comorbidities' highest in Grade 4).

Offers some insight on risk factors for healthcare usage. RISK FACTORS: In multivariable analyses among initially symptomatic partici pants, we found evidence that severe to very severe symptoms during acute illness (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.34, p=0.003) and the presence of comorbidities (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.50, p=0.005) were associated with higher odds of not having recovered. Females were less likely to have recovered at 6- 8 months after diagnosis compared to males (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.85, p=0.009) DYSPNEA: In multivariable analyses, we found evidence for an association of grade 1 dyspnea with female sex (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.87, p=0.003), initial hospitalization (OR 4.17, 95% CI 2.23 to 7.91, 37 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 p<0.001) and body mass index (OR 1.14 per unit increase, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.20, p<0.001), but not with age, initial symptom severity, smoking or respiratory como rbidity LIMITS: testing capacity early in pandemic might mean more severely -affected population; risk of self -selection bias; lack of baseline; not all health service utilization (i.e. no specialty use or diagnostic services); (Mermelstein et al., 2021) Preprint USA Cross sectional survey All types of COVID -19 patients N=401 Population: Adults, self -identify as Hispanic/Latinx and Black Follow -up average 16 weeks RISK FACTORS In a multivariable logistic regression model, older age (40-59 vs. 18- 39 years: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.46 [95% confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.90]) and having been hospitalized with COVID -19 (vs. not hospitalized: aOR = 0.28 [0.12 to 0.64]) were independently associated with a lower likelihood of recovery within 3 months. A similar pattern was noted in participants who were age 60 years and older vs. age 18- 39 years, though differences were not significant. Participants who were hospitalized with COVID -19 were significantly less likely to return to usual health within 3 months (vs. not hospitalized: aOR 0.28, 95% CI COVID -19 positivity; no population- based sampling strategy and short window to participate so limited generalizability; (Moreno -P\u00e9rez et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed Spain Observational cohort All types of COVID -19 patients N=277 Aim: to analyze the incidence of Post -acute COVID -19 syndrome (PCS) and its components, and to evaluate the acute infection phase associated risk factors.

This strong risk factor was predictive in both sexes and in all age groups. The five symptoms experienced during the first week that were most predictive of LC28 in the individuals with COVID - 19 were: fatigue (OR 2.83 (CI 2.09 -3.83)), headache (OR 2.62 (2.04 -3.37)), dyspnea (OR 2.36 (CI 1.91 - 2.91), hoarse voice (OR 2.33 (1.88- 2.90)) and myalgi a (OR 2.22 (1.80- 2.73)). Similar patterns were observed in both sexes. In adults aged over 70 years, loss of smell (which was generally less common in this age group) was the most predictive symptom of long COVID (OR 7.35 (CI 1.58-34.22)) before fever (OR 5.51 (CI 1.75- 17.36) and hoarse voice (OR 4.03 (CI 1.21-13.42).

While advanced age and the presence of several comorbidities are positively associated with increased mortality and hospitalization during acute infections, CARP patients were younger (mean age 45.4 years old + 14.2) than groups associated with severe infection, high mortality, and hospitalization. In addition, most PCS patients had no significant medical conditions prior to their SARS -CoV-2 infection, making it difficult to predict which patients may be at risk for PCS.

Evidence from secondary and grey literature No secondary or grey literature was identified that addressed this question. The literature review for this question on vaccination impact is limited to primary literature or original research (includin g preprints). Evidence from the primary literature This synthesis on the impact of vaccination on post -COVID conditions is based on 2 primary articles ( 2 preprints), both using observational cohort designs (Arnold et al., 2021; Raw et al., 2021) . Both articles are from the UK. Table 4 contains the key takeaways from these articles, while detailed information extracted from each articles is found in Table 6C . The body of evidence on vaccination implications for post -COVID conditions is very small and emergin g, given the preprint status of the 2 articles detected. Using the below described adapted MMAT (Hong et al., 2018), both were considered moderate quality (Arnold et al., 2021; Raw et al., 2021). Synthesis of the Information Relating to Question 4 Published, peer -reviewed literature on the implications of vaccination on post-COVID conditions is lacking. Only 2 articles were found that touch upon associations between vaccination and the symptoms of post -COVID conditions (Arnold et al., 2021; Raw et al., 2021) . A single study (n=66) sought to distinguish the symptom burden in post -discharge for COVID -19 (Arnold et al., 2021) . For patients describing post -COVID symptoms, there were small, but statistically significant, increases in symptom resolution (23.2% vaccinated vs. 15.4% unvaccinated) and decreases in worsening symptoms (5.6% vaccinated vs. 14.3% unvaccinated) (p=0.035, each) (Arnold et al., 2021) . Upon vaccination, about 41% of all study participants described transient (< 72 hour duration) systemic effects, often ass ociated with immunization (including fever, myalgia, and headache) (Arnold et al., 2021) . There was no 43 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 significant variation by type of vaccine. Study limitations include recall bias and selection bias in that a vaccinated population may vary in significant ways from unvaccinated persons. As a single study of a small, previously -hospitalized cohort, the generalizability of this study is also questioned. The other study (n=974) took a broader, and different , approach to explore whether previous COVID -19 infection (including those with post -COVID conditions ) is associated with different frequencies of vaccination- related adverse events : myalgia, fever, fatigue , arthralgia, and lymphadenopathy (Raw et al., 2021) . This study focused on health care workers (Raw et al., 2021) . Prior COVID -19 infection, but not post -COVID conditions , is associated with increased risk of vaccination- related adverse events (Raw et al., 2021) . The proportion of participants reporting at least one moderate -to-severe symptom was higher in the pr ior COVID -19 infection group (56% v 47%, Odds Ratio (OR) =1.5 [95%CI, 1.1 -2.0], p=0.009). Confidence that these symptoms were vaccination related lies in the finding that s ymptom onset was mostly within 24 hours (75%) with no onset >48 hours. After controlling for age and sex, higher symptom number (1.61 (2.26) v s 0.89 (2.02) symptoms, d=0.34 [0.20- 0.49], p<0.001) and severity symptom -days, d=0.41 [0.27- 0.55], p<0.001) were significantly reporting previous COVID -19 infection . Symptom number and duration was not significantly higher in those with post -COVID conditions after accounting for gender and age effects and no individual symptom was significantly associated with this condition. Study limitations include recall bias around adverse event and positive COVID -19 status, and non -responder bias. Also, the subset of survey respondents with post -COVID conditions is relatively small, which impacts the insights possible on this specific population. Similar to the other study discussion vaccination in persons who experienced COV ID-19, this is a single study of modest size, specific to health care workers and with limited numbers of patients with post -COVID conditions , so the generalizability of this study is also questioned. Table 4. Summary of Articles Informing Impact of Vaccination Author Study Details (Article Type, Country, Study Design) Implications of Vaccination (Arnold et al., 2021) Prepri nt UK Observational cohort N=66 Population: patients originally hospitalized with COVID -19 at 1 UK hospital Aim: assess change in quality of life and symptoms after vaccination Mean follow -up 32 weeks No significant worsening in quality of life or mental wellbeing metrics pre- vs. post - vaccination. About 41% reported transient (<72 hour duration) systemic effects (including fever, myalgia and headache) When compared to matched unvaccinated participants from the same cohort, those who had received vaccine had a small improvement in Long COVID symptoms, with a decrease in worsening symptoms (5.6% vaccinated vs. 14.3% unvaccinated) and increase in symptom r esolution (23.2% vaccinated vs. 15.4% unvaccinated) (p=0.035). Does not vary with type of vaccine. (Raw et al., 2021) Preprint UK N=974 Population: health care workers receiving first dose of Pfizer vaccine at 3 hospitals 44 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Given the dearth of studies in this area, and that only 1 study truly addresses the question of this review, it is not possible to conclusively determine whether COVID -19 vaccination impacts the course of post-COVID conditions . Conservatively, evidence suggests that patients with post - COVID conditions (a) may experience more peri -immunization adverse events within 24 hours of vaccination, but (b) may experience improvements in the longer -term such as symptom resolution or less worsening of symptoms. The timing, likelihood and nature of such improvements is un clear and requires further rigorous, scientific study. Research Question 5 (Health System Impact) : What are the potential health system impacts and what could be the health care needs for patients with PASC (e.g. emergency department visits, hospital use, home care, rehab, community programs)? Research Question 5a (Health System Impact): Is it anticipated that any increased health system resource use would continue indefinitely (chronic disease model) or would this decrease over time? Evidence from secondary and grey literature Four grey literature documents were identified that addressed these two questions related to health system impact and implications of post-COVID conditions . The documents arise from reputable organizations: the World Health Organization (WHO) (World Health Organization, 2021b) ; and governmental organizations or ministries in Canada (Research, 2021) and the UK (Maxwell, 2020; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, Observational cohort Aim: Determine frequency of adverse events after vaccination for patients with and without previous COVID - 19 infection The proportion of participants reporting at least one moderate- to-severe symptom was higher in the previous COVID -19 group (56% v -2.0], 0.009). Symptom onset was mostly within 24 hours (75%) with no onset >48 hours. After controlling for age and sex, higher symptom number (1.61 (2.26) v 0.89 (2.02) symptoms, d=0.34 [0.20- d=0.41 [0.27- 0.55], p< 0.001) with reporting previous COVID -19. Logistic regressions controlling for age and sex showed five systemic symptoms were significantly associated with previous COVID -19 status: fever ( OR 2.87, p =0.044), 5.18, p =0.033). Symptom number and duration was not significantly higher in those with Long- COVID after accounting for gender and age effects and no individual symptom was significantly associated with this condition. 45 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 from the MMAT quality assessment, these articles , which are all reviews, were ranked of low quality. Evidence from the primary literature Eighteen primary literature articles informed this synthesis (3 preprints, 15 peer -reviewed articles). Most of the primary literature came from the UK (n=8), USA (n=6), and one each from European or Asian countries (Belgium, Denmark, Malaysia, Switzerland). The primary literature included primarily observational cohorts (n=10), as well as cross -sectional surveys (n=2), and 1 each of a review, systematic review, and quality im provement project. Three articles fell into an \"other\" category and were primarily descriptions of clinical programs. Table 5A provides an overview of the key findings from these articles relating to health system impact for post -COVID conditions , while Ta ble 6D in the Appendix section contains the detailed information extracted from each document. Using the below described adapted MMAT (Hong et al., 2018), 14 primary -literature articles were considered high quality (Al-Aly et al., 2020; Ayoubkhani et al., 2021; Banerjee et al., 2021; al., 2021; Castro- et al., 2020; D'Cruz et al., 2021; -Romieu et al., et al., 2021; 2021; al., 2021; Vanichkachorn et al., 2021; Whittaker et al., 2021; Yong, 2020) ; 3 considered moderate quality (Hassenpflug et al., 2020; Vaes et al., 2021; Wildwing & Holt, 2021) 1 low quality (Parkin et al., 2021) . Synthesis of the Information Relating to Question 5 & 5a While there are a total of 22 articles included in this synthesis, they fall into three categories: (1) empirical studies that inform actual health service utilization by patients after COVID -19 infection (n=9); (2) empirical studies that provide limited insights into health service utilization and impacts (n=4); and (3) review articles that provide generic guidance and hypothetical considerations around health service impact (n=9). For the empirical studies, median (minimum, maximum) sample size was 431 (33, 73,435). The mean (standard deviati on) of 9144.0(21404.4) demonstrate highly variable sample sizes due to the mix of studies relying on administrative data (n=8) versus primary data collection (n=6). Even within the administrative data studies, there was substantial variation as some studies looked across populations or systems, while others used administrative data to describe a small, local clinic population. The follow up period in these studies was limited given evolution of the pandemic, with the mean (standard deviation) was 13.44 (6. 16) and mean 13 weeks - however, studies varied on the starting point of these follow -up periods: first symptoms of COVID -19, data of diagnosis, or date of hospital discharge which introduced potentially several weeks of additional variability. All of the se studies (primary and secondary literature) focused on adult populations. They varied in that 9 included all types of COVID -19 patients, while 7 focused on only those who had been hospitalized with COVID -19, 3 considered only those who had community -only experiences of COVID -19, and 1 focused on a specific sub- population (visitors to a specific clinic). While all studies are elaborated in Tables 5A and 6D, the following synthesis will highlight select article in -text for the three categories. Empirical St udies Nine empirical studies attempted to quantify the health service utilization of patient populations directly affected by COVID -19, whether solely in the community or in hospital (Ayoubkhani et al., 2021; Banerjee et al., 2021; D'Cruz et al., 2021; Hernandez -Romieu et al., 2021; Lund et al., 46 Last revised: 12 , al., 2021; Whittaker et al., 2021) . Most studies looked at a mix of hospitalized and non -hospitalized patients. Menges et al (2021) found that, over a mean of 21.7 weeks of follow -up, 40% (170 of 431) of adults who tested posit ive for COVID -19 self -reported having had at least one contact with the healthcare system (i.e., re- hospitalization, general practitioner visits, or medical hotline calls) related to COVID -19. Specific COVID- 19-related usage included 10% had re- hospitalizations (of the 81 who were initially hospitalized for COVID -19), 36% visited their general practitioner, and 7% called a medi cal hotline at least once (Menges et al., 2021) . Among those, the median number of general practitioner visits and hotline calls were 2 and 1, respectively (Menges et al., 2021) . Only 33% of those who had not fully recovered indicated they did not seek out healthcare. New physician- diagnosed medical conditions were reported by 18%. Not having fully recovered (OR 3.53, 95% CI 2.14 to 5.86, p<0.001), experiencing grade (OR 2.35, to 3.99, p<0.001), fatigue (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.50, p=0.03) and symptoms of depression ( OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.45, p=0.002) were independently associated with having contact with the healthcare system (Menges et al., 2021) . Some study limitations include risk of self -selection and recall bias, and lack of baseline for comparison. Whittaker et al (2021) (n=46,687) used administrative data to determine healthcare utilization post-acute COVID -19. This study found increase utilization in hospitalized vs. comm unity -only groups of COVID -19 survivors (Whittaker et al., 2021) . The hospitalized group utilized more healthcare (including GP visits, referrals, emergency department, hospitalization) than the community group post -COVID -19, with a 2.7 -fold difference in rates per 100,000 person- weeks [95%CI] between (52,775 [50,570 to 55,105] v. 19,405 [19,142 to 19,673]) in hospitalized and community groups, respectively (Whittaker et al., 2021) . Lund et al (2021) examined administrative data (n=8,983) after COVID -19 positive tests for a mean of 12 weeks. While 73.0% of non -hospitalized individuals with COVID -19 either visited their general practitioner, visited an outpatient clinic or were admitted to hospital, the number for COVID -19-negative controls was 77.1% (Lund et al., 2021) . However, when PER R-adjusted risk ratios are presented, COVID -19-positive individuals have hig her risks for general practitioner visits (1\u00b718 [95% CI 1\u00b715 -1\u00b722]) and outpatient clinic visits (1\u00b710 [1\u00b705- 1\u00b716]) compared to COVID -19-negative individuals (Lund et al., 2021) . Among health -care users, most individuals had a single visit to the general practitioner or hospital outpatient clinic, and few individuals had five or more visits (Lund et al., 2021) . There are no material differences between cohorts for emergency department visits (1\u00b707 -Romieu et al (2021) used administrative data (n=3,171) to clarify longer -term health care utilization of non- hospitalized adults after COVID -19 diagnosis (mean follow -up 21.7 weeks; range 1 -6 months). In this population, 69% had 1+ outpatient visits (Hernandez -Romieu et al., 2021) . Active COVID -19 diagnoses* (10%) and symptoms potentially related to COVID -19 (3%-7%) were among the top 20 new visit diagnoses; rates of visits for these diagnoses declined from 2- 24 visits per 10,000 per son-days 28- 59 days after COVID -19 diagnosis to 1- 4 visits per 10,000 person- days 120- 180 days after diagnosis (Hernandez -Romieu et al., 2021) . Among adults with one or more outpatient visits, 7,991 visits occurred 28- 180 days after COVID -19 diagnosis, with a median of two ( interquartile range = 1- 4) visits per patient (Hernandez -Romieu et al., 2021) . Among specialists visited, 1,627 (75%) patients visited a family, geriatric, or internal medicine provider, and 823 (38%) visited with a new specialist (Hernandez -Romieu et al., 2021) . Common new specialty visits potentially related to patients saw a pulmonologist; 41 (71%) of these patients 47 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 had not been evaluated by this specialty in the 12 months preceding their COVID -19 diagnosis. Study limitations include a population of mostly privately -insured individuals who likely differ from general populations; a lack of control group; and lack of clarity when and how the COVID - 19 diagnosis code was used across the system. Nevertheless, this study reveals a reduction in number of visits for COVID -19-related outpatient visits over time, especially compare weeks 4 -8 to weeks 12- 24. Vaes et al (2021) elaborated self -reported health service utilizat ion at 12 and 24 weeks post - onset of acute COVID -19 symptoms (n=1,556). More patients received physiotherapy or rehabilitation in the 3- 6 months of follow -up period compared to the 0- 3 months of follow -up (61.9% 2021) . However, between 3- 6 months of follow -up, significant improvements were found in patients who did and did not receive physiotherapy or rehabilitation (Vaes et al., 2021) . Patients receiving physiotherapy reported more symptoms (6 vs. 4, p<0.05) and a worse self -reported health (84.5% good vs. 91.7% good, p<0.05), functional status (grade 2.6 vs. 2.0, p<0.05) and quality of life (0.613 vs. 0.706 mean index EQ -5D-5L, p<0.05) compared to patients who did not receive physiotherapy or rehabilitation (Vaes et al., 2021) . Similar differences found at 6 months (all p<0.05). This suggests that rehabilitation services may face increased demand further from the pandemic su rges versus in the immediate aftermath. The quality of this paper was particularly questioned because the statistics reported in the article varied from that found in the article's supplemental material. Banerjee et al (2021) completed a relatively short follow -up for 4 weeks to assess outcomes of those COVID -19 survivors sent home with home oxygen and nursing support post -discharge. This study demonstrated a 30 -day readmission rate of 8.5% (95% CI, 6.2% -10.7%) with a median follow -up time of 26 days (interquartile range, 15 -55 days), which was framed as lower than the overall post -acute care 30 -day readmission rate for DHS patients (15.2%), as reported to California Department of Health Care Services in 2020 (Banerjee et al., 2021) . This small study has many limitations include no control, very short follow -up period, and lack of contextualization of how many patients overall used this service. Nevertheless, the study would indicate some utility in use of home oxygen for COVID -19 survivo rs post -discharge, which would lead to health service impact in making such resources and services available. Ayoubkhani et al (2021) looked at re -admission rates and new diagnoses post -discharge for patients who experienced severe COVID -19-related hospitalizations for an average of 20 weeks after discharge (n=47,780). After initial discharge, 29.4% of COVID -19 patients were readmitted to hospital (compared to 9.2% of controls with similar personal and clinical characteristics) (Ayoubkhani et al., 2021) . Ayoubkhani et al (2021) determined that novel diagnoses after discharge with major adverse cardiovascular event, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease and diabetes were 3.0 (2.7 to 3.2), 2.8 (2.0 to 4.0), 1.9 (1.7 to 2.1), and 1.5 (1.4 to 1.6) times more frequent, respectively, in COV ID-19 patients than in the matched control groups. It is likely that this population includes many syndromes (e.g. post -ICU syndrome) given its focus on severe COVID -19. Depending on one's definition of post -COVID conditions , this study may, or may not, inform the future health service impacts of post -COVID conditions . Vanichkachorn et al (2021) (n=100) described the patient population at a specialty, rehabilitation- focused outpatient clinic. Most patients presented at 12 -weeks post -diagnosis, and their health service utilization was noted. The clinic program included a function- focused interview, standard laboratory assessments and optional diagnostic tests or consultations (Vanichkachorn et al., 2021) . Service -wise, common health services used included physical therapy (42%), occupational therapy (27%), brain rehabilitation consultation (22%), and 48 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 al., 2021) . Diagnostically, co mmon 2021) . This study, while of limited generalizabili ty, does provide insight on the health system cost and needs implications within specialty post -COVID clinics. D'Cruz et al (2021) focused on post -discharge sequelae in the 7- 9 week follow -up period (n=119). Using self -report, survey respondents indicated that 57 (48%) patients used hospital services following hospital discharge (D'Cruz et al., 2021) . Herein, 23 (40%) attended out patient appointments for monitoring of inpatient complications (hematology, renal, diabetes), 16 (28%) attended the emergency department, nine (16%) were re- hospitalized and nine (16%) attended planned outpatient appointments for pre -existing comorbidities . Thus, health service use post - discharge ranged between 16- 40% up to 9 weeks post -discharge. This, like many other studies, lacks a control group and is susceptible to recall and selection bias (D'Cruz et al., 2021) . In sum, the following are some of the key insights from these articles (elaborated above in text and in Table 5A): Adult COVID -19 survivors have been recorded to access the following health services after the acut e infection: emergency department, acute care, home care, outpatient specialty clinics, general practitioners, and telehealth lines. Adult COVID -19 survivors often undergo additional diagnostic testing and imaging after the acute infection. These tests inc lude chest X -ray, blood tests, spirometry, trans thoracic echocardiogram, autonomic reflex testing, as well as functional assessments such as the six minute walking test. A regular proportion of adult COVID -19 survivors appear to receive new diagnoses of chronic medical conditions after the acute infection. The prevalence of health service utilization post -acute COVID -19 may range from 16- 40% up to 9 weeks post -discharge (D'Cruz et al., 2021) ; 29.4% for re weeks (Ayoubkhani et al., 2021) ; 8.5% re -admission rate if sent home with supplemental oxygen (Banerjee et al., 2021) ; or, 10% re- hospitalizations, 36% visited their general practitioner, and 7% called a medi cal hotline at least once (Menges et al., 2021) . The frequency and duration of health service utilization post -COVID -19 is unclear. One study suggested that most COVID -19 survivors have 1 general practitioner visit with a minority requiring 5 or more visits (Lund et al., 2021) . Another study suggested that 2- 24 visits per 10,000 person- days in 28- 59 days after COVID -19 diagnosis relative to 1- 4 visits per 10,000 person- days 120- 180 days after diagnosis (Hernandez -Romieu et al., 2021) . A limited number of studies do suggest that health service utilization does decrease over time. However, these studies do not (and cannot) extend beyond one year. Other paper s (cited below) highlight that post -COVID conditions have a relapsing -remitting nature and that follow -up for one year minimum is suggested. I t is difficult to anticipate with any certainty whether health service needs will continue indefinitely or for a time- limited period. The data indicating many novel diagnoses of chronic health conditions suggests the former over the later. Many of these studies had significant limitations, mostly due to a lack of control group or contextualization of the study participant utilization relative to a comparable or broade r population. In addition, primary survey studies had concerns of recall bias and administrative data studies had concerns of inaccurate coding. 49 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Empirical, but Limited Insight Four articles are empirical in nature, but offered little insights into the exac t utilization impacts of health services in the post -acute phase of COVID -19 (Al-Aly et al., 2020; Bowles et al., 2021; Castro -Avila et al., 2020; Hassenpflug et al., 2020) . Castro -Avila et al (2020) provide qualitative interviews with clinicians, who describe current post -ICU practices with COVID- 19 patients and how that is expected to continue into the future. Hassenpflug et al (2020) describe the care provided to those who transferred from acute care to a long -term care facility and the reasons for their short stays. The study's insights are quite limited as it is unclear what proportion of hospitalized COVID -19 patients requi re such care. Al-Aly et al. (2020) performed a secondary data analysis (n=73,435) on never -hospitalized COVID -19 survivors (vs. controls) for around 18 weeks follow -up. The study reports increases in novel medication and medical diagnoses during follow -up, but does not clarify the size or frequency of such new health needs nor their impact on health service utilization (Al -Aly et al., 2020) . Bowles et al (2021) examined home care service utilization post -discharge for adult COVID -19 survivors (n=1,409). The majority (94%) of patients were discharged from home care a fter an average of 32 days of care (SD, 25.7); 1241 (87%) were discharged without any adverse events (re-hospitalization or death) (Bowles et al., 2021) . More than half (57% ) of those re -hospitalized returned to home care and were subsequently discharged (n= 78) (Bowles et al., 2021) . Patients received an average of 11.1 home- care visits (95% CI, 10.8 to 11.4 visits), with 76% being in- person and 16% by phone or 8% by tele- video (Bowles et al., 2021) . The home -care services were provided mostly by registered nurses (52%) or physical therapists (37%), but occasionally by social workers, occupational therapists, or speech language pathologists (Bowles et al., 2021) . There are no controls or contextualization to determine how many hospitalized patients with COVID -19 required home care, this study does provide insights on the service utilization of those that do. These studies perhaps best complement the next category of papers that provide general guidance to health systems on preparing for care of patients with post -COVID conditions . General Guidance for Post COVID -19 Care Nine articles, whether reviews or other study designs, offered general guidance on health service structuring and clinical approaches (Maxwell, 2020; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence et al., 2020; Nurek et al., 2021; O'Sullivan, 2021; 2021; Wildwing Holt, 2021; World Health Organization, 2021b; Yong, 2020) . These studies suggest the following: Prepare health systems with clear clinical pathways to support assessment and management of post-COVID conditions Ensure that care of patients with post -COVI D conditions is multidisciplinary and integrated, with involvement of general practitioners, rehabilitation providers, and medical specialists Ensure that clinicians and patients are aware of the myriad bodily systems that can be implicated and affected by post-COVID conditions , as well as the relapsing- remitting nature of the syndrome Promote the use of patient -centred care principles and practices such as shared decision- making and patient -centred goal identification 50 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Make self -management information and advice readily available for those affected by post-COVID conditions Enable effect ive assessments by empowering clinicians with in-person opportunities as appropriate Recognize that traditional approaches to rehabilitation may need to be modified in the context of post -COVID conditions based on patient abilities Recognize that, while appropriate frequency and duration of follow -up of patients post - COVID is not clearly d efined, one review recommended at least seven interactions (4 in- person) between health care providers and patients in the first 12 months, and likely four instances of follow -up assessment and imaging (i.e. CT scan, six -minute walk tests, blood tests, and antibody tests). None of these recommendations were grounded in empirical evidence that involve d patients post-COVID (whether cited studies or their own empirical work). Nevertheless, they represent expert opinions on how health systems may best approach the care of their population of individuals with post-COVID conditions . Table 5 A. Summary of Articles Informing Implications for Health Service Utilization Author Study Details (Article Type, Country, Study Design) Implications around Health Services (Al-Aly et al., 2020) Peer - reviewed USA Observational Cohort COVID -19 negative controls, community and hospital N=73,435 Secondary analysis of administrative data from Veterans' Affairs, included negative- outcome contr ols ( Median follow -up 18 weeks Increased novel use of medication and medical diagnoses after COVID -19 infection even when never -hospitalized. Study does not clarify what health services are used to \"get\" to those diagnoses. Observed an increased risk of the incident use of several classes of medication, including pain medications (opioid and non- opioid), antidepressant, anxiolytic, antihypertensive, anti -hyperlipidemic and oral hypoglycemic drugs and insulin. An increased risk of a broad array of specific clinical manifestations that include acute coronary disease, arrhythmias, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, memory prob lems and thromboembolic disease. (Ayoubkhani et al., 2021) Peer - reviewed UK Observational Cohort hospitalized, lab confirmed N=47,780 Aim: Estimate excess morbidity after severe COVID -19 (hospitalized) using administrative data Mean follow -up 20 weeks Increased rates of re- admission and new diagnoses post - discharge for severe COVID -19 hospitalization. Study does not clarify what health services are used to \"get\" to those diagnoses. After admission to hospital for COVID -19, 29.4% were readmitted (compared to 9.2% of controls with similar personal and clinical characteristics in control) Those with COVID -19 were diagnosed with major adverse cardiovascular event, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes after discharge 51 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 from hospital 3.0 (2.7 to 3.2), 2.8 (2.0 to 4.0), 1.9 (1.7 to 2.1), and 1.5 (1.4 to 1.6) times more frequently, respectively, than in the matched control group. NOTE: focus on severe COVID -19, so likely many syndromes (e.g. post -ICU syndrome) implicated in post - discharge health service use. (Ban erjee et al., 2021) Peer - reviewed USA Observational Cohort hospitalized, lab confirmed N=621 Aim: Assess outcomes post -discharge with supplemental home oxygen (and nursing education) Follow -up about 4 weeks Study details mortality and readmission rate for patients post-COVID19 who received home oxygen. Does not indicate % of overall patients who used this, just outcomes of the ones that did use home oxygen. The all -cause mortality rate was 1.3% (95% CI, 0.6% - 2.5%) and the 30- day return hospital admission rate was 8.5% (95% CI, 6.2% -10.7%) with a median follow -up time of 26 days (interquartile range, 15- 55 days). The observed 30- day readmission rate for these home oxygen patients was also lower than the overal l post - acute care 30- day readmission rate for DHS patients (15.2%), as reported to California Department of Health Care Services in 2020. LIMIT: no control in this study and short follow -up period (Bowles et al., 2021) Peer - reviewed USA Observational Cohort Hospitalized COVID -19 patients N=1,409 Aim: Describe home health recovery of adults with COVID - 19 and risk factors associated with re- hospitalization or death Mean follow -up 12 weeks Study elaborates usage of home health care serv ices, including average visits and type of therapy used. No control comparison so difficult to predict how many will need home health care, but for those that go it does provide insights. Most visits (76%) were in person, 16% by telephone, and 8% by tele- video. Registered nurses provided 52% of the visits, physical therapists provided 37%, and the remainder were provided by social workers and occupational and speech therapists. The patients received average of 11.1 visits. 137 (10% [CI, 8.1% to 11.2%]) were re-hospitalized. After an average of 32 days of care (SD, 25.7), 94% of patients with COVID -19 in home health care were discharged (n= 1319); 1241 (87%) were discharged without any adverse events (re- hospitalization or death). More than half (57%) of tho se re- hospitalized returned to HH C and were subse quently discharged (n= 78) (Castro -Avila et al., 2020) Peer - reviewed UK Sequential mixed - methods (qualitative) N=193 care staff and GP s Sequential mixed methods (online survey and interviews) Aim: Identify follow -up services available during and after UK's first wave of COVID -19 pandemic, and views of critical care staff and GPs on patients' future needs.

See post - 52 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 ICU and rehabilitation support important. But, no metrics on actual utilization. Most care provided virtually, but not considered adequate by staff. Barriers to follow -up care service provision: funding complexities, remit and expertise, and communication between ICU and community services. (D'Cruz et al., 2021) Peer - reviewed UK Observational Cohort hospitalized, lab confirmed N=119 Aim: investigate sequelae of severe COVID -19 pneumonia (hospitalization 48hrs), and identify risk f actors Follow -up 7- 9 weeks post -discharge follow -up Study noted hospital service use post -discharge and found 16-40% used some services. Time frame is lacking and no controls. 57 (48%) patients used hospital services following hospital discharge: 23 (40%) attended outpatient appointments for monitoring of inpatient complications (hematology, renal, diabetes), 16 (28%) attended the emergency department, nine (16%) were re- hospitalized and nine (16%) attended planned outpatient appointments for pre -existing c omorbidities. (Hassenpflug et al., 2020) Peer - reviewed USA Quality Improvement hospitalized, lab confirmed N=41 Aim: describe first series of patients with COVID -19 admitted to post -acute hospital Based on administrative data Median length of stay at post -acute hospital: 6 weeks Study unclear on what proportion of hospitalized patients go to post -acute hospital. Few insights on health service utilization. Of 194 patients transferred to post -acute hospital during study period, 41 (21%) were admitted for continued recovery from confirmed COVID -19 pneumonia. Upon evaluation by the consulting pulmonologist on admission to facility , patients were determined not to be weaning candidates for the following reasons: physiologic instability (unmet readiness to wean parameters), and poor mentation or neurocognitive disorders. LIMITS: Small cohort, unique population, relatively short follow -up, and unclear on service utilization fully in long- term care. (Hernandez - Romieu et al., 2021) Peer - reviewed USA Observational Cohort Non-hospitalized N=3171 Aim: clarify longer -term health care utilization and clinical characteristics of non- hospitalized adults after COVID -19 diagnosis Mean follow -up 21.7 weeks Study provides frequency of contact/utilization with the healthcare system in the 28 -180 days after COVID -19 diagnosis. Offers some insight on usage over time. 69% had one or more outpatient visits during the follow - up period of 28- 180-days. Among adults with one or more outpatient visits, 7,991 visits occurred 28 -180 days after COVID -19 diagnosis, with a median of two (interquartile range = 1 -4) visits 53 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 per patient . Fewer than 2% (32) of patients were hospitalized 28- 180 days after COVID -19 di agnosis. More than two thirds of patients (1,617; 68%) had visits for a new primary diagnosis. Among specialists visited, 1,627 (75%) patients visited a family, geriatric, or internal medicine provider, and 823 (38%) visited with a new specialist. COVID -19-related visits declined from 24 per 10,000 person- days during the 28 -59-day interval to fewer than two per 10,000 person- days during the 120- 180-day interval. Visits per 10,000 person- days for symptoms potentially related to COVID -19 declined during thes e same intervals, including those for throat or chest pain (from seven per 10,000 person- days to four), shortness of breath (from eight to three), cough (from four to two), and malaise and fatigue (from four to two). In contrast, rates of visits with chron ic disease diagnoses (e.g., hypertension and diabetes) and urinary tract infections changed little over time. LIMITS: mostly privately insured population; no non- COVID -19 control group; unclear whether use of COVID -19 diagnosis visit code used by providers . (Lund et al., 2021) Peer - reviewed Denmark Observational Cohort Community - only; lab- confirmed N=8983 Aim: To examine prescription drug and health- care use after SARS- CoV-2 infection not requiring hos pitalization Administrative data Mean follow -up 12 weeks Study gives insights on health service utilization and compares with COVID -19 negative individuals over same period. 6557 (73\u00b70%) of 8983 non- hospitalized individuals (77\u00b71%) of 80894 SARS- CoV-2-negative individuals had visited their general practitioner, were seen at a hospital outpatient clinic, or were admitted to hospital (appendix p 5). Comparing overall health- care use between SARS -CoV- 2-positive and SARS -CoV-2-negative individuals, we observed increased PERR -adjusted rate ratios for general practitioner visits (1\u00b718 [95% 1\u00b715- 1\u00b722]) and outpatient clinic visits (1\u00b710 [1\u00b705- 1\u00b716]) among SARS - CoV-2-positive individuals. We found no material difference bet ween cohorts for emergency department visits health- care users, most individuals had a single visit to the general practitioner or hospital outpatient clinic, an d few individuals had fi ve or more visits . LIMITS: F ollow -up was limited to 6 months after a test for SARS- CoV-2, which might not yet account for all long- term complications and persisting symptoms after COVID -19. Information on the indication for testing was not available.

Nature of report means no insight on frequency of utilization. Assessment recommendations for integrated multidisciplinary rehabilitation services (e.g. consider all bodily systems; personal goal identification; symptom management advice for all presenting symptoms; make follow -up strategy; and shared decision -making ) (Menges et al., Switzerland Observational confirmed, community N=431 Aim: assess prevalence of symptomatology and health care utilization at least 6 months after COVID -19 infection. Mean follow -up 21.7 weeks Study provides frequency of contact/utilization with the healthcare system after COVID -19 positive test. Offers some insight on risk factors for healthcare usage. A total of 170 (40%) participants reported having had at least one contact with the healthcare system (i.e., re- hospitalization, general practitioner visits, or medical hotline calls) for reasons related to COVID -19. Out of 81 individuals who were initially hospitalized due to COVID -19, eight (10%) were admitted to a hospital again at least once due to persistent symptoms or COVID -19 related complications, with a maximum of three re- hospitalizations. More than half of the participants (n=224, 52%) reported at least one general practitioner visit for any reason, and 150 (36%) had a general practitioner visit related to COVID -19. Among those, the median number of general practitioner visits related to COVID -19 was 2 (IQR 1 to 3). 31 (7%) participants reported to have called a medical hotline at least once for a reason related to COVID -19, with a median of 1 call (IQR 1 to 2). Among those that had not fully recovered, 37 (33%) did not report further healthcare contacts . Since SARS- CoV-2 infection, a new physician- diagnosed medical condition was reported by 77 (18%) participants. 27 (35%) of these diagnoses were considered to be related to COVID -19 by a physician. In multivariable regression analyses, we found evidence for an association between healthcare use and initial hospital ization, having experienced severe to very severe symptoms, sex, and age 40 years. Furthermore, not having fully recovered (OR 3.53, 95% CI 2.14 to 5.86, p<0.001), experiencing grade (OR 2.35, to 3.99, p<0.001), fatigue (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.50, p=0.03) and symptoms of depression (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.45, p=0.002) were independently associated with having contact with the healthcare system. LIMITS: testing capacity early in pandemic might mean more severely -affected populat ion; risk of self -selection bias; revised: July 12 , 2021 of baseline; not all health service utilization (i.e. no specialty use or diagnostic services); (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence et al., 2020) Grey Literature UK Review Review document Aim: guidance to assist healthcare systems establish and maintain post -COVID assessment services Paper provides recommendations on types of health services likely required, but nature of report means no insight on frequency of utilization.

Long COVID clinics must operate in context of rapidly evolving practice amongst both GPs and specialists. Care pathways in holistic care, investigation of specific complications, management of potential symptom clusters in cardiac disease, dysautonomia and mast cell disorder, and individualized rehabilitation are needed. Long COVID alone is insufficient diagnosis unless other causes have been excluded. Require face- to-face assessment Lots of diagnostic imaging and specialty referrals are recommended for appropriate assessment.

Research suggests that treating people with long COVID requires a multidisciplinary approach including evaluation, symptomatic treatment, treatment of underlying problems, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and psychological support. Some recommendations on management, with follow -up being most indicative of what health services may be required. But, no clarity on whether a chr onic disease model or time -limited condition is at issue.

After the onset of COVID -19 related symptoms, patients receiving physiotherapy reported more symptoms (6 vs. 4, p<0.05) and a worse self -reported health (84.5% good vs. 91.7% good, p<0.05) , work productivity, functional status (grade 2.6 vs. 2.0, p<0.05) and quality of life (0.613 vs. 0.706 mean index EQ -5D-5L, p<0.05) compared to patients who did not receive physiotherapy or rehabilitation. Similar differences found at 6 months (all p<0.05). Between 3 and 6 months of follow -up, significant improvements were found in both pat ients who did and did not receive physiotherapy or rehabilitation.

(Vanichkachorn et al., 2021) Peer - reviewed article USA Observational Cohort N=100 Population: adults with positive COVID -19 test and symptoms four or more weeks after positive test. Description of patient population at a specialty, rehabilitation- focused outpatient clinic (COVID Activity Rehabilitation Program) Most patient presented at 12 weeks post -diagnosis 57 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Hospitalized and non- hospitalized Describes elements of the program, and some utilization statistics Program elements include: function- focused interview; standard laboratory assessments; optional diagnostic tests; optional consultations Some statistics on the therapy, referral and diagnostic use by patients visiting outpatient clinic: Physical therapy (42%) ; Occupational therapy (27%) ; Brain rehabilitation consultation (22%) ; Infectious disease consultation (6%) ; Chest X -ray (20%) (Whittaker et al., 2021) Preprint UK Observational Cohort Both hospitalized and non- hospitalized, lab confirmed N=46,687 Aim: To investigate new primary care- recorded symptoms, diseases, prescriptions and healthcare utilization in patients post-acute COVID -19 infection, comparing outcomes between community -only and hospitalized patients Increased health service utilization in hospitalized vs. community -only group. The hospitalized group utilized more healthcare (including GP visits, referrals, emergency department , hospitalization) than the community group post -COVID - 19, with a 2.7- fold difference in rates per 100,000 person- weeks [95%CI] between groups (52,775 [50,570 to 55,105] v. 19,405 [19,142 to 19,673]) in hospitalized and community groups, respectively. Regarding utilization among the 6 and 12 months prior, healthcare utilization increased in both groups post - COVID -19 relative to pre- pandemic levels, this was much higher in the hospitalized group (61.2% increase v. 28.5%). Healthcare utilization was lower 6 months prior relative to other time -points for each group. (World Health Organization, 2021b) Grey literature article Denmark Review Policy brief, provides a review of larger population -based studies of the various approaches taken across multiple countries to best define, understand, and provide care for post-COVID conditions . A review that touches on health system implications in caring for patients with post -COVID conditions , specifically the persistent symptoms: Survey of UK general practitioners in 2020 found that 67% were looking after patients with COVID -19 symptoms lasting longer than 12 weeks . Only 23% had access to a Long COVID clinic that they could refer into (Royal College of General Practitioners, 2020). Recommendations on model of care for post -COVID conditions should include multidisciplinary assessment services ; should bring together physicians with expertise in different body systems, as well as multidisciplinary rehabilitation services, with core teams that could include, but not be limited to, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, clinical psychology and psychiatry, and rehabilitation medicine. (Wildwing & Holt, 2021) Peer - reviewed UK Systematic Review (n=45 studies) Aim: systematic review of reviews of neurological symptoms of COVID -19 and implications for health care services 58 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Research Question 5b (Return to Work) : What are the implications for return to work for employees, their employers and for health care workers involved in assessments for return to work? Evidence from secondary and grey literature This synthesis includes o ne grey literature document : a World Health Organization policy brief that touches upon the return- to-work implications of post-COVID conditions (World Health Organization, 2021b) . Systematic Review Neurologic symptom focus Review speaks to likely but hypothetical needs of patients with post-COVID conditions . No empirical data. Symptoms seen in Long Covid such as facial pain, muscle issues, neuralgia, fatigue and insomnia, ma y become long term and disabling, requiring sustained support from healthcare services such as pain- , fatigue - and sleep- clinics, neurological services and primary care. The effects of COVID -19 on overstretched neurological services is hard to predict, as the neuropathy, myopathy and sensory deficits of SARS resolv ed within 3 months of recovery. However, as COVID -19 appears to be becoming Long Covid for up to 10% of patients, support is likely to be required, potentially for a significant number of people, if their symptoms do not resolve spontaneously. (Yong, 2020) Peer - reviewed Malaysia Review Narrative review Focus on pathophysiology, risk factors and treatments in long COVID Literature review describes broad need for rehabilitation for long COVID, but that has to be personalized to this condition and these patients. No empirical data, more recommendations. No data on size/frequency of this utilization. According to reviews, in rehabilitation, patients are advised to perform light aerobic exercise paced according to individual capacity. Exercise difficulty le vels are increased gradually within tolerated levels until improvements in fatigue and dyspnea are seen, typically four to six weeks. Risks of physical rehabilitation must also be considered. Systematic and scoping reviews have identified that rehabilitat ion may not be suitable for survivors of critical COVID -19 with severe pulmonary or cardiac damage. Hence, exclusion criteria for post -COVID -19 rehabilitation have been proposed: high resting heart rate (>100 beats/min), low or high blood pressure (<90/60 or>140/90mmHg), low blood oxygen saturation (<95%), or other conditions where exercise is a contraindication. Indeed, an international survey study found that 85.9% of participants with long COVID experienced symptom relapse following mental or physical activities. 59 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Evidence from the primary literature This synthesis on return to work and post-COVID conditions is based on 7 primary articles (5 peer-reviewed articles and 2 preprints), including 4 cross -sectional surveys, 2 observational cohorts, and 1 article describing a clinical pathway. Three articles were from the UK, while 1 each were from the USA and four separate European countries (Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway). Table 5B summarizes the key takeaways from these articles relating to return to work implications for post-COVID conditions , while Table 6E in the Appendix section contains the information extracted from each document. Synthesis of the Information Relating to Question 5b Return to work reflects occupational productivity, which can manifest in 3 ways: ( 1) reduced workforce participation (either early retirement or other workforce withdrawal); (2) absenteeism (temporary in nature; where worker remains in the workforce but is required to take time off work due to being unwell); and (3) presenteeism (lower productivity at work, where a worker produces less due to lower capacity to work) (Smith & Hillner, 2019) . In brief, illness can impact individuals' ability to return to work at all, or their regularity or capacity upon return. This narrative synthesis sought to elaborate scientific findings related to any of these three manifestations related to return to work and productivity. The body of evidence on the return to work implications of post -COVID conditions is small, and suggest only emergent learning. Using the below described adapted Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) (Hong et al., 2018), 6 studies were o f high quality ; 1 of mixed quality (Davis et al., 2021; Vaes et al., 2021) ; and 2 of low quality (Parkin et al., 2021; World Health Organization, 2021b) . While 3 studies based findings on primary data collection using a survey, 4 studies used secondary analysis of administrative data, 1 study used a Delphi panel, and 1 study provided no empirical data but international guidance on impact of post -COVID conditions on return to work. The mean (standard deviation) and median sample s ize of the 7 empirical studies are 1,290 (1445.1) and 891, respectively. These 8 studies include a mean (standard deviation) of 16.1 (7.43) weeks of follow -up; the median length of follow -up is 13 weeks. Types of populations of focus included all COVID -19 patients (n=6), hospitalized- only COVID- 19 patients (n=1), and a sub-population (employed persons) (n=1). The 3 primary -data studies used online surveys with a mean of 2,419 participants, and recruited from social media platforms wherein respondents already self -identified as having post -COVID conditions (or 'Long COVID') (Davis et al., al., 2021; al., Davis et al (2021), 68.9% of unrecovered respondents had either reduced workforce participation or absenteeism, compared to 45.6% of recovered respondents. At least 45% of those who were working indicated that remote working accommodations were critical to their continued ability to w ork. In Machado et al (2021), a statistically significant association was found between level of functional impairment post -COVID and the experience of absenteeism (p<0.05), presenteeism (p<0.05) and work impairment (p<0.05). Finally, Vaes et al (2021) found that absenteeism and presenteeism was prevalent amongst survey respondents at 61% and 65%, respectively at 3 months. However, a statistically significant reduction in both were noted at 6 months, with absenteeism and presenteeism reducing to 48% and 57% , respectively (both p<0.001). Overall working impairment was 73% at 3 months and 62% at 6 months (different statistically significant, p<0.001). Examinations of administrative data reveal utilization of formal sick leaves (Skyrud et al., 2021) or self -report to clinics about occupational productivity (O'Sullivan et al., 2021; Parkin et al., 2021; Vanichkachorn et al., 2021) . Skyrud et al (2021) studied the working population of Norway (n=740,182) and found that use of sick leave increases for those testi ng positive for COVID -19 60 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 for the week of testing, but returns to pre- testing, population- level norm levels 3- 4 months after testing. Skyrud et al (2021) was the only included study that used administrative data versus self-report. Amongst those who feel unwell and test ed positive for COVID -19, 28.5% require sick leaves the test week and this population returns to 2.8% at month 3 post -testing. Amongst those who fell unwell and test ed negative for COVID -19, 9.0% require sick leaves the test week and this population returns to 2.6% at month 3 post -testing. Vanichkachorn et al (2021) found that 31% of patients presenting to post -COVID outpatient clinics at 12 weeks post -diagnosis had not returned to work; of the 69% who returned to work, only 46% (32% total) had returned to unrestricted work duty. Parkin et al (2021) found that 54% of patient s support ed by a multidisciplinary rehabilitation pathway experienced reduced workforce participation or absenteeism when symptoms persisted beyond 7 weeks from hospital discharge. It is likely that those who attend post -COVID clinics have higher rates of work impair ment than the general population experiencing post COVID syndrome. Finally, O'Sullivan et al (2021) found that military personnel with ongoing rehabilitation needs post -COVID require assessment and management support to return to work . There was no prevalence data provided in this study. This small set of studies , which have varied design and potential bias, suggest the following implications : Implications for employees It appears patients with post -COVID conditions experience reduced workforce participation (31-54%) , absenteeism (48-61%) and presenteeism ( 25-69%). The prevalence of these experiences is statistically lower at 6 months than 3 months from the time of acute infection. A Norwegian study suggests that reduced workforce participant brought about by post-COVID conditions dissipates by 3 months post -onset of acute symptoms. Implications for employers Employees who experience post -COVID conditions may require compensated leaves and/or remote working accommodations to overcome the illness' impact on pr oductivity. Employers should discuss suitable arrangements with employees to aid return to work. Implications for health care providers The symptoms of post-COVID conditions impact patients' workforce participation and productivity. Occupational implicati ons should be both at assessment of functional impairment, and in developing rehabilitation care plans to manage functional impairment. Employers and employees should be provided with written advice from the health system, including information on the relapsing- remitting nature of the illness. Health care providers should take care in providing medical notes of fitness or lack thereof, and the connection to a medically -recognized diagnosis. The ability to return to (productive) work after illness is a m arker of recovery and should be recorded in clinical notes. There may be a potential need to develop standardized assessment tools to assist in return to work assessment and the need for further research, to reflect the notes gaps. Table 5B .

As stated above, international consensus processes are currently underway to confirm the appropriate terminology and case d efinitions of post - COVID conditions . Similarly, work is ongoing on the validation of screening tools, including the PCFS Scale. Inclusion of research on areas under -represented in this review (i.e. health service implications, impact of vaccination, and return to work implications) will need to be included in future iterations of this work. The mean proportion of work time missed in the previous week due to ill health (absenteeism) and impairment while working (presenteeism) reduced from 61% to 48% and from 65 % to 57%, respectively (both p<0.001).

C19- RehabNeQ has 57 items assigned to 7 main categories: Time of infection (1 item) Health problems caused by SARS -CoV-2 (14 items) Treatment (9 items) Activity and participation (13 items) Quality of life and general health (6 items) Health service provisions (5 items) Personal information (9 items) History: The C19- RehabNeS was first developed in German and the single dimensions were then translated into English. The items of the C19- RehabNeQ comprise individual questions from existing questionnaires and include newly developed questions to illustrate the particularities of a SARS -CoV-2 infection. The paper describes tool development by 5 specialists. There is not psychometric testing of its validity. Some of the tool has been validated on its own (i.e. previously -validated tools incorporated herein), but others have not and the tool as a whole has not been validated. (Machado et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed article The Netherlands Cross -sectional Survey Post -COVID Functio nal Status (PCFS) Scale Description: The scale was designed to cover the entire range of functional limitations from: grade 0, \"No functional limitations\" to grade 4, \"Severe functional limitations\" and grade 5, \"Death\". The PCFS Scale stratification is composed of five scale grades: grade 0 (No functional limitations); grade 1 (Negligible functional limitations); grade 2 (Slight functional limitations); grade 3 (Moderate functional limitations) grade 4 (Severe functional limitations). The final scale grade 5 'death', which is required to be able to use the scale as outcome measure in clinical trials, was left out for self -administered contexts. 66 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 The PCFS Scale can be used both at the time of hospital discharge, and to monitor f unctional status post dis charge. Psychometric testing data: Investigated the construct validity of the PCFS Scale. N=1,939 subjects about 3 months after the onset of infection- related symptoms. Found weak -to-strong statistical associations between functional status and all domains of health- related quality of life using the EQ -5D-5L (r: 0.233- 0.661). Notably, the strongest association found was with the 'usual activities' domain of the 5- level EQ -5D questionnaire. Using the WPAI questionnaire, a bsenteeism, presenteeism and work impairment were different considering all pairwise comparisons with exception of the comparison between subjects with no and negligible functional limitations and between subjects with moderate and severe functional limitations. Activity impairment increas ed gradually according to the decrease in functional status. Limit: a lack of power to detect small but meaningful differences among the latter groups might have affected these results.

(Tran et al., 2021) Preprint France Cross sectional survey Two tools: Long COVID Symptom Tool (ST) and Long COVID Impact Tool Description: Long COVID ST score reports the number of symptoms patients experienced over the last 30 days and has a theoretical range from 0 (no symptoms) to 53 (all symptoms identified during step 1). Long COVID IT score has a theoretical range of 0 (no impact) to 60 (maximum impact) and represents the sum of item scores for the 6 questions related to the disease's impact on their personal activities, family lives, professional lives, social lives, their morale, and their relationships with care providers. 68 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Paper is dedicated to development and validation of construct validity and reliability of the two tools (n=351). Qualitative patient work informed development. The long COVID ST and IT scores were highly correlated (rs=0.54, p<0.0001) and did not seem to differ by time from symptom onset . CONSTRUCT VALIDITY: The long COVID ST score was moderately and negatively correlated with the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire (rs = - 0.45, p<0.0001) and the EQ -VAS (rs = - 0.39, p<0.0001), while the long COVID IT score had a strongly negative correlation with the EQ -5D-5L questionnaire (rs = - 0.59, p<0.0001) and the EQ -VAS (rs = - 0.54, p<0.0001). For functional assessments using the PCFS, they found a moderate correlation between the long COVID ST score and the PCFS score (rs = - 0.39, p<0.0001) and a high correlation between the long COVID IT score and the PCFS score (rs = - 0.55, p<0.0001). For patients' perceived health state, the long COVID ST score was moderately correlated with the MYMOP2 score (rs = - 0.40, p<0.0001) while the long COVID IT score was highly correlated with it (rs = - 0.59, p<0.0001) RELIABILITY: Of the 351 patients invited to complete the long COVID ST and IT twice for the test -retest, 235 (67%) did so. The symptom score had an ICC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.86), with Bland and Altman plots showed a mean difference of 0.8 (95% limits of agreement, -14 and 16). The impact score's ICC was 0.84 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.87), with Bland and Altman plots showing a mean difference of 0.5 (95% limits of agreement, -11 to 12 (Figure 2). Finally, Cronbach's alpha was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.88 to 0.90) for the long COVID ST score and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.88) for the IT score. In sum, examinations of c onstruct validity demonstrated moderate or high correlations with patients' quality of life, functional status, and perceived health state. Reliability was str ong with an ICC 0.8 during the test -retest.

Rate ratios comparing patients with COVID -19 and matched controls were greater in individuals aged less than 70 than those aged 70 or more for all outcomes, however. 70 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 The largest differences in rate ratios were for death (14.1 (95% confidence interval 11.0 to 18.3) for age <70 years v 7.7 (7.1 to 8.3) for 70) and respiratory disease (10.5 (9.7 to 11.4) for age <70 v 4.6 (4.3 to 4.8) for 70). Ethnic differences in rate ratios were greatest for respiratory disease (11.4 (9.8 to 13.3) for individuals in the non- white group v 5.2 (5.0 to 5.5) in the white ethnic group). Differences in rate ratios between men and women were generally small (supplementary table 4). NOTE: focus on severe COVID -19, so likely many syndromes (e.g. post -ICU syndrome) implicated in post - discharge health service use. (Bellan et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed Italy Observational cohort N=238 Aim: evaluate the prevalence of lung function anomalies, exercise function impairment, and psychological sequelae among patients hospitalized for COVID -19, 4 months after discharge. Population: consecutive patients discharged from hospital during 4 month period RISK FACTORS: In logistic regression analysis, risk factors associated with D LCO less than 80% of expected (pulmonary function) at follow -up included female sex (odds ratio [OR], 4.33 [95% CI, 2.25 -8.33]; P<.001), CI, 2.00- 51.05]; P=.005), and the modality of oxyg en delivery hospital stay (OR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.08- 2.61]; P=.02). Risk factors associated with D LCO less than 60% at follow -up were female sex (OR, [95% CI, 1.37- 24.25]; P=.02) COPD was associated with an increased risk physical impairment (OR, 12.70 [95% CI, 1.41- 114.85]; P=.02), and higher D LCO was associated with decreased risk of physical impairment (OR, 0. 96 [95% CI, 0.94- 0.98]; P<.001). Authors describe male sex was the only factor independently associated with the presence of moderate to severe post -traumatic stress disorder symptoms (but in supplemental, the p=0.20). (Bowles et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed USA Observational cohort N=1,409 Aim: To describe the home health recovery of patients with COVID -19 and risk factors associated with re- hospitalization or death Population: COVID -19 survivors discharged to home care Mean follow -up 12 weeks RISK FACTORS Risk for re -hospitalization or death was higher among male patients (HR, 1.45 [CI, 1.04 to 2.03]); White patients (HR, 1.74 [CI, 1.22 to 2.47]); and patients who had heart fail ure (HR, 2.12 [CI, 1.41 to 3.19]), diabetes with complications (HR, 1.71 [CI, 1.17 to 2.52]), 2 or 71 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 more emergency department visits in the past 6 months (HR, 1.78 [CI, 1.21 to 2.62]) (Caronna et al., 2020) Peer -reviewed Spain Observational cohort N=130 Aim: To define headache characteristics and evolution in relation to COVID -19 and its inflammatory response Population: Consecutive patients with COVID -19 symptoms visiting emergency department Mean follow -up 6 weeks RISK FACTORS For patients with and without headache, for whom data were available at follow -up, and adjusting for age and gender, we observed shorter COVID -19 disease duration in the headache group (23.9 and 11.6 vs. 31.2 and 12.0 days; p =0.028). We did not observe any difference in mortality (no mortality in this sub group) or hospital length of stay (9.1 and 9.0 vs. 10.9 and 9.0 days; p= 0.854). LIMITS: patients had confirmed -19 diagnosis; single centre; one symptom of focus (D'Cruz et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed UK Observational cohort N=119 Aim: investigate sequelae of severe COVID -19 pneumonia (hospitalization 48hrs), and identify risk factors Prospective, single- centre observational cohort Follow -up 7- 9 weeks post -discharge follow -up Population: adults discharged after severe COVID -19 pneumonia (hospitalization 48hrs) Study noted hospital service use post -discharge and found 16-40% used some services. Time frame i s lacking and no controls. RISK FACTORS: Comorbid obstructive lung disease was associated with failure of mMRC recovery to baseline (OR 5.06, 95% CI 1.01 -7.98; p=0.047) Pre-morbid obstructive lung disease was associated with persistent (NRS 1) breathlessness (OR 8.04, 95% CI 0.19 -21.4; p=0.03) and cough (OR 3.43, 95% CI 0.98-12.0), but burdensome (NRS 4) cough (OR 1.97, 95% CI OR 2.27, 95% CI 0.38- 13.69; p=0.37, respectively). There were no associations between the presence or absence of pre -existing comorbidities and persistent fatigue, sleep disturbance or pain. Presence of COVID -19-related CT abnormalities was associated with mental health screening qu estionnaires (PHQ -9 >9, GAD -7 >9 -squared=3.98, 95% CI 0.02- 0.54; p=0.046), but not with any measure of patient - reported or physiological functional impairment (mMRC, PCFS, 4MGS <0.8 4% testing). Only 21% of patients with abnormal CT findings had an abnormal follow -up chest radiograph; however, 78% of those with oxygen desaturation 4% during STS also had abnormal CT findings. 72 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Ordinal logistic regression modelling was pe rformed for the outcomes of return of mMRC grade to pre- COVID - 19 baseline, PCFS grade 2, positive mental health screening (PHQ -9 or GAD -7 >9 or Trauma Screening Questionnaire oxygen desaturation 4% on STS) (table 3). Positive associations were found between PCFS grade 2, physiological impairment (4MGS <0.8 m\u00b7s1 and STS repetitions <2.5th positive mental health screening. Critical care admis sion and need for IMV were associated with physiological functional impairment. Neither worst inpatient nor follow -up RALE score were associated with any modelled outcome measure. LIMITS: not possible to do lung function on serial patients; conventional walking tests impractical; lack of standardized definition of post-COVID conditions ; single centre (Demelo - Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed Spain Observational cohort N=100 Aim: describe the long- term outcomes of COVID -19 patients with VTE and to analyze the risk factors of poor prognosis. Population: consecutive patients diagnosed with VTE during hospital admission and outpatients Mean follow -up 13.9 weeks RISK FACTORS: Development of main outcome was significantly associated with ICU admission (OR 8.437, p<0.001), anemia (OR 2.918 p0.021), thrombocytopenia (3.211 OR, p 0.025), and cancer (OR 7.187, p0.024). Risk of death or major bleeding was independently associated with ICU admission (HR 12.2; 95% CI 3.0- 48.3), thrombocytopenia 21.6; 95% CI 1.8- 259) LIMITS: Describes r isk factors for negative outcomes from COVID -19 and VTE, not other forms of post -COVID conditions . More about complication of COVID -19 vs. \"long COVID.\" (Ekbom et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed Sweden Observational cohort N=60 Aim: prevalence of respiratory impairment as measured by pulmonary function tests (PFT) and associated factors in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) -treated COVID -19 patients 3 -6 months after discharge. RISK FACTORS The most common impairment is reduced diffusing capacity, present in 45%. This risk increases wi th age above 60, need for mechanical ventilation and time in ICU . Longer stay in the ICU as well as impaired FVC (<LLN) at follow -up were also associated with impaired DLCO. All these significant relations could be confirmed after further adjusting for age. Longer stay in the ICU as well as impaired FVC (<LLN) at follow -up were also associated with impaired DLCO. Level of C -reactive protein (CRP) at admission to the ICU was lower in the group with impaired DLCO and the 73 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 same was found regarding the lowest values for blood leukocytes and lymphocytes during the ICU -period. No relationship with impaired DLCO was found for D -dimer at admission or for the maximum value during the ICU - period. All these significant relations could be confirmed after further adjust ing for age. Regarding FVC at follow - up, only severe ARDS was associated with having FVC < LLN at follow -up in a s imilar analysis . When analyzed as a continuous variable, DLCO (%predicted) at follow up was confirmed to significantly related (p < 0.05) to all variables that were significantly associat ed with impaired DLCO , with exception for CRP at admission (p = 0.11). LIMITS: small sample size, no control, selection bias (Einvik et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed Norway Cross sectional survey N=583 Aim: Determine if prevalence of symptom -defined PTSD 1.5- 6 months after COVID -19 was higher in hospitalized than non-hospitalized subjects; and, deter mine risk factors for persistent symptoms of PTSD in COVID -19 survivors Population: 17% Norwegian population (subjects of 2 parallel cohort studies); adults with positive COVID test Follow -up: 4- 8 weeks post -discharge or 1- 4 months post - diagnosis for non- hospitalized RISK FACTORS: none found In multivariable logistic regression analysis, there was no association between being hospitalized and the presence of symptom -defined PTSD (OR 0.83, p=0.667) . Being born in Norway compared to outside Norway was associated with PTSD (OR 0.40, p=0.012) None of the cohort N=1,950 Aim: resents prevalence data and associated risk factors of post-COVID -19 cough one year after hospital discharge in a sample of subjects who had survived hospitalization for COVID -19. Population: Adults hospitalized with COVID -19 in first wave of 3 hospitals in Spain Follow -up average 44.8 weeks RISK FACTORS: None found The regression model did not reveal any clinical variable associated with the presence of post -COVID -19 cough: age 95%CI 0.69-2.81, No significant association of long- term post -COVID -19 cough with hospitalization variables was either observed: the number of symptoms at hospital admission (OR1.26, 95%CI -2.69, number of Last revised: phone survey; perspectives; no diagnostics or severity; cross -sectional data (Himmels, 2021) Grey Literature Norway Review Review ( n=43 articles) Aim to gather information on patient groups most at risk of long-term effects of COVID -19, and what characterizes them. Exact studies and findings not extracted. (Hirschtick et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed USA Cross sectional survey N=593 Aim: to estimate the prevalence and correlates of post sequelae of SARS -CoV-2 infection (PASC). Population: non- institutionalized adults with COVID -19 onset during study period Follow -up average 8.6 weeks RISK FACTORS Respondents reporting very severe (vs. mild) symptoms had 2.25 times higher prevalence of 30- day COVID -19 ([aPR] 2.25, 95% CI 1.46- 3.46) and 1.71 times higher prevalence of 60- day COVID -19 (aPR 1.71, 95% 1.02- 2.88). Hospitalized (vs. non- hosp italized) respondents had about 40% higher prevalence of both 30- day (aPR 1.37, 95% CI 1.12- 1.69) and 60- day COVID -19 (aPR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02- 1.93). In unadjusted analyses, older age was statistically significantly associated with 30- day and 60- day COVID - 19 prevalence. Respondents aged 55- 64 years had 1.71 times higher prevalence of 30- day COVID -19 (Prevalence Ratio [PR] 1.71, 95% CI 1.19- 2.47) and 2.14 times higher prevalence of 60- day COVID -19 (PR 2.14, 95% CI 1.27- 3.59) relative to 18- 34 year -olds. Point estimates for respondents aged 65+ were similar to respondents aged 55- 64, though slightly lower. After adjusting for other demographic factors, pre- existing comorbidities, and illness severity, older age (45+ years) was not statistically significantly ass ociated with increased 30- day or 60- day COVID -19. Additionally, although females had a higher prevalence of 30- day and 60- day COVID -19 than males, this difference was not statistically significant . Hispanic adults had 48% higher prevalence of 30- day COVID -19 (PR 1.48, 95% CI 1.17- 1.86) and 67% higher prevalence of 60- day COVID -19 (PR 1.67, 95% CI 1.18- 2.36) than NH White adults in unadjusted models. However, there were no statistically significant differences in 30- day or 60- day COVID -19 by race/ethnicity in the adjusted models. Annual household income was a strong and significant predictor of 30- day COVID -19. Even after adjusting for demographic and clinical factors, respondents with an income less than $75,000 had about 40% higher prevalence of 30- day CO VID-19 than respondents with an income at or above $75,000 (<$35,000 aPR 1.40, 95% CI , 2021 aPR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09 -1.75). Income was not significantly associated with 60- day COVID -19 in fully adjusted models. Results from the sensitivit y analysis restricting the sample to non- hospitalized respondents were largely consistent with results from the primary analysis for 30- day COVID -19, with one exception. Although cardiovascular disease was not associated with 30- day COVID -19 among the enti re sample, non- hospitalized respondents with (vs. without) cardiovascular disease had 54% higher prevalence of 30- day COVID -19 (aPR 1.54, 95% CI 1.01- 2.34). LIMITS: skip patter means missed data; lack of diversity so underestimate socioeconomic disparities; recall and response bias; severe experiences more likely to participate (Iqbal et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed UK Systematic Review Systematic Review Aim: clarify characteristics and predictors of acute and chronic post-COVID conditions Exact studies and findings not extracted. (Islam et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed UK Observational cohort N=403 Aim: describe the variation in the risk of readmission or death within 60 days of discharge following hospitalization for COVID -19, by age, sex and ethnicity. Population: Patients discharged during 4 month period from NHS Follow -up average 8.6 weeks RISK FACTORS The st andardized incidence rate (per 100 person- months) of readmission or death within 60 days of discharge was twice as high among those aged 65 years as those < 65 years [23.4 vs 10.6; standardized incidence rate ratio 2.21 (95% CI: 1.45 -3.56)] and among women as men [34.9 vs 15.5; standardized incidence rate ratio 2.25 (1.05- 4.18)]. There was no evidence of vari ation in incidence by ethnicity . LIMITS: limited generalizability (1 region, limited diversity) (Lerum et al., 2020) Peer -reviewed Norway Observational cohort N=103 Aim describe symptoms and pulmonary function 3- months following hospital admission for COVID -19 Patients: Patients aged >18 years who had been admitted for >8 h with a discharge diagnosis Follow -up average 11.8 weeks for COVID -19 or viral pneumonia RISK FACTORS: Age per year NOT associated with dyspnea (OR 0.81, p=0.231). Age per year associated with ground glass opacities ( GGO) in chest CT (OR 1.81, p=0.004). Age per year NOT associated with parenchymal bands in chest CT (OR 1.19, p =0.376) . Male sex not associated with dyspnea (OR 0.39, p=0.69); not associated with GGO in chest CT (OR 76 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 1.25, p=0.662 ); not associated bands in chest CT ( OR 1.35, p=0.584 ). ICU survivors had similar dyspnea scores to hospitalized but non- ICU patients (OR 0.67, p=0.553), similarly for pulmonary function ( OR 1.54, p=0.517), but higher prevalence of GGO (adjusted OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.1-15.6) and lower performance in usual activities. LIMITS: possible participation bias STRENGTHS: multicenter, prospective design; age and prevalence similar between sample and population estimates; dyspnea is subjective so valuable to have diagnostic imaging. (Liang et al., 2020) Liang Peer -reviewed China Observational cohort N=67 Aim: to evaluate symptoms and lung function of COVID -19 survivors post -discharge Population: Discharged from hospital Follow -up 12 weeks RISK FACTORS: None found The characteristics of patients with or without impaired PFT at 3 -months after discharge were not statistically significant between the two groups. Multivariate analysis found that none of the prognostic factors (including age (OR 1.022, days (1.025, p=0.331) ) were significantly associated with the impaired lung function tests at 3 -months after discharge. In accordance with the ATS recommendations, 12 five patients received a bronchodilator and post - bronchodilator spirometry values were used in the analysis . LIMITS: small sample; single site; large decline rate so selection bias; some patients had no prior medical history so unclear if pre -existing or novel diagnoses (Machado et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed The Netherlands Cross sectional survey N=1,939 Population: adults with confirmed or suspected COVID -19 infection from online panel or social media groups for long- COVID 12 week follow -up Completed a battery of online surveys relating to symptoms, health- related quality of life (EQ -5D-5L), impairment in work and activities, and functional status Subjects with no functional limitations were older compared to subjects presenting slight, moderate and severe functional limitations. Subjects with severe functional limitations (Grade 4 on the PCFS Scale) presented lower BMI compar ed to all other groups . Other factors associated with poorer functional status were marital status (prevalence of category 'alone' highest in Grade 4) and presence of comorbidities (prevalence of '2 comorbidities' highest in Grade 4). Subjects with severe functional limitations also had the highest prevalence of a 'symptom -based' COVID -19 diagnosis. 77 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 All associations found significant is p<0.05 for grades 3/4 vs. 0/1/2 . Specific odds ratio not provided. (Mei et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed China Cross sectional survey N=3,677 AIM: to record and investigate possible post -COVID -19 sequelae and herd immunity Population: post -hospital discharge with confirmed COVID - 19 Follow -up average 20.6 weeks RISK FACTORS: The incidence of post -COVID -19 sequelae among elderly COVID -19 survivors ( age 60 years) was slightly increased compared to that of young COVID -19 survivors (age <60 years; relative risk = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02-1.10, p = 0.007). LIMITS: no control; not designed to determine impact of treatment (Menges et al., 2021) Preprint Switzerland Observational cohort N=431 Aim: assess prevalence of symptomatology and health care utilization at least 6 months after COVID -19 infection. Population- based prospective cohort s tudy using online survey Population: Adults with positive COVID -19 test Mean follow -up 21.7 weeks Study provides frequency of contact/utilization with the healthcare system after COVID -19 positive test. Offers some insight on risk factors for healthcare usage. RISK FACTORS: A higher percentage of female participants reported not having recovered compared to males (31% versus 21%). We observed a higher percentage of non- recovered participants among 40- 64 year -olds compared to older and younger age groups (32% versus 24% in 65 year -olds and 19% in 18- 39 year - olds). A higher percentage of initially hospitalised individuals reported not to have recovered compared to those that did not require hospitalization (36% versus 23%) . In multivariable analyses among initially symptomatic participants, we found evidence that severe to very severe symptoms during acute illness (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.34, p=0.003) and the presence of comorbidities (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.50, p=0.005) were associated with higher odds of not having recovered. Females were less likely to have recovered at 6-8 months after diagnosis compared to males (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.85, p=0.009) DYSPNEA: In multivariable analyses, we found evidence for an association of grade 1 dyspnea wit h female sex (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.87, p=0.003), initial hospitalization (OR 4.17, 95% CI 2.23 to 7.91, p<0.001) and body mass index (OR 1.14 per unit increase, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.20, p<0.001), but not with age, initial symptom severity, smoking or respiratory comorbidity 78 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 MENTAL HEALTH: The proportion of participants reporting depressive symptoms was higher in older age groups and in females. In multivariable analyses, we found no evidence for an association of depression with age, sex, initial hospitali zation, severity of symptoms at diagnosis, or the presence of comorbidities. LIMITS: testing capacity early in pandemic might mean more severely -affected population; risk of self -selection bias; lack of baseline; not all health service utilization (i.e. n o specialty use or diagnostic services); (Mermelstein et al., 2021) Preprint USA Cross sectional survey N=401 Aim: to describe the methods and results of a multipronged strategy to rapidly (over a 1 -week period) identify and enroll a diverse sample, and to characterize post -acute sequelae of COVID -19 (PASC ) in a predominantly Hispanic/Latinx and Black population in Illinois Population: Adults, self -identify as Hispanic/Latinx and Black Follow -up average 16 weeks RISK FACTORS In a multivariable logistic regression model, older age (40-59 vs. 18- adj usted odds 0.46 [95% confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.90]) and having been hospitalized with COVID -19 (vs. not hospitalized: aOR = 0.28 [0.12 to 0.64]) were independently associated with a lower likelihood of recovery within 3 months. A similar pattern was noted in participants who were age 60 years and older vs. age 18- 39 years, though differences were not significant. Participants who were hospitalized with COVID -19 were significantly less likely to return to usual health within 3 months (vs. not hospitalized: aOR 0.28, 95% CI COVID -19 positivity; no population- based sampling strategy and short window to participate so limited generalizability; (Moreno -P\u00e9rez et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed Spain Observational cohort N=277 Aim: to analyze the incidence of Post -acute COVID -19 syndrome (PCS) and its components, and to evaluate the acute infection phase associated risk factors. Population: adults with COVID -19 who attended emergency department Follow -up average 10 weeks RISK FACTORS: none foun d After multivariate adjustment, no baseline clinical features, nei ther age, sex, comorbidity, severity of acute COVID -19 infection, COVID -GRAM score, inflammatory markers, ICU -admission, hospital/ICU length of stay, or treatment behave as independent predictors of post - COVID conditions . (Osmanov et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed Russia N=518 Aim: to assess long- term outcomes in children previously hospitali zed with Covid -19 and associated risk factors. 79 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Observational cohort Population: children previously hospitali zed with Covid -19 Follow -up average 36 weeks RISK FACT ORS: Age & Allergic disease: In multivariable regression analysis, older age group was associated with persistent symptoms. When compared with children under two years of ages, those ages 6- 11 years had an odds ratio of 2.74 (95% confidence interval 1.37 to 5.75) of persistent symptoms and those 342 12- 18 years of age (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.41 to 5.4) both vs. <2 years. Another predictor associated with persistent symptoms was allergic diseases (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.67). Similar patterns were seen for children with co- existence of persistent symptoms from 2 or more categories: 6- 11 years of age (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.02 to 6.72), 12- 18 years of age (OR3.18, 95% CI 1.43 to 8.11) both vs. <2 years. Allergic disease in children were also associated with a higher risk of long COVID (O'Sullivan et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed UK Observational cohort N=155 Report early use of a rehabilitation tool for clinical practice Population: GP assesses as having acute illness with ongoing rehabilitation needs (so COVID -19 diagnosis not required); military personnel Mean 13 weeks follow -up RISK FACTORS: Patients who self -managed at home (n=100, 64.5%) were 75% less likely to receive laboratory confirmation (OR 0.25 (0.12 to 0.50), Patients admitted to hospital wards and intensive care unit were more likely to receive laboratory confirmation (OR 4.43 (1.84 to 10.63), p<0.01and OR 4.72 (1.20 to 18.56), respectively) . LIMITS: Results are highly focused on sub- analysis of patient groups who received a COVID test and those who did not, and location of acute care or no hospitalization was used as a proxy for risk. (Park et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed Korea Cross sectional survey N=10 Aim: to assess mental health in patients with COVID -19 Population: 10 patients recovering from COVID -19 pneumonia after discharge Follow -up 4 weeks RISK FACTORS: Patients with high perceived stigma (n = 4) tended to have higher scores for PTSD symptoms (their IES -R-K mean score = 16.3 vs. 3.5 in patients with low perceived stigma; P = 0.067), especially in the hyper -arousal (mean score = 4.8 vs. 0.2, P = 0.010) and numbness (mean score = 3.3 vs. 0.5, P = 0.019) domains. Survivors with a previous history of psychiatric treatment (n = 3) also had higher scores for PTSD symptoms (mean score = 20.3 vs. 3.6 in patients without a previous history of psychiatric treatment, P = 0.017); still, they did not show scores for depression and anxiety that differed significantly from survivors without such a history. 80 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 There were no significant diffe rences in the scores for depression, anxiety, or PTSD by pneumonia severity and whether their tracing routes were disclosed to the public. LIMITS: Too small of a sample to appropriately perform any quantitative analyses. Due to size of sample, not including in synthesis above.

Population: adults, admitted to hospital during study period with suspected CO VID-19 and discharged at least 90 days previous Follow -up average 31.7 weeks. 81 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 RISK FACTORS Females under the age of 50 years were five times less likely to report feeling recovered (adjusted OR 5.09, 95% CI 1.64 to 15.74), were more likely to have greater disability (adjusted OR 4.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 15.94), twice as likely to report worse fatigue (adjusted OR 2.06, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.31) and seven times more likely to become more breathless (adjusted OR 7.15, 95% CI 2.24 to 22.83) than men of the same age. LIMITS: not generalizable; selection bias; design is cohort but implementation like cross -sectional survey so difficult to make causal inferences. (Sudre et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed UK Observational cohort N=4,182 Aim: to compare users of an app based on persistence of symptoms post -COVID -19 Population: Used app when age 18 years; BMI greater than 15 and less than 55, a positive SARS -CoV-2 swab test (PCR) confirming the diagnosis of COVID -19; disease onset between 14 d before and 7 d after the test date, and before the 30 June 2020 Follow -up average 6 weeks RISK FACTORS: Individuals who reported more than five symptoms in the first week (the median number reported) were significantly more likely to go on to experience LC28, (OR 3.95 (CI 3.10- 5.04)). This strong risk factor was predictive in both sexes and in all age groups. The five symptoms experienced during the first week that were most predictive of LC28 in the individuals with COVID - 19 were: fatigue (OR 2.83 (CI 2.09 -3.83)), headache (OR 2.62 (2.04 -3.37)), dyspnea (OR 2.36 (CI 1.91 - 2.91), hoarse voice (OR 2.33 (1.88- 2.90)) and myalgi a (OR 2.22 (1.80 -2.73)). Similar pat terns were observed in both sexes. In adults aged over 70 years, loss of smell (which was generally less common in this age group) was the most predictive symptom of long COVID (OR 7.35 (CI 1.58-34.22)) before fever (OR 5.51 (CI 1.75- 1.21 -13.42). LIMITS: Selection bias as only those who contribute to an app. Self -report so recall bias. (Taquet et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed US Observational Cohort N=236,379 Aim: investigate the incidence of neurological and psychiatric diagnoses in survivors in the 6 months after documented clinical COVID -19 infection, and we compared the associated risks with those following other health conditions Population: adult COVID -19 survivors Follow -up average 24 weeks RISK FACTORS The severity of COVID -19 had a clear effect on subsequent neurological diagnoses. But the incidences and HRs of these were greater in patients who had required hospitali zation, and markedly so in those who had required ICU admission or had developed 82 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 encephalopathy , even after extensive propensity score matching for other factors (eg, age or pr evious cerebrovascular disease) (all p values <0.001). LIMITS: Focus on specific sequelae as complications rather than on symptomatology of post -COVID conditions . Size of sample queries if number of analyses led to statistical significance or if there was a statistically significant analysis. (Tudoran et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed Romania Cross sectional survey N=125 Aim: to explore cardiac function in patients not yet recovered from COVID -19 Population: aged under 55 years; patients hospitalized during the first COVID -19 outbreak for a mild/moderate form; confirmed COVID -19 diagnosis Follow -up average 8 weeks RISK FACTORS Referring to LV -GLS as the most sensitive parameter charac terizing the LV function, if we take into account only the 11 patients with impaired LV -SF, the statistical analysis by using Spearman's correlation, reveal statistically significant correlations with several inflammatory markers like Interleukin- 6, CRP, a nd with CK-MB (r = 0.88, r = 0.829, and r = 0.72, with p < 0.001, p = 0.002, and p = 0.012, respectively) and moderate ones with age, BMI, and TCT score (r = 0.69, r = 0.53, and r = 0.59 with p = 0.017, p = 0.09, and p = 0.05, respectively). A strong corr elation with MAPSE (0.85, p = 0.001) was also documented, as well as moderate ones with LVEF, RV-GLS, and TRV (r = - 0.55, r = 0.61 and r = 0.64). Considering that elevated values of E/ e' ratio were the most common finding in patients with DD, by using th e Spearman's correlation, the statistical analysis evidenced statistically significant correlation of the E e' ratio with age and BMI (r = 0.81 and r = 0.67, p < 0.001), with COVID TCT score (r = 0.79, p < 0.001), and with markers of inflammation determined at the admission in the hospital: CRP, interleukin- 6, and fibrinogen (r = 0.9 with p < 0.001, respectively r = 0.63 with p = 0.002). We evidenced moderate correlations with other parameters characterizing DD: LAVI (r = 0.77, < 0.001), = 0.47, p = 0.029), and the number of days until negativation of PCR (r = 0.7 p < 0.001). Although LVMI should be a factor that strongly influences DD, due to different limits for men and women, the correlation was not statistically significant. LIMITS: Hospitalized so not generalizable to general population. Results very specific to physiological functioning versus patient experience of symptoms, which is what primarily discussed in post COVID syndrome. Other studies have noted that physiological functioning does not predict symptomatology in post-COVID conditions . (Vanichkachorn et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed USA Observational Cohort N=100 Population: adults with positive COVID -19 test and symptoms four or more weeks after pos itive test. 83 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Aim to describe patients reporting prolonged symptoms after COVID -19 infection Description of patient population at a specialty, rehabilitation- focused outpatient clinic (COVID Activity Rehabilitation Program) Most patient presented at 12 weeks post-diagnosis Describes elements of the program, and some utilization statistics RISK FACTORS The CARP PCS population appears distinct from those who suffer more severe cases of acute SARS -CoV-2 infection. While advanced age and the presence of several c omorbidities are positively associated with increased mortality and hospitalization during acute infections, CARP patients were younger (mean age 45.4 years old + 14.2) than groups associated with severe infection, high mortality, and hospitalization. In addition, most PCS patients had no significant medical conditions prior to their SARS -CoV-2 infection, making it difficult to predict which patients may be at risk for PCS.

Does not vary with type of vaccine. No significant worsening in quality of life or mental wellbeing metrics pre- vs. post - vaccination. About 41% reported transient (<72 hour duration) systemic effects (including fever, myalgia and headache) When compared to matched unvaccinated participants from the same cohort, those who had received vaccine had a small improvement in Long COVID symptoms, with a decrease in worsening symptoms (5.6% vaccinated vs. 14.3% unvaccinated) and increase i n symptom resolution (23.2% vaccinated vs. 15.4% unvaccinated) (p=0.035). No difference in response was identified between Pfizer - BioNTech or Oxford -AstraZeneca vaccines. (Raw et al., 2021) Preprint UK Observational cohort N=974 Population: patients receiving first dose of Pfizer vaccine at 3 hospitals Aim: Determine frequency of adverse events after vaccination for patients with and without previous COVID - 19 infection Survey regarding demographics, and self -reported adverse events (nature, severity, duration and onset) Timing is self -reported, but analysis compared <24 hours vs. > 48 hours of adverse event onset Findings suggest 85 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Table 6 D. Details from Articles Informing Health Service Implications The proportion of participants reporting at least one moderate- to-severe symptom was higher in the previous COVID -19 Symptom onset was mostly within 24 hours (75%) with no onset >48 hours. After controlling for age and sex, higher symptom number (1.61 (2.26) v 0.89 (2.02) symptoms, d=0.34 [0.20- d=0.41 [0.27- 0.55], p< 0.001) with reporting previous COVID -19. Logistic regressions controlling for age and sex showed five systemic symptoms were significantly associated with previous COVID -19 status: fever ( OR 2.87, p =0.044), p =0.033). Symptom number and duration was not significantly higher in those with Long- COVID after accounting for gender and age effects and no individual symptom was significantly associated with this condition. Author Study Details (Article Type, Country, Study Design) Implications around Health Services (Al-Aly et al., 2020) Peer -reviewed USA Observational Cohort N=73,435 Secondary analysis of administrative data from Veterans' Affairs, included negative- outcome controls Population: never -hospitalized (community -only) patients who survived at least 30 days post COVID -19 diagnosis Median follow -up 18 weeks Increased novel use of medication and medical diagnoses after COVID -19 infection even when never -hospitalized. Study does not clarify what health services are used to \"get\" to those diagnoses. Observed an increased risk of the incident use of several classes of medication, including pain medications (opioid and non- opioid), antidepressant, anxiolytic, antihypertensive, antihyperlipidaemic and oral hypoglycaemic drugs and insulin. An increased risk of a broad array of specific clinical manifestations that include acute coronary disease, arrhythmias, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, memory prob lems and thromboembolic disease. The ri sk gradient that increased across the care setting of the acute COVID -19 infection from non- hospitalized individuals to those who were hospitalized, and risk 86 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 was highest in patients who were admitted to intensive care (Ayoubkhani et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed UK Observational Cohort N=47,780 Aim: Estimate excess morbidity after severe COVID -19 (hospitalized) using administrative data (retrospective, matched cohort study) Mean follow -up 20 weeks Increased rates of re- admission and new diagnoses post - discharge for severe COVID -19 hospitalization. Study does not clarify what health services are us ed to \"get\" to those diagnoses. After admission to hospital for COVID -19, 29.4 % were readmitted (compared to 9.2% of controls with similar personal and clinical characteristics in control) Diabetes, major adverse cardiovascular event, chronic kidney disease, and chronic liver disease were diagnosed after discharge in 4.9%, 4.8%, 1.5%, and 0.3% of individuals with COVID -19, respectively, occurring at rates of 127 (122 to 132) for diabetes, 126 (121 to 131) for major adverse cardiovascular event, 39 (36 to 42) for chronic kidney disease, and 7 (6 to 9) for chronic liver disease diagnoses per 1000 person years. Those with COVID -19 were diagnosed with major adverse cardiovascular event, chronic l iver disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes after discharge from hospital 3.0 (2.7 to 3.2), 2.8 (2.0 to 4.0), 1.9 (1.7 to 2.1), and 1.5 (1.4 to 1.6) times more frequently, respectively, than in the matched control group. NOTE: focus on severe COVID -19, so likely many syndromes (e.g. post -ICU syndrome) implicated in post-discharge health service use. (Banerjee et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed USA Observational Cohort N=621 Retrospective cohort Population: Adults discharged from hospital after COVID -19 pneumonia Follow -up about 4 weeks Aim: Assess outcomes post -discharge with supplemental home oxygen (and nursing education) Study details mortality and readmission rate for patients post-COVID19 who received home oxygen. Does not indicate % of overall patients who used this, just outcomes of the ones that did use home oxygen. The all -cause mortality rate was 1.3% (95% CI, 0.6% - 2.5%) and the 30- day return hospital admission rate was 8.5% (95% CI, 6.2% -10.7%) with a median follow - up time of 26 days (interquartile range, 15- 55 days). 30 days readmission: 30- day return hospital admission rate was 8.5% (95% CI, 6.2% -10.7%) stratified by those with discharged home with oxygen. The observed 30- day readmission rate for these home oxygen patients was also lower than the overall post- acute care 30- day readmission rate for DHS patients (15.2%), as reported to California Department of Health Care Services in 2020. 87 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 LIMIT: no control in this study; very short follow -up period (Bowles et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed USA Observational Cohort N=1,409 Aim: Describe home health recovery of patients with COVID -19 and risk factors associated with re- hospitalization or death Retrospective observational cohort Population: Adults with COVID -19 discharged from a short - stay acu te care hospital and admitted to home health care Mean follow -up 12 weeks Study elaborates usage of home health care services, including average visits and type of therapy used. No control comparison so difficult to predict how many will need home health c are, but for those that go it does provide insights. The 1409 patients with COVID -19 on HHC service between 1 April and 15 September 2020 received 13 926 home health visits. Most visits (76%) were in person, 16% by telephone, and 8% by tele- video. Registered nurses provided 52% of the visits, physical therapists provided 37%, and the remainder were provided by social workers and occupational and speech therapists. The patients received 11.1 visits on average (marginal means 95% CI, 10.8 to 11.4 visits). Compared with the under -65 age group, the 80- and- older group received more visits overall (11.9 [CI, 11.1 to 12.6] vs. 10.9 [CI, 10.4 to 11.4]), more in- person visits (9.1 [CI, 8.5 to 9.7] vs. 8.1 [CI, 7.7 to 8.5]), and more physical therapy visits (4.6 [CI , 4.0 to 5.1] (10% [CI, 8.1% to 11.2%]) were re- hospitalized. Only 23 patients remain on service. After an average of 32 days of care (SD, 25.7), 94% of patients with COVID -19 in home health care were discharged (n= 1319); 1241 (87%) were discharged without any adverse events (re- hospitalization or death). More than half (57%) of those re- hospitalized returned to HH C and were subsequently discharged (n= 78) (Castro -Avila et al., 2020) Peer -reviewed UK Sequential mixed - methods N=193 care staff and GPs Sequential mixed methods (online survey and interviews) Aim: Identify follow -up services available during an d after UK's first wave of COVID -19 pandemic, and views of critical care staff and GPs on patients' future needs. Population: critical care staff and GPs Study describes clinician's perspectives on changes to health service provision in first wave of COVID -19. See post-ICU and rehabilitation support important. But, no metrics on actual utilization. Most care provided virtually, but not considered adequate by staff. During first wave, f ollow -up services were offered in 80 units (71% sampled); of these, 20 reported ceasing provision and 53 modifying provision of services during the pandemic. 8 units implemented a new follow -up 88 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 service after the peak of the pandemic. Occupational therapy a nd physiotherapy were the services with the greatest increase. Over 60% of GPs were unaware of the follow -up services generally provided by their local hospitals and whether or not these were functioning during the pandemic. On average, four patients from their patients' list had been through ICU due to severe COVID -19. Physical and mental healthcare needs were ranked similarly high in terms of areas of concern with future patients recovering after a critical care stay. Interview key themes: They expected p atients with COVID -19 to suffer a longer -lasting deterioration of lung function, potential issues with renal function, a high incidence of shoulder injuries due to proning and cognitive problems related to the incidence of delirium. Before COVID -19, most I CU interviewees reported having a post -ICU follow -up service; the few who did not were planning to implement one after the pandemic. Most follow -up services were suspended during the peak of the first wave, as staff returned to in- hospital clinical duties. The few places that continued to provide such services used telephone follow -up, delivered by staff that were shielding. All unit staff we interviewed follow patients up 2- 3 months after ICU discharge, but a minority also routinely call patients weekly (I CUnurse04, North East) or monthly (ICUnurse08, East Midlands). Two ICU interviewees said that they were implementing separate clinics for patients with COVID -19 to carry out extra recommended assessments, such as a chest X -ray at 6 weeks post-discharge as recommended by the British Thoracic Society. Some ICU interviewees questioned the capacity of community rehabilitation services to improve patients' functioning. Both GPs and ICU staff felt that previous notions of thresholds for functional status post -ICU (several commented on assessments of patients climbing a flight of stairs) were arbitrary and not suitable for the wider age group of patients affected by COVID -19. Barriers to f ollow -up care service provision: funding complexities, remit and expertise, and communication between ICU and community services. (D'Cruz et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed UK Observational Cohort N=119 Aim: investigate sequelae of severe COVID -19 pneumonia (hospitalization 48hrs), and identify risk factors Prospective, single- centre observational cohort Follow -up 7-9 weeks post -discharge follow -up 89 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Population: adults discharged after severe COVID -19 pneumonia (hospitalization 48hrs) Study noted hospital service use post -discharge and found 16-40% used some services. Time frame is lacking and no controls. 57 (48%) patients used hospital services following hospital discharge: 23 (40%) attended outpatient appointments for monitoring of inpatient complications (haematology, renal, diabetes), 16 (28%) attended the emergency department, nine (16%) were re- hospitalized and nine (16%) attended planned outpatient appointments for pre -existing comorbidities. (Hassenpflug et al., 2020) Peer -reviewed USA Quality Improvement N=41 Aim: describe first series of patients with COVID -19 admitted to post -acute hospital Single -centre observational descriptive report, based on administrat ive data Median length of stay at post -acute hospital: 6 weeks Study unclear on what proportion of hospitalized patients go to post -acute hospital. Few insights on health service utilization. Of 194 patients transferred to post -acute hospital during study period, 41 (21%) were admitted for continued recovery from confirmed COVID -19 pneumonia. All mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis interventions were initiated at the transferring hospital. None of the seven patients excluded from weaning were chronically ventilated prior to admission to the transferring hospital. Upon evaluation by the consulting pulmonologist on admission to facility , patients were determined not to be weaning candidates for the following reasons: physiologic instability (unmet readiness to wean parameters), and poor mentation or neurocognitive disorders. Patient characteristics: injury stage 2. LIMITS: Small cohort, unique population, relatively short follow -up, and unclear on service utilization fully in long- term care. (Hernandez - Romieu et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed USA Observational Cohort N=3171 Aim: clarify longer -term health care utilization and clinical characteristics of non- hospitalized adults after COVID -19 diagnosis Population: non-hospitalized adults with positive COVID -19 test and 180 or more days since testing date Mean follow -up 21.7 weeks Study provides frequency of contact/utilization with the healthcare system in the 28 -180 days after COVID -19 diagnosis. Offers some insight on usage over time. 90 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Among 3,171 non -hospitalized adults who had COVID - 19, 69% had one or more outpatient visits during the follow-up period of 28- 180-days. Compared with patients without an outpatient visit, a higher percentage of those who did have an outpatient visit were aged 50 years, were women, were non- Hispanic Black, and had underlying health conditions. Among adults w ith outpatient visits, 68% had a visit for a new primary diagnosis, and 38% had a new specialist visit. Active COVID -19 diagnoses* (10%) and symptoms potentially related to COVID -19 (3% -7%) were among the top 20 new visit diagnoses; rates of visits for these diagnoses declined from 2- 24 visits per 10,000 person- days 28 -59 days after COVID -19 diagnosis to 1-4 visits per 10,000 person- days 120 -180 days after diagnosis. The presence of diagnoses of COVID -19 and related symptoms in the 28 -180 days following acute illness suggests that some non- hospitalized adults, including those with asymptomatic or mild acute illness, likely have continued health care needs months after diagnosis. Among adults with one or more outpatient visits, 7,991 visits occurred 28 -180 days after COVID -19 diagnosis, with a median of two (interquartile range = 1- 4) visits per patient . Fewer than 2% (32) of patients were hospitalized 28- 180 days after COVID -19 diagnosis. More than two thirds of patients (1,617; 68%) had visits for a new pr imary diagnosis. Among specialists visited, 1,627 (75%) patients visited a family, geriatric, or internal medicine provider, and 823 (38%) visited with a new specialist. Common new specialty visits potentially related to COVID -19 included patients saw a pulmonologist; 41 (71%) of these patients had not been evaluated by this specialty in the 12 months preceding their COVID -19 diagnosis. COVID -19-related visits declined from 24 per 10,000 person- days during the 28 -59-day interval to fewer than two per 10,000 person -days during the 120- 180- day interval. Visits per 10,000 person- days for symptoms potentially related to COVID -19 declined during these same intervals, including those for throat or chest pain (from seven per 10,000 person- days to four), shortness of breath (from eight to three), cough (from four to two), and malaise and fatigue (from four to two). In contrast, rates of visits with chroni c disease diagnoses (e.g., hypertension and diabetes) and urinary tract infections changed little over time. LIMITS: mostly privately insured population; no non- COVID -19 control group; unclear whether use of COVID -19 diagnosis visit code used by providers. (Lund et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed Denmark N=8983 91 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Observational Cohort Aim: To examine prescription drug and health -care use after SARS- CoV-2 infection not requiring hospital ization Population- based cohort study using administrative data Mean follow -up 12 weeks Study gives insights on health service utilization and compares with COVID -19 negative individuals over same period. By the end of follow -up, 6557 (73\u00b70%) of 8983 non- hospitalised 62391 (77\u00b71%) of 80894 SARS -CoV-2-negative individuals had visited their general practitioner, were seen at a hospital outpatient clinic, or were adm itted to hospital (appendix p 5). Comparing overall health- care use between SARS - CoV-2-positive and SARS -CoV-2-negative individuals, we observed increased PERR -adjusted rate ratios for general practitioner visits (1\u00b718 [95% 1\u00b722]) -1\u00b716]) among SARS- CoV-2-positive individuals. We found no material difference between cohorts for emergency department visits (1\u00b707 Among health- care users, most individuals had a single visit to the general practitioner or hospital outpatient clinic, and few individuals had fi ve or more visits . LIMITS: F ollow -up was limited to 6 months after a test for SARS- CoV-2, which might not yet account for all long-term complications and persisting symptoms after COVID -19. Information on the indication for testing was not available.

Population- based prospective cohort study using online survey Population: Adults with positive COVID -19 test Mean follow -up 21.7 weeks Study provides frequency of contac t/utilization with the healthcare system after COVID -19 positive test. Offers some insight on risk factors for healthcare usage. A total of 170 (40%) participants reported having had at least one contact with the healthcare system (i.e., re - 92 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 hospitalization , general practitioner visits, or medical hotline calls) for reasons related to COVID -19. Out of 81 individuals who were initially hospitalized due to COVID -19, eight (10%) were admitted to a hospital again at least once due to persistent symptoms or COVI D-19 related complications, with a maximum of three re- hospitalizations. More than half of the participants (n=224, 52%) reported at least one general practitioner visit for any reason, and 150 (36%) had a general practitioner visit related to COVID -19. A mong those, the median number of general practitioner visits related to COVID - 19 was 2 (IQR 1 to 3). Older individuals (53% in those aged 65 years compared to 43% in 40- 64 year -olds and 20% in 18- 39 year-olds) and those initially hospitalized (63% versus 29% in non- hospitalized) more frequently reported to have seen their general practitioner. 31 (7%) participants reported to have called a medical hotline at least once for a reason related to COVID -19, with a median of 1 call (IQR 1 to 2). Among those t hat had not fully recovered, 37 (33%) did not report further healthcare contacts . Since SARS- CoV-2 infection, a new physician- diagnosed medical condition was reported by 77 (18%) participants. 27 (35%) of these diagnoses were considered to be related to CO VID-19 by a physician. In multivariable regression analyses, we found evidence for an association between healthcare use and initial hospitalization, having experienced severe to very severe symptoms, sex, and age 40 years. Furthermore, not having fully recovered (OR 3.53, 95% CI 2.14 to 5.86, p<0.001), experiencing grade (OR 2.35, to 3.99, p<0.001), fatigue (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.50, p=0.03) and symptoms of depression (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.45, p=0.002) were independently associated with having contact with the healthcare system. LIMITS: testing capacity early in pandemic might mean more severely -affected population; risk of self -selection bias; lack of baseline; not all health service utilization (i.e. no specialty use or d iagnostic services); (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence et al., 2020) Grey Literature UK Review Review document Aim: guidance to assist healthcare systems establish and maintain post -COVID assessment services Paper provides recommendations on types of health services likely required, but nature of report means no insight on frequency of utilization. Some patients will need further therapeutic input, rehabilitation, psychological support, specialist investigation or treatment once they have been assessed, and it is the responsibility of the assessment service to refer patients on to existing services as needed, so that care is coordinated and joined -up. 93 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Advice or signposting as a one -off intervention in the assessment service may also be offered.

Expert Delphi panel provided strategies for health care providers and system, but nature of paper no exact % on implications of such recommendations on resource use. Long COVID clinics must operate in context of rapidly evolving practice amongst both GPs and specialists. Care pathways in holistic care, investigation of specific complications, management of potential symptom clusters in cardiac disease, dysautonomia and mast cell disorder, and individualized rehabilitation are needed. Long COVID alone is insufficient diagnosis unless other causes have been excluded. Require face- to-face assessment Lots of diagnostic imaging and specialty referrals are recommended for appropriate assessment. (O'Sull ivan et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed article UK Cross - sectional Survey N=155 Report early use of a rehabilitation tool for clinical practice Population: GP assesses as having acute illness with ongoing rehabilitation needs (so COVID -19 diagnosis not require d); military personnel Mean 13 weeks follow -up Narrative discussion on importance of referral to appropriate primary and/or specialty care based on principal symptoms. No empirical data on exact impacts and size of referrals, just that are likely to be som e. Given the uncertainty of the clinical course of post - COVID -19 syndrome, patients were reassured that re- referral from primary care was welcomed where necessary. Further involvement of specialist services, including dietitians, psychology or DMRC COVID -19 Recovery Service was also performed when needed. These principal symptoms should be a key consideration for the rehabilitation of individuals with post-COVID -19 syndrome. (Parkin et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed article UK N=225 Article focuses on describing a functioning, comprehensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation pathway for 94 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Descriptive patients with COVID -19 post -discharge. Eligibility included persistent symptoms 7 weeks after hospital discharge. In describing this pathway, it provided a brief description of the demographics of the population who had been supported by this pathway. Study overviews the services available and triggered by the pathway. The frequency of utilization is not elaborated in this study. The Community COVID -19 MDT pathway was established in September 2020, as part of the NHS England \"Five- point plan\" to embed post -COVID -19 syndrome assessment clinics across England.7 the establishment of a 3 tier model of post COVID management. Patients with typical symptoms lasting between 1 and 2months self -manage using the online resources outlined in Figure 1. Those who have Level 2 low/moderate complexity (such as single disci pline needs) are supported by non- COVID specific care and therapy services, such as community occupational and physiotherapy. For patients who meet the Level 1 criteria of having prolonged symptoms over 3months with a clear need for more than 1 specialist role are eligible for referral into the Community COVID -19 MDT. The Level 1 Community COVID -19 MDT consists of 2 Allied Health Professional (AHP) Pathway Co- ordinators, 2 Physiotherapists, 2 Occupational Therapists, and 3 Consultants with specialisms in Rehabilitation Medicine, Respiratory Medicine and Cardiology; with specialist support from a Respiratory nurse, Respiratory Physiotherapists, 2 Dieticians, and 2 Neurological Occupational Therapists Where patients present with complex symptoms of cognitive communication or voice and upper airways disorders such as Inducible Laryngeal Obstruction, referrals are made to the Community Speech and Swallow service or the Acute Trust Specialist ENT Speech and Language therapy team. There are also referral pathways from the Community COVID -19 MDT to established local mental health and psychology services for patients who are experiencing distressing thoughts and feelings that impact on their participation of valued activities and/or roles. Article describes referral process and assessment. A traditional pulmonary rehabilitation approach is not taken by the team due to the predominance of fatigue in many cases, taking caution from the experience of those with chronic fatigue syndrome, in which incremental exercise programs are advised against. Those patients who require consideration of ambulatory oxygen are assessed as per British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines. Interventions are led by the patient's functional priorities and presenting 95 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 symptoms, following the usua l process of assessment, clinical reasoning and intervention planning. No comparison and more descriptive study, so cannot speak definitively to impact or implications. (Research, 2021) Grey Literature Canada Review Review Aim: to summarize evidence on Long COVID, including definitions, risk factors, symptomatology, prognosis, therapeutics, and other emerging research findings Review gives general advice on health service implications. Research suggests that treating people with long COVID requires a multidisciplinary approach including evaluation, symptomatic treatment, treatment of underlying problems, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and psychological support. Some recommendations on management, with follow - up being most indicative of what health services may be required. But, no clarity on whether a chronic disease model or time- limited condition is at issue herein: Treatment of Minor Symptoms: Cough, pain, myalgia can be treated symptomatically with paracetamol (i.e., acetaminophen), cough suppressants, and oral antibiotics (if secondary bacterial infection is suspected) Etiology: Etiology behind the symptoms, if any, like pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, coronary artery disease, has to be treated as per the standard protocol; chest physiotherapy and neuro rehabilitation is important in patients with pulmonar y and neuromuscular sequelae. Follow -up: The ideal frequency and duration of follow up i s not clearly defined. In people with COVID -19 interstitial pneumonia, in the first 12 months, seven interactions with health care professionals (four face- to-face) are recommended, alongside four high- resolution CT scans, four six - minute walk tests (6MWT) ; four blood tests (including blood count and metabolic panel); and two SARS- CoV-2-IgG tests (i.e., antibody tests). Social and Economic Impact: As the disease continues to spread, more people may need health care support in the future, which could put more demand on the health care system. Clear guidelines regarding management of long COVID may help clear confusion among health care providers . (Vaes et al., 2021) Peer -reviewed article Belgium Cross - sectional Survey N=1556 Surveys looking at symptoms, quality of life, functional status and work productivity at 6 months follow -up after onset COVID -19 symptoms. Follow -up at 12 and 24 weeks post -onset of acute COVID - 19 symptoms Population: membership on online peer support for long COVID (social media) Self-reported health service utilization 96 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 The proportion of patients receiving physiotherapy or rehabilitation bet ween 3 and 6 months of follow -up was significantly higher compared to the period from the infection to 3 months of follow -up (61.9% versus 31.8% and 11.7% versus 4.2%, respectively, p<0.001). After the onset of COVID -19 related symptoms, patients receiving physiotherapy reported more symptoms (6 vs. 4, p<0.05) and a worse self -reported health (84.5% good vs. 91.7% good, p<0.05) , work productivity, functional status (grade 2.6 vs. 2.0, p<0.05) and quality of life (0.613 vs. 0.706 mean index EQ-5D-5L, p<0.05) compared to patients who did not receive physiotherapy or rehabilitation. Similar differences found at 6 months (all p<0.05). Between 3 and 6 months of follow -up, significant improvements were found in both patients who did and did not receive physiothera py or rehabilitation.

The hospitalized group utilized more healthcare (including GP visits, referrals, emergency department , hospitalization) than the community group post - COVID -19, with a 2.7- fold difference in rates per 100,000 person- weeks [95%CI] between groups (52,775 [50,570 to 55,105] v. [19,142 to 19,673]) in hospitalized and community groups , respectively. Regarding utilization among the 6 and 12 months prior, healthcare utilization increased in both groups post-COVID -19 relative to pre- pandemic levels, this was much higher in the hospitalized group (61.2% increase v. 28.5%). Healthcare util ization was lower 6 months prior relative to other time- points for each group. (World Health Organization, 2021b) Grey literature article Denmark Review Policy br ief, provides a review of larger population -based studies of the various approaches taken across multiple countries to best define, understand, and provide care for post-COVID conditions . A review that touches on health system implications in caring for patients with post -COVID conditions , specifically the persistent symptoms: Survey of UK general practitioners in 2020 found that 67% were looking after patients with COVID -19 symptoms lasting longer than 12 weeks . Only 23% had access to a Long COVID clinic that they could refer into (Royal College of General Practitioners, 2020). Recommendations on model of care for post -COVID conditions should include multidisciplinary assessment services ; should bring together physicians with expertise in different body systems, as well as multidisciplinary rehabilitation services, with core teams that could include, but not be limited to, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, clinical psychology and psychiat ry, and rehabilitation medicine. These services should be part of a model of care that includes integrated referral patterns between primary, secondary and community care. Recommended process includes: an initial assessment should be undertaken in primary or secondary care to exclude serious underlying pathology, using a screening tool included in the documentation. Onward referral would then be negotiated by a single point of access to triage and refer on to one or more of three possible pathways for thos e whose symptoms persist beyond 12 weeks: post -COVID assessment clinics, local rehabilitation clinics or online self -management resources. 98 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 (Wildwing & Holt, 2021) Peer -reviewed UK Systematic Review Systematic Review (n=45 studies) Aim: systematic review of reviews of neurological symptoms of COVID -19 and implications for health care services Review speaks to likely but hypothetical needs of patients with post-COVID conditions . No empirical data. This review highlight the impact that short - and long- term neurological sy mptoms of COVID -19 may have on current health services. Symptoms seen in Long Covid such as facial pain, muscle issues, neuralgia, fatigue and insomnia, may become long term and disabling, requiring sustained support from healthcare services such as pain- , fatigue- and sleep- clinics, neurological services and primary care. Neurological symptoms of Long Covid may increase demand for already overstretched consultant -led neurological services clinics and may indicate a need for more qualified health professionals and specialists in neurology. The effects of COVID -19 on these services is hard to predict, as the neuropathy, myopathy and sensory deficits of SARS resolv ed within 3 months of recovery. However, as COVID -19 appears to be becoming Long Covid for up to 10% of patients, support is likely to be required, potentially for a significant number of people, if their symptoms do not resolve spontaneously. (Yong, 2020) Peer -reviewed Malaysia Review Narrative r eview Focus on pathophysiology, risk factors and treatments in long COVID Literature review describes broad need for rehabilitation for long COVID, but that has to be personalized to this condition and these patients. No empirical data, more recommendations. No data on size/frequency of this utilization. According to reviews, in rehabilitation, patients are advised t o perform light aerobic exercise paced according to individual capacity. Exercise difficulty levels are increased gradually within tolerated levels until improvements in fatigue and dyspnoea are seen, typically four to six weeks. Rehabilitation also includes breathing exercises that aim to control slow, deep breaths to strengthen respiratory muscles' efficiency, especially the diaphragm. The breath should be inhaled through the nose, expanding the abdominal region, and exhaled via the mouth. Such light aerobic and breathing exercises should be performed daily in 5-10min sessions throughout the day. Complementary behavioural modification and psychological support may also help improve survivors' well -being and mental health. Reviews have also recommended that rehabilitation programs be personalized since long COVID manifestation and pathophysiology may vary in each case. 99 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 Table 6 E. Details from Articles Informing Return to Work Implications Risks of physical rehabilitation must also be considered. Systematic and scoping reviews have identified that rehabilitation may not be suit able for survivors of critical COVID -19 with severe pulmonary or cardiac damage. Hence, exclusion criteria for post - COVID -19 rehabilitation have been proposed: high resting heart rate (>100 beats/min), low or high blood pressure (<90/60 or>140/90mmHg), l ow blood oxygen saturation (<95%), or other conditions where exercise is a contraindication. Indeed, an international survey study found that 85.9% of participants with long COVID experienced symptom relapse following mental or physical activities. Author Study Details (Article Type, Country, Study Design) Return to Work Implications (Davis et al., 2021) Preprint UK Cross - sectional Survey N=3,762 Population: adults with confirmed or suspected COVID -19 infection Online survey at mean 28 weeks post -diagnosis International study using social media, with more than 56 countries represented. Study demonstrated impact on return to work, absenteeism and presenteeism. 68.9% of unrecovered respondents reported reduced work hours or not working at all as a direct result of their COVID -19 illness, and on average the unrecovered group felt they were less than 60% returned to their pre- illness baseline. 27.3% [95%CI 25.3- 39.4%] of unrecovered respondents who worked before ill ness were working as many hours as prior to becoming ill at the time of survey ( 23.3% [95%CI 21.3- 25.4% ] not working as direct result of illness. This included being on sick leave, disability leave, being fired, quitting, and being unable to find a job that would accommodate them. 45.2% (42.9% to 47.2%) of respondents reported requi ring a reduced work schedule compared to pre- illness. 22.3% [95%CI 20.5-24.3%] were not working at the time of survey due to their health conditions. At least 45% of working respondents were working remotely, which they indicated was critical to their continued ability to work.

Preprint UK Modified Delphi N=33 Population: UK physicians using a social media platform specific to physicians interested in long COVID Aim: Get consensus on physicians on recognition, diagnosis and management of post -COVID conditions Delphi process included 2 online surveys. Expert Delphi panel provided strategies for employers and health care providers , including Employers should discuss with their employee suitable adjustments to aid a return to work, and both parties should be provided with written advice such as the leaflet \" COVID -19 return to work guide for recovering workers\" by the Society of Occupational Medicine. The relapsing- remitting nature of the illness needs to be emphasized as employer pressure may result in patients returning to work too soon. The onus is on the doctor with current clinical responsibility for the patient to complete the fit note; this includes secondary care doctors. The content of the fit note should be agreed between the patient and doctor, including a \"medically - recognized diagnosis\". For NHS staff to receive \"COVID pay\" during absence, the fit note must mention COVID . The ability to return to work after illness is a marker of recovery and clinicians must, therefore, record work status in the clinical notes in situations of chronic ill - health. From a public health perspective, counting days lost to sickness and lost income on account of long COVID is esse ntial.

Higher sick leave levels in those testing positive vs. negative. More sick leave of employees testing positive, compared to those testing negative, for ~2 months after infection for young and older men. Employees testing positive had a sick leave of 2.5% in 3 months before testing positive; increasing to 28.5% in the test week; dropped to pre-testing levels at month 3 (2.8%) and 4 (2.2%) after testing. Employees testing negativ e had 2.0% sick leave in the 3 months before testing, increasing to 9.0% in test week, and returning toward pre- testing level in month 3 (2.6%) and 4 (2.5 %) after testing. Aside from the couple of months around testing, sick leave remains s imilar from bef ore testing (2.5% ) to 5- 6 months after testing (2.4% ) for those who tested positive, but in line with the overall increase in sick leave in Norway during the pandemic . 102 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 For women, the excessive sick leave of those testing positive (compared to those testing negative) depended on age.

Since this review was framed as an update, KRS searched databases for articles published from November 4, 2020 to December 31, 2021 . The librarian conducted the searches on May 24 and 28th, 2021. The searched databases included: Medline (OVID), Embase, APA PsycInfo, PubMed, TRIP Pro, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, WHO Global Research Database on COVID -19, National Institute of Health and Care Exc ellence (NICE), Google, and Google Scholar. The previous was completed on November 3, 2020. The search strategy is included below. Briefly, the s earch strategy involved combinations of keywords and subject headings including: \"COVID - 19\" and \"long- term.\" Because of the diversity of questions in this review, the literature search strategy was very broad, and the screening process determined inclusion as relating to the research questions. Articles identified by KRS in their search were initially screened by title against the inclusion/exc lusion criteria listed in Table 7 below. 389 articles were identified by KRS with references and abstracts provided for further review. 29 additional articles were identified ad hoc . 418 articles were each independently screened by two reviewers using the title and abstract. 269 articles were excluded based on information in the title and abstract. Of the 149 articles that went to full -text screening, 82 were excluded by consensus of two independent reviewers . The reasons f or exclusion were not in English language (n=5), wrong type of article (e. g. editorial, protocol) (n=15), wrong population (n=11), and wrong content (i.e. inapplicable to the research questions) (n= 51) (Figure ? for PRISMA table) (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman, & PRISMA Group, 2009) .

PLoS Med 6(7): e1000097. doi:10.1371/journal. pmed1000097 Critical Evaluation of the Evidence Exclusion criteria for study quality were adapted from the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) (Hong et al., 2018). Potential articles were evaluated on three criteria: 1) Peer reviewed or from a reputable 106 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 source; 2) Clear research question or issue; 3) Whether the presented data/evidence is appropriate to address the research question. Preprints and non- peer-reviewed literature (such as commentaries and letters from credible journals) are not excluded out of hand due to the novelty of COVID -19 and the speed with which new evidence is available. Table 8 below is a narrative summary of the body of evidence included in this review. The categories, format, and suggested information for inclusion were adapted from the Oxford Centre for Evidence- Based Medicine, the Cochrane Library, and the AGREE Trust et al., et al., 2020) . Table 8. Narrative overview of the l iterature included in this review. Description Volume 1 systematic review was included, 29 observational cohort studies were included ( 7 were pre- review), 11 cross sectional survey studies were included ( 3 were pre- review), 14 review articles (including narratives style reviews) were included ( 1 was pre-review), 1 quality improvement report was included, and 7 other style of reports and articles were included (1 was pre- review). Quality The body of evidence varied greatly with the question at issue. This review included 7 distinct topics: terminology, screening tools, symptoms, risk factors, vaccination impact, health service utilization, and return to work implications. The quality of evidence on question of symptoms is addressed in the PHAC review, as summarized above. We used the adapted MMAT to assess the quality of the article as whole (Hong et al., 2018). A ccording to this adapted tool, 44 articles were of high quality, 9 were of moderate quality and 13 were of low qu ality. This tool does not capture the full nuances of the literature and the opportunities for bias. The literature on risk factors was the most robust and informative. The literature on vaccination impact, health services utilization and return to work im plications was less robust. While there were 15 review articles, only one was a rigourous systematic review and most did not detail their search strategies. This introduces concerns on the ability of those studies to unbiasedly inform the questions at is sue. For the observation studies, whether observational cohorts or cross sectional surveys, there were several common concerns. First, some studies framed their design as an observational cohort but lacked any longitudinal features in implementation and w ere in fact cross sectional in design. Due to time constraints, we listed the design as proclaimed by the authors. A challenge in synthesizing the articles was the variation in defining the phenomena and the \"starting point\" of the follow -up time period. I mplications vary greatly between follow -up that starts at symptoms onset or diagnosis, versus those t hat start at time of discharge. In the empirical studies, recall and selection bias were common concerns. For the latter, recruitment techniques did not favour generalizability with no study using a randomization approach. Some studies were site- specific, while others looked across a few hospitals and few considered population- level databases. Studies generally used convenience sampling or a sequential approach to participant recruitment/inclusion. Many studies relied on self -report, which is susceptible to recall bias. This is especially concerning for the few studies that used social media for recruitment, as only technologically - savvy individuals are r ecruited. Conversely, studies that used large administrative 107 Last revised: July 12 , 2021 databases faced concerns on data accuracy. Only one study specifically targeted persons from minority communities, which queries the accuracy findings related to ethnicity and diversity as the ot her studies may not be representative enough in that regard. Few studies had contemporaneous control groups, as found in the separate PHAC review. Potential confounding factors that limit any insight into causation include presence of pre- existing symptoms or conditions prior to COVID -19, treatment effects, impact of hospitalization or ICU admission, and the effects of the novel, global pandemic itself (e.g. barriers to care, psychosocial impacts). There was great variability in the sample sizes, and this corresponding to the heterogeneous data collection techniques: survey, administrative data, social media activity. The smallest sample size was 10 and the largest was 740,182. The median sample size was 417, which is relatively robust. The grey literature was from reputable sources, and can be used to inform other jurisdictions' perceptions and approaches to the topics of these questions. Applicability No evidence was identified from Alberta. Only 3 studies were from Canada, and they were all narrative reviews, which did not inform an empirical insights into any relevant questions. The included articles were mostly from the UK, which has a comparable population and health system. Most articles, except for a minority, were from Western industrialized countries in North America and Europe. The study evidence is applicable to the review questions, with some questions have literature of more alignment than others. Consistency The consistency of the evidence varies by question, with only the risk factor data being relatively consistent.
