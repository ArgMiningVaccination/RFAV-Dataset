The remainder (\u00a31 billion) isspent on directly funded health services (\u00a30.7 billion) and the Department'sadministration (\u00a30.3 billion). 2 Part of these funds is spent on the procurement of vaccines - in 2001-02,\u00a3195 million. Of this, the Department's national vaccine programme costs\u00a383 million. In addition, General Practitioners purchase vaccines to meet localneeds, such as the influenza vaccine for patients in 'at risk' groups. NHS trustsalso purchase a limited amount of vaccine via national pharmaceuticalcontracts for the immunisation of staff or patients considered to be 'at risk'. 3 In April 2002, the Department contracted with PowderJect PharmaceuticalsPLC for the supply of 20 million doses of smallpox vaccine. This was a jointcontract with the Ministry of Defence, costing \u00a332.5 million excluding valueadded tax. The Department used the exemptions allowable under EuropeanUnion (EU) regulations and the Public Supply Contracts Regulations 1995 ongrounds of national security, enabling it to adopt confidential procurementprocedures to purchase these supplies. 4 Following Parliamentary and media concerns about possible links betweendonations made by the Chief Executive of PowderJect to the Labour Party andthe award of the contract, we examined the robustness of the Department'sarrangements for buying vaccines (Part 3 of this report), including smallpox,within the context of their central purchasing arrangements (Part 2). Our methodology is summarised in paragraph 1.9. 5 We did not question the choice of particular strains of vaccines, since these are matters of clinical, and in case of medical countermeasures against bio-terrorism, national security judgements. Nor did we look at procurementarrangements in NHS organisations, since the Audit Commission examinedprocurement arrangements in acute hospital trusts in 2002, in its reportProcurement and Supply . In this section Introduction and scope 1 On the Department's 2 general procurement arrangements On the procurement 3 of vaccinesOn the procurement 5 of smallpox vaccine Recommendations 6PROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH On the Department's general procurement arrangements 6 The Department and the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency (the Agency) buy goods and services under EU procurement directives. They have issuedguidance to staff on procurement practices, and this incorporates key elementsof guidance issued by the Office of Government Commerce on the applicationof EU rules, the need for competition and securing value for money. 7 The Department and Agency use EU restricted procedure as the norm for mostroutine UK public sector procurements because it limits the number ofsuppliers invited to submit a full tender to those most likely to meetrequirements and avoids burdening commercial suppliers with unnecessary tender costs. Sixty per cent of all public sector procurements used restrictedprocedures in 2001 and open procedures were used in over 20% of cases. For vaccine contracts, half followed restricted procedures and over a third open procedures. 8 The Department's procurement arrangements are highly devolved, and arecurrently being strengthened and improved following recommendations in2000 from Internal Audit and in 2001 by an independent external review. Theyboth identified areas requiring attention including better central co-ordination,ensuring consistent application of procurement practices and compliance with guidance, better resourcing of the Department's Procurement PolicyAdvisory Unit, and setting up effective monitoring and managementinformation systems to provide readily available data on what was being spentwith a particular supplier. 9 The external review also concluded that a more effective and better co-ordinated procurement operation should be able to achieve value formoney improvements of between 2.5 and 3 per cent of the spend over whichthe Department has influence. This could be in the form of improved quality, orcash savings of up to \u00a35-6 million a year on commercial spend of \u00a3200 million. 10 In October 2002, the Department commissioned a more fundamental reviewof its procurement arrangements. This was completed in March 2003. TheDirector of Finance and Investment and the Permanent Secretary are currentlyconsidering the review's recommendations on the future procurementstructure, resourcing of a Commercial Division, including its relationship withthe NHS, and a job and person specification of a Commercial Director. summary and recommendations 2Measles viruses Anthrax bacteria sporesPROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 11 Given our focus on vaccine procurement, we did not examine in depth the procurement systems and arrangements in the Agency. However, the Agencyhas identified weaknesses in its contract management, including a lack ofinformation routinely available on its contract portfolio and contract usage byNHS organisations, and lack of a single supply database. Consequently, theAgency is not easily able to analyse information to improve its negotiatingposition with major suppliers nor adequately monitor its procurementactivities. The Agency is in the process of acquiring a single contractmanagement system that will address these issues. This new system is expectedto be implemented in April 2003. On the procurement of vaccines 12 The Department buys vaccines, such as Polio and Meningitis C, for its nationalvaccination programme and supplies as a contingency measure to protectagainst suppliers failing to deliver, for example, in the case of the Influenzavaccine in 2001-02 and 2002-03. In addition, it purchases supplies to addressactual or potential emergencies, such as smallpox and anthrax ascountermeasures to bio-terrorism. 13 The Agency plays a key role in the tendering and contracting process forchildhood vaccines, but the procurement of the first tranche of smallpoxvaccine was arranged in-house by the Department's Communicable DiseaseBranch with advice provided by the Procurement Policy Advisory Unit. TheAgency is, however, undertaking the procurement exercise for the secondtranche of the vaccine. 14 The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), a Non-Departmental Public Body, advises the Secretaries of State for Health, Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland on matters relating to communicable diseases,preventable and potentially preventable through immunisation. TheCommittee's remit covers routine as well as specific matters and, in formulatingadvice and recommendations, it considers the need for and impact of vaccines,their quality and strategies to ensure maximum benefit from their mostappropriate use. A sub-group of experts under the auspices of the JCVI playedan important part in the decision to purchase smallpox vaccine and in thechoice of the Lister strain. 3summary and recommendationsPowderJect Pharmaceuticals plc laboratory Patient being given smallpox vaccination Photograph: Courtesy of PowderJect4summary and recommendationsPROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 15 For the vaccine contracts that we examined, the Department acted properly in awarding these contracts by complying with appropriate EU procurementregulations, encouraging sufficient competition and evaluating tenders fairly. Theprocurement arrangements for emergency supplies of smallpox vaccine wereunusual as the Department chose not to adopt standard competitive proceduresfor national security reasons, which is allowable under EU regulations. 16 For both low dose diphtheria and anthrax vaccines, the Department holds theMarket Authorisations (product licences) and the manufacturers are named on thelicences. Therefore, full EU procedures, including advertisement in the OfficialJournal of the European Community (OJEC), were not appropriate, although themarket was tested in the case of low dose diphtheria. Anthrax was purchaseddirectly from the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research (the executive armof the Microbiological Research Authority, a Special Health Authority). 17 Generally, costs are secondary to public health and national priority issues. Thisis particularly the case for vaccines purchased for emergencies, for example thepurchase of smallpox and anthrax vaccines, where national priorities areparamount. Submissions are made to Ministers setting out the risks to publichealth of not purchasing, quantities needed, costs, and funding arrangements. 18 All vaccines routinely administered in the UK are required to have a MarketingAuthorisation (product licence) valid in the UK. All the vaccines we examinedhad this, with the exception of smallpox. All vaccines carry risks to thereceipient when administered and could lead to the manufacturer being suedfor damages. As the smallpox vaccine was unlicensed, the Department borethis risk by indemnifying PowderJect for up to \u00a330 million against damages andnotified the Committee of Public Accounts of this contingent liability on26th March 2002. 19 Ensuring competition in the vaccine market is difficult in view of the limitednumber of suppliers resulting in few expressions of interest in each contractadvertised and there is a risk of relatively higher prices as there are nearmonopolistic conditions for some vaccines. The main reasons for the narrowmarket relate to the high and increasing cost of vaccine development andproduction, mergers of manufacturers and the relatively low profit marginscompared with other pharmaceutical products. 20 The limited number of vaccine manufacturers and the complex manufacturingprocess has resulted in shortages of supply of certain vaccines. For example, inthe UK, shortages have been experienced for vaccines such as the Measles,Mumps and Rubella (MMR), Bacillus Pertussis (Hib/DTwP). Production problemsincluding batch failures are common reasons. Recovery from a major batchfailure may take months and, with the increasing centralisation ofmanufacturing, can rapidly lead to an international vaccine shortage. 21 The Department's strategy to deal with potential supply shortages has been toaward contracts to more than one supplier where possible. For example, inDecember 2002, the Department placed a contract for the supply of the MMRvaccine with the only two suppliers with Market Authorisations (productlicences) valid in the UK - Aventis Pasteur MSD and GlaxoSmithKline - toensure continuity of supply. This prudent approach enabled supplies to be metwhen, due to production problems and international demand, Aventis rationedtheir supply to each country and the Department obtained an increasedproportion of their needs from the other supplier. 5summary and recommendationsPROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH On the procurement of smallpox vaccine 22 Decisions on the strain of vaccine to purchase, speed of delivery, and security of supply (a preference for a UK manufacturing company was initially stated byMinisters), together with the small number of companies operating in thismarket, limited the number of suppliers able to compete for this contract. 23 The choice of vaccine strain was crucial. A specially convened sub-group ofexperts, set up under the auspices of the JCVI, concluded that the Departmentshould buy the Lister strain although there was no real difference between itsefficacy and that of the New York City Board of Health strain. The Lister strainwas chosen because it was preferred by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) onintelligence grounds, was proved to be effective in protecting people againstsmallpox in Africa and India in the 1970s, and was used by the Israeli military.Moreover, using a different strain from that used in the United States offered thegreatest safeguard by ensuring that the alternative strain could act as a fallback. 24 The Department used the exemptions available under EU rules to conduct aconfidential procurement process. It used this route so as not to reveal any UKvulnerabilities in its bio-terrorist strategy that might be valuable to potentialterrorists. For example, disclosure could alarm the public at a time when therewas a heightened risk of terrorism and provide terrorists with information onthe number of doses being purchased and where they would be stored. 25 Nevertheless, the Department went further by seeking to establish a degree ofcompetition by exploring with a number of companies whether they couldmeet its requirements. It held confidential meetings in January and February 2002 with five potential suppliers with a UK or European basedmanufacturing capability. In the event, only PowderJect could supply therequired doses against the Department's criteria in the time-scale specified, butonly through its partnership with Bavarian Nordic based in Germany. TheDepartment signed a contract with PowderJect in April 2002. 26 The suppliers consulted told us that they considered that the procurementprocess was not transparent. The Department did not reveal to the companiesthe procurement criteria or timelines. For example, the Department did notclearly indicate that supplies were required in 2002, or that it was willing toaccept an unlicensed product. Hence the prices quoted by some of thecompanies included licensing and clinical trial costs. Nor did the Departmentclearly specify that it was interested in the Lister strain only (since they used theterms \"preferred\" or \"favoured\" throughout the procurement process) and thismisled them. Consequently, the suppliers felt that their proposals, at theconfidential meetings and subsequently, were based on limited information onprocurement criteria, timescales, scope of the contract and the strain of vaccine. 27 The Department's view is that they were consistent in the information that theyprovided to each company and gave as complete information as they felt ableto give under the circumstances. The Department recognises that there mayhave been a mismatch between the information provided and the interpretationof this by the companies and this arises because of the unusual nature of thisprocurement as highlighted in paragraph 24. 28 The appointment of PowderJect, linked with the Department's decision not toreveal details of the procurement to the public, also raised concerns amongstsome suppliers, in Parliament and the media about propriety. Donations weremade by the Chief Executive and Chairman of PowderJect, Dr Paul Drayson, tothe Labour Party in July 2001 and January 2002 (\u00a350,000 each), the second ofwhich coincided with the timing of the smallpox procurement exercise. It was 6summary and recommendationsPROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH between 7 January to 18 February that officials shortlisted companies, set procurement criteria, held confidential meetings with companies, assessed thecompanies and prepared a submission to the Minister recommending PowderJect. 29 The officials involved, including the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, confirmed tous that they first knew of the donations on 18 February 2002 when the Minister'sprivate office informed them having seen their submission to the Minister. It wasthen that the Minister's private secretary made the connection between thecompany recommended and recent media reports (on 17 February 2002) aboutthe donations. This was after the procurement assessment had been completed andthe supplier selected by officials. Furthermore, having been made aware of thesedonations, the Minister, proceeded carefully taking account of the possiblesensitivities that might be associated with the award of the contract to PowderJect,required the Permanent Secretary to examine the officials' proposal. ThePermanent Secretary endorsed the recommendation on the grounds that in theshort-term the only source of the cell derived Lister strain smallpox vaccine in theUK was from PowderJect. The key factors in award of the contract, therefore, werethe Lister strain, speed of delivery and national security issues. 30 Although price was not the key criteria in the Department's decision to appointPowderJect, PowderJect did offer one of the lowest quotes. However, eachsupplier's quote was different in terms of vaccine strain and type and theelements of costs included. Prices were therefore not directly comparable. 31 For the second procurement exercise, announced in October 2002, theDepartment used the normal EU restricted procedure, because it consideredthat this could be done without compromising national security, theprocurement of supplies was less urgent, and wanted a more transparentprocess. Five companies expressed an interest and all were invited to tender.Three bids were received on 1 April 2003, the deadline for submissions. Recommendations 32 The Department should: (i) give greater priority to strengthening its general procurement arrangements. Addressing the concerns raised by Internal Audit in 2000 and the external review in 2001, would improve compliance with good practice, put in placeeffective monitoring arrangements and enable the early identification ofemerging problems, improve central management and information systemsand offer the prospect of significant financial savings. (ii) look at ways, such as its website, to make more widely available the process of vaccine procurement and the criteria required for contract award. EU Directives prohibit discriminatory specifications, which would include theobligation to issue invitations to, and consider offers from, suppliers in otherMember States. Information on the procurement process is already availablepublicly via OJEC but this is unlikely to be readily available to members of the public who want information on how the Department obtains vaccines for routine use. (iii) develop protocols in relation to procurements addressing specific threats, including guidance specifying when the national security over-ride should beconsidered. This would increase public and supplier confidence in theDepartment's arrangements and introduce greater transparency. (iv) consider the need for a more proactive approach, including a long-term strategy, to address the threat of supply shortages for some vaccines given thelimited and continuously decreasing vaccine market, to minimise disruption toimmunisation programmes and the public health consequences.Part 1PROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH Background and introduction 7part one1.1 The Department of Health (the Department) has an annual budget of \u00a354 billion (2002-03). The majority funds NHS hospital and community healthservices (\u00a348 billion) and payments for family healthservices to General Practitioners, opticians anddentists and prescription charges (\u00a35 billion). The remainder (\u00a31 billion) is spent on directly fundedhealth services (\u00a30.7 billion) and the Department'sadministration (\u00a30.3 billion). Each year, the NHS in England spends over \u00a313 billion on goods and services procuredfrom the private sector 1.2 Of the total annual expenditure, the NHS spends over \u00a313 billion on goods and services, ranging from complex medical diagnostic equipment to examinationgloves and stationery. The majority is spent by NHSorganisations, mainly NHS acute trusts. They dealdirectly with suppliers for most of their procurement,but some purchases are through the NHS Purchasingand Supply Agency (the Agency), an executive agency ofthe Department. One of the Agency's core functions isto negotiate national framework contracts on behalf ofthe NHS, ensuring good practice, compliance withEuropean Union (EU) regulations and economies ofscale. The Department also uses the Agency to procurevaccines as part of its routine vaccination programme.The Agency manages some 3,000 national contracts andcurrently influences around \u00a34.8 billion (37% of totalprocurement expenditure) of NHS expenditure oncommercial procurement each year (Annex A) . 1.3 The Department itself spends some \u00a3367 million a year on commercial contracts and deals with around1,700 suppliers.Each year the Department and the NHS in England spend some \u00a3195 million on routinevaccine procurement 1.4 In 2001-02, total expenditure on vaccine procurement was \u00a3195 million. Of this, the Department's national vaccine programme costs \u00a383 million. In addition,General Practitioners purchased vaccines to meet localneeds, such as the influenza vaccine for patients in 'at risk' groups. NHS trusts also purchased a limitedamount of vaccine via national pharmaceuticalcontracts for the immunisation of staff or patientsconsidered to be 'at risk', Figure 1 .

This was a jointcontract with the Ministry of Defence and the contractvalue was \u00a332.5 million excluding value added tax. TheDepartment used the exemptions allowable under EUprocurement regulations and the Public SupplyContracts Regulations 1995 on grounds of nationalsecurity, enabling it to use confidential procedures topurchase this vaccine. 1.6 Following Parliamentary and media concerns about possible links between the Chief Executive ofPowderJect's donations to the Labour Party and theaward of the contract, we examined whether theDepartment acted properly in awarding this contract toPowderJect. Furthermore, we examined the robustnessof the Department's arrangements for the purchase ofvaccines (Part 3 of this report), within the context of theircentral purchasing arrangements (Part 2). This includedwhether there was compliance with statutorycompetition and EU procurement regulations. 1.7 We did not question the choice of particular strains of vaccines, since these are matters of clinical, and insome cases, national security judgements. Nor did welook at procurement arrangements in NHSorganisations, since the Audit Commission examinedprocurement arrangements in acute hospital trusts in2002, in its report Procurement and Supply . 1.8 Finally, we did not examine the purchase of travel vaccines because, although they are part of theDepartment's national immunisation policy, they are notpart of the centrally funded childhood programme and,therefore, the vaccines are not procured centrally.Methodology 1.9 We used a variety of methods to examine these issues. We: !Interviewed key personnel in the Department andthe Agency responsible for procurement policy andarrangements, vaccine policy, and public healthissues. At the Agency we also held discussions withkey buyers. !Examined other reports on the Department'sprocurement procedures. !Developed, using EU and Treasury procurementrules, criteria for assessing vaccine procurementcontracts, and tested all current vaccine contractsagainst these criteria, based on file examination atthe Department and the Agency. !Consulted all five companies short-listed for thesmallpox procurement, and held face to facediscussions with PowderJect Pharmaceuticals andAcambis, regarding their views of the Department'sprocurement procedures, particularly in the contextof the smallpox vaccine contract. Part 2 9part two2.1 The Department's policy, as set out in the document Procurement Management Policy 2002 , is to be scrupulously fair in all its dealings with suppliers, to use best practice and to continuously seek to achieve bettervalue for money. This part of our report reviews theprocurement procedures used by the Department andby the Agency when contracting on its behalf. Purchasing by the Department and the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency is subjectto detailed rules and guidance, includingTreasury Guidance and EU Directives 2.2 The EEC Treaty requires fair and open competition between member states in the pursuit of trade. EU procurement directives set out the requirements forall large value procurements of works, supplies andservices to be acquired through competition to ensurebest value for money, openness, transparency, equalchances for all irrespective of nationality and non-discriminatory specifications. The directives havebeen brought into UK law via statutory instruments, themost relevant of which is the Public Supply ContractsRegulations 1995, and have been incorporated into theOffice of Government Commerce's, guidance onprocurement practices 1, applicable across all government departments. Breaches of EU directives areactionable in law. 2.3 Both the Department and the Agency issue their own guidance to staff involved in procurement, whichincorporates the key elements of the Treasury guidanceon the application of EU procurement rules. The Agency also provides guidance to NHS staffinvolved in procurement. 2.4 EU regulations require that contracts with values above specified thresholds must be advertised in the OfficialJournal of the European Community (OJEC), unlessexemption clauses apply, for example, for reasons ofnational security, Figure 2 . The exemption clauses are framed in general rather than specific terms in the EU regulations, Treasury guidance, and the PublicSupply Contracts Regulations 1995, leaving what fallswithin national security open to interpretation.

Open procedures are used in 22 per centof procurements, 12 per cent use negotiatedprocedures, and 6 per cent accelerated. Case study A illustrates the key features of the restricted process andCase study B the open process. European procurement rules and their application Procedure Open Restricted Negotiated Accelerated3 Key features and when applicable All respondents to the advert may submit a tender.All tenders submitted before the closing date must be fully evaluated by the purchaser. Open procedures provide the purchaser with the opportunity to test markets where there are a limited number of known suppliers andthe contract specification is straightforward. Enables the purchaser to select preferred bidders from contractors registering an interest, based on an assessment of the capacity ofthe respondent to meet the contract specification. Both the Department of Health and the Agency routinely use restricted procedures. Negotiated procedures with a call for competition (requires an OJEC advert and the purchaser is required to negotiate with at least 3 bidders) may be used when the nature of the purchase does not permit overall pricing or when specifications cannot bedrawn up with sufficient precision to permit the use of open orrestricted procedures. Negotiated procedures without a call for competition (does not require an OJEC advert or negotiation with a specified number of bidders as above) are permitted for technical or artistic reasons orfor the protection of exclusive rights pertaining to the contractor. Negotiated procedures enable the purchaser to ensure that their requirements are fully understood and can be met by the supplierand generally means the supplier is potentially in a strongbargaining position. Procedures must be justified by the buyer and approved by a senior member of staff in accordance with the Department of Health's orthe Agency's scheme of delegation.

The benefits are expected to include better monitoring of implanted prostheses, and earlier identification of those that perform poorly.The development of the Registry follows recommendations made by the National Audit Office (HC 417) and the Committee of Public Accounts (HC 513, Session 1999-2000) in their reports on \"Hip Replacements: Getting it right first time\" in 2000. The contract is divided into four stages: developing an IT based solution to the collection and analysis of activity data surrounding hip and knee joint replacements; establishing the operations, systems and processes concerned with the Registry; the management of the Registry, collection of levies imposed on Trusts but paid to Association of British Health Industries manufacturers and the provision of secretariat support to the NJR Steering Committee; and, the management of the Registry including the transfer of services when the contract expires. This is a new contract let for a period of two and a half years with the option to extend by 15 months. The tender submittedby the successful bidder was for \u00a33.9m.

The procurement processEight contractors out of the 30 expressing interest were invited to tender. They were selected on the basis of their financial standing and demonstrable ability to meet the contract specification. Discussions regarding this initial selectiontook place between interested policy leads and was overseen by members of the Policy Procurement Advisory Unit andthe head of performance management for the specialist health services' Corporate Development Team. Four suppliers submitted a bid. The evaluation involved scoring each one against pre-determined criteria. The tender evaluation panel consisted of policy leads overseen by the Corporate Development Team. The contract was awarded tothe supplier who, while not the cheapest bidder, was considered to have put in the best bid overall to ensure the successof the Registry. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Lords) ratified the award on 12 September 2002. 12part twoPROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH Case study B - Purchase of the influenza vaccine for contingency stock using EU Open Procedures Background Influenza immunisation has been part of the national public health programme since the late 1960s. The vaccine is purchased directly from suppliers by General Practitioners to meet local needs. However, demand is unpredictable andincreases in response to public speculation about the illness. Demand can, therefore, sometimes exceed supply. Also, as the manufacture of the vaccine is complex, manufacturers are not able to respond to unexpected demands atshort notice. Delays in delivery of the vaccine to GPs were experienced in 2000-01. Against this background, in 2001-02 and 2002-03, the Department decided to purchase contingency stocks in case any supplier had serious manufacturing problems that would result in the vaccine being unavailable for the season ratherthan just delayed. We examined the tendering of the 2002-03 contract. The procurement timetable 10 June 2002 - date advertised in the Official Journal of the European Community 17 June 2002 - deadline for the return of expressions of interest from the advert3 July 2002 - invitations to tender issued to contractors6 August 2002 - deadline for the return of tender documents9 September 2002 - award of contract 1 September 2002 - commencement of the contract The EU procurement timetable was met. Procurement processThe contract, valued at \u00a31.2 million, was for one year, with delivery required in September 2002 for the winter campaign. EU open procedures were followed. Six suppliers responded to the OJEC advert and 5 tendered. The evaluation criteria included availability, quantity, and timescales for delivering the vaccines and price. Prices quoted varied depending on the quantity the suppliers could manufacture (the larger the quantity the lower the price-economies of scale). The contract was split between three suppliers and awarded on the basis of how quickly delivery could be made, cost and the desire to avoid supply failures. The three suppliers chosen best met these criteria. 13 part twoPROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH The Department of Health is implementing improvements in itsprocurement procedures to ensurecompliance with its guidance and improveoversight, but progress has been patchy and this may put corporate governance andvalue for money at risk 2.7 Procurement arrangements within the Department are highly devolved and there are many different players (Annex B) . Overall responsibility lies with the Director of Corporate Affairs and day to day responsibility is devolved to business units within theDepartment's 11 Directorates. Procurement activitywithin each business unit is supported by directoratebased Corporate Development Teams (formed in November 2001), many of which are still developingtheir procurement role. 2.8 The Procurement Policy Advisory Unit , within the Department's Information Services Group,disseminates procurement policy and best practiceand also provides direct support to business units onmajor procurement exercises. The Unit has to beinvolved when procurements over \u00a350,000 are set upbut thereafter, and for lower value procurements,usually has no involvement. 2.9 The Business Unit for vaccines is the policy team responsible for immunisation and communicabledisease. The team does not usually procure vaccinesitself, although there are a few exceptions. Vaccineprocurement is normally undertaken by the Agency onbehalf of the Department and financial and logisticalmatters emanating from vaccines procurements arethe responsibility of the NHS Logistics Authority .2.10 The Department's procurement guidance is held electronically on the intranet, but compliance by staffis not routinely monitored by the Procurement PolicyAdvisory Unit. In 2000, the Department's InternalAudit Unit carried out a comprehensive review ofcontracts and found significant weaknesses in theDepartment's procurement strategy, performancemanagement and contract management procedures.Internal Audit could not provide the Department withassurance that proper control was being exercised inthe formation and management of contracts, or thatvalue for money was being achieved. Theirrecommendations are in Figure 4 , and Annex C . 2.11 The Agency has adapted its own guidance for use by NHS Trusts and made this available via its website, butcompliance is not mandatory. !Departmental Policy, Control and Guidance - Procurement Policy Advisory Unit or the Department's solicitors should maintain a central register of allcontracts; the Department should strengthen strategicmanagement and provision of expert advice to managers;and, identify appropriate training programmes for allrelevant staff. !Contract management and documentation - Guidance: should be available on how to preparebusiness cases, appraise options and draft specifications inan easily accessible form; should emphasise EC constraints, allowing managers to highlight theassociated implications in their business cases, such ashow to deal with Ministerial priorities; Standardconditions should be strengthened; and, should includeadministrative instructions, together with proformae, andpost-contract award management systems. !Potential suppliers, Competition and Value for Money - Guidance: should highlight the need to consider thefinancial stability/track record of potential tenderers; state the requirement for a review of tenders against pre-determined tolerance levels to be considered;stipulate that tenderers chosen for contract awards shouldbe required to prove their financial stability; and, stress theimportance of tender document retention as evidence ofan adequate management trail. Source: Internal Audit Review: Department of Health procurement - the formation of associated contracts and decentralised contract management, 2000Key recommendations of the Department's Internal Audit Report, 2000414part twoPROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 2.12 The Department commissioned an independent external review of the Department's procurement arrangements, which reported in May 2001, andlargely endorsed the devolved structure 2. However, the review also repeated many of the weaknessespreviously highlighted by Internal Audit in theimplementation of best practice, policy andprocedures. The main findings were: !General procurement practices and compliancewith guidance issued by the Department werevariable depending on the importance and interestattached to them by local management.Deficiencies had repeatedly been found byInternal Audit (1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000). !The Procurement Policy Advisory Unit was under-resourced and its approach to procurement,and the role and authority afforded to it was atvariance with other major governmentdepartments. For example, the Unit had not beenable to introduce management informationsystems to provide readily available data on whatwas being spent with a particular supplier and thegoods or services received, or develop e-commerce for procurement purposes as requiredacross Whitehall. !Closer liaison was required with the Agency toensure that procurements that started in theDepartment and transferred to the NHS forexecution were fully supported at all stages.2.13 A summary of the external review's recommendations and progress made are at Annex D . Three key recommendations were implemented but progress hasbeen slow: !The role of Procurement Policy Advisory Unitshould be enhanced and expanded to raiseawareness, improve and monitor procurementpractice, and drive forward the e-commerceagenda within the Department. The review recognised that the Unit did not have sufficientresources to meet its existing commitments andthat interim measures would be required before itsrole could be developed further. The Departmenthas attempted to boost staff numbers, with limitedsuccess. It restructured the Unit into two teams,one to provide support to business units on majorprocurements and the other to develop andoversee the implementation of the procurementmanagement policy and implement theGovernment's e-commerce agenda. Staff shortageshave meant that the focus has been on supportingbusiness units rather than on addressing longerterm issues. !The Department should accredit business units'procurement activities whereby they are permitted to operate within defined parametersdepending on their level of expertise. A pilotexercise was completed in June 2002. !The Department should produce and implement aprocurement management policy. A policy was produced and approved by the Department'sManagement Board. It was issued to Directors andCorporate Development Teams in February 2002and placed on the Department's intranet. Butimplementation has been slow. For example, thepolicy requires the Unit to prepare an annualreport on the Department's procurementperformance but it has so far been unable to do so,in part due to the staff shortages and weaknessesin management information systems. 2 The review, Department of Health: Procurement Review, May 2001 was conducted by a consultant recommended by the Office of Governm ent Commerce. The Deputy Chief Executive of the Office of Government Commerce was on the Steering Group for this review.15 part twoPROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 2.14 The external review also pointed out that one of the key benefits of an enhanced Procurement Policy Advisory Unit would be better value for money. In their view, a more effective and better co-ordinatedprocurement operation across the Department shouldbe able to achieve value for money improvements ofbetween 2.5 and 3 per cent of the spend over whichthey have influence. This could be in the form of an improvement in quality or cash savings of up to \u00a35-6 million a year based on the estimatedcommercial spend at the time of the review, which was \u00a3200 million. 2.15 In October 2002, the Department commissioned the Deputy Chief Executive of the OGC to lead a reviewof its commercial and procurement activities in itssupport to the NHS. Recommendations for the futureprocurement structure, resourcing of a CommercialDivision, including its relationship with the NHS, and a job and person specification of a CommercialDirector were made to the Director of Finance and Investment and the Permanent Secretary in March 2003 for them to consider. 2.16 The Department also plans to improve management information on contracts as part of theimplementation of a new financial and businessmanagement system due to be established on 1 April 2004. 2.17 Given our focus on vaccine procurement, we did not examine in depth the procurement systems andarrangements in the Agency for other areas ofprocurement activity. However, the Agency hasidentified weaknesses in its contract managementarrangements, including a lack of : !Information routinely available on its contractportfolio; and contract usage by NHSorganisations, as data supplied by private sectorcontractors is variable; !One supplier database. Buyers maintain their ownsupplier databases and the Agency is not easilyable to analyse supplier information which insome cases could improve its negotiating positionwith major suppliers; !An adequate monitoring system to identifypotential instances of non-compliance withprocurement rules while procurements are inprogress. However, files are reviewed on an ad hoc basis to check compliance with EUprocurement rules and Agency guidance. 2.18 The Agency is in the process of improving its procedures through the introduction of a singlecontract management system that will address theweaknesses outlined above. It plans to implement this by April 2003.16part threePROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH Smallpox virusPart 3PROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH Procurement of vaccines 17 part three3.1 This part of our report examines the Department's procurement of vaccines as part of its national immunisation programme and for emergencies and contingency. As well as buying vaccines within a national vaccination programme, the Departmentpurchases supplies as a contingency measureand to address actual or potential emergencies 3.2 The Department is responsible for determining the need for vaccines and strategies for its childhood and other immunisation programmes. The Department'sCommunicable Disease Branch develops vaccine policyand programmes of immunisation (Figure 5) , which are set out in the publication Immunisation against Infectious Disease, 1996 3(the Green Book), currently being updated. This covers all types of vaccines,including those not included in the nationalimmunisation programme. Revisions to policy and theprogramme of vaccination are announced in ChiefMedical Officer letters. 3.3 As well as buying for the national vaccination programme, the Department buys vaccines forcontingency and emergency use: !Influenza4- Contingency supplies have been held for the last two years (2001-02 and 2002-03) in case manufacturers failed to supply on time, thereby causing delays to the national influenza programme, or to supply sufficient quantities tomeet unexpected need. !Smallpox5- New supplies were procured in 2002 as a countermeasure to a deliberate release of thedisease (bio-terrorism) following the events of 11 September 2001 in the United States. And afurther procurement exercise was announced inOctober 2002. !Anthrax6- Additional supplies were procured in 2002 as a countermeasure to bio-terrorism. 3.4 The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has a responsibility to advise the Secretaries of State forHealth, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland onmatters relating to communicable diseases, preventableand potentially preventable through immunisation. Its remit covers routine as well specific matters and, informulating advice and recommendations, it considersthe need for and impact of vaccines, their quality andstrategies to ensure maximum benefit from their mostappropriate use. Procurement is undertaken within an agreed strategy, based on business cases developedwhen circumstances change or there is newmedical evidence 3.5 Public health policies drive the need to purchase types and strains. Where policies or objectives remain unchanged and there are no changes in supply oravailability of routine vaccines, business cases for theprocurement of vaccines, including risk and cost-benefitanalysis, are not routinely undertaken prior to each re-tendering exercise. National policy regardingcontinued use of most routine vaccines has beenreviewed in the last three years usually by the JointCommittee on Vaccination and Immunisation. 3 The Chapter on Meningococcal vaccines was updated in 1999, when a new policy was introduced and other policy changes have been announced in Chief Medical Officer letters. 4 See Glossary, page 33. 5 See Glossary, page 33.6 See Glossary, page 33.18part threePROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH The Department of Health's immunisation programme5 Source: Department four months old Measles, and Rubella (MMR)Around 13 months old Hepatitis B PneumococcalInfluenzaThose at riskThose at riskFor 65 year olds and over - and at risk groups of all ages (respitory,asthma, heart disease, renal disease,diabetes, and immunosuppression) Smallpox AnthraxEmergency stocks for use in event of terrorist attacks For those at risk due to their occupation and emergencystocks for use in event ofterrorist attacksPolio Tuberculin(for skin testing)10 to 14 year olds(and sometimes shortly after birth) Tetanus and low dosediphtheria (Td), Polio13 to 18 year olds Contingency and atrisk immunisation Emergency vaccines NOTE See Glossary, Page 33, for desciption of diseasesNational Childhood Programme19 part threePROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 3.6 Detailed cost-benefit analysis is undertaken prior to introducing a new vaccination programme, for example the Meningitis C vaccine programme in 1999, or whenthere are major changes to the programme, for example,the introduction of Diphtheria, Tetanus and acellularPertussis vaccines in the pre-school boosterimmunisation programme in 2001. These are preparedto help justify additional funds. 3.7 Generally, costs are secondary to public health and national priority issues. This is particularly the case withregard to vaccines purchased for emergencies wherenational priorities are paramount. In these cases,submissions were made to Ministers setting out the risksto public health of not purchasing, the quantitiesneeded, costs, and funding arrangements. 3.8 We looked at the adequacy of the Department's policy making process, using the example of the new MeningitisC vaccination programme, in our report Modern Policy-Making: Ensuring Policies Deliver Value for Money, 2001,(HC 289 Session 2001- 02). We concluded that the policywas developed and delivered satisfactorily. 3.9 Case study C provides another example of decision- making. It shows that a sub-group, convened under theauspices of the Joint Committee on Vaccination andImmunisation, played an important part in the decisionto purchase smallpox vaccine and in the choice of theLister strain. Case study C - The decision-making process for the need and strain of the smallpox vaccine Although smallpox was eradicated from the world in the 1970s, the UK, like other countries, holds a contingency stockpileof the vaccine (over 4 million doses of calf skin derived Elstree Lister). Following the events of 11 September 2001, theDepartment reviewed their ability to deal with terrorist attacks, including biological terrorism and convened a sub-group ofexperts, under the auspices of the JCVI, to discuss smallpox issues. At its first meeting on 27 September, the sub-groupconcluded that: !Existing stockpiles were inadequate to provide the full population with protection in the event that this might be needed; !Application with bifurcated needles would increase available stocks four-fold but this was still insufficient for the whole population; !The existing stock, although still potent, was past its expiry date (30 years old) and no longer licensed but was suitable for use in an emergency situation; !There was an immediate need to identify other potential sources of smallpox vaccine; and, !In the longer term a completely new vaccine should be developed that would also be capable of being licensed. At its second meeting on 30 September, the sub-group considered the appropriate strain to purchase. It concluded: !There was no real difference in efficacy between the Lister strain and the New York City Board of Health (NYCBH) strain chosen by the US; !A final decision would involve availability, licence and cost; and, !Using a different strain from that used in the US, and one in use by the Israeli military, offered the greatest safeguard ifdifficulties arose with the production of either strain ensuring that the alternative strain could act as a fallback. Subsequently, the sub-group recommended the Lister strain. On 18 December 2001, the Department and MoD officials met and agreed that the Lister strain should be pursued based on the UK's experience in the past, its provenance as an effective vaccine strain, and the MoD's strong preference. On the sameday, following discussions with the Minister, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer gave officials the go ahead to begin talks withpotential suppliers on their ability to meet the Department's needs. The Department outlined to Ministers on 18 February 2002 its recommendations to purchase the Lister strain, its short and long term procurement strategies, and its assessment of potential suppliers. The Minister subsequently challenged the choiceof the Lister strain over the NYCBH strain. However, following further submissions, the Minister approved the Department'sstrategy on 5 March 2002.3.10 Once the Department has established a need for a particular vaccination programme, it arranges for the purchase of vaccines through a series of agencies. The Purchasing and Supply Agency plays a key role inthe tendering process for childhood, contingency and atrisk vaccines. The respective roles of the variousagencies are outlined in Figure 6.Vaccine procurement is subject to the Department of Health's generalprocurement procedures 3.11 We examined 18 recently let vaccine contracts against assessment criteria agreed with the Department. With the exception of smallpox and anthrax vaccines,contracts were arranged by the Agency and theprocurements were subject to general procurementrules described in Part 2. In the following paragraphs wesummarise our findings under key criteria. Annex E shows our findings on each procurement.The Authority with responsibility for financial and logistical matters emanating from vaccine procurement: !financial administration of goods and services !financial reporting to the Department on stocks and cash for resource accounting and audit !financial forecasting for budgetary planning and management 20part threePROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH Key players and their responsibilities within the vaccine procurement process6 The Department of Health PH6, the business unit within the Department with responsibility for immunisation and communicable diseases: !policy responsibility for immunisation !co-ordination of NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency and NHS Logistics in relation to vaccine contract activity !budget holder for vaccine purchase and supply !purchase and supply of other contingency pharmaceuticals for public health useThe Department of Health !Non-departmental public body (NDPB) !Considers the need for and impactof vaccines, their quality andimmunisation strategies !Makes recommendations to UKHealth MinistersJoint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation Purchase own supplies of adult vaccinesNHS Trusts Purchase own supplies of adult andtravel vaccines direct from suppliersGeneral PractitionersThe Department of Health The Agency with responsibility for vaccine procurement on behalf of the Department: !tenders contracts !stock control and monitoring of delivery schedules !management and monitoring of contracted vaccine suppliers !communication on supply with end users in the NHSNHS Purchasing and Supply Agency Source: Department of Health; National Audit Office researchCold storage and distribution of vaccinesNHS Logistics Contractors for storage & distribution (Farillon for childhood vaccines)21 part threePROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH Childhood, contingency and at risk vaccine procurements complied with EU procurement rules 3.12 All childhood, contingency and at risk vaccine procurements were subject to EU procurement rules. We found that the contracting procedures for theseprocurements complied with the rules and wereadvertised in the Official Journal of the EuropeanCommunity (OJEC). Open or restricted procedures werefollowed in the majority of cases, Figure 7 . Emergency vaccine procurement procedures were different 3.13 Full EU procedures, including advertisement in OJEC, were not appropriate for the anthrax vaccine because the Department itself holds the Marketing Authorisation(product licence) for this vaccine. The licence relates toone specific manufacturer, the Centre for AppliedMicrobiology and Research (the executive arm of theMicrobiological Research Authority, a Special HealthAuthority). The vaccine was purchased under a ServiceLevel Agreement (Case study D) . The US is the only other producer of this vaccine worldwide, although thetype of strain is slightly different, and producedspecifically for use by the US military. 3.14 For the purchase of the first tranche of smallpox vaccine in 2002, the Department used the exemptionsallowable under the EU rules for reasons of nationalsecurity (Case study E) . Case study D - Anthrax vaccine was purchased from the only manufacturer of this vaccine in the UK Anthrax vaccine is supplied by the NHS only to those at occupational risk of the disease. The vaccine is producedby the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research(CAMR). In January 2002, the Department asked CAMR tosupply anthrax vaccine for emergency stockpiles as acountermeasure to possible bio-terrorist attacks, at a costof \u00a35 million. The Department intends to purchase furtherquantities over the next two years with the aim ofsubstantially increasing stocks. The contract was placed by single tender, under a Service Level Agreement. The Department did not negotiate on price. Following September 11, CAMR hasreceived enquiries about supplying other countriesincluding the US Department of Defence who want toenhance their stocks. Types of tender procedures followed for vaccine contracts 7 Source: NAO examinationNon-advertised Negotiated Open Restricted Number of contracts0123456789 1 0 Case study E - In purchasing the first tranche of smallpox vaccine in April 2002,the Department used the exemptionunder EU rules on the grounds that it wasnecessary to protect the basic interests of the security of the UK The decision to purchase up to date stocks of smallpox vaccine was taken on 18 December 2001 as a means ofstrengthening the UK capability against possiblebiological terrorist attacks. The Department decided touse confidential procurement procedures, as allowed forunder EU rules for reasons of national security. The Department's solicitors advised that the exemptionunder the Public Supply Contracts Regulations 1995(Regulation 6(c)) was appropriate. The relevant EU exemption regulation was Article 223.1(b) of the EEC treaty (measures necessary for the protectionof the essential interests of a Member State's securitywhich are connected with the production of, amongstother things, countermeasures to biological agents). Thebasis were the urgency of supply, the fact that smallpoxhas been eradicated, and the purchase was needed as amedical countermeasure for use in response to a bio-terrorist attack. The procurement was not advertised. Confidential discussions were held with five potential suppliers,selected from a list of twelve, with known productioncapabilities in the UK and Europe. 22part threePROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH Case study F - Decisions on the strain, timescale, security of supplies limited the number of companies competing for the contract for smallpox vaccine in January 2002 to one company The Department's overriding procurement requirements when they began the procurement process were to: !buy the new cell-derived Lister strain vaccine forsmallpox (in line with safety advice from theEuropean Agency for the Evaluation of MedicinalProducts (EMEA) that the new vaccine should becell-culture derived); !ensure the security of its supply; and, !ensure the speed of its delivery in the short term. However, although a consensus had been reached inDecember 2001 to pursue the new cell derived Listerstrain, at the meetings with the potential companies inJanuary and February 2002, the Department stated a\"preference\" for the Lister strain rather than a definitiverequirement. This was partly because the Departmentwanted to keep its options open in the event there was nosupplier of a cell derived form of the Lister strain. With regard to security of supply, Ministers had initally expressed a preference that the vaccine should bemanufactured in the UK because this would give the bestguarantee of delivery and production of vaccine in theevent of bio-terrorist attacks in the UK and elsewhere.However, following advice from Departmental officials,Ministers accepted that this would not be within the rulesof fair competition and that, in any event, there was noUK manufacturing of smallpox vaccine. Nevertheless,Ministers advised that UK based companies should beapproached initially. The Department selected 12 potential suppliers based on their knowledge of the vaccine industry. On 7 January 2002, a group of officials from the Department and the MoD, chaired by a Principal MedicalOfficer, short-listed 5 potential suppliers, based on areview of each of the twelve companies to manufacturesmallpox vaccine within the Minister's parameters. Aventis Pasteur MSD and RIVM. In addition, the Department joined the MoD in a visit to Bavarian Nordic's plant in Germany on 30 January 2002,but Bavarian Nordic declined to deal directly with the Department as it had an exclusive partnership with PowderJect.At the Department's invitation, four of the companiesattended confidential meetings, whilst a confidentialteleconference was held with another. The companies were not given any information prior to the meeting. After signing confidentiality agreements, each was askedspecific set questions on their ability to supply suchquantities of vaccine and time-scale. The manufacturerswere reassured that any information they provided wouldbe dealt with confidentially. The key areas discussed during the confidential meetings were: !Vaccine strain and type of manufacture (e.g. cell culture) !Production capability !Potential for licensed vaccine !Time-scales (for the short-term, first tranche purchase the vaccine had to be available by the end of 2002) and quantity !Costs The companies were subsequently asked to providewritten information against these key areas for the shortand long terms, as well as the availability of immediate\"off the shelf\" supplies. Three companies provided thisinformation within the deadline, and one submitted apresentation which the Department accepted. TheDepartment was able to obtain all the information itneeded to assess all the companies. The Department evaluated the companies' information on 13 February and made its recommendations to theMinister on 18 February. This evaluation showed that: !Aventis Pasteur MSD and RIVM had they were calf-skin based and wouldtherefore, not satisfy the new EU regulations,particularly in relation to TSE (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy). !PowderJect, Acambis and RIVM had new cell derived Lister strain. AventisPasteur MSD had the capability to produce the oldtype Lister vaccine but was not interested in producingthe new cell derived Lister strain vaccine at that time.GSK were not planning to produce the Lister strainvaccine in the short-term. !PowderJect was the only company with the potentialto manufacture in the UK. It would transfer technology to manufacture smallpox vaccine from BavarianNordic to its factory in Speke in the longer term. Butfor the first tranche, short-term purchase, manufacturewould take place in Germany. RIVM did not have aUK base which would make security of suppliesdifficult to achieve. Acambis had a UK base butmanufacture would be in the US. 23 part threePROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH PowderJect Pharmaceuticals Plc's manufacturing facility in Liverpool Photograph: Courtesy of PowderJect.!PowderJect could supply new cell-derived Lister strain vaccine the fastest. It could supply a quantity by June 2002 and the remainder by September. Acambis could have supplied the Lister strain but in a comparatively longer time frame. However,Acambis could have supplied the NYCBH strainquicker than it could the Lister strain, but not until the third quarter of 2002. !The Department accepted that for the purposes of theemergency stockpiles, the first tranche, short-termpurchase of smallpox vaccine would be unlicensed. !In terms of cost, although PowderJect's quote was oneof the lowest, prices were not directly comparable asquotes were based on different vaccine types andstrains and cost elements. The Department told us that PowderJect provided the bestmatch to their overall requirements. The contract between PowderJect and the Department was signed on 11 April 2002. 24part threePROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 3.15 In the follow-up procurement announced in October 2002, on advice from the Department's Permanent Secretary and Director of Finance andInvestment and the Agency, the Minister of Healthagreed that grounds of urgency no longer applied and itwould be inappropriate to set aside the normal EU procurement rules because the Department: !having augmented its emergency stocks, timescalesfor the next phase were less urgent; !wanted to be as transparent as possible about itspurchase of smallpox vaccine; and, !wanted to follow as closely as possible the normalroute of procurement. The OJEC route would allowthis to be achieved without compromising nationalsecurity and would ensure that any potential newsuppliers are identified. 3.16 The procurement was advertised in the Official Journal of the European Community on 23 October 2002 andexpressions of interest were received by 29 November.All but one of the original companies responded(PowderJect, Acambis, Aventis Pasteur MSD andRIVM). One other company also responded. Tenderdocumentation was sent out on 20 February 2003,following a pre-tender meeting with the companies on10 January. Included in the specification is therequirement for a licensed form of Lister strain cell-derived vaccine. Three bids were received on 1 April 2003, the deadline for submissions. Key decisions on conditions attached to the first smallpox procurement exerciseinhibited competition 3.17 For the smallpox vaccine contract, decisions on strain and security of supply (a preference for a UK manufacturing company was initially stated byMinisters), together with the small number of companiesoperating in this market, limited the number ofcompanies able to compete for this contract. TheDepartment held confidential meetings in January andFebruary 2002 with five potential suppliers with a UK orEuropean based manufacturing capability (PowderJect,GlaxoSmithKline, Acambis, Aventis Pasteur the supply therequired doses against the Department's criteria in thetime-scale specified, but only through its partnershipwith Bavarian Nordic (Case study F) . 3.18 Although price was not the key criteria in the Department's decision to appoint PowderJect,PowderJect did offer one of the lowest quotes. However,each supplier's quote was different in terms of vaccinestrain and type and the elements of costs included.Prices were therefore not directly comparable. 3.19 Whilst the Department tested the market to ensure a level playing field for all competitors, the companiestold us that they felt that the procurement process,including criteria, was not transparent. The particularpoints they made were: !The Department did not clearly state that it wasinterested in the Lister strain only (as it used theterms \"preferred\" or \"favoured\" throughout theprocurement process) and this was misleading; !The Department did not reveal the procurementcriteria or timelines. There was no indication that thesupplies were required in 2002. The timescalesspecified in the \"points to consider\" document were18 to 24 months, which were interpreted variouslyby companies. Definitions of short, medium andlong-term were, therefore, unclear; !Companies were expecting a second stage to theprocurement process whereby they would receivefull tendering specifications against which to put informal bids; and, !Companies were expected to consider licensingissues and clinical trials but were not informed of theDepartment's decision to accept an unlicensedproduct. This would have had a significant impacton the prices quoted by some companies. 3.20 Consequently, companies felt that they had prepared their written proposals (following confidential meetingswith the Department of Health) with limited informationon procurement criteria, timescales, scope of thecontract and the strain of vaccine. 3.21 The Department's view is that they were consistent in the information that they provided to each company andgave as complete information as they felt able to giveunder the circumstances. The Department recognisesthat there may have been a mismatch between theinformation provided and the interpretation of this bythe companies and this arises because of the unusualnature of this procurement as highlighted inCase study E . 25 part threePROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH Contracts were awarded to those at least meeting the tender specifications 3.22 All vaccines routinely administered in the UK are required to have a Marketing Authorisation (product licence) valid in the UK. All the vaccines we examineddid, with the exception of smallpox. The currentsuppliers of other older vaccines received theirMarketing Authorisations when the licensingrequirements were less stringent. In some cases thesewere granted as licences of right to products on themarket before the Medicines Act 1968 was fully enactedin the late 1970s, for example, BCG, Diphtheria Tetanus(combined and separate) and Oral Polio vaccines. Newproducers of older vaccines also require a licence, andthis can be a barrier to widening competition, especiallywhere, for example, the full clinical trial data requiredfor an application is not available. 3.23 There is no UK licence for the smallpox vaccine. All vaccines carry risks to the receipient when thevaccine is administered of possible side-effects. Thiscould, in turn, lead to the manufacturer being sued fordamages. In the case of smallpox vaccine, which wasunlicensed, the Department bore the risks byindemnifying PowderJect against the potential for suchdamages (see Case study G) . Propriety 3.24 For the vaccine contracts that we examined, the Department acted properly in awarding these contractsby complying with appropriate EU procurementregulations, encouraging sufficient competition andevaluating tenders fairly. 3.25 However, the purchase of smallpox vaccine from PowderJect raised concerns amongst some suppliers, in Parliament and the media about propriety. Dr Paul Drayson, Chief Executive and Chairman ofPowderJect, made donations to the Labour Party on 25 July 2001 and 11 January 2002 of \u00a350,000 each. Thesecond donation and media coverage relating to the firstdonation coincided with the timing of the smallpoxprocurement exercise, raising suspicions about a possiblelink between the donations and award of the contract. It was between 7 January to 18 February that officialsshort-listed companies, set procurement criteria, heldconfidential meetings with companies, assessed thecompanies and prepared the Ministerial Submissionrecommending PowderJect. A chronology of eventsleading to the award of the smallpox contract is at Figure 8 and Annex F . 3.26 The officials involved in making the recommendations to appoint PowderJect, including the Deputy ChiefMedical Officer, confirmed to us that they first knew ofthe donations on 18 February 2002 when the Minister'sprivate office informed them having seen theirsubmission to the Minister. It was then that the Minister'sprivate secretary made the connection between thecompany recommended and recent media reports (17 February) about the donations and acted byinforming officials and the Minister. This was after theprocurement assessment had been completed and thesupplier selected by officials. Case study G - No smallpox vaccine is currently licensed for use in the UK PowderJect began supplying quantities of smallpox vaccinefrom June 2002 with the final deliveries completed inMarch 2003. The vaccine was tested by the NationalInstitute for Biological Standards and Control for potencyand stability before delivery. As this smallpox vaccine is an unlicensed product, the Department indemnified the vaccine supplier againstdamages arising from any side-effects caused by using anunlicensed vaccine. An indemnity of \u00a330 million was estimated as the contingent liability arising out of the use of the newlypurchased unlicensed vaccine. Although complication ratesfor the Lister strain were available, the Department based itscontingent liability assessment on rates reported by theCentre for Disease Control in the US, specific to theNYCBH strain. The Department told us that complicationrates for the Lister strain tend to be higher. Therefore, thereis a risk that the contingent liability calculated was lowerthan it should have been because it was based on a differentvaccine strain, with lower complication rates. The Department notified the Committee of Public Accounts of the contingent liability on 26 March 2002.Chronology of events leading to the award of the smallpox vaccine contract 26part threePROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 8 Source: NAO examination (Annex F); Department of Health; PowderJect Pharmaceuticals PLCDate Event 11 September 2001 Terrorist attacks in US 18 December 2001 Department and MoD decide to purchase smallpox vaccine (jointly) and to pursue the Lister strain.

The Permanent Secretary endorsed therecommendation on the grounds that in the short-termthe only source of the cell-derived Lister strain smallpoxvaccine in the UK was from PowderJect. The key factorsin award of the contract, therefore, were the cell-derived Lister strain, speed of delivery and nationalsecurity issues. Ensuring competition in the vaccine market is difficult in view of the limited number ofsuppliers resulting in few expressions ofinterest for each contract advertised andthere is a risk of relatively higher prices 3.28 There are limited suppliers and manufacturers in the vaccine market and the near monopolistic conditions for some vaccines mean that only one or two suppliersgenerally express an interest when contracts areadvertised. The main reasons for the narrow marketrelate to the high and increasing cost of vaccinedevelopment and production, mergers of manufacturersand the relatively low profit margins compared withother pharmaceutical products, Figure 9 . 3.29 Limited competition makes it more difficult to get competitive prices and secure value for money. TheDepartment's procurement strategy is to award acontract to more than one supplier where possible.Figure 10 shows the Department's current suppliers of vaccines. In four cases, the Department awardedcontracts to more than one supplier in order to ensurecontinuity of supply and competition (Case studies B, H and I) . For example, in purchasing contingency supplies of the influenza vaccine the Department awardedcontracts to three tenderers, mainly to cover foreventualities such as supply shortages, as experiencedin 2000 (see Case study B) . !Vaccine manufacture is a complex and time-consuming process that requires significant investment in plant and research, and carries greater risk than traditional sterileor non-sterile pharmaceutical manufacturing. Unlikepharmaceuticals, which are usually synthesized fromchemicals, most vaccines are produced from or use livingbiological organisms. Cultivation for many viral vaccinesbegins with almost laboratory scale culture and isprogressively scaled up to larger and larger culture vessels.Each step takes a finite time and cannot be accelerated, asthe cultures have to grow naturally. It can take 2 to 3 yearsto achieve licensure and thereafter, a typical productionschedule, including growing the antigen, purifying, testing,packaging, and performing final quality checks can takebetween 1 to 2 years depending on the type of vaccinationbeing produced, viral or bacterial, live or inactivated. !Many manufacturing plants are dedicated facilities, builtand maintained to produce specific vaccines and cannoteasily be expanded or switched to produce other vaccines. !Rationalisation by manufacturers worldwide to reducecosts and to concentrate production, marketing andresearch to specific vaccine types. !Mergers and acquisitions have reduced the number ofvaccine manufacturers. !Many larger pharmaceutical companies have been exiting the vaccine market as it not as profitable as drugs.Vaccines have to compete with pharmaceutical productswithin a manufacturer's portfolio. Factors such as relativelylong research and development period, the need tomaintain production facilities to meet regulatory standardsand the relatively fixed market size may hinder thecompetitive position of some vaccines relative to otherpharmaceutical products. !Regulators such as the Food and Drug Administration inthe US, the European Medicines Evaluation Agency(EMEA), and the Medicines Control Agency in the UK haveincreased the quality standards for vaccines in recentyears. Complying with standards is much harder and morecostly when dealing with biological as opposed tochemical processes.

Source: BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH The limited number of vaccine manufactures and the complex vaccine manufacturingprocess has resulted in supply shortages ofcertain vaccines, thereby jeopardising theimmunisation programme 3.30 In most cases suppliers have met delivery requirements, including quality. However, for vaccines, such as Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR), and BacillusCalmette-Guerin (BCG), where there are a small numberof vaccine manufacturers or sole suppliers with licencesfor the UK, supply shortages have occurred. Productionproblems including batch failures are common reasons.Recovery from a major batch failure may take a numberof months and with the increasing centralisation ofmanufacturing can rapidly lead to an internationalvaccine shortage. 3.31 The Department's strategy has been to award the contract to more than one supplier where possible. Forexample, in December 2002 the Department placed acontract for the supply of the MMR vaccine with theonly two suppliers with product licenses valid in the UK- Aventis Pasteur MSD and GlaxoSmithKline - to ensurecontinuity of supply. As Case study H shows, this prudent approach enabled supplies to be met. 3.32 As Case study I illustrates, the Department adopts a flexible approach when there is a risk that itsimmunisation programme may become too dependenton one particular supplier. In the case of BCG, theDepartment encouraged a second supplier to seek a UKlicence to ensure the continuity of its supply as italready had problems with its existing supplier. 3.33 In the case of Haemophilus influenzae, Diphtheria, Tetanus, and wholecell Pertussis (Hib/DTwP) 7vaccine (Case study J on page 31) , the Department experienced supply problems despite awarding the contract to morethan one supplier. The Department were able to switchbetween products to maintain supplies. 3.34 The Department is also reviewing the length of contracts and whether there is sufficient time between contractaward and start dates. Generally it has placed contractsfor one or two years for childhood vaccines, with theoption of an extension in most cases. Using shortercontracts allows the Department to make changes to itsprogramme quickly and minimise the risk of unwantedvaccine stocks, as well as enabling the market to betested regularly. But using shorter contracts, and theinsufficient time between notifying the award and theactual start of the contract, can create uncertainty withsuppliers and hesitancy in expressing an interest. As manufacturing lead times are sufficiently protracted,suppliers may not have vaccines ready when required ifawards are made with inadequate notice. TheDepartment told us that it reviews each contract on itsown merits when deciding on contract length. Whilst the Department has taken steps to ensure continuity of supply, there may bescope to do more 3.35 The potential for recurring shortages will remain because of the complex nature and lengthy vaccine production process. Severe vaccine shortages wereexperienced in the US at the beginning of 2001. TheNational Vaccine Advisory Committee has consideredways of strengthening the supply of routinely usedvaccines in the US. This highlighted the need forproactive short and long-term strategies, as summarisedin Figure 11 on page 31 . Some of these may be of relevance to the UK also.Case study H - Measles, Mumps and Rubella Mumps and Rubella (also known as GermanMeasles) are diseases caused by viruses, spread when theviruses are passed from an infectious person to someonewho is not immune. The MMR contract After an OJEC competition, the Department placedcontracts for the supply of the MMR vaccine inDecember 2000, to run from April 2001 to March 2002(i.e. one year) with an option for a further year. There areonly two suppliers with product licenses valid in the UK- Aventis Pasteur MSD and GlaxoSmithKline - and theDepartment awarded contracts to both, to ensurecontinuity of supply. Supply difficulties 600,000 doses were ordered from each company. Due toproduction problems, Aventis were unable to supply allthe doses contracted for. As they also supply othercountries, they are rationing supplies. Due to havingcontracts with 2 suppliers, the Department was able toincrease supplies from GlaxoSmithKline, who currentlymeet 75% of the page 33.Source: NHS PASA 30part threePROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH Background Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease of the respiratory system, which is caused by a bacterium that spreads through the air. Theincidence of TB in the UK is continuing to increase, between 1987 and 2001 there was a 21% increase in cases of TB andin 2001 approximately 7,000 new cases were diagnosed. Within the UK, the Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination is part of the Department of Health's childhood immunisation programme. The programme covers school children between the ages of 10 to 14; in addition there is selectivevaccination of higher risk groups, for example babies born into ethnic groups at higher risk of TB and new entrants from, andvisitors to, high prevalence areas of the world. Procurement arrangements for BCG The Purchasing and Supply Agency procures BCG vaccine on behalf of the Department of Health. The last tendering exercisetook place in June 2000 for contracts to run from 1 October 2000 to 30 September 2002, with the option to extend to 30 September 2004. Whilst the tendering process commenced for a new contract to be in place for a 1 October 2000 startdate, the contract was eventually awarded in March 2001. This was due to a much higher price quoted by Celltech Medeva,the then owners of the Evans Vaccines manufacturing facility in Speke where the BCG was being produced. Departmentalofficials were concerned about the escalating price and were exploring other options and seeking Ministerial approval on theway forward. During the procurement process, PowderJect acquired Evans Vaccines in October 2000. Both Evans/PowderJect and Statens Serum Institute (SSI) were awarded contracts for the supply of BCG in March 2001, because the Department recognised the risks to the vaccination programme of dependence on a single supplier,and the need to catch-up with and maintain the schools immunisation programme in the future. The Evans/PowderJectcontract award was subject to availability of supplies and the SSI award was subject to the company obtaining a UK licence.SSI were granted a UK license on 9 September 2002. Supply difficulties There has been a history of problems with the supply of BCG from Evans Vaccines. In September 1999, the Departmentsuspended the routine schools-based part of the immunisation programme as there was insufficient vaccine supply to providefor this and those at higher risk. This was because of a manufacturing problem at the Evans Vaccine manufacturing site atSpeke. The immunisation programme fully recommenced in September 2001, once Evans/PowderJect's BCG vaccineproduction was sufficient to allow the whole programme to re-instate. In August 2002, however, Evans/PowderJect withdrew all batches of their BCG vaccine voluntarily after tests on a single batch of BCG supplied to Ireland showed that the product's end of shelf life potency test was below specification. The Departmenthas now ceased to purchase their BCG vaccine from Evans/PowderJect and has received an undertaking that it will receivea refund for the unused BCG vaccine it currently holds. Consequently, SSI is now the sole supplier of BCG vaccine in the UK and the risks associated with dependence on one supplier remain. PowderJect indicated to us that whilst it aims to re-introduce its BCG vaccine in the UK, the current tenderstructure of short-term contracts and the high level of investment required to produce biological products may not make thisa viable proposition.Case study I - Tuberculosis (TB) and the Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin Vaccination (BCG)8 8 See Glossary, page 3331 part threePROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 1Increase funds for vaccine stockpiles to include all routinely administered vaccines in sufficient quantity to be used foramelioration of supply problems or surge demands. 2Require vaccine manufacturers to provide advancenotification to the Department of Health and HumanServices regarding intent to withdraw from the market. 3Increase the availability of accurate information aboutvaccine supply for opinion leaders and consumers.Appropriate information about vaccine supply can becommunicated by a website containing currentinformation about the availability of vaccines. 4Enhance the valuation of vaccines by initiating a nationalcampaign to emphasize the safety and efficacy and greatbenefit of recommended vaccines for the public good. Solutions that are more complex and will require more studyinclude the following: 1Convene a multi-disciplinary group to evaluate the nature of appropriate incentives for manufacturers to sustain thesupply of existing vaccines and stimulate development ofnew vaccines. 2Streamline and strengthen the regulatory processes and theactivities of the FDA, including a) support the work ofinternational harmonization for mutual recognition of lotreleases of various vaccines; and b) review theimplementation of current Good Manufacturing Practicesto assure that science-based decisions regarding vaccinesafety and efficacy are made. Source: Strengthening the supply of routinely recommended vaccinesin the United States: A report of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee, October 2002Ways of dealing with shortages of routine vaccinesupplies suggested by the National Vaccine Advisory Committee of the US11Case study J - Supplies shortagesexperienced despite contracting withmore than one manufacturer of theHaemophilus influenzae type b,Diphtheria, Tetanus, and wholecell Pertussis (Hib/DTwP) vaccine During the latter part of 1998 and throughout 1999, the UK experienced severe shortages of key vaccines fromdifferent manufacturers. These difficulties sometimes ledto interruptions in the childhood immunisationprogramme that were unwelcome to health professionalsand to parents. If no vaccines were available, suchinterruptions could endanger public health leavingchildren without protection against potentially lethaldiseases. The disruptions were most significant for thosevaccines where there was only one source of supply. One of the most important vaccines, Hib/DTP (given to babies at 2, 3, and 4 months of age) was of particularconcern. Although contracts were let with twomanufacturers, both experienced manufacturing problemsfor different reasons, at the same time. This lead toprotracted disruptions in availability. However, theDepartment were able to switch between products andcompanies and were able to continually keep sufficientvaccine available for issue to meet demand. For example,when shortages of the combined product first occurred theDepartment were able to switch to an alternative supply ofseparate Hib and DTwP vaccines already let against adifferent contract to keep the primary schedule running. However, supply of the combined product continued to be severely disrupted throughout 1999. This was fordifferent reasons. Both of the manufacturers experiencedrepeated batch failures (for unrelated reasons) and one ofthem also had a problem with a filling plant (resulting inthe production cessation of a novel type of dual chambersyringe). With forward forecasting, the Department wasable to identify that the UK would have no stock left bythe end of December 1999. On 2 December 1999, a Chief Medical Officer letter (PL/CMO/99/5, PL/CNO/99/9, PL/CPHO/99/4) was sent tothe profession detailing these problems and what steps hadbeen taken to maintain supply. The key change was to alertthe profession that once the current supply of combinedHib/DTwP was exhausted, the UK would be using adifferent vaccine containing acellular pertussis (Hib/DTaP)instead of the hitherto used wholecell type. The first issuesof the combined Hib/DTaP commenced at the end ofDecember 1999. From then on, the Department was ableto provide a continued supply of combined product to theprofession of either or both Hib/DTwP and Hib/DTaP.

As has been identified there is nota 'one size fits all' need. Some business units needsignificant help, others much less. The assessment would define: the needs of the business unit taking into account the risk and level of spend; theexperience/ qualifications required within the business unit;and, any gaps to be addressed. As a result of the assessment the business unit would be accredited to operate up to agreed spending limits withoutreferral to PPAU.The Department introduced its Procurement Management Policy , setting out clear roles and responsibilities for procurement. Since the report, the Department has workedmore closely with business units providing awareness trainingand identifying areas where their procurement capabilityneeded strengthening. The Department is looking at ways toimprove the routine monitoring of procurement activity inareas where there is significant commercial expenditure. The Department employed consultants, specialising in procurement, to carry out a pilot assessment and accreditationreview of the Policy Directorate. A similar external review isabout to be undertaken of a second Directorate as part of arolling programme.Monitoring of procurement activity with business units Assessment and accreditationPROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 41aannex dCo-ordination Facilitating co-ordination of procurement activities and promoting collaboration where beneficial: !Within the Department to exploit opportunities foraggregation and supplier management; !With external organisations and other governmentdepartments; and, !With the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency to handleprocurements that start with the Department of Healthbut then transfer to the NHS for execution. Driving forward the e-commerce agenda within theDepartment should be a management, co-ordination role as many of the actions will be in other parts of the Department. Maintaining professional standards in procurement across the Department and ensuring continuous professionaldevelopment. The Head of Procurement should act as head of profession for the Central Department. Improved management information will be a spin-off from the move to e-commerce. It is recommended that development of the required management informationsystems is held until there is clarity about what will becomeavailable through the e-commerce route.The Department has been exploring opportunities withother Departments as part of its normal business. Action has been targeted in the more general areas (for example:stationery and travel) and the Department now purchasesfrom NHS contracts for electricity, arranged by the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency. The Department piloted the OGC led initiative for e-tendering. OGC is reviewing the results of this exerciseand the Department is waiting to see how this will be takenforward. In the meantime, the Department is continuing tolook at ways of increasing the proportion of low valuetransactions carried out electronically. All PPAU staff have procurement qualifications and the Department encourages its buyers to gain the full Memberof the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (MCIPS)qualification. PPAU staffing levels have increased by 50%but there has been a steady loss of trained staff onpromotion. With increasing emphasis on procurementcapability in government generally, it has become moredifficult to recruit replacements from within the governmentcommunity and the Department is recruiting externally. Progress has been slow on e-tendering. This has meant that the accounting records remain the most reliablesource of expenditure incurred by the Department directly.This will be augmented in time by information from theaccreditation process.Government e-commerce agenda Professional standards Management Information42annex ePROCUREMENT OF VACCINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH Annex EExamination of vaccine procurement procedures We examined the eight most recent procurement exercises for the purchase of both programme and non-programmevaccines.
