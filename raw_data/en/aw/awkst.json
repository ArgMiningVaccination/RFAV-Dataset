During this time of shock and disbelief, crucial treatment decisions must be made. Involving patients in the decision- making process is an important and welcome trend, because it incorporates their values and preferences in situations where there are no black- and-white answers as to which path is best. This requires that the patient, family and friends be as informed as possible about the nature of the disease and the proposed care plan. Having the right tools and the ability to use them quickly and confidently can be quite a challenge, and not one that patients should have to confront alone. The 14th edition of CUR E\u00ae's Annual Cancer Guide for the Newly Diagnosed, produced in partnership with eight essential patient advocacy groups, provides a framework for understanding how cancers are diagnosed and staged, and for coping with emotions that arise after a cancer diagnosis. Treatments, and their benefits and side effects, are discussed, as are the rapid evolution of targeted biologic drugs and immunotherapies, and refinements in surgical and radiation techniques. Throughout the guide, survivors share advice on how to navigate the various phases of the cancer experience. The team of writers, editors and illustrators at CUR E\u00ae magazine, along with their collaborators at the patient advocacy groups, have delivered a timely and useful handbook that offers proven guidance through a difficult time. In this edition, we feature sections on seven specific cancer types, describing their causes, the diagnosis and treatment process, side effects of therapies and how these diseases affect the lives of patients. New among those is a section on myelofibrosis in patients who are newly diagnosed or have not been treated for it yet.An additional article identifies barriers to cancer care for underserved populations, as well as resources available to help overcome these issues. Further, the guide also shares updated insights on identifying genetic mutations that drive cancer and using targeted drugs to capitalize on these aberrations and kill cancer or slow its growth. For almost 20 years, CUR E\u00ae has combined science and humanity to promote learning, awareness and discourse about the challenges of cancer and the opportunities to improve options for patients and their loved ones. Quarterly and special issues of CUR E\u00ae focus on specific cancer types and highlight rapidly advancing science, technology and research, accompanied by thoughts about the emotional, practical and financial aspects of cancer \u2014 all of which are interrelated. A subscription to CUR E\u00ae magazine is free for patients with cancer, survivors and caregivers, as is the rich array of information we offer at curetoday.com , including breaking news, videos, podcasts and blogs. In our unique way, we hope to make cancer understandable and to support patients and the loved ones who care for them through every phase of the journey.

Understanding cancer means knowing it's more than one disease CANCER AFFECTS 1 IN 3 PEOPLE in the United States, so chances are you or someone you know has been affected by the disease. Humans are made up of trillions of cells that over a lifetime normally grow and divide as needed. When cells are abnormal or get old, they die. Cancer starts when something goes wrong in this process \u2014 the cells keep making new cells and the old or abnormal ones don't die when they should. As the cancer cells grow out of control, they can crowd out normal cells. This makes it hard for the body to work the way it should. For many people, cancer can be treated suc - cessfully. In fact, more people than ever before lead full lives after cancer treatment.CANCER IS MORE THAN ONE DISEASE Cancer can develop anywhere in the body and is named for the part of the body where it started. For instance, cancer that starts in the breast is still called breast cancer even if it spreads (metastasizes) to other parts of the body. There are two main categories of cancer: Hematologic (blood) cancers are cancers of the blood cells, including leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Solid tumor cancers are cancers of any of the other body organs or tissues. The most common solid tumors are breast, prostate, lung and colorectal cancers. ILLUSTRATION BY ERIN MOOREAdapted with permission of the American Cancer SocietyFind organizations that can teach you about your cancer type and offer disease-specific support. Visit the resources section of our Cancer Guide at curetoday.com/journey . PART 1: UNDERSTANDING CANCER13 These cancers are alike in some ways but can differ in the ways they grow, spread and respond to treatment. Some cancers grow and spread fast. Others grow more slowly. Some are more likely to spread to other parts of the body. Others stay where they started. Some types of cancer are best treated with sur - gery; others respond better to drugs such as chemotherapy. Often two or more treatments are used to get the best results. WHAT IS A TUMOR? A tumor is a lump or growth. Lumps that are not cancerous are called benign. Lumps that are cancerous are called malignant. What makes cancer different is that it can spread to other parts of the body, whereas benign tumors do not. Cancer cells can break away from the site where the cancer started. These cells can travel to other parts of the body, ending up in the lymph nodes or other body organs and causing problems with nor - mal functions. WHAT CAUSES CANCER? Cancer cells develop because of multiple changes in their genes. These changes can have many possible causes. Lifestyle habits, genetics and being exposed to cancer-causing agents in the environment can all play a role. Many times, there is no obvious cause. WHAT IS THE CANCER STAGE? When a cancer is found, tests are done to see how big the cancer is and whether it has spread from where it started. This is called the cancer's stage. A lower stage (such as a stage 1 or 2) means that the cancer has not spread very much. A higher number (such as a stage 3 or 4) means it has spread more. Stage 4 is the highest stage. CAUSE AND EFFECT HEREDITARY CANCER Hereditary cancers result from an inherited gene mutation or variation that is present in every cell and can be passed on to children. SPORADIC CANCER The majority of cancer diagnoses are considered sporadic. These tumors are the result of environmental exposures or possible random events within a cell. DAMAGE TO DNA LIQUID TUMORS Cancers of the blood cells, such as leukemias.SOLID TUMORS Solid tumors are named for the type of cells that form them. Examples include sarcomas and carcinomas.ILLUSTRATION BY ERIN MOOREWHAT IS CANCER? \u00bbThe stage of the cancer is very important in choos - ing the best treatment. HOW DOES CANCER SPREAD? Cancer may spread from where it started (the pri - mary site) to other parts of the body. When cancer cells break away from a tumor, they can travel to other areas of the body through either the bloodstream or the lymph system. Cancer cells can travel through the bloodstream to reach distant organs. If they travel through the lymph system, the cancer cells may end up in lymph nodes. Either way, most of the escaped cancer cells die or are killed before they can start growing somewhere else. But one or two might settle in a new area, begin to grow and form new tumors. This spread of cancer to a new part of the body is called metastasis.In order for cancer cells to spread to new parts of the body, they have to go through several changes. They first have to become able to break away from the original tumor and then attach to the outside wall of a lymph vessel or blood vessel. Then they must move through the vessel wall to flow with the blood or lymph to a new organ or lymph node. WHERE IS HELP AVAILABLE?

Many patients tell the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network, \"I had no idea you could get cancer in your blad - der until my doctor told me that's what I had. \" Yet each year more than 80,000 Americans will receive that diagnosis. WHAT IS BLADDER CANCER? Bladder cancer is also known as urothelial carcinoma. Urothelial cells line the urinary tract, including the ure - thra, bladder, and ureters and renal pelvis in the kidneys. These urothelial or transitional cells are in contact with urine. Bladder cancer happens when those cells in the bladder start to grow out of control. WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS? Smoking and being exposed to secondhand smoke increas - es the risk of developing bladder cancer. In addition, people exposed to occupational or environmental chemicals may have a higher risk of developing bladder cancer. White people are twice as likely to develop bladder can - cer as are Black people or Hispanic people, and older age is another risk factor. Health history also matters, with chronic bladder inflam - mation, such as urinary tract infections or kidney stones, as well as a personal or family history of bladder cancer, associated with risk of the disease. Learn more about the signs, symptoms and risk factors for bladder cancer at bcan.org/bladder-cancer-signs- symptoms-risk-factors/ . WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS? Many people are unaware of the common signs of bladder cancer, such as blood in the urine, known as hematuria. If blood in the urine can be seen, this is called gross hematuria. When a physician runs a urinalysis test as part of a routine checkup, tiny amounts of blood may be detected. This is microscopic hematuria. Any blood seen in the urine should be checked by a physician. Irritation when urinating, urgency and frequency are other warning signs. These signs may also be from other causes, such as a urinary tract infection, kidney stones or aging. HOW IS BLADDER CANCER DIAGNOSED AND STAGED? A urologist will make a bladder cancer diagnosis. Urologists use a cystoscope to examine the lining of the bladder and the tube that carries urine out of the body (urethra). If bladder cancer is diagnosed, the doctor needs to know the stage, or extent, of the disease to plan the best treatment. Staging is a careful attempt to find out whether the cancer has invaded the bladder wall or spread beyond that, and, if so, to what parts of the body. Grade refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look and how many cells are multiplying. A higher grade means the cells are more uneven and are multiplying more. Knowing the grade can help your doctor predict how quickly the cancer will grow and spread. Doctors usually describe and treat bladder cancer by how far it has grown into the bladder wall. NMIBC (non-muscle invasive bladder cancer) is cancer that remains in the urothelial cells that line the bladder. MIBC (muscle-invasive bladder cancer) is cancer that has grown into the deeper layers of bladder muscle. If bladder cancer has spread to other parts of the body outside the urinary tract, it is advanced disease, or metastatic. HOW IS BLADDER CANCER TREATED? When bladder cancer is classified as NMIBC, surgery to remove the tumor is often the first step. A transurethral resection of the bladder tumor uses a special instrument inserted through the urethra to remove the tumor. If the tumor is low risk/grade and has not invaded the muscle wall of the bladder, it may not require more treatment. Unfortunately, bladder cancer has a high rate of recurrence so most of those who receive diagnoses must return to their urologist at regular intervals for surveillance using cystos - copy to see if the tumors return. If the tumor cells appear aggressive under the micro - scope and the pathologist determines that the cancer is high risk/grade, it is more likely to return or worsen. In these cases, further treatment to keep the cancer from returning or worsening is required. Most often, patients with high-grade NMIBC receive intravesical (inside the bladder) treatments. Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) is an early form of immunotherapy that uses a weakened form of bacteria. When these bacteria are put into the bladder, the immune system goes on alert. It responds by killing can - cer cells on the bladder lining. Though BCG is very effective, PART 1: UNDERSTANDING CANCER In collaboration with \u00bb16 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONBLADDER CANCER it doesn't work for all tumors. If BCG doesn't work, there are other options such as mitomycin C, an antibiotic that helps fight tumors. When bladder cancer grows into the deeper layers of the bladder (MIBC), it is more difficult to treat. In many cases, a urologist may suggest radial cystectomy, which is surgery to remove your bladder. Removing the bladder also involves removing lymph nodes around the organ. As part of the sur - gery, it will be necessary to create a urinary diversion, a new way for urine to leave your body. Systemic chemotherapy is medicine that treats cancer throughout the whole body. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is chemotherapy patients get before bladder removal surgery. Clinical trials have shown that cisplatin chemotherapy before bladder removal improves survival for patients with MIBC because it helps kill bladder cancer cells that may be outside the bladder. Adjuvant chemotherapy is the chemotherapy patients get after surgery.Recently approved targeted therapies can block the growth and spread of cancer. They focus on stopping the cancer- driving activity caused by specific genetic mutations that are found in some bladder cancers. Some patients may benefit from combined modality therapy, which uses surgery to remove the tumor, plus che - motherapy and radiation to help kill the cancer while keep - ing the bladder intact. This option can be used for some patients who are ineligible for bladder removal surgery. Those with advanced or metastatic disease may benefit from chemotherapy and a variety of immunotherapies that can help the body fight off the cancer. There are many talented researchers and clinicians working to improve the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Clinical trials are an essential part of bladder cancer research. They may provide treatment alternatives to patients who have not had success with standard and approved therapies. To learn more and find a trial, visit clinicaltrials.bcan.org . WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS OF TREATMENT? Every treatment for bladder cancer has potential side effects. Some, such as systemic chemotherapy, are well known because they are similar across all cancers (hair loss, nausea, fatigue and infections). Others are related to sur - geries (bleeding, catherization and continence issues). The newer immunotherapy treatments approved for bladder cancer can offer great promise to patients, but side effects such as diarrhea or nausea can be signs of life-threatening reactions when using these drugs. All these possibilities should be discussed with the medical team and considered carefully before treatment options are selected. HOW DOES BLADDER CANCER AFFECT A PATIENT'S LIFE? Bladder cancer has a high rate of recurrence, which implies the need for regular surveillance with cystoscopy over the course of a patient's lifetime. For some patients, the new normal after bladder removal surgery is adjusting to life with a urinary diversion. A patient should always feel comfortable talking with their health care team about any issues or questions. If the team can't help, they can usually find someone who can. WHERE IS HELP AVAILABLE?

CONVIT / STOCK.ADOBE.COM DAVID A LITMAN / ADOBE STOCK.ADOBE.COMChronic Lymphocytic Leukemia CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults and has been the focus of headlines over the past few years because of enormous progress in its treatment. In 2015, the American Society of Clinical Oncology recognized these developments as its Cancer Advance of the Year. Four targeted drugs had been approved, giving patients with CLL treatments that are more effective and produced fewer side effects than older therapies. Those improvements introduced meaningful options for older patients who likely could not have withstood the harsher regimens of the past. They also made it more pos - sible to treat CLL long term as a chronic condition. But what exactly is CLL? What are the warning signs, and who should be on the lookout for them? WHAT IS CLL? CLL originates in the bone marrow where cells form blood. This causes blood cells to produce B lymphocytes, a type of white blood cells that are not normal, healthy or able to effectively fight infection. These leukemia cells may look basically nor - mal under a microscope, but they may reproduce too rapidly, survive longer than normal cells and crowd out healthy white blood cells. CLL cells may also grow in the lymph nodes and the spleen. Eventually, the cancerous cells may spill into the blood - stream and reach a threshold that defines the patient as having CLL, though it may be years before any symptoms arise. Each year, approximately 21,000 people receive a diag - nosis of CLL and approximately 4,500 die from the disease. The average risk of developing CLL is approximately 1 in 175. Scientists are not certain what causes the disease but have identified some risk factors. People over age 50 have a higher likelihood of developing CLL and so do those people who have had significant exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange. People with a family history of the disease among first-degree relatives, people living in North America and Europe compared with those in Asia and men in general all are also at higher risk. However, screening for the disease is not recommended because most cases are random without any clear risk factor. Also, most patients receive diagnoses of early- to intermediate-stage CLL and can be treated with a watch- and-wait strategy. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS? Among people with CLL, 80% have no symptoms when they receive their diagnosis. Typically, the disease is found when a blood test ordered for an unrelated health condition or a routine checkup reveals a high number of lymphocytes. In CLL, the overall white blood cell count also may be elevated. It doesn't happen often, but patients sometimes detect CLL themselves. They may notice enlarged lymph nodes, which feel like lumps, typically in the neck or above the PART 1: UNDERSTANDING CANCER DAVID A LITMAN / ADOBE STOCK Most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia can be treated with a watch-and-wait strategy.In collaboration with \u00bb18 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONCHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA collarbone, or in the armpits or groin. As the disease pro - gresses, other symptoms may emerge: fatigue, weight loss, chills, unexplained fever, night sweats and bleeding or bruising easily, as well as an enlarged spleen or liver that causes gastrointestinal symptoms and increased risk of infections. Those symptoms warrant a visit to a doctor. Any lymph node that reaches a width of two fingers or more should be evaluated if it persists. An enlarged node may accompany a cold or the flu, so it's reasonable to wait until the illness resolves to see if the node shrinks to its normal size. HOW IS CLL DIAGNOSED AND STAGED? Unlike most leukemias, CLL does not require a bone mar - row aspiration for diagnosis; rather, a doctor can check for the disease via blood tests. CT scans are also usually not needed at time of diagnosis. Doctors determine how advanced the disease is by using a staging system based on the presence of any enlarged lymph nodes in addition to lymphocytes; an enlarged liver or spleen; low hemoglobin, also known as anemia; or a low count of platelets, blood cells that help form clots to stop bleeding. That assessment doesn't reveal everything doctors need to know, however. Approximately 30% of patients will never need treatment for their CLL; to differentiate, doctors conduct prognostic tests on leukemia cells cir - culating in the blood. Chromosome analysis and other blood tests can suggest the likelihood of disease pro - gression in the near future because certain chromosome abnormalities in CLL cells are known to be favorable for slow-moving disease and some for the opposite. Genetic tests may be used to look for a mutated immu - noglobulin gene, present in 50% of patients with CLL, which indicates that the disease will progress more slow - ly. Testing for mutations of TP53 is recommended before any treatment because it can help determine which therapies are the most appropriate. HOW IS CLL TREATED? Treatment for CLL typically includes single drugs or combi - nations of medications. The many possible options include oral targeted drugs (kinase inhibitors and BCL-2 blockers) and chemoimmunotherapy, in which an intravenous mono - clonal antibody is given with chemotherapy. Experimental drugs or novel combinations of new and old drugs, given in clinical trials, or \"off label, \" may be a good option. Patients who have experienced disease progression while taking other lines of therapy might consider a stem cell transplant. In some very rare circumstances, the spleen or lymph nodes become so enlarged that treatment with radiation or surgery might be warranted. All drugs can have side effects, and each drug in each class has a different side effect profile. BTK (Bruton tyrosine kinase) inhibitors are oral targeted therapies that have revolutionized the care of CLL. Their side effects may include low white blood cell counts, increased risk of infection, bleeding, musculoskeletal pain, hypertension, mouth sores, nausea, rash and headaches. PI3K inhibitors may cause diarrhea, liver inflammation, colitis, lung inflammation and infections, rash and low white blood cell counts. When first started, BCL-2 block - ers can cause tumor lysis syndrome by killing the cancer so quickly that the body can't cope, and this can later cause low blood counts, pneumonia and other infections. Monoclonal antibodies can cause reactions at the time of the infusions, plus diarrhea, nausea, constipation, fatigue, shortness of breath, increased risk of new or reactivated infections such as hepatitis B and a drop in blood counts. Chemotherapy for CLL may be associated with bone mar - row, nerve, heart or bladder damage, low blood counts, hair loss, nausea and increased risk of second cancers. HOW DOES CLL AFFECT A PATIENT'S LIFE? Even in the early stage of disease, patients with CLL have diminished immune systems. It's important for them to alert their care team if they believe they're getting an infection, even if it's just a cold. Patients with CLL have a high rate of hospitalization and even death from COVID-19 infections and should follow all the guidelines to minimize their risk. Vaccinations should be reviewed and updated, but patients should receive no live vaccines. Also, age- and sex-appropriate cancer screening is recommended as patients are at higher risk of a second cancer, especially skin cancers. With attention to these kinds of details and the new therapies available for advanced CLL, it is now possible for some with the disease to achieve an average life span. In fact, new treatments and better understanding of the biol - ogy of the disease are improving outcomes for nearly all patients with CLL, regardless of their age or risk factors.

US-35328_US-34063 Calquence 3:50 PM21 Lung Cancer LUNG CANCER IS THE LEADING CAUSE of cancer death among men and women. Tobacco is the biggest risk fac - tor for lung cancer, but approximately 20% of people who receive a diagnosis have never smoked or used any other form of tobacco. Many new therapies, including targeted drugs and immu - notherapies, have been approved in recent years to treat lung cancer, improving outcomes for many with the disease. WHAT IS LUNG CANCER? Lung cancer occurs when cells inside the lungs grow out of control. The cancer can start in the bronchi, the tubes that allow air to move from the trachea into the lungs; bronchioles, the tiny tubes that carry air farther inside the lungs; or alveoli, the air sacs within the lungs. There are two types of lung cancer: non-small cell and small cell. Non-small cell lung cancer, by far the most common type, is divided into three subtypes. Adenocarcinoma starts in the cells that secrete sub - stances such as mucus. Although it occurs mainly in people who have smoked, it's also the most common kind of lung cancer in people who never smoked. It is found in the outer part of the lungs and most likely to be discovered before it has spread. Squamous cell carcinoma occurs in the center of the lungs in cells that line the inside of the airway and is often linked with a history of smoking. Large cell, or undifferentiated, lung cancer can appear anywhere in the lungs and tends to grow and spread aggressively. Small cell lung cancer tends to grow and spread faster than non-small cell lung cancer. More treatments are available for non-small cell lung cancer than for small cell lung cancer. WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS? Smoking is the leading risk factor for lung cancer. Others include secondhand smoke; exposure to radon, asbestos or workplace chemicals; radiation therapy to the lungs; air pollution; and a personal or family history of lung cancer. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS? Lung cancer often causes no symptoms until it has grown past the early stage. Symptoms can include a persistent, worsening cough that may bring up blood; chest pain, especially with deep breathing or laughing; hoarseness; of appetite; shortness of breath; fatigue; wheezing; and bronchitis or pneumonia. Lung cancer that spreads to other parts of the body can cause bone pain, such as in the back or hips; nervous sys - tem changes such as headache, dizziness or seizures; yel - lowed skin or eyes; or swollen lymph nodes. HOW IS LUNG CANCER DIAGNOSED AND STAGED? Most lung cancers are found because a patient has symptoms, although some are detected through screen - ing. Health insurers will cover periodic screening via low- dose CT scan for people with a history of heavy smoking. Screening can reveal lung cancers when they are still too small to cause symptoms and are more likely to be curable. If lung cancer is caught before it spreads, the likelihood of surviving five years increases to 60%. Although only low-dose CT scans are recommended to screen for lung cancer, doctors who suspect lung cancer can use a chest X-ray, MRI, positron emission tomography scan or bone scan, which uses radioactive material to pin - point abnormal areas. If any of those points to lung cancer, pathologists can look at the cells to determine whether they are cancerous. The cells can be from mucus coughed up from the lungs, fluid removed from the area around the lungs, or a needle or surgical biopsy of lung tissue. If cancer is present, determining whether it has spread past the lungs can be revealed through additional tests: ultrasound of the lymph nodes; mediastinoscopy or mediasti - notomy, which checks between the lungs; and thoracoscopy, which checks the spaces between the lungs and chest wall. Patients with lung cancer should request that their treating physician conduct comprehensive biomarker, or genomic, testing of their tumor tissue, which can help determine which treatments are likely to be most effective. Genomic testing looks for altered genes that drive cancer and can be treated with targeted therapies. There are approved targeted therapies for alterations in these genes: EGFR, ALK, ROS1, RET , NTRK, MET and BRAF. Testing may also look for gene alterations that do not have approved therapies but have drugs being tested in clinical trials. Comprehensive biomarker testing includes looking at levels of certain pro - teins called PD-1 and PD-L1, which may influence whether a patient should receive immunotherapy. In collaboration withPART 1: UNDERSTANDING CANCER \u00bb22 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONLUNG CANCER Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into stages from 0, the least advanced, through 4, the most advanced. Small cell lung cancer is divided into two stages: limited and extensive. HOW IS LUNG CANCER TREATED? Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer For early-stage disease, surgically removing part of the lung may be the only treatment needed. Surgery may be followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation. Treatment for stage 2 non-small cell lung cancer entails surgical removal of part or all of the affected lung and any cancerous lymph nodes followed by chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer. The mainstays of stage 3 treatment are chemotherapy and radiation given together, sometimes followed by sur - gery if the cancer can be removed, and then more chemo - therapy and radiation. If the cancer has grown too much to be completely removed by surgery, chemotherapy and radiation alone may control or even cure it. These treat - ments may be followed by immunotherapy to help keep the disease stable. Stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer has spread exten - sively and is difficult to cure. The goal of treatment is to prolong life and increase physical comfort. Therapies are selected based on the number of tumors and their loca - tion. The same treatments used in earlier stages, plus tar - geted therapies and immunotherapies, can be considered depending on the results of tests on the tumor cells. Some of these newer biological therapies can extend lives. Small Cell Lung Cancer Chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the chest are typi - cal treatments; sometimes surgery is performed first, but it is not possible in many cases. Radiation therapy to the head may be used to help pre - vent the cancer's spread to the brain. If the cancer is extensive, chemotherapy plus immu - notherapy is usually the first treatment. This may be fol - lowed with radiation to the chest and brain. Clinical trials of new treatments can be considered for either limited or extensive small cell lung cancers, which may shrink significantly with standard therapy but have a high likelihood of recurring. WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS OF TREATMENT? Side effects of surgery can include pain, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing. Chemotherapy can cause low blood counts that can lead to infection, nausea, diarrhea, hair loss, fatigue, mouth sores and numbness or tingling in the extremities. Those who receive radiation may expe - rience mild skin reactions, nausea, fatigue or sore throat. Targeted drugs can cause high blood pressure, bleeding, headaches, mouth sores, diarrhea, skin problems, consti - pation, vision changes and dizziness. Immunotherapy can cause fatigue, nausea, cough, itching, joint pain, consti - pation and diarrhea. A palliative care specialist can help patients with lung cancer manage side effects at all stages. HOW DOES LUNG CANCER AFFECT A PATIENT'S LIFE? Lung cancer stigma can affect patients who are seeking support. Symptoms from the disease or side effects that arise from treatment can affect quality of life, so patients should talk with their providers about the importance of emotional and physical support during this time.

SINHYU / STOCK.ADOBE.COM A diagnosis of lung cancer before it spreads can increase the likelihood of five-year survival to 60%.23 SINHYU / STOCK.ADOBE.COM Ovarian Cancer OVARIAN CANCER IS DIFFICUL T to diagnose early. There is no good screening method for detecting it, and its symp - toms often mirror those of a normal menstrual cycle or other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome. Most women with ovarian cancer receive the diagnosis after their disease has reached advanced stages. But just one in 78 women will get ovarian cancer, making it a rare disease. WHAT IS OVARIAN CANCER? Cancer arises when cells begin to grow out of control. Historically, ovarian cancer was thought to begin in the ovaries, but it is now known that most cases of ovarian cancer begin in the fallopian tube. Three types of cells can lead to separate subtypes of ovar - ian cancer: epithelial, germ cell and stromal. Up to 90% of ovarian cancers are epithelial, which has four subtypes: serous carcinoma (the most common), clear cell carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma and endometrioid carcinoma. WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS? Being postmenopausal is a risk factor for ovarian cancer, as is older age. Having a first full-term pregnancy after age 35 or never carrying a pregnancy to term is also associated with a higher risk. Taking estrogen without also taking progesterone for five to 10 years after menopause can also raise risk. Family history is another important factor. Women with family members who have ovarian, breast, colorectal or cer - tain other cancers, as well as women who have a personal history of breast cancer, may be at higher risk of ovarian cancer. Women who have inherited mutations in specific genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, RAD51C/D or the Lynch syndrome genes, are at higher risk for ovarian cancer. Although some women have an inherited risk of ovarian cancer, most ovarian cancers are due to mutations in ovarian, fallopian or peritoneal cells that a woman acquires during her lifetime. The causes of acquired mutations associated with ovarian cancer remain unknown; they may occur by chance over a woman's lifetime. Study results are not clear about the role of other factors, such as being obese or using in vitro fer- tilization drugs, as potential contributors to the development of ovarian cancer. Breastfeeding and using birth control pills can lower the risk of ovarian cancer. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS? The most common symptoms of ovarian cancer are bloat - ing, pelvic or abdominal pain, feeling full quickly when eating and having to urinate more urgently or more often. Other symptoms include fatigue, back pain, pain during sex, upset stomach, constipation, changes to bleeding dur - ing the menstrual period and belly swelling accompanied by weight loss. In many cases, these symptoms do not indicate ovarian cancer. However, if you have any of these symp - toms, it is important to get them checked out by a doctor if they are a change from your normal experience or occur more than 12 times in a month. HOW IS OVARIAN CANCER DIAGNOSED AND STAGED? No screening test for ovarian cancer is considered accurate enough to use on the general population. A manual pelvic exam can reveal several health problems but is likely to miss many ovarian cancers. Those at high risk of ovarian cancer may be screened with transvaginal ultrasound, which can find a mass in the pelvis but not determine whether it is cancerous. A blood test for elevated levels of the cancer antigen (CA)-125, a protein, is useful in women known to have ovarian cancer but is not an accurate way to diagnose the disease. High CA-125 levels can occur in people who have conditions unrelated to ovarian cancer, and tests for this antigen can miss people with ovar - ian cancer who don't express a lot of this protein. If screening or symptoms suggest ovarian cancer, a doc - tor will use imaging to look for a tumor. This can include CT , MRI or positron emission tomography scans or laparoscopy, in which a thin, lighted tube is threaded through a small abdominal incision to send images of the ovaries and other pelvic organs to a video monitor. If a mass is found, a piece will need to be removed (biop - sied), usually surgically, and then analyzed in a lab. If ovarian cancer is present, it will be given a stage ranging from 1 (indi - cating that the cancer hasn't spread beyond the site of ori - gin) to 4 (indicating that it has spread to distant parts of the body). These cancers are also assigned a grade of 1 through 3 or classified as low grade or high grade to indicate how differ - ent from normal the cancer cells are. High-grade cancers are more likely to grow quickly and spread. A patient who receives a diagnosis of ovarian cancer should undergo genetic testing using blood or saliva to find out if an inherited gene mutation is the cause of the disease. This information can help guide treatment, alert a woman that she should be screened for additional cancers and make family members aware that they might also have an inher - ited predisposition to cancer.In collaboration with PART 1: UNDERSTANDING CANCER \u00bb24 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONOVARIAN CANCER HOW IS OVARIAN CANCER TREATED? Most ovarian cancers are treated the same way regard - less of stage: surgery followed by chemotherapy. Stromal tumors are treated with surgery followed by chemothera - py or hormone therapy. In most cases, the surgery removes the tumor, or as much of it as possible, plus the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries. Chemotherapy is sometimes given directly into the abdominal cavity rather than by infusion into the bloodstream through an arm. If a woman isn't well enough to undergo surgery, she may get chemotherapy first and then have surgery when she is able. In some cases, if the cancer has spread far beyond the ovary \u2014 for instance, to the liver \u2014 chemotherapy may be given before surgery to shrink the can - cer and make surgery easier. In later-stage disease, surgery may involve removing the lining and boundary tissues from inside the upper abdomen, as well as parts of the intestines, liver, bladder or gallbladder. Maintenance Therapy for Ovarian Cancer Maintenance therapy is a type of treatment given after chemotherapy has been completed to try to keep the cancer from returning. The goal of maintenance therapy is to extend the length of time before the cancer returns or even to turn a temporary remission into a long-term cure. Two types of drugs \u2014 poly adenosine diphosphate- ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and the targeted drug Avastin (bevacizumab) \u2014 have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use as maintenance therapies in women with advanced ovarian, fallopian tube and pri - mary peritoneal cancer if they have an inherited or tumor mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 or if the ovarian cancer has a tumor feature called homologous recombination repair deficiency. A relatively new type of ovarian cancer treat - ment, PARP inhibitors are oral drugs that block the PARP enzyme, which cells use to repair DNA damage. Clinical tri - als of other PARP inhibitors or new therapies may also be an option for some patients. Treatment for Other Types of Ovarian Cancers Germ cell tumors are also treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy. Stromal tumors are treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy or hormone therapy. WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS OF TREATMENT? Women who were not in menopause before surgery for ovar - ian cancer will experience it afterward, which can bring on symptoms such as hot flashes, sweats, fatigue and skin and vaginal dryness. There are treatments available to alleviate some of these symptoms. Younger women also may experi - ence distress over their loss of fertility following surgery. Some women whose lymph nodes were removed may experi - ence lymphedema, a pooling of fluid in nearby parts of the body. Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer can cause hair loss, nau - sea and vomiting, diarrhea and/ or constipation, and tingling or weakness in the extremities. It can also result in fatigue, a feeling of brain fog and low blood counts that can lead to infection. PARP inhibitors can cause fatigue, nau - sea and low blood counts. HOW DOES OVARIAN CANCER AFFECT A PATIENT'S LIFE? Patients with ovarian cancer that has spread to other parts of the body can experience remission after treatment but are likely to face a recur - rence that requires additional therapy. This can cause worry and disappointment. Women who were not in meno - pause before surgery will experience it afterward, which can be a big adjustment. If a woman finds out that her disease stems from an inherited gene mutation, it could mean she is predisposed to other kinds of cancer and should consider more fre - quent screenings or preventive treatment, such as lifestyle changes, medicine or surgery. Patients with inherited predispositions to cancer are encouraged to share that information with family members so they can seek genetic testing and counseling. WHERE IS HELP AVAILABLE?

DAVID A LITMAN / STOCK.ADOBE.COM ELENA / STOCK.ADOBE.COM25 Prostate Cancer AFFECTING ONE IN EIGHT MEN , prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men after skin cancer. In many cases, prostate cancer grows relatively slowly, often taking years to become large enough to be detect - able and even longer to spread outside the prostate. Some cases are more aggressive and need more urgent treat - ment. Fortunately, there are many treatment options for all stages of the disease. WHAT IS PROSTATE CANCER? Prostate cancer starts in the prostate, a small gland located below the bladder that is responsible for secreting one of the components of semen. Prostate cells may grow out of control and become cancerous when stimulated by male hormones, including testosterone. WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS? Men who are older, are Black, have a family history of the disease or have certain inherited genes are at higher risk for prostate cancer. Lifestyle matters, too: Smoking increases the risk of fatal prostate cancer and excess body weight increases the risk of aggressive and fatal prostate cancer. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS? Prostate cancer rarely causes symptoms. When it does, symptoms can include frequent urination or other urinary issues, problems with erection or ejaculation, weakness or numbness in the legs and feet and pressure or pain in the rectum or pelvis. Because symptoms are uncommon, it's important that men make a prostate cancer screening plan with their doctor. HOW IS PROSTATE CANCER DIAGNOSED AND STAGED? The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test and digital rectal exam (DRE) can be used to detect prostate cancer when no symptoms are present. They may catch the disease at an early stage when treatment may be more effective and potentially have fewer side effects. Average-risk men should talk to their doctor about PSA screening at 45; Black men and those with a strong family history of prostate or other cancers should have this discussion at 40. If the PSA is elevated, a doctor may order an MRI or other tests. A needle biopsy \u2014 commonly done through the rectum, or, increasingly, through the perineum \u2014 is needed to estab - lish the diagnosis. If cancer is detected, doctors assess its stage using five important pieces of information: Treating prostate cancer depends on a patient's risk and preferences.In collaboration with PART 1: UNDERSTANDING CANCER \u00bbDAVID A LITMAN / STOCK.ADOBE.COM ELENA / STOCK.ADOBE.COM26 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONPROSTATE CANCER How much and how quickly PSA rises over time. How aggressive the cancer cells look under a microscope, expressed as a Gleason score (range of 6-10; 10 is the most abnormal) or a Grade Group score (range of 1-5). Number of biopsy cores, or samples, with cancer. Whether the cancer cells are limited to inside the pros - tate or have spread into the neighboring pelvic areas. Whether the cancer has invaded lymph nodes and/or spread to more distant parts of the body. Localized and locally advanced prostate cancer (cancer that is in the prostate or the region around it) is assigned a risk group ranging from very low to very high based on these criteria. Doctors may recommend patients with high- risk or metastatic cancer may receive a recommendation to have additional testing of their tumor for gene mutations (e.g., alterations to BRCA1 or BRCA2), as well as genetic testing for inherited cancer risk. HOW IS PROSTATE CANCER TREATED? There is no single approach to treating prostate cancer. Treatment options depend upon the risk group and patient factors and preferences. A patient who receives a diagnosis of localized or locally advanced prostate cancer has three primary treatment options: Active surveillance: Follow the cancer closely with reg - ularly scheduled PSA checks, DREs, MRIs and biopsies so that definitive treatment is administered only if and when necessary. This is an option for patients with low- risk disease and for select patients with intermediate- risk prostate cancer. Surgery: Remove the entire prostate gland and seminal vesicles (radical prostatectomy). This is an option for men with intermediate- or high-risk cancer that has not spread. Radiation therapy: Precisely kill cancer cells with ion - izing radiation. As with surgery, it is very effective for localized or locally advanced prostate cancer and has the same cure rate as surgery. For men with more-aggressive disease, certain treatment combinations may be recommended. Hormone therapy may be added. Also known as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), this medication stops testosterone from being produced or directly blocks it from acting on prostate cancer cells. In some cases, at initial diagnosis, prostate cancer is already aggressive and is metastatic, meaning it has spread outside the prostate. Furthermore, in men who already have been treated for prostate cancer, it can recur. Fortunately, men with advanced prostate cancer have several treatment options, including ADT alone or in combination with newer, second-generation anti-androgen medications. For patients with a low volume of metastatic disease at diagnosis, radia - tion therapy may be combined with ADT . Chemotherapy drugs can help manage pain and may improve survival in patients with metastatic disease. Other, newer treatments include immunotherapy drugs known as checkpoint inhibi - tors; a vaccine for prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (sipuleucel-T; Provenge); treatments tar - geting cancer in the bones, such as radium-223; and poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibi - tors, which were approved in 2020. WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS OF TREATMENT? Localized prostate cancer and its treatments can dis - rupt normal urinary, bowel and sexual functioning. Prostatectomy may result in urinary incontinence or leak - age. Nearly all men will have some form of leakage imme - diately after the surgery, but this can improve over time and with strengthening exercises. Radiation therapy may cause a mild increase in urinary frequency and urgency and/or the need to urinate at night. Erectile dysfunction remains the most common side effect after treatment. Fortunately, there are many excel - lent treatments for managing erectile function. After sur - gery or radiation, men are unlikely to be fertile. Treatment of advanced disease carries other side effects. ADT causes side effects related to reversing all of the normal functions of testosterone. Although most men may experience only a few of these symptoms, the list of potential effects is long, including hot flashes, decreased sexual desire, metabolic changes, and changes in mood and thinking. For chemotherapy, reactions to drugs can vary widely, so it's important to pay attention to any side effects \u2014 the most serious, but uncommon, being fever with a low white blood cell count. HOW DOES PROSTATE CANCER AFFECT A PATIENT'S LIFE? The two most common side effects of treatment for localized prostate cancer are incontinence and erectile dysfunction. They can be managed and may be temporary, but for those affected, learning to live with these issues can be challenging. Men on active surveillance to monitor early-stage prostate cancer face a small risk that the disease will become aggres - sive and spread, and some may feel worried about this. It's important that patients make mindful everyday choices about diet and lifestyle. There is growing scientific evidence that good nutrition and moderate to vigorous exercise may actually slow the growth and progression of prostate cancer. WHERE IS HELP AVAILABLE?

Because of progress in its treatment, many patients can live with myeloma as they would a chronic disease, treat - ing it with medicine over a number of years. WHAT IS MUL TIPLE MYELOMA? Multiple myeloma develops when plasma cells grow out of control with the capacity to spread and sometimes become resistant to treatments. Plasma cells, a type of blood cell, are found in bone marrow (the soft inside part of bones) and are part of the immune system. These cells start out as lymphocytes, including B cells that mature into antibody-producing plasma cells when they fight an infection. When these cells grow out of control, they produce an abnormal protein known as monoclonal protein, or M pro - tein. The same protein is also known as monoclonal immu - noglobulin, M spike or paraprotein. This is the hallmark of multiple myeloma. The uncontrolled growth of myeloma cells crowds other blood-forming cells out of bone marrow, leading to low blood counts and a decreased ability to fight certain infections. It can also interfere with cells that keep bones strong. M protein can circulate in the blood and lead to organ damage, including the kidney and nerve cells. WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS? Being older is a risk factor for myeloma; the average age at diagnosis is 69. Being male, obese or Black also are risk factors. A family history of the disease slightly raises risk, but most people who get myeloma do not have relatives with the disease. Having other plasma cell diseases such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, which is con - sidered a precursor to myeloma, also raises risk. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS? Myeloma often causes no symptoms until it reaches advanced stages, or it might cause vague symptoms that can be confused with those generated by other conditions. Sometimes patients receive a diagnosis when a routine blood test shows an abnormally high level of M protein. Those who experience symptoms might have bone pain, weakness or breaks; low blood counts that cause ane -mia or excessive bleeding; high calcium levels that cause extreme thirst; sudden severe back pain or leg weakness due to broken bones in the spine; numbness or tingling in the extremities; thick blood, which can cause confusion or dizziness; shortness of breath, weakness or leg swelling due to kidney damage; or infections such as pneumonia. HOW IS MUL TIPLE MYELOMA DIAGNOSED AND STAGED? Doctors who suspect myeloma will conduct a series of blood and urine tests to check blood counts and kidney function in addition to protein, calcium and antibody levels. If these numbers suggest that myeloma is present, doctors will take a bone marrow biopsy. This can be done by inserting a needle into the back of the pelvic bone and taking out a core \u2014 approximately the size of the tip of a lead pencil\u2014 that contains a small amount of marrow. This allows a pathologist to look for myeloma cells. An X-ray, MRI, CT or positron emission tomography scan can sometimes show bone changes or destruction caused by myeloma. An echocardiogram might be used to check heart func - tion, which can be affected by myeloma. To diagnose myeloma, a doctor must find malignant plasma cells or 10% plasma cells in the bone marrow and at least one of the following: high blood calcium level, poor kidney function, anemia, holes or lesions in the bones, a specific level of increase in one type of light chain antibody fragment in the blood, or 60% or more plasma cells in the bone marrow. Myeloma is classified in stages 1 through 3, with 3 hav - ing spread the farthest and representing the highest risk. Additional genetic and chromosomal testing can help deter - mine treatment. HOW IS MUL TIPLE MYELOMA TREATED? If there is only one tumor in tissue or bone, a patient may be treated with radiation or surgery. If there is more than one tumor, patients are treated with a combination of drugs \u2014 typically, two types of tar - geted drugs plus a steroid. In some cases, a chemotherapy is included in the mix. Sometimes patients stay on one of the targeted drugs longer to help prevent a relapse. Patients with bone disease also get a bisphosphonate, which slows bone loss and lowers the risk of fracture. They also may receive radiation. DAVID A LITMAN / STOCK.ADOBE.COMIn collaboration withPART / STOCK.ADOBE.COMThose with myeloma also receive supportive treatments, such as transfusions to deal with low blood counts and antibiotics to fight infection. After a number of rounds of combination drugs, some patients undergo stem cell transplant preceded by high-dose chemotherapy, and this is sometimes followed by more medi - cal treatment. Smoldering myeloma, a precursor to myeloma that doesn't always progress, is treated with close observa - tion, although there is evidence that treating these patients with medications when they are asymptomatic extends their lives and may decrease organ damage. More research is needed on this. All patients getting treatment undergo monitoring of their disease status with checks of organ function and blood tests to measure the proteins made by myeloma cells. Scans also may be done, and together these tests can indicate whether the treatment is working or if a change in the therapy regimen is needed. WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS OF TREATMENT? The side effects of radiation can include skin irritation or blistering, fatigue, nausea or diarrhea, numbness or tingling in the extremities, increased risk of blood clots and low blood cell counts, which can lead to infection. Surgery may cause temporary weakness, swelling, pain and infection. Chemotherapy can cause fatigue, nausea, vomiting, mouth sores and low blood cell counts. Steroids can gen - erate a feeling of hunger, trouble sleeping, loss of muscle mass, upset stomach and swelling in the extremities. Patients taking combinations of targeted drugs might experience fatigue, nausea or vomiting, constipation, diar - rhea, a low white blood cell count, rash, blood clots, mus - cle aches and numbness or tingling in the extremities. HOW DOES MUL TIPLE MYELOMA AFFECT A PATIENT'S LIFE? For some patients, multiple myeloma can progress in severity and over time the disease can become resistant to treatment with many approved therapies. For these patients, it is important to be seen by a myeloma special - ist who can provide the most updated information on new treatments and clinical trials that may be appropri - ate for them. For many, multiple myeloma can be managed like a chronic condition, with medicine given for years. Others who have no detectable cancer after initial treatment for myeloma may move forward without medication unless their disease recurs. Symptoms such as bone pain and loss, kidney problems, anemia and infection may interfere with everyday life and require palliative treatment. For many patients, involve - ment of the bone may cause lost height or change the cur - vature of the spine. WHERE IS HELP AVAILABLE? The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation ( themmrf.org ) offers a wealth of information about myeloma and con - nects patients to resources such as Myeloma Mentors, sup - port groups, a clinical trial finder and patient navigators who can give guidance by phone ( 888-841-6673 ) or email (patientnavigator@themmrf.org ). The nonprofit organi - zation also collects deidentified data from patients who volunteer to share it; the information is used in research studies such as the CureCloud ( mmrfcurecloud.org ) to advance understanding of the disease and how to treat it.

Its treatment is different from other cancers because symptom management is the major focus. WHAT IS MYELOFIBROSIS? Myelofibrosis is a rare type of blood cancer that causes the body to form excess scar tissue in bone marrow and, as a result, impairs the proper control of production of blood cells. This disease may be caused by abnormal blood stem cells in the bone marrow that produce mature cells that grow rapidly and overtake bone marrow. This leads to chronic inflammation and scar tissue formation. This also prohibits bone marrow from creating normal blood cells and moves blood cell production to the spleen or other areas in the body. In most cases, myelofibrosis is not inherited genetically. WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS? Risk factors for myelofibrosis include the following: being older than 60, although cases have been observed in younger patients. exposure to ionizing radiation and petrochemicals, such as toluene and benzene. JAK2 mutation (seen in approximately 50% to 60% of patients with myelofibrosis). CALR mutation (seen in 24% of patients with myelofi - brosis). WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS? Some patients with myelofibrosis have no symptoms, especially early on in the disease. Patients who are asymptomatic may have no symptoms for years. Patients with suspected myelofibrosis may have several symp - toms, particularly an enlarged spleen and/or abnormal blood cell counts, in addition to symptoms brought on by inflammation. Patients may feel weak or tired, and they may experience shortness of breath with mild exertion. Other symptoms include fever and night sweats; discom - fort, fullness or pain in the left upper abdominal area; bone pain; malnutrition or weight loss; itching, bruising or easy bleeding; gout or joint pain; higher rates of infec - tion; and compromised liver function. HOW IS MYELOFIBROSIS DIAGNOSED? Routine medical examinations are helpful when diag - nosing myelofibrosis. This includes a thorough clinical evaluation, patient history and several tests assessing blood counts. Although blood tests can indicate some clues pointing toward a myelofibrosis diagnosis, a biopsy to remove bone marrow tissue is needed to confirm the diagnosis. An ultrasound may be performed to see wheth - er the spleen is enlarged, which also can be an indicator. Physicians test blood cells for gene mutations such as CALR, JAK2 and MPL, which will help determine prognosis and treatment options. HOW IS MYELOFIBROSIS TREATED? Unlike other cancers, where treatment is focused on a cure, myelofibrosis is treated with symptom management. Patients who do not display many, or any, symptoms of myelofibrosis may not need to be treated immediately. Patients with intermediate-risk myelofibrosis can under - go treatment for symptoms and side effects such as anemia (androgen therapy, blood transfusions and medications to improve blood cell counts) and an enlarged spleen (surgi - cal removal or targeted drug therapy). High-risk disease should be treated aggressively, which can include a bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant. With this, a patient's diseased bone marrow is replaced with healthy blood stem cells after they undergo chemotherapy or radiation to destroy diseased bone marrow. However, there is significant risk involved. A decision to move forward with a transplant is made based on many factors discussed by patients, their families and doctors. WHERE IS HELP AVAILABLE?

As patients struggl e with issues of diagnosis and treatment, they could also face the social pressures that come from well- meaning friends who want more than anything for them to be OK. Psycho-oncologists, who address the emotional needs of patients with cancer, have determined that a healthy emotional response to a cancer diagnosis includes three phases \u2014 initial reaction, distress and adjustment \u2014 that will take patients through a typical grieving proces s. The initial reaction to a cancer diagnosis is often shock and disbelief, followed by a period of distress characterized by mixed symptoms of anxi - ety, anger and depression. As patients learn about their options and begin to see a treatment plan form, they will enter an adjustment phase. Follow - ing a diagnosis, they might experience persistent sadness, in addition to anxiety or depression; decreased interest in sexual activity; fatigue; dif - ficulty concentrating, remembering or making decisions; insomnia or oversleeping; weight and appetite loss; and restlessness or irritability. Usually, many of these symptoms might be considered unhealthy, but for a person with a new cancer diagnosis, they are a normal part of the process of dealing with a new reality. How - ever, feelings of hopelessness and guilt, or feeling stuck in one of the stages above, could indicate more serious distress. Online or in-person support groups or profes - sional counseling can help. LEARN MORE! Relaxation techniques can ease difficult emotions. Scan the QR to read more .PART 2: AT DIAGNOSIS 33 ANXIETY Patients with cancer participate more today in determining their treatment plans than in past years. But with that power comes the anxiety of making a decision, particularly when there are multiple options and no clear advantage to any one choice. The number of therapy options depends on the type of cancer. In addition, doctors might disagree about the best course of action when a standard of treatment does not exist for a certain cancer, adding another layer to a complex decision. Some people find that researching their cancer helps relieve anxiety. The internet has made it easier and faster for people to find cancer infor - mation and support online, but it can also expose people to false and misleading claims. Many hospitals and treatment facilities have libraries or patient education centers that provide reliable resources, and nonprofit organizations often have support groups that enable patients to talk with others who share their diagnosis. Often, patients cope with their situation by concentrating on the things they can control, such as taking good care of their bodies by eating a healthful diet and exercising. Some patients find relief in completing practical tasks, such as setting up a system to deal with insurance, making sure wills and other legal issues are finalized or talking with friends and loved ones about unresolved problems or feelings. A cancer diagnosis is stressful, and few people successfully manage it by themselves. Most seek encouragement from friends, family members or support groups. Others seek support from clergy, nurses or mental health professionals. Another useful resource offered by some hospi - tals is a patient navigator, typically a registered nurse, social worker or trained community member (sometimes a cancer survivor), who can help patients \"navigate\" the health care system, appointments and financial issues. In most cases, patient navigators won't tell patients what to do, but will suggest questions to ask their doctors and CHEVRIER ILLUSTRATION BY RAY PELESKODEALING WITH EMOTIONS ADVICE FROM a SURVIVOR JANE BIEHL, PH.D. \"Hope is the one emotion we can control (even) when a cancer is terminal. There is always hope for a new clinical trial, a new chemo or a new immune booster. And if one is really ill and ready to let go, hope remains for relief in the next unknown step. It is hope and the 'why' that keep us going. More than any medicine, radiation or chemo, one thing is especially important: A reason for being, for staying alive, for loving life can be miraculous. This love can be for a family member, a close friend, a pet or a cause. In my depressive moods, which hit with a vengeance, the ray of hope to get me through is usually a small but important gesture, like a phone call from a friend, a card from a family member, my dog putting her face in my lap or my cat crawling into bed with me. All these things make me feel good. Grab this gesture, seize the day and never give up hope. Try to do the same for others. If one has the why, the how will happen. Never forget that. \" help them establish priorities. Being prepared can decrease stress and anxiety. It's important to remember that each patient's cancer and situation are unique. So when it comes to support, one size does not fit all. Patients should SCAN THE QR CODE TO READ JANE'S STORY 34 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONtalk with their health care teams to learn about available resources. A cancer diagnosis also affects a patient's loved ones, so support could be needed for coping with family dynamics. Patients might feel too ill to fix a meal or might need a ride to the clinic. They might need to take time off from work, temporarily thwart - ing career aspirations and conceivably placing a greater financial burden on a spouse or partner. Whether patients have early-stage or advanced cancer, the diagnosis will likely bring up feelings of mortality, which can also cause anxiety. Addressing practical end-of-life issues, such as drawing up legal documents, can help lessen anxiety. GUIL T Upon receiving a cancer diagnosis, some patients have a sense of guilt that they did something to cause their cancer \u2014 or that their family has to also go through it. Although some cancers are linked to certain behaviors, it doesn't do any good to look back. It's not unusual for patients to try to understand why their cancer developed, but focusing on the cause can lead to unnecessary stress. A study of women who had recently received a breast cancer diagnosis showed that those who blamed themselves for their cancer had higher levels of distress than those who didn't. The findings also suggested self-blame made it harder to psychologically adjust. Guilt is a barrier to living life fully, so experts recommend that patients work through those feelings by talking to a social worker or counselor, keeping a journal or participating in a support group. DEPRESSION Studies indicate that nearly one-fourth of patients with cancer will have symptoms of depression dur - ing treatment, which is understandable. Feelings of sadness about cancer and the changes it brings are normal and could actually help patients cope. However, persistent feelings of helplessness or hopelessness and a sense of worthlessness are not typical, so patients experiencing these feelings should notify their doctors. To distinguish between normal sadness and depression, patients should note their mental state and determine if, after two weeks, they feel better emotionally. If not, the patients should be evaluated to find out if the problem is clinical depression. Remember, some cancer therapies are associated with mood disturbances. People with mild to moderate depression are often responsive to talk therapy. For these patients, support groups, buddy systems, cancer educa - tion programs and psychotherapy can be useful for regaining a sense of competence and control. For those with moderate to severe depression, medication and psychotherapy are an effective combination. A range of antidepressants is available that varies significantly in terms of side effects, toler - ability and safety, and their use should be monitored. Depression is a treatable disorder of the brain. It's an illness, so patients shouldn't be afraid to get the help they need to manage it. MANAGING DISTRESS Just as there's no single way to treat cancer, there's no one prescription for dealing with distress. Some patients benefit from speaking with a counselor or social worker, others from taking antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, exercising or meditating. For details about distress screening and manage - ment, visit CancerSupportCommunity.org. Strategies known as integrative and complementary therapies can help with both the emotional and phys - ical side effects of stress, worry and the disease and treatments themselves. These can include massage, yoga, acupuncture, meditation and therapies cen - tered on music, art, writing or dance. Many hospitals offer such services, and others led by trained experts can be found in communities. Integrative therapies may be, but are not always, part of palliative care plans, which are care strategies MONGKOLCHON / STOCK.ADOBE.COMPART 2: AT DIAGNOSIS35 that don't aim to cure disease, but are meant to improve quality of life for patients during and after treatment by relieving symptoms. Experts agree that palliative care should be available early in the cancer journey, regardless of someone's diagnosis or prognosis. In addition, there are several programs designed to boost the physical appearance of women and men with cancer \u2014 through methods including makeup and wig application, stenciling in eyebrows for those who have lost hair, and even the staging of fashion photo shoots \u2014 that can also go a long way toward lifting spirits. TELLING FAMILY MEMBERS When deciding when, what and whom to tell about their cancer, patients should gauge their feelings about their diagnosis, their need to talk to someone about what they're going through, and what tasks they anticipate needing help with. The American Cancer Society recommends creating a list of people to tell in person and others who should get the news from a friend or family member. Decide in advance how much detail to give.When telling children about a health threat that will affect the whole family, consider the family's usual way of deal - ing with sadness, as well as each child's age and preparedness for difficult situ - ations, suggests Karen Hurley, Ph.D., a psychologist at Cleveland Clinic. Giving children information in small chunks, conveyed with positivity but a note of realism, can work well, Hurley said in a talk to people with predispositions to hereditary cancers. Once the immediate family has been told, the American Cancer Society sug - gests that the patient consider the types of responses that make him or her feel angry or upset, and planning answers that will quickly put such conversations to rest. To avoid repeated discussions about treatments and health status, patients can ask a loved one to set up a page on a website such as Car - ingBridge.org and share group updates with friends and relatives. Those finding it difficult to discuss their feelings with loved ones may benefit from joining an in- person or online support group or consulting with clergy, nurses, mental health professionals and/or patient navigators. THE NEGATIVE OF POSITIVE THINKING As patients begin to tell others about their diagnosis, they could feel pressured to maintain a positive attitude, which can be difficult when they are scared, anxious or not feeling well. False optimism is not only unrealistic, but an unnecessary burden. There is no solid evidence that emotional outlook affects survival, yet people unaf - fected by cancer often expect and encourage those with the disease to stay positive despite how they are really feeling. People's reactions to cancer differ greatly. Patients should remember that it's their experience and there is no need to feel they have to please others by the way they cope with it. DEALING WITH EMOTIONS MONGKOLCHON / STOCK.ADOBE.COM Managing distress from a cancer diagnosis can come in many informs including speaking with a counselor, yoga and integrative therapies. 36 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONEConsidering Age-Related Issues Regardless of when patients receive their diagnosis, their age affects the next step EVERY PATIENT faces unique issues during and after treatment. In the past, oncologists focused primarily on treating the cancer, overlooking some issues related to the patient's age. But now, doctors are increasingly concerned about the effect of treatment on a person's future, including treatment-related long-term effects. YOUNGER PATIENTS AND FERTILITY Younger patients often have to contend with challenges related to coping skills, social con - cerns, behavioral issues, employment matters and treatment-related infertility. Doctors should broach all of these issues, taking particular care to mention fertility preservation options to all fertile patients \u2014 male or female \u2014 or, in the case of children, to their parents or guardians.A single cancer treatment can affect fertility, so it is essential that patients and their doctors develop fertility preservation plans before treat - ment starts. This might mean delaying treatment to accommodate fertility preservation methods, such as banking sperm or freezing eggs. For example, prostate and testicular cancer therapies can affect sperm production, result - ing in low sperm count or infertility. Banking sperm is a proven technique for men wanting to preserve fertility. If sperm count is low, a process called intracytoplasmic sperm injection requires only one sperm to fertilize an egg. Another tech - nique is testicular sperm aspiration, in which sperm is taken directly from the testicle or from resected testicular tissue. It is used in men with low sperm count. LEARN MORE!

PART 2: AT DIAGNOSIS 37 CONSIDERING AGE-RELATED ISSUESWINDYNIGHT / STOCK.ADOBE.COM CANCER IN CHILDREN Kids and Adults: What's the Difference? THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHILDHOOD AND ADUL T CANCERS rarely comes down to simply age. Most tumors in children differ biologically from those in their adult coun - terparts, typically due to the cell type from which the cancer originates. In the weeks after fertilization, the embryo develops into layers: ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. These layers are the founda - tion for the development and maturation of tissues and organs in the body. Adult cancers, such as lung, breast and colo - rectal, typically develop from epithelial tissue (adenocarcinomas), which come from the ectoderm or endoderm. Epithelial cells make up the skin and lining of the internal organs and glands. Alternatively, childhood cancers, including sarcomas (cancers of the bone or muscle) and leukemias (blood cancers), most often develop from the mesoderm. Like adult cancers, many childhood cancers form from genetic changes in cells. Only a small number of childhood cancers are caused by a genetic change inherited from a parent. It isn't clear what causes the rest, but unlike can - cers in adults, cases in children don't typically result from lifestyle factors, such as smoking or sun overexposure. It's important for parents and children to know that there's nothing they could have done to prevent the cancer. Researchers have proposed that biological differences could point to why childhood can - cers are often more responsive to chemother - apy, which is designed to target rapidly divid - ing cells. Epithelial cells are normally resilient because they are exposed to environmental influences, making them more resistant to treatment if they become cancerous. Vulner - able childhood cancer cells, however, are ideal targets for chemotherapy. Indeed, childhood cancer survivors are less likely to experience recurrence than adults, and the five-year sur - vival rate across all childhood cancers for the years 2008-2014, 83%, is higher than that for adult cancers, 69%. Childhood cancer is rare, with 11,060 new cases having been expected during 2019, according to American Cancer Society data. Although the incidence of these cancers has risen by 0.6% per year since 1975, the death rate for cancer in children ages 0 to 14 declined by two-thirds from 1970 to 2016, mainly be - cause of better treatments and more participa - tion in clinical trials.38 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONFor women, certain chemotherapy drugs and hormone treatments, as well as radiation to the pelvic area, can damage the ovaries and other reproductive organs or cause early menopause. Because women are born with a limited num - ber of eggs, or oocytes, damaging them during cancer treatment can leave a woman infertile. If treatment calls for radiation to the pelvis, the doctor may be able to preserve the ova - ries by doing a procedure that moves them away from the radiation field. Treatments that temporarily shut down ovarian function dur - ing chemotherapy are also being studied as a means to prevent damage to eggs. Another option may be in vitro fertiliza - tion (IVF), in which an egg is fertilized in the lab and frozen, or cryopreserved, and later thawed and inserted into the uterus. Egg retrieval must be done before treatment and could require several weeks to obtain viable eggs. Hormone injections might be given to promote egg development, but natural meth - ods are also available. IVF can be performed with donor sperm and embryos. While freezing unfertilized eggs is possible, the success rate is lower than it is for freezing embryos. Once thawed, the egg is fertilized by intracytoplasmic sperm injection and inserted into the uterus, and better freezing and fertili - zation techniques are improving success rates. Researchers are also exploring ways to freeze testicular and ovarian tissue to be transplanted back into the patient after therapy. Insurance coverage of fertility care varies, and the cost can be high. Depending on a patient's plan, some treatments might be pro - vided, especially if they are part of a necessary medical procedure being performed anyway. Recently, laws requiring health insurers to cover fertility preservation for patients with CANCER IN ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADUL TS Special Centers May Help Teens, Young Adults TEENAGERS AND YOUNGER ADUL TS MAY BENEFIT from care in hospital sections dedicated specifically to adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients.

OLDER PATIENTS AND HEAL TH CHALLENGES Cancer is primarily a disease of aging. For many common cancers, the development of a tumor takes considerable time, dependent on a series of often unrelated events at the cellular level. Over the course of years, genetic changes and environmen - tal toxins, such as tobacco, can cause DNA-damaging effects on cells. Mean - while, the body's ability to repair damaged cells appears to decline with advancing age. At the same time, the aging tissue around those damaged cells appears to play a role, creating a more conducive environment in which malignancies can grow. As cells age and stop dividing, it's speculated that they develop a micro - environment that fosters cancer's development. Another potential contrib - utory factor, researchers say, is the declining immu - nity that naturally occurs with advancing age.To complicate matters, many older people who receive a cancer diagnosis already suffer from at least one other illness, or comorbidity, such as heart disease, diabetes, hyperten - sion or arthritis \u2014 some of which could be life-threatening.NEW AFRICA / STOCK.ADOBE.COM Patients with cancer receiving treatment for depression must be aware that some antidepressants can decrease the effectiveness of cancer drugs. Surgery might not be an option for patients who have lung cancer and emphysema, because impaired lung function can cause complications. Hormonal therapies can increase the rate of bone loss, so patients with osteoporosis could be at increased risk for fractures and additional loss of bone mass.Patients who have cancer and heart problems might not be able to receive anthracyclines or some targeted agents because of the risk of heart damage. Certain drugs can cause nerve damage, so patients with diabetes, a disease that can also cause nerve damage, are at greater risk for neuropathy. CANCER AND OTHER ILLNESSES PATIENTS WITH CANCER OFTEN HAVE OTHER ILLNESSES that can have an impact on treatment decision-making, some of which are considered here.ILLUSTRATION BY ERIN MOORECONSIDERING AGE-RELATED ISSUES40 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONComorbid illness affects all aspects of cancer care, from early diagnosis to treatment options and prognosis. In fact, as patients with cancer are living longer, comorbid illnesses have a greater effect on long-term health. Patients with pre- existing illnesses may be less likely to survive their cancers and may face a greater risk of recurrence. To get appropriate and effective cancer treatment, patients should be evaluated, not only in terms of the physical effects of the cancer, but also for any other health issues they might have. Cancer drugs often have side effects that aggravate other medical conditions, and drug contraindications can create additional problems. For example, one proteasome inhibitor treats multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, but can cause pain and numbness in the hands and feet \u2014 known as neuropathy \u2014 that could be worse in people with diabetes, who are prone to nerve damage. Hormone therapy blocks the production of male or female hormones. For instance, aro - matase inhibitors for breast cancer block estrogen production. Because estrogen helps maintain healthy bones, blocking it can increase the risk for osteoporosis or cause problems if a patient already has osteoporosis. Other cancer drugs, including monoclonal antibodies for HER2-positive breast cancer and anthracyclines for leukemia and some solid tumors, could worsen heart conditions, which are more common among older people. These drugs can injure the heart muscle, so patients must be monitored closely, and the dose of the drug might be limited based on heart function. Side effects do not always mean that certain cancer drugs cannot be given if patients have another illness. Instead, doctors might adjust the dosage of medication \u2014 both for the cancer and other illnesses \u2014 so that patients can receive the most effective cancer therapy. Older patients with cancer should not auto - matically receive less aggressive therapy than younger patients. Age no longer matters as much as general fitness when it comes to eligibility for cancer treatment. Despite the prevalence of other common illnesses and the perception that older people are less likely to benefit from and cope with the stress of treatment, they typically fare equally well in overall survival and quality of life as their younger counterparts.

Some groups experience a higher relative incidence of cancer and a greater chance of disease complications or death. Also, patients who face barriers to health care may miss out on the chance to be screened for cancer so that the disease can be discovered in its earliest and most treatable stages. So, it's helpful for members of these under - served groups to be aware of any obstacles and, if faced with them, speak up or seek support. Geography: It can be difficult to obtain consis tent, expert health care for people who live in rural areas, which often face a shortage of oncologists and are far from top cancer hospitals. These patients should know that they may be able to have an oncologist at a large cancer center direct their care largely from afar with the help of telemedicine, so that they can receive most of their treatments at local facilities. Socioeconomic status: Statistically, patients with lower education and income levels experi - ence worse health outcomes after cancer than do their counterparts who've had more years of schooling, bring in higher salaries and have some form of health insurance. People affected by pov - erty also may have higher rates of smoking, lower rates of exercise and breastfeeding, more obesity and drinking and a greater risk of exposure to dangerous pollutants in their neighborhoods, all of which are risk factors for cancer.

PART 2: AT DIAGNOSIS 43 to get annual well visits, report any unusual symptoms and get all the cancer screenings for which they are eligible. Those in this group who do have cancer can ask for help from a patient navigator or social worker at their care facility if they are having trouble making, keeping, afford - ing or getting to appointments or sticking with the treatments prescribed to them. Patient advocacy groups may also be able to offer help; check our list of resources at curetoday.com/journey . Insurance status: Not surprisingly, health opportunities and outcomes tend to be worse for those who are uninsured or underinsured. People in this group can check the national health care marketplace website, healthcare.gov, to see if they qualify for insurance that is subsidized by the gov - ernment or free through Medicaid. In addition, some patient advocacy groups may offer financial help or other support programs to individual patients and pharmaceutical companies may offer discounted or free medications. Ethnic or racial background: Ethnic and racial minorities who have cancer don't always benefit from full access to care or participate in clinical trials at the same rates White patients do. This can mean that trial results don't fully represent the usefulness of drugs in those populations. Socioeconomic factors can be one reason for the lack of participation, but another could involve a cultural reluctance to pursue treatment. For instance, distrust of the health system among Black patients dates, in part, to the 1932-1972 study of untreated syphilis in Black men, conducted by the U.S. Public Health Service and the Tuskegee Institute. Participating men were not given the opportunity to provide informed consent or given adequate treatment to cure their illness, even when penicillin became the standard of care in 1947, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). One resource working to alleviate this concern is BlackDoctor.com, which helps readers find doctors who are likely to be cul - turally sensitive. Language and cultural barriers may also stand in the way of care. For instance, Spanish-speaking Hispanics are less likely to be screened for colorectal cancer than Whites or English-speaking Hispanics. Furthermore, in some instances, members of specific ethnic or racial groups have worse health outcomes because of genetic predispositions for aggressive or hard-to-treat cancers. Triple- negative breast cancer, which disproportionately affects Black women, is an example of this. In addition, some skin cancers that are difficult to treat affect Black patients disproportionately, and Black patients are twice as likely as White patients to get multiple myeloma. American Indians/ Alaska Natives, meanwhile, are the most likely to get liver cancer and cervical cancer and to die from kidney cancer. Patients who are in these groups or have family histories of cancer can speak with their doctors about increased screening or other preventive measures. They can also call their state health departments to ask about any free cancer- screening programs available for underserved populations. The CDC offers one that provides breast cancer screening, which can be found at cdc.gov/cancer/nbccedp/screenings.htm. Gender or sexual identity: Members of the LGBTQ+ community, which includes people who are lesbian and gay, also face barriers to good, consist - ent health care. LGBTQ+ people face a higher risk of cancer and a lower likelihood of having health insur - ance. Furthermore, they may face discrimination and isolation, which could lead to a higher likelihood of smoking and drinking, behaviors that raise the risk of cancer. Finally, discrimination from health care providers, or the fear of it, may lead patients to delay or avoid medical care. Some patient advocacy groups that may be able to help are the National LGBT Cancer Network (cancer-network.org ) and Cancer Care (cancercare.org/questions/242 ), which offers sup - port groups and other resources. Overall, patients who are aware of these dispari - ties and willing to serve as their own advocates are the most likely to contribute to the protection of their health and obtain appropriate cancer care. OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO CARE44 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONMBalancing Cancer & Work Choosing to stay in the workforce through treatment requires planning ahead MANY PATIENTS WORRY ABOUT JOB SECURITY and maintaining their health insurance coverage, and push themselves to work through cancer- related pain and fatigue. Yet balancing cancer treatment and work is possible with a proactive plan, accommodating employers and medical advances that include less toxic treatments and medication to alleviate side effects. Almost half of all patients with cancer receive their diag - nosis before age 65; up to 60% will continue to work during treatment. Of those who stop working during treatment, up to 80% might return to the workforce at some point. HOW TO MAKE IT WORK Cancer stereotypes have changed dramatically, but patients, as well as employers, might still make assumptions about how a diagnosis will or will not affect work. Experts recommend having a plan in place before discussing a cancer diag - nosis at work. Patients should: 4 Enter into the conversation with super - visors and coworkers with as much knowledge as possible and not be afraid to suggest what would work best for them during treatment. 4 Develop a communication strategy with supervisors and coworkers that includes goals, a treatment schedule, possible side effects, delegation of or change in job duties, whether to tell anyone about the diagnosis and whom to tell about any medi - cally related limitations.

Be upfront about what can and cannot be expected. 4 Ask to decrease the workload, work from home or take time off from the job because of treatment schedules or side effects, such as fatigue or nau - sea. Scheduling chemotherapy late in the week can provide a weekend to recover. KNOW THE LAW The rate of job discrimination against patients with cancer and survivors has decreased, partly because of protections from the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other antidiscrimina - tion laws that keep survivors from being treated unfairly in the workplace. Discrimination that does occur is often a result of misconceptions regarding cancer and a patient's ability to work. Experts recommend that patients experiencing discrimination take legal action only as a last resort. Instead, they should familiarize themselves with their company's policies and talk with the human resources department about their issues and possible solutions. Often, information from social workers or the medical team and support from coworkers can resolve a situation. If legal action is the only alternative, patients should keep written records of all actions and communications. Although patients have the right to keep their diagnosis confidential, it is recommended they disclose their cancer history to their employer in case it affects their job performance and they want accommodations under the ADA. Patients who work for companies with at least 15 employees must be reasonably accommodated, which can include a change in job duties or flex time.KITE_RIN / ADOBE STOCKJEFF BARES , RETURN-TO-WORK CASE MANAGER, ALLSUP EMPLOYMENT SERVICES \"Returning to work after an absence is always a scary time frame. Before returning, it's very important to keep in contact with the employer and express the intent to return; give them updates along the way. If you are going to need any accommodations from the employer (such as a modified work schedule, telecommuting or reduced amounts of heavy lifting), it should be in writing from a physician and provided to the employer's human resources department. Don't divulge too much information (about your illness or accommodations) to your coworkers, because that could cause animosity. Be smart about what you share. \"BALANCING CANCER & WORK The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) also protects jobs at companies with 50 or more employees for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave and guarantees the continuation of benefits.

Among the work-related questions of people who have cancer: Can I keep working? Will I lose my paycheck or my health insurance? Could I get fired if I take time off to have treat - ment or because I don't feel well? Can my work tasks, hours or environment be modified? Fortunately, both state and federal laws protect the rights of working people with can - cer, but it's important to understand which laws might apply to an individual's situation, says Rebecca Nellis, executive director of Cancer and Careers, a New York City-based national nonprofit organization that helps people navigate the intersection of work and cancer. \"The law is a tool that can make things easier,\" she says, \"but understanding your rights and dealing with them at work are two very different things. You need to know what you have access to and how to make it work for you in your job at your company.\" Lack of a specific legal protection, how - ever, doesn't mean a person who has cancer can't work. \" All hope isn't lost if the law isn't a tool for you,\" Nellis says. Some patients find protection and help via company policies and supportive supervisors. Each workplace has its own culture, and it's critical to under - stand what that entails, she says. \"Someone's work experience and their response to it is as unique as their cancer treatment plan and response to it,\" Nellis says.Knowledge Is Power Understanding federal and state laws can protect workers who have cancer LEARN MORE!

By Dara ChadwickPART 2: AT DIAGNOSIS 47 FEDERAL LAWS TO PROTECT If someone is concerned about the effect of a can - cer diagnosis on their job or health insurance, they should learn how federal and state laws may protect them. Generally, three major federal laws offer pro - tection to workers: the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and the Affordable Care Act. Generally, the ADA protects someone who works for a private employer with 15 or more employ - ees or for a state or local government, labor organization or employment agency. (In federal agencies, employees are typically covered by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.) To be protected by the ADA, an employee must be considered a \"qualified individual\" \u2014 someone who can perform the job's essential functions, with or without reasonable accommodations, and has a disability. According to the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, a disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a \"major life activity,\" such as the ability to walk, breathe, concentrate or sleep. Individuals with disabilities also include those who have a history of a substantially lim - iting impairment. According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, people who have cancer or are in remission typically are protected by the ADA. In addition to making discrimination in employ - ment practices unlawful, protections under the ADA include \"reasonable accommodations,\" such as changes to workspaces or schedules, using tech - nology to assist with job duties, more frequent breaks and telecommuting. The FMLA allows eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of job-protected unpaid leave each year, with continuation of group health insurance cover - age, for their own serious medical condition or to care for a child, parent or spouse with a serious con - dition. Generally, this applies to private employers with 50 or more employees, along with certain public agencies and employers, regardless of number of employees. To learn more, visit dol.gov/whd/fmla. WASEEM ALI KHAN / ADOBE STOCKWHERE CAREGIVERS STAND Caregiver Rights WHEN A LOVED ONE receives a diagnosis of cancer, many people want to take time off work to assist with transportation to treatment and post-treat - ment care. Unfortunately, caregivers don't have access to the same legal protections as patients. Caregivers are not entitled to accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, accord - ing to Monica Bryant, a cancer rights attorney and chief operating officer for Triage Cancer, a national nonprofit organization. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides up to 12 weeks of job-protected unpaid leave, with continued group health insurance coverage, to care for a seriously ill family member, but its definition of family includes just a child, parent or spouse. \"FMLA does not include grandmothers, moth - ers-in-law, siblings or grandchildren, \" Bryant says. Some states, including California, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island, have paid family leave laws, which may offer some protection to employees caring for an ill fam - ily member. People should check with their state's Department of Labor to learn more about state laws that may protect them. They can also turn to a Triage Cancer resource to help patients sort through these issues, which is available at triagecancer. org/quickguide-caregiving . Triage Cancer also offers other caregiving resources, which can be found at triagecancer.org/caregiving . Although legal protections are fewer for caregivers, Bryant encourages people to talk with their employ - ers. \"These requests often fall under the 'it can't hurt to ask' umbrella, \" she says. \"Employers want to keep valuable employees. \" She also encourages caregivers to advocate for legal changes. \"We have the existing rights we have because of advocates who came before us, \" Bryant says, adding that there's always room for improve - ment. \"We encourage advocacy because no law is perfect. Let's get some more rights for caregivers. \"KNOWLEDGE IS POWER48 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONAnd to learn about how this law might protect employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, visit triagecancer.org/eligible-paid-fmla-leave . Additional information about returning to work or taking time off due to the COVID-19 pandemic can be found at https://tinyurl.com/y5qwf2cc , and a host of relevant articles are archived at triagecancer. org/category/covid-19 and at cancerfinances.org in the COVID-19 module. The Affordable Care Act gave consumers of health care new rights and benefits, offering additional health insurance options for people with employer- sponsored insurance if they need to leave a job, according to Monica Bryant, chief operating officer for Triage Cancer, a national nonprofit organization that provides education on the practical and legal issues of people with cancer. The law also helps people qualify for a special enrollment period to buy insurance on an exchange, go back on their parents' insurance plan if they're under age 26 or potentially qualify for Medicaid. To learn more, visit healthcare.gov. Another federal law of note is the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, which prohibits employers with at least 15 employees from using genetic information to make deci - sions about hiring, promotions, compensation, termination and other employment matters. The law helps protect employees from discrimina - tion based on genetic testing \u2014 for example, if an employer with a self-funded insurance plan inadvertently gains access to medical informa - tion through claims data. \"Your company might know if you've had a BRCA test,\" Bryant says. \"Ultimately, they're not supposed to make deci - sions based on that knowledge.\" Other federal laws that help people keep and use their group health insurance include the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which offers appeals protections to people who've been denied coverage, and the COBRA health insurance law. Officially called the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, it helps peo -ple maintain their health insurance after they've left a job or reduced their working hours. STATE LAWS AND EMPLOYER POLICIES Although federal laws provide protections to employees who qualify, it's important to understand applicable state laws, too. \"I cannot stress the impor - tance of state laws enough,\" Bryant says. \"The prob - lem is that so many times, people don't know what they don't know.\" Comprehensive online resources like Triage Cancer provide a good starting point by listing state resources. A person can also contact their state's Department of Labor or Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Another important source of protection might be found in a company's employee manual. \"Know your employer's policies and follow their processes,\" Bryant says. \"If other employees are already telecom - muting, it's easier to get that as an accommodation. Laws are the bare minimum of what an employer has to provide.\" Nellis suggests pulling together all information about possible aid, including benefits and compa - ny policies. \"Think about your own work environ - ment and come up with a strategy,\" she says. \"If you want to stay at work, think strategically about how to make it work. It's easier to do when you're protected by state or federal law, but the law is just one way.\" WORKPLACE RIGHTS One of the biggest concerns for people with cancer is disclosure \u2014 how much they need to tell their employer. The short answer? Less than a person might think. \"Disclosure doesn't mean every detail of what you're going through,\" Nellis says. \"Disclosure isn't all or nothing. It's a spectrum.\" Approaches regarding disclosure are as individual as workers themselves. \"Some folks want to keep things private and schedule all their treatments in the early morning or evening,\" says Shelley Fuld Nasso, chief executive officer for the National PART 2: AT DIAGNOSIS49 Coalition of Cancer Survivorship in Silver Spring, Maryland. \"Some survivors want to continue work - ing for the sense of normalcy, while others don't have a choice.\" Those who want to keep information about their illness private are entitled to do so; however, they may have to disclose some information to access reasonable accommodations or rights under the FMLA, Bryant says. Pay attention to medical certification forms, she advises. An employer is entitled to have a health care provider certify a medical condition before providing a reasonable accommodation, but Bryant encourages people with cancer to have a conversation with their doctor about what will be disclosed. \"For example, a health care provider can certify that an employee has severe nausea or fatigue,\" she says. \"The certification doesn't have to mention chemotherapy.\"If someone decides to disclose their illness, Nellis suggests framing the situation as fluid. \"Be clear that this is what you know right now, but things can change,\" she says. \"Set up an open line of communication.\" BE PROACTIVE For people who worry about how treatment might affect their ability to do their job, Nellis suggests a proactive approach, such as keeping a work diary. \"You might keep a record of the date you decided to disclose and who you disclosed to,\" she says. \"You might acknowledge that you had a challenge at work that involved slipping up on a project.\" She also suggests recording details about projects, keeping emails and voicemails as reminders regard - ing work in progress, and scheduling blocks of time for focused work. \"Done together, these things might create a safety net,\" she says. \"Remember the employer's lens. Set expectations by saying 'I recognize that we need to get X, Y and Z done. Here's how I think this could happen.'\" Both Nellis and Bryant advise people with can - cer to consider their employment future when deciding how much to disclose on the job. \"We have people say, 'My employer is so great,'\" Bryant says. \"But you may not have that job or supervisor forever. Disclosure is a bell you can't unring. You have the legal right to access benefits without disclosing.\" And if someone feels they have been treated dif - ferently or discriminated against because of their cancer? The response depends on a person's goals, Bryant says. \"If all you want is to be the best employ - ee you can be, you might have a conversation with your supervisor,\" she says. \"Other people no longer want to work for that employer and want to teach them a lesson.\" Still, she encourages people to pause before tak - ing legal action: \"We don't want people to jump to filing a lawsuit if there are things in between they can do.\" KNOWLEDGE IS POWER PROTECTING YOUR RIGHTS Get Connected DO YOU NEED MORE information about protecting your rights in the workplace?

The doctor must know how much can - cer is in the patient's body, where it is located, whether it has spread, and the specific type of cells that make up the tumor and how aggres - sive they are. THE PATHOLOGIST In addition to conducting laboratory tests to diagnose diseases in general, pathologists also conduct specific tests on the cancer to deter - mine a number of factors, including the type of cancer cells, the grade of the cancer, the size of the tumor, the extent the cancer has invaded the surrounding tissue and whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes and other locations in the body. This information, compiled in a pathology report (see box, page 51), provides patients and their medical teams with essential information to help them determine the best treatment. The pathologist first looks at the tissue with the naked eye in a \"gross examina - tion.\" Its appearance and characteristics, such as size, weight, color and texture, are recorded. If an entire tumor or lesion has been removed, it is microscopically measured from the edge of the malignancy to the edge of the removed tissue, which should include healthy tissue. If cancer cells are found at the edge, that is considered a positive margin, suggest - ing that more cancer cells could remain in the Understanding Pathology & Staging The extent of cancer, what it looks like and where it is will guide diagnosis and treatment LEARN MORE!

This means that more surgery or other treatments might be needed to try to remove or kill any remaining cancer cells. A negative or clean margin means there are no cancer cells found at the edge of the removed tissue. Once removed, the specimen is cut into thin slices by the pathologist for further test - ing. The pathologist examines the tissue under a microscope, but other techniques are some - times used to identify factors involved in the abnor - mal growth of cells, including fluorescence in situ hybridiza - tion (FISH) and immunohis - tochemistry (IHC) or other molecular tests to identify mutated genes that might help to drive the can - cer. Many tumor characteristics identified by these tests can be important in choosing the right treatment. As the technol - ogy to examine cells has become more advanced, pathology offers more exten - sive information about which treatments will be most effective. Patients should ask their doctors about the cancer's pathology to learn as much as possible about why a certain treatment is recommended and how it will work against the cancer. FISH uses fluorescent molecules to \"paint\" genes, allowing the pathologist to determine genetic mutations or how many copies of a particular gene are present in each cell. IHC is a staining test that helps detect and classify cancer cells.UNDERSTANDING PATHOLOGY & STAGING IMPORTANT INFORMATION Translating a Pathology Report BY LAW, PATIENTS ARE ENTITLED to a copy of their pathology report, and most hospitals will provide a copy free of charge. It's important to keep a record of the pathology report to have documentation of the diagnosis; this informa - tion will be helpful in researching the disease. Below is a brief explanation of information found in a pathology report. Demographics: Information about the patient, such as the patient's name, age, sex and date of procedure. Specimen: The origin of the tissue sample. Clinical history: The patient's medical history, including how the cancer was found. Clinical diagnosis: The diagnosis doctors were expecting before the patient's tissue was tested. Procedure: How the tissue sample was removed. Gross description: Details of the tissue sample, including its size, weight and color. Microscopic description: How the cancer cells look under a microscope, including tumor char - acteristics, such as grade, tumor margins, lymph node involvement and pathologic stage. Special tests or markers: Results of tests that look for proteins, genes and how quickly the cells are growing. These findings are often contained in a separate report. Summary: A pathologic diagnosis based on the information from the entire pathology report.52 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITION If the patient's cancer is very rare or if the doctor thinks the pathologist's diagnosis is inconsistent with the patient's symptoms and other test results, a second opinion might be appropriate. GRADING SYSTEMS The pathologist provides a number of evaluative elements that can help patients understand their tumors. A tumor's grade describes how abnormal the cancer cells appear under the microscope. Factors that go into deciding the grade vary, but usually include the size and shape of the cell's nucleus, the proportion of cancer cells that are dividing and the patterns the cells form as they join. If many cells are dividing, it can be a sign that the cancer is aggressive. Cancer cells that look more like normal cells usually grow and multiply slowly and are described as being low grade, well differ - entiated or grade 1. Conversely, cancers that do not resemble normal tissues are called high grade, poorly differentiated or grade 3 or 4. The attributes are combined into an overall tumor grade that ranges from 1 to 4 depending on the cancer type. Grading systems vary depending on if the cancer is a solid or liquid tumor (see page 53) , and what type of cancer has been identified. For example, the grading system for prostate cancer ranges from 2 to 10. Patients should *Sizes the THE PATHOLOGIST IS ONLY one member of a patient's care team; cancer treatment and care involve many people with a variety of knowledge and skills. The makeup of the team will be determined by which specialties are best for treating the patient's type of cancer. Patients should remember that they are at the center of their team, and they have the final voice in making decisions about what happens to them. Patients might encounter these professionals: 4 Medical and radiation oncologists, radiolo - gists, pathologists and surgeons; 4 Oncology nurses, advanced practice nurses, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists and physician assistants; and 4 Social workers, oncology clinical pharmacists, dietitians, occupational and physical thera - pists, clergy, psychologists and psychiatrists. Each doctor is supported by a specialized team that plays a major role in the patient's care. Patients should try to understand the role of each person on the team (or teams), so that they can take full advantage of the skills and personal attention available to them. HOW BIG IS THE TUMOR?PART 2: AT DIAGNOSIS53 ask their doctors what factors go into grading the tumor and the scale used. Regardless of the system used, lower num - bers signify less aggressive cancers, and higher numbers more rapid growth. Tumor grade is an important indicator of prognosis in some cancers, such as brain, breast and prostate, as well as lymphoma and soft-tissue sarcoma. STAGING SYSTEMS Many cancers are also staged from 0 to 4, with 4 usually indicating that the cancer is metastatic. Solid and liquid tumors are staged differently, and the staging of certain cancer types may dif - fer. So, patients should try to understand how their cancer is staged and how important this information is for their cancer type. Staging for most cancers is based on the following: 4 Location and size of the primary tumor. 4 The number of tumors and whether the can - cer has spread to nearby organs and tissues, including the lymph nodes. 4 Whether the cancer has spread (metasta - sized) to distant organs or tissues. For some cancers, such as bone and soft- tissue sarcomas, the grade is considered when the cancer is staged. In addition to what is contained in the pathology report, data used for staging are gathered from physical exami - nations and imaging tests, such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, positive emission tomography (PET) and bone scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. TNM staging uses three characteristics of the cancer. The T refers to the primary tumor (the place where the cancer began); the N refers to the level, if any, of lymph node involvement; and the M refers to the presence or absence of metastasis. The meaning of these letters and numbers might vary for different types of cancer; some cancers might not have N3 as a category, and in other cancers, the classifications might have subcategories, such as T3a or T3b. Patients should ask their doctors about the staging system for their cancer. Once these factors are known, an overall number is assigned. Patients who are treated and then experience a recurrence might have their cancer restaged. A restaged cancer often is indicated by inclusion of the letter \"R.\" Newer chromosome tests and the analysis of multiple genes at a time (known as gene pro - filing) could subclassify the cancer and help determine prognosis and individual treatment. That's why the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system integrates grade and biomarker/molecular data, as well as anatomical indices. Besides stage and grade, the patient's cancer type, treatment and health influence prognosis. But understanding what is the cancer's stage and grade mean can help patients and their care teams choose the best course of action.

While settling back into life in San Francisco, Teresa developed a persistent cough. She thought perhaps her time in France had made her more susceptible to the California allergens. Through visits with her general practitioner, Teresa was initially treated for allergies and then later acid reflux disease - but her symptoms persisted, and she knew something still wasn't right. Teresa continued to cough constantly, and she was coughing up yolk- sized and -colored spots and blood. A concerned friend urged her to see a new doctor to get to the bottom of her symptoms. \"I had noticed I was rapidly losing weight and had a sudden aversion to food, which was unusual for me,\" Teresa recalls. \"After an X-ray revealed a large mass in my right lung, I had further testing that confirmed I had stage 4 metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, due to the size of the tumor (15 centimeters) and having spread to the lymph nodes, as well as a few nodules in the pleura.\" As she began consulting with oncologists, Teresa learned that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer.

If tests of tumor tissue at biopsy or before surgery show this is the case, patients may be able to take drugs that specifically target these glitches, rather than chemotherapies that affect their whole bodies. For some, targeted drugs or immunotherapies can be more effective and cause fewer side effects than chemotherapy, or sometimes they are given with chemotherapy. Targeted drugs work by disabling the activity of genes, proteins or tissue environment that con -tributes to cancer. Immunotherapy boosts the body's natural defenses against cancer. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved targeted drugs for the treat - ment of a variety of cancers, including lung, which can be driven by EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements or the very rare ROS1 muta - tions; melanoma, which can arise from BRAF breast, which can overexpress the protein HER2; and colorectal, which can feed off the overexpressed proteins EGFR or VEGF . Targeted drugs known as PARP inhibitors have been approved by the FDA in advanced or pre - viously treated breast, ovarian, prostate and pancreatic cancers driven by mutations to the BRCA or other genes.

In addition, immunotherapies known as checkpoint inhibitors work against a growing number of cancers, including lung, melanoma, head and neck, bladder, liver, stomach, cervical, Hodgkin lymphoma, squa - mous cell carcinoma of the skin and some kidney and breast cancers, mainly by targeting the proteins PD-1 or PD-L1. Two of these drugs are approved to treat several advanced cancers that have abnormalities in their ability to repair damage to their own DNA, including certain colorectal and endometrial cancers. Scientists are finding that cancers that originate in different parts of the body may share the same mutations. That means that, even if there is no tar - geted treatment approved for a particular cancer, there may be one on the market, or in clinical trials, that could work for a patient based on the mutations their disease expresses. Furthermore, new treatable mutations may emerge as a cancer progresses, or in response to therapy. Therefore, it's important that patients diagnosed with cancer or a recurrence ask their doctors to test them for any mutations that are known to be targe - table with drugs. TREATING GENETIC MUTATIONS, NOT CANCER TYPES Although most treatment is based on where the disease developed in the body, such as the breast, colon, prostate or liver, a growing trend focuses on treating a cancer based on the genetic mutations that drive it. The FDA has approved a number of drugs to treat several cancer types that develop due to the same mutations. A few examples: Herceptin (trastuzum - ab), which treats cancer that expresses too much of the protein HER2, can be used for both breast and stomach cancers. Avastin (bevacizumab), which slows the growth of blood vessels needed to sup - port a tumor, is approved to treat colorectal, lung, kidney, cervical and ovarian cancers, as well as the brain cancer glioblastoma. A combination of Tafinlar (dabrafenib) and Mekinist (trametinib), which stop the proteins MEK and BRAF from stimulating out-of- control cell growth, can treat melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer. Recently, the FDA approved some immunothera - pies for broader use. Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and Opdivo (nivolumab) can treat any cancer with microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair- deficient status. These tumors have trouble repairing their own damaged DNA. The immunotherapies can treat any cancers that have this status, regardless of where they started in the body, marking the first FDA approvals of drugs to be given based on a cancer's genetic mutations, rather than its type. Another first occurred when the FDA approved a different drug for use across cancer types. Vitrakvi (larotrectinib) stops abnormal proteins that are gen - erated by an NTRK gene alteration that stimulates cancer cells to grow. The agent is approved to treat any advanced solid tumor with the NTRK altera - tion. Also approved to treat that gene alteration is Rozlytrek (entrectinib). Some clinical trials follow a similar principle when testing new cancer treatments. Basket trials enroll patients with any cancer type, as long as it is driven by a specific genetic mutation, and give them a medica - tion that targets the problem. Alternatively, umbrella trials enroll patients with the same underlying origin of cancer, such as breast or pancreatic, but gives them different targeted therapies based on the mutations that make their cancers grow. In Lung-MAP ( lung- map.org ), for example, patients with lung cancer are receiving different medications based on the muta - tions driving their disease, and NCI-MATCH (https:// tinyurl.com/ydcrxbdv ) is enrolling patients with vari - ous types of solid tumors and lymphomas and treating them based on the mutations their cancers express. UNDERSTANDING THE GENETICS OF CANCER58 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONMIdentifying Inherited Genetic Risk Patients should consider genetic testing when cancer runs in the family MANY CANCERS BEGIN as a fluke mutation in a single cell. Yet in up to 10% of cancer cases, one or more mutations wind their way through family trees with a chance of affecting each new member. When mutations are deemed heredi - tary, also known as \"germline,\" they are present in every cell, including egg and sperm, and can thus be passed on to subsequent generations. Each person has 46 chromosomes \u2014 23 from each parent \u2014 that contain 20,000 to 25,000 genes. These chromosome pairs allow for a backup, so a mutated gene's healthy coun - terpart can code for the correct protein. For a hereditary cancer to develop, both copies of the gene must be affected, although it is also pos - sible to develop such a cancer if one mutated gene is inherited and its backup develops a mutation later in life. Inheriting a mutation doesn't mean it's certain that someone will develop cancer, but it does put that person at risk. Researchers have identified many inherited mutations that account for more than 50 hereditary cancer syndromes. For instance, the lifetime risk of devel - oping breast cancer or ovarian cancer is significantly increased for a woman if she inherits a BRCA mutation. In addition to breast cancer and ovarian cancer in women, BRCA mutations are associated \u2014 to a lesser degree \u2014 with an increased risk of fallopian tube cancer and peritoneal cancer in women, LEARN MORE!

For patients with breast cancer and ovar - ian cancer, early identification of a BRCA mutation will significantly help in creating a treatment plan. Patients who test positive for a BRCA mutation may respond to certain therapies better than those who do not have the mutation, and may be eligible for different clinical trials. Inherited gene mutations can't be repaired, but they can be found through genetic testing. Requiring little more than a simple blood draw or saliva sample, genetic testing is now avail - able for dozens of hereditary cancer syndromes, which are caused by alterations in genes that suppress or activate tumor growth. But genetic testing should only be done within the frame - work of genetic counseling. Genetic counselors help patients decide whether to undergo genetic testing and help them understand the results and provide context. Working with genetics professionals, patients and their families can explore the possi - ble consequences of genetic testing and develop realistic expectations of what might or might not be learned in the process. Patients might be candidates for genetic testing if they have one or more of the following: 4 Early-onset cancer (usually before age 50). 4 More than one cancer diagnosis. 4 A strong family history of cancer or the presence of rare cancers. IDENTIFYING INHERITED GENETIC RISK KTSDESIGN/ ADOBE STOCK60 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONThe details of what constitutes \"early-onset\" or \"strong family history\" vary according to the cancer type or specific genetic mutation. A pedi - gree is created based on family history of cancer to determine who will most likely benefit from genetic testing. Testing can provide information that either confirms high-risk status or rules out the presence of a genetic alteration found in other family members. For those who test positive for certain genetic mutations, increased screen - ing might be needed. Some patients might also consider chemoprevention strategies to help lower their risk of second cancers or recurrence. In other cases, cancer could be prevented with prophylactic procedures, such as surgery, or behaviors. Because gene alterations often predispose individuals to many types of cancer, identify - ing genetic status early can aid in diagnosis and medical decision making. It can also alert rela - tives that they might benefit from genetic testing, cancer screening and prevention measures. Patients considering genetic counseling should visit cancer.gov/cancertopics/genetics/directory to find a local genetic counselor.

Take Some Precautions, Too. PEOPLE WHO SUSPECT THAT THEY are predisposed to a certain inherited cancer, and who want to be tested to find out if they carry specific gene muta - tions, have a growing variety of genetic tests from which to choose. Testing of a person's DNA is offered for many of the more common inherited syndromes that can cause cancer, including hereditary breast cancer and ovarian cancer syndrome, caused by mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Others, each caused by specific gene mutations, include Li-Fraumeni syn and Von Hippel- Lindau syndrome. The tests for these mutations, many of which can look for multiple mutations associated with a specific disease, are often prescribed by a physician and require a small sample of body fluid or tissue, such as blood, saliva, cells from inside the cheek, skin cells or amniotic fluid. The tests are then sent to a lab and later returned to a doctor or genetic counselor, who can explain the results to patients. However, there are tests out there that can be taken without a doctor's prescription or guidance. These are called direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests that are often marketed to people online. They can be pur - chased via the internet or at local drug stores and may require a cheek swab or saliva sample that people can send through the mail. Test results are then sent back via mail, online or over the phone. These tests look for mutations to the BRCA genes, to those linked to Lynch syndrome and to others associated with a few health issues not related to cancer. While people are hoping to find answers about their genetic risks, they may not fully compre - hend the results. This is a problem that the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have pointed out with DTC genetic tests. Both agencies have stated that some of these tests lack scientific validity and should be taken in context only after a full medical evaluation. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) advises seeing a genetic counselor, doctor or other health care pro - fessional trained in genetics to discuss results and what the next steps should be. These may include preventive care, screening, referral to support groups, the provision of emotional support and help with decisions about whether other family members need to be tested. For those who do choose to go with a DTC genetic test, the NCI suggests using a laboratory that meets both state and federal testing guidelines. Currently, labs that perform genetic testing are subject to the federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. While their ease of access may make these tests appealing, they do not come without a price. The cheaper tests run about a couple of hundred dol - lars, and panels testing for multiple conditions or gene mutations can cost into the thousands. It's important to note that, often, these costs are not covered by health insurance. Before ordering a test, check the company's pri - vacy policy, including its rules about giving data to police who request it. Furthermore, there has been an uptick in unquali - fied \"health advocates\" promoting DTC genetic tests to consumers with promises of free testing to people who don't qualify for it, and who may use personal health care information to fraudulently bill insurance companies.

Ten days later, in the same hospital, my mother received a diagnosis of ovarian cancer. I spent my days visiting my mother and my daughters. One generation up; one generation down \u2014 just two floors apart, but their stories were more closely connected than we understood. Not long after my mother's initial diagnosis, we discovered that she was BRCA1 positive. Being posi - tive for a mutation in the BRCA gene meant that she faced up to a 72% chance of developing breast cancer and up to a 44% chance of developing ovar - ian cancer over the course of her life. It also meant that there was a 50% chance that she had passed this genetic mutation on to me. When my daughters were 4 months old, I decided to undergo genetic testing. Weeks later, when my results were in, I took one look at my genetic counselor's face and knew that I, like my mother, am BRCA1 positive. Today, I am blessed with three chil - dren: twin daughters and a son. I often think about whether they have inherited the same gene muta - tion I carry. There is no doubt that my children will have questions. I knew I would have to find a way to provide answers without overwhelming them with all the information they'll need to make screening decisions as adults. I decided I would tell them a story \u2014 our story. My children love telling stories so much that they often create small picture books for my husband and me. It was from their works that I was inspired to create a picture book for young children, \"Mom's Genes, \" that would help us start a much-needed conversation about our family's health history. Because my children are still quite young, I knew I would have to approach this conversation slowly and in a way that they would understand. By lightly introducing the concepts of genetics and family health history, \"Mom's Genes\" was meant to ignite that first conversation so that we could eventually dive deeper into these issues. The book helped my children recognize and talk about genetic traits that they may have inherited from members of the family. Then, when the chil - dren were concerned about my frequent medical visits, the book helped me explain that my doctors know my family's health history and use it to do plenty of checkups to keep me healthy. As genetic information and testing become more readily available, they will have a tremendous impact on medical decisions going forward. Families with certain genetic muta - tions face many complex and personal choices, including how and when to share such infor - mation with their children.

Whether they're looking for help in making decisions about their illness or news about the latest treatment options, patients have greater access to cancer information than ever before. Many websites provide basic knowledge about types of cancer, current clinical trials and available support. Some offer information on research articles, doctors and hospitals, treatment guide - lines, drugs, and complementary and alternative therapies. Always remember, not all information is good information. And bad information can hurt when it comes to cancer. USER, BEWARE! Cancer information on the internet comes from many different sources such as expert health organizations, government agencies, universities, merchants, interest groups, the general public and scam artists. Many of these sources really want to help others learn more. But because anyone can post information on the internet, information that is wrong can be passed along. Some information may be posted deliberately to try to deceive people. This is not to say that anything on the inter - net can't be trusted \u2014 just that it's important to choose sources carefully. Even on trusted, Adapted with permission of the American Cancer Society In searching for cancer information online, don't forget to check out the resources section of our Cancer Guide at curetoday.com/journey for a list of organizations that offer educational, emotional and financial support to patients and their loved ones.PART 2: AT DIAGNOSIS 65 highly regarded websites, the health information may not apply to a specific situation. Information found on the internet should not take the place of medical advice. Anyone with a health-related problem should talk to a doctor. There is no other way to get the same level of expe - rience and personalized care with doctors offering advice tailored to a patient's health history and unique medical situation. Online searches produce not only what's asked for but also commercial results, meaning that search engines may return spon - sored findings with their results. Often, these links are at the top of the results list. They might be in a box, in a different color, above a line or below a header, but users should be able to distinguish these links from the regular search results. The sponsored results are actually ads for other web - sites. Sometimes users will find the links helpful, but many of the sponsors are just trying to sell a product. ONLINE SUPPORT GROUPS, MAILING LISTS AND CHAT ROOMS People use online support groups to share information and support over the internet through chat rooms, discussion boards and mailing lists. These websites allow people to connect with others like them who might otherwise be diffi - cult to reach. They also allow users to keep their real identities private if they choose to do so. FINDING CANCER FACTS ONLINE ASK THE EXPERTS How to Evaluate Information Found Online WHEN EVALUATING information about cancer online, take these into consideration: 4Source: Reputable websites tell visitors, often on an \"About Us\" page, who's running the show. Are they health profession - als? What are their credentials? 4Red flags: No contact information, no physical address. 4Funding: The funding source should be clearly stated or apparent. The endings on web addresses \u2014 .com (commercial), .org (noncommercial organization), .edu (education), .gov (government) \u2014 are clues to the website's funding source, target audience and motives. 4Red flag: Unclear or unverified funding sources. 4Origin of content: Is content based on research findings published in reputable medical journals? Are there citations in the text that enable visitors to verify those findings? Nonprofes - sional opinions and advice, as well as individual case histories and testimonials (some of which might not be genuine), are poor substitutes for rigorous science. 4Red flag: Information collected from unidentified sources. 4Objectivity: Information should be unbiased, unless otherwise labeled, and complete. Reliable resources acknowledge that experts sometimes disagree about cancer causes and treatments. 4Red flags: Capital letters, exclamation points, descriptions such as \"miracle cure, \" \"secret ingredient\" and \"natural\" (which doesn't necessarily mean safe or effective). 4Currency of information: Content must be routinely updated because cancer research moves quickly. What was considered sound medical knowledge just a few years ago might not be valid today. 4Red flags: Undated content, broken links. 4Quality safeguards: At the best websites, an editorial board of top professionals with relevant expertise reviews the content. 4Privacy protections: A visitor's health information should remain confidential. Credible websites explain what they will and will not do with such information if they ask for it. Many commercial sites sell it to other companies. 66 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONSome people find online support groups and chat rooms helpful for sharing their experiences with other people facing the same things. Still, these places may not be the best sources of health information, especially if they are not monitored by trained profession - als or experts. Patients should discuss any information they get with their health care teams to see if it applies to their situation. EMAIL MESSAGES If patients share their contact infor - mation on websites, emails may start pouring in. Well-meaning friends and family also may send emails with cancer information and treatment options from various sources. Patients should carefully evaluate any email messages they receive. Consider the source of the message and its purpose. Many com - panies and organizations use email to advertise or attract people to their web - sites. The information's accuracy could be influenced by their desire to promote their product or service. One way to sift through the informa - tion is to identify respected, reliable sources of health information and use them as primary resources.

In times past, patients dutifully followed doctors' orders with few questions. Today, more patients are making medical decisions in partnership with their health care teams. It's not easy, due in part to the ever-increasing number of treatment options available. For some patients, the right choice is treat - ment with a goal of cure, as long as there is some chance that outcome is possible, and regardless of the risks and costs of treatment. For others, cure is not the best goal because the chance of achieving that outcome is low and the price (discomfort, travel, expense, risk of death or complications) is high.Doctors can provide patients with statistical data for each treatment option regarding chances of remission, cure rates, complications, side effects and mortality. They might be able to give some idea of what the treatment experience will be like. Survivors who have been through similar treatments can usually offer insight into what to expect, and doctors can refer patients who are willing to share their recollections and advice. As patients weigh their options and discuss them with their doctors, they should consider these steps: KNOW THE OPTIONS.

Research indicates that most patients want complete medical information from doctors and to share the decision-making authority with them by creating a true partnership. Different doctors could recommend different drug or treat - ment combinations at various intervals. Then again, the best treatment might be no treatment. Patients diagnosed with certain slow-growing cancers may be given the option of being closely monitored (\"watchful waiting\") if there are no serious symptoms. LEARN THE TRADE-OFFS.

Patients should take written questions to each appointment. Start with: Will you do genetic testing of the tumor to find out if it includes molecular targets that can be ad - dressed with targeted drugs or immunotherapies? How often do you treat this kind of cancer? Would a second opinion be helpful in establish - ing the diagnosis and making decisions about treatment? What is the goal of treatment? Is it curative? Or will it extend life or help with symptoms? What are the chances that the treatment will work? How will you determine if a treatment is working? If the treatment does not work, are there other options? What are the potential risks and side effects of the treatment, and how do they compare with those caused by other treatments? How will the treatment be given, how often and for how long? Are there ways to prepare for treatment to decrease the chance of side effects? Will daily activities be restricted in any way? Diet? Work? Exercise? Sex? Are there any clinical trials to consider? How much will treatment cost? Will it be covered by insurance? Are there less expensive treatments with similar effectiveness?

A medical decision can mean different things to different people. Patients should understand how medical deci - sions can affect their quality of life and how these choices may affect their loved ones. ACT WITH CONFIDENCE. It can be a tremendous relief for both patient and doctor once they settle on a treatment plan, but in the world of cancer, each decision carries a measure of uncertainty. Patients soon come to understand what oncologists have always known: Their treatments might or might not be effective. But in all cases, it is important that patients follow through with their plans, knowing that they are making the wisest choices they can at that time.

In fact, getting a second opinion is common, and several situations could actu - ally call for one. Whether there is concern about a recom - mended treatment or just a desire to hear the diagnosis confirmed from another physi - cian, a second opinion is appropriate. A patient might also seek a second opinion if the pathologist is having difficulty making a diagnosis, if he or she has a rare type of can - cer that the doctor is unfamiliar with, if the patient thinks the doctor underestimates the seriousness of the disease or if the medical insurance plan requires one. Patients can request a second review of their pathology slides or another opinion about treatment if their choices are numer - ous and they want reassurance they have chosen wisely. A second opinion can clarify a diagnosis or provide treatment options about which a patient was not aware, including those offered through clinical trials. FIND REFERRALS Patients should seek a second opinion from a physician outside their current doctor's prac - tice. They shouldn't worry about offending their doctor; most oncologists expect patients to seek a second opinion. Some suggest it and offer recommendations. LEARN MORE!

YOU RECEIVE A CANCER DIAGNOSIS YOU HAVE A RARE FORM OF CANCER THE TYPE OF CANCER HAS MANY DIFFERENT TREATMENT OPTIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE EXPERIMENTAL YOU UNDERSTAND THE TREATMENT OPTIONS AND ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE PROPOSED TREATMENT YOU ARE CONFIDENT OF YOUR PHYSICIAN'S SKILL AND THE PHYSICIAN'S ABILITY TO TREAT THE CANCER CONSIDER GETTING A SECOND OPINION YOU MIGHT NOT NEED A SECOND OPINION YES NO YES NO YES NO NO YESPART 3: CHOOSING TREATMENT75 Many local hospitals, regional cancer centers and institutions, including the National Cancer Institute (cancer.gov) and the National Com - prehensive Cancer Network (nccn.org), have physician referral services that provide consul - tations for second opinions. Some large cancer centers have formal second-opinion programs designed to provide advice quickly. They do this by scheduling patients to see doctors of differ - ent specialties all in one day. In addition, some cancer centers offer second opinions from afar, based on records and images that are sent to them. This allows patients to seek second opin - ions from top experts without traveling. Seeking a second opinion from an expert in the patient's specific cancer can provide another viewpoint. Such an expert could suggest clinical trials the patient's doctor might be unaware of or confirm a treatment recommendation. People in support groups and other cancer survivors can also be good sources for recom - mending oncologists and specialists. Patients can also identify experts through sci - entific journal articles about their cancer types. Doctors who have authored several articles on a particular cancer are generally considered experts and might be available for a second opinion and consultations. Patients should inquire about online or telephone referrals, especially if they want a second opinion from an expert at a large cancer center or one who practices far from where they live. Be aware, however, that consultations can be expensive and might not be covered by insurance. COVER ALL THE BASES Before seeking a second opinion patients should obtain information about their disease, including diagnosis, staging, treatment options and how recurrence might be prevented. They should ask their physician to send test results and imaging scans to the consulting doctor. Patients might need to repeat some tests, but the second doctor will want to look over existing test results and scans. Some insurance plans cover, or even require, second opinions before approving payment for treatment. Some plans limit coverage to certain physicians or hospitals, so it is always best for patients to consider their plans when coordinat - ing second-opinion appointments. WEIGH THE OPTIONS Some patients might get confused about what advice to follow if the second doctor recom - mends a different treatment, which might be likely if their cancer does not have a set standard of therapy. For example both surgery and radiation therapy might be suggested as options for a patient with early prostate cancer, because both treatments have excellent long-term cure rates. A urologist who specializes in prostate surgery might be more inclined to recommend surgery than a radiation oncologist would. In that case, the decision would depend on how the patient weighs the side effects of each treatment in relation to his own personal views and lifestyle. A patient's primary care physician could also have helpful advice about weighing inconsistent recommendations. Patients might also want to seek a third opinion if they are still uncomfortable with their diagno - sis or treatment options. Although it might not be necessary for their cancer to be treated by a specialist, they might want to hear the opinion of someone who focuses only on their type of cancer, especially if their first two doctors recom - mended different therapies or had conflicting diagnosis results. After weighing the options, patients must decide on their medical teams. Most patients proceed with their initial doctors, but comfort level, proposed treatment options and medical expertise should all be evaluated when making a decision. SEEKING A SECOND OPINION76 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONSSCIENTISTS CONTINUE TO LEARN more about cancer's biology and how it affects each patient. As they make new discoveries, they are able to refine existing treatments and develop new ones. In addition, research continues to lead to new combinations of different types of drugs that fight cancer more effectively together, such as pairings of chemotherapy with radiation or groupings of chemotherapy with immunotherapy and a targeted drug. SURGERY In many cases, surgery can be used to remove a tumor and, depending on the pathology of the cancer, the surrounding tissue. In some circumstances, patients might be eligible for less invasive surgical options. Laparoscopic surgery requires one or more small incisions that allow a thin fiber-optic scope, called a laparoscope, and specially designed surgical instruments to be inserted into the body to remove the tumor. Disease- free survival and recurrence rates for specific tumor types and stages seem to be about the same with laparoscopic surgery compared with traditional open surgery. The main benefits are faster recovery times, shorter hospital stays and fewer complications. A similar technique, used for lung and other thoracic cancers, is thoracoscopic surgery, during which a tiny camera and surgical instruments are inserted through a thin incision in the chest wall. Robot- assisted surgery could have even more benefits for some patients. As with laparo - scopic surgery, robot-assisted procedures require a few small incisions. But instead of directly manipulating the surgical instruments, Making Sense of Cancer Therapies Proven approaches and new technologies mean individualized treatmentLEARN MORE!

The process enables finer movements yet prevents the surgeon from feeling the tissue in the same way as in open surgery. In addition to prostatectomy (surgery to remove the prostate gland), robot-assisted sur - gery can be used for hysterectomy to treat cervical and endometrial cancers, and to treat some blad - der, throat, thyroid and kidney cancers. When performed correctly by well-trained surgeons in appropriate patients, robot-assisted procedures have the potential to prevent some short-term complications, such as blood loss, and to reduce the length of hospital stays compared with open surgery. Radiofrequency ablation, or RFA, is an outpatient procedure that uses heat delivered through a thin, needle-like probe inserted into the tumor to kill tumor cells. Cryoablation is a similar procedure that uses rapid freezing and thawing to kill the cancer cells. RADIATION THERAPY Radiation therapy is used alone to treat some cancers, but most often in combination with other therapies to improve the cure rate after surgery. Radiation could also be used to allow less extensive surgery or to relieve side effects of advanced cancer. High doses of radiation can cause side effects after treatment, as well as late effects, such as second - ary cancers. Newer specialized techniques more accurately target radiation to tumors and minimize these effects. TARGETED RADIATION THERAPY TYPES Brachytherapy radiates the cancer cells directly by implanting radioactive seeds or wires into the body in or near the tumor. Brachytherapy is used in pros - tate, cervical and other cancers. Brachytherapy can also be used in breast cancer. This is a type of partial breast irradiation and is sometimes used for smaller, lymph node-negative, lower-risk breast cancers.ILLUSTRATION BY ERIN MOORE COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL RADIATION therapy, which can kill cancer cells but also damage healthy tissue, specialized techniques deliver radiation to the tumor more precisely, with less severe side effects. COMPARING RADIATION THERAPIES X-ray Beam X-rays are high-energy photons created by machines, and although the beam can be aimed at a tumor, the radiation dose is also delivered to healthy tissue in front of and behind the tumor. The energy breaks DNA bonds, causing cell death. Stereotactic Radiosurgery Stereotactic radiosurgery uses highly focused X-rays or gamma rays that originate at many different angles and intersect at the tumor site. The tumor is hit with a high, concentrated dose of radiation, sparing surrounding healthy tissue from the full dose. Proton Beam The larger size of a proton particle, used in specific cases, ensures that the bulk of energy is deposited exactly at the tumor site, allowing more precise treatment and, in some cases, treatment of areas previously radiated with standard radiation. MAKING SENSE OF CANCER THERAPIES78 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONRadiopharmaceuticals contain radioactive elements that deliver radiation directly to tumors. These injections are approved to treat bone metastases in prostate and thyroid cancers, as well as some types of lymphoma, and to alleviate cancer-related bone pain; these drugs can also be delivered to tumors in the liver. Conformal radiation uses several weak radiation beams originating from different angles that intersect to produce a concentrated high dose of radiation at the tumor site. Advanced conformal therapy, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy, uses multiple beams with varying intensity. Stereotactic radiosurgery, such as Gamma Knife, uses a computer to simultaneously focus about 200 small beams onto a tumor in the brain while the patient's head is immobilized in a special helmet. A similar technique, known as CyberKnife, bypasses the need for the helmet by using imaging to make adjustments for movements. Gamma Knife is used for small- to medium-sized tumors in the brain, and CyberKnife is employed for larger tumors and tumors in other areas of the body. Proton beam therapy uses positively charged par - ticles, called protons, that only travel a certain distance. The method allows doctors to control the depth of radiation more precisely and deliver more of it to tumors while sparing nearby healthy tis - sue. Proton beam therapy is used for some childhood cancers and certain cancers of the brain, central nervous system, eye, head and neck, liver and lung, and some sarcomas. It's also being investigated in breast, esophageal, prostate and other cancers. More research is needed to determine if side effects are less intense than with older types of radiation. CHEMOTHERAPY While surgery and radiation target the tumor, chemotherapy targets the whole body systemi - cally through a number of mechanisms of action. New chemotherapy drugs are more effective and less toxic than agents developed 50 years ago, due to greater knowledge about how to deliver them, including optimal dose and frequency of dose, alone and in combination. Chemotherapy can be given as the primary \u2014 or main \u2014 treatment for some cancers, such as lym - phoma and leukemia. It can also be given after the cancer has been removed as adjuvant therapy, which might improve survival and delay or prevent disease progression. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given before surgery to shrink tumors enough to permit less extensive surgery. When cancer is not curable, palliative chemotherapy can often reduce symptoms caused by tumors and help people live longer. CLASSES OF CHEMOTHERAPY AGENTS Antimicrotubule agents disrupt mitosis, a phase of cell division in which a cell duplicates and separates the chromosomes in its cell nucleus. Mitotic inhibi - tors include taxanes and vinca alkaloids (which are approved to treat some solid tumors, as well as lym - phomas and leukemias) and epothilones (which are used to treat advanced breast cancer when taxanes no longer work). Mitotic inhibitors are known for their potential to cause peripheral nerve injury (neu - ropathy), a potential dose-limiting side effect. Alkylating agents are used to treat blood-related cancers, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic leukemias and multiple mye - loma, and are also effective in breast, lung, ovarian and some gastrointestinal cancers. Alkylating agents work by damaging the DNA of cancer cells to pre - vent them from dividing and multiplying. This group includes platinum-based chemotherapies. Antimetabolites interfere with DNA and RNA production. They are effective in a specific cycle of cell growth and are used against leukemias, lym - phomas and cancers of the ovary, breast, gastrointestinal tract and lung. Topoisomerase inhibitors interfere with enzymes that are important for accurate DNA replication. ILLUSTRATION BY ERIN MOOREPART 3: CHOOSING TREATMENT79 DNA double helix YONDELIS (trabectedin) and HALAVEN (eribulin) are the first chemotherapies originally derived from marine life, although they are now synthetically made. Both of these alkylating agents are approved for the treatment of liposarcoma, and Yondelis also for the treatment of leiomyosarcoma. These conditions are types of soft-tissue sarcoma, meaning that they are among at least 50 rare cancers that have individual characteristics but start in the body's connective tissues. Halaven is also approved for the treatment of breast cancer. MARINE-DERIVED CANCER TREATMENTS 3 Most DNA-targeted drugs bind to the major groove. The binding of Yondelis to the minor groove allows the drug to interact with specific proteins in cancer cells, preventing cell copying and causing double-strand breaks in DNA. This leads to the failure of DNA to properly divide and, in turn, activates programmed cell death.2 Yondelis binds to the minor groove of DNA, and this distorts the double helix, causing it to bend. 1 Yondelis has two regions: one that binds to DNA and another that protrudes from the DNA so it can interact with cellular proteins, particularly DNA cleaving enzymes.DNA cleaving enzymemajor grooveminor groove 1 The mitotic spindle is a mechanism responsible for furnishing newly forming cells with chromosomes, which contain each cell's DNA. During mitosis, or cell division, chromosomes line up along the mitotic spindle. 3 The microtubules are in a constant state of polymerization (growth) and depolymerization (shortening), which causes the microtubules to be unstable. This instability is a crucial component of mitosis. 4 Halaven blocks microtubule growth by binding to the growing ends of the microtubules. When this blocking occurs, cancer cell division ceases. The cells ultimately die. Halaven does not interfere with microtubule shortening.2 The mitotic spindle is made up of microtubules, which are composed of tubulin subunits (dimers). GROWTHYONDELIS was originally made from sea squirts, or the marine organism Ecteinascidia turbinata. It works by stopping the abnormal multiplication of cancer cells within the body that would otherwise spread, destroying nearby tissues. It does this by binding to and damaging the DNA in cancer cells, causing the cells to die. HALAVEN was derived from an antibiotic substance, halichondrin B, that is produced by a type of black sponge that lives along the coast of Japan. The drug works by stopping the process of cell division within cancer cells. SHORTENING PolymerizationDepolymerizationILLUSTRATION BY ERIN MOORE MAKING SENSE OF CANCER THERAPIES80 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONThey are used to treat certain types of leukemia, as well as colorectal, gastrointestinal, lung, ovarian and other cancers. Anthracyclines are anti-tumor antibiotics that inter - fere with enzymes involved in DNA replication. Anthracyclines treat a variety of tumors and work in all phases of the cell cycle. Because they can dam - age the heart muscle, anthracyclines have a lifetime dose limitation. STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION Bone marrow, the spongy material inside the bone, is the natural home for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), the \"parent cells\" that develop into different types of blood cells. These stem cells can be retrieved from either the patient (called an autologous transplantation) or a donor (an allogeneic transplan - tation). Patients who provide their own HSCs have them removed from the bone marrow or the blood - stream prior to chemotherapy and/or radiation, and the cells are frozen for later use. In other cases, the HSCs come from a donor, who might be an identi - cal twin, another close relative (often a sibling), an unrelated person or even an unrelated newborn. Patients with leukemia, myeloma, low-grade lym - phoma, myelodysplastic syndromes and, less often, various other cancers, might be treated with stem cell transplantation. High doses of radiation and/or chemotherapy have the unwanted side effect of damaging a patient's bone marrow stem cells. Transplantation restores the patient's bone marrow. Over time, the infused cells divide and mature into cells normally pro - duced by healthy bone marrow, a process known as engraftment. When donor cells mount an immune attack on residual cancer cells, the effect is called graft-versus-tumor. Graft-versus-host disease, or GVHD, can occur after allogeneic transplantation if the donor immune cells view the recipient's body as foreign. The recipi - ent's immune system has largely been destroyed by conditioning treatment and cannot fight back. The donor immune cells can attack certain organs (most often the skin, liver and gastrointestinal tract), which impairs the organs' ability to function, while the required suppression of the immune system increases the chance of infection. About one-third to one-half of patients who receive an allogeneic transplantation develop acute GVHD within 25 days (on average). Serious cases of uncon - trolled GVHD, though uncommon, can be fatal. HORMONE THERAPY Hormone therapies interfere with the interaction of sex hormones (androgens and estrogens) and some types of cancer, particularly breast and prostate. Hormone therapy can be used alone or with other treatments. Following surgery, women with breast cancer that is shown to be fueled by estrogen are treated with an estrogen blocker and/or drugs called aromatase inhibitors. These drugs are taken for at least five years. Aromatase inhibitors block an enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens in postmenopausal women . Patients with prostate cancer could receive androgen-deprivation therapy to lower testosterone levels. Another group of drugs, known as anti- androgens, are sometimes helpful if other hormone therapies stop working. Removing the ovaries or testicles can also reduce the level of sex hormones. TARGETED THERAPY Researchers have learned more about specific molecular changes responsible for cancer growth, resulting in new drugs called targeted therapies. These drugs target genes or proteins in the cell. However, many of these newer agents must be combined with traditional chemotherapy, and some carry their own side effects, such as rash, diarrhea, heart malfunction or high blood pressure. Angiogenesis inhibitors prevent the formation of new blood vessels to the tumor (angiogenesis). Shutting down its blood supply shrinks the tumor, which needs nutrients and oxygen from blood to survive and grow.

Kinase inhibitors block enzymes with a variety of func - tions, including angiogenesis, growth factor receptors and other aspects of cell signaling, and are used in treat - ing many types of cancer. Proteasome inhibitors treat multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma by blocking multi-enzyme complexes called proteasomes. These molecules break down proteins involved in regulating cell processes relevant to cancer. mTOR inhibitors block a key protein in cells that regu - lates cell growth and survival. These inhibitors block the translation of genes that regulate the cell cycle and reduce levels of certain growth factors involved in the development of new blood vessels, such as VEGF . mTOR inhibitors are currently used for breast, kidney, neu - roendocrine and other cancers. PARP inhibitors block the activity of an enzyme that helps cancer cells repair their DNA when it's damaged. This can cause the cells to die. Often, these drugs work well in cancers with inherited or acquired mutations to the BRCA genes, because these cancers already have DNA repair problems and the medications further inter - fere with that process. PARP inhibitors are used to treat breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancers.

They have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for many types of cancer. Antibody-drug conjugates use a linker to attach one of these drugs to a potent chemotherapy agent. The anti - body delivers the chemotherapy to cancer cells, and, once the drug is absorbed by the cells, the linker releases the chemotherapy. The FDA has approved this type of treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer and certain types of lymphoma. (See page 84 to learn more about immunotherapies.) IMMUNOTHERAPY Drugs that stimulate the body's immune system to attack cancer are known as immunotherapies. In the pages immediately ahead, we explore immunotherapy types including checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy.

These drugs are approved to treat multiple myeloma and T-cell lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-manu - factured versions of natural human antibodies, proteins made by the immune system to fight invaders such as cancer. Monoclonal antibodies are designed to seek out and bind to antigens, or markers, on the surfaces of cancer cells, thus stimulating the immune system to attack those cells. These drugs are approved to treat many can - cer types, including breast, blood and colorectal. Antibody-drug conjugates combine two kinds of drugs.

By combining agents that use different strategies, scientists are gaining ground on cancer. CANCER THERAPY'S MANY TARGETS It only takes a small percentage of cancer cells to break away from the tumor and invade other organs via the bloodstream or lymph system. Methods to block cell mobility and ultimately prevent metastasis are under way.Proteins, such as VEGF, are secreted by cancer cells to signal blood vessel growth to the tumor. Anti-angiogenic drugs block these proteins and starve the tumor of nutrients. Hormones spur the growth of hormone- dependent breast, ovarian and prostate cancers. Hormonal agents cut off the effect of hormones on cancer cells by either lowering hormone levels or blocking receptors. Growth factors signal the cell to continue multiplying at an abnormal rate. When targeted agents bind to these growth factors or their intended receptors, the pathway is halted or turned off.DNA contains the cancer cell's instructions to multiply and resist death. Chemotherapy targets the DNA of these fast-growing cancer cells, stopping proliferation and causing cell death.ANGIOGENESISMETASTASIS PROLIFERATION GROWTH FACTORSHORMONESPART 3: CHOOSING TREATMENT83 WEARABLE DEVICES Wearable therapeutic devices are newer techniques. One of them, Optune, is approved to treat the brain cancer glio - blastoma. Designed to be worn 18 hours a day, the device uses tumor-treating electromagnetic fields to prevent cancer DNA from dividing and multiplying. A product called Quell is for cancer pain. It wraps around the calf and sends low-frequency electricity to sensory nerves, causing the brain to block pain signals. Other wearable devices include scalp cooling caps, worn for a period of time before, during and after chemotherapy infusions to help prevent hair loss. Additionally, devices that may detect certain types of cancer are being studied. NEOADJUVANT AND ADJUVANT TREATMENTS ENHANCE PRIMARY THERAPY It is becoming more common for patients with cancer to get neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatments, which are given before and/or after the main therapy. These thera - pies are used in cancers including breast, lung, bladder, colon and ovarian. Neoadjuvant treatments are often given before sur - gery to shrink a tumor so it is easier to fully remove. In some cases, the amount of shrinkage affects sub - sequent treatment decisions. The goal of adjuvant treatment is to prevent recurrence or spread by killing any cancer cells that linger after the primary treatment, which in many cases is surgery. A number of treatments can be used as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies, including chemotherapy, targeted drugs, radiation and hormone-blocking medications. Immunotherapy is available as an adjuvant therapy and is being studied as a potential neoadjuvant treatment. These before-and-after treatments are given when scientific evidence shows that they are likely to improve health outcomes based on the cancer's type and stage. They are typically given to patients whose cancer has grown past the very earliest stage, so there is a risk it could leave cells behind after primary treatment, but not to the metastatic stage, meaning it has reached distant parts of the body. Patients with cancers driven by muta - tions associated with a high risk of recurrence might also benefit from neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant treatments.Like primary treatments, these types of treatments can cause side effects, so patients should talk with a doctor about the types of therapies recommended, how much they are expected to lower risk of recurrence or cancer death, how they will affect daily life and for how long. WARD ILLUSTRATION BY RAY PELESKO MAKING SENSE OF CANCER THERAPIES ADVICE FROM a SURVIVOR EMILY WARD \"To get a grasp of my situation, I had to spend a lot of time doing my own research. I had to become an advocate for my own health, as most doctors in Maine had never heard of (mesothelioma) except for the legal commercials on TV. I knew I didn't want to sacrifice my quality of life for more time on this earth. I had to be the one to push for a lower dose on my pain medications. In a similar situation a few years later, after my third round of chemotherapy began to take a heavy toll, I had to speak up and ultimately decided to stop treatment. Thanks to the continued efforts and honest opinion of my current oncologist, I decided to begin treatment again, this time with (an) experimental immunotherapy drug. I recently celebrated seven years as a mesothelioma survivor. I wholeheartedly believe that I would not have made it this long without the research I did. Patients need to ensure they understand and trust everything they are being fed by their health care team. It is every patient's responsibility to become self-educated on what they can do to help beat their cancer, whether that's making the decision to travel further away to receive treatment from a specialist or seeking the guidance of an outside advocacy group. Ultimately, patients should feel informed enough to choose and determine which options are right for them. \" SCAN THE QR CODE to read EMILY'S story.84 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONIIMMUNOTHERAPY IS A RAPIDLY evolving strategy that enlists the body's own immune system to fight cancer. These treatments work by stimulating the production and activity of T cells and antibodies, which exist naturally in the body and have the ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. Types of cancer that can be treated with im - munotherapies approved by the Food and Drug Administration include melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and kid - ney, bladder, lung, prostate, breast, colorectal, liver, gastric, cervical, uterine, brain, pancreatic, esophageal and head and neck cancers. Immu - notherapies are also being tested in other forms of cancer, including additional blood cancers. Combinations of these drug types with each other, or with other anti-cancer therapies, may be more effective for some patients. While immunotherapies don't cause the hair loss that comes with chemotherapy, they can spark nausea, rash, fever, chills, fatigue, diarrhea or even severe autoimmune reactions or endo - crine hormone deficiencies. These drugs can also be very expensive. So far, 20% to 30% of patients with immu - notherapy-treatable cancers respond, and researchers are asking why, and figuring out how to make the most of the treatments. Some responses can be long-lasting or curative, so there is interest in refining this approach and expanding the number of patients and types of tumors that can be successfully treated.Delving Into Immunotherapy Understanding how the immune system controls itself has led to impressive treatment gains LEARN MORE!

ILLUSTRATION BY ERIN MOOREPART 3: CHOOSING TREATMENT 85 IMMUNOTHERAPIES CALLED CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS are changing the landscape of treatment for lung, melanoma and other cancers. Several approved immunotherapies inhibit the PD-1/PD-L1 cell signaling pathway, and one inhibits the CTLA-4 pathway. All of these drugs work by taking the brakes off the immune system and boosting its power to fight cancer. IMMUNOTHERAPY FOR LUNG AND OTHER CANCERS PD-1/PD-L1 Pathway CTLA-4 Pathway Immune cells (T cells) are activated when the major his - tocompatibility complex (MHC) \u2014 a molecule on a tumor cell or on an antigen-presenting cell (APC) \u2014 interacts with the T-cell receptor (TCR) on a T cell. Specifically, the MHC presents an antigen to the TCR, telling it what it should be activated against.Interaction between MHC molecules and T-cell receptors results in the activation of T cells against cancer, through the presentation of an antigen.ANTIGENS produced by tumor cells Immune cells can be downregulated, or decreased, when CTLA-4, a protein receptor on the T cell, binds with the protein B7. This interaction prevents T cells from destroying cancer cells. A protein on the T cell called PD-1 can bind with the ligands (molecules) PD-L1 and, to a lesser degree, PD-L2, dampening the immune response. Blocking the interaction between CTLA-4 and B7 with a CTLA-4 inhibitor, like Yervoy (ipilimumab), allows the T cell to stay active, proliferate and attack the tumor. Blocking PD-1 the T cells to remain activated against the tumor. 1 T-Cell Activation1 T-Cell Activation 2 Immune Evasion 2 Immune Evasion 3 Treatment 3 TreatmentDELVING INTO IMMUNOTHERAPYILLUSTRATION BY ERIN MOORE86 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONCYTOKINES Some cytokines, such as interleukins and interferons, which are found naturally in the body, can also be produced in the laboratory and given to patients to change the way their immune systems are regulated, potentially stimulating immune responses. These approved drugs are used to treat melanoma, kidney and bladder cancers, although they work only in a mi - nority of those patients, and side effects can be severe. IMMUNE CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS While T cells have cancer-killing ability, they are normally held somewhat at bay by \"inhibitory check - points\" in the immune system. The job of these check - points is to keep the T cells from engaging in out-of- control activity. The problem with this system is that cancers can hide in the body by sending out the same signals as these checkpoints, along the cell-signaling pathways PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4; this way, T cells don't recognize or fight them. One group of immunotherapy drugs blocks this kind of signaling so that the checkpoints no longer have a hold over the activity of T cells. This frees up the T cells to fight cancer. However, in doing so, the immune cells also at - tack some normal tissue, causing a variety of side effects. Checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of a variety of solid tumor types, and continue to be tested in clinical trials. They are also approved to treat any cancer, regardless of type, that is considered microsatellite instability-high, meaning that cancer cells are unable to repair their own DNA when it's damaged. MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES When the immune system is provoked by foreign cells and other substances, it reacts by activating T-cell lym - phocytes (a type of white blood cell), which can directly kill foreign cells, and by stimulating B-cell lymphocytes to make proteins called antibodies. These antibod - ies are drawn to other proteins known as antigens, which sit perched on the outsides of cells; drawn like magnets, the antibodies attach to the antigens. Once in place, the antibodies call in the immune system to destroy the cells to which they are attached.Monoclonal antibodies, which are designed to seek and destroy specific cancer-associated antigens, can be made in a lab and then given to patients. Some of these strictly target one type of antigen, but cannot always fight tumors on their own. Bispecific antibodies may be more effective, because they can bind to, and destroy, two different anti - gens present on one or many cells. One antibody enlists a T cell while the other targets a tumor, bringing the main partners of the immune process together. ADOPTIVE T-CELL THERAPY If a good immune response is already happening in a patient's body, adoptive T-cell therapy may improve it. In adoptive cell transfer, a sample of a patient's tumor is sent to a lab, where T cells inside the tumor are removed and stimulated to recognize a tumor surface protein and increase in number. Then, this larger group of T cells, known as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, is returned to the patient intravenously. This experimental method has been shown to induce complete, durable regression of certain malignancies, including a number of blood cancers and melanoma. CHIMERIC ANTIGEN RECEPTOR THERAPY Like adoptive T-cell therapy, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy involves manipulating a patient's T cells in a lab. But in this case, the T cells are genetically modified to express a specific surface receptor, which prepares them to home in on, and attack, specific pro - teins on a particular kind of cancer cell. When the CAR T cells are infused into the patient's body, they can multiply and continue to eradicate tumors over time. Currently, there are two CAR-T cell therapies approved in the U.S. One is for advanced or recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and young adults. The other is for certain types of advanced or recurrent non-Hodgkin lym - phoma. Clinical trials have shown that this method can also have significant anti-tumor activity in neuroblas - toma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and trials are exploring CAR-T cell therapy in an array of solid tumors and blood cancers that affect both children and adults. CAR-T cell therapy is carried out in the hospital, where patients are monitored closely for side effects, ILLUSTRATION BY ELAINE KURIEPART 3: CHOOSING TREATMENT87 DELVING INTO IMMUNOTHERAPYILLUSTRATION BY ELAINE KURIE CAR-T CELL THERAPYCHIMERIC ANTIGEN RECEPTOR (CAR)-T cell therapy is a form of immunotherapy. This laboratory-assisted method modifies a patient's own immune cells to fight cancer that has developed in the body. The therapy involves removing a patient's T cells and \"engineering\" them to recognize and attack a cancer-specific antigen, or molecule, on the surface of cancer cells. A genetic sequence is inserted into the T cells, causing them to develop receptors capable of binding to the antigens on cancer cells. Binding triggers the T cells to destroy the malignant cells. Two CAR-T cell therapies have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration: Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, respectively. These drugs target the antigen CD19 that sits on cancer cells associated with those malignancies. In addition, scientists are testing CAR-T cell therapies that target the antigen BCMA on multiple myeloma cells.Doctors start CAR-T cell therapy by removing blood from a patient, separating and storing T cells, and returning the remainder of the blood to the patient's body.1 2 3 4 5Laboratory technicians insert a synthetic form of the desired T cell receptor-encoding gene sequence (known as a vector) into the T cells via an inactivated virus or another delivery method, such as a cationic polymer.Inserting the vector causes the T cells to express receptors (CARs) on their surfaces, enabling them to find and fight the antigen associated with the patient's cancer. The \"armed\" T cells are multiplied in the lab into the hundreds of millions. The engineered T cells are infused into the patient.CAR-T CELL VECTORT CELLS As a result of this attack, the cancer cells are destroyed. The engineered T cells continue to circulate in the patient's blood, prepared to attack any similar cancer cells that appear.The activated T cells release perforins, proteins that pierce the cancer cell membrane. The T cells then release granulysin, a substance that enters the cancer cell through the holes made by the perforins. The reinfused T cells do what they were trained to do: seek out cancer cells marked by a specific antigen, and lock onto that antigen wher - ever they find it. Binding activates the T cells so they can multiply.6 7 8 9PerforinsCAR-T cellCancer cell Granulysins88 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONparticularly the immune system's potential attack on healthy organs. VACCINES A host of vaccines, some approved and some exper - imental, also fall into the immunotherapy category. There are four main basic types: 4\u0007Vaccines that use an engineered inactivated virus to deliver an agent such as a cytokine that can cause the destruction of cancer cells. 4\u0007Vaccines that send whole tumor cells into the body with the goal of drawing the immune sys - tem's attention to the foreign cells so it will fight them \u2014 as well as the tumor cells already grow - ing in the body. 4\u0007Infused dendritic cell vaccines , which are made uniquely for each patient using his or her own white blood cells, mixed with an agent that will help the body mount an immune response against cancer cells. 4\u0007Peptide vaccines. These include a small peptide (amino acid) sequence taken from a tumor-asso - ciated antigen. This is mixed with an agent that stimulates dendritic cells to process the pep - tide sequence; in turn, that causes the immune system to recognize and fight any antigens that contain the sequence. SOME PATIENTS WITH CANCER may not be candidates for immunotherapy. Despite all the fanfare about immunotherapies in cancer care, these drugs are not for everyone. Those with certain other conditions are not good candidates for the drugs, and should mention these concerns to their oncologists. Here are three potential contraindica - tions to immunotherapy use, ac - cording to Marianne Davies, NP , an oncology nurse practitioner at the Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale-New Haven and an assistant professor at the Yale School of Nursing: 4 Autoimmune Conditions. Because immunotherapy works by activating T cells to attack cancer, it can also inflame healthy tissues, meaning that patients with autoim - mune conditions, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn dis - ease, who already have hyperactive immune systems, are not appropri - ate for the therapy. \"It has the potential to have a significant increase in morbidity, perhaps even mortality, for those patients, \" cautions Davies. Similarly, patients who have undergone a prior organ transplant or who have a history of liver damage would not be good candidates for the therapy. 4 Steroid Use. Ongoing use of steroids to treat a health condition other than cancer is also contraindi - cated, since steroids may suppress the effects of immunotherapy. As a result, unless such patients can be tapered off the steroids, they are not considered good candidates for immunotherapy. It's true that steroids are some - times transiently used in patients who have been taking immunother - apy, to treat immune-related side effects. However, immunotherapy is often temporarily or permanently halted during the course of this steroid treatment. In addition to steroids, patients should be monitored for all prescrip - tion and nonprescription medica - tions, including vitamins and herbal supplements, to make sure those products are safe to take along with immunotherapy, and will not diminish the immunotherapy's effectiveness. 4 Aggressive Disease. Patients with a very high tumor burden or rapidly growing cancers may want to opt for chemotherapy or radia - tion \u2014 or, in the case of brain lesions, stereotactic radiosurgery \u2014 before moving on to immunotherapy, be - cause these treatments work more quickly than immunotherapy. STAYING SAFE When to Avoid ImmunotherapyPART 3: CHOOSING TREATMENT89 CCLINICAL TRIALS provide data that prove whether a new treatment is better than the standard therapy. They could offer alternatives if patients have few treat - ment options or if they're seeking a treatment with the potential of being more beneficial than the standard treatment. Choosing a clinical trial might mean patients can find an option with fewer toxicities than the one being offered or one that is more convenient, such as an oral medication or one with a shorter treatment time. Although an increasing number of investigational cancer drugs are being approved by the Food and Drug Admin - istration (FDA) each year, the process is still lengthy and complex. If patients can navigate the process, they might find a good option, but it's important to understand the phases involved in clinical trials and the potential benefit. Phase 0 trials are the first to move a drug out of the laboratory and into people. Their goal is to determine how the body handles a specific drug. These trials are very small, including only 10 to 15 people, usually healthy individuals. Phase 1 trials enroll a small number of patients with diverse tumor types to study side effects and establish a safe dosage for a potential treatment, usually by increas - ing the dose serially and observing for side effects. Phase 1 studies also evaluate how a new treatment should be given (for example, if a new drug is best taken orally or injected into the bloodstream or muscle), how often it should be administered and the most effective dose with the fewest or least severe side effects. Most patients who enter phase 1 trials have limited treatment options or do not improve with standard therapies. This phase is not designed to determine the effectiveness of the treatment. Phase 2 trials continue to test the safety of a treatment while beginning to evaluate how well it work, sometimes in combinations with approved drugs. These trials are usually limited to a specific cancer that showed benefit with the treatment in earlier trials. Phase 3 trials compare the experimental drug, com - bination of drugs, regimen of radiation therapy or Understanding Clinical Trials What patients need to know to decide whether a clinical trial is right for them LEARN MORE!

UNDERSTANDING CLINICAL TRIALS 90 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONsurgical procedure with the current standard to determine if it is better. Enrollment is often in the hundreds to thou - sands across multiple locations. Typically, a participant is randomly assigned to the standard treatment or the new treatment (called randomization). Patients who are not randomized to the experimental treatment will receive identified standard treatments. Phase 4 trials are sometimes referred to as real-world studies, because they illustrate how a drug works outside of a strictly regulated clinical trial. Some, but not all, of these trials occur after a drug has been approved by the FDA. Some goals of phase 4 trials are to learn more about a drug's effectiveness, safety and side-effect profile. These trials also help determine how the medication works when given alongside other treatments, how it compares to other therapies on the market and whether or not it is cost-effective. Phase 4 investigations are large, including several hundreds or thousands of patients. COMPASSIONATE DRUG USE Compassionate drug use is the use of a new, unap - proved drug to treat a seriously ill patient when no other treatments are available. Many people with life-threatening diseases can't find suitable clinical trials. This might be because they live too far from cancer research centers where the studies are being done, or because they're not eligible for some reason.People who aren't in clinical trials might be able to get access to an unapproved drug from the company that makes it in two ways: 4\u0007Through expanded access programs (EAPs). 4 Through \"Right to Try\" laws. Expanded Access Programs (EAPs). In general, EAPs are for patients who meet all of these conditions: 4\u0007Have a serious and life-threatening condition. 4\u0007Are not eligible for any current clinical trial that's using the drug. 4\u0007Have no other comparable treatment options. 4\u0007Are likely to experience benefits that outweigh the risks involved. The FDA approves or denies EAP requests based on available reports from the company sponsoring the drug in clinical trials, including safety information and data about how the drug may treat cancer. To learn more, see the FDA 's information about EAPs at tinyurl.com/y9woscn3 . \"Right to Try. \" \"Right to try\" came about when a federal law was passed in 2018 that allows patients another path to access unapproved drugs, without needing the review and approval of the FDA. \"Right to try\" laws do not replace EAPs, but provide another way to possibly be able to access unapproved drugs. It's important to understand that \"right to try\" does not actually give patients the right to try any unapproved Before a drug can be approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use, it must pass a number of tests to prove its safety and effectiveness.

Instead, it gives them the right to request access to an unapproved drug from the company that makes it, without having to go through the FDA. Bypassing the FDA does not necessarily mean that such access will be granted. To be eligible for \"right to try,\" a person must: 4\u0007Have a diagnosis of a life-threatening disease or condition. 4\u0007Have tried all approved treatment options for the disease or condition. 4\u0007Be certified by a doctor to be unable to participate in a clinical trial for the investigational drug. 4\u0007Give written informed consent that he or she under - stands the risks of taking the investigational drug. 4\u0007Receive permission from the maker of the drug and approval from the institutional review board of a plan to administer and monitor effects from the drug. To learn more, see the FDA 's information about \"right to try\" at fda.gov/patients/learn-about-expanded- access-and-other-treatment-options/right-try . INFORMED CONSENT Before enrolling in a clinical trial, patients are asked to sign an informed consent document that states they understand the purpose of the research, its risks and ben - efits, the study procedures and their rights as patients. Patients should keep a copy of the informed consent document with their medical records. No informed con - sent document can ask patients to waive their legal rights or release the trial's research team, trial sponsor, drug manufacturer or institution from liability for negligence. Patients are allowed time to discuss the informed consent documents with family, friends or their physicians and to ask follow-up questions of the research team. As the trial progresses, the research team will continue to provide information and updates. It is important to understand that because the treatment is experimental, the outcomes and side effects are not always foreseeable, although any predicted risks should be explained in detail beforehand. COVERING THE COST Patients should discuss the costs associated with the trial with the research team and ask what would be covered by insurance. In most trials the therapy under investigation is provided at no cost to the participant. Routine costs, such as hospital stays, outpatient appointments and tests done during a trial, are often covered by insurance or Medicare if the trial meets certain criteria. A provision in the Affordable Care Act, effective in 2014, prohibits new health plans from denying coverage for routine care that the plan would otherwise provide just because a person with cancer is enrolled in a clini - cal trial. The law also prohibits insurers from dropping coverage because a person chooses to participate in a clinical trial. Patients considering a clinical trial might also want to calculate the cost of travel and lodging if the site of the trial is distant, especially if the trial extends over several weeks or months and frequent trips are needed. Some institutions and nonprofit organizations can help with certain expenses for travel and housing (visit curetoday.com/journey ). SEARCHING FOR A CLINICAL TRIAL No single resource lists every clinical trial, but ClinicalTrials.gov is the most comprehensive and allows searching by tumor type, drug type, location and other factors. The process might involve searching the web, calling pharmaceutical companies or asking a doctor or cancer center for information. Patient advocacy groups can also help patients find appropriate trials. Patients should begin with their oncologist who not only can tell them if something is available locally but also give them resources on what is happening in other parts of the country. Although it could be time-consuming to search for clinical trials at each location, patients will probably want to start with facilities closest to home. Those who are looking for a particular drug might want to contact the pharmaceu - tical company directly for the best information. Fewer trial locations will be available for drugs in early- phase testing, so patients might have better luck with late-phase trials, which are conducted in multiple sites across the country. Each trial has its own eligibility criteria and often has restrictions based on the type and stage of cancer age of the patients previous treatments received and current health status. Patients should have their medical histories accessible when searching for clinical trials because eligibility requirements could disqualify them from par - ticipating. Once they have found a number of trials for which they possibly qualify, patients should discuss them with their doctors and contact the study coordinators. 92 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONOIs a Clinical Trial Right for Me? ONCE PATIENTS ARE AWARE that clinical trials are an option for cancer treatment, many have ques - tions about whether this might be the right path for them. Blanca Ledezma of UCLA Health in Santa Monica, California, a nurse practitioner who holds a master's degree in nursing, has some insights that can help patients decide. Here, she answers some top patient questions about the pros and cons of joining trials. When and why should I consider joining a clinical trial? Patients should ask about clinical trials as soon as they receive their diagnosis and are mak - ing their first treatment decisions. They should always know what trials are available to them and whether they want to take part. Perhaps there aren't any trials that are appropriate for them, but at least they've asked and providers know they are interested. Some patients find it worthwhile to participate in trials because it means they will get a novel agent that could be more effective than standard care alone (Standard, or standard-of-care, treatment is approved by the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 the FDA \u2014 and widely recommended for use for patients with a particular condition). This may especially be of interest to patients with cancers for which there are few standard treatments or none that are very effective. Patients may also feel good knowing they are contributing to research that could help others in the future. How will I know if I'm eligible for a clinical trial? For a trial to be appropriate for an individual, that patient must meet its eligibility require - ments. These can include having a specific cancer or one that is associated with a certain genetic mutation, having cancer that is a certain stage, being within a specified age range, meet - ing a certain level of healthiness and ability to complete the daily activities of living, and having had or not had certain treatments in the past. What kinds of drugs would I take in a clinical trial? Trials can test targeted agents or immunotherapies, which are now available in numerous cancer types and are being tested in even more. They may also test chemotherapies, new classes of drugs, combi - nations of medications or medical devices. These types of drugs work in different ways. For instance: 4\u0007Chemotherapy affects cells that are rapidly growing and dividing; this includes cancer cells but also some healthy cells. 4\u0007Targeted drugs home in on cells affected by ARMMYPICCA / STOCK.ADOBE.COMA nurse discusses the pros and consPART 3: CHOOSING TREATMENT93 IS A CLINICAL TRIAL RIGHT FOR ME? a specific genetic mutation that drives cancer. Typically, they stop the activity of cancer-causing proteins that are made by the body due to such mutations. This means that targeted drugs mainly affect cancer cells. 4\u0007Immunotherapy stimulates the body's own immune system to fight cancer. Both targeted drugs and immunotherapies have changed the landscape quite significantly for certain disease types for which there wasn't much treatment to begin with. Now, we've been able to give patients more treatments, either alone or in combination with other therapies, that are personalized to their specific disease types, and they're doing better than they have in the past. Unfortunately, none of these drugs are free from side effects. Chemotherapy can cause fatigue, nau - sea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, mouth sores and low blood counts that can lead to infection. Targeted drugs can cause diarrhea, liver problems and rash and interfere with blood clotting and wound healing. Immunotherapies can cause fatigue, nausea, rash and, less often, problems in organs including the lungs, liver, kidneys, intestines and glands that make hormones.Why is molecular profiling important prior to a clinical trial? In standard treatment or clinical trials, molecular pro - filing of a patient's tumor is essential. Many targeted drugs and immunotherapies work by targeting a spe - cific genetic mutation and counteracting its cancer- causing activity. Generally, these drugs won't work well, or at all, unless the cancer has these mutations, so it wouldn't make sense to give them without first testing tumor tissue or cancer cells found in blood to determine which genetic alterations are present. In standard treatment, having this genetic informa - tion can help doctors decide which therapies to give and the order in which to administer them to maxi - mize the options available. When there are no FDA-approved treatments that target certain mutations, clinical trials of novel drugs can be especially helpful, although the efficacy of such medications can never be certain until these studies have been concluded. Because knowing all a tumor's treatable mutations is so crucial in terms of picking therapies, it's very important at diagnosis for patients to wait until all molecular test results have come back before choos - ing a course of treatment. ARMMYPICCA / STOCK.ADOBE.COM Patients should ask their oncologists about clinical trials, but also research on their own or with the help of patient advocacy groups.94 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONIf I join a trial, is it possible I will get a placebo instead of real medicine? In trials for patients with metastatic cancer, par - ticipants would never get just placebo but would always get some treatment \u2014 in many cases the current standard of care. Giving these patients nothing would be unethical. If it's a trial of an adjuvant drug (given after the pri - mary treatment) for earlier-stage disease, and it's not standard practice to give any therapy after the main treatment for a particular cancer, in that case there is a possibility that a treatment arm may consist of placebo alone. How can I know if a trial drug will work for me? Once patients are found to be eligible to take a drug, the only way to know if it is going to work is by trying it and that's true in standard-of-care ther - apy and in clinical trials. The difference is that we have data from studies of standard-of-care drugs and know, based on this data, that a treatment has been shown to have a certain efficacy for a par - ticular disease type. In a clinical trial, we're trying to develop (those) data so we can have more treat - ment options for patients. Like standard-of-care patients, those in studies are followed with scans to evaluate their response to treatment. How can I weigh the pros and cons of enrolling in a trial? Trials are something many patients are open to because they gain access to a new novel agent that is not otherwise available to them. They get the added benefit of being followed very closely. On the other hand, some patients may say, \"I'm working and trying to maintain normalcy, and that doesn't work for me,\" because being in a trial gener - ally requires a greater time commitment than get - ting standard treatment. We always have to consider the patient, their current situation, their desires and their current physical state. We inform patients that trials are voluntary and that we don't want to make them feel pressured to enter or stay in a trial. At the end of the day, they should do what they feel is the best decision for them. How can I learn about clinical trials that might be right for me? First, it's important that patients educate and empower themselves and really understand their disease and the available treatment options. Pro - viders will have a detailed discussion with patients regarding treatment options, including standard of care and possibly clinical trials. If patients have further questions regarding treatment options, they should contact their oncologists. Patient advocacy groups can be of benefit in providing information about available treatments, as long as they're reputable organizations such as the American Cancer Society, Cancer Care , Cancer Support Community and disease-specific groups including the American Lung Association, the Prostate Cancer Foundation, the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation and the Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation. Some patients may want to seek a second opinion to make sure they're aware of all their options. Clinical treatment guidelines written by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (nccn.org/patients/guidelines/cancers.aspx ) spe - cifically for patients can also be helpful in spelling out what standard treatment should consist of. Those who want to learn about clinical trial options can ask their doctors, nurse navigators or other members of their health care teams for sug - gestions about trials that may be appropriate for them. Some practices run trials and can enroll patients; others don't offer trials, but may refer patients to other institutions that do. To search on their own for trials, patients can go to ClinicalTrials.gov and search by disease type and/or drug type. Some patient advocacy groups have searchable online databases of clinical trials, and some offer navigators at no cost who can help patients find trials.

Many patients have private insurance through employee group plans or individual plans. It's essential for patients to become familiar with their individual insurance plans and their provi - sions to know what they will have to pay for themselves. This information can be found in the Sum - mary of Benefits and Coverage that can be obtained from the patient's insurance admin - istrator at work or from the company that sold the individual policy. Individual policies can be purchased in each state's insurance market - place without regard to preexisting conditions. Another option to consider is supplemen - tal insurance, which pays a fixed amount for each day a patient is hospitalized. There is usually a limit on the total number of hos - pital inpatient days covered in a calendar year. Supplemental policies are often used to pay for medical expenses not covered by the insurance plan or other expenses that might come up during an illness. However, they are really helpful only if patients already have health insurance coverage to cover the Handling Insurance Matters Strategies can help patients get the most out of their health care coverage Adapted with permission of the American Cancer Society LEARN MORE!

ADVICE FROM a SURVIVOR BONNIE ANNIS \"Don't be afraid to appeal a decision by your insurance company not to pay for something you feel you need. I did that when my insurance company deemed my lymphedema recirculation pump 'medically unnecessary. ' I felt it unfair to have to defend myself to the insurance company. As survivors, we've already had to fight in a battle we didn't choose. Breast cancer is a financial burden, and as a victim of this dreaded disease, I relied on insurance to cover the exorbitant costs. To be forced to fight for rights to medical equipment doesn't make sense.

If this occurs, it is important to have a working relationship with a case manager who can discuss the situation. First, patients should ask their doctors to write a letter explaining or justifying what has been done or requested. Patients then should resubmit the claim with a copy of the denial letter and the doc - tor's explanation. Sometimes the test or service will need to be coded differently. If challenging the denial in this way is not successful, then patients might need to: 4\u0007Postpone payment until the matter is resolved. 4\u0007Resubmit the claim and request a review. 4\u0007Ask to speak with a supervisor who has the authority to reverse a decision. 4\u0007Seek help from the consumer services divi - sion of the state insurance department or commission. 4\u0007Consider taking legal action.Patients should keep originals of correspond - ence. The cancer care team or doctor's office staff might help make copies if needed. Also, patients should keep a record of dates, names and conversations they have about the denial. FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNINSURED Patients who are uninsured may qualify for financial help to buy a health plan sold on their state's health insurance marketplace. If their income is below a certain level, they may be eligible for coverage through Medic - aid (eligibility varies by state). Some states have chosen to broaden access to Medicaid coverage under the health care law. Patients can search for plans at healthcare.gov from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15 each year, or outside that window if they have experienced a major life event such as job loss. Those who are uninsured can also talk to hospital social workers, who may be able to help find funding for treatment .

Surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, biologic and targeted therapies, radiation therapy \u2014 or any combination of these \u2014 can cause side effects that range from mild to severe, depending on the treatment and individual reactions. In the past, suffering from treatment side effects was an accepted part of the cancer experience, but today there are many ways to ease or even prevent most of them. NAUSEA AND VOMITING Treatment-related nausea and vomiting can develop at any time. The body releases the chemical serotonin in response to several types of chemotherapy. When serotonin binds to certain receptors in the brain, patients can experience nausea. Many anti-nausea drugs (antiemetics) work by blocking and shutting down these serotonin receptors. Chemotherapy can also cause nausea and vomiting by stimulating NK-1 receptors in the brain. NK-1 receptor inhibitors help prevent acute and delayed nausea and vomiting. Steroids are also used to prevent nausea. Side effects can include jitteriness, but the doses used typically do not cause the effects of long-term steroid use, such as swelling and immune suppression. A recent study showed that nausea and vomiting are no longer the side effects that cause the most concern for patients under - going chemotherapy, due to the effective PART 4: DURING TREATMENT SCAN THE QR CODE TO LEARN MORE!

Patients worry more about sleep loss and the effects of their illness on loved ones, the study showed. HAIR LOSS Because chemotherapy kills rapidly dividing cells, it can affect hair follicles, resulting in hair loss. The degree, pattern and timing of hair loss vary among patients, as do changes that occur during hair regrowth. Some drugs, particularly certain chemotherapies, can cause profound hair loss, whereas targeted agents that are aimed directly at cancer cells usually won't cause any. Patients should ask their doctors about what degree of hair loss to expect with treatment. It's normal for patients to feel distressed about losing their hair, which usually begins about two weeks after their first treatment. The scalp can become sensitive to washing, combing or brushing during the time when the hair is falling out. Facial hair, such as nasal hair, eyelashes and eyebrows, can also fall out, as well as hair on the arms, legs and pubic area. Patients who experience hair loss should do whatever feels comfortable, whether it's wearing scarves, caps, hairpieces or wigs, or simply leav - ing the head bare. If thinking about wearing a wig or a hairpiece, patients should buy it before treatment or at the start of treatment, so the wig shop can match their hair color and texture. Many cities have professional stylists who will cut a wig or hairpiece to a patient's preference. Patients should ask their doctors for a prescrip - tion for the wig because it might be covered by their health insurance. Hair should begin to grow back a few weeks after treatment ends. Those who are very upset by the prospect of losing their hair, or who want to keep their illness private by preserving their usual appearance, can consider using scalp cooling caps. Also known as scalp hypothermia or cold cap therapy, this technique involves cooling the scalp for a period of time before, during and after each chemotherapy treat - ment. This is thought to lessen the amount of drugs reaching the hair follicles, helping to prevent or reduce hair loss. The tech - nique seems to work best in patients whose chemotherapy regimens do not include an anthracycline, such as doxorubicin.

The Paxman Scalp Cooling System is approved to prevent hair loss in patients with solid tumors who are undergoing chemotherapy. Both can be purchased by hospitals, which can provide them to interested patients. DigniCap includes a cap attached to an automatic cooling system. It is becoming more widely available and its cost to each patient \u2014 $1,500 to $3,000 for the duration of chemotherapy \u2014 may be at least partially covered by insurance. Those interested can ask about availability at the facilities where they receive treatment. For approximately $450 per month, its web - site states, patients who have any kinds of solid tumors can rent Penguin Cold Caps and bring them to chemotherapy appointments. The cheapest option \u2014 a few hundred dollars \u2014 is to buy several Elasto-Gel caps online, a cooler or two and some dry ice, and have a friend come to infusion appointments to help change the caps every 30 minutes before, during and after treatment. Some experts worry that cooling the head during treatment leaves open the possibility that cancer will spread to the scalp, but other oncolo - gists say this is unlikely. Patients considering scalp cooling should confer with their doctors about whether it makes sense for them. LYMPHEDEMA Lymphedema is swelling that can occur due to a buildup of lymph fluid, a clear liquid that moves through the body carrying proteins, water, salts and white blood cells. Lymphedema can be caused by the removal of lymph nodes during cancer surgery, or by radiation, infection or the cancer itself. Where it occurs depends on the location of treatment. Lymphedema most often affects the arms or legs, but, alternatively, it could affect the face, abdo - men, neck or genitals.Lymphedema is treatable through techniques such as specialized massage or the use of com - pression garments to help keep it under control. It's a good idea to ask your medical team, before treatment, whether you are at risk, and what you \u2014 and they \u2014 can do to help prevent lymphedema. One method is to use presurgical or other techniques that guide doctors in removing as few crucial lymph nodes as possible. NEUROPATHY Patients taking mitotic inhibitors, such as taxa - nes and vinca alkaloids, platinum-containing agents or proteasome inhibitors, could develop neuropathy in the hands and feet. This nerve damage can develop weeks, months or years after treatment and typically involves the fingers and toes, or the entire hand and foot. Symptoms may resolve completely, although it can take a few weeks to many months or even a couple of years as the nerves slowly heal. Some drugs can cause permanent neuropathy, and in rare cases, can also injure the auditory nerves, causing hearing loss. Sensory neuropathy, the more common type, can cause pain, numbness, tingling or loss of sensation because it affects the nerves needed for touch, temperature and pain. Motor neuropathy results in a disruption of signals to the muscles and can lead to muscle weakness, clumsiness, balance problems and foot drop, a condition in which the front part of the foot is difficult to lift. Patients who develop neuropathy during chemotherapy should tell their doctors immedi - ately. There may be things that can be done to help keep it from worsening and prevent permanent damage. Neuropathy may be treated with anticonvulsants or antidepressants because of their effects on certain chemical signals. A compounding pharmacy can prepare a topi - cal cream that might reduce the severity of side effects. Also available topically is an anesthetic patch, which can be applied to intact skin in the ILLUSTRATION BY ERIN MOOREPART 4: DURING TREATMENT103 Radiation sometimes damages axons (long projections from nerve cells), as well as their protective sheath.Surgery can cause nerve damage or a buildup of scar tissue pressing on a nerve.

Chemotherapy can damage the axons, interfering with the transmission of nerve impulses.Surgical removal of lymph nodes can lead to lymphedema, a buildup of lymphatic fluid that sometimes puts painful pressure on nearby nerves.Cancer drug CANCER PAIN AT ITS SOURCE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PATIENTS experience cancer-related pain during or after treatment. Pain can be caused by cancer or its treatment but can often be relieved with an array of treatment strategies.COPING WITH SIDE EFFECTSILLUSTRATION BY ERIN MOORE104 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONarea with the most pain. In some cases, a change in the dose or type of anti-cancer drug might be necessary. CANCER PAIN Management strategies are available for patients who experience cancer-related pain during and after treatment. Many cancer centers have pain and palliative care specialists. With the help of a doctor or pain specialist, patients can develop a personal pain management plan that might include relief strategies for long-term (chronic) and short-term (acute) pain, as well as brief, severe flare-ups called breakthrough pain. Patients with cancer who experience pain might need around-the-clock medication to prevent the pain rather than waiting to relieve it once it occurs. Long-acting medications continuously given or metabolized slowly in the body may be best for cancer-related chronic pain and can be combined with short-acting medication for acute and break - through pain. Although morphine is not used for all types of pain, and has side effects that can include consti - pation, drowsiness, itchiness, urinary retention and nausea, it may be the best choice for patients with cancer pain. Medications are also available to relieve symptoms caused by opioids. Because constipation is a common side effect of opioids, stool softeners and laxatives should be taken regularly. It might take time to reach a balance of pain relief and manageable side effects by gradu - ally adjusting doses or trying different opioids. Many side effects improve once the body adjusts to the medication. Pain relief patches that are applied to the skin for continuous release of medication over sev - eral days might be more convenient than oral medication, especially if patients have trouble swallowing. For example, narcotic patches can deliver opioids continuously through the skin for up to 72 hours. Some versions of the pain patch include a potent semisynthetic opioid that has milder side effects. Narcotics are also used for breakthrough pain and may be avail - able in various formulations: as a lozenge, an effervescent tablet that is held between the cheek and gum, a mouth spray, a nasal spray and a dissolvable film placed on the inner cheek. For some less-common situations, pain specialists could use nerve blocks or drugs delivered to the spinal fluid. Patients who are worried about becoming addicted or have other concerns about taking pain medication should talk to their doctors or a pain specialist. Although the fear of addiction is common, very few patients become addicted to pain medication when it is taken properly. If patients have trouble getting the pain control they need, they should work with their treatment teams to get relief that works. In complicated cases where pain control is difficult to achieve, a pain specialist might be needed. There have been few studies within the United States exploring the potential medical benefits of marijuana, or cannabis. The prescription, pos - session or sale of the substance is legal in some states but not in others. Where cannabis is legal for medical use, each state may have its own rules about which patients are eligible. A study whose results were published recently showed that one-quarter of patients with cancer who responded to a survey about marijuana reported using the substance to quell pain, nau - sea, stress or depression about their illness, or to stimulate appetite. The patients surveyed lived in a state in which medical marijuana was legal. If you are considering using marijuana to ease side effects of your cancer or its treatments, speak confidentially with your doctor about the pros and cons, so that you can make an informed decision. ANEMIA Patients whose levels of red blood cells (RBCs) drop significantly can develop fatigue, shortness PART 4: DURING TREATMENT105 of breath, heart palpitations and disorientation \u2014 all symptoms of anemia. RBCs are made from stem cells in the bone marrow and carry oxygen to the body's tissues. Certain cancers, such as leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma, crowd out or suppress the production of healthy RBCs. Chemotherapy and radiation can damage the stem cells that make RBCs. In some patients, low levels of RBCs or low hemoglobin levels \u2014 a measure of the ability of RBCs to carry oxygen \u2014 can be treated with genetically engineered erythropoietin (EPO), a protein produced normally in the kidneys. Cer - tain drugs that act like natural EPO decrease the likelihood of a transfusion, but patients could still need one if their RBC levels dip dangerously low. Because of serious side effects, the Food and Drug Administration does not recommend these drugs for treating anemia in patients who are not receiving chemotherapy or for those receiving chemotherapy as a curative treatment. It's also recommended that they only be used with a goal of avoiding transfusions or severe anemia, rather than to try to get RBCs to a normal level. NEUTROPENIA Neutropenia, a shortage of the white blood cells called neutrophils, can make patients prone to infec - tion, which may cause fever, fatigue and body aches. Fast-growing neutrophils are quickly killed off by chemotherapy and radiation. Neutropenia can result Neutrophil3 21STIMULATING GROWTH FACTORSNEUTROPENIACOPING WITH SIDE EFFECTS Some therapies work by binding to receptors in certain cells, directing them to become infection- fighting white blood cells, such as neutrophils.

Drugs that activate granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (particles in the body that signal white blood cells to grow) are effective at reducing neutropenia, but they can produce a side effect of bone pain. Patients who develop neutropenia are advised to take special precautions to prevent infection until their white blood cell counts improve, includ - ing frequent hand washing, avoiding people who are sick and not eating raw fruits and vegetables. Patients who develop fever or display signs of infection during chemotherapy should notify their doctors immediately. FATIGUE Most patients experience mild to severe fatigue at some point during treatment. Fatigue caused by anemia and low thyroid function can be treated. When those causes are ruled out, the patient's medical team will look for other approaches. Fatigue can worsen if patients have pain, are distressed or have sleep problems. Exercise, such as walking, has been found to improve fatigue. IMMUNE-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS Immunotherapies, particularly those known as checkpoint inhibitors, hold a lot of promise as treatments for a variety of cancers. While these drugs are generally known for being easier to toler - ate than chemotherapies, they are associated with a unique array of side effects. These reactions arise from inflammation caused by the stepped-up immune system harming some normal tissue. Immune-related side effects can include fatigue, headache, weakness, diarrhea, abdomi - nal pain, constipation, skin rashes, itchiness, shortness of breath, cough, low blood pressure, high blood pressure, joint pain, hepatitis, inflam - mation of the liver, or hormonal problems such as an overactive or underactive thyroid or under - active pituitary gland.These are most often treated with steroids, in some cases combined with temporary or perma - nent interruption of the immunotherapy. Imodium (loperamide) can treat milder diarrhea. Hormonal imbalances caused by immunother - apy may end up being permanent, meaning that those affected will need to take hormone supple - ments indefinitely. A more severe autoimmune reaction, which may occur in people who take CAR-T cell therapies, is called cytokine release syndrome, and arises from the immune system attacking healthy organs while it attacks cancer cells. This can cause side effects including serious heart and breathing problems, as well as brain issues such as confusion or the inability to under - stand speech. Steroids can be used to treat cytokine release syndrome induced by CAR-T cell therapy, and approved to treat severe cases is Actemra (tocili - zumab), a monoclonal antibody that suppresses the immune system. Sometimes, immunotherapy needs to be delayed or stopped because of side effects. Patients may worry about having to stop treat - ment, but they should be open with their care teams about side effects as soon as they occur. This can help doctors and others on the team to control side effects before they become severe. OTHER SIDE EFFECTS All patients undergoing treatment are unique \u2014 as are the side effects they experience. Additional possible side effects include rash, cognitive dys - function (also called chemo brain), mouth sores (oral mucositis), diarrhea, insomnia and low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia). Patients should ask their doctors about solu - tions for side effects they believe are associated with treatment \u2014 both physical and psycholog - ical. Also, they should ask for a name and phone number of a person to contact after hours should they experience these side effects. ZINKEVYCH / STOCK.ADOBE.COMPART 4: DURING TREATMENT107 Supportive Care Improves Quality of Life PATIENTS EXPERIENCING SIDE EFFECTS before, during or after treatment for cancer should ask their medical teams for supportive care, also known as palliative care. This kind of care is for anyone at any stage of the cancer journey whose quality of life has been low - ered by physical or emotional side effects of the disease or its treatment. The goal of supportive care, which is given separately from medical, surgical and radiotherapy treatments, is to make patients more comfortable. It can be provided by physicians, nurse practitioners/physician assistants, counselors, psy - chologists, physical therapists, nutritionists, acupunc - turists, massage therapists, artists and others focused on a holistic approach to managing symp - toms. In some cases, this care can improve patients' health outcomes. Supportive care includes the following: 4 Medication for pain. 4 Physical therapy to build strength or address debilitation from the disease or its treatments. 4 Talking with a counselor or psychologist about emotional distress.4 Meeting with a hospital chaplain to discuss spiritual distress. 4 Consulting a nutritionist or dietitian regarding significant changes in weight related to cancer or its treatments. 4 Integrative medicine techniques, such as acu - puncture, oncologic massage, tai chi, qi gong, yoga, meditation, cooking, art therapy and music therapy. 4 Advance care planning, such as writing a living will and designating a medical power of attorney to make decisions, if ever needed. The American Society of Clinical Oncology recom - mends supportive care for all patients with advanced cancer, but this care is voluntary, and patients can choose which services they want and which they don't. Patients should ask their care teams early on for supportive care. If the hospital does not provide it, patients can ask for referrals. For the vast majority of patients, health insurance covers supportive care visits, although some integrative therapies, such as acupuncture, may not be covered. ZINKEVYCH / STOCK.ADOBE.COMCOPING WITH SIDE EFFECTS MANAGING DISCOMFORT 108 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONFFOR MOST PATIENTS, the actual treatment for cancer will be short-lived. Generally, the longer the cancer experience \u2014 from the first suspicious symptom to the final treatment appointment \u2014 the longer the time needed to recover from the physical and emotional ripple effects. The post-treatment picture can vary sub - stantially, depending on the type of cancer and treatment, and the long-term prognosis. For example, some cancer types might require ongoing treatment or follow-up surgery, such as reconstructive procedures, leaving the patient cancer-free, but not free of cancer's effects. Some patients have lingering physical and emotional effects that began during treatment and continue afterward. Called long-term effects, these can include pain, neuropathy (nerve damage), lymphedema (swelling of the extremities), anxiety, sleep disturbances, cogni - tive dysfunction and fatigue. Others might have issues related to cancer or its treatment that emerge months or years after treatment has ended. These so-called late effects include such issues as secondary cancers, infertility and heart, bone or lung problems.

NEW AFRICA / STOCK.ADOBE.COMPART 4: DURING TREATMENT 109 years. Research into late effects experienced by adult survivors is complicated by the fact that as people age, they develop other medical prob - lems, or comorbidities, making it more difficult to determine if the problems are related to prior cancer treatment, aging or an interaction between the two. Examples of late effects are that one class of medications, known as anthracyclines, as well as the drug Herceptin (trastuzumab) for HER2-posi - tive breast cancer, can cause damage to the heart. These are some other problems that can occur: 4 High blood pressure caused by drugs that target the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). 4 Lung damage from chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy to the chest. 4 Osteoporosis or joint pain due to chemother - apy, steroids or hormonal therapy. 4 Brain, spinal cord and nerve damage manifest - ing as hearing loss or increased risk of stroke, due to chemotherapy or radiation. 4 Dental problems due to chemotherapy, bone- protective drugs or radiation. 4 Vision problems due to steroids or some targeted therapies. 4 Digestive disturbances due to chemotherapy, radiation or surgery. 4 Lymphedema, a pooling of liquid in limbs or other body parts due to surgery or radiation to the lymph nodes 4 Peripheral neuropathy, nerve damage in the hands and feet from chemotherapy, which can cause numbness, weakness or pain The damage is usually dose-dependent: The more of a drug a patient has, the more likely he or she will have a problem. Radiation presents another heart risk, since beams aimed at the chest to fight lymphoma, breast or other cancers can also reach the heart and lungs. Radiation can weaken or scar the heart muscle or damage its valves. It also can accelerate coronary artery disease, creating rough spots in the lining of the arteries where fatty plaque can accumulate. MENTAL CHANGES Foggy, unfocused thinking before, during or after chemotherapy, sometimes lasting months or years, is often referred to as \"chemo brain.\" Chemo brain can involve trouble with memory, focus, details, common words and multitask - ing. High doses of chemotherapy are particularly associated with the problem, although other risk factors include lack of sleep, depression, anxiety, stress, medications, pain and its treatments, older age and other health conditions. Treatments for chemo brain can include psychostimulant medications and memory and attention training. Other ways to help counteract chemo brain include keeping a daily planner, doing word NEW AFRICA / STOCK.ADOBE.COMUNDERSTANDING & MANAGING LONG-TERM & LATE EFFECTS110 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONpuzzles, getting enough sleep, getting physical exercise, eating vegetables, following routines and avoiding multitasking. Accepting your new normal and explaining it to friends and relatives can help, too. SEXUAL SIDE EFFECTS Some cancers and their treatments can have a significant effect on both sexuality and fertility, and knowing about these possibilities in advance can help patients and their doctors prepare for and choose therapies. In addition to fear and worry, treatments can interfere with sexual activity. Patients may feel nauseated or fatigued from treatment, or may have physical problems or pain that interferes with sex due to treatment or its effects on hormones. They also may feel sensitive about changes in their bod - ies caused by surgery or other treatment. Communication with your partner and choosing alternative forms of closeness can be important in supporting a sexual relationship in the face of these challenges. In men, some treatments may cause erection or ejaculation problems. Some men experiencing these effects may benefit from supplements, medi - cations or other treatments recommended by their doctors. Before getting therapy for cancer, men should talk to their doctors about the treatment's anticipated effects on their fertility, and ask if they should consider preserving sperm if they want to father children after treatment. For women, surgery and other treatments can affect physical appearance and sexual function. For example, hormonal changes may cause men - strual cycles to decrease or stop, and this can result in vaginal dryness and pain during sexual activity. Lubricants and other treatments or procedures should be discussed as options for these problems. Because some treatments can cause problems with fertility, women who may want to have chil - dren after treatment should talk to their doctors about options for preserving their eggs. (See Page 36 for details.) SECONDARY CANCERS If cancer returns, it is considered a recurrence of the primary cancer. When a survivor receives a diagnosis of a new primary, it might not be con - nected to treatment for the first diagnosis, or it might be a secondary cancer \u2014 one caused (or whose risk could have been increased) by treat - ment for the initial cancer. A second cancer can occur for a variety of rea - sons, most unrelated to past cancer treatment. For example, it is well known that breast cancer sur - vivors with BRCA mutations are at higher risk for ovarian and other cancers, and current or former smokers who have survived other cancers have an increased risk of lung cancer. Researchers know that many patients who received a secondary cancer diagnosis experienced high doses of radiation to certain areas of the body or particular types of chemotherapy. For example, radiation is known to be a risk factor for breast cancer in women who had radiation to the chest area. Researchers have also concluded that some late effects tend to occur within a specific time period. For example, leukemia and other blood cancers caused by some chemotherapy drugs tend to develop within several years of treatment. By contrast, the risk of developing a new solid tumor continues to increase even 10 years after therapy. Some survivors of breast cancer who under - went mastectomy and then reconstruction using textured breast implants have developed a blood cancer called breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). A specific prod - uct line associated with this condition has been recalled, but patients planning reconstruction should receive a written warning from their plastic surgeons spelling out the risks associated with implants, and should confirm that these doctors are familiar with BIA-ALCL and how to treat it.

MAINTAINING A HEAL THY DIET is important during treatment. Patients might think load - ing up on vitamins instead will help fight the cancer or reduce some negative side effects of treatment. Unfortunately, certain dietary supplements do more harm than good, as some can actually interfere with drugs used for cancer treatment. In fact, many oncologists discourage patients from using any supplements during treatment. Therefore, patients who are trying to balance their nutritional needs during treatment should consult their doctors before using dietary supplements.LOSING OR GAINING WEIGHT Weight loss or gain is a common side effect, depending on the cancer type or its treatment. Fatigue and decreased physi - cal activity can also contribute. Increasing consumption of vegetables and fresh fruits can help patients to cope with weight fluc - tuations. With approval from their doctors, patients can exercise to help with fatigue, weight maintenance, anxiety and mobility. Some gyms and cancer centers have pro - grams designed for patients with cancer, and many oncology practices have a dietitian with oncology experience on staff.Getting Proper Nutrition Maintaining a healthy diet, including proper hydration, is important 112 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONA HEAL THFUL DIET During cancer treatment, you might need to change your diet to help keep up your strength and cope with side effects that can make it difficult for you to meet your nutritional needs. Your health care team can refer you to a dietitian who can help individualize your eating plan based on your specific needs. Having frequent small meals might make eating easier if you don't feel well, and can help keep your energy up. Those who are finding it difficult to toler - ate nutritious foods should eat whatever is most appealing to them. Special diets can be helpful for people with specific cancers, or who are undergo - ing certain treatments; ask your care team to advise you. Finally, take care to avoid fad diets and eating plans you might learn about from friends or on the internet, especially any promoted by those with money- making interests. Talk to your health care team about the best eating plan for you during treatment. STAYING HYDRATED Water is the most important substance in a patient's diet. Dehydration occurs when the body takes in less fluid than it releases. It happens quickly when a patient has diar - rhea, vomiting or fever with sweating. Patients might not have the desire or energy to eat or drink, so when they do feel thirsty, they are probably already dehydrated. Symptoms include little or dark-colored urine, fatigue, sunken eyes and skin that remains raised if pinched (called decreased or poor skin turgor). Signs of severe dehydration, such as low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, dizziness and confusion, could require immediate intravenous fluids. Proper hydration can help ease com - mon side effects, such as constipation and fatigue, as well as rare but serious ones, such as kidney damage. Because the kidneys filter waste, chemicals and excess compounds from the blood, intravenous fluids are given during some types of treatment, and patients might be told to drink water before and after therapy to flush toxins through the kidneys and bladder quickly. Patients with compromised immune sys - tems can stay hydrated by drinking water. Tap water may be OK if it is from a munici - pal water supply. If water is from a private well, it is best for patients with cancer to have it tested and, if contaminants are found, to install a filter that removes those specific pollutants. If it comes from other sources, patients should boil and cool their water before drinking it, use distilled water or choose bottled brands that specify on their labels that it was cleaned using reverse osmosis. Sometimes it's hard to take in enough water to help avoid dehydration. Other ways to get fluids include broth, sports drinks, juice, gelatin, ice chips and Popsicles. Patients should talk with their cancer teams if they have concerns. Good hydration is one way patients can stay as healthy as possible and feel better during and after treatment. PART 4: DURING TREATMENT113 GETTING PROPER NUTRITION NUTRITION TIPS Eating Well During Therapy GOOD NUTRITION CAN BE A STRONG ALLY during cancer treatment. Below are tips patients should consider. WEIGHT MANAGEMENT 4 Eat nutrient-dense foods first so as not to get full too quickly on other things. 4 Keep indulgent foods on hand for when absolutely nothing else will do. 4 Add powdered milk to liquid milk. Sprinkle grated cheese in soups and on vegetables. LACK OF ENERGY 4 Ask for help with food shopping and meal preparation. 4 Eat off disposable plates and use plastic utensils to reduce clean-up time. 4 Try finger foods. Cheese, avocado sand - wiches, and bananas with peanut butter can be quick and satisfying. NAUSEA 4 Take anti-nausea medication as directed. 4 Cold foods are often better tolerated. 4 Make sure food preparation areas are properly ventilated. Some odors can worsen nausea. MOUTH SORES 4 Choose soft textures and moisten solid foods with sauces or gravies. 4 Stay away from acidic, spicy and salty items, as well as tobacco and alcohol, as they can irritate mouth sores. 4 Take pain medication before meals or as prescribed.

NEW AFRICA / STOCK.ADOBE.COM114 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONMMANY PATIENTS WONDER if they can \u2014 or should \u2014 exercise during cancer treatment. In a recent report by the American Cancer Society, a group of experts in nutrition, physical activity and cancer survivorship evaluated the scien - tific evidence and concluded that exercise is not only safe during cancer treatment, but also can improve quality of life in many ways. An American College of Sports Medicine roundta - ble on exercise guidelines for cancer survivors also concluded that exercise during cancer treatment is safe and can improve physical functioning, quality of life and cancer-related fatigue. In fact, for those living disease-free or with stable disease, physical activity might even help prolong life. The bottom line: Avoid inactivity. Experts say any kind of activity helps. Studies show a signifi - cant benefit from simply walking three to five hours a week at an average pace. Walking is easy, cost-free and can be done just about any time, anywhere. Patients should use good judgment when beginning or continuing to exercise, make sure to warm up and stretch, and always discuss their plans with their doctors before starting. MENTAL BENEFITS Some of the most important benefits of activ - ity can be psychological. Being active offers a sense of self-control and helps with body image, self-esteem, anxiety and depression during treatment. Because exercise boosts endorphins, it's recommended for healthy people who have mild to moderate depression and is known to decrease mild depression. It has the same effect in those undergoing cancer treatment. PHYSICAL BENEFITS Exercise conveys a range of physical benefits, too. It helps combat fatigue, control weight gain Staying Active Exercising during cancer treatment can give patients a boost LEARN MORE!

Other side effects of treatment that could be favorably influenced by exercise include nausea, deconditioning of the heart and lungs and loss of muscle mass and bone strength. Studies show that exercise could help reduce the overall risk for breast, colon and other types of cancer, too. To learn more about how exercise can help, visit the American Cancer Society's website at cancer.org/ healthy/eat-healthy-get-active.html .OVERCOMING BARRIERS While there are plenty of reasons to exercise, some patients might need guidance and motivation in the beginning if exercising is new. One challenge is learning how to deal with treatment-related physical limitations. Talk to your care team about physical fitness pro - grams that will fit in best with your overall treatment plan . PREPARING TO EXERCISE What to Know Before Beginning an Exercise Program NEARLY EVERYONE CAN DO some type of activity. But it's important that patients keep in mind a few general precautions before exercising during cancer treatment. Patie nts who were already active might have to slow down a bit during treatment and perhaps not exercise as intensely as before. They should assess how they feel and avoid pushing themselves. It's important for patients to communicate with their health care providers about their planned physical activities. People who were sedentary before diagnosis should start exercising slowly, adding more intensity and frequency as they are able. Patients should consider how active they were before treatment and adjust accordingly. Side effects of treatment can determine the most appropriate type of exercise. For example, someone with neuropathy could have numb toes, which would make riding a stationary bike a better choice than walking on a treadmill. Patients expe - riencing lymphedema have long been discouraged from upper body strength training or vigorous activity, but a number of clinical trials have shown that not only are these activities safe for these individuals, they might actually reduce the incidence and sever - ity of lymphedema. Patients must talk to their doctors to determine what is safe. Patients who are undergoing frequent chemotherapy treat - ments could have lower immune function and should avoid work - ing out in public places, such as gyms. People who are having skin reactions from radiation treatments and those with open wounds or catheters should avoid swimming. An upper body port placement might necessitate temporarily avoiding upper body strength training. Patients with advanced disease who experience limitations due to bone metastases should discuss exercise with their health care providers and gener - ally use pain or discomfort as a guide for what type of activity to avoid. STAYING ACTIVEHALFPOINT / STOCK.ADOBE.COM116 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONAA DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER affects more than patients' health \u2014 it also affects their money. For patients coping with cancer, simultaneously dealing with financial issues, and possibly debt, can be difficult and draining. Cancer Support Community, which can be found at CancerSupportCommunity.org/cost , can help patients make educated, shared decisions with their health care professionals about which treatments to choose. In a meeting with Cancer Support Community experts, patients can explore that issue via the Open to Options \u00ae treatment decision model ( CancerSupportCommunity.org/ make-treatment-decision-right-you ). Through this process, they can identify their goals in seeking therapy and consider treatment benefits in relation to their goals and concerns such as side effects and cost of care.Such meetings are free and can take place over the phone or in person; to set up an appointment, call the organization's help line at 888-793-9355. Once treatment decisions have been made, there are ways to lessen the financial burden. Ask friends and loved ones for help. Have someone open and organize bills into catego - ries, such as medical, household, credit card statements, taxes and so on. Also, they can look for any benefit checks and help get them depos - ited quickl y. Rank the bills in order of priority. For most people, health insurance premiums, food, medicines and utilities will be near the top of the lis t.Managing Financial Matters Organization and help are crucial in handling finances during treatment Find organizations that can offer you financial assistance. Visit the resources section of our Cancer Guide at curetoday.com/journey .PART 4: DURING TREATMENT 117 Negotiate for smaller payments. Often, creditors will work with patients. Most creditors prefer that people in debt make small payments rather than pay noth - ing at all. Work out a payment plan. Organizations such as Clearpoint Credit Counseling Solutions (800-750- 2227), which offers most counseling and education services for free, can help patients negotiate a pay - ment plan to satisfy their creditors. Talk with an oncology social worker. These specialists can help with financial issues and might be able to point out sources of financial aid. Ask the hospital about financial counseling. Some hospitals offer free financial counseling to patients. Consider crowdfunding. Companies such as GoFundMe and others will do most of the work for you when it comes to raising funds online to help with your medical or everyday expenses. Some of these companies will keep a small percentage of donated funds as payment for their service. Look for organizations that might offer you financial assistance. These can include nonprofit organizations and pharmaceutical companies. For a listing of groups that may be able to help, visit curetoday.com/journey . MAKE A FINANCIAL PLAN A sound plan means always preparing for the worst while hoping it never happens. When patients are going into treatment, it's good to plan for: 4 The highest out-of-pocket medical expenses. 4 Travel costs. 4 The greatest number of hospital stays. 4 High prescription drug costs. 4 Experimental therapy not covered by insurance.4 Home health care costs. 4 A disruption in work schedule. 4 Home services, such as cooking or cleaning. Some of these costs can be difficult to estimate. Patients might want to discuss them with their doc - tors so they can plan accurately. TO START A FINANCIAL PLAN, PATIENTS SHOULD TAKE FOUR STEPS 1. Estimate their expenses. 2. Identify sources of income and benefits. 3. Manage their savings and investments. 4. Plan their estates. Tackling financial issues can be a challenge for anyone. Cancer treatments sometimes leave patients little energy to think about money matters. If it's more difficult to address some topics than others, they should take on the easier ones first. Being in treatment can mean added expenses that might be high. At the same time, patients' incomes can go down if their work hours are reduced or they are unable to work. Patients should make budgets using numbers that are based on the maximum out-of-pocket expenses for their existing health care plans, plus something for charges above and beyond the cov - ered expenses. STAS_MALYAREVSKY / STOCK.ADOBE.COMMANAGING FINANCIAL MATTERS118 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONWWHAT HAS COME TO be known as financial toxic - ity is considered a side effect of cancer treatment in America. Patients can wind up in debt or even bankrupt due to the costs of treatment, hospital stays and follow-up testing, which may continue to add up over a long period. To make matters worse, doctors often don't broach this subject with their patients. That's why it's important that patients ask their doctors about the costs of the treatments offered and any cheaper alternatives. If expensive thera - py is necessary but difficult to afford, patients do have organizations they can turn to for help. NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS By providing either guidance or direct funding, many nonprofit organizations and government agencies help patients navigate the economic pitfalls of cancer care. A good place to start: the American Cancer Society, which has a website section dedicated to information about financial programs and resources. The organization also suggests ways to afford prescriptions and handle hard-to-pay medical bills. To learn more, call 800-227-2345 or visit cancer.org/treatment/finding-and-pay - ing-for-treatment.html . The National Cancer Institute maintains an alphabetical list of more than 100 organiza - tions that may be able to offer financial support. Searches can also be done by cancer type or type of assistance needed.

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES Drugmakers can sometimes step in when medica - tion price tags present a challenge. Pharmaceutical companies operate hundreds of programs that pro - vide financial help in the form of free or discounted medication and, together, help a surprisingly large percentage of patients. Often, these programs aim to help those who are uninsured or underinsured. Most programs also have income eligibility limits, but these may be set quite high, so even patients who are financially well-off may be eligible. Patients can apply through the mail, via fax or online, and sometimes doctors' offices will help. Pharmaceutical companies also offer copay assistance programs that discount the price of their drugs and are open to people who have health insurance. Although many copay programs are not available to those on Medicare, it's worth checking with drugmakers to find out for sure. FINANCIAL LIFELINES120 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONSome pharmaceutical companies even offer counselors who guide patients in finding other sources of financial help. Counselors also can assist patients in appealing insurance company decisions to not pay for care. To find a pharmaceutical program, go to the website of the company that makes your drug and search for patient assistance programs, or call the company. Another option: Visit the website of the Partnership for Prescription Assistance (medicineassistancetool.org), run by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, to access a search - able database of most of these programs. Visit curetoday.com/journey , for a list of resources. CONSERVING FUNDS Making informed decisions about care with both cost and effectiveness in mind can also help patients avoid debt. Ask yourself and your care team if a treatment is warranted and if there is a similarly effective but more affordable alternative. It's also important to consider whether options are supported by scien - tific evidence and expert recommendations. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network issues clinical guidelines that spell out what treatments are called for in different types and stages of can - cer ( nccn.org/patients/guidelines/cancers.aspx ). In addition, tests and procedures that duplicate recent care \u2014 and associated costs \u2014 might not be necessary. The American Society of Clinical Oncology has a Choosing Wisely campaign to guide patients in making cost/benefit decisions about treatment. A list of treatments and practices that patients and their doctors should question or avoid can be found here: choosingwisely.org/societies/ american-society-of-clinical-oncology . H_KO / STOCK.ADOBE.COMASSISTANCE PROGRAMS Help for Patients THE COSTS OF CANCER TREATMENT can become overwhelming, even for patients who have medical insurance. Patient assistance programs are offered by various companies, nonprofit organizations and gov - ernment agencies to help patients with little or no insurance get access to drugs and money for other treatment-related expenses. A patient interested in enrolling in an assistance program must first gather infor - mation, usually from the doctor or care team. In most cases, the patient will need to fill out an application from the drug manufac - turer. A doctor must be involved in the process because the physician writes the prescription for the medication. Many patient assistance applications will require proof of income, including tax returns, Social Security income, interest and retirement income, to prove financial burden and meet income requirements. In addition to many state governments, numerous organizations provide information on patient assistance programs. For listings, visit curetoday.com/journey . PART 4: DURING TREATMENT 5Handling Fear of Recurrence . 122 Developing a Survivorship Care Plan . 124 For related articles, visit curetoday.comPART FIVE After Treatment122 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONPPATIENTS UNDERGOING TREATMENT often worry about whether therapy will cure their disease. But a different kind of worry \u2014 fear of the cancer returning \u2014 often emerges at the completion of therapy when the medical team is no longer present. Although fear of recurrence might never go away, it should diminish over time, especially if a patient has a positive experience living as a survivor and a well person. Managing fear is essential when external stimuli, known as triggers, feed anxiety. Some common triggers include a relative or friend receiving a cancer diagnosis, aches and pains previously associ - ated with cancer, media coverage of cancer and follow-up medical appointments. Having to revisit those emotions during medical appoint - ments can sometimes lead survivors to avoid necessary follow-up testing. For others, fear becomes part of an action plan, motivating survivors to seriously look at maintaining a proper diet and healthy lifestyle. Helpful coping strategies include using calming self-statements, imagery and dis - traction; talking to family, friends, doctors or nurses about the fear; or writing in a journal, which provides a setting for a personal mono - logue to explore issues behind the fear and ways to overcome it. Other tips follow. Acknowledge the fear, anger or sadness. Survivors should accept that sometimes they will worry about cancer returning, and the best thing to do is acknowledge their feelings and talk with someone who will listen and not judge. Live life to the fullest. Around the time of a check-up, survivors should pursue activities that provide a distraction so they have some - thing else to focus on.Handling Fear of Recurrence The uncertainty that cancer might return can be managed LEARN MORE!

Survivors should find an exercise they enjoy that will take their mind off fear. Exercise can also help reduce stress. Learn the actual signs of recurrence. Being informed about the potential warning signs of recurrence and the potential risk of it can help ease concerns. Get a check-up. If fear of recurrence is over - whelming, survivors should talk with their doctors about blood work or other tests that could alleviate their fears. Sometimes people become so fearful that they fall into despair. Symptoms of fear that can indicate a need for mental health care include excessive anger and irritability, difficulty with concentration and problem solving, and physical symptoms, such as muscle tension, dry mouth, trembling, shak - ing or restlessness. Changes in appetite or sleep can also be important symptoms that indicate a need for help. Some people find that medica - tion is appropriate in helping them get through the most stressful periods. RAJABI ILLUSTRATION BY RAY PELESKOHANDLING FEAR OF RECURRENCE ADVICE FROM a SURVIVOR SAMIRA RAJABI \"The thing about being in constant fear of recurrence is that it is remarkably hard to stop paying attention. Recovery brought with it a fear of being well, a fear that, if I returned to my life, the way I wanted to live it, that one day it would all collapse out from under me. I was afraid to get better at the risk my symptoms would reoccur. Every time I feel a drip out of my nose, a surge of a headache, the ringing in my ears, I must remind myself that it doesn't necessarily mean I am sick again. I also must remind myself, as my mother once did, that even if it did mean I would be sick again, with hope, with a continued devotion to my life and those I love, everything would be OK. \" FUTURE RISK DOCTORS CAN'T PRECISELY PREDICT if cancer will recur, but depending on the type, stage and other factors, a strategy to monitor for recurrence can be put in place when treatment ends. Typically, patients who had complete surgical removal of their tumor or those with early-stage, nonaggressive tumors are less likely to have a recurrence. For most cancers, the risk of recurrence declines over time, but every cancer type has a different pattern.Patients should establish a regular schedule of follow-up visits with doc - tors and have an idea of the kind of testing that should be done to check for recurrence. This might include blood tests or imaging. A newer and more sensitive technique for finding a very small number of lingering cancer cells, and thus detecting a recurrence early or even preventing it, is liquid biopsy. These tests check the blood for traces of DNA shed by tumors. In clinical trials, the tests can find DNA that would otherwise be undetectable. Liquid biopsies are not widely used yet, but are a promising strategy in a number of cancer types, including breast. After treatment for cancer, adjuvant (postsurgical) therapy with drugs or radia - tion can help some patients lower their risk of recurrence. In addition, frequent exercise and a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables could help lower recurrence risk in many cancers.Predicting Recurrence SCAN THE QR CODE to read SAMIRA 'S story.124 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONMMANY PATIENTS are overwhelmed when they learn they have cancer, and studies show it's difficult for them to absorb information about their diagnosis. Then, as they focus on getting through treatment, they might not think to ask their health care teams about life beyond cancer. The time after initial treatment ends has become recognized as its own, distinct phase of the cancer experience, and those who study cancer survivors have suggested a strategy for the ongoing clinical care of can - cer survivors. At the heart of this strategy is a survivorship care plan (SCP), a document that includes details not only about the patient's diagnosis and treatment, but also essential information needed for long-term follow-up care. The SCP should officially switch a patient to a general physician who will provide primary care and routine disease screenings. Designed for discussion at the end of treat - ment, the SCP should include summaries of key diagnostic and staging results, treatments and dosages received and the potential late effects of those treatments. It should prompt discussion about recurrent and new cancers; genetic implications; possible long-term and Developing a Survivorship Care Plan It's never too soon to prepare for life after cancer PART 5: AFTER TREATMENT LEARN MORE!

WHO'S IN CHARGE? With today's complicated health care system, ever-changing insurance coverage and multiple specialists, it's hard to keep up with medical history and long-term follow-up appointments, not to mention the standard medical needs associated with aging. More oncologists are con - necting with patients' primary care physicians after treatment because they will be assuming the survivor's care after a set period of follow-up by the oncologist. But many primary care doctors are not fully versed in the follow-up requirements for patients whose medical histories include cancer. There - fore, patients should be prepared to inform their primary care doctors about their unique needs or find physicians willing to collaborate with their oncologists to better understand those needs. WHERE AND WHEN TO BEGIN? It's never too soon to start gathering the infor - mation that will become part of the SCP . A number of organizations offer plans that can be accessed online. 4 The Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania (oncolink.org/oncopilot ) 4 American Society of are designed for use by health care professionals, but some are templates that can be adapted by patients. At appointments with health care providers, patients should ask for relevant information or explanations of anything they do not clearly under - stand about their diagnosis and treatment. They might have to ask for copies of pathology reports and treatment drugs and dosages. They should ask health care personnel to translate medical termi - nology into understandable language. After the SCP is completed, patients might want to make copies and have them available for other health care providers and family members. As time progresses, patients should ask for updates to their SCPs at follow-up oncology appointments. A patient should be specific about any facts that are needed to complete the SCP , and question members of the health care team about decisions today that could have lingering effects long into the future. In addition, patients should: 4 Be sure their family members understand any genetic implications cancer has for their lives. 4 Ask if new information should be added, especially concerning late effects of drugs or radiation that were part of treatment and any associated tests or surveillance measures that are needed. 4 Ask if any new information is available that could change plans for surveillance or preven - tion of cancer recurrence.

While each individual's cancer experi - ence is unique, there are some caregiving tips that apply to nearly everyone. Talk about it. It's important that caregivers take some time to process what's happen - ing. They should talk to the patient about the decisions that will need to be made, includ - ing second opinions, treatments and where to be treated. Listen and learn. During appointments, caregivers should take notes or, with the doctor's permission, record the session. Unless the caregiver has permission from the patient to pursue a dialogue with the doctor, the patient should lead the conver - sation. Once the treatment plan has been determined by the medical team, the patient and caregiver should get the plan in writing and ask questions about any points that are unclear. Be realistic about what's ahead. Treatment can be emotionally and physically taxing, so caregivers shouldn't minimize what they or their loved ones are going through. Patients react differently to treatments, and the toll can be cumulative. Patients might feel fine at the outset of treatment, but could feel worse before starting to feel better. Perform simple acts of kindness. Small ges - tures can make a big difference. LEARN MORE!

Most patients want to take care of important affairs, such as wills, living wills and medical power of attorney. Caregivers should consider review - ing financial details, such as bank accounts, tax documents, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, retirement accounts, CDs and contact infor - mation for financial advisers. Allow patients to express feelings. Caregiv - ers should make sure patients feel safe and comfortable expressing how they feel, and remind them that there's no need to be upbeat all the time. Caregivers should also be prepared for patient mood swings, which can be a side effect of treatment. Call a family meeting. Friends and fam - ily, regardless of distance, might want to be involved in the patient's care. Caregivers should organize a family meeting, even if it's just by phone, to discuss who will do what. It's important for the patient to be involved, too. TAKING ON A NEW ROLE GET ORGANIZED Creating a Notebook THE AMOUNT OF PAPER generated by a cancer diagnosis can quickly become overwhelming.

Store extra paper for taking notes. 4 KEEP SECTIONS FOR EACH DOCTOR, as well as for pathology, radiology and lab reports. 4 ORGANIZE INFORMATION into simple categories, such as treatment options, side effects and clinical trials. 4 FILE ALL EXPLANATIONS OF BENEFITS, bills and other correspondence with the insurance company in one section. Take notes, including names and dates, of any conversations with insurance companies.Various cancer nonprofit agencies, such as the LIVESTRONG Foundation and the American Cancer Society, offer free resources for patients and caregivers. Caregivers should visit cancer.org/ caregivers to find a guide that discusses how to handle specific side effects and symptoms, as well as information on nutrition for patients with cancer, pain control and choosing home care or hospice services. Downloadable worksheets that cover treatment, financial and practical issues are provided at caregiverslibrary.org; click on the link for checklists and forms. 131 IPracticing Self-Care How and why caregivers should care for themselves IN THE CHAOS AND INTENSITY that surrounds a new cancer diagnosis, everyone tends to focus all of their care and concern on the patient. While caregivers often brush aside their own needs, experts warn that such selfless devotion can backfire. The constant stress of providing care can make caregivers more vulnerable to getting sick or burned out. Caregivers should look at their stress levels and try to prevent burnout before it happens. Following are some ways to prevent burnout. Reach out. Caring for someone full time can lead to feelings of panic, despair and isolation. After the initial crisis of diagnosis and treat - ment, there's often a lingering worry that the cancer could return. Caregivers should reach out to friends, family, online chat groups and support organizations to help reduce feelings of isolation. Support groups for cancer patients and caregivers can be located through local hos - pitals or the American Cancer Society. It makes a big difference for caregivers to know they're not alone in their experiences or feel - ings. They should try exercise, meditation and other stress reduction techniques, too. If nothing seems to help, it might be time to consult a therapist or doctor. Accept help. If friends or neighbors ask what they can do to help, caregivers should tell them.

One woman who helped her adult daughter through a cancer journey discusses what she faced in a blog for CURE \u00ae. 132 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONcan let others know exactly what is needed when asked. If friends or relatives are not available to step in for a few hours, caregivers might want to hire someone or find adult day care. The U.S. Administration on Aging offers a national database of eldercare providers at eldercare.acl.gov . Get some sleep. To overcome insomnia, experts suggest things like staying on a regular sleep schedule, keeping the bed - room quiet and using guided imagery and relaxation techniques. Cutting back on late-afternoon caffeine and adding mild to moderate exercise can also help caregivers sleep better. Alcohol can interfere with sleep as its effects wear off, so try warm milk or a soothing herbal noncaffeinated tea instead. Sometimes it helps to write down any worries and \"release\" them for the day before head - ing to bed. If all else fails, it could be time to talk with a doctor. Stay healthy. With everything they have to do in a day, caregivers often neglect basic health maintenance. Some simple things to strive for include eating regular meals that are rich in fruits and vegetables, staying hydrated and exercising, even if it's just a brisk 15-minute walk each day. Caregivers should line up help so they can keep regular appointments for their own dental cleanings, health screenings and annual checkups, too. Find meaning. Caregivers who can take their experience with cancer and learn from it might have less depression and anxiety. Through caregiving, many people find more meaning in life and are able to focus on their highest priorities. Caregivers can work on personal growth by meditating, starting journals, talking with counselors or leaning on their spiritual communities. PRACTICING SELF-CARE GET HELP Setting Up a Caregiver Team ASSEMBLING A CREW of helpful friends and family members is key. Caregivers should start by making a list of tasks they'll need help with and then think of all the family members, friends, neighbors or fellow congregants at their houses of worship who could be reliable sources of support. It might be helpful to identify a family member or friend who can take the lead in organizing what needs to get done, and choosing who will do it. Here are some tips for getting needed support. CALL FOR HELP . If a caregiver is in the thick of doctors' visits and is feeling overwhelmed, the laundry should be the last thing on the to-do list. Caregivers shouldn't be afraid to ask for help. Often friends and family members want to help but don't know what to offer. Most friends would gladly deliver a meal, do household chores or provide transportation. SEEK EMOTIONAL SUPPORT . This can often come from established cancer organizations, such as the Cancer Support Community (Helpline at 888-793- 9355; CancerSupportCommunity.org). Support groups can help caregivers avoid feelings of isolation and allow them to share their experiences, as well as their collective wisdom, with other members. There are also online support communities for caregivers, such as those hosted by Inspire (Inspire.com), where caregivers can connect with each other and share their concerns and resources in a supportive, online space. USE TECHNOLOGY . To update friends and extended family, caregivers should consider setting up a website. They'll receive support and inspiration by encouraging visitors to post messages and volunteer for tasks, and they'll be able to keep others in the loop. Sites such as the Cancer Support Community's MyLifeLine service (MyLifeLine. org), CaringBridge (CaringBridge.org) and Lotsa Helping Hands (LotsaHelpingHands.com) make it easy to create a free website that will help connect friends and family. If the caregiver isn't web-savvy, friends or family members might be willing to serve as webmasters. 133 7Useful Resources . 134 Cancer Terms . 149 For related articles, visit curetoday.comPART SEVEN Toolbox134 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONUseful Resources PEOPLE WITH CANCER and their families often need assistance coping with the emotional and practical aspects of the disease.

THYROID CANCER ThyCa: Thyroid Cancer Survivors' Association Inc. 877-588-7904; thyca@thyca.org; thyca.org/about-us S Provides support and education for thyroid cancer survivors . 149 Adenocarcinoma: Cancer that starts in the glandular tissue, such as in the ducts or lobules of the breast or in the gland cells of the prostate. Adjuvant therapy: Treatment used in addition to the main treatment. It usually refers to treatment given after surgery to increase the chances of curing the disease or keeping it in check. Angiogenesis: The formation of new blood vessels. Some cancer treatments work by blocking angiogenesis, thus preventing blood from reaching the tumor. Antigen: A substance that can cause the body's immune system to respond. This response often involves making antibodies. For example, the immune system's response to antigens that are part of bacteria and viruses helps people resist infections. Certain cancer cells have antigens that can be found by lab tests. They are important in cancer diagnosis and in watching response to treatment. Other cancer cell antigens play a role in immune reactions that could help the body resist cancer. Benign tumor: An abnormal growth that is not cancer and does not invade into nearby tissues or spread to other areas of the body. Biopsy: The removal of a sample of tissue to see whether cancer cells are present. Brachytherapy: Internal radiation treatment given by placing a radioactive source directly into the tumor or close to it. CAR-T cell therapy: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is a form of immunotherapy. To give this treatment, doctors remove immune cells known as T cells from a patient and engineer them in a lab to home in on a specific enzyme associated with the patient's cancer cells. The engineered cells are multiplied in the lab and then infused into the patient's body, where they are expected to not only recognize and fight the cancer, but also continue to multiply and stand watch against the disease indefinitely. Carcinoma: A malignant tumor that begins in the lining layer (epithelial cells) of organs.Cancer Terms Chemotherapy: Treatment with drugs to inhibit cancer cell division. Chemotherapy is often used with surgery or radiation to treat cancer when the cancer has spread, when it has come back (recurred) or when there is a strong chance it could recur. Clinical trials: Research studies that test new drugs or treatments and compare them with current standard treatments. Before a new treatment is used on people, it is studied in the lab. If lab studies suggest the treatment works, it is tested on human volunteers. These human studies are called clinical trials. Cytokine: A protein made by certain cells that affect the immune system and can stimulate immunity or slow it down. Cytokine release syndrome: This severe potential side effect, also known as a cytokine storm, occurs when immunotherapy stimulates a patient's immune cells so thoroughly that they quickly release many proteins known as cytokines. The immune system then wages an attack on both cancerous and healthy tissues. Symptoms include fever, nausea, headache, rash, low blood cell counts and changes in the brain that cause confusion or seizures. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid): The genetic \"blueprint\" found in the nucleus of each cell. DNA holds genetic information for proteins involved in cell structure, growth and function. Enzyme: A protein that starts, helps or speeds up the rate of chemical reactions in living cells. Gene: A segment of DNA that contains information on hereditary characteristics, such as hair color, eye color and height, as well as susceptibility to certain diseases. Genetic testing: Tests performed to determine whether a person has certain gene changes known to increase the risk of cancer or other diseases. Genomic testing: Assessing genomic changes in the tumor that are acquired, not inherited, and may be treatable with specific targeted therapies. These tests can be done via tumor biopsy or blood testing known as liquid biopsy. Growth factors: Naturally occurring proteins that help cells grow and divide. Some cancer cells are too sensitive to growth factors, which helps them grow quickly. Hereditary cancer syndrome: Conditions associated with cancers that occur in several family members because of an inherited, mutated gene.GLOSSARY150 CANCER GUIDE 14TH EDITIONHormone therapy: Treatment with drugs that interfere with hormone production or hormone action, or the surgical removal of hormone-producing glands. Hormone therapy can help kill or slow the growth of cancer cells that depend on hormones to grow. Immunotherapy: Treatments that promote or support the body's immune system response to a disease such as cancer. Leukemia: Cancer of the blood or blood-forming organs. People with leukemia often have a noticeable increase in white blood cells (leukocytes). Liquid biopsy: This blood test finds tumor cells, or DNA pieces from tumor cells, that are circulating in the blood. It can detect minimal amounts of cancer that cannot be seen on scans and help guide a recurrence-preventing treatment plan or track its effectiveness. A series of these tests over time can assist in monitoring the molecular changes occurring within a tumor, providing a research tool to aid in developing more effective cancer drugs. This remains investigational for most tumor types. Localized (or local) cancer: A cancer that is confined to the organ where it started; that is, it has not spread to distant parts of the body. Lymph nodes: Small bean-shaped collections of immune system tissue, such as lymphocytes, found along lymphatic vessels. They remove cell waste, germs and other harmful substances from the lymph. They help fight infections and also have a role in fighting cancer, although cancers sometimes spread through the lymph system. Lymphoma: A cancer of the immune system cells called lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). It often affects the lymphatic system, a network of thin vessels and nodes throughout the body. The two main types of lymphoma are Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin. Malignant: Cancerous cells that can invade nearby tissues or spread (metastasize) to distant areas of the body. Metastasis: The spread of cancer cells to one or more sites elsewhere in the body, often by way of the lymph system or bloodstream. Regional metastasis is cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes, tissues or organs close to the primary site. Distant metastasis is cancer that has spread to organs or tissues that are farther away (such as when prostate cancer spreads to the bones, lungs or liver). Mutation: A change in the DNA of a cell. Cancer is thought to be due to changes in a cell's DNA. Most mutations happen after the person is born. Neoadjuvant therapy: Systemic and/or radiation treatment given before the main treatment. Palliative treatment: Treatment that relieves symptoms, such as pain, but is not expected to cure the disease. Its main purpose is to improve the patient's quality of life. Pathologist: A doctor who specializes in diagnosis and classification of diseases by lab tests such as examining tissue under a microscope. The pathologist determines the specifics of a diagnosis. Radiation therapy: Treatment with high-energy rays (ionizing energy, such as X-rays) or particles to kill or shrink cancer cells. The radiation can come from outside of the body (external radiation) or from radioactive materials placed directly in or near the tumor (brachytherapy or internal radiation). Recurrence: The return of cancer after treatment. Local recurrence means that the cancer has come back in the same location as the original cancer. Regional recurrence means that the cancer has come back after treatment in the nearby tissues or lymph nodes near the primary site. Distant recurrence occurs when cancer comes back in distant organs or tissues after treatment. Remission: Complete or partial disappearance of the signs and symptoms of cancer in response to treatment. A remission might not be a cure. Sarcoma: A malignant tumor that starts in connective tissues, such as cartilage, fat, muscle or bone. Standard therapy: The most commonly used and widely accepted form of treatment that has been tested and proven. Stem cell transplantation: A procedure used to restock stem cells in the bone marrow when they have been destroyed by chemotherapy, radiation or disease. Stem cells can be the patient's own (autologous) or can come from someone else (allogeneic). Bone marrow transplantations were the first method for replacing stem cells. Targeted therapy: Treatment to attack the part of cancer cells that make them different from normal cells. Targeted agents tend to have different side effects than conventional chemotherapy drugs.
