Although some US elected officials have responded by issuing [vaccine]mandates, others have amplified [vaccine hesitancy]by broadcasting messages that minimize [vaccine efficacy]. The politically polarized [nature]of COVID-19 information on [social media]has given rise to [incivility], wherein [health attitudes]often hinge more on political ideology than [science]. Objective:To the best of our [knowledge], [incivility]has not been studied in the context of discourse regarding [COVID-19 vaccines]and mandates. Specifically, there is little focus on the [psychological processes]that elicit uncivil [vaccine]discourse and [behaviors]. Thus, discourse [anxiety], 2 different processing]approaches (1) the [Linguistic]Inquiry and Word Count computational tool and (2) the Google Perspective application [programming]interface ( [API]) to analyze a related to [COVID-19 vaccine]mandates from September 14, 2021, to October 1, 2021. To collect the tweets, we used the Twitter [API]Tweet Downloader Tool (version 2). we set]of 375,000 [vaccine]-related tweets using [keywords]to extract on [vaccine]mandates. We relied on the [Linguistic]Inquiry and Word Count computational to [incivility], we used the Google Perspective [API]. Results:This study resolved discrepant operationalizations of [incivility]by introducing [incivility]as a multifaceted construct and explored the distinct emotional processes underlying 5 dimensions of discourse [incivility]. The findings revealed that 3 types of [emotions]- [anxiety], [anger], and [sadness]-were uniquely associated with dimensions of [incivility](eg, [toxicity], severe [toxicity], insult, profanity, threat, and identity attacks). Specifically, the results showed that [anger]was significantly positively associated with all dimensions of [incivility](all P<.001), whereas [sadness]was significantly positively related to threat (P=.04). Conversely, [anxiety]was significantly negatively associated with identity attack (P=.03) and profanity (P=.02). Conclusions:The results suggest that our multidimensional approach to [incivility]is a promising alternative to the [psychological uncivil [sadness]can enable develop effective interventions against uncivil [vaccine]discourse. Given the need for real- [time] [monitoring]and automated responses to the spread of [health]information and [misinformation]on the web, [social media]platforms can harness the Google Perspective [API]to offer users immediate, automated [feedback]when it "}
