Theepidemiological characteristics of HCV infection were very similar to those in countrieswith high prevalence such as Japan, Korea, Italy, and India.

Anti-HCV seropositives with elevated serum HCV RNA levels werefound to have an increasing risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in a dose-response relationship. In addition to the serum HCV alanine amino- transferase levels and HCV genotype also had long-term predictability for the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, anti-HCV seropositives with detectable serum HCVRNA levels had an increased mortality from extrahepatic diseases such as cerebrovascularand renal diseases.

Liver cirrhosis eventuates in 20% to30% patients with chronic HCV infection, decades [1]. Once hepatocellular carci- noma develops 4% of these patients per year [2]. HCV was estimated to be attributable to one third of hepa-tocellular carcinoma cases globally [3]. Due to successful hepatitis B virus vaccination programs, HCV related healthburdens are emerging quickly in Asian countries andrepresent a great public health burden [4]. Because a vaccine is not available and treatment options are still limited andexpensive, the efforts of infection controls should befocused on primary prevention. A long-term follow-upcohort may help evaluate the incidence and mortality ofvarious diseases associated with chronic HCV infection. Inthis review article, we describe the study population, enrollment and follow-up procedures, recent ndings and future perspectives of Risk Elevation of Viral Load Elevationand Associated Liver Disease/Cancer in HCV (REVEAL-HCV)study. 2. REVEAL-HCV study cohort The REVEAL-HCV study cohort was recruited from a commu-nity-based cancer screening program conducted in Taiwanduring 1991 to 1992. There were seven townships selected asthe study areas, including two northern townships (Sanchi and Chutung) and two southern townships (Potzu and Kaohsu) on main Taiwan Island, and three townships(Makung, Huhsi, and Paihsa) on Penghu Islets. There were 89,293 inhabitants aged 30 to 65 years in the seven study townships invited to participate in the study,and 23,820 (11,973 males and 11,847 females) were enrolledafter giving written informed consent. The vital status of thestudy participants were followed by the computerizedlinkage with the national cancer registration and deathcertication proles. The national identication number,date of birth, and sex were used as the linking variables to double-check the vital status and causes of death of study participants. At enrollment, the participants were person-ally interviewed using structured questionnaires by well-trained public health nurses. The information collectedincluded the sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex,educational levels, occupation, etc.), habits of life styles(cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, betel nut chew-ing), and personal and family history of major diseases.Anthropometric measurements including weight and heightwere also performed. In addition to the questionnaire interview, 10 mL blood samples were collected from each participant at study entry.The blood samples were obtained using disposable needlesand heparinized vacuum syringes. They were fractioned onthe day and stored at e70 /C14C until assayed. Serum samples of all participants were tested for hepatitis Bsurface antigen (HBsAg) by radioimmunoassay (AbbottLaboratories, North Chicago, IL, USA), by enzymeimmunoassay (Abbott serum levels of L'Etoile, France). Participants who were seropositive for anti-HCV were further examined for serum HCV RNA levels by reaction using the COBAS TaqMan HCV test, v2.0 (RocheDiagnostics, Indianapolis, NJ, USA), and an in vitro nucleic acid amplication test for the quantication of HCV RNA. Thequantication method used the high pure system viral nucleicacid kit for manual specimen preparation and the COBASTaqMan 48 Analyzer for automated amplication and detec-tion. The manufacturer's procedures for sample preparationto extract HCV RNA, automated reverse transcription of thetarget RNA to generate complementary DNA, and amplica-tion of target cDNA were followed. In any test procedure, a replicate of negative, low-positive, and high-positive controls were included in each run for HCV RNA quantica-tion. The HCV RNA titer was expressed in international units(IU)/mL according to the WHO International Standard for HCVRNA NAT assays, and the linear range for the COBAS TaqManHCV test was from 25 IU/mL to 3.9 /C210 8IU/mL. Moreover, those with positive serum HCV RNA levels were examined forHCV genotypes by melting curve analysis, which could effec-tively differentiate different HCV genotypes by showingdifferent melting seropositive for HBsAg or anti-HCV were invited to receive regular health examinations. The health examinations included abdominal ultrasonography exami-nations and blood tests. The certied hepatologistsperformed the high-resolution real-time abdominal ultra-sonography and interpreted according to a standardizedprotocol. Liver cirrhosis was determined based on a quanti-tative scoring system, which was derived from the appear-ance of liver surface (normal, irregular, undulated), liverparenchymal texture (normal, heterogeneous, coarse), intrahepatic blood vessel size (normal, obscure, narrowing), and splenic size (normal, enlarged) [7e9]. The serological tests included serum levels of AST, ALT, and a-fetoprotein. To ensure all study participants received standard care,those who had abnormal serum levels of ALT and/or a- fetoprotein levels and ultrasonographic ndings werereferred to hepatologists in medical centers for furtherclinical There were 1095 participants seropositive for anti-HCV but for HBsAg. 975 (89%) had adequateretrievable serum samples for HCV RNA test. Comparing those who had adequate serum samples ( n\u00bc975) and those without adequate serum samples for HCV RNA test ( n\u00bc120), there were no signicant differences in the distributions of baseline characteristics except for gender. However, for the 975 anti-HCV seropositives with adequate samples for HCV RNA test,the proportion of gender was similar to that of all 1095 anti-HCV seropositives.BioMedicine 2 (2012) 99 e107 1003. Seroprevalence of by age and gender There 1313 participants seropositive for anti-HCV, giving seroprevalence of 5.5% in our study population. The seropre-valence increased with age. For females, for the 30 to 34, 35 to 39, 40 to 44, 45 to 49, 50 to 54,55 to 59, and 60 to 65 year age groups. The correspondingseroprevalence for males was 2.7%, 3.7%, 3.2%, 5.2%, 5.6%, 6.1%, respectively. 1 , females had higher age-specic anti-HCV seroprevalence than males with the overall seroprevalence of 6.2% versus 4.8%, respectively. The major risk factors of HCV infection in the REVEAL-HCV study population were iatrogenic risk factors including bloodtransfusion, hemodialysis, medical injections, and dentalprocedures. In our previous reports, >80% HCV infection could be attributable to iatrogenic factors [10,11] . Older people had an increased chance to receive multiple medical injectionsand had an increased cumulative risk of HCV infection in theirlifetime. The gender difference in the seroprevalence of HCV infection might be explained by: 1) females being more con- cerned about their minor illness and more likely to receiveglucose-based nutrient or vitamin injections than males,which were frequently prescribed to sick people; or 2) malesinfected with HCV having a higher mortality rate than infec-ted females, thus the anti-HCV prevalence in males wouldmore likely to be lower than females due to a faster attrition ofthe HCV-infected [12]. 4. HCV RNA seropositive rate and its associated baseline characteristics Serum HCV RNA was detectable in 676 (69.3%) anti-HCV seropositives in the REVEAL-HCV study cohort. Table 1 shows the HCV RNA seropositive rate by baseline character-istics. The HCV RNA seropositive rate was 78.8% in males and62.0% in females, suggesting that females were more likely tohave spontaneous seroclearance of HCV RNA. Participantswith the habit of cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption had a higher HCV RNA seropositive rate than those without these habits. However, the associations might result from thehigher proportions of cigarette smokers and alcohol drinkersin males than females. After adjustment for gender, there wasno association between the HCV RNA seropositivity and habitsof cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking. There was nosignicant association with HCV RNA seropositivity for bodymass index (BMI) and history of diabetes. Participants with increasing serum ALT levels had elevated HCV RNA seropositive rates. In comparison to those withserum ALT levels /C2015 U/L as the referent, the interval (CI)] of having detectableserum RNA levels 3.69 (2.69 e5.06) and 10.18 (5.58e18.60), respectively, for serum ALT levels of 15 to 45 U/L and higher than 45 U/L. Males had a 2.26-fold (95% CI1.66e3.07) higher risk of having detectable serum HCV RNA after adjustment for serum ALT levels. It is interesting to notethat females had a higher anti-HCV seroprevalence, as showninFig. 1 , but seropositive rate among anti- HCV seropositives than males, as shown in Fig. 2 . It suggests that the serum HCV RNA level might be a seromarker to beconsidered in management of anti-HCV seropositives. However, the importance and signicance of this seromarker should be further evaluated by comparing the healthoutcomes between HCV RNA seronegative and seropositiveparticipants who were seropositive for anti-HCV. 5. Incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma by baseline characteristics There were 101 newly developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases that occurred after 17,944 person-years of follow-up, giving an incidence rate of 562.9 per 100,000 person-years.Table 2 shows the number of participants, person-years of follow-up, number of HCC cases, and the incidence rate of HCC by baseline characteristics. Older individuals, or thosewith habits of cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption,increased BMI ( /C2125 kg/m 2), elevated serum ALT levels, or detectable serum HCV RNA levels had an increased incidence of HCC among the 1095 anti-HCV seropositives who were seronegative for HBsAg. The baseline characteristics that were signicantly associated with increased HCC risk in univariateanalyses were included in the subsequent multivariate anal-yses. Participants with older age, a habit of cigarette smokingor alcohol consumption, or increased BMI still had a signi-cantly increased HCC risk after adjustment for each other, butno signicant association was observed for habits of cigarettesmoking or alcohol consumption after further adjustment forserum levels of ALT and HCV RNA. In comparison to those with serum ALT levels /C2015 U/L as the referent group, the ratio (95% was 1.78(1.01e3.14) and 2.98 (1.65 e5.40), respectively, for serum ALT levels of 16 to 44 U/L and /C2145 U/L. Individuals with detectable serum HCV RNA had 5.67 times greater risk of HCC than thosewith undetectable HCV RNA. In a recent study [13], it was found that serum levels of ALT and HCV RNA and HCVgenotype had long-term predictability for HCC. These sero-markers had predictability 5 years or earlier than the Fig. 1 eSeroprevalence of anti-HCV by age and gender.BioMedicine 2 (2012) 99e 107 101occurrence of HCC. After 15 years of follow-up, the cumulative HCC risk was only 0.4% for participants seronegative for anti-HCV. There was an increasing cumulative HCC risk for anti-HCV-seropositive with HCC risk was forserum ALT levels U/L, and >45 U/L, respectively for trend). Among pants with detectable serum HCV RNA, the cumulative HCC incidence was the elevating serum levels of HCV RNA was found not only in men but also in women [14]. 6. All causes and liver-related mortality by baseline characteristics Table 3 shows all-causes and liver-related mortality rates and associated hazard ratios for each baseline characteristic. The mortality rate from all causes was 1557.7 per 100,000 person-years and the liver-related mortality rate was 493.5 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The cumulative mortality from all causes of death was 30.1% and 12.8% after 17 years offollow-up for participants with detectable and undetectableserum HCV RNA, respectively. Similarly, those with detectableserum HCV RNA had an increased cumulative mortality fromliver-related diseases compared with those with undetectable Fig. 2 eSeropositive rate of HCV RNA among anti-HCV- seropositives by age and gender.Table 1 eHCV RNA seropositive rates by baseline characteristics study.

Generally, male gender, older age, habits of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption, BMI /C2125 kg/m2, history of diabetes, elevated serum ALT levels, and detectable serum HCV RNA levels were associated with an increased mortalityfrom all causes or liver-related deaths. After adjustment forpotential risk factors, participants with detectable serum HCVRNA had an increased risk for all causes of death and hepatic-related deaths with the adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI) of 2.78(1.56e3.33) and 6.53 (2.32 e18.37), respectively. This implies that those with detectable serum HCV RNA levels might die from other extrahepatic diseases in addition to hepaticdiseases. Our ndings indicate that the serum HCV RNA levelis an important marker for management of individuals sero-positive for anti-HCV. 7. HCV infection and deaths from extrahepatic diseases The mortality from extrahepatic diseases was 1064.2 per 100,000 person-years for the participants in the REVEAL-HCV cohort. Among participants seronegative for HBsAg, thecumulative mortality from had a 1.4-fold increased riskof dying extrahepatic diseases after adjustment for ageand sex. Anti-HCV seropositives had an increased mortalityfrom either extrahepatic cancers or extrahepatic diseasesother than cancers with age-sex-adjusted hazard ratio (95%CI) of 1.23 (0.92 e1.65) and 1.43 (1.19 e1.73), respectively. Fig. 3 shows the associations between extrahepatic deaths andHCV infection. The HCV infection was associated with anincreased mortality from circulatory diseases. Based on thelong-term follow-up design of the REVEAL-HCV study, therewas a correct causal temporality for the HCV-induced atherosclerotic diseases [16]. Moreover, the increasing serum HCV RNA levels were found to be associated with mortality from cerebrovascular disease in a dose-responserelationship after adjustment for conventional risk factorsfor cerebrovascular disease. Compared with participantsseronegative for anti-HCV as the referent group, themultivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI) of dying fromcerebrovascular disease was 1.43 (0.63 e3.23), 2.29 (1.38 e3.82), and 2.81 (1.25 e6.35), respectively, for participants high serum levelsof HCV RNA ( p<0.001 for trend). However, no signicant association between HCV genotype and mortalityfrom cerebrovascular disease [17]. In addition, HCV infection was associated with an increased mortality from renaldisease and cancers of the esophagus, prostate, and thyroid,and the mortality was even higher for those with detectableserum of HCV RNA [15].Table 2 eNumbers of participants, person-years of follow-up, hepatocellular carcinoma case numbers and incidence rates by baseline characteristics.

Advantages and limitations of the REVEAL-HCV study Chronic hepatitis C patients in Taiwan rarely received anti- viral treatment with interferon due to its high cost andadverse effects until November 2003, when patients withabnormal serum ALT levels ( >82 U/L) and moderate brosis proven by liver biopsy could be reimbursed for treatment by the National Health Insurance. Therefore this cohort study may be considered as a natural history study of chronichepatitis C. To ensure that study participants received stan-dard care, those who had abnormal serum levels of ALT anda-fetoprotein or abnormal ultrasonographic ndings were referred to medical centers for further clinical management inthis study. This cohort, consisting of 1000 anti-HCV seropos-itives, provided an exceptional opportunity to examine theseromarker changes and liver disease occurrence of anti-HCVseropositives during the natural course of HCV infection. Participants enrolled in the REVEAL-HCV cohort lived in the community. Unlike other cohorts, which enrolled patientswith experiences of drug injections [18]or HCV-contaminated vaccinations [19,20] , the exact time of HCV infection was unavailable for our participants. As the major risk factors ofHCV infection in the REVEAL-HCV cohort were iatrogenicfactors, it was difcult to obtain the exact time of HCV infec-tion; the information on advanced brosis or mild cirrhosiswas not available in this community-based cohort because itis not practical to have asymptomatic participants examinedby liver biopsy. Liver cirrhosis is an intermediate clinicaloutcome before the occurrence of HCC among chronic hepa- titis C patients. Based on the abdominal ultrasonographic examination and serial tests of serum levels of AST and ALT,>80% of newly-developed HCC cases in participants seropos- had liver cirrhosis detected by ultrasonog- raphy and/or an increased ratio between serum levels of ASTand ALT. 9. Summary Based on the REVEAL-HCV cohort study, we found that anti-HCV seropositives with detectable serum HCV RNA levelshad extrahepaticdiseases. Anti-HCV seropositives with undetectable serumHCV risk similar to anti-HCV seronegatives (1.1 vs. 0.4%), implying that antiviral treatment to aid seroclearance of HCV RNA may benet patients. Inaddition, the ndings suggest that clinical patients experi-enced sustained virologic response after receiving antiviraltherapy may have reduced HCC risk and improved survival[21e26]. Recent trials showed that use of direct-acting anti- viral agents may achieve sustained virologic response amongpatients who had not had a response to prior therapy [27,28] . Our study provides evidence that patients with HCV infection,particular for those with active HCV infection (seropositive forHCV RNA), should be encouraged for intensive management because they had an increased risk of HCC and mortality from hepatic or extrahepatic diseases. We also found that theprevalence of anti-HCV in a community was associated withHCV RNA seropositive rate withdetectable RNA levels played a major role in thetransmission of the virus in the community [12]. For the control of hepatic or extraheptic diseases and virus infection,anti-HCV seropositives should be tested for serum HCV RNAlevels by a sensitive assay. Those with active HCV infectionshould be instructed to be aware of HCV-related health outcomes and HCV transmission routes as well as the need to take actions for HCV RNA seroclearance. 10. Future perspectives Recently, human genetic variants predicting successfultreatments have been identied by genome-wide association study (GWAS) from several independent study groups [29e31]. They studied different ethnic populations and found that genetic variants near the IL28B gene were associated withantiviral response in patients infected with HCV genotype 1.Two polymorphisms IFN rs12979860 and rs8099917, were associated with antiviral treatment responsein chronic hepatitis C patients [29e31]. The C allele of the SNP (rs12979860) was found to be associated with the spontaneousclearance of HCV in a follow-up study [32]. A recent study showed that Taiwanese patients with chronic hepatitis C receiving antiviral therapy have a lower daily viral production rate than western patients, and the rs8099917 TT genotypemay contribute to the increased viral clearance rate and bettervirological responses [33]. These ndings imply that host genetic factors may be involved in the natural course of HCVinfection and the pathogenesis of liver diseases. IL28B poly-morphism (T allele) seems to be involved in the developmentof HCV-induced HCC and the course of HCV recurrence afterliver transplantation in a recent study [34]. In Taiwan, most chronic hepatitis C patients carried the favorable genotypeassociated with better treatment responses and the minorallele frequency (T of rs12979860 and G of rs8099917) were very rare [35e38]. To better understand the associations between the SNPs near IL28B and the risk of liver cirrhosis or HCC, a study with a large sample size is needed. In addition to theIL28B gene, a recent GWAS conducted in Japan identied SNPsassociated with the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinomaamong chronic hepatitis C patients [39,40] . It will be Fig. 3 eHepatitis C virus infection and mortality from extrahepatic diseases.BioMedicine 2 (2012) 99e 107 105interesting to discover these genetic variants to understand the pathogenesis of liver disease progression further or to apply them as diagnostic or risk predictive biomarkers [41]. Although high-throughput technologies to discover humangenetic variants have developed rapidly to accelerate thegenotyping, validation of genetic markers in other externalpopulations is still essential and functional studies areneeded. Moreover, to stratify high-risk patients who needintensive care is essential. Recently, several study groupsfocus on the development of prediction models for liver-related outcomes among chronic hepatitis C patients[41e47], which may aid physicians to communicate with patients and enhance patients' compliance to receive stan-dard care. In Taiwan, pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin is thestandard care for chronic hepatitis C patients [48,49] . The sustained virologic response rate for patients with genotype 1was around 70% [25,49] . It will be important to follow the subsequent risk for liver-related outcomes among patientswith sustained virologic response or with nonvirologicresponse as well as to compare the disease burdens occurredin patients with treatment experiences or not [50]. Collabo- rative studies to understand the diseases associated with HCVinfection better and to promote appropriate clinical manage- ments of chronic hepatitis C patients are in urgent need.
