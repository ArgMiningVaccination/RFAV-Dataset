Acudetox Specialists can also employ the use of magnetic beads or seeds in place of needles. Acupressure beads can be placed in the same locations with the use of medical tape, and can be taken out of the office to provide longer lasting relief. Acupressure beads can be used in place of acupuncture needles, or in conjunction with them for optimal support. Acudetox Acudetox has been proven to help reduce following: *Physical Pain *Anxiety *Insomnia *Withdrawal *Emotional Pain *Trauma Recovery and Healing *ADD/ADHD The Acudetox protocol was developed by the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA) in 1985 for managing behavioral health symptoms, including addiction. The NADA protocol of Acudetox is simply the name for the protocol of the series of 5 tiny needles that are placed at specific points in the ear. Acudetox is an evidence-based technique that has many benefits, including assisting in the management of behavioral health symptoms. Due to its effectiveness, Acudetox is integrated in treatment centers all over the world. Among other things, Acudetox has been proven to help reduce the following: pain, anxiety, insomnia, withdrawal from substances, substance use and cravings (including nicotine), and agitation. Luckily, Acudetox is safe for all types of people, including those with Diabetes and Hemophilia. So, everyone can enjoy the benefits of this technique! Acudetox is a kind of acupuncture performed on the ears. First used by the Chinese, acupuncture is the world's oldest medical science and has been for over 3,000 years to harmonize the body's system. The major difference between acupuncture and Acudetox is that general acupuncture is performed by a licensed acupuncturist at certain points all over the body, whereas Acudetox is more discreet since only 5 points in the ears are accessed. Furthermore, Acudetox is more cost-effective as it only costs a fraction of what traditional full-body acupuncture costs. It is important to note, however, that even though Acudetox is performed only on the ears, it is just as effective as full-body acupuncture for gaining relief from symptoms since the whole human body is mapped in the ear. Therefore, similar to acupressure or reflexology, we can address issues in various systems of the body simply by using the ear as a \"gateway\" to these systems. "}
