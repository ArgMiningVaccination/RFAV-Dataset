Messenger RNA (mRNA) already exists in your body. It carries a \"message\" - instructions that direct your cells what to do. Fighting disease differently mRNA medicines fight diseases in a different way than traditional medicine by prompting your immune system to create the tools to treat or prevent disease. Limitless treatments We believe that if mRNA can treat one disease, it can treat many diseases. We will use mRNA to treat diseases for which there are currently no treatments. Helping more people mRNA medicine contains no animal products or preservatives, making medicine accessible for as many people as possible. More medicines, faster Our platform enables rapid design, research and testing of multiple mRNAs, within days. Our novel production methods allow us to get medicines to more people, faster.
