So, latex allergic people may get allergic to these fruits also. People who have constant or increased contact with latex gloves or other products are more prone to be affected with latex allergy. This group includes medical professionals, those who undergo repeated surgeries, people who work in rubber industry etc. and also those with a family history of allergy. Ayurveda describes exposure to cold wind as the reason for Udarda.
