The types Therefore, elucidation of the mechanisms through which the proteolytic activity, secretion, and gene expression of MMP-3 are inhibited by plant-derived natural products used as arthritis remedies in folk medicine will support the effective treatment of osteoarthritis, and may lead to new therapeutic strategies. [9](#B9-kjpp-20-221) [10](#B10-kjpp-20-221) [11](#B11-kjpp-20-221) [12](#B12-kjpp-20-221) [13](#B13-kjpp-20-221)]. through NF-B signaling pathway [ [10](#B10-kjpp-20-221) [11](#B11-kjpp-20-221)]. Prunetin showed anti-obesity potential [12](#B12-kjpp-20-221)] and inhibited human liver aldehyde dehydrogenase [ [13](#B13-kjpp-20-221)]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no report about the effects of prunetin on the gene expression, secretion, and enzyme an articular chondrocytes, or on in vivo production of MMP-3 in the rat knee joint. Therefore, to evaluate the chondroprotective potential of prunetin, we investigated its effects on IL-1-induced gene expression, secretion, and enzyme activity of MMP-3 in vitro, and on production of MMP-3 in vivo. METHODS Materials Primary cultures of chondrocytes from rabbit articular Cartilage [14](#B14-kjpp-20-221)]. Treatment of cells with prunetin and the other natural products Cytotoxicity assay [15](#B15-kjpp-20-221)]. Isolation of total RNA and RT-PCR [14](#B14-kjpp-20-221)]. Western blot analysis for measuring secretion level of MMP-3 in culture supernatant Casein zymography the proteolytic activity of vivo experiments RESULTS Effect of prunetin, glycyrrhizin on MMP-3 gene expression [Fig. expression, \u00b5M, and 100 \u00b5M. However, glycyrrhizin or quercitrin did not significantly affect MMP-3 gene expression. Effect of prunetin on proliferation of rabbit chondrocytes [Fig. 3](#F3-kjpp-20-221), prunetin showed no significant cytotoxicity at the concentrations of 1, 10, 50, and 100 \u00b5M. The numbers of cells in prunetin-treated cultures were 100\u00b116%, 97\u00b19%, 89\u00b121%, 105\u00b111%, and 92\u00b121% for control, 1, 10, 50, and 100 \u00b5M prunetin, respectively. Effect of prunetin on the gene expression in ADAMTS-4, from chondrocytes. inhibited the effects of IL-1 on MMP-3 secretion. This result means that prunetin can control the steps of protein synthesis and secretion of MMP-3. Effect of prunetin on in rabbit articular chondrocytes, and this effect was inhibited by pretreatment with prunetin. Effect of prunetin on MMP-3 articular [12](#B12-kjpp-20-221) [13](#B13-kjpp-20-221)]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no report on the effects of prunetin on the gene expression, secretion, and enzyme activity of which is an articular cartilage-degradative enzyme that decomposes proteoglycans. Therefore, we examined the prunetin on MMP-3 gene expression, secretion, and proteolytic activty in primary cultured rabbit articular chondrocytes, as well as on MMP-3 production in the rat knee joint. [16](#B16-kjpp-20-221) [17](#B17-kjpp-20-221) [18](#B18-kjpp-20-221) [19](#B19-kjpp-20-221)]. IL-1 is an inflammatory cytokine that is produced by cells in articular tissues, including chondrocytes, and which can increase expression of MMPs and stimulate the progression of osteoarthritis. IL-1 plays an important role in the initiation and progression of destruction of articular cartilage by suppressing synthesis of collagen and stimulating MMP expression [ [18](#B18-kjpp-20-221) [20](#B20-kjpp-20-221) [21](#B21-kjpp-20-221)]. Particularly, MMP-3 has been reported to play a pivotal pathophysiological role in osteoarthritis by degrading components of the extracellular matrix, such as proteoglycans. MMP-3 levels were increased more than MMP-1 levels in patients suffering from osteoarthritis in knee joints compared to the control group [ [7](#B7-kjpp-20-221) [22](#B22-kjpp-20-221)]. [Fig. 2](#F2-kjpp-20-221)). However, glycyrrhizin from Glycyrrhizae Radix or similar flavonoidal compounds with prunetin - affect MMP-3 gene expression ( [Figs. 1](#F1-kjpp-20-221), [2](#F2-kjpp-20-221)). This result suggests that prunetin suppresses aggrecanase in cartilage of mouse and ADAMTS-5 has been known to be important in cartilage matrix destruction during osteoarthritis [ [30](#B30-kjpp-20-221) [31](#B31-kjpp-20-221)]. [Fig. in rabbit chondrocytes. Thus, the chondroprotective effects of prunetin are supported by its regulation of the gene expression of diverse proteases involved in the destruction of articular cartilage in osteoarthritis. [Fig. 5](#F5-kjpp-20-221), stimulation with IL-1 increased the secretion of MMP-3 from chondrocytes, and this effect was suppressed by prunetin. This result shows that prunetin can regulate the step of protein synthesis and secretion of MMP-3. [Fig. 5](#F5-kjpp-20-221), the proteolytic activity of MMP-3 increased when rabbit articular chondrocytes were stimulated with IL-1. This effect was suppressed by pretreatment with prunetin. This result suggests that prunetin can also affect the proteolytic activity of overproduced and IL-1-stimulated production of MMP-3 in articular cartilage tissue. This result shows that, in addition to its in vitro effects, prunetin exerts chondroprotective effects in vivo when administered via intraarticular injection. "}
