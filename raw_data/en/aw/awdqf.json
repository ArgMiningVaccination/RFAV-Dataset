{"title": "Keeping Your Dog Hydrated", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": "Whole Dog Journal", "date": "2002-05-20", "cleaned_text": "Summer is upon us, with its irresistible invitation to visit parks, trails, and beaches, accompanied by our favorite canine companions. Along with the doggie days of summer comes the hidden threat of dehydration - for us and our dogs - and its deadly companion, heat stroke. Every good hiker knows how important it is to stay hydrated. We also know that water can be hard to come by on those rugged mountaintop trails, and that the only water at some beaches is briny and undrinkable. What's a responsible canine caretaker to do? Lots of dogs have learned to lap from the end of their guardian's sports bottle, but that coats your sports bottle tip with dog slobber, and wastes the water you worked so hard to bring along. Pet product companies have come to the rescue. The active dog owner can choose from a variety of water bottles designed with the hiking hound in mind. A good dog bottle should be sturdy, easy to fill, easy to dispense water from, hold an ample water supply, come with a workable dish from which your dog can drink, be comfortable to carry, not leak (duh!), and be reasonably priced. Insulated sleeves to keep water cool are a bonus, and also provide a nice padded cushion for that bottle that is banging on your hip. We evaluated five water bottles, and found at least a couple that we would be more than happy to take along on our next hike. We like how the Walk-n-Water, a relatively tough, flask-shaped plastic bottle laid comfortably flat against our side when we slipped the nylon carrying-strap over our heads. Plus, the bottle and its own plastic water bowl snap together snugly to make a tidy, unobtrusive package. The bottle does not leak, either lying down, held upright, or even held upside down. It holds about four cups of water and is easy to fill. We especially appreciated the products that allowed humans and dogs to share the water - without having to share the bowl! With its separate bowl for the dog, and a pop-up spout similar to those on sports bottles, you can squeeze water into the bowl, and drink from the spout yourself. The mid-range price on our top-rated bottle is icing on the cake! The plastic water bottle provided with the thermo-Sac holds 1.5 liters (about six cups) - the greatest capacity of any of the products we evaluated, making it a better choice, perhaps, for those all-day hikes with multiple dogs. But we found it less comfortable to carry than the flatter, sleeker Walk-n-Water; being rounder, the thermo-Sac bangs more against your side. Banging aside (sorry), we liked the sunshine-yellow insulated water bottle carrier with its matching folding water bowl. The top of the insulated sleeve zips open in order to accept the bottle. The bottle slides in snugly but easily. It takes a little extra pressure to pull the top over the bottle and fit the spout through the hole provided for that purpose, but it wasn't difficult, and it's nice that the bottle absolutely cannot bounce in or fall out of the carrier. The insulation keeps the water cool for several hours. The soft, folding water bowl (the pet-Sac) attaches to the carrying-strap with a Velcro loop, so it is easy to remove for use at watering time. Again, it's wonderful to be able to drink from the bottle yourself, and squeeze water into the bowl for your dog, without having to worry about swapping germs. However, we would appreciate a second strap that goes around the wearer's hips, or something else that could keep the bottle from banging against the person carrying it, and we would probably stuff the foldable bowl into our daypack or pocket rather than leaving it attached to the strap, where it can get in the way. Like our top choice, the Handi-Drink2! plastic water bottle also snaps into its own dish, but the similarity ends there. This is a round bottle that folds into a box-shaped trough that the dog can drink from, so it doesn't lie as neatly against the hiker's side as the Walk-n-Water. The unit either clips onto your belt or daypack by a plastic hook, or hangs around your neck by a slender nylon cord. Yes, cord; this is the only product we found meant for carrying water that didn't come with a wide nylon strap. Just imagine that cord cutting into your neck or shoulder! This must explain why we see these bottles in people's hands at the dog park, but we don't see them out on the trail. Also, the water-dispensing nozzle is made of rubber or rubberized plastic, with several slits cut in it, so as to release water into the trough when the bottle is squeezed. Unfortunately, there is no way to close the slits, so while the bottle does not leak when upright or laid flat on a surface, any inadvertent squeezing causes water to ooze out. It has a smaller capacity bottle than our top choices - holding only about 2 cups, but it is the least expensive of the water bottles we evaluated. This product may be fine for short hikes, but don't cross a desert with it! We found the Cool Pooch Bottle sold all by itself in stores, and we also found it sold by thermo-Sac, Inc., in combination with that company's dual-Sac for $16. We like the insulated sleeve - which keeps water bottles cool and gives you a nylon shoulder strap or a Velcro belt-loop option. But we're not fans of the Cool Pooch bottle. It's a clever idea, however: a plastic bottle that enables a dog and a person to share the water, with the person sipping from a straw, and then using that straw to squeeze more water into a separate cup. It's a good idea, but in our opinion it takes a little too much work to make it work, at least, when serving the dog. A person can sip water directly from the bendable straw. To fill up the dog's cup, one bends the tube, pointing it into the cup, and squeezes the bottle to force water into the cup for the dog to drink. Three hands would work better than two: one to bend the tube and two to squeeze the bottle (and then there is the matter of holding your dog's leash at the same time). The bottle's wider mouth makes it easy to fill, but its shape and protruding tube are annoying when the bottle is worn around the neck or over a shoulder. Also, the bottle leaked if it was laid on its side and leaked more when squeezed. On the plus side, it has a capacity of 22 ounces (almost three cups). The Travel Canteen is a plastic version of the good ol' Western movie canteen, except that instead of unscrewing a small cap, the entire top unscrews to reveal a bowl that the dog can drink from. And therein lies the rub. When the canteen arrived, we couldn't get the top off to save our lives! It took several people and several attempts to accomplish, and when we finally got the lid off, we found directions inside, along with a warning not to screw the top on too tightly, and not to leave it where it can get too hot, which contributes to the lid-lock. The instructions indicated that placing the canteen in a refrigerator for a couple of hours would break the seal. This is a pretty serious design flaw for a canteen - what good will it do your dog in the middle of the desert if you can't get the lid off? So, while it holds an ample amount of water (four cups), certainly doesn't leak, and is reasonably comfortable to wear, we'd advise against this one. Oh, and you wouldn't want to share this water, either, once your canine pal slobbers into the bowl. As is often the case, following publication of our review of frozen, raw-meat-based diets, we learned about a number of makers of these diets, of whom we were previously unaware. As a service to our readers, we have listed product information for the companies whose products we just learned about; we'll include them in our frozen food review next year. \u2014\u2014\u2014- Correction on frozen food Also on the topic of our article on frozen diets, please note the following corrections. First, Nature's Menu's diets are formulated to meet or exceed the dog food nutrient profiles of the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). Nature's Menu is one of the few companies whose products we reviewed have been substantiated as complete and balanced for all life stages, even without the addition of supplements or vegetables, which would contribute additional nutrients. Second, we indicated that the product sample we received from Nature's Menu had arrived defrosted. We have confirmed with the company that this was due to a shipping error, where the product was supposed to have been delivered overnight but was not. A company representative has assured us that Natures Menu would gladly reship product at no further expense to any consumer who experienced this problem. Nature's Menu may be reached at (800) 909-7010 or www.naturesmenu.com. We regret any misunderstanding that may have resulted from these errors. \u2014\u2014\u2014- Harness corrections We also heard from a reader who had two comments about the review on harnesses (Harness the Power, May 2002). Bobbi Palsa, of Richmond, Virginia, wrote, \"as a loyal customer of both WDJ and Premier Pet Products, I wanted to point out that your comment regarding Premier's harness that their smallest size is 12 inches should be amended to say that they will make custom sizes on request! My Great Dane, Catherine, is proud to model her custom-made Premier Surefit Harness and finds it perfectly suited for her many public appearances and social engagements!\" Finally, the prices we listed for the Premier harnesses were the wholesale, not the retail prices. The actual range is $14-20. We apologize for any confusion this caused. Generally, I plan a mix of articles in every issue: training, healthcare, and nutrition. I also try to offer a mix of articles geared toward people with decades of canine experience and those that are more helpful to individuals who may be enjoying their first relationships with dogs. I try to make sure that the introductory information I offer is not too basic for the experts in our audience, but I also have a clandestine intent: I hope that you experienced pack leaders will share this information with the relative pups you know. Now, if you read the fine print in this magazine, you know that its a violation of WDJs copyright to actually copy and distribute our content. (Sorry! Since we dont sell ads, we rely on subscription and back issue orders to pay the printer, so to speak.) However, Ive got nothing against your loaning a copy to a friend or relative who is considering getting a dog, or having trouble with a dog. (I do suggest that you write yourself a note to remember to whom you loaned that issue, because chances are, you might need it again in the future!) Pointing your dog-loving friends in the direction of dog-friendly training methods and beneficial healthcare approaches does their dogs and them a huge favor. I wish someone had opened my eyes about commercial dog food, overvaccination, pesticide use, and the fallout of force-based training methods when my 12-year-old Border Collie was a puppy. I often wonder how different his physical and mental health status would be if I had done everything that I know about now with him then. I even wonder if I would have gotten a Border Collie if I knew then what I know now. As much as I love my dog, Im not sure I will choose one of the energetic, often eccentric dogs again. I lucked out with Rupert as far as his energy level goes; hes happy when he gets out to run or play Frisbee with me, but hes also very content in his role as my under-desk dog. However, his idiosyncratic household and social behavior has been, at times, so unpredictable and offbeat, that I have, at times, wished I had a more normal dog. Twelve years ago I didnt know that normalcy is not one of the Border Collies strongest suits! Anyway, two of the articles in this issue, I think, are must-reads for newcomers to the world of dogs. I predict that Pat Millers article on finding the exact kind of dog you want (When Only a Purebred Will Do) and CJ Puotinens article on adding a holistic practitioner to your dogs healthcare team (Coordinating Care) will prevent many people from making common mistakes with their dogs and maybe even save some dogs lives. Pass these articles on, will you? Picture this: Two racing lanes, each with a row of four jumps leading up to mechanized boxes that throw tennis balls. Now imagine two teams, each with four ball-crazed dogs. The dogs are wound so tight that they can barely contain themselves. Their excited barking reaches a deafening pitch. Suddenly, a light flashes green and the dogs are off. The first two dogs on each team race down their row of jumps and, with seemingly effortless motion, each dog banks off the box, hitting a pedal that shoots out the ball. If you blink, you'll miss the ball catch as the dogs race each other back over the jumps. As the first two dogs cross the finish line, the next dogs on each team take off, passing at full speed. In less than 20 seconds, all four dogs on both teams have run the course, with the winning team crossing the finish only a split second ahead. Flyball racing is fast and furious. Most of all, it's a great time for both dogs and people! \"The first time I saw Flyball, I laughed so hard that tears were streaming down my face,\" said Jackie Earnshaw, Flyball enthusiast and owner of Sit Spot Dog Training in Boulder Creek, California. Earnshaw knew she liked Flyball from the start. \"It was sheer joy, watching the dogs have such a good time.\" Lonnie Olson, author of Flyball Racing: The Dog Sport for Everyone, and founder of Dog Scouts of America, also got involved in Flyball racing because it looked like a fun thing to do with dogs. \"Flyball offered fun, friendly, team competition, as an alternative to obedience competition - which was the only dog sport in popularity back in the early 80s.\" What is Flyball Racing? \"Dogs who like to play Flyball don't just simply like it, they love it!\" says Earnshaw, who is teaching Flyball to her Rottweiler, J.B., and recently founded a new Flyball group called the Box Rockers. With group and team names like Ballistics, Mighty Mutts, Box Rockers, Tail Spinners, and Rude Dogs, you know this sport is about honoring a dog's true nature - to run, play, and have a blast. Flyball is an obvious choice for ball-crazed dogs, but even if your dog is not into retrieving, he can be taught to hit the pedal, grab the ball, and race back to you. \"Some dogs who are not natural retrievers learn to retrieve, and then become ball crazed,\" says Olson, who advocates teaching dogs to retrieve using clicker training and backward chaining. \"The whole idea is that even if your dog doesn't like the ball, he will gleefully retrieve to get the reward you are offering.\" Olson teaches Flyball seminars and offers Flyball training at the Dog Scouts of America summer camps. She lives with three Border Collies, a mixed breed that looks like a Karelian Bear Dog, and a cattle dog (her husband's dog) - all of whom enjoy Flyball. But what if you have a dog who is too ball crazy? Flyball training is also a good opportunity to work with dogs with ball \"issues.\" For example, you can teach dogs who like to play keep away with retrieve objects to reliably bring the ball back. And for dogs that are out-of-control retrievers, Flyball is a good avenue to channel their drive, while helping them learn self-control. Plus there's the exercise factor. We've all heard the saying that, \"A tired dog is a good dog.\" Flyball works dogs hard, which may be part of why it appeals to both high-energy dogs and their human roommates. \"It's a wonderful energy burner,\" says Earnshaw. \"It gives the dogs a lot of exercise in a short amount of time, without a huge physical drain on the person.\" Any Dog Can Play Flyball Flyball racing is open to any breed and any size dog. While speed-demon dogs like Border Collies and Jack Russell Terriers are obvious contenders for Flyball, they are not the only dogs that will enjoy and excel at the sport. According to the North American Flyball Association (NAFA, the organization that oversees tournaments in North America), there are more than 170 different breeds (including mixed breeds) registered to race in Flyball tournaments. In fact, NAFA's top pointed dog for 2001 was a mixed breed. Long-legged dogs definitely offer a speed advantage, but smaller dogs, such as small mixed breeds or terriers, fulfill very important roles on a team. Since the smallest dog on the team determines the height of the jumps for the entire team, many teams include one small speedster to augment their speedy strategy. Don't worry; a small dog doesn't have to force a standard size tennis ball into his tiny mouth - in Flyball, smaller sized balls can be used if those are more comfortable for the dog. Any dog that is physically able to run, jump, and bank off the box is a good candidate for Flyball. In addition, because dogs run in close proximity to other dogs - while in a highly aroused state - they must not display aggression toward other dogs. Dog Skills for Flyball: Speed and More Speed A Flyball course is 51 feet long with four jumps, spaced at 10-foot intervals. The first jump is placed 6 feet after the start/finish line, and the Flyball box is placed 15 feet after the fourth jump. The jump height is set at 4 inches lower than the smallest dog, with the minimum height being 8 inches and the maximum being 16 inches. Each dog must run in relay fashion down the jumps, trigger the release of the ball, catch the ball, and then run back over the four jumps. The next dog is released to run the course, but can't cross the start/finish line until the previous dog has returned and crossed the line. If a dog loses the ball or misses a jump, he must run again after the rest of the team has completed their turn. The first team to have all four dogs finish without errors wins. Flyball is obviously about speed - and competitions are won and lost with fractions of seconds. But that doesn't mean your dog (or your team) has to be the fastest of the fast to enjoy competition. In NAFA sanctioned tournaments, teams are divided into divisions so that they compete against other teams of equal abilities. That way every team has a chance at winning an individual race. Dogs who run Flyball can earn points toward Flyball titles. To earn points, the team must complete the race within a certain amount of time (you don't have to win to earn points, only complete the race). If a team's race time is less than 32 seconds, each dog on a team will earn one point. If a team's race time is less than 28 seconds, each dog earns five points. If a team's race time is under 24 seconds, each dog earns 25 points. Titles are awarded for 20 points, 100 points, 500 points, 5,000 points, 10,000 points, 15,000 points, 20,000 points, and 30,000 points. Sometimes, competitions are run for exhibition purposes only, without the team earning points toward a title. In addition, as with Agility and other dog sports, there is a current trend among some Flyball enthusiasts to promote a more casual or \"for fun\" avenue of the sport. In fact, Earnshaw founded the Box Rockers about a year ago because she was interested in having a group that focused more on getting together and having fun than on competition. Flyball Fundamentals Flyball racing seems straightforward - dogs run down the course, get the ball, and run back. But Flyball racing is actually a series of over 25 different behaviors put together. For a dog to run a course with speed and accuracy, each of the elements or behaviors needs to be carefully taught. \"I've seen dogs 'get it' (the basics) in one night of training,\" says Olson when asked how long it takes to train a dog for Flyball. \"However, that's not the best way to train. I use a very systemized method, involving backward chaining, which makes the finished product much more flawless. There's more to it than just learning to jump and learning to press a pedal and get a ball. Everyone should work at their own dog's speed, and not be in a hurry to get to the finished product.\" Earnshaw also emphasizes a systematic approach to training dogs in Flyball. \"It's very important not to rush the dog,\" says Earnshaw. \"Laying a solid foundation from the start is very important.\" Some of the behaviors dogs need to learn include snatching the ball in the air, turning quickly, and returning to you. They need to understand single bounce jumping so they can run with maximum speed. They need to be able to push the pedal on the box, and then to catch the ball as it shoots out. They need to master turning off the box (called a swimmer's turn) and be able to pass other dogs at full speed. When the dogs have these and other behaviors down, they need to learn to put it all together into a run. Olson considers passing the most exciting part of Flyball. \"It is the thing that possibly the uneducated spectators notice the least, but is the biggest part of the sport,\" says Olson. \"Much work goes into creating precision passes.\" The pass is, simply put, the part of the course where one dog crosses the finish line as the next dog on the team begins his run. The two dogs pass each other, often within inches at full speed and without losing concentration or speed. \"The pass (or exchange, as they call it in Canada) will win or lose the race for a team. There's only one thing more exciting for a Flyball enthusiast watching a race than seeing a tight pass, and that's seeing a close finish!\" Olson and Earnshaw both stress that the best way to teach Flyball skills is through positive, motivational methods. For example, clicker training can be used to shape a dog to push the pedal on the box. Backward chaining - teaching the dog the last part of exercise first - is very effective in Flyball. With backward chaining, the dog learns that ultimately his reward comes when he finishes the course. Finding Flyball Flyball is a fast growing dog sport with teams and groups popping up in many areas. But as fast as it's growing, Flyball is still relatively new and it's sometimes difficult to find a group to train with. \"You may have to look hard to find Flyball,\" warns Earnshaw. She also points out that when you find a group, make sure that you are comfortable and that the group offers what you want for your dog. Olson agrees. \"Remember that this is a game. Find a group that uses a behavioral approach to training. But, most importantly, find a group of warm, friendly people that you can relate to. Your fellow team members are going to become like family. You should choose people who are fun, friendly, and fair.\" If you can't find a group in your area, you can follow Earnshaw's example and start your own. Olson's book may also help you get started. Flyball Racing: The Dog Sport for Everyone, offers great tips on building equipment, training the dogs, putting together a team, and getting involved in competition. When asked what she would tell someone who was interested in giving Flyball a try, Earnshaw responded enthusiastically, \"Do it! It's great fun for the dogs and hilarious for the people.\" And, if you're not sure you want to try it with your dog, you may still want to find a Flyball tournament to watch. \"Flyball is my favorite spectator sport,\" says Olson. \"You can keep your baseball and your drag racing. For me, I get excited just thinking about going to a Flyball competition!\" Here are some more resources for finding and playing flyball: flyballdogs.com.

This book provides an excellent introduction to the sport of Flyball with information on building equipment and extensive training tips. A Brief History of Flyball Flyball was invented in the late 1970s. Rumor has it that a man named Herbert Wagner first showed Flyball on Johnny Carson's The Tonight Show and that shortly thereafter, trainers and dog clubs from around the country were building Flyball boxes. The sport quickly grew in popularity and in 1985, the North American Flyball Association (NAFA) was formed by a group of 12 teams from Michigan and Ontario. NAFA standardized the rules, kept records of tournaments, and guided the development of Flyball racing. Flyball is now played throughout North America, Europe, Australia, and other countries. According to Brett Williams, chairman of NAFA, it is still the only governing body for the sport of Flyball in North America. Lonnie Olson, one of the early board members of NAFA, says the sport of Flyball has changed dramatically over the years. According to Olson, Flyball got its name because it involves a mechanical box that throws out a ball for a dog to catch. In the original Flyball, the ball flew up high in the air. The dog would wait for the ball to come down, like an outfielder in baseball waits to catch a fly ball. As the dogs became more intense about the game, they began trying to catch the ball on its way up, instead of waiting for the ball to come back down. This, as you can imagine, became dangerous for the dogs. Olson said that some dogs began bashing their teeth on the \"cup\" that threw the ball. Flyball boxes started changing dramatically at that point, to create greater safety for the dogs. Today, most of the boxes do not have an exposed throwing arm. The ball is propelled out of a hole in the front of the box, and most dogs \"catch\" it before it sees daylight! The technology for timing the races has also changed, says Olson. Historically, judges would time, officiate, and determine the outcomes of races. While judges still officiate, electronic timing systems are usually used in tournaments today. The timing systems not only time the races, but also detect infractions and signal (with red lights) infractions made by false starts or premature passes during racing. Because of changes in the box and other technology, the winning times for Flyball dogs have decreased. Back in 1985, Olson's team was declared the \"Flyball Champions\" with a best time of 32 seconds. Today, many teams run the course in less than 20 seconds. Flyball grows in popularity with every competition and public exhibition. Today, NAFA has more than 300 member clubs with more than 7,000 registered dogs. Mardi Richmond is a freelance writer who lives in Santa Cruz, California. Richmond and her dog, Blue, are just learning the sport of Flyball, but they've already realized that it may offer the most fun a ball-driven dog can have. Mardi also teaches Just for Fun Agility classes and is the co-author of Ruffing It: The Complete Guide to Camping with Dogs. For a machine to work properly, it requires the manufacturer's recommended fuel, lubrication, and maintenance. The same is true for our dogs (and ourselves). In the wild, every creature will find and choose the foods most suitable for its evolutionary development. Our dogs evolved to eat - mostly - other animals. Their strong jaws were designed to crush bones, and their sharp teeth to tear raw meat. So say the innovators who developed so-called \"BARF\" diets for dogs. BARF is an acronym that stands for either Biologically Appropriate Raw Food, or Bones And Raw Food; the terms are used interchangeably. There are thousands of dog guardians who feed their dogs homemade BARF-based diets, buying all the ingredients and preparing their dogs' meals from scratch. People who utilize home-prepared diets are happy to discuss the many benefits of this feeding method for their dogs, including clean, tartar-free teeth; fresh breath; strong bones, muscles, and joints; a glossy coat; a healthy amount of energy and a balanced temperament; and overall vibrant good health. For all the people who have made the leap to a homemade, meat-based diet for their dogs, however, there are many more who would like to make the change, but who are intimidated by the challenge of \"getting it just right.\" Some are afraid of failing to present their dogs with a balanced array of nutrients; others fear bacterial contamination from handling raw meats. It's all here The advent of the commercially prepared, frozen meat-based diet is the answer to these people's prayers. Today, more than a dozen companies offer their versions of the BARF diet, so it's almost as easy as buying and feeding kibble. These products are a convenient, safe way to feed a raw-meat diet. Most of these diets are intended to be fed as a dog's \"complete and balanced diet,\" although a few manufacturers also market supplemental meats and meat-based foods. Some are available only in a local area, while others are available nationally. Some are quite comparable in price to food that you might buy and prepare yourself; others are more expensive, but generally make up for this in the high quality of the ingredients. There are definite differences, however, so it's good to do a little footwork up front to find the company with the product (and pricing) that works best for you. We contacted 15 BARF manufacturers and discovered widely differing philosophies about everything from what should be in the mix to how the food should be shipped to your door. The latter is actually an important point. While a few pet food and health food stores around the country are starting to carry these foods in freezers in their pet food sections, chances are you'll have to mail order your food. We found significant differences in the quality of the shipping packaging, which can make a difference if your food is likely to sit on the porch until someone gets home to put it in the freezer. To ensure that your dog benefits from an improved diet, choose the products that work most comfortably for your budget and your lifestyle. Based on bones The inclusion of fresh, raw bone in a BARF diet is supposed to be key to its resemblance to a dog's evolutionary diet - and to its benefits. But only some of the manufacturers whose products we examined include bone. Some manufacturers utilize beef bone in their mixtures, but others found it too difficult to grind the bone fine enough or to find a reliable source of organic beef bones. These manufacturers use ground chicken bones instead. Some companies add calcium supplements to their products. A final group sells - and recommends that you feed - a separate bone or calcium supplement. Don't forget the veggies All the manufacturers see vegetables as an essential part of a dog's diet, although not all of them include them in their meat mixes. Celeste Yarnall, owner of Celestial Pets, recommends that 40 percent of the dog's diet be carbohydrates from fiber-rich fruits and vegetables, plus a small amount of grain such as slow-cooked oatmeal. The other 60 percent of the diet, she says, should be half low-fat, raw meat or poultry protein, and half bones and supplements. Dr. Ian Billinghurst, one of the earliest proponents of the BARF diet and recent founder of BARFWorld, a new raw dog food company, recommends a different ratio: 60 percent raw, meaty bones; 15 percent crushed vegetables: 10 percent offal (organs and intestines); 5 percent fruit; and the remainder as supplements such as kefir and kelp. Most of the manufacturers mix the veggies into their products. A few offer a choice of meat or meat and vegetable mixes. A third group sticks to straight meat mixes and suggests you add your own veggies. One company (Three Cheers Raw! Raw! Raw!) offers a \"Raw Slaw\" that is a vegetable mix you add to their meat mixes; it looked and smelled so good I wanted to try it myself! Its label also includes suggestions for adding your own fruits and veggies. The other thing to look for is whether the vegetables are fresh or frozen before they're processed. You won't find this information on the label, so if it's important to you, go ahead and ask. Most use fresh and organic fruits and vegetables. Grain isn't for every dog Grain is a small part of the diet in the wild, finding its way into the mix when a wild carnivore eats grain-eating prey. Most of the BARF mixes we looked at were grain-free, but this varies by company and even by product. Check the ingredients to make sure your dog isn't getting something he can't tolerate (all the companies clearly list their ingredients). Don't panic, it's organic Most of the companies whose products we examined use human-grade meats. Some go one step further and use only hormone- and antibiotic-free meats. Organic vegetables and grains may be found in some of the products, too. Holistic veterinarians agree that reducing the toxic burden that our dogs must carry through their lifetime contributes to better health and longevity. Because most dogs are exposed to a plethora of pesticides, herbicides, cleaning agents, and other chemicals in their short lifetimes, holistic practitioners argue that their food, at least, should be as pure as possible. We'd give bonus points to manufacturers who strive to include organic ingredients in their products. Supplemental information Some of the products we examined are guaranteed to be \"complete and balanced,\" meaning a dog eating them would require no further supplements. But some of the companies sell meat-based mixes that are intended to be supplemented. And, of these companies, some make and sell the supplements themselves, and others advise and/or encourage owners to choose and add supplements themselves. \"We like to keep it simple,\" says Tim McCallean of Grandad's Pet Foods. \"We've been doing this for 30 years, and we think it works best when we provide the basics and encourage the dog owner to work with the veterinarian or breeder to determine what supplements to add based on the animal's health and activity.\" The kibble question The principals at two companies, Steve's Real Food for Dogs and Grandad's Pet Foods, believe it's all right to mix the BARF with kibble if that makes it more affordable. They reason that it's better for a dog to have at least part of his diet providing fresh, wholesome nutrients, even if the rest of the diet is less beneficial. Steve's Real Food is even made to look like large kibble nuggets so it mixes easily with dry food. \"Eighty-five percent of our customers mix our food with dry kibble,\" says Steve Brown, of Steve's Real Food. \"We've found that even if just 25 percent to 50 percent of the calories come from our food, the dogs thrive.\" Most of the other manufacturers we talked with felt it was okay to mix their products with the dog's usual kibble or canned food during the introductory phase to help the dog's digestive system adapt, but the goal was to eliminate cooked, processed foods and replace them with a whole, raw food diet. Dr. Ian Billinghurst makes a point in his latest book, The BARF Diet, that carbohydrates, a major constituent of most kibble foods, are not an essential, or even natural part of a dog's diet. He points to research that shows how a carbohydrate-based diet leads to a rise in blood glucose, which in turn causes a pathological rise in insulin. This leads to conditions such as diabetes, obesity, arthritis, and inflammatory illnesses. It may also play a role in promoting cancer, he says. The bottom line Our observations about a dozen commercial raw, frozen diets are charted on the next two pages (see sidebar at end of story). We are aware of a couple more commercial diets, but their makers declined to participate in our survey. If you want more information before you decide if BARF is something you want to try, do contact the manufacturers. A number of them have good research about their diets and all welcome the opportunity to share what they've learned through research and personal experience. Contact information is included in the table on the next page. As with many natural health alternatives, it can take a while for the mainstream medical world to discover and embrace the benefits of something that isn't backed by large companies. WDJ has published many articles on the benefits of home-prepared diets, and will present more soon (see sidebar, \"Raw Information, Past and Future\"). Not long ago, the Miller five-dog pack consisted of two mixed-breed and three purebred dogs - a Scottish Terrier, a Pomeranian, and an Australian Kelpie. Of the purebreds, one was found as a stray, one was adopted from an animal shelter, and one was rehomed from a friend who could no longer keep her. I get several calls every week from people asking me to refer them to a breeder. But it has been more than 20 years since we purchased a dog from a breeder, and I'd wager that I'll go to my grave without ever purchasing another. Decades of work in animal protection made me painfully aware of the easy availability of any breed of dog your heart might desire. The Top Five Caveats of Purebred Dog Buying 1. Research your desired breed carefully to avoid common breed problems. Each breed has certain defects entrenched in its gene pool. 2. Hold your breeder to an unreasonably high standard. Buying a puppy from a less-than-responsible breeder encourages that breeder to continue making contributions to the pet overpopulation problem. If you do buy from a breeder, be sure to buy from one who meets the description above as closely as possible. 3. Don't fall into the \"fad breed\" trap. Learn about the breed that appeals to you - don't get a Jack Russell because of Wishbone, a Border Collie because of \"Babe,\" or a Siberian Husky because you liked \"Snow Dogs.\" All three of those breeds can present above-average challenges to the novice dog owner. 4. Watch out for \"breeder deals.\" Unscrupulous breeders often try to unload their unsold adolescent pups who are now beyond the \"cute\" stage, or their \"used up\" breeding stock, with some story about how the dog was a show prospect who didn't quite make it, and he's willing to give you a really good deal. In fact, these dogs are often very poorly socialized, have had no training whatsoever, and are a real liability to the breeder, who should be paying you to take the dog off his hands. If anything the breeder tells you sounds \"off,\" it probably is. If you do take one of these breeder deals, be prepared to invest in the services of a good behavior consultant. 5. Avoid unreasonable expectations. Not every Collie can grow up to be a Lassie. If your German Shepherd pup's ears never stand tall like they are supposed to, your Bichon Frise never makes it to Madison Square Garden, or your Australian Kelpie is afraid of cows, will you love her despite her flaws, and fulfill your commitment to love and keep her until death do you part? The fact is, purebred dogs are everywhere. You can find them at shelters, in rescue groups, free in the newspaper, running loose in the streets, for sale by breeders, and, unfortunately, in pet stores. There are pros and cons to acquiring your next family member from any of these sources; you can find good dogs from any one of them, but each venue can also supply you with dogs with minor to severe health and behavior problems. Much of the dog breeding industry seems to subscribe to the \"caveat emptor\" philosophy. The average dog owner is very much on her own when it comes to acquiring a new canine companion, and she'd best be very wary, indeed. Let's examine the good, the bad, and the ugly of each source of purebred dogs. Ways to Find Specific Dog Breeds: Pros and Cons Breeders If you have any intention of showing your dog in conformation (or \"breed\" ring), she must have registration papers. If you want to be successful competing in the breed ring, you must have a very good quality dog with papers. There are good breeders who sell good quality dogs and bad breeders who sell unsound and unhealthy dogs. Both sell puppies with papers. Sadly, the irresponsible breeders abound, while the good ones are scarce. After more than 30 years of experience working in and around animal shelters - and having seen untold thousands of mixed-breed and purebred dogs euthanized for lack of homes - I have developed a pretty stringent definition of a \"responsible breeder.\" In my opinion, an ethical breeder produces puppies solely for the purpose of improving the breed; her purpose is to attempt to come up with the best dogs she can, not to make money. In a good breeding program, sire and dam are thoroughly screened for any health problems known to be common to that breed, and pairings are based on a complete awareness and understanding of how one dog's qualities complement the other's. Dogs of questionable temperament or health are never bred, and dogs of breeding quality are shown and titled in conformation and at least one competitive canine sport, to demonstrate that they have brains as well as beauty. The conscientious breeder provides extra nutrition for the dam before and during pregnancy to ensure that she and the puppies are all healthy, and doesn't hesitate to seek whatever veterinary care is recommended during gestation, whelping, and puppy development. Once the puppies are born, they are kept in a clean environment and socialized to the extreme - beginning at about four weeks of age - in order to prevent any possibility of behavior problems related to the puppies' unfamiliarity with other people and the world around them. Good breeders even begin training their pups before they place them in new homes - giving them a head start on good manners and helping them to be comfortable in crates and away from the pack even before they leave their littermates. A conscientious breeder screens new homes carefully, and does not just sell puppies to the first buyer who arrives with check in hand. If, upon direct questioning, the buyer admits he is new to the breed, she educates him about all aspects of that type of dog, not just the warm-fuzzy qualities. Good breeders just don't sell puppies before the age of eight weeks, and have pet-quality pups spayed and neutered prior to placement (juvenile spay/neuter techniques now allow eight-week-old puppies to be safely sterilized - see \"Spaying and Neuturing Information\". These breeders will be happy to give you a number of names and phone numbers of people who have bought her dogs; call these people and ask whether they are happy with their dogs' health and temperament. Pay attention if they say they no longer have the dogs! A good breeder might insist on visiting the buyer's home to inspect the pup's intended environment, and may refuse to sell a puppy to a home that doesn't have a safely fenced yard. A good breeder rarely sells two pups to the same buyer, knowing full well what a difficult challenge it is to raise two baby dogs together without behavior complications. Good breeders also rarely advertise in the newspaper, since they have taken care to have prospective buyers for any pups they produce long before the breeding takes place, and they never sell to pet stores. Finally, a responsible breeder makes a commitment to always take back any pups that she has produced at any time during that dog's life, if the new owners must give them up for any reason whatsoever. As you can see, there are relatively few breeders who meet my admittedly stringent criteria. If more breeders were of this type, there certainly wouldn't be so many purebred and crossbred dogs available from other sources, such as shelters and rescues. A breeder who does anything less contributes actively to the serious problem of pet overpopulation in this country. On the positive side, a truly good breeder is a treasure. She produces healthy puppies of exceptionally good quality, provides a valuable education to those fortunate enough to purchase from her, is a wonderful resource for her buyers once the puppies have gone home, and becomes a lifetime friend to her puppies and their new families. Of course, breeders are not the only source for purebred dogs, and purebred dogs don't have to be registered in order to compete in many canine sports. Many organizations offer competitions and titles for mixed-breed and unregistered purebred dogs - they are more interested in performance than pedigree. Even the American Kennel Club, the biggest stickler for \"purebred-only\" policies, will issue \"Indefinite Listing Privileges\" to dogs who appear to be purebred, even if registration papers are not available. A dog with an ILP number may enter all AKC-sanctioned competitions, such as obedience and agility, except for the breed ring, and an ILP dog can earn all AKC sports competition titles. So, read on to learn more about additional sources for purebred dogs! Animal Shelters Most people are astonished to discover how many purebred and crossbred dogs and puppies end up in our nation's animal shelters. Over the past three decades I have visited and worked in shelters around the country, and not once did I fail to find purebred dogs in the adoption kennels. There are lots of good reasons to adopt shelter dogs. First, you may well save a life. At many shelters, adoption dogs have a limited time to find a home before overcrowding forces animal care staff to make euthanasia selections. You might also save money - many adoption fees include a complete package of vaccinations, license, ID tags, and spay/neuter that cost far less than the price of the actual services from a private veterinarian - not to mention the initial cost of a puppy from a private source. While some dogs end up in shelters because of behavior problems, most do not. Some have minor, easily addressed behaviors or health issues that the previous owner couldn't be bothered to fix, while many have no problems at all - they may simply have wandered off and their owners didn't care enough to come look or pay impound fees. Still other \"perfect\" pooches get left at shelters because their owners are going through lifestyle changes that don't include Fido. You do need to be careful when adopting from a shelter. If your local shelter has a deserved reputation for harboring distemper and parvovirus germs, you will want to range farther afield and adopt from one with a good disease control program. Also, some shelters also do a better job than others at screening their canine adoption candidates and matching them to appropriate homes. You may need the help of your favorite dog trainer to find the shelter diamonds in the rough. The best shelters offer breed match-up services. You can go in and get approved as a prospective adopter and be put in their files for a particular breed. When a dog of your chosen breed comes in looking for a home, they can call you to come see it. It may take a little patience to wait for the right dog to come along, but it's well worth the satisfaction of knowing you have given a shelter dog a second chance at life. Breed Rescues In the last couple of decades, animal rescue groups have gained high visibility for their work. Today, there is a rescue group for every breed imaginable as well as for crossbreeds and mixed-breeds, and there are rescue groups in every community. Rescue dogs come from a variety of sources, including shelters, breeders, private homes, Greyhound racetracks, and law enforcement actions against puppy mills and hoarders (animal collectors). Like shelters and breeders, rescue groups may also range from very good to very bad. Good rescue groups offer dogs who are fully vetted, already spayed and neutered, and evaluated for behavior problems. They fully disclose any known or anticipated behavior challenges, and screen prospective adopters. A good rescuer is an expert in her breed, and will make sure you are prepared to manage the idiosyncrasies of your chosen breed. Beware of rescuers who develop a hoarder syndrome. Animal lovers who do rescue work are sometimes unable to recognize when their responsibilities have come to outweigh their resources. Steeped in their mission to save lives, they may end up rescuing more animals than they can care for, or take animals who require far more rehabilitation than they, or the average adopter, can provide. Be prepared to pay an adoption fee for your rescued dog. Good rescue groups make a significant commitment of resources to rehabilitate and place their wards. They are largely dependent on donations, and your adoption fees will help defray some of their operating and animal care expenses. Newspaper Ads Good breeders do not advertise in local newspapers; they don't have to. Backyard breeders and puppy mills do frequently advertise there, and are not a recommended source for your new family member. You can, however, find your ideal dog in the paper if you are careful, and if you can resist the temptation to fall for the first furry face you see. Look for a private owner who must place an individual dog for some reason - usually a lifestyle change, or a sober realization that the addition of a dog to the family was an unfortunate mistake. Be sure to take the time to evaluate the dog thoroughly before you take him home, and have a clear understanding with the owner about your ability to return him should he not work out for you. Pet Stores The only positive aspect of purchasing a puppy from a pet store is that you rescue that doggie in the window - that's a good thing for that individual pup. However, while some people are perfectly happy with their pet store purchases, the risks related to buying pet store puppies so greatly outweigh the single good that we urge you to never even let the thought cross your mind. For starters, when you purchase a pet store puppy, you support the horrendous puppy mill industry. Every dollar you spend to rescue that beguiling face in the window goes to produce, market, and sell more puppies who are raised in substandard conditions. By \"freeing up\" that puppy's cage, in essence, you place the pet store owner's order for more puppies, to be produced by mothers who are nothing more than breeding machines to the puppy farmer. Pay no attention to the store manager's reassurances that their puppies come from \"responsible breeders.\" No responsible breeder sells puppies to pet stores. None. Every breed of dog is burdened with the potential for specific diseases or medical conditions; when genes pass along traits for a specific coat type and color, conformation, and temperament, they also transmit the parent's potential for hip dysplasia, heart defects, cancer, etc. The parents of pet store puppies are unlikely to have had any screening for the genetic defects - they may, in fact, be castoffs who actually suffer from the inherited conditions - so the chances are far greater that your pup will suffer from one or more of these debilitating defects in his lifetime. The puppies and their parents may have missed out on some important health care practices, such as good basic nutrition and deworming. The sooner people stop buying pet store puppies, the sooner pet stores will stop selling them, and the sooner puppy mills and other irresponsible breeders will start going out of business. Finders Keepers Of course, you could always buy into the \"No two alike\" philosophy of dog-keeping. With this guide, and no preconceived idea of who we want our next dog to be, we are always open to our next serendipitous canine discovery. If we had our hearts set on a particular breed, we would have missed the opportunity to keep Dubhy, the piano-playing, skateboard-riding Scottish Terrier who wandered into our family last winter and has amused us with his no-fear attitude and Gaelic sense of humor ever since. Nor would we have had the joy of sharing our lives with Josie, the Terrier mix who crossed our paths 15 years ago during a cockfighting investigation, and who has been my teacher and guide on our positive training path ever since. Get the Right Dog for the Job There are 150 breeds of dogs eligible for registration with the American Kennel Club (AKC), the best-known breed registry in this country, and hundreds more recognized by other registries. When planning for your next four-footed family member, consider what purposes the dogs have been bred for, as well as the environment you can provide for him. The AKC assigns their recognized breeds into seven groups, based on the uses for which the breeds were originally developed. They also have a Miscellaneous Class for breeds still under consideration for recognition. Other than Miscellaneous, however, the group that your desired breed falls into can tell you a lot about his likely characteristics. SPORTING GROUP These are the \"bird dogs\" - setters, spaniels, pointers, and retrievers - commonly used by hunters to seek out and retrieve \"game\" birds such as ducks, geese, pheasant, grouse, etc. They tend to be alert, have a lot of energy, show an affinity for birds, and be exceptionally oral - the retrievers especially. They need lots of exercise, and are bred to work very closely with humans, so tend to be pretty attentive to people. HOUND GROUP These are hunting dogs who either use their noses (scent hounds) or their eyes (sight hounds) to follow their prey. Both classes of hound are bred to take off after prey without worrying about where their humans are; their natural tendency is to be more environmentally-focused than human-focused. They are perfectly trainable, but the handler must work harder to convince the hounds that it is worth their while to play the training game. The scent hounds (Beagles, Foxhounds, etc.) tend to be very vocal, as they are bred to \"sound off\" when tracking prey. WORKING GROUP These dogs have been bred to perform such duties as guarding, pulling carts and sleds, and water rescue. The Mastiff is in this group, as are the sheep-guarding breeds, Rottweiler, Newfoundland, Husky, and several others. They are generally large, with a protective and somewhat independent nature, so we ought not be surprised that they can find themselves in grave trouble when neglected. Many of them (sled dogs excepted) tend to more placid than lots of other breeds. Despite its size, a Bernese Mountain Dog, for example, may be a better choice for apartment living than the diminutive but energetic and often vocal Jack Russell Terrier. TERRIER GROUP These feisty, energetic dogs range in size from fairly small, as in the Norfolk or Cairn Terrier, to the large Airedale Terrier. Because their ancestors were bred to hunt and kill vermin, terriers typically have little tolerance for other animals, sometimes includ ing other dogs. They tend to be known as the group with an \"attitude,\" and are quite likely to take offense if you try to force them into compliance with your wishes. TOY GROUP These little guys are born with genetically enhanced lap instincts. If well-trained and socialized, these wonderful canines can make great companions, as well as therapy and service dogs. If not, they can be little terrors. Because of their tiny size, they are generally easy to control, so many owners do tend to skip training and overlook bad manners. Unfortunately, this has given some toy dogs a reputation for jumping up, \"yapping,\" and other annoying but easily prevented habits. NON-SPORTING GROUP This is AKC's diverse group of dogs who don't fit into any other category. There is no consistency here - they range from the Bichon Frise to the Chow-Chow. You will need to do more indepth research to determine if one of the Non-Sporting dogs is right for you. HERDING GROUP As the name implies, these dogs were bred to herd livestock on behalf of their slower human handlers. It stands to reason, then, that they have an above-average attraction to things that move (and a related, sometimes uncontrollable desire to nip aforesaid moving things). They also tend to be vocal, and possess high energy levels. Like the Sporting breeds, they do have an inbred tendency to work well with humans - it is no accident that Border Collies, Shetland Sheepdogs, and Australian Shepherds are top scorers in competitive obedience and agility. Their strong herding instincts, however, may make them ill-suited to live with children unless well-supervised; their natural desire to chase and nip can get them into trouble. These brief cameos of the various breed groups don't even begin to scratch the surface. If you are in the market for a new dog, give serious thought to who you want her to be - don't fall for the first furry face you see. Then, research the breed thoroughly to be sure you're prepared to accept the inherent behavioral tendencies that are likely to come with her. If it's too late for you to do pre-purchase research, at least read more about the dog who already shares your home, so that you understand better why he does what he does, rather than getting angry at him for being who he is. Understanding is the first step toward modifying unwanted behavior - anger just gets in the way of training. Finally, remember that just because a breed has certain tendencies doesn't mean that all members of the breed act that way. If your heart is set on a highenergy Border Collie who will win herding trials and agility titles, remember that some Border Collies are calm and some aren't the least bit interested in sheep. Spend enough time observing the potential candidates to make sure you get a high-energy sheep-magnet. A Word About \"Registration Papers\" There are a number of organizations that register various breeds of dogs. The American Kennel Club and United Kennel Club are the most widely recognized and respected in this country, but even AKC and UKC registration papers are no guarantee of quality, or of mental or physical soundness. In fact, among unscrupulous individuals in the industry, paper-swapping and falsification is a not-uncommon practice. Say a litter of three Jack Russell Terrier puppies is born. An unscrupulous breeder can register a litter of five, and then have two extra sets of papers to apply to any spare Jack Russells who happen to come along. Pedigrees can be even more confusing. A pedigree is a dog's \"family tree,\" and tells a knowledgeable dog person a great deal about a dog's breeding. Backyard breeders will point triumphantly to champions listed in red ink several generations back in a puppy's pedigree and advertise puppies from \"champion lines.\" The average puppy buyer doesn't realize that the absence of red ink in the most recent two or three generations of the pedigree speaks volumes about the lack of attention to quality in the current breeding program. Pat Miller is WDJ's Training Editor and the author of The Power of Positive Dog Training. We're all looking for the mythical \"perfect veterinarian,\" right? Most animal guardians I've known would gladly pledge their undying support to a veterinary practitioner who could offer high-tech diagnostic tools and skills; a deep knowledge of pathology, nutrition, and conventional medicine; and the ability and willingness to utilize appropriate alternative and complementary therapies. Unfortunately, this \"perfect vet\" is an extremely rare find. Most of us - people who embrace both conventional medicine as well as herbs, chiropractic, acupuncture, and other holistic medicines - have to resort to \"building\" our perfect veterinarian. Most of us do this by assembling a team of healthcare providers, each of whom is consulted for diagnosis or treatments that he or she is best able to provide. This is, admittedly, a less-than-perfect solution, because sometimes these gifted professionals strongly disagree about \"what's best,\" and you and your dog are caught in the middle. For example, what happens when your brilliant and local conventional practitioner - the person you rely on for routine examinations and emergency care - is adamant about administering annual vaccinations to all her patients (and you are opposed to them)? Or when the same veterinarian wants you to put your elderly Labrador on Science Diet's anti-arthritis food and Rimadyl - but you know your dog is better-served by a raw diet, nutritional supplements, and monthly acupuncture treatments? I've heard many stories from people who use holistic practices and get tired of being pressured by their conventional veterinarians to (over) vaccinate, use (sometimes harmful) drug therapy as a first (not last) resort, or feed their dogs a commercial (low-quality) kibble. Sometimes, in an effort to find more sympathetic veterinarians, these caring guardians replaced their conventional primary practitioner with a holistic veterinarian - only to be disappointed by this professional's resistance to useful conventional medicine! In order to best utilize a \"team\" or network of healthcare providers for our dogs, it's best to be aware of some of the potential pitfalls, as well as the benefits, of this approach. The following experiences clearly illustrate both. Finding her own path Christine Swingle, who raises West Highland White Terriers in Connecticut, has spent years contemplating this problem. She became interested in holistic medicine in 1996, when Summer, one of her cherished Westies, was misdiagnosed by a veterinarian who had treated Swingle's dogs for decades. Two weeks later, despite intensive care from specialists at a highly regarded animal hospital in Massachusetts, Summer died. Swingle turned her grief into determination to find a better way to keep her Westies healthy. Guided by Juliette de Bairacli Levy's Complete Herbal Handbook for the Dog and Cat, Swingle began feeding her dogs a well- balanced raw diet. \"As I continued my research,\" she says, \"I realized how ignorant and isolated I had been all my life. Treating the whole patient instead of specific conditions was a giant shift for me, especially because I had been a vet tech for 18 years. Until then, I believed 100 percent in conventional allopathic medicine.\" In addition to changing their diet, Swingle stopped vaccinating her puppies and adult dogs and discarded all flea, tick, and heartworm chemicals. She and her sister soon visited a well-known holistic clinic. \"My sister's 11-year-old dog had cancer,\" she explains, \"and she wanted to avoid harsh treatments like chemotherapy and radiation. By comparing notes with other patients, I discovered that everyone who goes there receives the same standard list of diagnostics and treatment, regardless of the patient's age, condition, history, or illness. Looking back, I think the clinic provided more false hope than anything else. My sister spent thousands of dollars on holistic remedies, but her dog died within a month. \"My own dog, Emma, who did not have cancer, did not respond to the clinic's one-size-fits-all protocol, either. Ironically, it was allopathic medicine that helped Emma the most, not by healing or curing anything but by improving her quality of life.\" Then Swingle discovered homeopathy and began consulting a veterinary homeopath. \"Homeopathy uses extremely dilute solutions of natural substances like plants or minerals to stimulate the body's healing forces,\" she explains. \"It's the opposite of allopathic medicine because instead of suppressing or attacking symptoms, homeopathy treats 'like with like.' That is, the remedy prescribed for an illness is the remedy that would normally produce the same symptoms as the disease. This way of stimulating the body's healing mechanism made perfect sense to me. The Westies were thriving, and life was good - or so I thought.\" In 2001, Swingle took her champion-quality female, Hannah, to her homeopathic veterinarian for spay surgery. Tragically, there were complications during surgery, and Hannah ended up bleeding to death in her guardian's arms, right there in the veterinarian's surgery. \"I had assumed that whether allopathic or homeopathic, all veterinarians have the same fundamental training and set up their practices with the same modern equipment and trained staff,\" says Swingle. \"I did not realize that some homeopathic veterinarians cannot see the light beyond the medicine they practice, even when it means the patient's life or death. In Hannah's case, a homeopathic remedy was not going to correct her blood loss. I knew that, and I erroneously assumed that the vet did, too.\" Now Swingle is building a network of healthcare providers for her dogs, including a local allopathic veterinarian who handles emergencies and a veterinary homeopath whose office is a two-hour drive away. The right person for the job Like Christine Swingle, Nora Hayes has had good and bad experiences with holistic medicine. Four years ago, her eight-year-old Golden Retriever, Buster, led an active, healthy life. \"Then his stride began to break down while walking,\" she says. \"Soon it grew more pronounced and turned into a definite hobble.\" Hayes' local veterinarian diagnosed a minor injury and prescribed rest and steroids. At the same time, Hayes increased Buster's visits to a holistic veterinarian, who also examined the dog and diagnosed the problem as a bruised rib. Despite conventional care, chiropractic adjustments, and acupuncture, Buster's condition only worsened. Finally, the first veterinarian referred Buster to a neuromuscular specialist. \"This man took one glance as we walked through the door,\" Hayes recalls, \"and announced that Buster had bone cancer.'\" A few minutes later, X-rays confirmed that diagnosis by showing a leg bone pocked with holes like Swiss cheese. \"I was shocked,\" says Hayes. \"I thought the only question to be settled was whether his limp was due to a bruised rib, pulled muscle, or injured tendon. No one had suggested cancer, and it hadn't crossed my mind.\" Hayes had to decide whether to put Buster down, amputate his leg, or do something else. \"I was completely unprepared,\" she says. \"I hadn't had time to consider the different options, and I didn't even know what they were.\" Because Buster's normal chest X-rays and overall condition made him an excellent candidate for amputation, which the specialist said would give him at least a year of pain-free life, Hayes agreed to immediate surgery. However, Buster's recovery was interrupted by repeated relapses as the cancer spread to his ribs, and he soon died. \"Throughout this ordeal, I was upset, disappointed, and confused,\" says Hayes. \"Circumstances had put me in a position for which I had no experience or training, and that was very difficult. I had to act like a general contractor, coordinating the efforts of veterinarians who did not work together and who practiced very different types of medicine.\" Like Swingle, Hayes learned from her painful experience. She studied the connection between diet and cancer, consulted with holistic practitioners, searched the Web for information, and put her dogs on a raw diet. \"Neither of my younger dogs has the hot spots, allergies, or chronic ear infections that plagued Buster and his companion, Daphne, who died of cancer a year after Buster did,\" she reports. Both Hayes and Swingle take their dogs to local veterinarians who practice conventional medicine but who understand and accept their clients' use of alternative or holistic therapies. \"My vet and I had a heart-to-heart talk after Buster died,\" says Hayes. \"I still take my dogs to her and I have confidence in her care. What changed is that I am much more involved in the care my boys receive, and she in turn has become more open to my suggestions.\" Lines of communication Not everyone is comfortable asking questions, making suggestions, challenging the authority of veterinarians who are used to deciding how animals will be treated, or seeking a second opinion. \"These things get easier with practice,\" says trainer Nancy Strouss, of Valley Cottage, New York. \"I have always been direct with vets if I feel the need for a second opinion. If I already know who I want to go see, I just tell them that's where I'm going. But often I will ask them who they would recommend for the type of problem I'm dealing with. None of my vets have ever had a problem with this,\" she says. \"I simply wouldn't deal with a practitioner whose ego gets in the way of his or her concern for the patient. Most of the vets I consult work together by forwarding records and sharing information. I always report back to my primary vets about second-opinion consultations because I want to know what they think and because they are often involved in continuing treatment.\" Veterinary chiropractor Sue Ann Lesser, DVM, who conducts monthly clinics in five Northeastern states, agrees that communication is the key to successful healthcare. \"The best thing you can do,\" she says, \"is keep everyone informed. I'm always happy to work with other members of the team, whether they're allopathic vets, holistic practitioners, acupuncturists, herbalists, or anything else. Many dog trainers have an excellent eye for lameness and sports medicine problems, and I value their input, too.\" Several of Dr. Lesser's veterinary colleagues refer patients to her when they can't solve a problem using conventional diagnostics and treatment. \"Their test results and X-rays are valuable for ruling out whatever isn't causing the problem,\" she says. \"Likewise, if I think a dog's lameness might be caused by a fracture or bone chip, I'll refer the dog back for an X-ray, or if I think it might be Lyme disease, I'll send the dog back for testing. I strongly believe that the more information you can collect and share, the better it is for everyone, especially your dog.\" Building the team It's one thing to know that holistic practitioners exist and another to find the right ones for you and your dog. One place to start is the American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association, which can refer you to practitioners in your area. Local trainers, animal shelters, dog clubs, health food stores, breeders, friends, groomers, and the Internet are other sources of information and referrals. \"I strongly suggest that people call to set up an interview appointment with a potential holistic or homeopathic veterinarian before deciding whether to take a dog there for treatment,\" says Christine Swingle. \"Ask lots of questions about the vet's education, training, length of practice, and medical philosophy. Good topics to raise are home-prepared diets, vaccinations, and chemical flea, tick, and heartworm products.\" Swingle also recommends that potential clients also discuss financial matters; because of the advanced and specialized education that holistic veterinarians have paid for, their rates are often more than those of conventional veterinarians. \"I would ask, 'How much does an office visit cost, and what are typical treatment costs?' I have received quotes from veterinary homeopaths for $75 an hour up to $250 an hour and more. The first visit is typically longer than follow-up visits because it involves taking a medical history, and that adds to the expense,\" says Swingle. \"Then I would ask exactly what they do and don't do. In other words, do they perform surgeries such as spaying or neutering? Do they do other operations? If so, do they have a well-equipped surgical room including a gas anaesthetic machine? Do they have IV fluids, oxygen, and other life support if an animal needs it during or after surgery? The best way to avoid tragedies is to ask questions ahead of time - don't assume anything.\" Then there's the matter of finding or training a conveniently located, affordable, open-minded conventional veterinarian. \"It can be a challenge,\" says Swingle, \"to find a local allopathic veterinarian who accepts your use of other disciplines. Many veterinary homeopaths, veterinary chiropractors, and other holistic practitioners do not draw blood, take X-rays, or perform other lab tests. It may be necessary to find a local vet to do these things in support of a medical philosophy he or she might not understand.\" Some conventional veterinarians are simply not comfortable with such an arrangement. \"No practitioner has all the answers,\" says Dr. Lesser, \"just as no medical discipline has all the answers. If you're dealing with a veterinarian who is particularly contrary, then maybe you need to look elsewhere for someone who's less territorial and more of a team player. Don't be shy; there are plenty of veterinarians. If you ask around, you'll find one who will support your right to choose your dog's treatment.\" Nora Hayes thinks of her local vet as a general practitioner or family doctor who takes care of emergencies and routine matters, while she uses holistic practitioners and medical specialists for anything that is not routine. \"In that case,\" she says, \"I believe the right thing to do is trust your hunches, call in the cavalry, and don't worry about hurting anyone's feelings. It's your dog's life, and a good vet will understand.\" Holistic care in perspective Holistic medicine is exciting because it often works spectacularly well, correcting multiple problems while improving overall health. But it's important to keep everything in perspective, suggests Swingle. \"Holistic medicine is often represented in books and magazines as a cure for everything, and some of its practitioners deliver an optimistic prognosis no matter what. That isn't always realistic,\" she says. \"It's a mistake to think of holistic medicine as a magic pill. Learning about nutrition, medicinal herbs, flower essences, massage, acupuncture, chiropractic, homeopathy, and other therapies used by holistic practitioners as well as the conditions that affect your dog and its breed will help you stay objective. There are many resources to learn from, plus chat lists on the Internet that can put you in touch with others who have knowledge and experience. There is no excuse for being in the dark about canine health. It is up to all of us to know just as much as we can so that we can participate in meaningful discussions with all of the members of our veterinary team.\" Nora Hayes agrees. \"Too often, in my opinion,\" says Hayes, \"holistic or alternative practitioners defensively criticize the disregard that mainstream vets have for their disciplines, but they don't acknowledge the important role conventional medicine can play when an animal's life is at stake. \"Until the disciplines learn to talk together and practice cooperatively, I have to be my animal's advocate. This means learning as much as I can and intervening in the treatment as necessary. This might mean deciding against a conventional treatment in favor of something holistic, but it might also mean deciding against a holistic therapy in favor of something conventional.\" What to fix first Dr. Lesser practiced conventional veterinary medicine for 10 years before studying chiropractic, acupuncture, and homeopathy, which she considers the foundations of holistic medicine. \"At a recent conference,\" she says, \"I heard someone explain how these therapies work together, and I think it's a great description: Chiropractic is like the overall or coarse adjustment on a television; it fixes the structure. Acupuncture is the fine tuning; it improves focus by fixing the energy flow. Homeopathy, which is also a type of energy medicine but one that's more involved with the patient's constitution, is that last click that brings the picture in crystal-clear. \"In my opinion, that's the ideal sequence to follow. First, fix subluxations with chiropractic adjustments so the body moves correctly. Once the basic structure is aligned, the body is better able to respond to acupuncture's release of energy blockages, and when energy is flowing as it should, the body is better able to respond to correctly chosen homeopathic remedies. Of course, underlying everything is nutrition. Whenever I see that this sequence of treatments isn't working, I know the diet needs fixing. As soon as the dog's nutrition improves, everything else follows.\" Chiropractic, acupuncture, and homeopathy are medical specialties, but anyone can practice the basics of holistic medicine by improving a dog's diet or learning how to use a few safe, effective medicinal herbs, nutritional supplements, flower essences, or basic massage techniques. \"These simple steps,\" says Dr. Lesser, \"lay the groundwork for a lifetime of improved healthcare.\" Staying organized Initial consultations vary according to discipline, and the questions asked by a veterinary homeopath are likely to be quite different from those asked by an allopathic veterinarian or a veterinary chiropractor. But all practitioners are likely to inquire about your dog's health history. \"Sometimes understanding a dog's condition involves detective work,\" says Nancy Strouss. \"Has the dog had this symptom before? If so, when? What was the treatment, and did it work? What else was happening at the time?\" These questions are easier to answer if you keep health records in a single location, such as a file folder or notebook. Strouss keeps track of all her dogs in a separate appointment book that she uses just for them. \"I write down everything that goes on in their lives,\" she explains, \"including where I took them for a long walk and anything unusual that they ate or did. If one of the dogs starts limping on her left front leg after playing ball, I write it down. In addition, both of my vets keep excellent, detailed records; they measure and thoroughly describe all of my dogs' lumps and bumps so they know right away if anything has changed.\" Coordinating your dog's healthcare by assembling a team of holistic and conventional practitioners requires effort, but this investment of time, energy, and resources can pay a lifetime of health dividends. The harness is routinely used for certain canine activities such as carting, mushing, tracking, and guiding the disabled. It is also an important accessory for the canine seat belt, since it's not safe to restrain your dog by his collar in a moving vehicle. Oddly, there isn't much talk about the value of the harness as a basic positive training tool. With all the justifiable concern about the risk to a dog's throat from pressure, or worse, jerks on a collar, it would seem that harnesses might find greater favor with positive trainers. There are a number of advantages to using a harness. In addition to the total lack of pressure placed on the dog's vulnerable trachea by a good harness, it is almost impossible for a dog to slip out of a well-designed, properly-fitted harness. Because it distributes pressure across the dog's entire chest, a harness is also far less likely than a collar to contribute to spinal misalignments, particularly for dogs who have a tendency to lunge and hit the end of the leash with their full weight. Thus, they are the tools of choice for dogs who do suffer from spinal problems and/or damaged tracheas. Finally, if you use a canine seat belt, getting into the car with Rover doesn't require the additional step of donning an extra piece of equipment. There are disadvantages to using a harness, however. Putting a harness on a dog can be a frustrating experience, especially if he doesn't cooperate. It is certainly more comfortable for a dog to pull on the leash when he's wearing a harness, since the pressure is distributed over a wider area, so you may need to spend additional time working on polite leash-walking behaviors. Plus, a large, strong dog in a harness might easily drag a small or not-strong handler right along behind him. In addition, harnesses can rub and cause wear and tear on canine coats, even matting on long-haired dogs, and a poorly fitted harness may chafe the dog under his front legs, and even result in sores. Finally, fitting can be a challenge. The best harnesses are generally not available from local pet supply stores, which means you may have to order them online or from a catalog. Measurements for harnesses are usually taken around the dog's barrel, right behind the elbows, and ideally, an adjustable harness will fit dogs within a given measurement range so you can select the size most likely to fit your dog. Like most training tools, harnesses may be appropriate for some dogs and not for others. If you are looking for a way to prevent Rover's walk from being a pain in the neck for him, a harness just might be the ticket. What we're looking for Ideally, a harness would be made of a soft but strong material, with sturdy fittings, designed so that it's simple to figure out and put on the dog. Harnesses generally consist of several different straps (chest, barrel, back, and sternum), and these pieces should be stitched and/or held together with reliably strong metal or plastic hardware. All the various straps should be easily adjustable to allow for fitting to an almost infinite variety of canine shapes and sizes. When properly adjusted, straps should lie flat on the dog's body, and the hardware should be positioned in places where the pieces are least likely to rub - that is, not under the armpits - or prevent a dog from lying down or sitting comfortably. Ideally, harnesses allow an option for attaching a leash either at the back (above the dog's midsection) or behind the neck (for dogs who may need a little more control) without putting pressure on the dog's throat. We would expect to pay a reasonable price for a well-made harness, and having a choice of colors and designs would be icing on the cake. There are literally dozens of harnesses on the market, and we couldn't test them all. However, for comparison, we did try to purchase a wide variety of the ones that appeared to meet our criteria. Top picks in harnesses The Premier Surefit Harness, made by Premier Pet Products of Richmond, Virginia, offered all of our most desirable features, as well as one unique to this brand - the ability to unbuckle the harness from both sides. This means you can put it on your dog without having to lift up and thread through one of his front legs, and you can easily remove the harness from either side. This harness is made of top quality materials and has five adjustment locations - on the sternum strap (underneath the dog's chest) and on each side of the barrel and neck, and the adjustment buckles are easy to use. In addition, it offers two attachment points for a leash: behind the neck and farther down the back. Premier is known for producing high quality products, so it didn't surprise us that we found very little to dislike about their harness. Our only complaint is that the minimum size is 12 inches, and some young toy breed pups might need smaller than that. The Quick-Klip Adjustable Harness, made by Leather Brothers of Conway, Arkansas, is a solid, nicely-made, reasonably-priced no-frills harness, although more costly than our top-choice harness. The nonadjustable sternum strap is a mild drawback (the harness offers a total of three adjustment points), but it is a serviceable product. White Pine Outfitters, of Iron River, Wisconsin, makes consistently high quality products and its Tracking Harness (not limited to use for tracking) is no exception. It was, however, the highest-priced harness we found on the market, so be prepared to pay a little more for its quality materials. We especially love the exceptionally soft web material that White Pines uses in its products. One note - there seems to be an unwieldy excess length of material in the sternum strap - probably to allow for maximum adjustment. Once the harness is fitted properly to your dog, you will need to cut off the excess strap and heat-seal the end. The harness adjusts in four places, and we found the adjustment hardware to be easy to move. Middle-ranked The Non-Restrictive Harness made by Lupine, Inc., of Conway, New Hampshire, is a workable harness, but one that offers less comfort, and is at the high end of the price range. It does come with a lifetime guarantee, even if chewed, so if your dog is a termite when it comes to canine accessories, this product might have greater value for you! We found the nylon material to be strong but a little stiff, which makes it less comfy for the dog and more difficult to adjust; it required a little more effort to slide the somewhat inflexible material through the three adjustment points. It does, however, offer both front and rear attachments for a leash, and colorful pattern choices. The Adjustable Nylon Harness made by Scott Pet Products of Rockville, Indiana, is our favorite of the lower-end harnesses - easy to adjust, made of reasonably solid materials, with lots of color choices. It's just not comparable to the higher-quality products due to its slightly stiffer and thinner nylon material. The harness has two leash attachment points and three adjustment points; unfortunately, one of the buckles is located where the dog must lie on it. The Adjustable Harness made by Coastal Pet Products, of Alliance, Ohio, is a more middle-of-the-road, medium quality harness with limited features. In our opinion, it's serviceable, but not top-of-the-line. The harness has three adjustment points, and hardware works easily. There is one buckle that is positioned underneath the dog if he lies down. Not our dog's harness We were amazed that we found this much variety in the different harnesses we tested - but this one almost had us in tears. The Non-Restrictive Dog Harness made by Hamilton Products of Ocala, Florida, is made of good quality materials, but extremely difficult to adjust. We wanted to throw it away! Even the manufacturer's fitting instructions were incomprehensible to us. This might be a good harness once you get it adjusted, as long as you never have to change it again! The harness has four adjustment points, but the hardware is exceptionally difficult to work. We found the Step-In Harness, made by Leatherite Nylorite, of Carmel, Indiana, to be a poorly designed harness that fit our test dogs awkwardly no matter how we adjusted the straps. We also found the plastic adjustment buckles to be of a poorer quality than those on our higher-rated harnesses. The harness has three adjustment points. The leash attachment on this harness is unique, with two D-rings coming together over the plastic connecting snap in the middle of the dog's back. This assures that no stress is put on the connecting hardware, which is a good thing. We like this feature, and the \"step-in\" concept of this product, but the final design still needs some work. Other products The following are more harnesses we tested; each earned only one paw on our product rating scale. Due to space limitations, we describe these only briefly, and don't include them in the details chart at the end of the article. Size Right! Adjustable Harness, made by Coastal Pet Products. (We purchased from J-B Wholesale, 800-526-0388; www.jbpet.com.) Available in five colors and four sizes. $5 - $9. This figure-8 style harness is a different design than most of the adjustable harnesses. Rather than separate body, neck, and sternum straps, this product consists of a single nylon strap that loops in a figure-8 over the dog's head and around the body, with connecting hardware that holds the loops together at the crossing on the dog's back. We're not fond of this design, primarily because it exerts direct pressure on the trachea, negating the primary benefit of a harness, but also because it offers less control. We think a dedicated canine escape artist could pull back and slip out of a figure-8 harness much more easily than a standard adjustable harness. Jeffers Pet Supply (800-533-3377; www.jefferspet.com) makes and sells the Jeffers Nylon Dog Harness, which comes in three colors and three sizes and sells for $3 - $6. This odd harness lacks a sternum strap - it has a sort of breastplate instead, and the only adjustment point is the metal buckle you undo to put it on and take it off. The nylon material is sturdy but stiff, and the single adjustment buckle appears to be made of an inferior-grade metal. Plus, in any position, the buckle lies directly under the dog's armpit or chest, potentially causing discomfort when the dog moves or lies down. Finally, we ordered all the harnesses in a size that should be expected to fit an average Labrador in good condition. Every harness we ordered except this one easily fit on Paws, one of our regular photo models. We had to turn to our next-smallest model, Jessie, to show this harness. We'd suggest you order a size larger than you need. The Jubilee Adjustable Harness, made by Quality Pet Products (we purchased from Direct Pet Supply, 800-360-4838; www.valleyvet.com) comes in nine colors and three sizes. $5.50 - $8. It has three adjustment points, and the hardware works easily. However, the D-ring that you would snap a leash or seat belt onto \"floats\" - it's not stitched in place, but can twist and slide along the dog's back. Also, one buckle is positioned under the dog, causing possible discomfort when he lies down, and the adjustment hardware may rest under the dog's armpits. Slippery elm (Ulmus fulva) is one of the safest herbs commonly given to dogs, and one of the most beneficial. Herbalists attribute many wonderful healing properties to slippery elm: demulcent (soothing, mucilage-forming), emollient (soothing and protective for skin), nutritive (providing specific nutrients), tonic (promoting healthy function of one or more body systems), and astringent (constricting, binding, or drying effect). It can be used both internally and externally. Slippery elm is one of the herbs used in the original formulation of \"Essiac,\" an herbal brew that has been widely promoted as a cancer-fighter. The part of the tree used is the inner bark, which is soft and stringy. Simplest to use is the powdered form, which can be purchased loose or pre-packed in capsules at most health food stores. It is also readily available over the Internet from herb suppliers. In the gastrointestinal tract, slippery elm acts directly. Think of it as a natural Pepto-Bismol (Pepto-Bismol itself should be used with caution because it contains salicylate, a.k.a. aspirin). Slippery elm's mucilage content coats, soothes, and lubricates the mucus membranes lining the digestive tract. Slippery elm is an excellent treatment for ulcers, gastritis, colitis, and other inflammatory bowel problems. It is high in fiber, and so helps normalize intestinal action; it can be used to relieve both diarrhea and constipation. It may also help alleviate nausea and vomiting in dogs suffering from non-GI illnesses, such as kidney disease. A syrup made from slippery elm bark (see recipe below) can be used to help heal mouth ulcers. Slippery elm is said to relieve inflammation of virtually any mucus membrane, and has been used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions of the lungs (bronchitis, asthma), kidneys, bladder (cystitis), throat (tonsillitis), and joints (arthritis). This wonder herb also contains many nutrients (carbohydrates, protein, fat, ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, calcium, and several trace minerals) that can be beneficial for dogs recuperating from any illness, and it may stay down when other foods are not tolerated. Externally, a soothing paste of slippery elm powder (mix the powder with a little cold water) can be used as a poultice for hot spots, insect burns, rashes, scratches, ulcerated areas, or other shallow wounds. Native Americans used slippery elm bark to stop bleeding. It forms a natural bandage that can be left in place for several hours, if you can convince your dog to leave it alone! Moisten with water to remove it. Internal Uses of Slippery Elm Slippery elm is thought to soothe the bladder lining, making it helpful for dogs suffering from cystitis. Slippery elm bark contains natural pentosans, a class of complex sugars that contains the same compound found in the drug Elmiron, the major pain-relieving treatment for interstitial cystitis in women. However, slippery elm is somewhat high in magnesium and ash, so may be contraindicated in dogs who have an active infection with an elevated urinary pH, where struvite crystal formation may be a risk. To administer internally, mix about a quarter-teaspoon of slippery elm bark powder with cold water for every 10 pounds of the dog's body weight. (The quarter-teaspoon dose works fine for dogs who are less than 10 pounds, too.) The bulk powder may be very fluffy, so pack it down as much as possible to measure it. Alternatively, use a half-capsule (per 10 pounds), opened and the contents mixed with water. Slippery elm powder will absorb many times its own weight in water, so be sure to add enough to make a moderately thick gruel. This gruel can be given before meals by syringe or eyedropper, or added to baby food, canned food, or a homemade diet. It has a slightly sweet taste and is usually well-tolerated by dogs when mixed with food. Administer the dose before or with meals for digestive tract problems, such as inflammatory bowel disease, until symptoms resolve. Because slippery elm may interfere with the absorption of certain minerals and pharmaceuticals, I would recommend that it be given several hours before or after any concurrent drug therapy. Slippery elm bark is inexpensive and easy to use; it would be a great addition to your holistic medicine chest! Recipe for Slippery Elm Syrup Author Anitra Frazier gives the following recipe for slippery elm bark syrup in her book, The New Natural Cat, which applies equally well to our canine companions when adjusted for weight: Into a small saucepan, place a half-cup of cold water and one teaspoon powdered slippery elm bark. Whip with a fork. Bring to simmer over low flame, stirring constantly. Simmer one or two minutes or until slightly thickened. Cool, cover, and refrigerate. Keeps seven or eight days. Give a teaspoon of syrup (5 cc) per 10 pounds of body weight five minutes before a meal to minimize diarrhea, or to soothe and heal mouth ulcers. Jean Hofve, DVM, is a regular contributor to WDJ. Her veterinary practice is in Englewood, Colorado. Never, in the five-year history of WDJ, have we published an article that got our readers' attention - and divided them into two disparate camps - as Kathleen Dudley's examination of spot-on pesticides (\"Are Spot-On Flea Killers Safe?\" February 2002). And that's interesting, because we've always discouraged our readers from using pesticides on and around their dogs, as part of the effort to reduce the toxic burden that most dogs labor under in their short lives. Fortunately (for us!), about 90 percent of the calls, letters, and e-mail messages we received were appreciative of the article and its follow-up piece, \"Eliminate Fleas Without Poisons,\" published in the March issue. Some readers wrote to express how pleased they were to see an article that was critical of these products in print: \"Thanks for such an educational, honest article. The main reason I subscribe to WDJ is that it is difficult to get honest, unbiased reporting in other publications. I look to you to continue to report honestly on all sides of current canine health issues - how else are we going to learn about them?\" \"I want to thank you for your informative article on flea treatments. The article was clear, concise, and gave me information I can't seem to get from my veterinarian.\" Others wrote in to confirm that they have found non-toxic flea control methods to be effective and worthwhile: \"Our two-dog, three-cat household has been flea-free for nearly 10 years without pesticides. I'm convinced that the best defense against fleas is to have the healthiest animals possible.\" By far the most rewarding letters for me to read were the letters from dog guardians who corroborated Dudley's assertions - including people who have witnessed the acute or chronic effects of these pesticides on their own dogs: \"What an eye-opening article! I almost jumped off the couch when I read the segment where the San Diego veterinarian's clients stated they put Advantage on the backs of their dogs and could smell it on the dogs' breath in a matter of minutes following the application! That is exactly what I told my vet, who told me that it wasn't possible! I will no longer use these products.\" \"I just received some information on Bayer's product, Advantage, also obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. Within one year of its introduction into the U.S., Bayer had received well over 600 incident reports, possibly close to 700 (Bayer's reports to the US EPA were in poor condition and poorly documented, thus the EPA reviewers could only estimate the exact totals). These reports included at least 70 deaths (17 dogs, 46 cats, 7 unspecified), 300 reports of skin irritation, 73 reports of central nervous system disturbances, including convulsions, 90 reports of lethargy, malaise, etc., and 92 reports of vomiting, diarrhea, or other gastrointestinal reactions. (Some animals had more than one reaction, but each animal was listed only one time in the above statistics.) . . . There are no short cuts without a price attached.\" The other camp But as I intimated earlier, not all of our readers had a positive take on our articles. A few readers were outraged that we saw fit to describe the potential dangers of using spot-on pesticides, given that \"so few dogs have actually died\" following use of these products. Each of these people expressed their unwavering support of the companies and veterinarians who make and sell these products. One went so far as to suggest that he would not only continue to use the products, but would make it his mission to propagate negative information about the article whenever he could! Another wrote: \"Apparently you have twisted sound, scientific evidence and testing to make your article more interesting. Shame on you for not investigating your author's so-called 'facts.' I happen to have a copy of the Material Safety Data Sheet from one of the products she accuses of being a health risk to humans and animals. You claim that Imidacloprid (the active ingredient in Advantage Flea Adulticide) causes thyroid lesions in dogs and that carcinogenicity is \"yet to be determined,\" when in fact, based upon the MSDS animal toxicity data, Imidacloprid is labeled as having no evidence of carcinogenicity and there is nothing written about thyroid lesions in dogs . . . \"I am a very concerned pet owner who takes impeccable care of her animals. Articles such as this are very hard to stomach and hopefully you will do the right thing and recant your false information. Granted, some products can be very dangerous to animals, but to include products such as Advantage and Frontline in the same category is just plain wrong. I have provided several of my friends with the article and hopefully you will be hearing from them, too; we are satisfied users of Advantage and trust our veterinarians' advice.\" To which I can respond only that I did, in fact, personally witness the mounds of documentation that our author compiled in support of her article. It's true that there are not easily accessible reports on the potential health effects of these products - but they do exist. I also have seen how difficult it is to obtain information about pesticides in general and spot-on products in particular. Our author had to submit Freedom of Information Act requests to obtain access to the full results of the pesticide makers' tests. It took some companies more than six months to respond to these requests (which they are legally required to respond to); some companies have not yet responded, nine months later. The makers of these products are not unique. Like most pesticide manufacturers, they are in a race against time, and they have a vested interest in stalling. There is a certain window of opportunity for all pesticide makers, in which their products can be aggressively marketed. The window opens when they have passed the EPA's initial safety tests. The products are put into use in the consuming public - and then adverse effects reports begin to come in. As the number of these reports rises, the target of the pesticides begins to adapt and develop resistance to the poisons. It may take years or even decades, but eventually, the window closes, when the products are no longer effective due to target-resistance and/or when the number of product injuries is so high that the EPA must finally file \"stop action\" orders against the chemical makers. This is history, not speculation. In the past couple of decades alone, dozens of pesticides have been ordered out of existence for these reasons. This includes several flea-killing pesticides, including (most recently) chlorpyrifos (Dursban). All of us take risks every day, and it's up to us to weigh the risks and benefits of all of our actions for ourselves. In our articles, we are not judging you or the decisions you make for your dogs. We simply want to faciliate your ability to make informed decisions. You may well decide that the risk of injury to your dogs and your family is so small, it's not worth worrying about. Others may decide it's an unneccesary risk. Finally, here's another aspect to consider: \"My reason for writing is to point out one more urgent reason not to use these toxic products. You didn't explicitly confront the issue, but it was horrifyingly evident in the data presented: the products are tested on laboratory animals, including DOGS! The description of laboratory studies brought me to tears. What an obscene concept to torture and kill laboratory dogs in toxicological studies so that the manufacturers can assure us the products are 'safe' to use on our companion dogs. I hope other readers will take note and stop using them.\" What about ticks? Some readers were disappointed that we did not discuss ticks and tick control methods in these articles. I'm sorry that I failed to direct readers to our last article on the subject, \"Ticked Off,\" August 2001 issue. However, while fleas and ticks may be (to some extent) successfully treated with some of the same pesticides, the two types of insects pose very different dangers and control challenges to dog guardians. The habitat, feeding patterns, and life cycle of the tick is very different from that of the flea, and they are not nearly as easy to target with an integrated pest management (IPM) system as are fleas. In the August 2001 article, we do discuss the issue of balancing the dangers of tick-borne diseases against the dangers of pesticides, as well as mention some IPM methods for tick control. Losing our nerve? As I mentioned earlier, flea control seems to be an incredibly polarizing issue for most dog guardians, and the letters we received were, with one exception, either strongly supportive or strongly critical of our articles on pesticide use for fleas. The one exception was when we both scored and bombed. This reader was initially thrilled that we \"took on\" the pesticide issue, but was also saddened that we offered suggestions for those who were not yet ready to give up their use of spot-on pesticides. In response to our suggestions for a \"reductionistic\" approach, she wrote: \"I just wrote you a letter praising you for your courage to publish the truth about topical flea killers. Then I accessed the latest issue online and couldn't believe my eyes after reading, 'Addicted to Spot-Ons?' \"How can you publish an article one month confirming that these products are comprised of known carcinogens, then the next month say 'Well, if you have to use these products . . .\"? This article seems like a concession to somebody, but I don't know who. Are you worried about alienating the users of these products and thus losing their subscriptions? Shouldn't you be more worried about alienating the subscribers who either don't use these products and are grateful for the validation and/or the ones who were using them and will reconsider based on this new information? This undermines the truth of the valuable message delivered in the February article. Please don't abandon your stand once you've taken it.\" I'm sorry this is how the \"at least, reduce your use\" article appeared. Actually, it was an effort to offer some practical compromises - ones that would benefit dogs - to people who are adamant that they cannot control fleas without pesticides. We do strongly believe that dogs, humans, and the environment would be far better off with reduced, and better yet, zero toxic pesticide use. As always, thanks for your close attention and support "}
