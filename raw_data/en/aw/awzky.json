On our journey through life, there are many reasons we require Ritual, Ceremony and Gatherings. It is a time when our family, friends and community gather to stand with us. To honour, connect and heal with intention. Within our community we can facilitate the significant moments in life. - Natural Living and Healing holds Gatherings and Community days for growth, connection and healing. [For an upcoming Gathering click here.](/events-2) Community Days are announced organically within community. If you engage in Natural Living and Healing you become apart of the community. [If you are looking for this then give us a call.](/contact) - - Divine Union is the coming together of two people. Our Divine Union honours the two rivers that are coming together to form one river. We bless and honour the connection, love and support each others truth and path. This ceremony can be done with just you and your partner or with your family and friends. - Honouring The death of a loved one rocks the very core of our being. Funerals can happen so fast and we are still in shock. This Ceremony is done for the family, especially and surrounding the person who is in grief. This can be done whenever we are ready, no matter how long it has been. Grieving and Forgiveness When a person passes grief is normal, we love, they touched our lives and our heart. We miss them! Grief can be unbalanced when it prevents us from moving forward. We are stuck! When this is felt it can be an indicator that it is time to heal. We must heal the trauma stored from the experience of the dying process, the death itself and our feelings of regret, doubt and come into forgiveness. This Ceremony helps us be with how we feel then surrender. It can be done individually although best when the community is present. They are the light in the darkness. Soul Retrieval A while after someone dies, the living who are emotionally or soulfully connected can experience a 'restlessness' or 'worry' that their loved one is not ok. This can be a confusing time for the deceased and living. Often if the soul is stuck in the crossover (bardo), it will reach out to the living for help. We can check on your loved one through Spirit Walking and if needed assist them to crossover. Spirit Canoe When a loved one dies we experience a 'darkness' or 'void' which overwhelms us and often we withdraw apart of ourselves from our community. This can be likened to being at the bottom of the river where it is dark within the waters of sorrow. It is our community who comes to bring the person from beneath the river into the living world, the world of all living things. - As custodian of the land you reside on, you can feel the connection to the life around you. Wanampi and the Rainbow Wave of 2020 saw an emergence of the need to connect to the land. With a vision, a feeling and need to be. Is your land ok? Our lands are called 'Sorry Lands'. Many people have lived on our lands and died. Much blood has been shed and many souls are stuck. Trees can be twisted, plants may not grow or it is like the land is 'dead'. You may feel a heavy energy or see ghosts. These are all indicators your land needs help. Natural Living and Healing can assist you with our this land bringing life back. We have a network all over Australia. - In engaging in Natural Living and Healing you become apart of the community. "}
