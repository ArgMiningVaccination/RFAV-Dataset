Fully [ 14 of the 16 medical professionals who have commented on the practice](#Scientific_consensus) say that vagina steaming is ineffective, or possibly harmful. In short, it is patent [bullshit](/wiki/Bullshit). However, vagina steaming may genuinely [upset that little man in the boat](#Causes_arousal). History[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vagina_steaming&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] It has sometimes been reported than an unspecified 8th century CE Sanskrit document described sitting over a pot of boiling onions as an [abortion](/wiki/Abortion) method [[4]](#cite_note-7) \u2014 but no one ever says which document, so it could be [BS](/wiki/BS). There is evidence of tradition use of vagina steaming in a few locales around the world (Tete, Mozambique; KwaZulu-Natal, [[6]](#cite_note-9):21 but this has not been how the practice has been promoted in the West. More definitively, The New York Medical Journal in 1897 reported the experimental use of steam on the uterus after an abortion, [[7]](#cite_note-10) though unsurprisingly this is known to cause severe burns to the delicate genital area. [[8]](#cite_note-11) This technique was being used in 20th century [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City). [[9]](#cite_note-12) Why is vagina steaming a thing nowadays? Blame [celebrities](/wiki/Appeal_to_celebrity) and [clickbait](/wiki/Clickbait). In the West, vagina steaming was not popular until the late 2000s. However, it had a following in the [alternative medicine](/wiki/Alternative_medicine) community, especially \"traditional\" Korean and Mesoamerican practitioners, who offered vaginal steam baths (then often called chai-yok or bajos). These spas played up vagina steaming as [an ancient and exotic practice](#Is_traditional_and.2For_exotic_medicine) and customers trickled in. Eventually, nontraditional spas began offering vagina steaming (likely because boiling water and letting customers pay to sit over it is lucrative). Niki Han Schwarz[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vagina_steaming&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] Vagina steaming hit the limelight in December 2010, when Niki Han Schwarz (owner of a traditional Korean spa) persuaded journalists to boost her fame report on her claim that vagina steaming [helped her become fertile](#Niki_Han_Schwarz_did_it.21). [[10]](#cite_note-LAT-13) [[11]](#cite_note-Time-14) [[12]](#cite_note-15) This started a (short-lived) period where journalists (usually female) got vaginally steamed and wrote about the experience. In turn, this briefly increased vagina steaming's broader popularity. After the hubbub died, vagina steaming quietly established a growing niche in spas, especially alternative-medicine spas. [[13]](#cite_note-Google-16) [[14]](#cite_note-LS-17) Tia & Tamera Mowry[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vagina_steaming&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] and Tamera Mowry got vaginally steamed [[14]](#cite_note-LS-17) [treats infertility](#Aids_fertility). [[16]](#cite_note-19) [[17]](#cite_note-20) again sparked a burst of popularity. This time, vagina steaming was more widespread, allowing more people to actually do it \u2014 and write about it. As a result, vagina steaming's broader popularity continued to exist (at low levels) until 2015. [[13]](#cite_note-Google-16) Gwyneth Paltrow[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vagina_steaming&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] \"\"The real golden ticket here is the Mugworth[sic] V-Steam: You sit on what is essentially a mini-throne, and a combination of infrared |\u2014| In January 2015, [Gwyneth Paltrow](/wiki/Gwyneth_Paltrow) (a fashion guru and alternative medicine promoter) got a vaginal steam bath and preached its virtues (see quote). [[14]](#cite_note-LS-17) [[18]](#cite_note-US-22) Gwyneth defended vagina steaming against the torrent of Internet ridicule by arguing that vagina steaming \" [is a thousands-of-years-old practice in Korean spas](/wiki/Appeal_to_ancient_wisdom)\". [[22]](#cite_note-26) Eight months later, Paltrow changed her story and claimed that the piece on vagina steaming \"actually came from her editorial director, Elise Loehnen\". [[23]](#cite_note-27) Right. On the greatest scale yet, another phase of journalists got steamed and wrote about it. Vagina steaming underwent a large, apparently permanent jump in popularity, [[14]](#cite_note-LS-17) maintaining almost Paltrow-era popularity 15 months later. [[13]](#cite_note-Google-16) What is it?[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vagina_steaming&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] Vagina steaming is cheap and simple, which probably explains why spas delight in charging their customers for the procedure. It goes is filled with: - Water (necessary) - Any desired plants (optional) - The pot is heated until the water starts steaming. - The pot is placed under/into a seat that allows steam to rise into the vagina, such as a toilet. - A person with a vagina then: - Removes any clothing covering the vagina (necessary) - Covers themselves with a blanket to prevent the steam from escaping (optional) - Widens their legs to increase steam intake (optional) - The \"patient\" then squats on the chair for 20 minutes to 1 hour. Vagina steaming supporters warn against steaming while [pregnant](/wiki/Pregnant), immediately after delivery, or if the vagina has an infection. [[34]](#cite_note-Monkey-38) [[26]](#cite_note-NN-30) [[35]](#cite_note-39) [[36]](#cite_note-Fab-40) Supporters also advise that a medical professional be consulted before the steaming. [[26]](#cite_note-NN-30) [[37]](#cite_note-Sklar-41) This is likely a case of the salon planning to [blame the victim](/wiki/Blame_the_victim) should anything go wrong, rather than an expectation that the client will actually see a medical professional.

Most of the plants have no proven positive health effects, and possible negative ones. [Cleanses](/wiki/Cleanse): A little yes, mostly no. [Cleans the vagina](#Cleans_the_vagina): No. The vagina self-cleans. Douching doesn't work and is harmful. [Cleans the uterus](#Cleans_the_uterus): No. Almost no steam will enter the uterus. [Reduces odor](#Reduces_odor): Yes. Odor can be drowned out with the smell of something else. However, odor is not harmful, is normal, and can help diagnosis. [Removes toxins](#Removes_.22toxins.22): No. The alleged removal of vaguely-defined \" [toxins](/wiki/Toxins)\" is an unscientific claim by definition. - [Helps irregular periods](#Helps_irregular_periods): Probably not. Vagina steaming will not solve any of the hormonal imbalances/pituitary tumors that cause irregular [periods](/wiki/Menstruation). [Treats abnormal growths](#Treats_abnormal_growths): No. no](#Causes_infections). [Balances hormones](#Balances_hormones): No. The vagina does not regulate hormones \u2014 and even if they did, steam would not \"balance\" them. [Aids fertility](#Aids_fertility): No. [Niki Han Schwarz did it!](#Niki_Han_Schwarz_did_it.21): No. This anecdotal, untested, and self-interested information isn't acceptable. [Increases circulation](#Increases_circulation): Maybe, but there are currently no credible studies that support this idea \u2014 and it is unlikely to be true since anyone with half a brain already knows that burning the vagina is bad, and many better alternatives exist. [Great for testicles too!](#Aids_fertility): Now cis men and trans women can also enjoy the benefits of getting steamed!Nope. Warmer balls are less fertile. - [Aids relaxation](#Aids_relaxation): Sure. Sitting somewhere warm and not doing anything for an hour is probably pretty nice. [Causes arousal](#Causes_arousal): Yes. This probably explains everything reported on the \"beneficial\" side. - - Harmful: [Causes infections](#Causes_infections): Possible, especially if done wrong. Shooting water into the vagina upsets its naturally acidic pH, hurts good bacteria, and makes infection more likely. [Causes steam burns](#Causes_steam_burns): Possible, especially if done wrong. Steam is as hot as boiling water, and therefore is far more likely to cause burns. [Causes vaginal irritation](#Causes_vaginal_irritation): Possible, especially if done incorrectly. Shooting water into any organ hurts it, and allergic reactions to the plants used aren't impossible. [Causes complications during pregnancy](#Causes_complications_during_pregnancy): Likely, especially if done wrong. Putting boiling water next to a womb which contains a developing baby is probably not a great idea. [Causes contraction of the purse](#Causes_contraction_of_the_purse): Yes, even if done right. - Claimed benefits[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vagina_steaming&action=edit\u00a7ion=10)] \"\"Vaginal Steaming: Just a Bunch of Hot Air? |\u2014| Before discussing any specific claims, it's useful to remember a couple of general ideas: First, no medical studies have been done on the efficacy of vagina steaming, which makes all evidence for these claims [anecdotal](/wiki/Anecdotal) at best. Further, almost all of reports of the effects of vagina steaming are produced by practitioners of it, which leads to an obvious [conflict of interests](/wiki/Conflict_of_interest) and may lead to false, exaggerated, and/or [selective reporting](/wiki/Selective_reporting). Second, many of the healing effects claimed to be the result of vagina steaming are within the bounds of a [regression to the mean](/wiki/Regression_to_the_mean), where the ailment was likely to go away even without vagina steaming. Whether a regression to the mean occurred is impossible to tell without comparison to a [placebo](/wiki/Placebo) in a [controlled trial](/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial), of which none have occurred. Given how dubious the benefits are and how easily it can do harm, [a formal investigation into vaginal steaming is unlikely to happen](/wiki/WOMBAT). Adds good plants to the vagina[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vagina_steaming&action=edit\u00a7ion=11)] Most vagina steaming claims are based on the transfer of good plants into the vagina via steam. When practitioners add plants to boiling water and let it steam, it is improbable that any significant amount of the plant rises with the steam, much less enters the vagina, the bloodstream, or the skin. If the plant is truly effective, why not increase the concentration and use it topically (smear it on) or insert it directly? To quote Dr. Siri Khalsa: [[53]](#cite_note-FC-57) Regarding Vaginal Steaming's proposed health benefits, the vagina has extensive blood flow and mucous membranes, so it absorbs medications easily, but there is no scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of absorbing herbs vaginally. The most commonly used herbs are mugwort, oregano, rosemary, basil, calendula, and marshmallow root. [[64]](#cite_note-69) Unsurprisingly, most of the plants used don't do what is commonly claimed (see the main articles for more): [Basil](/wiki/Basil)(Ocimum basilicum) is claimed to be antibacterial and spiritually cleansing. [[34]](#cite_note-Monkey-38)In vitro (test tube) studies have shown basil's antibacterial properties; however, no clinical studies have been conducted, so we don't know how well it works for humans or whether 'vagina steaming' is an effective method for applying it. No reputable journals have published on basil's spiritually cleansing properties yet, so we'll just have to wait for confirmation on that one. [Chamomile](/wiki/Chamomile)(Asteraceae spp.) is claimed to be soothing, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, and antiparasitic. [[34]](#cite_note-Monkey-38)In vitro (test tube) studies have shown that chamomile is antibacterial and antiviral; however, in vitro studies cannot necessarily be applied to humans. None of the other claims appear to have scientific merit. [Horsetail](/wiki/Horsetail)(Equisetum spp.) is claimed to flush bacteria out of the bladder. [[34]](#cite_note-Monkey-38)There's no evidence that horsetail is antibiotic. There is evidence that horsetail, especially when improperly used, contains potentially toxic chemicals! [Mugwort](/wiki/Mugwort)(Artemisia vulgaris) is claimed to and antifungal agents, [[34]](#cite_note-Monkey-38) production to maintain [[34]](#cite_note-Monkey-38) [[34]](#cite_note-Monkey-38) [[10]](#cite_note-LAT-13)prevent [[14]](#cite_note-LS-17)It hasn't been proven to do any of the above and can have mild to life-threatening allergenic reactions. - Motherwort (Leonurus cardiaca) is claimed to \"tonify\" the reproductive system (give it more \" [energy](/wiki/Subtle_energy)\"/ [qi](/wiki/Qi)/etc.), balance hormones, and increase circulation to the pelvis. [[24]](#cite_note-SM-28) [Red clover](/wiki/Red_clover)(Trifolium pratense) is claimed to promote healing of the skin. [[34]](#cite_note-Monkey-38)There is no evidence that red clover heals the skin, and there is evidence red clover causes rashes. [Rosemary](/wiki/Rosemary)(Rosmarinus officinalis) is claimed to be antiseptic and stimulate circulation. [[34]](#cite_note-Monkey-38)Little research on rosemary in humans exists, and none substantiates either of these claims. However, rosemary has been used traditionally as an abortifacent; if we accept the verdicts of traditional medicine, then vaginally steaming when pregnant with rosemary is probably an even worse idea. [Oregano](/wiki/Oregano)(Origanum vulgare) is claimed to be antiseptic and a \"uterine stimulant\". [[34]](#cite_note-Monkey-38) [[24]](#cite_note-SM-28)Oregano has certainly not been proven to be antiseptic, though it has antiparasitic potential in the intestines. Oregano also may cause miscarriages, which further advises against steaming while pregnant. We're not sure what \"uterine stimulation\" means, exactly, so it's difficult to assess it. [Sage](/wiki/Sage)(Salvia officinalis or other Salvia spp.) is claimed to \"move blood and chi through physical and emotional obstructions\". [[34]](#cite_note-Monkey-38)Sage can affect blood pressure; it usually reduces blood pressure in persons with low blood pressure and increases it in persons with high blood pressure, which is kinda not-good. We can't say anything about the chi, though. [Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood)(Artemisia spp.) is claimed to have antimicrobial/bacterial/viral properties, induce uterine contractions, and treat bladder infections, fevers, open sores, constipation, diarrhea, and parasitic infections. [[10]](#cite_note-LAT-13)Wormwood can cause vomiting and a variety of mental discomforts, and is neurotoxic in large doses. [Yarrow](/wiki/List_of_medicinal_plants#Y)(Achillea millefolium) is claimed to be astringent (contract bodily tissues), cause \"cleansing\", and be antibacterial. [[24]](#cite_note-SM-28) - Rose petals are claimed to be really soft. [[34]](#cite_note-Monkey-38) [[36]](#cite_note-Fab-40) [[24]](#cite_note-SM-28)How this helps vagina steaming, we're not sure. Of course, given its promoters' rather ... well-lubricated grasp of scientific concepts, we must consider the possibility that when they say \"plants\" they include fungi and microorganisms in that category, and are implying that vaginal steaming will somehow adjust the vaginal microflora. It's very unlikely to, and even if it did, randomly mucking about with one's own vaginal flora is unlikely to be of benefit. The vagina naturally maintains its microflora in a near-optimal equilibrium, and actively disturbing that equilibrium is seldom productive and quite possibly unhealthy. Cleans the vagina[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vagina_steaming&action=edit\u00a7ion=12)] Almost all supporters of vagina steaming mention (directly or indirectly) that vagina steaming \"cleans up\" down there. [[10]](#cite_note-LAT-13) Because who doesn't want to be \"clean\"? Depending on how someone sits, vagina steaming can either force steam onto the skin of the pelvic region or into the vagina. If vagina steaming gets water into the vagina, then it is effectively a less-intense form of douching \u2014 since in both instances, water is forced into the vagina. [[65]](#cite_note-WebMD-70) [[66]](#cite_note-WH-71) Many believe that douching effectively cleans the vagina, even though little scientific evidence supports this belief; [[65]](#cite_note-WebMD-70) [[66]](#cite_note-WH-71) similarly, it's entirely possible that many incorrectly believe that vagina steaming has the same benefits. In fact, the acidic environment of the vagina effectively self-cleans, making douching and vagina steaming unnecessary. [[14]](#cite_note-LS-17) [[65]](#cite_note-WebMD-70) [[66]](#cite_note-WH-71) These and other conditions make vagina steaming drastically [increase the risk of vaginal infection](#Causes_infection). If, on the other hand, vaginal steam is ineffective in getting steam into the vagina, then there is no benefit (other than a wet ass and some wasted time, of course). Cleans the uterus[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vagina_steaming&action=edit\u00a7ion=13)] \"\"The formulation of a vaginal steam bath consists of aromatic, cleansing herbs that will penetrate into the uterine wall. The therapeutic effects of thermotherapy and aromatherapy contribute to the effectiveness of this treatment. Overall the bath aids as a uterine lavage or internal cleanse of the membranes that often accumulate incompletely flushed debris/fluids from cycle to cycle. |\u2014Marc Sklar| Any claims of cleaning the uterus are even more specious than normal for vagina steaming. Steam has very little access to the vagina, let alone the uterus. [[20]](#cite_note-RB-24) To quote Dr. Ghodsi: [[19]](#cite_note-Pari-23) Anything put into your vagina does not have direct access into your uterus. Your cervix, which is the bottom of the uterus, sits in the top of your vagina and it does have a a tiny hole in which menstrual blood comes out, sperm goes in, and that also dilates during labor to allow a baby to come out. But it is too small for something released into your vagina to get up into your uterus unless there is an apparatus going into your uterus helping its entry or it has natural propellers like sperm. And to quote Dr. Gunter: [[45]](#cite_note-Gunter-49) Steam isn't going to get into your uterus from your vagina unless you are using an attachment with some kind of pressure and MOST DEFINITELY NEVER EVER DO THAT. Alternatively, supporters claim that herbs enter the bloodstream and flow to the uterus: [[67]](#cite_note-Eleph-72) When the herbs are placed in the hot water, their medicinal properties, including volatile oils, are released and carried to the surface of your skin, and to the inside of the vagina, where they are absorbed into the bloodstream and into to the uterus. Since blood flows from the heart to the vagina to the heart, not the uterus, we're not quite sure what mechanism is in play here. Reduces odor[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vagina_steaming&action=edit\u00a7ion=14)] Many supporters of vagina steaming argue that vagina steaming reduces vaginal odor. [[68]](#cite_note-73) [[69]](#cite_note-74) [[32]](#cite_note-Natural-36) Douching can mask vaginal odor, but doesn't truly remove it. [[66]](#cite_note-WH-71) Similarly, vagina steaming (which often contains good-smelling herbs [[70]](#cite_note-75)) probably can hide the odor of the vagina, without removing its source. A low level of vaginal odor is natural, and there's no (medically necessary) need to mask it. Strong odor may be the result of infection; if so, it is best to see a doctor before douching or vaginally steaming, because hiding the odor makes it harder for the doctor to diagnose the issue.

Aids fertility[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vagina_steaming&action=edit\u00a7ion=21)] \"\"There is absolutely no way this has any significant health benefit. The illusion that any hot air infused with some herbal spice would penetrate the vaginal barriers of your body and improve fertility, regulate hormones does not hold any water[pun intended] with me. |\u2014Dr. Manny Alvarez| Some supporters Steam baths bring heat to the womb. ... Different herbs have different healing actions. Typically more than one herb was chosen and formulated in a blend, specific to the woman's unique fertility needs. The combination of herbs work to nourish, tone, heal, bring in fresh oxygenated blood, promote cleansing, and make supple the vaginal and uterine tissues. They're wrong. The first argument in favor of increased fertility is that \"Niki Han Schwarz did it!\" Niki Han Schwarz, who was the 45-year-old owner of a vagina steaming spa, had unsuccessfully tried to become pregnant \"for three years\" \u2014 until she vaginally steamed. (Or, so she says.) [[10]](#cite_note-LAT-13) [[15]](#cite_note-Med-18) [[77]](#cite_note-87) This evidence is flawed in numerous ways: - This evidence is about as [anecdotal](/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence)as it gets, and can be explained entirely by Schwarz's [regression to the mean](/wiki/Regression_to_the_mean). - This evidence has a clear conflict of interest, since Schwarz stands to gain if vagina steaming becomes popular. While her [biased opinion](/wiki/Appeal_to_bias)is not necessarily wrong, it is more likely wrong. [[78]](#cite_note-TBTAM-88) - This evidence omits major details. For example, Schwarz doesn't explain how she was trying to get pregnant. If she was doing, for example, other fertility treatments, this could falsely make it appear as if vagina steaming had caused the fertility. [[78]](#cite_note-TBTAM-88) - Finally, this evidence still doesn't provide any mechanism through which vagina steaming is supposed to help those sperm on their way. The second argument is that vagina steaming \"increases circulation\". The idea goes that vagina steaming increases heat (obviously), that heat increases circulation (again true [[14]](#cite_note-LS-17)), and that circulation increases fertility. [[26]](#cite_note-NN-30) [[76]](#cite_note-Nat-86) (Increased bloodflow also increases the flow of oxygen and immune factors, which might be beneficial \u2014 however, they will not aid pregnancy. [[10]](#cite_note-LAT-13)) Indeed, increasing circulation in the kidneys has been shown to help pregnancy; [[79]](#cite_note-89) [[80]](#cite_note-90) so the idea is not totally insane. However: - No known scientific studies directly support the idea that warmer vaginas increase fertility. - Simply put, the effects of vagina steaming are extremely temporary. Unless someone is steaming for days on end, their bloodflow will go right back to normal extremely quickly. [Scalding the vagina](#Causes_steam_burns)is probably bad for pregnancy. - If increasing heat is the only goal, then a hot bath should aid fertility just as much as vagina steaming, at a lower cost and with fewer risks. [[11]](#cite_note-Time-14) - If increasing bloodflow is the only goal, then almost anything (including exercise and better posture) should aid fertility just as much as (if not more than!) vagina steaming, at a lower cost and with fewer risks. Finally, the third argument is that testicular steaming (which is administered in the same way and in the same place as vagina steaming) can also improve fertility. [[10]](#cite_note-LAT-13) In reality, warming the testicles inhibits sperm production and reduces fertility. [[2]](#cite_note-Sci-2) The whole reason why they dangle from the body is to keep them cooler than the body's main temperature. If warm temperatures facilitated sperm production, men wouldn't have easily-kickable nutsacks.

The practice brings a reconnection to the female body and to the wisdom of plant medicine. It is an opportunity for women to celebrate and cherish our bodies, and learning to enjoy our wombs as the beautiful, sacred center from which our capacity to change the world radiates. Yoni steaming is also about women taking back ownership of our own health, and utilizing our intuition as well as gifts from the Earth to support and nourish our well-being. Yoni steaming is also about trusting the wisdom of generations of women, elevating their perspectives as not only valid, but integral to our health. Vagina steaming does have a history in Africa and South Korea: - Some argue that vagina steaming is an \"old, respected treatment for women\" and that this somehow makes it more likely to work.

Other claims of a \"vagina steaming tradition\" are tenuous at best. [[82]](#cite_note-92) Hilda Hutchinson states: [[49]](#cite_note-Health-53) [Vaginal steaming] probably feels good because the heat increases blood flow to the whole vaginal area, including the clitoris, which could turn some women on.

[[78]](#cite_note-TBTAM-88) Douching may upset the pH balance of the vagina, which upsets the balance of good and bad bacteria in the vagina, which, in turn, increases the risks of infection.

[[65]](#cite_note-WebMD-70) [[66]](#cite_note-WH-71) [[78]](#cite_note-TBTAM-88) This is especially dangerous for vagina steaming, which may occur in public spas with less-than-sterile seating arrangements. [[78]](#cite_note-TBTAM-88) This is also especially true for yeast, which loves the warm, moist environment that steam provides. [[78]](#cite_note-TBTAM-88) As Dr. Gunter puts it: [[45]](#cite_note-Gunter-49) We don't know the effect of steam on the lower reproductive tract, but the lactobacilli strains that keep vaginas healthy are very finicky about their environment and raising the temperature with steam and whatever infrared nonsense [Paltrow]means is likely not beneficial and is potentially harmful. Some strains of lactobacilli are so hard to cultivate outside of this the very specific vaginal environment that growing them in a lab is next to impossible. There is also the possibility that the \"steam\" from these plants could contain volatile substances that are harmful to lactobacilli or other aspects of the vaginal ecosystem. Causes steam burns[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vagina_steaming&action=edit\u00a7ion=27)] Vagina steaming forces steam onto the pelvic region and potentially into the vagina. Steam definitionally, in a normal room, must be 100\u00b0 C; getting steam on you is like having boiling water spilled on you. Vagina steaming can cause steam burns. [[14]](#cite_note-LS-17) [[19]](#cite_note-Pari-23) [[20]](#cite_note-RB-24) Steam, just like boiling water, can cause burns; in fact, steam burns are far worse than burns from boiling water. [[83]](#cite_note-93) [[84]](#cite_note-94) This compounds the fact that the vagina is especially sensitive and not especially resilient. [[19]](#cite_note-Pari-23) Burning oneself is always lovely; scalding one's genitals is slightly more so. Many practitioners of vagina steaming recommend allowing the boiled water to cool first in order to attempt to avoid steam burns and lawsuits. [[25]](#cite_note-Birther-29) This helps prevent burns. It also happens to change the process from vaginal steaming to placing-one's-vagina-over-hot-water-ing. At that point, vagina steaming presumably has the same effects as using a warm compress on the region, but with more potential for infection and irritation. Causes vaginal irritation[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vagina_steaming&action=edit\u00a7ion=28)] Even if vagina steaming does not cause burns, it certainly has the potential to cause vaginal irritation. This may occur through adverse reactions to the plant(s) used (if any actually rise with the steam) or merely through the act of pushing heated water into the vagina and uterus. [[39]](#cite_note-Fox-43) While inflamed genitals may not seem so bad, if there is a precancerous condition in the vagina, then vaginal irritation may exacerbate the condition. [[39]](#cite_note-Fox-43) Chronic inflammation \u2014 by itself \u2014 is a known cause of several types of cancers. [[85]](#cite_note-95) Spreads STDs[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vagina_steaming&action=edit\u00a7ion=29)] [Sexually transmitted disease](/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease) Scientific evidence does exist on vagina steaming and STIs. Vagina steaming is used to \"dry\" the vagina by limiting vaginal secretions. After \"drying\" their people then have \"dry sex\"; supposedly, a drier vagina increases the sexual pleasure for the person with a penis. However, dry sex can be excruciating and lead to tears on the vagina, which makes it easier to transfer STIs such as [HIV/AIDS](/wiki/HIV/AIDS). [[86]](#cite_note-WHO-96) et. al. In many African cultures, plants and other intravaginal desiccants are used to minimise vaginal secretions. This practice, known as 'dry sex', creates a vagina that is dry, tight, and heated, which is supposed to generate an increased sensation for the man during intercourse. Although this is uncomfortable and painful, African women express the need to please their husbands with dry sex in order to keep them from leaving and to minimise the number of girlfriends (Baleta, 1998; Kun, 1998). Previous research has shown that dry sex damages the epithelium of the vagina and can lead to lacerations, inflammations, and the suppression of the vagina's natural bacteria, all of which increase the likelihood of infection with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV (Brown et al., 1993; Runganga and Kasule, 1995; Kun, 1998; McClelland et al., 2006). [...] None of our respondents were aware that a dry, tight vagina is a risk factor for STDs. On the contrary, they were convinced that a regular cleansing of their intimate parts would protect them against such infections and ensured their partner's fidelity. The Maroon males we spoke to were all positive about genital baths. Their only concern was that some women used not only tightening herbs in the baths but also 'dangerous' plants in order to acquire [magic]power over them. [...] Most Surinamese medical practitioners we interviewed knew of the dry-sex practices and were concerned about the possible relationship between these genital baths and the spread of STDs, HIV/AIDS, cervical carcinoma, and ectopic pregnancy in their country. [...] Maroons of both sexes, who were interviewed by Terborg (2001), explained that vaginal dryness and tightness during intercourse was not only preferred, but without it sexual pleasure was not possible. When asked if dry sex caused contact bleeding and pain, the majority of respondents answered positively. As of 2001, Suriname was experiencing a serious AIDS epidemic, with HIV being prevalent in more than 1% of the adult population (UNAIDS/WHO, 2005). The vast majority of the HIV-positives are found among the Maroons (Terborg, 2001; Terborg et al., 2005). [....] As both men and women highly appreciate dry sex, education and awareness programmes should discuss the risks of genital steam baths and encourage safe methods, such as avoiding contact bleeding during intercourse by means of a 'good warming up' and promoting the use of condoms (Terborg, 2001). In addition, any intravaginal practices have a risk of transferring STIs. [[86]](#cite_note-WHO-96) Causes complications during pregnancy[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Vagina_steaming&action=edit\u00a7ion=30)] Douching in general cause complications during pregnancy, [[14]](#cite_note-LS-17) [[66]](#cite_note-WH-71) [[65]](#cite_note-WebMD-70) and [vagina steaming is comparable to douching](#Cleans_the_vagina). (Or, at least, if vagina steaming proponents want to argue that it's effective, then they must argue that it's similar to douching \u2014 or else it does almost nothing, and isn't worth the time.)

Of those who have ever practiced, 7.3% reported genital irritation and/or pain, 1.5% reported genital itching, 0.2% reported genital bleeding or sores, and 0.9% reported [Dyspareunia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspareunia) (painful intercourse).

This would seem to support claims that vagina steaming, when accompanied with a herbal massage, can increase sexual satisfaction. For this claim, the article cites the book Medical Botany: Plants Affecting Man's Health (1977); however, this species of Satureja is not actually mentioned in the book.

[[95]](#cite_note-106) A multi-country study on gender, sexuality and vaginal practices: Implications for sexual health [[86]](#cite_note-WHO-96) The WHO noted that: - 67% of women in Chonburi, [Thailand](/wiki/Thailand)vaginally steam - 86% of women in mainland Asia reported vaginally steaming after giving birth - 10% of women in Tete vaginally steam, 64% in order to increase male sexual pleasure via vaginal tightening, and 23% in order to dry the vagina The article also noted, in general, that some recent studies suggest that those who perform intravaginal practices (such as vagina steaming) and especially those who have \"dry sex\" (for which people vaginally steam) [have higher rates of sexually transmitted infections and HIV](#Spreads_STIs). Dry sex in Suriname [[87]](#cite_note-Andel-97) This article mentions that vaginal steam baths, particularly steam baths that contain drying and tightening herbs are used to dry and contract the vagina in order to improve pleasure during sex. However, as the article notes, such a practice [can harm the vagina and spread STDs](#Spreads_STDs). The article provided insight into another reason (besides dry sex) that people vaginally steam: Being clean is essential in the Afro-Surinamese culture and is reflected in its ethnobotany. Menstruating women and mothers in childbed are considered unclean (Price, 1993; Fleury, 1996). Vaginal baths are seen as a way to purify the female body and make it attractive again for the opposite sex (Fleury, 1996). The articles also stated that vagina steaming after delivering a baby may be better than no treatment at all: These baths also caused the uterus to return to its former shape and prevented childbed fever and a sagging waist. If a woman refrained from cleansing her uterus after childbirth, she ran the risk of contracting 'cold in the belly'. According to our respondents, this dangerous illness, caused by 'dirty blood' left in the uterus after delivery, could lead to severe abdominal pains, fever, and ultimately death. This description suggests serious uterine infections and puerperal fever. [...] Given the popularity of dry sex, its important role in AfroSurinamese culture, and the limited understanding of infective mechanisms in Maroon society, a general prohibition of genital steam baths in Suriname is no option. Moreover, prohibiting traditional midwife practices could have negative effects on women's health, especially in remote areas where health centres are poorly staffed and equipped (Terborg, 2001; Ticktin and Dalle, 2005). [...] Our results show that genital steam baths are frequently used to facilitate the removal of placental remains after birth, miscarriage or abortion. In the major Maroon settlements, where 58% of the deliveries take place without an officially trained birth attendant (United Nations Population Fund, 2007), knowledge of medicinal plants that contract the uterus and prevent puerperal fever can save lives. Cleaning out the uterus after a miscarriage by means of steam and herbs is preferable to receiving no treatment at all. That said, the article isn't an empirical study and doesn't jibe with the idea that [it's hard to get steam into the uterus](#Cleanses_the_uterus).
