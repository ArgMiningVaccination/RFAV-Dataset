Of course, I'm talking about bacteria and viruses - from E. coli and golden staph, to the [common cold, influenza](https://elementsoflife.com.au/article/healing-a-cold-or-flu-with-acupuncture/), and now Covid-19. The Role of the Immune System The unsung hero in this ongoing battle is your body's own immune system. Often described as a defence mechanism, it actually performs a variety of tasks to protect you from these invisible threats, such as: - conducting \"search and destroy\" missions; - preventing to their target; - neutralising toxic activity; - attacking and killing any foreign substances. In many cases your immune system also learns from this active combat, so that it is armed and ready for any possible future skirmishes! With the outbreak of Coronavirus, there has never been a more important time to make sure your immune system is in great shape and ready for battle. How Could TCM Boost your Immune System? Evidence to support the benefits of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practices - such as [acupuncture](https://elementsoflife.com.au/acupuncture-sydney/) and the prescription of Chinese herbs - is growing all the time. TCM takes a takes a holistic approach to health and wellbeing, encompassing a range of lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, sleep, and stress - all of which have the potential to impact your immune system. Studies have demonstrated that acupuncture promotes healthy immune function, by: - reducing the production of stress hormones such as cortisol and noradrenaline; - increasing the supply of white blood cells; - supporting cell growth and repair; - releasing hormones at night to aid restful sleep; and - reducing inflammation. Chinese Herbs Even if you've never seriously considered natural or alternative therapies, you've most likely heard about echinacea and ginseng, which have been highly prized in TCM for centuries. Many Chinese herbs have been shown to possess antiviral and antibacterial qualities. Research has also confirmed that one traditional Chinese prescription (Antiwei) is beneficial in the treatment of the flu and similar illnesses, reducing both the severity and the duration of symptoms. However \"prevention is better than cure\" as the old saying goes. If you are interested in supporting your immune system in a natural way, I invite you to [make an appointment](https://elementsoflife.com.au/contact-us/) with me to explore the possibilities of Traditional Chinese Medicine for yourself.
