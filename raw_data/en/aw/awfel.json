It is part of the 4 branches of traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine (TCVM), along with Chinese herbal medicine, Chinese food therapy, and Tui-na (veterinary massage). While acupuncture has been widely studied in scientific communities in recent years, its clinical use in history dates back over 2,000 years to treat all kinds of ailments. Scientifically, acupuncture points are connected to the nervous system and when stimulated release endorphins and serotonin to help with pain and dis-ease within the body. From a traditional standpoint, according to Chinese medicine it helps the flow of \"Qi\" (life energy) where it is blocked and brings about balance and restores homeostasis. Laser Therapy We are proud to announce we are now offering laser therapy, an innovative new way to treat pain and inflammation in pets. Laser therapy uses specific wavelengths of light to create therapeutic effects such as improved healing time, pain reduction, increased circulation and decreased swelling. Multiple studies have shown laser therapy can help with a variety of problems including arthritis, joint pain, ligament sprains, muscle strains, dog/cat bites, feline acne/asthma, hotspots, post trauma/surgery pain, hip dysplasia, lick granulomas and snake/bug bites. L.A.S.E.R. is an acronym which stands for \"Light Amplification by the Stimulated Emission of Radiation\". It is also known by other names in literature and in clinical practice. A few of these include: Low Level Light (Laser) Therapy (LLLT), Phototherapy, and Photobiomodulation. So how does laser therapy work? Laser therapy uses specific wavelengths of light to create therapeutic effects. These light waves enter the cell of the animal and are absorbed by photoreceptors in the mitochondria (the power house) of the cell. These reactions begin a cascade of multiple events which can provide extra energy for the cell allowing for a more rapid healing time, increased circulation, decreased swelling, and reduced pain and inflammation What can laser therapy help treat? Multiple studies have shown laser therapy can help with a variety of problems including arthritis, joint pain, ligament sprains, muscle strains, dog/cat bites, feline acne/asthma, hotspots, post trauma/surgery pain, hip dysplasia, lick granulomas and snake/bug bites. Our laser also has the capability of producing a specific wavelength of \"blue light\". This particular spectrum of activity has been shown in multiple studies to help with fighting off bacteria which cause infections. Treatments: Laser therapy treatments must build up within the body to a steady state for them to be most effective. That is why we recommend a series of laser treatments. The typical treatment protocol is 3 times the first week, 2 times the second week, and 1 time the third week. Follow up therapy is performed as needed for the pet's condition. Remember, this is just an average, the exact frequency and treatment duration can vary on a case by case basis. Aromatherapy/Essential Oils Essential oils are aromatic liquids distilled from certain parts of plants. These can include leaves, stems, barks, roots, flowers, and in the case of citrus oils, the rind. They are most often diffused and used for their aromatic properties. Veterinary aromatherapy moves beyond using essential oils for their aromatic value alone. It uses the 100% pure, medical grade essential oils and their chemical properties to help combat diseases by helping the body maintain a strong immune system and stay above the wellness line. With proper training veterinary aromatherapy incorporates essential oils utilized aromatically (diffused into the air), applied topically, or ingested orally. There are a few medical grade essential oil companies out there. We use the Young Living brand. After doing our research we are extremely pleased with their company and their quality of oils. They not only produce the highest quality medical grade essential oils, they also are the only company to implement a \"seed to seal\" program that insures no chemical or pesticides touch the plant. They follow it from the beginning to the end. Dr. Mitchell has advanced training in the safe and effective use of essential oils in animals. He is a Certified Veterinary Medical Aromatherapist (CVMA) through the Veterinary Medical Aromatherapy Association (VMAA). There are numerous clinical and scientific studies that can be found on medically relevant sites such as PubMed which document the amazing medical uses of essential oils. Dr. Mitchell will be happy to discuss how to safely and properly use essential oils to best benefit your pet. Dental Care Dental care is vital to the overall health of any pet. Dental disease can lead to health issues with the heart, liver, and kidneys and has the potential to seep into your pet's bloodstream. In fact, 80 percent of dogs and 70 percent of cats over three years of age suffer from some form of dental disease, making it the most common pet health issue among our pet population. Surgery We are pleased to offer our clients the highest quality veterinary care. We want nothing but the best for our clients and their pets, especially during surgery. We provide a relaxed and calming surgical environment where your pet and their procedure is the primary focus. We offer continuous surgical monitoring including EKG, pulse ox, and blood pressure.

Every year, thousands and thousands of pets go missing. Not knowing where your pet is or how to bring them back can be a helpless, hopeless feeling. It's a tragedy that happens all too often. But there is a simple, safe, and effective way to ensure your pet's safety and retrieval should he or she ever become lost. Microchipping is a standard procedure that implants a tiny chip underneath your pet's fur. It is a painless and relatively fast procedure and is completely safe. Vaccinations Throughout the years advancements in science and vaccines have helped prevent many deadly diseases in pets. At Mitchell Animal Clinic in Mobile, AL , we recognize the importance of vaccinations as a part of the healthcare plan for your pet. However, we fully believe that there is no \"one size fits all\" approach to medicine, especially when it comes to vaccines. We believe in discussing the lifestyle of the pet and evaluating the risk / benefit relationship when it comes to administering certain vaccines. It is important to consult with us about the unique risks of living in our region. We will be happy to discuss the benefits of protecting your pet with vaccinations, as well as, discuss any alternative options which may be available. Please remember, our goal is to provide the proper protection and immunity for your pet without over vaccination. However, we must still adhere to federal and state guidelines on required vaccinations. 1. 3 Year Rabies Vaccinations 2. Titer Testing - Vaccinate pets based on their individual risks - Administer only the core vaccines when possible - Split vaccines when needed so not too many are being administered at one time. - Standardize where the vaccines are given if the pet will cooperate. For example: Rabies is given on right rear hip and Distemper, Parvo is given on the left hip. This allows for monitoring for any tenderness or swelling in the area and it allows us to know which vaccine was given and if we need to avoid it in the future. - We try to use smaller (\"baby\") needles to make the pet more comfortable - When possible (if available from the manufacturer) we use thimerosal free vaccines - As an alternative to annual vaccinations we offer titer testing. When a pet has had previous vaccines a level of immunity develops within the pet's body. Through a blood test, we are able to monitor the level of immunity found within the pet's body, and this helps us determine the best vaccination strategy for your pet and helps us prevent over-vaccination. Please contact us for further discussion about titer testing. Wellness Exams At Mitchell Animal Clinic in Mobile, AL , we believe that regular checkups and wellness exams are critical to your pets' well-being. These wellness exams give us a chance to evaluate the overall health of your pet while also giving us a baseline for their unique bodies and tendencies. Not only do these exams keep us up-to-date with your pets' health, but they also allow us to detect potential problems before they become serious. This thorough checkup gives us vital information to help keep your pet healthy! Heartworm and Parasite Prevention The idea of your pet being infested with parasites is a disturbing thought, but it's also a medical issue that can have serious consequences if not properly dealt with or prevented. At Mitchell Animal Clinic, we emphasize the importance of preventing parasites. Through preventative measures, you can successfully protect your pet. Heartworms: Heartworms are caused by mosquitoes, and as everyone is aware, in Mobile, Al and the surrounding areas mosquitoes are plentiful and they are a year round nuisance. This also means that they can be a year round risk for our pets. At Mitchell Animal Clinic we always try to reach for an all natural or integrative alternative. However, in the case of heartworms, we recommend your pet receive a heartworm test annually and be on year round prevention. Intestinal Parasites: There are numerous intestinal parasites which can infect our pets. Some of these include Hookworms, Roundworms, Whipworms, Tapeworms, Coccidia, and Giardia. Fecal testing and other diagnostic testing are useful for parasite screening. Results can help guide treatment options. External Parasites: As mentioned before, we live in an area and climate which has prime conditions for external parasites such as fleas and ticks to flourish. At Mitchell Animal Clinic we know that these external parasites can not only be worrisome to pet owners, but can also cause disease. We will try to find an all natural solution for ridding the parasites from your pet. Sometimes, however, a commercially available pharmaceutical product may be required. No matter which route is utilized year round prevention is recommended. Bloodwork Our onsite blood machines allow us to more accurately diagnose your pet's illnesses and assess the severity of infections as well as the functions of the internal organs such as the liver and kidneys. Our onsite bloodwork includes: 1.Complete Blood Count (CBC) 2.Biochemistry Profile (Chemistry Panel) 3.Thyroid screening (T4) OnSite Diagnostics We have state-of-the-art diagnostic tools that allow our staff to diagnose your pets' condition or illness better. It is our commitment to stay on the cutting edge of diagnostic technology. Having these advanced diagnostic tools allows us to examine specific areas more carefully and provide a quicker and more accurate diagnosis. We use many tools such as radiology, lab tests, and various other equipment and tests. Urinalysis: Urinary health is very important and our ability to quickly evaluate a urine sample allows for quick diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections. Radiology (X-Rays): X-rays are a certain type of picture taken with a special machine which helps us look inside the pet. This is useful for evaluating the inside organs of the pet as well as the Gastrointestinal tract along with the bones and skeleton. Ultrasounds: Ultrasound is a quick and painless procedure. It uses sound waves to allow us to see inside your pet. This can help evaluate internal organs as well as inappropriate accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. Fecal / Parasite Examinations Parasite screenings can be performed on site and deworming recommendations can be made. Supplements At Mitchell Animal Clinic we understand that each pet is an individual and as such each pet may require different levels of medical care, nutrition, and supplements to help maintain their optimal health. Glucosamine, Chondroitin, and Joint supplements: Just as humans, pets can develop arthritis and joint disease as they age. It is important to remember that our pets often age faster than their human counterparts. Due to this, joint issues can develop sooner than what owners may be aware. Adding a supplement to help with joint issues is a great way to help reduce inflammation, provide comfort, and slow progression of some joint issues in our pets. Ask us about InPrime and how it may help your pet. Probiotics What can probiotics help with? The simple answer is just about everything. The GI tract has a major influence on many aspects of overall health from immunity to neurological influences. That is why if the \"guts\" are not happy the body is not happy. At Mitchell Animal Clinic we have seen great results with probiotics for gastrointestinal issues and skin conditions. Ask us about Synacore and how it may help your pet. Anti-anxiety / calming supplements Many pets suffer from anxiety. Living in an area where frequent thunderstorms are common does not help. Anxiety can be very stressful for pets as well as their owners. While some pets may require medications to control severe cases of anxiety others may do very well on all natural calming supplements. Ask us about Pro Quiet and calming pheromones (such as Adaptil) and how it may help your pet. All-natural ear cleaners and skin sprays Ear and skin problems can be very worrisome for pets and their owners. Allergies and ear issues are quiet common in our area. An all natural treatment option may be helpful if the pet is having chronic issues.
