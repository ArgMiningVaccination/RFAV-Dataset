House Human Services Committee HB 1472 Tamara Krause, Committee Clerk #4979Testimony in Support of House Bill 1472 Rep. Sebastian Ertelt ND District 26 Chairman Weisz and Members ofthe House Human Services Committee, For the record, I am Representative Sebastian Ertelt representing North Dakota District 26, which includes all of Sargent County, the eastern half of Dickey County, the southern half of Ransom County, and the western half of Richland County. This is a heavily rural district with limited access to health care. The two largest cities in the district are Lisbon with a population of approximately 2,154, and Oakes with a population of approximately 1,856. Both of these cities have hospitals that provide limited services. I am before you today to present House Bill 1472 and ask a unanimous DO PASS recommendation to help improve the health of the citizens of our state by allowing, with restrictions and disclosures, increased access to complementary and alternative care. You can see that the bill is focused on increasing this access while protecting the consumer with the section on prohibited acts such as medical disease diagnosis or performing surgery, as well as the disclosure section. It leaves in place all other licenses, certifications, or registrations issued by the state and does not limit seeking relief. I have included with my testimony several charts and commentary regarding health prepared by North Dakota Compass through The Center for Social Research at North Dakota State University. These charts cover the topics of diabetes, obesity, health care coverage, and mental health. As you can see, the trend over the past 25 years is a steady increase in the rate of both diabetes and obesity in adults, more than doubling for both. The percentage of adults experiencing 14 or more mentally unhealthy days per month has only been tracked for the past 4 years, but is also showing an upward trend. This decrease in health among our residents has occurred despite an increase in percentage of residents under age 65 with health insurance over the past 12 years. If we give an honest evaluation of the data, we will recognize that the health of the citizens of North Dakota is worsening and the mainstream medical community cannot provide the care on their own that our citizens need. The marketplace itself is proving this for us. According to Johns Hopkins, complementary and alternative medicine is used by about 38% of adults and 12% of children in the United States. I believe that North Dakota should welcome those who wish to share their talents in caring for our citizens, especially if our citizens wish to pursue such care to complement their primary medical care or find alternative care that might offer relief for their suffering. The non-invasive, gentle care provided by such complementary or alternative care providers can be a win-win-win situation, for primary medical providers, our citizens, and the complementary and alternative care providers. #4985 DIABETES According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. Adults with diabetes are two to four times more likely than adults without diabetes to have heart disease or experience a stroke. During any given year, individuals with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to require hospitalization . Increases in rates of diabetes (i.e., Type 2 diabetes) among adults have been described by the CDC as a major public health threat. Obesity and physical inactivity are strongly associated with the development of diabetes. Although diabetes develops most often in overweight, middle-aged and older adults, diabetes is becoming more common in overweight and obese children. Diabetes can be prevented, or at least delayed, by exercise, good nutrition, and other healthy lifestyle choices. 25% 20% 15% 10% 5% North Dakota, 1995-2019 0 North[ C North l Users are strongly cautioned against comparing trends before 2010 to trends after 2011, due to changes in weighting methodology and the addition of the cell phone sampling frame beginning with the 2011 study.

MENTAL HEALTH The World Health Organization defines mental health not simply as the absence of a mental illness, but rather as \"a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community .\" Good mental health is as important as good physical health. Mental illness (e.g., alternations in thinking, mood, and/or behavior) can impair individuals' ability to work, to raise their families, and to participate in their communities. Serious mental illness can lead to individuals harming themselves and/or others. In addition to affecting individuals and their families, mental illness imposes significant economic costs on communities as a whole (e.g., employers, government, health care systems, and the general public).

According to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, uninsured individuals are less likely to receive preventive care or care for routine medical conditions and injuries. Lack of preventive health care and lack of treatment for medical conditions can lead to more serious illnesses and health problems . This, in turn, can result in preventable hospitalizations and deaths. Furthermore, the lack of health care coverage affects everyone in a community. Those without health insurance feel the direct physical, mental, and financial effects of not having healthcare coverage, while the insured are affected indirectly through higher health care premiums and higher taxes. 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% Residents under age 65 without health insurance North Dakota and U.S., 2008-2019 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 20H Sources: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey.

Mission Statement To promote access to all health care information, services, treatments and products that the people deem beneficial for their own health and survival; to promote legislative reform of the laws impacting the right to access; and to promote the health of the people of this nation. NATIONAL HEALTH FREEDOM ACTION PMB 218, 2136 Ford Parkway St. House Bill regarding Complementary and Alternative Care To: Chairman Representative Weisz and Members of the House Human Services Committee Representative : My name is Diane Miller . I am an attorney and the Director of Law and Public Policy for National Health Freedom Action (NHFA) and its sister educational organization National Health Freedom Coalition (NHFC). National Health Freedom Action (NHFA) is a 501(c)4 non -profit corporation working to protect maximum health care o ptions for consumers . NHFA works to protect the right of people to access the health care practitioners, health care products, and the broad range of healing arts that resonate with his or her own decisions regarding health and wellness. NHFA responds to calls year -round from individuals and groups throughout the country who wish to promote legal reform in occupational laws and regulations having to do with complementary and alternative health care on the state level. We have subscribers to our organi zation in North Dakota who would like to have protective laws for unlicensed healers and practitioners who are providing non -invasive methods of healing and health services in North Dakota similar to other states that have protective laws . NHFA supports HB1472 because it w ill protect access to hundreds of traditional, complementary , and alternative care practitioners such as traditional naturopaths, homeopaths, and herbalists, providing their services to health seekers in North Dakota and wh o are not licensed under medical health care occupation laws . HB1472 leaves in place current licensing laws and current enforcement provisions for the unlicensed practice of medicine, however it makes an addition to the current unlicensed practice exemptions, creati ng a new exemption for those who are practicing non-invasive complementary and alternative care and who (1) avoid a specific list of prohibited conduct, such as puncturing the skin and, (2) who give out the disclosure information for unlicensed practitione rs listed in the bill, such as contact information, education and training, and the nature of the services to be provided . #4267 Mission Statement To promote access to all health care information, services, treatments and products that the people deem beneficial for their own health and survival; to promote legislative reform of the laws impacting the right to access; and to promote the health of the people of this nation. The use of complementary and alternative practitioners is prevalent in the United States . Based on a February 2015 National Healt h Statistics Report , the percentage of U.S. adults aged 18 and over who used any complementary health approach was 33.2%.i And b ased on the 2012 National Institute of Health's NHIS Survey from the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), it was found that about 59 million Americans spend money out-of-pocket on complementary health approaches, and their total spending adds up to $30.2 billion a year. This means that thousa nds of North Dakota citizens are using complementary and alternative health care and spending millions of dollars in the State of North Dakota for that care. Clients find that gentle complementary and alternative care practitioners offer approaches that are often either more natural or may help them address their health concerns by lifestyle changes or non -invasive healing techniques from a broad variety of methods that the consumer has become aware of through their own research and networking. Many complementary and alternative practitioners are not licensed to practice a conventional health care profession and do not have a desire or plan to become conventionally licensed in a medical profession. Because NHFA wants to assure consumers their broadest a ccess to their healing services , we support North Dakota 's HB1472 and are glad that it is before this committee. We have observed that state safe harbor practitioner exemption laws, similar to ND's HB1472, provide a practical way for states to assure continued consumer access to and the availability of practitioners and modalities while also retain ing the avenues that state governments have to process complaints for unlicensed practice and enforce the unlicensed pr actice provisions against those who go outside the requirements of prohibited acts and disclosures in the exemption . Currently eleven states have passed \"safe harbor \" practitioner exemption law s in some form, including : Minnesota, Rhode Island, California , Louisiana, Idaho , Oklahoma, Arizona (for homeopaths) , New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, and, most recently , Maine . Additional states have introduced and are working to pass similar legislation including in this session Wisconsin , Massachusetts , Iowa, and Co nnecticut . Safe harbor laws do not change the regulation of licensed profession als. Complementary and alternative methods of treatment are also provided by many licensed professional s but they practice under the jurisdiction of their own licens ing Boards. We believe that s afe harbor practitioner exemption laws are a common -sense way of addressing how to manage the hundreds of practitioners and businesses providing services in the public domain. These laws provide practitioners and the state wit h guidance parameters on how to proceed in the event of a complaint while assur ing the continued availability of these services to consumers who enjoy them. NHFA believes that HB1472 goes a long way in protecting consumer access to the broad domain of hea ling modalities practiced by practitioners currently not licensed by the state of North Dakota . NHFA respectfully urges you to support HB1472 and we hope this letter is helpful in answering any of your questions about this type of legislation.

I'd like to begin with just a b rief introduction of our org anization and then I'll provide a brief explanation of the problem HB 1472 is designed to solve and how it solves it. I'll be happy to answer any questions you have. NHFA is a 501c4 n on-profit organization , dedicated to protecting max imum health care options for consumers so they can exercise their rights to access the health care practitioners, products, services, and information that resonate with their own individual decisions for achieving and maintaining health and wellness . We a re based in MN but work nationally to educate and empower citizens to promote legal reform in occupational laws and regulations related to health care on the state level . We ha ve the privilege of working with residents in many states to draft practitioner exemption legislation , similar to HB 1472 , and we enjoy getting to know them while supporting bills as they move through the legislative process. We work with them only after they reach out to us for a solution to a problem in their state laws. The problem in current state laws is not unique to ND law - but it's a problem that leaves complementary and alternative care practitioners vulnerable to criminal charges for practicing medicine - or another licensed health care profession - without a license . The potent ial of be ing put in jail for something as simple and innocent as exercising free speech rights when helping another person get well by, for example , teaching someone about their body 's natural healing processes (information anyone can find by using google or going to their local library ), or by recommending the consumption of foods and herbs with healing properties #42712 (many of which are available to any consumer already at Whole Foods , the local co -op, or on Amazo n). That's what we're here to change with HB 1472 . We're happy to support HB 1472 which we believe is a proactive, solution -oriented piece of legislation that gives ND the opportunity to reform its laws to reflect what is happening in the culture already. As you' ll hear from th e testimony or from your individual constituents , consumers are increasingly searching for , embracing , and benefitting from health care options that involve lifestyle and behavior modifications and/or gentle healing therapies over , or alongside of , more conventional, pharmaceutical -based options. Consumers are searching for approaches from a broad variety of methods that the consumer has become aware of through their own research and networking. We are so fortunate to live in the age of information where we can learn about anything we wan t - often without even having to leave the comfort of our homes to do so. But finding a practitioner who offers these services is challenging. Many of the practitioners who consumers are looking for are not licensed to practice a conventional health car e profession and do not have a desire or a plan or the means to become conventionally licensed. But that doesn't mean that they shouldn't be able to speak honestly about what they know or that they shouldn't be able to put to use the education, training o r credentials, or other experience that they invested time and money in pursuing. And it certainly doesn't mean they don't have a role to play in supporting the health and wellness journeys of ND residents . ND residents want access to practitioners who can help them navigate their holistic health options; herbalists, health coaches, and others. But these practitioners are often hard to find because they work under the radar b ecause of the fear of criminal charges. These criminal charges arise from the bro ad definition of the practice of medicine at ND Statute ch. 43-17-01, subd. 5 (a)-(d), which provides, in part, that a person is practicing medicine if he or she: \"[is] engaged within this state in the [...] treatment o f diseases or injuries \"; or \"suggests, recommend s, or prescribes any form of treatment for the intended relief or cure of any physical or mental ailment of any individual \". It's good to have a broad definition. We want doctors to be able to use all the tools in their tool belt to help people get well. But the problem is that anyone who does anything within that broad definition without holding a license - even if it's not danger ous or harmful - can be put in jail or fined thousands of dollars . HB 1472 does not seek to change that broad definition, but it asks ND law to acknowledge the impact that the broad definition has on complementary and alternative care providers by provi ding them with an exemption under certain situations. ND law already has a long list of exemptions at the end of each health care licensing law. Typically, these exemptions are for other licensed health care professionals doing some of the dangerous thing s that another licensed professional does under their licensing law. Also, there are exemptions that exist for non - licensed people - for example Good Samaritan laws in cases of emergencies , or for home 3 remedies (see e.g., ND Statute ch. 43-17-02, at subd. 2 ) - those won't be charged criminally for unlicensed practice. HB 1472 is asking you to add another exemption; not for dangerous things that have to be restricted to a few. Rather an exemption for gentle, common -sense, non -invasive activities , that yes, do fit within the broad definition of the practice of medicine or other regulated professions but activities that should be allowed in the public domain because they don't rise to the level of potential for harm that requires state regulation. HB 1472 provides guidelines for the use of an exemptio n from occupational licensure and registration requirements for these unlicensed complementary and alternative health care practitioners as long as they : (1) give out the Required D isclosures listed in the bill on p. 2, lines 5 -26; and (2) avoid a specific list of Prohibited Acts outlined on p. 1, lines 13 -24, and p. 2, lines 1 -3, of the bill. We have observed t hat the practitioner exemption laws - passed in 11 states so far - provide a practical way for states to assure continued consumer access to , and the availability of , complementary and alternative care practitioners and modalities wh ile also retaining the avenues that state governments have to process complaints for unlicensed practice when the need arises. With HB 1472 in place, when/if a complaint arises, the question asked by the state would change from \"Was the person practicing medicine without a license? \" to: \"Did the person fail to give out a required disclosure or did he/she perform a prohibited act? \" I want to be clear th at HB 1472 would not change the regulation of licensed professionals. Complementary and alternative methods of treatments are also provided by many licensed professionals (such as an oncologist who might advis e a patient to take turmeric or to see an herbalist ) but they practice under the jurisdiction of their own licensing boards. Exempti on laws, like we hope HB 1472 will become in the state of ND, are a common sense way of addressing how to manage the thousands of practitioners and businesses providing services in the public domain - not under a board. These laws provide practitioners and the state with guidance parameters on how to proceed in the event of a complaint while assuring the continued availability of those services to consumers who safely enjoy them. We believe HB 1472 goes a long way in protecting consumer access to the b road domain of healing modalities practice d by small business owners (often moms and wives trying to help make ends meet) who are not currently licensed by the state of ND. NHFA respectfully urges you to support HB 1472 . Thank you. Sincerely, Anne Gillum , Phone: 612 -237-6684 Good Afternoon Ihmels, RDN, CSO, LRD Oncology Dietitian in Bismarck and President of the North Dakota Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics representing 250 dietitians in the state. I am here today to testify in opposition of HB 1472. This bill allows the practice of complementary and alternative care but does not define a scope of practice or education requirements for individuals practicing \"alternative care\" in our state. This lack of clarity adds confusion regarding what alternative and complementary care is and opens the door to a large spectrum of care for these individuals to \"practice\". It also lacks a governing board to ensure that those practicing alternative care are not stepping outside the bounds of the short list of prohibited acts. I work with patients regularly who have received poor advice relating to their treatment regimens causing vitamin toxicities, severe unintentional weight loss, financial harm and in turn can reduce the likelihood of successfully completing treatment. It is the North Dakota Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics position that complementary and alternative medicine should be provided by a qualified, licensed healthcare professional. Therefore, we are recommending a DO NOT PASS of HB 1472. Thank you for your time. I am available to answer any questions you may have. Sincerely, Amanda Ihmels, RDN, CSO, LRD President of North Dakota Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics #4473$\u00b7NDMA ~Esr.1ss1 NORTH DAKOTA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION House Human Services Committee HB 1472 February 1, 2021 Chairman Weisz and Committee Members. I am Courtney Koebele, executive director of the North Dakota Medical Association. The North Dakota Medical Association is the professional membership organization for North Dakota physicians, residents, and medical students. The North Dakota Medical Association opposes HB 1472, which provides for complementary or alternative care by unlicensed providers. Our concerns focus on patient safety and quality medical care. Some complementary and alternative therapies have been reported to cause serious problems or even deaths. Delaying surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or other tradonaltreatment by using an alternative therapy can allow the cancer to grow and spread to other parts of the body. There is minimal scientific research on alternative care. Alternative medicine is largely based on natural products and how they interact with and heal your body. Alternative medicines entail a longer treatment and healing time as they attempt to heal the problem. Much of alternative medicine isn't approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Physicians are specifically trained to recognize when a symptom may mask an underlying condition. NDMA is concerned that the treatment of a clearly visible symptom may mask an underlying condition -thereby putting the patient at heightened risk if the unlicensed provider falsely believes that the patient is \"cured\" because there is a temporary decrease in symptoms. NDMA respectfully requests a DO NOT PASS on HB 1472. Thank you for your time today. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. 1 #49771 2021 HB 1472 House Human Services Chairman Febr uary 2, 2021 Chairman Weisz and members of the House Human Services Committee , I am Melissa Hauer , General Counsel of the North Dakota Hospital Association. I am here to testify regarding 2021 House Bill 147 2 and ask that you give this bill a Do Not Pass recommendation. The bill would allow an unlicensed individual to provide \"complementary or alternative care\" so long as the individual does not perform any of the prohibited acts listed, provides written notice to clients and posts notice stating that the practitioner is not licensed, certified, or registered, as a health care professional or pr actitioner. The notice would describe the nature of the complementary or alternative care to be provided, and the practitioner's degrees, training, experience, credentials, or other qualifications, if any , regarding th e care . Before the first treatment , the practitioner must obtain written acknowledgment from the client that the required information has been provided . If these require ments are met, the unlicensed individual can perform complementa ry or alternative care . The bill does not define \"complementary or alternative care\" . Practitioners could provide any type of complementary or alternative care ex cept they may not: 1.Perform surgery, set fractures, or perform any other procedure on any individual which punctures or harmfully invades the skin. T his does not include the piercing of the noncartilaginous perimeter or lobe of the ear; 2.Prescribe or administer x-ray radiation; 3.Prescribe or administer drugs, devices, or controlled substances for which a prescri ption by a licensed health care provider is NDHA - Feb. 1, 2021 2 | P a g e 4. Provide a medical disease diagnosis; 5. Recommend to a client that the client discontinue current medical treatment that is prescribed by a licensed health care professional; 6. Perform a chiropractic adjus tment of the articulations of joints or the spine; or 7. Hold out, state, indicate, or advertise, to any person that the individual is a health care professional or practitioner licensed, certified, or registered, by this state unless the individual holds suc h credential. The bill is so broadly written that it would allow an unlicensed individual to perform any treatment or care other than the listed prohibited acts , so long as the required notice is given . For example, an unlicensed individual could provide psychotherapy, nursing care, dentistry, physical therapy, occupational therapy, podiatry, psychology, radiologi c imaging such as ordering and reading MRI's, and a host of other health care services that require a professional license and specialized education and training under current law. The concern over untrained, unlicensed providers giving care is increased when you consider that \"alternative care\" is generally view ed as care that is used instead of standard medical treatment . An example is the use of a diet regimen to treat cancer instead of cancer drugs that are prescribed by an oncologist. There may be no scientific evidence to support the complementar y or alternative care like th e rigorous clinical trials and regulatory review process required before a medication is approved for a particular condition. While s ome complementary and alternative therapies have undergone evaluation and have been found to be generally safe , such as a cupuncture, there are others that do not work, may be harmful, or could interact negatively with medicines. Natural does n ot mean safe. Complementary and alternative t herapies include botanicals and nu tritional products, such as herbal and dietary supplements and vitamins , that do not have to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before being sold to the public. There are risks for all types of medicine , including prescriptions , but alternative medicine can be very dangerous if it's used in place of evidence -based treatments . A patient would not get a proven treatment for his or her condition. More needs to be learned about the effects of alternative and complementary products and t reatments and about their safety and potential interactions with medicines . 2021 HB NDHA - Feb. 1, 2021 3 | P a g e In conventional medicine, safety is partly assured by government responsib ility for monitoring the development and safety of pharmaceuticals and new technical procedures, and professional organizations and other government agencies , such as licensing boards, that oversee medical training and safe and ethical medical practice. Health professional societies , training organizations , and hospitals are responsible for the safety of patients and the competence and ethics of professionals working within their confines. Certifying boards also serve an oversight function to regulate various health practices while protecting public welfare. If this bill passed, there would be no required education or training of complementary or alternative care practitioners, no licensing requirement, no criminal history chec k, no complaint or disciplinary process, no regulatory oversight of the \"medicine\" or treatments recommended, no regulation over marketing, and no regulatory body with the authority to shut down an unsafe practitioner. In short, t here would be no protectio ns in place to ensure the safety of people treated with alternative or complementary care. Potential harm to patients comes not only from financial loss due to payment for ineffective treatments, but also due to unproven, possibly harmful treat ments as well as delay in diagnosis and evidence -based treatment. The overly broad reach of the bill and lack of even basic safety requirements is extremely concerning to hospitals. We ask that you give this bill a Do Not Pass recommendation. I would be happy to try to answer any questions you may have. Thank you. Respectfully Submitted, Melissa Hauer, General Counsel North Dakota Hospital Association #4209 HB 1 472 Testimony House Human Services Committee Pioneer Room Chair man Weisz members of the House Human Services Committee for the record my name is Senator Richard Marcellais, District 9, Rolette County. Relating to consumer access to complementary and alternative health care . I appear before you in favor of HB 1472. #4344 1250 Connecticut Ave. NW, #200 www.crossfit.com February 1, 2021 Chair Robin Weisz House HB 1472 (Representatives Ertelt, Schauer, Toman), relating to consumer access to complementary and alternative health care. Dear Chair Weisz and Members of the House Human Services Committee: Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of HB 1472. CrossFit, LLC is the largest gym chain in the country, and is affiliated with more than 15 gyms across the state. Our affiliated gyms are locally-owned and -operated small businesses which provide employment to their owners and trainers, and make their communities healthier. North Dakota's CrossFit gyms play an integral role in fighting the nationwide epidemic of chronic disease, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obesity and more. Their prevention of these diseases diminishes overall health care costs and improves quality of life for hundreds, if not thousands, of North Dakotans. HB 1472 provides clarity on permitted actions performed by those who do not hold themselves out to be medical professionals. As written, it would protect CrossFit trainers who provide individualized nutrition guidance from being considered dietitians or nutritionists if they do not hold themselves out as such. As a fitness method, CrossFit promotes\"Eat[ing] meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar,\" as fundamental for maintaining one's health and fitness. HB 1472, if enacted, will protect CrossFit trainers' ability to provide this and other individualized, effective advice. North Dakota has not escaped the nationwide epidemic of chronic disease. One in eight adults in North Dakota suffers from diabetes. More than one in three adults is obese. Chronic 1 2 diseases reduce quality of life for tens of thousands of North Dakotans, but more importantly, 1 United States Diabetes Surveillance System: https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/diabetes/DiabetesAtlas.html# 2 CDC, Prevalence of Self-Reported Obesity Among U.S. Adults by State and Territory, BRFSS, 2019: https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/prevalence-maps.html #4372chronic diseases take the lives of thousands of North Da kotans each year. CrossFit affiliates are some of the only places in the state where people are preventing these chronic conditions with positive social reinforcement. The state should encourage its residents to become fitter and healthier, not discourage them. It should allow these locally-owne d small businesses to improve their communities. For the reasons stated above CrossFit, LLC supports HB 1472, an d respectfully requests that it be considered by the Committee and reported favor ably. cc: Vice Chair Karen M. Rohr Rep.

Gretchen Dobervich Mary Schneider - contact@holisticcouncil.org - P.O. Box 12331 Burke, VA 22009 Dear Members of the Committee, The Council of Holistic Health Education writes in support of House Bill 1472, which would reduce barriers to entry for nutrition and wellness professionals, while allowing those with a license to continue to practice but without the benefit of a government enforced monopoly. HB 1472 would create a safe harbor so that as long as a professional does not diagnose, treat, or attempt to cure a medical condition, and their clients agree to this in writing, they can work up to the level of their education and training to help others live, eat, and feel better. Our professionals, such as health coaches, athletic trainers, and nutritionists, cannot practice up to the level of their education and training due to North Dakota's strict protectionist laws. The state should consider if licensure protection has done more harm than good, and acts as a reason not to relocate or work in North Dakota. HB 1472 would resolve this by creating a framework to allow more practitioners to be exempt from licensure protectionism, with no repercussions to public health. Our professionals do not diagnose, treat, or cure a medical condition. You will hear horror stories from licensed professions that any change to their vaulted protection will create a public health crisis. Consider this, however: You are being asked to take their word for it, because of privacy and HIPAA, you cannot verify the authenticity of those statements. Consequently, you must weigh the facts between a group with a monopoly that will do anything to protect it, and competition seeking to gain entry into the marketplace. For our professionals, there has never been a case of actual harm from unlicensed providing of food, diet, and nutrition information, guidance, recommendations, and support. If there was a threat of actual harm, we would have seen it by now in one of the 34 states that does not prevent food, diet, and nutrition professionals from practicing with an unfair monopolistic licensure scheme. States like Florida would not have created an exemption to dietetics licensure last year, nor states like Missouri presently considering similar legislation. Many of our professionals - most of them women and small business owners - cannot move to North Dakota because they are excluded from the marketplace by anachronist licensure requirements. Many instead prefer to leave North Dakota for one of the 34 states - like Minnesota - that does not use licensure to unfairly restrict entry into the marketplace. HB 1472 would remove those barriers and offer a chance for anyone who wants to move to North Dakota to pursue their career. It would not jeopardize the job of a licensed practitioner because they would still have their license, but they would not have a government-backed monopoly against competition. According to KFYR on September 10th, 2020 \"North Dakota hospitals have higher costs per person than almost all other states, according to a review by the state's health care committee.\" Alternative and complementary care practitioners would bring that cost down #4532www.HolisticCouncil.org - contact@holisticcouncil.org - P.O. Box 12331 Burke, VA 22009 because they do the hand-holding that so many individuals need after a hospital stay, or a diagnosis requiring a change in diet, and lifestyle. HB 1472 would lower healthcare costs by introducing more professionals into the marketplace to serve more citizens. If North Dakota is serious about lowering its healthcare costs, increasing its population, and creating jobs, then it must consider HB 1472 and other ways to reduce barriers to entry, reduce protectionism that has outlived its usefulness to the citizens, and consider the possibility that competition is a good thing. Next door in Minnesota, 11,000 holistic health and wellness professionals are practicing up to the level of their education and training. They are helping individuals to choose better foods, cook better recipes, make better choices for their health, wellness, and lifestyle. These professionals cannot move to North Dakota if they cannot work, but HB 1472 would create a powerful incentive for them to do so. On behalf of our professionals in North Dakota and nationwide, we ask for the committee to please create opportunities to work by giving competition a chance, and voting to approve HB 1472. Sincerely, Jonathan Posey Executive Director Written Testimony from the North Dakota Board of Dietetic Practice February 1, 2021 In Opposition of HB 1472 Chair Weisz and Members of the House Human Services Committee: The North Dakota Board of Dietetic Practice (NDBOPD) is providing written testimony to oppose HB 1472. NDBODP oversees the licensure of dietitians and nutritionists in the practice of dietetics and provision of nutrition care services in North Dakota. The mission of the NDBODP is to protect the public from being harmed by unqualified persons providing nutrition care services , especially in relation to the treatment of a disease or medical condition. The NDBODP opposes HB 1472 for the following reasons: 1)Complementary and alternative care is not defined in HB 1472 . This bill potentially allows any unlicensed individual to pr ovide nutrition care services for the treatment of a medical condition or disease . Practicing nutrition care services requires a lic ense in North Dakota unless exempt from NDCC Chapter 43 -44. 2)There are no training or education requirements to provide complementary and alternative care. The practice of treating medical conditions and disease does have the potential for harm, and should require the necessary training, education, and/or licensing to do so. 3)Some complementary and alternative therapies have been reported to cause serious pro blems or even deaths (Source: American Cancer Society ). While scientific evidence now exists regarding the effectiveness and safety of some complementary health approaches, there remain many yet -to-be- answered questions about whether others are safe and ef fective. (Source: National Institute of Health: National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health; Sept. 2016). HB 1472 would not provide protections for the consumer from potentially harmful complementary and alternative therapies. The NDBODP urges a \"Do Not Pass\" vote on HB 1472 . It is the board's assertation that complementary and alternative care be provided by healthcare practitioners that are licensed in the state of North Dakota as it falls within their scope of practice, unless there ar e specified ex ceptions within those practice acts for unlicensed individuals . This will provide much needed protections for North Dakota citizens from unqualified individuals that may potentially promote dangerous, costly, or scientifically unproven comple mentary and alternative care approaches. Please c ontact the NDBODP should you have further questions. Thank you. North Dakota Board of Dietetic Practice Board Members Brooke Fredrickson, RDN, LRD, ND HOUSE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE ND BOARD OF CHIROPRACTIC EXAMINERS LETTER OF OPPOSITION Chairman Weisz and Members of the House Human Services Committee, Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in opposition to HB 1472. HB 1472 allows an individual to provide complementary or alternative care. The bill does not provide a definition for the scope of care . With out this definition, how are the North Dakota occupational boards to determine who is honestly providing co mplementary or alternative care vs. someone who may be in violation of the practice of the occupation without a license? Our second concern is that t he bill does not contain a requirement , even minimal, for a ny level of education or experience for the individual providing the complementary or alternative care. Is the protection of the public a concern if individuals are permitted to practice complementary or alternative care without \"any\" degrees, training, experience, credentials, or other qualificatio ns? Further, the bill does not include what agency is responsible for enforcing the prohibited acts and disclosures include d. Whom does the public refer their questions, concerns, or possible complaints to? For the questions above, the North Dakota Board of Chiropractic Examiners opposes HB 1472. We are available to answer any questions the committee may have or to provide you with any additional information you may seek. Thank you.
