Summarize this article for a 10 years old Homeopathy or homoeopathy is a [pseudoscientific](/en/Pseudoscientific) [[1]](#cite_note-1) system of [alternative medicine](/en/Alternative_medicine). It was conceived in 1796 by the German physician [Samuel Hahnemann](/en/Samuel_Hahnemann). Its practitioners, called homeopaths, believe that a substance that causes symptoms of a disease in healthy people can cure similar symptoms in sick people; this doctrine is called [similia similibus curentur](/en/Similia_similibus_curentur), or \"like cures like\".

Often not even a single molecule of the original substance can be expected to remain in the product.

Practitioners claim that such preparations, upon oral intake, can treat or cure physics, chemistry, biochemistry and biology contradicts homeopathy.

[[6]](#cite_note-shang-6) [[7]](#cite_note-pmid124926032-7) [[8]](#cite_note-inquiry_4504-8) Its theory of disease, centered around principles Hahnemann termed [miasms](#Miasms_and_disease), is inconsistent with subsequent identification of viruses and bacteria as [causes of disease](/en/Germ_theory_of_disease). Clinical trials have been conducted and generally demonstrated no objective effect from homeopathic preparations.

[[13]](#cite_note-Baran2014-13) [[14]](#cite_note-Walport-Nonsense-14) [[15]](#cite_note-oxcompus-15) Homeopathy achieved its greatest popularity in the 19th century. It was introduced to the United States in 1825, and the first American homeopathic school opened in 1835. Throughout the 19th century, dozens of homeopathic institutions appeared in Europe and the United States. During this period, homeopathy was able to appear relatively successful, as other forms of treatment could be harmful and ineffective. By the end of the century the practice began to wane, with the last exclusively homeopathic medical school in the United States closing in 1920. During the 1970s, homeopathy made a significant comeback, with sales of some homeopathic products increasing tenfold. The trend corresponded with the rise of the [New Age movement](/en/New_Age_movement), and may be in part due to [chemophobia](/en/Chemophobia), an irrational aversion to synthetic chemicals, and the longer consultation times homeopathic practitioners provided. In the 21st century, a series of [meta-analyses](/en/Meta-analysis) have shown that the therapeutic claims of homeopathy lack scientific justification. As a result, national and international bodies have recommended the withdrawal of government funding for homeopathy in healthcare. National bodies from Australia, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and France, as well as the [European Academies' Science Advisory Council](/en/European_Academies'_Science_Advisory_Council) and the [Russian Academy of Sciences](/en/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences) have all concluded that homeopathy is ineffective, and recommended against the practice receiving any further funding.
