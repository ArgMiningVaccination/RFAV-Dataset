Multidrug-Resistant Organisms (MDROs) can cause infections that are difficult to treat. An MDRO is a germ that has become resistant to one or more classes of antibiotics. This means that infections caused by an MDRO are harder to treat with antibiotics. MDROs are becoming more common, but there are ways to prevent these germs from spreading and ways to prevent new drug-resistant germs from emerging. T o help prevent infections: Get Vaccinated. RWJBarnabas Health employees are offered a number of vaccines to prevent illness, which keeps our staff healthy and lowers the risk of spreading infections to you. V accines also are available to you and are encouraged. Speak to your doctor or nurse should you have any questions about vaccines. Contain Germs. If you are found to carry a germ that could cause infections in other patients, visitors and staff, we will place you on certain precautions in a private room to prevent the spread of germs to others. Staff and visitors will wear protective equipment such as gowns, gloves and/or masks to prevent spreading germs to others in the hospital. Check tubes and drains. Urinary catheters, IVs and other tubes and drains are sometimes needed for your care, but they also can provide a route for germs to enter your body. While in the hospital, our staff will assess and care for them routinely to help prevent infections, and will remove when no longer needed for your care. After Prevention Comes Treatment It is not always needed to treat an infection with an antibiotic; sometimes a wound can be cleaned out and it will heal without any need for antibiotic therapy. If you have an infection that needs to be treated with antibiotics, our laboratory can use the samples taken from blood, urine, stool and wounds to assess which antibiotics are the best for treatment.Stay Safe continued Diagnosis Our lab can identify drug-resistant organisms taken from samples of blood, urine, stool and wounds. X-rays and other tests also can help us to identify infections from areas in the body where it is difficult to obtain lab samples. Tell your doctor about signs and symptoms that you have, and if you know that you carry or have had infections from an MDRO such as Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) or Clostridium Difficile, which is referred to most times as C. Diff. Remember to ask your nurse or doctor if you have any questions about how to stay safe. www.rwjbh.org/jerseycity 201-915-2000 : 19What Are Your Advance Directives? Advance Directives Y ou have the right to make decisions about your own medical treatment. These decisions become more difficult if, due to illness or a change in mental condition, you are unable to tell your doctor and loved ones what kind of healthcare treatments you want. That is why it is important for you to make your wishes known in advance. Contact a patient advocate for assistance. If you did not bring your advance di- rective with you to the hospital, please h ave your family or trusted friend bring it to the hospital for your record. Here is a brief description of each kind of directive: Living Will A set of instructions documenting your wishes about life-prolonging medical care. It is used if you become terminally ill, incapacitated or unable to commu - nicate or make decisions. A living will protects your rights to accept or refuse medical care and removes the burden of making decisions from your family, friends and medical professionals. Healthcare Proxy A person (agent) you appoint to make your medical decisions if you are unable to do so. Choose someone you know well and trust to carry out your wishes. Be sure to discuss this with the person before naming him or her as your agent. Remember that an agent may have to use his or her judgment in the event of a medical decision for which your wishes aren't known. A healthcare proxy is especially important if you have no close family or your most trusted friend or companion is not your next-of-kin. Bioethics Consultation Service Y ou have the right to contact our Ethics Committee on any ethical concern during your hospital stay. The Ethics Committee may help when you or your family is uncertain or confused about what course of action to take\u2014such as what should family members do when they disagree about what is best for the patient; when should life-prolonging treatments be started, continued or stopped. Y ou may contact the Ethics Committee through the patient advo - cate or palliative care nurse practitioner. There is no fee for these services. Palliative Care Program W e have a Palliative Care Program run by a board-certified geriatrician and palliative care nurse practitioner. Y ou have the right to ask your physician to contact our team so it can provide you and your family with the information and guidance your need to explore your options for palliative care.What Are Advance Directives? An advance directive is a document that allows you to direct who will make healthcare decisions for you and to state your wishes for medical treatment if you become unable to decide for yourself. Your advance directive may be used to accept or refuse any procedure or treatment, including life-sustaining treatment. You do not need a lawyer to complete advance directives.20 : 201-915-2000 www.rwjbh.org/jerseycity Your Privacy & Information Privacy & Your Health Information Y ou have privacy rights under a federal law that protect your health information.

Antibiotic resistance can cause illnesses that were once easily treatable with antibiotics to become dangerous infections that are difficult to kill, expensive to treat and in some cases, can lead to serious disability or even death. Every time a person takes antibiotics, sensitive bacteria (bacteria that antibiotics still can attack) are killed, but resistant bacteria are left to grow and multiply. Antibiotics are not effective against viral infections like the common cold, flu, and most sore throats. Widespread use of antibiotics for these illnesses is an example of how overuse of antibiotics can promote the spread of antibiotic resistance. Smart use of antibiotics is key to controlling the spread of resistance. Here is what you can do to help prevent antibiotic resistance: n T ake the prescribed antibiotic exactly as your healthcare professional tells you. n N ever take an antibiotic for a viral infection like a cold or the flu. n N ever pressure your healthcare professional to prescribe an antibiotic. Our Antimicrobial Stewardship Program at Jersey City Medical Center, led by an infectious disease physician and an antimicrobial stewardship pharmacist, strives to help prevent resistance by providing education to our staff and establishing policies that support appropriate antibiotic use. Our goal is to ensure that all our patients only receive antibiotics when they need them and always the right antibiotic, at the right dose, for the right duration.

T o help your loved one make the best decisions about his or her care and treatment, follow the advice in the caregiver list at right. While you are making sure that your loved one's needs are being met, don't neglect your own. Caregiving is a stressful and time-consuming job. Y ou may neglect your diet, your normal exercise routine and your sleep needs. Y ou may find that you have little or no time to spend with friends, relax or just be by yourself for a while.

Jersey City Medical Center's Patient Navigation Program offers additional support to the caregivers. This is a home program for caregivers of family members with multiple chronic diseases. It includes survey tools to identify caregiver strain, as well as barriers to good outcomes (i.e. fall potential, hearing and vision problems, cognitive and toileting concerns) and attaches next steps/solutions to identified barriers. Caretakers also earn reward points for their participation. For more information about this service, please call 201-388-1290 or visit us online at www.rwjbh.org/jerseycity.
