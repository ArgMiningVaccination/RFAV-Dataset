Vaccine schedules include immunizations against contagious diseases such as measles, mumps, and pertussis, to name a few. You may have wondered how these recommendations are developed. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is a group of medical and public health experts that develop recommendations on the routine administration and scheduling of vaccines for infants, children, teens and adults. They work with medical organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American College of Physicians. Together, they determine the appropriate age of the child or adult, timing of vaccines, number of doses needed and safety precautions. The ACIP submits their recommendations to the CDC for review. Upon approval, the CDC then publishes them for use in the U.S. To see what is recommended for you or your children check out the links below for vaccine dosing schedules per age group: Keep in mind that vaccines are not recommended in certain cases, such as in those with an allergy to an ingredient in the vaccine, or in people with weakened immune systems due to an illness or condition (e.g., cancer, transplant). Speak with your healthcare professional about your vaccine schedule and remember to keep track of your appointments. References - 1. Centers for Disease Control. ACIP recommendations.
