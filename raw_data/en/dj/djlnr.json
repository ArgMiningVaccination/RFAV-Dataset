Two different projects: - Characterization of the inhibitory neuron population around entorhinal cortex layer II neurons the most vulnerable neurons in Alzheimer's disease. Entorhinal cortex layer II neurons are thought to be regulated by a very strong inhibitory drive that decreases with Alzheimer's. The particular interneuron type involved is not well understood. We want to identify the interneuron population most salient for layer II neurons by performing a detailed anatomical characterization of interneurons of the region. For this, we will analyze previously generated single-nucleus RNAseq data from entorhinal cortex, and will use multiplex situ hybridization and immunofluorescence, to identify the interneuron subtypes that are most closely associated to the vulnerable neurons. - investigation of the mRNA targets for a miRNA that is enriched in entorhinal cortex layer II neurons, is downregulated in Alzheimer's disease, and could be a major regulator of excitability in these cells. The project will involve cell-based assays as well as detection of the miRNA using in situ hybridization on mouse brain The research focuses on modulators of the medial temporal hippocampal system across the human lifespan, including aging, psychosocial and physiological stress, and lifestyle factors, such as exercise. Research Projects Goals: We are currently starting up two new 5-year projects that have the goal to understand the impact of racism burden on brain and mental health in Black/African American adults from a cognitive neuroscience perspective.

[Joanne Murabito](mailto:murabito@bu.edu) [BU Profile](https://profiles.bu.edu/Joanne.Murabito) [Medicine: Endocrinology, Diabetes, Nutrition The Role of Nuclear Corepressors NCoR1 and SMRT on Intestinal Metabolism in the Adult Mouse Project goals: - To determine the role of NCoR1 and SMRT on intestinal glucose and fructose metabolism - To determine NCoR1/SMRT genomic recruitment and key transcription factors/nuclear receptors involved in glucose and fructose metabolism Project Background: Thyroid hormone (TH) plays an essential role in maintaining homeostasis and regulating metabolism in all organ systems beginning with embryogenesis and continuing throughout life. TH action is mediated by the thyroid hormone receptor (TR), which is a nuclear receptor, and it's coregulators. The nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1) and the silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) are two critical corepressors of the TR that inhibit gene transcription in the absence of TH. Repression is mediated by complexing with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), which is stabilized by NCoR1 and NCoR1 and SMRT are critical for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and we have recently reported the post-natal knock-out (KO) of NCoR1 and SMRT in tandem is not survivable and rapidly leads to weight loss, hypoglycemia, and hypothermia. Additionally, thyroid function shows non-thyroidal like illness with low free thyroxine levels. Further analysis suggested intestinal abnormalities including increase fecal caloric density which required exploration. To further evaluate the intestinal findings, we used a tamoxifen-inducible villin Cre recombinase (VE-Cre-ERT2) to KO both NCoR1 and SMRT throughout the intestine. Mice were injected with tamoxifen at 8 weeks of age and metabolic parameters, including weight, glucose, and temperature were monitored. These mice then underwent both oral and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance testing (GTT) and metabolic phenotyping. Our preliminary data shows that intestinal KO of NCoR1 and SMRT leads to sustained weight loss up and hypoglycemia up to three weeks after tamoxifen injections. NCoR1 and SMRT double-KO is survivable in approximately 50% of mice. Oral GTT showed a blunted peak response to administration of glucose compared to intraperitoneal administration. Gene expression analysis showed alterations in intestinal carbohydrate transporters, including sodium-glucose transporters (SGLTs). Students will be mentored by myself and the other faculty and post-doctoral fellows in the lab including Dr. Sousa and Dr. Mendoza. We have lab meetings with Dr. Hollenberg. Type of Basic Science [Megan Jean Continuous glucose monitoring: determinants and prediction of diabetes mellitus development in the [Framingham Heart Study](https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/). The goal of this project is to collect continuous glucose monitoring data in a healthy community-based sample to determine whether patterns identified in the rise and fall of glucose levels throughout the day can help predict risk of developing diabetes mellitus. Through linking patterns of dynamic glucose levels with diet and physical activity (among other factors like genetics, bacteria in the gut, and the prevalence of cardiovascular disease), this project may also lead to new discoveries that will tailor and target prevention of diabetes mellitus.

Holick](mailto:mfholick@bu.edu) [BU Profile](https://profiles.bu.edu/Michael.Holick) Title: Impact of Midlife and Late-life Intake of Flavonoid-rich Fruits on Dementia Risk in the Framingham Heart Study Research Project: This project aims to investigate whether intake of fruits high in flavonoids in midlife and late-life are associated with reduced risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Most studies to date focus on consumption of flavonoid-rich foods in older adults or during late-life, with findings to suggest that greater consumption of flavonoid-rich foods and fruits, such as blueberries, may reduce cognitive decline and dementia risk. Evidence from epidemiologic studies to support greater consumption of flavonoids earlier in life, such as midlife, in relation to dementia risk and cognitive decline is more limited, however. Despite the lack of epidemiologic studies looking at the impact of dietary intake of flavonoids earlier in life on the development of dementia, preclinical and animal studies provide evidence of the neurocognitive benefits of flavonoid-rich foods as early as childhood and adolescence. This suggests that greater consumption of fruits high in flavonoid content earlier in life may be as important or perhaps more important on lowering future dementia risk than later in life. To test this hypothesis, we will leverage data collected on dietary fruit consumption from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), which is a longitudinal, community-based cohort that has a rich collection of brain aging-related outcomes, including clinical diagnosis of dementia. An important aspect of FHS that is relevant to the objective of this project is that the age range of participants who enrolled in FHS generally spans from early adulthood (e.g., 20s-30s) to late-life (e.g., >65 years). This means that information on diet and specific foods, such as blueberries, is available to enable an analysis across different age periods. Coupled with dementia surveillance that has been ongoing since 1976, FHS is an ideal setting to study the impact of dietary fruit intake, especially fruits high in flavonoids, in midlife and late-life on the development of dementia. Findings from the project will advance understanding on whether the potential benefits of flavonoid-rich fruits on the brain and cognition are similar across different age periods, or whether greater dietary flavonoid intake from fruits at specific age periods, such as midlife or late-life, confers more benefits than compared to other age periods. This knowledge will help with promoting blueberries and other flavonoid-rich fruits as potential contributors to healthy brain aging.

Type of Research: Basic Title: Novel Plasma Exosome Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer Progression in Co-morbid Metabolic Disease Research Project: Novel plasma exosome biomarkers for prostate cancer progression in co-morbid metabolic disease. Comorbid Type 2 diabetes (T2D), a metabolic complication of obesity, is prevalent among BMC cancer patients and associates with worse cancer outcomes for prostate, breast, head and neck, colorectal and several other solid tumors. However, the molecular mechanisms that explain these associations remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence shows that exosomes carry miRNAs in blood that encode the metabolic status of originating tissues and deliver their cargo to target tissues to modulate expression of critical genes. Exosomal communication potentially connects abnormal metabolism to cancer progression. New data support the hypothesis that T2D plasma exosomes induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in prostate cancer cells and drive disease progression. We recently showed that plasma exosomes from BMC subjects with T2D induce EMT features in prostate cancer cells. We demonstrated that specific exosomal miRNAs that are differentially abundant in plasma of T2D adults compared to nondiabetic controls (e.g., miR374a-5p, miR-93-5p and let-7b-3p) are delivered to cancer cells, thereby regulating critical target genes. Our previous reports show BRD4 controls migration and dissemination of castration-resistant prostate cancer, and transcription of key EMT genes; T2D exosomes require BRD4 to drive EMT. We validated our findings with gene set enrichment analysis of human genomic data from prostate tumor tissue. These results suggest novel, non-invasive biomarkers, and new approaches to evaluate and potentially block progression of prostate and other cancers, will benefit prostate cancer patients with comorbid T2D and refine clinical decision making. This NCI-supported project will investigate patient plasma exosomes, considering clinical variables like diabetes duration, metabolic medications, glucose control and demographic variables like age and race, to understand exosomal miRNA composition and how it relates to prostate cancer progression in patients with comorbid obesity and diabetes. Time Commitment: Per week, 2 - 3 days of commitment to bench research (10 hours) will be minimally required to make acceptable progress.

Our lab focuses on the cardiovascular disease at the intersection of other organ pathology. We use a range of models including cell-based models, animal models (mice, rats, zebrafish, rabbits and pigs) and strive to confirm our hypothesis in humans. Also, there are on-going clinical studies using novel devices to address key bottlenecks in the area of cardiovascular disease. Prospective students can choose projects under these three domains: - Cardiovascular complications in patients with chronic kidney disease: CVD burden is high in CKD patients, and hence our work probes the profound effects of CKD (uremia) on vascular diseases in these patients (uremic vascular disease). CKD is characterized by the retention of several metabolites called uremic toxins, which inflict organ damage including, cardiovascular complications. Leveraging cellular and molecular techniques, animal models such as rodents, zebrafish and pigs, we attempt to dissect the mechanism of toxicity of these solutes. We strive to validate those hypotheses in human subjects using various techniques including machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence. - Angiogenesis and cancer: Cancer progresses through several steps characterized by a conversion of normal tissue states to anaplasia and neoplasia. While the tumor continues to grow in a conducive environment, it draws leash of blood vessels along with it. Angiogenesis, a process of generation of novel blood vessels is fundamental during the development and in various diseases such as cancer. Wnt signaling, a highly conserved oncogenic pathway. We examine the details of this pathway in fundamental understanding how Wnt signaling is regulated in various cancers. - Biomedical engineering approach addressing kidney problems: The era of precision medicine warrants a multi-pronged approach to develop better biomarkers or therapeutic targets. Leveraging a rich interdisciplinary network of biomedical engineers, computation biologists, synthetic chemists, polymer chemists and health economists.

Several specific neuropeptides present within the healthy eye regulate different immune cells and different immune cell functions. Collectively, they suppress inflammation and promote immune cell-mediated anti-inflammatory activity and immune-tolerance. Understanding how these neuropeptides alter immunity and work together to suppress inflammation profoundly impacts finding ways to reestablish health in the eyes following infection, graft rejection, autoimmune disease, and trauma. Our experimental approach uses molecular biology, biochemistry, histology, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, gene delivery, cultured immune cells, and immune model techniques.

Our studies also revealed that obesogenic diet feeding induces alternation of hematopoiesis with a dramatic increase of pro-inflammatory neutrophil production and pro-inflammatory phenotype in mice. Interestingly, mice lacking neutrophil-specific protease neutrophil elastase are resistant not only but also to inflammation and fibrosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and insulin resistance. We are in the process to study how nutritional factors are involved in the regulation of neutrophil differentiation, immune cell interactions with vascular wall and tissue-resident cells, and how these processes are related to the development of systemic inflammation, NASH, adipose tissue fibrotic remodeling, and metabolic disorders. - Neutrophils play a pivotal role in obesity-related vascular injury and vascular aging. Our study revealed that neutrophils contribute to obesity-related vascular leakage and immune cell infiltration in adipose tissue by releasing neutrophil elastase. The latter increases vascular permeability through activating protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) signaling in vascular endothelial cells. Our recent studies also revealed that neutrophils are involved in vascular aging and related arterial stiffness. We are currently investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms by which obesity and aging regulate the interactions between neutrophils and vascular cells. We are applying cell culture and animal models to our study using a variety of basic techniques. We encourage medical students to visit the lab and discuss potential projects.

Type of Research: Title: Telomere Elongation is a Requisite for Cellular Immortality and a Hallmark of Cancer Cells Laboratory Research Focus: Most cancer cells rely on reactivation of the enzyme telomerase or activation of the alternative lengthening of telomeres pathway (ALT) to promote telomere elongation. The prevalence of ALT across all cancers is approximately 10%, however the prevalence of ALT in cancers of neuroepithelial and mesenchymal origin are estimated to be over 50%. These cancers have poor overall survival and treatment options that have remained static for approximately 40 years. While several therapeutic modalities have shown promise in the lab, there are currently no clinical trials specifically for the treatment of ALT positive cancers. Therefore, defining the molecular underpinnings of ALT activity could not only identify genetic vulnerabilities in the ALT pathway, but drive therapeutic development for the treatment of ALT positive cancers. Mechanistically, the ALT pathway relies on homologous recombination to promote telomere elongation. Although it is unclear exactly how the recombinogenic state of ALT telomeres is established, intrinsically high levels of replication stress within telomeric DNA are believe to contribute to the process. The repetitive nature and structural complexities within telomeric DNA pose a challenge to the replication machinery increasing replication stress within this region. These challenges are thought to be exacerbated at ALT telomeres by defects in nucleosome assembly and chromatin compaction caused by genetic mutations in the histone chaperone complex ATRX/DAXX. This chronic replication stress is thought to drive replication fork collapse and ultimately, the formation of one-ended DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at ALT telomeres. These telomeric DSBs are repaired through a recombination process known as break induced replication (BIR) which drives the telomere elongation observed in the ALT pathway. Replication stress is a catchall term that broadly describes any impediment to the replication machinery, but the true nature of the stress and the structures generated at the fork dictate repair choice. Our lab, and others, have demonstrated that ALT telomeres demonstrate an increase in telomeric ssDNA. Nevertheless, exactly how this ssDNA is generated and where this ssDNA is located has not been fully defined. ssDNA is bound by RPA and this nucleoprotein structure serves as a platform for the recruitment of the replication stress response kinase ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related). Once is activated by TOPBP1 (DNA topoisomerase II binding protein 1) and ETAA1 (Ewing's tumor-associated antigen 1) proteins to regulate distinct downstream repair and checkpoint activities. Recently, we demonstrated that ETAA1 and TOPBP1 are required for ALT activity and function to differentially regulate the DNA damage response at ALT telomeres. Given that ALT telomeres experience chronic replication stress, we speculate that defects in the kinetics of DNA replication drive activation of the replication stress response pathway to maintain ALT activity. Therefore, we hypothesize that defects in DNA replication expose ssDNA at stalled replication forks driving DNA DSBs and triggering a replication stress response that perpetuates ALT activity. - Specific Aim 1: Defining the dynamics of DNA replication at ALT telomeres. ALT telomeres demonstrate an increase in replication stress, yet little is known about the etiology of this stress. We hypothesize that increased replication fork pausing and/or stalling coupled with decreased replication initiation events within the repeats themselves leads to incomplete DNA synthesis at ALT telomeres. Therefore, in this aim we will use molecular combing assays combined with long read nanopore sequencing to analyze the kinetics of replication initiation and fork progression at telomeric DNA. - Specific Aim 2: Defining DNA damage tolerance pathways at ALT telomeres. ALT telomeres are prone to DNA damage on the leading strand suggesting challenges to the replication machinery during DNA synthesis. Replication stress on the leading strand drives a competition between replication fork remodeling and replication fork repriming activities. While these DNA damage tolerance pathways help resolve replication stress, they can also lead to an increase in ssDNA. Therefore, in this aim we will identify the DNA damage tolerance pathways at ALT telomeres and use molecular combing assays to analyze the accumulation and location of ssDNA at telomeric DNA at single-molecule resolution. This project would be a research-intensive experience (heavy molecular focus) for someone truly interested in the molecular mechanisms regulating telomere maintenance in the context of cancer. Initially, I would provide the bulk of the training, but I do have a second- year graduate student who could support individuals in the lab.
