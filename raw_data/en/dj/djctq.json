Our objective was to estimate incidence over four epidemic waves in a slum in Rio de Janeiro, a proxy for economically deprived areas in the Global South. Methods Prospective cohort of children and household contacts screened for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR and serology (IgG). The incidence density of PCR positive infections estimated for each wave - the rst wave, Zeta, Gamma and Delta - was compared to an index combining NPIs and vaccination coverage. Findings 718 families and 2501 individuals were enrolled, from May 2020 to November 2021. The incidence density of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the rst wave was 2, 3 times that of the other waves. The incidence among childrenwas lower than that of older participants, except in later waves, when vaccination of the elderly reached 90%. House-hold agglomeration was signicantly associated with incidence only during the rst wave. Interpretation The incidence of infection greatly exceeded rates reported in similar cohorts. The observed reduction in incidence in the elderly during the Delta variant wave, in spite of the rollback of NPIs, can be attributed to increased vaccine coverage. The high incidence in young people reinforces the importance of vaccination in this agegroup, a policy that has yet to receive the full support of some sectors of society.

Evaluatingrates of new infections in a cohort can provide data toinform vaccination strategies and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). As discussed below, while many studies have estimated the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 incohorts in Europe and North America 14relatively little is known about incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the Global South.An important development in the SARS-CoV-2 pan- demic has been the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs) that may result in higher rates of transmission or reinfection than the rst wave lineages.5,6A number of studies have estimated SARS-CoV-2 incidence over one particular epidemic wave.14However, there is no data about rates of new SARS-CoV-2 cases in low-income, high population density areas during the period of circulation of different SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Little is known about the extent to which, if any, theincidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection changes from oneSARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave to another in such areas, and if so, why. *Corresponding author.

To control COVID-19, Rio de Janeiro implemented NPIs including the closure of schools, cancellation of public events during the New Year 's Eve and Carnival seasons, and mandatory use of face masks, amongothers. Economic support for low-income families waslimited to approximately US$100 per month from April 2020 to August 2020, and half this value for the next four months. This support was made available againbeginning in April 2021 for the following ve months. Schools for children ages 5 15 reopened partially and gradually beginning in August 2021 and fully inNovember 2021. Vaccination began on 20 January 2021 for the elderly and health professionals and gradually expanded to other age groups. Vaccination of adoles-cents 12 17 years old began in August 2021. Like 60 other countries in the Global South, Brazil's economy is characterized by elevated indices of income inequality. 9Nevertheless, when formulating NPIs, gov- ernments often adopt a \"one size ts all\" approach with- out accounting for the effect of income on the capacity to comply with COVID-19 control measures.10There may be far fewer resources available to sustain house- holds in low-income communities, affecting the pop- ulation's willingness to comply with NPIs.Understanding the main drivers of SARS-CoV-2 inci- dence in low-income communities and how they may have changed over the two years of the pandemic mayprovide valuable information to decision-makers for for-mulating future NPIs and immunization priorities. Such policies are likely to be necessary for the foresee- able future, as SARS-COV-2 may persist in human pop-ulations for a prolonged period. The objective of this study was to estimate the inci- dence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of childrenand household contacts in a slum in Rio de Janeiro. We calculated the incidence density for each of the four pan- demic waves between April 2020 and September 2021,accounting for age and household clustering. Methods Recruitment and follow-up of participants The present investigation, which was built upon ouraccompaniment of previous cohorts in this commu- nity, 1114is part of an ongoing prospective SARS-CoV-2 study.15We offered study participation to all household contacts of children aged 13 and under who were seen at a primary health care centre for any reason including routine vaccinations and preventative care. The centreprovides primary care to 4300 children in this age group per month. After enrolment, we collected samples in each household on study days 1 (rst visit), 14 and 28,every three months during the rst year, and twice inthe second year. Enrolment took place from theResearch in context Evidence before the study We searched PubMed and Web of Science for publica- tions on SARS-CoV-2 incidence density, publishedbetween 1 March 2020 and 26 February 2022. We used the keywords \"incidence density \"and \"SARS-CoV-2 \"and searched for articles in English, French, Spanish and Por-tuguese. Cohort studies have estimated the incidencedensity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in families in the US and health care workers in India and Ethiopia, for the most part during the rst wave of the COVID-19 pan- demic. However, little is known about the incidencedensity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in families in low- resource, high household density communities, where compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions(NPIs) such as lockdowns is unfeasible due to food insecurity. Added value of this study The objective of this study was to estimate the inci- dence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of children and household contacts for each of the four waves ofthe pandemic between April 2020 and September 2021,accounting for age and household clustering. Our study participants reside in a community in Rio de Janeiro with high levels of poverty and violence. Ours is one ofthe few studies to characterize the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in this setting. We evaluated incidence in relation to the stringency index \u2014a scale for evaluating the adoption of NPIs in the city \u2014and vaccination coverage by age group. Implications of all the available evidence The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in families in a low- resource community in Rio de Janeiro was higher than in household cohorts in the US and among healthcare workers in India and Ethiopia. While the incidence ofSARS-CoV-2 in children in our cohort was generallylower than that of older participants, the incidence in children increased later in the epidemic. In Brazil, immu- nization of children against SARS-CoV-2 continues to beopposed by some sectors of civil society and the gov-ernment. Our ndings highlight how important it is for the Brazilian government to stand behind the policy of vaccinating children despite political opposition.Articles 2 www.thelancet.com Vol 12 Month August, 2022beginning of the pandemic on May 15, 2020, to Novem- ber 14, 2021. Nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva were screened for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR to amplify the E gene and the RdRp region of the Orf1ab gene of SARS-CoV-2 using the SARS-CoV-2 E/RP molecular kit (Bio-Man-guinhos, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Cycle thresholds (Ct)less than 40 were classied as positive. Serum tests were performed to screen for IgG antibodies by a Micro- particle Chemiluminescent Immunoassay (CMIA), tar-geting the S gene (Abbott IL, USA). SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and IgG serology assays were performed on all study participants at every visitaccording to the manufacturer's instructions. The study was approved by institutional review boards at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation and the LondonSchool of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Case de nition and covariates A new SARS-CoV-2 infection was dened as a positive RT-PCR test. Seropositive results were not considered as new infections, as the precise date of seroconversionwas not available. For the rst three months of the study, however, as there was no previous contact with SARS-CoV-2, seropositive cases were also consideredincident infections. Incidence density was dened as the number of new SARS-CoV-2 cases per 1000 person weeks of exposure. In each period, the disease-free observation period foreach participant was dened as the duration of observa- tion during the period in question plus two additional weeks. The two extra weeks were included to accountfor the maximum interval for SARS-CoV-2 transmis- sion, and the detection of infection by the study team. The at-risk time was truncated at the beginning and theend of each period if the follow-up spanned more thanone period. Households in which no individual was examined during an entire wave were considered lost to follow-upafter eight unsuccessful contact attempts by telephone and smartphone messaging apps. Individuals in each household who missed one or more study visits wereexcluded only if the study team was unable to contact the participant during an entire wave. During the study period, young people and adults were eligible for vaccina-tion, following a schedule dened by the municipal health department. The rst age group eligible for vacci- nation was older adults. Children under 12 were not eligi-ble to be vaccinated during the study period. Therefore,the at-risk time was truncated after the rst dose. To dene the start and end of each epidemic wave, we determined the number of cases per week in wave t.T h e week with the lowest number of cases during a wave t was dened as the beginning of the next wave, ( t+1). Dur- ing each wave t, multiple lineages were detected bygenomic surveillance. We named each wave tbased on the predominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage during the wave. Age was included in the model divided into catego- ries based on the age groups targeted by vaccination campaigns in Rio de Janeiro: 0 4, 511, 1217, 1859, and sixty and older. In addition, we evaluated householdclustering, dened as the ratio of the number of personsliving in the household and the number of rooms, as the most relevant variable to estimate the incidence in the cohort. Complementary indicators Stringency index. The Stringency Index was developed to track and compare policy responses around the world, combining indicators in four domains: Contain-ment and Closure, Economic Response, Health Sys- tems, and Vaccine Policies. 16This indicator ranges from 0 representing no control measures to 100, whichcorresponds to complete lockdown. The index does notcorrelate specically with incidence. Instead, it is an overall indicator of health authorities' responses to fac- tors including local trends in incidence, mortality, hos-pital capacity, and economic demands. In Brazil, the variables were available for the capitals of each state. The data set is available from https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/covid-19- government-response-tracker. 17 Vaccination coverage. The Brazilian Health Ministry data on vaccination by age group was obtained by tabu- lating the open-source data from the COVID-19 vaccina- tion information system (SI-PNI) available fromhttps://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset/covid-19-vaci-nacao as of February 2, 2022. Genomic data. All genomic data from Rio de Janeiro evaluated in this study is available in the EpiCoV data-base at GISAID (www.gisaid.org) produced by the COVID-19 Fiocruz Genomic Surveillance Network and other genomic initiatives in Brazil. Details about geno-mic surveillance can be found at http://www.genomah- cov.ocruz.br/dashboard-en/. Statistical models. As the response variable is infection vs non-infection, we used a logistic model to estimatethe odds of each variable. In addition to age, which was included a priori , we also evaluated the signicance of variables at the household level. Since the models werevery similar according to the Watanabe Akaike infor- mation criterion (WAIC), 18in addition to age, we chose a variable representing household clustering (persons/Articles www.thelancet.com Vol 12 Month August, 2022 3room), which we considered the most relevant indicator of housing conditions in the study site. The individualswho were included in the odds ratio calculation and who had sufcient follow-up time were retained in the incidence density calculation. The probability of a participant being an incident infection is given by the expected value of the aforemen- tioned logistic model. The duration of follow-up variesfrom participant to participant. Therefore, the estimated incidence density is the sum of the probability of being a SARS-CoV-2 positive or negative case, given the dura-tion of follow-up of all the participants in each wave. The global incidence of infection in each wave is the expected number of infections including both SARS-CoV-2 detections by RT-PCR and seroconversion,divided by the number of people exposed in each wave. In addition, we tested the inclusion of two random effects to account for the expected dependence betweenindividuals living in the same household and for the unstructured individual variability to account for unknown confounders ( Supplemental Material ). Role of the funding source. The funders had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, interpreta- tion, writing of the report or decision to submit. Results Table 1 summarizes the sociodemographic prole of all participants according to the wave in which they were recruited. The interquartile range of age was similar across the epidemic waves. However, the median agewas signicantly lower in the Delta wave and higher in the Zeta wave ( Supplemental Material ). The age group that comprised the highest proportion of the cohort wasworking-age adults, which along with adolescents, rep- resented 58% of those recruited. The majority of partici- pants were women (60%). The total number of examswas greater during the rst wave and similar for the fol-lowing ones. Positive PCR ranged between 12 and 17%between the rst three waves and decreased substan- tially in the Delta wave. A total of 718 families were enrolled in the study; 40.5% were recruited in the rst epidemic wave and approximately 20% in each of the subsequent ones.Concerning families recruited during the Zeta, Gamma and Delta waves, the proportion of families retained in subsequent waves was similar to the pattern observedamong families recruited during the rst wave. By the end of the study, 93.2% of the participants aged 12 and older who were eligible to be vaccinated had received atleast one dose of a vaccine. The at-risk period and out- comes for each participant (RT-PCR and serology tests, and immunization) are summarized in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S3. Figure 2 displays the four COVID-19 waves in Rio de Janeiro superimposed on a graph of the Stringency Index. During the initial three months, at the beginningof the epidemic, the value of the Stringency Index was indicative of lock-down. However, by the end of the rst wave, these measures were relaxed, and the index oscil-lated between 60 and 70 points through the end of the Gamma wave. During the Delta wave, relatively few NPIs were implemented but the stringency index tickedup due to the rollout of vaccination. Four months afterthe start of vaccination, complete vaccination coverage among the elderly reached 60% ( Figure 3 ). By the Delta wave, complete vaccination coverage reached 90% inthis group. Vaccination of working-age adults coincided with the beginning of the Delta wave. By the end of the study period, complete vaccination coverage of working-age adults reached 90%. The vaccination of adolescents began in September 2021. Children 5 11 years of age were not vaccinated during the study period. Sixteen models were evaluated ( Supplementary Table S2). The model with the best WAIC score included just the family random effect. Figure 4 shows the odds ratio and credible intervals (0.025 and 0.975 quantiles) forthe variables age group and household clustering. Compared to the working-age population (19 59 years of age), the odds ratio for children 0 4 years of age had a signicant protective effect during the ZetaVariable Overall, N= 455 Median age in years (IQR) 21 (8-37) 19 (5-37) 25 (8-37) 22 (9-38) 17 (8-34) Age categories N (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) 0 to 4 years 408 (16%) 191 (22%) 79 (15%) 79 (12%) 59 (13%) 167 (19%) 96 (19%) 126 (20%) 114 years (10.0%) 74 (8.4%) 37 (7.1%) 76 (12%) 63 (14%) 397 (45%) 268 (52%) 326 (51%) 201 older Table 1 : Sociodemographic and characteristics IQR interquartile August, 2022wave (odds ratio: 0.36) and there was a trend toward sig- nicance during the Delta wave (odds ratio: 0.5). A simi- lar pattern was observed for people 60 and older. Being 60 or older had a signicant protective effect during theZeta wave (odds ratio: 0.34) and there was a trend toward a signicant protective effect during the Delta wave (odds ratio: 0.25). In addition to these two agegroups, being 5 11 years of age had a signicant protec- tive effect against being a SARS-CoV-2 case during the Zeta wave (odds ratio: 0.34). During the rst wave andthe Gamma waves, none of the age groups had a signi-cantly increased or decreased risk of being a SARS-CoV- 2 case. During the rst wave, the odds of being a SARS- CoV-2 case almost tripled with the number of persons per room in the household. For the subsequent waves, the effect of household clustering decreased log-linearlywith the odds of being a SARS-CoV-2 case. During the Delta wave, there was a trend toward a signicant effect of household clustering. Figure 5 depicts the incidence density of SARS-CoV- 2 infection adjusted by age and epidemic wave. The mean incidence density averaged across age groups dur-ing the rst wave was 52.5 cases per 1000 person-weeks,which was 2.6 times greater than the incidence during the Zeta wave (19.7 per 1000 person-weeks) and 2.2 times that of the incidence during the Gamma wave(23.7 per 1000 person-weeks). The incidence densityduring the Delta wave was 35.6 per 1000 person-weeks. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to assess how differ- ent durations of follow-up influenced the ranking of the waves with respect to incidence. The results indicatedthat the aforementioned patterns - highest incidence during the rst wave followed by the Delta, Gamma and Zeta waves - were robust across different durations offollow-up ( Supplementary Material ). Comparing age groups, the incidence density among children was generally lower than that of older partici-pants throughout the study. For example, during theDelta wave, the incidence density among participants 60 and older was signicantly lower than in younger age groups. Furthermore, during the Delta wave inci-dence among children 5 11 years old was similar to that of working-age adults. Discussion The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and their household contacts in Rio de Janeiro greatly exceeded rates reported in similar cohorts in the Global North. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in our study popu-lation during the rst wave was approximately eight times higher than the incidence reported for family- based cohorts in the US. 1,2Among the factors that may have contributed to the difference in incidence rates isthe geographic scope of recruitment.

On the other hand, few studies have investigated aseverely economically deprived region like our studysite, in which participants were at risk of food insecu- rity, and where violence affects their daily lives. It should be noted that eldwork under these conditionswas only possible because the interviewers were resi- dents of the region hired during our cohort studies. 1115 Residents of low-resource communities may have higher exposure to SARS-CoV-2 than residents of high- resource communities because of household crowding and lower capacity to adhere to shelter-in-place ordersdue to food insecurity. 19Furthermore, due to COVID- 19 denialism by prominent elected ofcials, there was contradictory messaging about NPIs and immuniza- tion, which further complicated compliance withCOVID-19 control policies. With respect to other studies in developing countries, the incidence density in our cohort was similar to rates reported for healthcare work-ers in India and Ethiopia. 20,21These frontline workers likely had higher exposure to SARS-CoV-2 than our cohort, which would have tended to increase incidence. In our cohort, the increase in the relative risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the rst wave and Delta periods was two to three times that of the Zeta andGamma periods. We can conjecture that relative riskwas highest during the rst wave because the popula- tion was completely non-adapted to the novel virus. The association between exposure to the Delta variant andhigher relative transmission compared to other VOCsobserved in our cohort is supported by experimental studies. 22The risk may have been higher during the Delta period because mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor-binding domain associated withthe VOC Delta may have increased the transmissibilityof the virus relative to previous lineages. The observed reduction in incidence in the elderly during the Delta variant wave, despite the rollback of NPIs, may havebeen attributable to increased vaccine coverage. A num- ber NPIs were announced during this wave but not fully implemented; for instance, bars and restaurants weresupposed to require proof of complete vaccination, but most did not. Masks were also not regularly required in stores and shopping centres. In addition, we found that the risk of infection increased with household density. When we considered the number of persons per room in the household, the risk of being infected almost tripled in the rst wavecompared to the subsequent periods ( Figure 3 ). One possible explanation for this difference is that residents were infected earlier in the epidemic in householdswith particularly high density. Subsequently, in the Zeta, Gamma, and Delta waves, the credible intervals of the variables persons/room overlapped with 1 indicatingthat the variable was neither associated with increased risk of being a SARS-CoV-2 case nor with decreased risk. We evaluated two indicators estimated at the ecologi- cal level: The Stringency Index and vaccination cover- age. The Stringency Index graph depicts how health authorities responded to factors such as SARS-CoV-2incidence in the community. Since there may have been Figure 3. Vaccine coverage by age group in the city of Rio de Janeiro during the study . The dates on the x-axis show the beginning of vaccination in each age group. The grey areas indicate the period of predominance of each Sars-CoV-2 lineage.Articles www.thelancet.com Vol 12 Month August, 2022 7Figure 4. Association between age and the number of persons per room and the risk of being a SARS-CoV-2 case (odds ratios +/- credible intervals) by wave.Articles 8 www.thelancet.com Vol 12 Month August, 2022a delay between a change in incidence and the imple- mentation of health authorities' response, the indexmay not be perfectly synchronized with patterns of inci- dence, as is the case for the Gamma wave. However, the index reflects overall trends in incidence. It is well-estab-lished that compliance with NPIs and vaccination is pro- tective against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies in other municipalities have demonstrated that the StringencyIndex captures the population's response to NPIs at the city scale. 23,24The community we studied is located just 15 min from downtown by public transport and mostresidents commute to other neighbourhoods. Thus, thepattern we observe is very similar to other low-income communities in Rio de Janeiro. According to observa- tional data on vaccination coverage on the scale of thecity of Rio de Janeiro, there was a trend of increasing coverage during the study period. It is plausible to infer that this increase in vaccination was made possiblebecause there was a growing acceptance of vaccination among individuals in the age groups that were eligible to be immunized. We can also reasonably surmise thatwith increasing vaccination coverage at the city scale, there was a decline in the risk that the virus would be introduced into any particular community or house-hold. In our study, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in chil- dren was generally lower than that of older participants, in accordance with a previous study of this population. 15 However, the incidence in children increased later inthe epidemic, underscoring the importance of making vaccines fully available to the young. The pattern ofSARS-CoV-2 incidence by age group observed in this cohort can provide potentially valuable information to inform health policies. The World Health Organizationendorsed the vaccination of children aged 5 11 with the BNT162b2 vaccine in November 2021. 25However, in Brazil, the vaccination of children in this age group con-tinues to be opposed by certain groups in civil society and the government. The immunization of children aged 511 only began in Rio de Janeiro on 17 January 2022, after our study ended. It is reasonable to concludethat the high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in children aged 511 in our cohort during the Delta wave (July to November 2021) was attributable at least in part to thefact that these children were not eligible for vaccination. Our ndings highlight that it is crucial that the Brazil- ian government stand behind the policy of vaccinatingchildren despite political opposition. The main strengths of this study are the longitudinal design, which followed participants prospectively, andthe eligibility criteria, which included participants regardless of symptoms, providing an accurate measure of incidence. These inclusion criteria and active followup could provide an unbiased estimate of incidence inother similar populations in Latin America. Although communities with such high levels of poverty and vio- lence are common in lower-income countries, the inci-dence of SARS-CoV-2 in this setting has seldom been Figure 5. Incidence density by age group in each epidemic wave.Articles www.thelancet.com Vol 12 Month August, 2022 9studied due to the challenges of conducting eldwork in this context. Ours is one of the few studies to character- ize the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in this setting. Amongthe limitations of the study is that households without children were not included. During the nal epidemic wave analysed, the Delta VOC, we identied a proportional increase in incidencedensity in the young. This nding strongly suggests that younger age groups need to be vaccinated, which runs counter to antivaccine messaging by some govern-ment ofcials. As Brazil has a long tradition of mass vaccination campaigns and Brazilians largely trust the public healthcare system, 26reducing SARS-CoV-2 inci- dence appears to be an attainable goal through increased access to vaccines and information campaigns publicizing the benets of vaccinating children.
