Each individual is unique and may respond differently to our medical services, meaning results may vary for each person. All living things are surrounded by fields of energy and emit visible light in extremely small quantities. With Kirlian photography it is possible to capture these emissions. Other technologies capture some of the body's energetic functions. EKGs are an electronic representation of the activity of the heart, for example. EEGs are an electronic representation of the activity of the brain. Ultrasound machines use high frequency sound energy to create images. The physical plane is simply dense energy and we now have devices that can interface with it, such as MRIs and CT scans. What Are Biophoton Fields? The field of light and energy that surrounds the body is called a \"biophoton field.\" Eastern medical traditions have been aware of this phenomenon for thousands of years. This energetic model for health has influenced Tibetan medicine, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and Ayurvedic medicine. In 1974, Dr. Fritz-Albert Popp proved the existence of the biophoton field. He showed that normal living cells give off a regular stream of photons, or quanta of light radiation. In his book Biologie des Lichts (Biology of Light) he demonstrated how living cells pass along biological information through photons, through the language of light. Each of the trillions of cells in the human body go through more than 100,000 biochemical reactions per second, all of which are exactly timed and sequenced with each other. The DNA sequence contracts and expands several billion times every second, emitting a photon of light with each contraction. DNA sends out and receives information on each photon. This all happens with a speed far faster than any computer mankind has devised. Light is fast; it is an efficient carrier of biological information.

So too are the meridians, avenues of electrical energy that flow through the body. In the 1950s, Dr. Reinhold Voll, a German medical doctor, scientifically verified the existence of meridians and acupuncture points which had been used for thousands of years in Chinese medicine. Dr. Voll created an electronic testing device to pass a tiny electrical current through the human body and measure the amount of resistance encountered at the acupuncture points. He found that the acupuncture points exhibit a different resistance to current than nearby tissues. He also realized the diagnostic abilities of this information. For example, he found that patients with lung cancer had abnormal readings on the acupuncture points referred to as lung points. Dr. Voll made it his life's work to identify and document correlations between disease and changes in the electrical resistance of the various acupuncture points. To heal with energy is to heal with the body's own essence. Rather than assaulting the body with chemicals, we can encourage our ability to heal through its own inherent mechanisms. It is the body's natural inclination to set itself right again. \"Each patient carries his own doctor inside him. They come to us not knowing that truth. We are at our best when we give the doctor who resides within each patient a chance to go to work.\" - Albert Schweitzer How Do We Know That Bioenergetic Medicine Is Valid? One of the reasons that the allopathic community has such a hard time accepting the concept of bioenergetic medicine is that its practitioners are often unable to explain how they get their information. The information cannot readily be confirmed by any tests that we have currently available to us. Thus we are left with only the \"proof of the pudding being in the eating\" concept. If the treatment works and the person is healed, then the treatment must have been valid. And if the treatment doesn't work, then maybe it didn't do anything, or maybe the person being treated was resistant to the treatment, or maybe the practitioner was a charlatan. So how does one choose a correct response? How do we distinguish among the multitude of bioenergetic treatments and machines which are available all over the Internet and used by both licensed and unlicensed practitioners? My own preference is to use devices which are not operator-dependent. If I am having a bad day, I don't want the bioenergetic scans to be affected by my energies. And once I have picked a device, I check the information it gives me against other devices, or my own logical brain, or the patient's laboratory tests - whatever I need to do, in order to get information from more than one source. If all sources are in agreement, then I consider the information to be valid. If there is disagreement, then the information needs to be double-checked. Homeopathic Medicine What is Homeopathic Medicine? The goal of homeopathic medicine is the cure of chronic illness and restoration of health on an energetic level. This is fundamentally different from the goal of allopathic medicine, which is the management of chronic disease and suppression of symptoms.* How Did Homeopathic Medicine Originate? Classical homeopathy was developed by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann in Germany more than 200 years ago, although the discipline was founded on principles which were expressed in Chinese medicine and in the ancient world more than 2,000 years ago. In Dr. Hahnemann's day, very powerful toxic substances were being used as medicines. Conventional medicine has a long history of it. Mercury was injected as a cure for syphilis, for example. Other fashionable treatments included: - Purgatives - Bleeding - Blistering plasters that were more harmful than effective Dr. Hahnemann stopped using these treatments, because he felt that the effect of the medicine was worse than the effect of the disease. He believed that approaches to disease must be studied from the viewpoint of vitality, meaning the life and health of an individual, and not from the viewpoint of suppression of symptoms. Advanced Homeopathic Medicine From the perspective of advanced homeopathic medicine, all disease or dysfunction is an external manifestation of an internal bioenergetic disorder unique to the individual. Homeopathic medicine looks for that substance which will work on an energetic level to correct the energetic defects or dysfunctions unique to a given individual. In 2010, Professor Luc Montagnier, the French virologist who won the Nobel Prize in 2008 for discovering the AIDS virus, shook up the mainstream medical community with his announcement that he had verified the science behind homeopathic remedies. Speaking to 60 Nobel prize winners and some 700 other skeptical scientists at the Lindau Nobel laureate meeting in Germany, Montagnier explained he had discovered water has a memory that continues even after many dilutions. He said solutions containing the DNA of pathogenic bacteria and viruses, including HIV, \"could emit low frequency radio waves\" and influence water molecules around them, turning them into organized structures that in turn emit waves. Montagnier said water could retain such properties even after the original solutions were diluted to the point the original DNA had effectively vanished. In this way, he suggested, water could retain the \"memory\" of substances with which it had been in contact and doctors could use the emissions to detect disease.[1] A few months later, Montagnier told Science magazine, \"The high dilutions [used in homeopathy] are right. High dilutions of something are not nothing. They are water structures which mimic the original molecules ... DNA produces structural changes in water, which persist at very high dilutions, and which lead to resonant electromagnetic signals that we can measure. Not all DNA produces signals that we can detect with our device. The high-intensity signals come from bacterial and viral DNA.\"[2] Many skeptics fail to recognize that homeopathic remedies attribute their effects not to molecules present in the water, but to modifications of the water's structure. As technology has advanced, we have learned how to measure energetic dysfunctions and departures from the original template. We are now able to treat with substances which can restore the disharmony of the information systems which subtend the body's cellular function, right down to the level of the DNA. This may include: - Electromagnetic energy - Homeopathic remedies - Combination remedies And physical remedies such as: - Vitamins - Minerals - Amino acids - Fatty acids Homeopathic medicine carries the potential to modify DNA switches which have been turned off or on by toxins presented to the body. This, in part, is why it is said that energy medicine is the future of medicine. Why Is Homeopathic Medicine Not a Standard of Medicine Today? By the year 1900, more than 100 homeopathic hospitals operated in the U.S., along with 22 homeopathic medical schools and more than 1,000 homeopathic pharmacies. Interestingly, many students and practitioners were women, and the homeopathic Boston Female Medical College, founded as a school for midwives in 1848, was the first women's medical college in the world. Mark Twain wrote in Harper's magazine in 1890, \"The introduction of homeopathy forced the old-school doctor to stir around and learn something of a rational nature about his business.\"[3] But the allopaths competed for patients. They established the American Medical Association in 1846, two years after the founding of the American Institute of Homeopathy, the nation's first national medical society. Allopaths were called quacks in the 19th century and even before, because they used quicksilver, what we call mercury, also known as quack silver, as medicine. Homeopaths did not support the use of caustic or poisonous pharmaceuticals; homeopathy was the predominant form of medicine at the start of the 20th century. People living on the frontier relied on homeopathic remedies because doctors were few and far between. As Doctors Paolo Bellavite and Andrea Signorini wrote of that era: \"The rapid initial spread of homeopathy was probably initially due, on the one hand, to the fact that the orthodox medicine of [Hahnemann's] day and age was still extremely backward and lacked truly effective therapeutic remedies, and, on the other to the distinct superiority of homeopathy treating the various epidemics of typhoid fever, cholera, and yellow fever which raged across Europe and America in the 1800s.\"[4] In 1855, the AMA incorporated a code of ethics that included expulsion of physicians who even consulted with homeopaths or other \"un-scientific\" practitioners. Similar events were unfolding in Europe; orthodox physicians in France also banned consultations with homeopaths. Homeopathy was outlawed in Austria.[5] The Flexner Report In 1908 the newly formed American Medical Association's (AMA) Council on Medical Education wrote to Andrew Carnegie to propose a collaboration with the purpose of reforming medical education. The Carnegie Foundation was allied with the Rockefellers, who heavily invested first in oil, then in pharmaceutical companies. It was decided to hire Abraham Flexner to investigate the 155 U. S. and Canadian medical schools. Who is Abraham Flexner? Flexner was a schoolmaster who knew nothing about the field of medicine but he was well-connected; his brother Simon was director of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. Flexner's subsequent findings, not surprisingly, heavily favored the medical schools which supported the use of pharmaceutical medicine and \"science-based\" medicine. Flexner wanted to promote higher status for doctors. He recommended specialization, and recommended that most of the schools for women and blacks be closed, since women showed a \"decreasing inclination\" to enter the profession, and blacks were a potential source of \"infection and contagion.\" In the report, Flexner called chiropractors \"quacks.\" Medical Journals Had Mixed Reactions The Journal of the American Medical Association announced that \"[a]lthough there may be statements of detail which might be criticized in the Foundation's report, generally speaking the statements made are recognized as the truth by those who are in a position to judge.\"[6] It was \"full of errors,\" alleged the Denver Medical Journal; \"a piece of monumental impudence,\" according to the American Medical Compound.[7] Among other failings, the report was produced too fast to for Flexner to visit all the schools. \"You don't need to eat a whole sheep to know it's tainted,\" Flexner later wrote in his autobiography.[8] The New York State Journal of Medicine berated the Carnegie Foundation for attempting to \"dictate the policies ... to wipe out institutions with the stroke of a pen\" and thereby \"threaten the freedom\" of medical schools.\"[9] Despite the clear bias against all forms of medical treatment other than allopathic, the report was widely acclaimed by the allopathic medical community. It sent shock waves through the medical schools of the United States. The historic Flexner Report[10] dictated that medical schools which would be funded and accredited would be those which trained doctors in the extremes of medicine - emergency and surgical, both of which make extensive use of pharmaceutical drugs. In 1905, 160 medical schools were in operation. By 1927, seventeen years after the Flexner Report, the number had dropped to 80. The homeopathic medical schools were disappearing. Medicine in America was shifting from its early emphasis on prevention and health to a model of disease management. Influential forces promoted \"allopathic\" medicine, the suppression of symptoms. And they fought competition fiercely. Doctors of Chiropractic came to find themselves denied coverage and recognition in all federal and state government agencies. They took the fight to the court. The historic 1987 decision[11] found the AMA guilty of an unlawful conspiracy in restraint of trade \"to contain and eliminate the chiropractic profession\" and that the \"AMA had entered into a long history of illegal behavior.\" Since then, chiropractors have largely been able to continue their practice without medical doctor interference. George Vithoulkas, a Greek homeopath who is credited for much of homeopathy's revival since the 1960s in Europe, said: \"The immune systems of the western population, through strong chemical drugs and repeated vaccinations, have broken down ... If conventional medicine were really curing chronic diseases, today we would have a population in the West that was healthy, mentally, emotionally and physically.\"[12] Americans are beginning to demand more than symptom management. More and more, they want to find out what went wrong and how to fix it at the fundamental level. In 1999, the first homeopathic college to open its doors since the Flexner report did so in Phoenix, Arizona: The American Medical College of Homeopathy under the direction of Dr. Todd Rowe. It currently graduates the Doctor of Homeopathy and Homeopathic Medical Assistants. Where Are We Headed? I always envied the doctors in the Star Trek programs, with their hand-held scanning and diagnostic devices, and their ability to do surgery - and visualize what they needed to see - without having to use cumbersome and physically dangerous tools. We could be headed in that direction. If we can conceive the device, I am quite certain that someone will build it. Those photons keep popping in and out of existence, showing us the way to a world of infinite possibilities. And in the meantime, we do our best with what we have available to us. We use those physical tools that are effective, we use pharmaceuticals when we have to, we use nutrition and detoxification to maintain and restore our health, we use supplements to provide that which nutrition does not, and we use the tools of bioenergetic medicine that make sense to us. And we keep our minds open to new tools, new drugs, new treatments - remembering that ballast is good, to keep the ship stable in the water. But ballast is meant to be jettisoned, when the ship needs to move quickly, or the waters become shallow. I read a wonderful little book years ago, talking about how to distinguish true prophets from false. The book's advice: \"You will know them by their fruits.\" If use of the tool results in dangerous consequences to the patient, we are well advised to find a different tool. If use of the tool results in accurate assessments or good treatments, then we can use it in good conscience, and with the sure and certain knowledge that something better will come down the pike next year.
