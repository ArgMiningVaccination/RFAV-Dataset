Israel was one of the first countries to widely use the Comirnaty vaccine. Aim We aimed to assess the vaccine's short-term side effects directly from a large population and to predict influencing factors for self-reporting side effects. Methods In a retrospective cohort study, we investigated self-reported systemic vaccine side-effects using electronic surveys sent to vaccinated individuals between 20 December 2020 and 11 March 2021, within 3 days following administration of the first and second dose. We determined predictors for reporting systemic side effects by logistic regression.
