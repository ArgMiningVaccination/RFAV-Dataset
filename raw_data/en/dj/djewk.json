Published by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts www.uscourts.gov Publishing Information Volume 69 Number 1 Home Bridging the Gap Between Theory And Practice\u2014 A Call to Action References Kimberly Gentry Sperber, Talbert House Martha Henderson-Hurley, Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections Dena Hanley, University of Akron Guidelines for Academics Guidelines for Practitioners Conclusions RECENTLY, GENDREAU , French, and Gionet (2004) lamented the state of correctional treatment, stating that the majority of treatment programs examined to date have been \"sadly lacking in therapeutic integrity\" (p.28). They are not alone in this criticism. Latessa, Cullen, andGendreau (2002) have even gone so far as to accuse many treatment programs of practicing\"correctional quackery.\" That so many correctional treatment programs are still in this state afteryears of research into \"what works\" baffles many researchers. Clearly, there is a gap betweencorrectional research and correctional practice. Why this disconnect between research and practice continues to exist is a topic for debate. Much of the discussion in this area, however, has focused on what academics believe to be theresponsibilities of treatment practitioners and administrators in moving programs toward betteralignment with the \"what works\" findings. While there has been some modest acknowledgementthat academics could do more to assist practitioners with implementing and maintainingevidence-based practices, recommendations directed at researchers seem to be aimed at simplydoing more of what they have traditionally done\u2014evaluate programs to better explicate thedifferences between programs that work and programs that do not work (e.g., Cohn, 2002;Latessa et al., 2002). There has been little (if any) exploration into what practitioners need fromthe academic community in order to operationalize evidence-based practices, yet the field willnot continue to advance until researchers and practitioners form an alliance that fosters mutualgoals, mutual accountability, and mutual respect. To that end, this paper challenges academics and practitioners alike to step out of their comforzones and to honestly assess their roles and responsibilities for moving the field forward.This means that some academics will need to move from passive critic to active collaborator,while some practitioners will need to take responsibility for knowing \"what works\" and fordedicating existing resources to ensuring the delivery of evidence-based practices. To furtherexplore the realities of collaboration, the authors draw on their collective experiences as bothacademics and practitioners to provide guidance to academics and practitioners alike. We beginwith the responsibilities of academics. back to topGuidelines for Academics Academics are called to do more to help bridge the gap between research and practice. To bridge this gap, academics must be able to think beyond traditional research methodology. In thetraditional research practice, the academic comes into the agency and decides the researchdesign, analysis, and impact. However, a more effective approach calls for the collaboration ofresearchers and practitioners to decide these issues together. Strengthening Partnerships with ProgramsAcademics often charge that practitioners do not understand the research process and struggle to interpret research findings; yet, researchers have done little to help improve practitioner abilities.Similarly, academics often lack a foundational understanding of program operations and theimplications for research projects. One suggestion for improving understanding on both sides isto approach collaborations as true partnerships. One way of strengthening partnerships withprograms is to include program staff in the development of the evaluation plan. There are severaladvantages to this approach. First, this inclusion gives program staff the opportunity to educatethe researchers about the program, including subtle nuances that might be important but noteasily understood if the researchers simply rely on a general overview of the program. Forexample, most programs claim to use a cognitive-behavioral approach, yet these approachesoften differ in fundamental ways. A second advantage is that program staff can help inform theresearchers about the resources needed to collect the desired data and can help work out thelogistics associated with data collection. Finally, allowing program staff to have input into theway the data will be collected helps to increase their understanding and buy-in, which may resultin a smoother evaluation process. Another way to strengthen partnerships with practitioners is to understand that practitioners do not view a program evaluation as merely an academic endeavor into applied research later to betranslated into another line on a vita. Engaging in an evaluation needs to be a meaningful andpractical experience. This means that the process and the results of the evaluation have to beuseful to the program. Researchers can help achieve this goal by ensuring that implications fromthe study are operationalized into concrete suggestions for improvement. For example,instructing an adolescent girls' program to \"make sure the program celebrates women's andgirls' ways of being in the world\" is neither concrete nor helpful to a program attempting toenhance its implementation of evidence-based practices. Providing Basic Research GuidelinesA second way that academics can help practitioners is to provide them with some basic research guidelines. In order for practitioners to participate directly in the research process, which isnecessary for advancing evidence-based practices, practitioners must have a working knowledgeof research methods and evaluation (Buysse, Sparkman, and Wesley, 2003). Academics can helpby providing comprehensive research guidelines written in a manner that is understandable tothose providing direct services within corrections. These guidelines should provide guidance onquantitative as well as qualitative methodology. At a minimum, any research guidelinesdeveloped for practitioners should include three sections. The first section should provide a \"how-to\" guide on accessing relevant research literature. Practitioners tend to rely on trade magazines and newsletters for programmatic updates. Suchsources are often limited in depth and breadth. A consequence of this is that practitioners whowant to know more often do not know where to look to find the best research literature, nor arethey versed in how to evaluate basic research designs. The second section should provide coverage on how to evaluate quantitative research without being a statistician. This section should cover the basic logic of quantitative researchmethodology in laymen terms. At a minimum this would include: 1) basic coverage on howvalidation studies operate and why they are important; 2) a discussion of reliability and validityand why they are important to practitioners; 3) a basic discussion of statistical significance; and4) coverage of the evaluation study process. Section three should discuss qualitative research methodology. Qualitative research often provides the context for quantitative research and reveals nuances that numeric data simplycannot. This section should describe basic qualitative research methodology. The focus of thissection is on the techniques used in qualitative research, such as how to identify stakeholders andhow to conduct focus groups for qualitative research. The section should also includeinformation on how to evaluate qualitative research findings. With these types of guidelines,practitioners could be more competent consumers of research studies and their findings. This isassuming that they have simple access to such findings, however. Dissemination of Research and EvaluationA third way that academics can strengthen partnerships with practitioners is to assess the utility of current methods for information dissemination to practitioners. Academics tend to viewpublication in tier-one peer-reviewed journals as the primary goal of research. A consequence ofthis mentality is that often what drives research in corrections is not whether changes in practiceare necessary for improvement but rather what research is publishable in a top journal.Academics must begin to view changes or improvements in practice as a primary goal ofresearch, with publication as one step toward that goal (Walshe and Rundall, 2001). The push for publication primarily in tier-one peer-reviewed journals and textbooks by academics also means that few practitioners are likely to have access to research findings. Walsheand Rundall (2001) discuss two primary modes of access to research findings: the \"pull\"method\" and the \"push\" method. The \"pull\" method, most often used by academics, is reactive.Researchers wait until a clinician contacts them seeking information or assume that simplyproviding access through libraries, journals, and databases will be enough for their message toget out. Given agency budgetary constraints, the \"pull\" method is likely to be unsuccessful indisseminating information. In contrast, the \"push\" method is a proactive process wherebyresearchers directly deliver research findings to practitioners. Examples of \"push\" methodsinclude sending copies of research reports directly to agencies, providing training withinagencies, or attending practitioner conferences and presenting research findings. An examinationof who attends practitioner-oriented conferences would most likely reveal that only a smallnumber of academics attend and present on current research and practice topics. Thus, animportant opportunity to improve programming in corrections is missed by most researchers. back to top Guidelines for Practitioners There is a clear continuum of quality (or lack thereof) in correctional treatment programs. On one end of the continuum are those programs that clearly are effective at reducing recidivism\u2014those programs comprising the evidence for \"what works\"\u2014and on the other end of thecontinuum are those programs that are clearly not effective and that willfully reject the \"whatworks\" literature\u2014the correctional \"quacks.\" It is to those programs in between the two extremesthat this paper is directed, for the authors are in agreement with Cohn (2004) and his assertionthat many program administrators do see research as valuable; they are simply challenged withunderstanding and using it. This should not be a surprise, as this is typically not within theirrealm of expertise. Role of Research and Evaluation within Programs and AgenciesPractitioners often view research language as foreign or at least difficult to understand. Equating steps in research methodology to similar steps in clinical practice could help to demystify theresearch process for staff (Raines, 2004). For example, practitioners are often quick to identifyproblems with a client's functioning by assessing the client's status and then comparing this tothe client's baseline data. This process is similar to the development of a problem statement for aresearch project (Raines, 2004). The comparison of these two processes places research methodology, at least partially, in terms that are understandable to practitioners. Even more familiar to most clinical staff is the idea of treatment planning and selection of appropriate interventions. A client's intervention plan can be compared to the quantitative orqualitative design of a research project. While a treatment plan outlines goals, objectives, andmethods to be used for a specific client to achieve a desired outcome, research methodologyoutlines the goals, objectives, and methods to be used for a research project to achieve a desiredoutcome (Raines, 2004). Similarly, just as a treatment plan calls for specific interventions with aclient (e.g., group counseling), so does an evaluation plan. The \"intervention\" phase of a researchplan simply equates to the data collection activities involved in the evaluation (Raines, 2004).Finally, practitioners must evaluate and document whether the interventions that have been usedwith a client have been effective; this is done by assessing whether the client has shownprogress on his or her treatment goals and is documented in the client's chart. Evaluators, on theother hand, demonstrate effectiveness through data analysis and document such in researchreports or journal articles (Raines, 2004). Continual exploration by practitioners into the overlapbetween the role of a practitioner and the role of an evaluator can help to consistently chip awayat barriers to understanding research. Role of Continuous Quality ImprovementWhile many agencies are not able to conduct regular evaluations of their programs, they can monitor the quality of their programs (Latessa et al., 2002). This is especially important in lightof Lowenkamp and Latessa's (2002) finding that programs that monitor quality tend to havelower recidivism rates. Through utilization of continuous quality improvement (CQI) principlesand strategies, programs can systematically use data to assess processes and treatment outcomes(Mabry, Sperber, and Atkins, 2003). To do this, however, program staff must first have anunderstanding of how CQI differs from traditional quality assurance (QA). Many program staff are familiar with traditional quality assurance activities. QA approaches tend to be retrospective and merely emphasize compliance with standards and regulations (JCAHO,1994). Often these standards are not directly related to the efficacy of programming, especially interms of reducing recidivism. In the field of corrections in particular, standards and regulationsare most often centered on facility sanitation and security. Programs are rarely audited for theiradherence to evidence-based practices and the extent to which they address the criminogenicneeds of their clients. CQI, on the other hand, is a prospective process that emphasizes the systematic collection and use of data aimed at continually improving program processes and client outcomes (Mabry et al.,2003). While this sounds conceptually straightforward, correctional agencies often have littleexperience operationalizing a strong CQI program. First, CQI represents a cultural shift for manycorrectional agencies. Second, agency staff often do not know where to begin when searching forappropriate measures of program or client performance. Finally, program staff often do not knowhow to use the data once they have gathered it. Creating a Learning Culture. As previously mentioned, many correctional agencies are used to operating under a traditional QA approach. Because the focus is primarily on compliance, agencies often end up engaging in hide and seek behaviors to avoid putting problems out in theopen. Under a CQI culture, staff are expected to identify problems and to share that informationwith all necessary parties. This requires a safe environment with no fear of punishment fromadministration. In order to create an environment where all staff feel safe disclosing problems, some minimum requirements need to be met. The most basic requirement is that the board of trustees and theadministration fully support this process. This support then needs to be communicated to the linestaff. The focus on quality and continual learning has to infuse all levels of the organization(Mabry et al., 2003). Choosing Appropriate Measures. When choosing measures of program or client performance, the agency should identify both process measures and outcome measures. Examples of process measures include such indicators as the number of case management contacts with clients, length of stay, and number of substance abuse groups attended. Examples of outcome indicators includesuch measures as changes in antisocial thinking, risk to re-offend, employment, and recidivism. Tracking outcome indicators often involves the use of pre- and post-tests with clients. Practitioners typically have little training in choosing these instruments, however. Consequently,there are at least three criteria that should be met when choosing an instrument (Mabry et al.,2003). The first criterion is that staff should not create their own scales. They should instead seekout existing tools that have already been shown to be reliable and valid. The second criterion isthat staff should seek out low-cost or no-cost instruments, given the limited resources agencieshave to dedicate to data collection. The third criterion is that staff should attempt to locate short,self-report instruments. Again, this should help minimize the costs involved by limiting staff timeinvolved in data collection efforts. While these guidelines represent a good start for practitioners, we must acknowledge that they often lack the expertise to select instruments that best fit their services as well as their budgets(Mabry et al., 2003). One potential solution for this is to develop a resource manual for staff thatexplores various assessment tools. The manual should include a list of available instruments withcorresponding reliability and validity data as well as cost data. The manual could also include adirectory of online resources for assessment instruments and full-text research articles. Using Data for Action Planning. With knowledge comes responsibility. This means that agencies should not collect data if they are not prepared to act upon the findings. Under a CQI model, programs are required to create a plan of corrective action (or an action plan) when theyare not performing at the expected thresholds on certain measures (JCAHO, 1994). While thephrase \"action plan\" may be new for correctional staff, the task of creating action plans is not.To illustrate, action planning is simply a process for aligning goals with actions to achievespecified results. There are several examples of documents in agencies that meet this definition;these include client service plans, staff development plans, and agency strategic plans. Regardless of the type of action plan to be created, the plan should meet five criteria. First, staff need to describe the actions to be taken in concrete terms. Second, they need to choose actionsteps that are feasible within the program structure and resources. Third, they need to establish adeadline for completion of the action plan. Fourth, the action steps need to be measurable. Thereneeds to be a clear, objective method for determining whether the action steps were in factaccomplished. Finally, the staff with the most knowledge about the problem should be the onesguiding the action plan rather than choosing people based solely on title or role (e.g., theprogram manager). The result of this is an approach that empowers line staff to engage inproblem-solving in a way that uses data to inform operational decision-making (Mabry et al.,2003). Role of Staff SupervisionThe role of staff supervision is often neglected in discussions of monitoring adherence to the principles of effective interventions. To illustrate, the first response to challenges inimplementation of a new or enhanced practice is to hire an external consultant (often anacademic) to come in and train the staff. If implementation continues to falter, agencies willoften opt for more training rather than examine whether the staff are being supervisedappropriately. Given Sexton's (2003) finding that staff competence is directly correlated withreductions in recidivism, correctional agencies have a responsibility to ensure the competence oftheir staff. This can be accomplished through use of a systematic approach to supervision. When discussing the appropriate structure for staff supervision, the first issue to be addressed is to whom the supervision is directed. It is our experience that conversations about staffsupervision often center on clinical staff only rather than on all direct ser vice staff. This not onlyignores a large sector of the staff\u2014primarily security staff\u2014it also demonstrates limitedunderstanding of applying evidence-based practices. These practices are not only relevant to thegroup and individual sessions conducted by the clinical staff; they are also relevant to general milieu management. The reality is that non-clinical staff spend significantly more time with clients than do the clinical staff. If the treatment approach does not infiltrate the milieu, theprogram has not fully implemented the treatment approach. It is for this reason that anydiscussions of staff supervision need to incorporate all direct service staff. The second issue to be addressed is the type of data to be used in assessing staff competence. Staff evaluations have traditionally relied heavily on whether staff have completed the necessarytasks of their jobs. Examples of these tasks include documentation, head counts, monitoringmedications, and checking facility safety. It is less common to assess staff on their ability toeffectively utilize evidence-based techniques or practices. Examples of such behavioral skillsmight include treating clients with respect, avoiding power struggles with clients or other staff,modeling pro-social behavior, and helping clients to identify thinking errors and appropriatereplacements. The third issue to be addressed is the use of the evaluation data. For example, a common practice across agencies is to formally evaluate staff only on an annual basis. In between theseformal evaluations, they may or may not receive feedback on their skills. A better approach is tocontinuously collect data on staff performance that can then be used in two ways. First, the datacan be shared with individual staff members during formal supervision meetings to highlighttheir strengths and weaknesses. Staff who are not performing to expectations can then collaboratewith their supervisors to create a staff development plan on how to improve. Once this plan hasbeen implemented, data can be collected again to assess for improvement. If done within aculture of learning, this can be empowering for staff. Second, the data can be examined at theaggregate level to assess trends in skill strengths and deficiencies. The data can then be used toinform decisions about further training (rather than relying on training as a reflex). back to top Conclusions Criticism from researchers aside, many correctional programs now exist in a political and fiscal environment that requires that programs demonstrate effectiveness to sustain their funding. Thisis creating challenges for program administrators who have limited fiscal and human resourcesto gather and interpret this proof. While this paradigm shift is often attributed to\u2014or sometimesblamed on \u2014the \"what works\" literature, it is this same literature that can help programs tosurvive the change and to improve the lives of their clients as well. This is only true, however, tothe extent that academics and practitioners can come together in a mutually respectful andaccountable partnership. Many practitioners have an open mind regarding research, but they also require assistance. Academics must respond to these needs by assisting staff in understanding methodologies,selecting reliable and valid tools, and supporting the implementation of results even after thefinal report is written. Similarly, program administrators must assist in the implementation ofevidence-based practice by not only using words such as \"evidence-based\" and \"research,\" butby incorporating these efforts into the culture of the programs. This includes research andevaluation, CQI, and effective staff supervision. The bottom line is that practitioners andresearchers need to adopt a shared vision where both parties are responsible for expanding theknowledge base of \"what works\" and for transforming the field into one of evidence-basedpractice. It is time for action. back to top References The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.

This has undoubtedly been spurred by the growing number of prisoners being released and the high rate of recidivism reported by criminal justiceofficials. It is estimated that more than 630,000 men and women will be released from federaland state prisons in 2004, more than double the number leaving correctional facilities in 1988(Office of Justice Programs, 2004). Research has shown that roughly two-thirds of formerprisoners will re-offend within three years of their release, creating public safety problems intheir communities, disrupting the lives of their fragile families, and imposing a tax burden upontheir fellow citizens (Langan and Levin, 2002). As a consequence of this growing problem,criminal justice policy makers are seeking to identify correctional and post-release practices thatminimize the likelihood of re-arrest and a return to prison. Many interrelated factors affect recidivism rates including, but not limited to, employment, housing, substance abuse, family support, health and mental heath problems, and peer pressure.Given that these factors are inextricably intertwined, most prisoners returning to theircommunities are faced with complex and enormous challenges. This article will examine whatmay be one of their biggest challenges: securing and maintaining employment with a livingwage. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that 33 percent of inmates in State prisons in June1991 were not employed during the month before their arrest (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1993).The unemployment rate for the general population that year was 6.8 percent (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2002).While the exact relationship between employment and recidivism is complex and not fully understood, there can be no doubt that it is vitally important in the re-entry process. A good job is likely to serve as a deterrent to illegal behavior by limiting opportunities for misconduct and providing social incentives for crime-free behavior. Since the vast majority ofprisoners returning to their community need to support themselves and their families, it would beimpossible for them to succeed without securing employment. The importance of steadyemployment is undoubtedly recognized by parole officers. In a survey that asked Missouri paroleofficers to identify the most important aspect of programs for improving parolees' chances forsuccess, the activity most frequently cited (34 percent of respondents) was keeping the offenderin steady or stable employment (Seiter, 2002). Further evidence of the value of employment in the reentry process can be found in recent statistics gathered by the U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services System. In 2003, unemployedoffenders under their supervision were revoked at a rate that was more than 500 percent higherthan that for those who were employed (Burris et al., 2004). Eighty percent of the offenders whowere revoked that year were unemployed. This article will review and analyze the methods that are currently being used by parole agencies to assist former prisoners in their search for employment. Although many states have abolisheddiscretionary release by parole boards, more than 753,000 men and women were under parolesupervision on December 31, 2002, an increase of 2.8 percent from the prior year (Bureau ofJustice Statistics, 2003). Parole agencies could, therefore, continue to play a critical role in thesupervision of ex-prisoners and, ultimately, the reduction of recidivism rates. To determine thestrategies used by these agencies to maximize the employment rate of parolees, a survey wasmailed to parole agencies throughout the United States. This paper presents the findings of thatsurvey, analyzing the data and making policy recommendations based on the informationcollected. back to top The Challenges Faced by Ex-Prisoners Seeking Employment Most ex-prisoners face enormous barriers in their search for employment. One major obstacle is limited educational achievement. In 1997, roughly 38 percent of State and Federal inmates didnot have a high school or general equivalency diploma, a rate more than twice that found in thegeneral population (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2000). Given the high positive correlationbetween educational achievement and wage earnings, the lack of educational skills can be asevere impediment to successful reentry. While parole officers can and should set educationalobjectives for the persons they supervise, it is far more practical to set these goals duringincarceration and to provide prison-based educational services. There is significant evidence thatprison educational programs can contribute to a reduction in recidivism rates (Steurer, Smith andTracy, 2001; Harer, 1994; Piehl, 1994). A second barrier faced by many ex-prisoners is a poor employment history and the lack of marketable work skills. Breaks in employment caused by incarceration and the stigma associatedwith a criminal record all contribute to the poor work record that is characteristic of many formerprisoners. And while there are many examples of prison-based vocational programs that offermarket-driven training, most are designed to meet the operational needs of correctional facilities,not the long-term employment needs of prisoners. Mental health, substance abuse, and health problems also pose significant barriers for ex- prisoners seeking employment. It is estimated that 283,000 persons with mental illness areincarcerated in our country's jails and prisons (Ditton, 1999). More than 80 percent of Stateprisoners reported past drug use in 1997 and more than half indicated that their offense wascommitted under the influence of alcohol or drugs (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1999). Despitethe prevalence of substance abuse problems in this population, less than 10 percent of Stateprisoners in 1997 reported being treated for drug abuse since admission (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1999). Health care problems are also a significant factor. Compared to the U.S. population, the prisoners have an eight to nine times greater likelihood of having HIV infectionand a nine to ten times greater likelihood of being infected with Hepatitis C (Rand Corporation,2003). In many cases, health and mental health, and substance abuse problems are co-occurring,making treatment and case management a challenging task. Ex-prisoners are furthered hindered by obstacles such as laws prohibiting ex-felons from certain occupations and the prejudice many employers have toward hiring them, the lack of identitydocuments, interview-appropriate clothing and transportation needed to secure work, the shortageof child care assistance, poor or nonexistent family support, and homelessness. They must alsocontend with internal obstacles such as a poor self-concept, negative beliefs and a general lackof knowledge about their own interests and capabilities. Any effort intended to increase the employment rate of parolees must systematically take these internal and external barriers into consideration. Specifically, this requires an assessment ofneeds, the development of an action plan that is reviewed periodically and adjusted accordingly,and referrals to appropriate social service and health care agencies. The complexity of thebarriers faced by most ex-prisoners makes it difficult for them to achieve success in securinglegitimate work without ongoing assistance. Without guidance and support, the search foremployment is likely to be a very frustrating journey with many dead-ends and short-lived jobs.Persons who feel trapped in poor paying jobs with little room for advancement are likely to feelthat they have little to lose by engaging in criminal behavior. back to top The Role of the Parole Officer Given the many obstacles faced by former offenders who are reentering the world of work, there is clearly a need for parole agencies to provide employment-related assistance. Parole officerscan have an enormous positive impact upon the employment rate of the persons they supervise.They can use their assessment and planning skills to help parolees make appropriate careerdecisions and develop a realistic career plan. Because they are familiar with employers who hirepersons with criminal records, they can use this knowledge to provide parolees with practicalguidance in their search for employment. They can also provide parolees with the guidance theyneed to remain employed. The parole officer can prevent job loss by watching for indicators ofrelapse and providing timely, structured interventions. When necessary, they can require ongoingdrug-testing of those under their supervision, thus encouraging parolees to remain abstinent fromdrugs and increasing the comfort level of employers who hire them. Conversely, parole officers can have a negative impact upon the employment prospects of the people they supervise. This may happen, for example, if they schedule supervision meetings thatconflict with the parolee's work schedule or if they make site visits that are disruptive to theemployer's business. Additionally, if they are not trained to provide employment-related servicesor do not have access to current labor-market information, their guidance may actually lengthenthe job search process. Even if they are trained and have information resources at their disposal, parole officers typically have large caseloads and multiple responsibilities, limiting their ability to provide employment-related guidance. It would be unreasonable to expect parole officers to serve as job developers, afunction that requires extensive and constant outreach to potential employers, or to serve asworkforce development specialists, a role that requires extensive training and appropriatesupervision. These tasks are better performed by specially designated staff or outside agenciesthrough contracts or letters of agreement. It also makes sense to address some employment issuesprior to an inmate's release to the community. For example, parole officers are frequently calledupon to help persons under supervision acquire the identity documents needed to secureemployment: i.e., birth certificate and social security card. This task should be performed prior torelease, allowing the parole officer to focus on supervision issues and permitting the ex-prisonerto secure employment as quickly as possible. The same case can be made for other workforce development activities, such as job readiness instruction or resume preparation. Ideally, correction and parole officials should work together to ensure that prisoners are ready for employment upon release and that workforce development services are not wastefully duplicated.Parole officials also need to ensure that staff is provided with the training and tools needed toassist ex-prisoners in their search for employment. They must build working relationships withthe one-stop career centers funded by the U.S. Department of Labor. While these centers aremandated to work with job seekers from all walks of life, their capacity to serve former prisonersand their sensitivity to their special needs varies considerably. Parole agencies, therefore, need tobe proactive in building relationships with one-stop center personnel. To that end, it may beuseful for them to explore the Offender Workforce Development Training offered by theNational Institute of Corrections. This training provides three weeks of instruction to teams ofservice providers, bringing together criminal justice and one-stop personnel from regionsthroughout the United States and encouraging the development of strong interagency ties. back to top Strategies Used by Parole Agencies to Increase the Employability of Persons under their Supervision To determine and evaluate the strategies used by state parole authorities to increase the employment rate of persons under their supervision, a two-page survey with a pre-addressedstamped envelope was mailed to the agency heads of every state parole agency on March 31,2004. A follow-up letter, survey form, and return envelope were mailed to non-respondents onMay 10, 2004. The remaining non-respondents were sent e-mails on June 29, 2004 and calledthe following month. Thirty-two parole agencies completed the survey. The survey examined the delivery of employment-related services and determined if this assistance was provided in-house, by referral, or under contract with other agencies. It did notdetermine the percentage of parolees who receive these services, because that information wasnot generally available. Therefore, the information gathered shows trends in the method ofservice delivery, rather than the extent to which these services are provided. The survey also determined, where available, the employment rate of persons under supervision and the extent to which these rates are used to measure the performance of their personnel. Inaddition, surveyed agencies were asked to estimate the number of ex-prisoners who did notpossess the documents needed for employment: e.g., social security cards and birth certificates. Table 1 presents the methods of service delivery used by agencies that responded to the survey. Since most agencies rely on multiple methods for service delivery, the percentages may total greater than 100 percent. The table is followed by a description of each service, the role eachplays in meeting the employment needs of ex-prisoners, and a brief analysis of how thesemethods are being used and can be improved upon. back to top Vocational Assessment and Career Guidance A vocational assessment and the development of an individual action plan are the cornerstones of successful job placement and retention efforts. This is especially true for individuals who havenot developed a career plan and have a spotty work record. The vocational assessment processhelps a job seeker understand his or her interests, work values and skills as well as any barriersthat stand in the way of achieving career goals, including housing, substance abuse and healthproblems, and educational deficits. It includes the development of an action plan that will guidethe individual's participation in treatment, educational, and vocational programs and, ultimately,job seeking activities. Ideally, the assessment process should begin in the correctional facility and continue upon release, permitting the ex-prisoner to \"hit the ground running.\" One-stop career centers and community-based employment and training agencies invariably offer this service and most parole agencies rely on outside agencies for vocational assessments. Neither the extent to which theseassessments are included in the parole record, nor the availability of assessments conductedbefore release was examined by the survey. In-as-much-as it is important to conserve resourcesby avoiding duplication of effort, it is essential that assessments conducted in prison be madeavailable to organizations providing employment services outside of prison. These practiceswould promote the efficient use of resources and should be considered by agencies involved inthe reentry process. back to top Job Readiness and Pre-employment Instruction Another important strategy for increasing the employability of persons under supervision is the delivery of instruction that provides the soft skills needed to find and maintain employment. Thisincludes learning how to conduct a job search, problem-solving skills, oral communication skills,personal qualities and work ethics, and interpersonal and teamwork skills. In addition, it is usefuland necessary to provide trainees with information and resources related to employment. As is the case with vocational assessment, job readiness and pre-employment instruction should be initiated before release from prison. This would decrease the amount of time it takes to securework following release, thus reducing any risks associated with periods of unemployment. Whilemany prisons offer this type of instruction, parole agencies apparently see a need for providing itupon release, either directly or through another agency. Forty percent of responding agenciesoffered this instruction to their parolees and 40 percent had contracts with outside agencies forthis service. The need to provide this service may be based on a perceived lack of preparednessdemonstrated by released prisoners and may indicate a lack of confidence in the efficacy ofprison-based vocational programs. back to top Assistance in Securing Documents Needed for Employment As mentioned earlier, parole officers are frequently called upon to help persons under their supervision secure identity documents needed for employment. More than 62 percent ofresponding agencies reported providing this service in-house, making it the employment-relatedservice that is most frequently delivered directly by parole agencies. When asked to estimate thepercentage of parolees who needed these documents, the average percentage reported by 19agencies was 36.53 percent. Six agencies reported that more than 50 percent of the persons undertheir supervision left prison without these documents. On a more positive note, two agenciesreport that less than 1 percent did not have these documents. Given the extent to which paroleagencies directly provide this service, it is clearly a barrier that is recognized as needingattention. Since it may take a considerable period of time and effort to secure these documents,every effort should be made to do so before release. It would not be unreasonable to requirethose men and women seeking parole to obtain these documents as part of the applicationprocess. Failure to have these documents before release delays the job search process and adds anunnecessary barrier to employment. It also places a burden on the parole officer that would bemore efficiently handled by the correctional system. back to top Job Placement Assistance Job placement assistance is a service that connects job seekers to employment opportunities related to their skill level and interests. The service is usually provided by individuals whospecialize in identifying job vacancies and meeting the recruitment needs of employers.Typically, the placement service is offered at no cost to employers and marketed to them as away of identifying suitable job candidates for hard-to-fill jobs. The service may also provide the job seeker with access to current labor market information, job postings, the Internet, fax machines, and telephones, all for the purpose of expediting the job search process. The need for providing these services is generally recognized by parole agencies. More than 40 percent of the respondents indicated that they provided job placement services in-house. Twenty-four percent provided this service via a contract and more than 65 percent indicated that theyprovided it through referral. Only two of the respondents indicated that they did not provide theservice either directly or through referral. back to top Fidelity Bonding The Federal Bonding Program is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor and is intended to alleviate many of the concerns employers have in hiring ex-offenders and other high-riskpersons. The program pro-vides fidelity bonds ranging from $5,000 to $25,000 that protectemployers from work theft or dishonesty. Because most commercial policies do not cover \"at-risk\" persons such as ex-offenders, the Federal Bonding program gives employers insurancecoverage that might not otherwise be available and helps alleviate any concerns they may haveabout hiring ex-offenders. In 34 states and the District of Columbia, the bonds are purchased by government agencies, one- stop career centers, or non-profit agencies and provided to employers at no cost. The surveyresults indicated that this tool is not likely to be employed by parole agencies. Only 6 percentreported that they provided this service directly and 37 percent reported that they did not providethe service at all. In comparison with other services, this tool appears to be underutilized. back to top Work Opportunity Tax Credit The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) provides employers with financial incentives for hiring targeted groups of job seekers, reducing income tax liability by as much as $2,400 forevery qualified new worker. Ex-felons belonging to low-income families qualify for the credit. The WOTC is a powerful tool for securing the attention of employers who are reluctant to hire former prisoners because of concerns of trustworthiness. It can be used as a marketing tool oremployed directly by the job seeker during the hiring process. As with the Federal BondingProgram, the WOTC is not likely to be used directly by parole agencies. Only 12.5 percent ofresponding agencies reported that they marketed the WOTC directly. More than 21 percentreported that this tool was used through contracts with vendors and 59.4 percent reported that itwas used via referral to other agencies. Given its potential value in the job search process, it isadvisable for all parole officers to become familiar with the Work Opportunity Tax Credit'srequirements and benefits. It is also advisable for parole officers to provide information andguidance about the tax credit to the persons under their supervision. back to top Post Placement Guidance and Follow-up Practitioners have long recognized that helping ex-prisoners keep a job can be more challenging than helping them find a job. Providing follow-up guidance, helping offenders deal with crises,and maintaining a network of support are all critical elements of employment retention work.Despite its importance, many parole agencies do not provide this service. While 61 percent ofthe respondents reported providing retention services through referral, 34 percent indicated thatthis service was not offered at all, either directly or via referral to another agency. Thirty-fourper-cent reported providing it directly. back to topTracking the Employment Rates of Parolees Given the importance of work in the reentry process, the rate of employment is a valuable indicator for measuring the effectiveness of post-release services and supervision. Only 21.8percent of responding agencies reported that they tracked the employment rates of persons undertheir supervision. Where they were tracked, employment rates for 2003 ranged from a high of97.5 percent to a low of 45 percent. The absence of a universally accepted definition for offenderemployment rate and the differences between local economies makes it impossible to compareparole agencies at this time. Fewer than 16 percent of the responding agencies reported using the employment rates of persons under supervision to measure the performance of parole officers. One agency indicatedthat they were doing so on a pilot basis, presumably to determine its value. It's surprising that employment rates are not universally tracked by parole agencies. More than 78 percent of the responding agencies had employment as a condition of parole, validating itsimportance in the reentry process. The agencies that do not track employment rates of the personsunder their supervision may lack the data needed to make informed decisions about theeffectiveness of their staff interventions and services. This indicator, when adjusted for localemployment conditions, also gives parole managers an opportunity to measure their performanceagainst agencies in other jurisdictions. The value of tracking the employment rate of persons under criminal justice supervision and using a coordinated approach to the delivery of work-related services is considerable. Using thisapproach, the United States Pretrial Office for the Eastern District of Missouri decreased theunemployment rate of the persons under its supervision by 52 percent over the course of fouryears (Burris et al., 2004). Missouri's Eastern District also reported that by the end of FY 2003,their revocation rate was 28 percent lower than the average for the federal system, despite a 54percent increase in the number of persons under their supervision. back to top Policy Recommendations Given the barriers to employment faced by most persons leaving prison and their pressing need to support themselves financially, criminal justice agencies must carefully consider all avenuesfor improving the employment prospects of the persons they supervise. No single branch of thecriminal justice system can be expected to solve the problem of offender unemployment. This isa problem that must be addressed early in the criminal justice process, beginning in prison andcontinuing long after release. Nor can the criminal justice system be expected to successfullyaddress this issue without the support of partners in the community. The need to use a \"systems\"approach has been recognized by the federal government in their Reentry Partnership Initiative,which is actively promoting collaborations in the planning and implementation process. Based on the survey results, it can be concluded that parole agencies recognize the value of employment-related services and, to varying extents, have engaged community-based resourcesto increase the employment rate of persons under their supervision. However, the large number ofpersons leaving prison without the documents needed to secure employment and their lack ofreadiness for the job market are symptoms of a systemic problem and the failure to usecommunity resources to the fullest extent possible. I offer four policy recommendations intendedto address the unemployment problem in a systematic way. 1. Criminal justice agencies should provide a continuum of employment-related services to offenders from admission into prison through their release into the community. The process of preparing a prisoner for employment upon release should begin early during his or her incarceration with a comprehensive vocational assessment. This assessment would guidethe delivery of employment-related services, providing benchmarks against which progress can be measured. To ensure a continuity of services, the assessment should be made available to theparole officer as well as the staff of community-based agencies providing employment-related services. This would ensure that services are provided according to a plan and reduce the likelihood of duplicated effort. Clearly, some services should be provided before release. These include securing identity documents needed for employment, learning how to conduct a job search, and life skillsinstruction. Persons released into the community must be ready to conduct a job search withindays of their release, not weeks or months later. Parole agencies should focus their efforts uponjob placement and retention. This may involve working closely with a Department of Labor-funded One-Stop Career Center or a community-based agency serving the needs of the hard-to-employ. Special attention should be given to the deployment of strategies that promote theemployment of offenders, including fidelity bonding and the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.Parole officers should be knowledgeable about these strategies and be able to ensure that theyare used whenever necessary. To ensure that services are integrated, policies and procedures related to employment services should be developed jointly by correctional, parole, and community-based agencies. Thevocational assessment, for example, should be approved by all agencies engaged in providingservices and supervision. Prison-based vocational and pre-employment services should bedesigned with input from parole and community-based agencies to ensure that this trainingadequately meets post-release needs. All too often, prisoners are trained for jobs that do not existin the community, making the job search process a very frustrating task. 2. Parole agencies should measure the employment rate of persons under their supervision and report these rates on a quarterly basis. It has often been said that what gets measured gets done. Any efforts intended to improve the employment rate of ex-prisoners must have measurable objectives. At the present time, mostparole agencies do not have a yardstick against which they can measure the effectiveness of theiremployment interventions. Nor do they have any way of comparing the efficacy of their methodswith those of other states. Measuring and reporting employment rates not only provide thisbenchmark, they send an important signal to supervisory and line staff about the importance ofproviding employment-related services where needed. To ensure consistency between reporting agencies, the term \"employment rate\" needs to be defined and common methods for measuring the employment status of parolees need to beadopted. It is recommended that parole agencies use the definitions and systems developed bythe U.S. Department of Labor to measure the efficacy of welfare-to-work programs. Thesedefinitions and systems have been developed and refined over the course of many years andprovide a nationally accepted benchmark for parole agencies to use. The rate should be adjustedaccording to local employment conditions and regularly reported to the public via the Internet orother methods. 3. State agencies should use the employment rates of the persons under their supervision as an indicator for measuring the performance of parole officers. The use of employment rates as a factor for measuring the performance of parole officers sends two powerful messages to line staff. First, it underlines the importance of ensuring that paroleesunder their supervision find and maintain employment. Second, it conveys the expectation thatparole officers will be proactive in matters related to employment. Before employment rates can be used as a factor in performance evaluations, a base-rate for a state-wide or local segment of the parole population needs to be established. For example, if thestate-wide employment rate of parolees is 55 percent, the performance of parole officers will bemeasured against this benchmark. This assumes that caseloads are assigned on a random basis. Ifofficers are designated to work with special populations, e.g., ex-prisoners with mental healthdisorders, a separate benchmark would have to be established.4. A universally accepted definition of recidivism should be adopted by state criminal justice agencies and used to benchmark the effectiveness of their efforts. The executive and legislative branches of government should set goals for the reduction of recidivism and hold agency headsaccountable for achieving those objectives. The ultimate goal of criminal justice agencies is to promote public safety in a way that is just, fair, and efficient. While measuring and increasing the employment rate of ex-prisoners willcontribute to that goal, we know that employment alone does not preclude criminal behavior.There is, therefore, a need for a broader metric and objective. Specifically, we need to measurethe re-arrest and re-imprisonment rates of former prisoners and set goals for reducing recidivism. Holding criminal justice officials accountable for the reduction of recidivism will promote the use of evidence-based strategies described in this paper. It will also discourage the use ofpractices that are counter-productive, such as revocation, when less restrictive and costlysanctions would suffice. back to top Conclusions There is considerable evidence that prisoners are often ill-prepared to obtain employment upon release, frequently lacking the basic identity documents and skills needed to secure work. Paroleagencies generally recognize the challenges faced by ex-prisoners in their search for employmentand offer a wide range of employment-related assistance either directly or through agreementswith other agencies. However, many parole agencies do not track the employment rates ofpersons under their supervision, making it difficult to determine the effectiveness of the measuresthat are being employed. If we are to determine what works best and for whom, common definitions and databases related to employment rates must be developed and used to measure the effectiveness of theinterventions used by parole agencies. Additionally, policy makers must set goals for theemployment rate of those under parole supervision, holding agency staff accountable forachieving these objectives. Related goals should also be set for the other branches of the criminaljustice system. To that end, interagency planning is needed to ensure that the offenders receivethe appropriate employment interventions at the appropriate time. This planning must take intoaccount the rapidly changing nature of employment opportunities in this country, makingadjustments as required. These recommendations will undoubtedly require an investment of resources into pre- and post- release employment strategies. However, they will also give government officials an opportunityto determine the most effective strategies to employ and to reduce duplication where it exists.Ultimately, the reduction in criminal justice and other costs associated with recidivism shouldoffset the investments made. Given the public's desire to reduce the cost of government and seefurther declines in the crime rate, the time has come to make these investments. back to top Acknowledgements The author would like to gratefully acknowledge Dr. Jess Maghan, Director of the Forum for Comparative Correction, for his contributions to the survey design and his review of themanuscript.

Michael Eric Siegel, Ph.D. Senior Training Specialist, Federal Judicial Center WE ARE IN a time of unprecedented change, substantial risks and challenges, and remarkable possibilities. We are in a world marked by fundamental dislocation and uncertainty, and closer to home by an environment of true scarcity, austere budget pictures, multiplying challenges,perhaps offset by technological wonders that court leaders of yesteryear could not even haveimagined. It's time for new mental models and new leadership approaches. We do not come to these transformative concepts easily. In James Clavell's novel, Shogun, a Japanese woman tells herBritish lover, who is perplexed by the strange world of 17th century Japan into which he hasfallen, \"It's all so simple, Anjinsan. Just change your concept of the world.\" Indeed!! When those of you in the federal court system signed up for the job of chief of Probation or Pretrial Services, you probably did not expect to have to deal with the kind of severe budgetarychallenges we face today leading, in some cases, to downsizing and employee layoffs orfurloughs. I doubt you imagined yourself putting together contingency plans for the continuity ofoperations of your court, or supervising building evacuation exercises to prepare for possibleterrorist attacks. You may have looked out on a court system that seemed well organized andfunctioning smoothly in that complement of court units quaintly described by many as the \"courtfamily.\" And you never imagined, in your wildest dreams, how much time and energy youwould spend on resolving difficult personnel issues. Whether we imagined it or not, this is theworld we have. As a very wise person once said, \"The future isn't what it used to be.\" And yet, in tough times, in times of turbulence or what management scholar Peter Vail calls \"permanent whitewater,\" leadership is more important than ever. In their recently publishedbook, The Price of Government: Getting the Results We Need in an Age of Permanent Fiscal Crisis , authors David Osborne and Peter Hutchinson describe Hutchinson's visit to a grade class in Minneapolis. (He was the former superintendent of schools in Minnesota.) Mr. Hutchinsonasked the class the following question: \"Does anyone know what a leader is?\" The teachercalled on a girl in the back of the room who was waving her hand with such ferocity thatHutchinson was afraid it might become detached from her body. She stood straight and tall andsaid, \"A leader is someone who goes out and changes things and makes things better.\" Now I've read many definitions and explanations of leadership, but I have to say this fourth- grader has gotten to the core of great leadership\u2014someone who goes out and makes thingsbetter. But how? How can court managers go out and make things better in these difficult times? First, by maintaining a focus on the big picture, on the \"core\" of what we do. As Collins and Porrasdiscuss in their excellent book, Built to Last , great organizations have core values, a core ideology that remains constant even in a world of continual change. These organizations may change their tactics and even their strategies, but they do not waiver on what they stand for. We work for the greatest justice system in the world, where we embrace what Justice Sandra Day O'Conner calls \"the majesty of the law.\" In her book with that same title, Justice O'Connerstates that, \"What is quite remarkable in my view is that each and every petition for review,whether provided by a sophisticated lawyer in a high-rise or handwritten by a prison inmate orprivate citizen in her home, is reviewed with care by each Justice.\" Or, as an applicant to theFederal Judicial Center's Probation and Pretrial Services Leadership Development Program putit, \"If Proctor and Gamble can brag about a new detergent and McDonald's can celebrate lowcholesterol French fries, can't the U.S. Probation Officer be proud of the Constitution?\" We are part of a strong and independent judiciary, whose essence was perhaps best captured by President Truman when he said, \"Packing the Supreme Court can't be done. I've tried it and itwon't work. When you put a man on the Supreme Court, he ceases to be your friend.\" Insteadhe or she becomes the friend of those in need of protection\u2014against the ravages ofdiscrimination or the denial of the equal protection of the law. I vividly recall an event that took place shortly after 9/11, when we returned to work at the Thurgood Marshall Judiciary Building. It is a rare occurrence for anyone to use the publicaddress system in our building, but on that day Director Mecham took to the airwaves as it wereand what he said has stayed with me ever since, because it spoke to the core values of which Iam speaking now. He said, as accurately as I can remember, \"I know that many of you are upsetand frightened, and perhaps others are frustrated wondering what you can do to help our nation'srecovery from this tragedy. One of the best things we can do is to continue our work on behalfof the 'rule of law' in this country.\" Yes, the rule of law, or as Churchill described it the\"sovereignty of law\" is what the judiciary is all about. Writing recently in the Los Angeles Times , former Senator Gary Hart said, \"For more nations will follow us because of the power of our ideas than the might of all our weapons.\"The nobility of our cause should uplift our spirits, even in tough times. And it should give us the courage to advocate for ourselves, to lobby for the resources necessary to secure this greatenterprise called the judiciary. As Lyndon Johnson once said, \"Nothing convinces likeconviction.\" But it's not enough to have a noble cause when things get really tough and whenwe operate in an environment of waiting for the other shoe to drop, an atmosphere of scarcityand fear. What else can leaders do to go out and make things better? Allow me to suggest some things we can do. First, I suggest that leaders avoid the panic mode. There is nothing more debilitating to employees than seeing their leaders fall victim to a panicmode when dealing with tough issues. Panic spreads quickly and creates an atmosphere oftoxicity, as described by Professor Peter Frost of the University of British Columbia in a finearticle titled, \"Handling Toxic Emotions: New Challenges for Leaders and Their Organizations\"(Organizational Dynamics Volume 33, 2004). In her unforgettable eulogy for the late PresidentRonald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher recalled how Reagan always maintained a sense of calm as aleader, no matter what came at him. After all, he was even calm when he walked into GeorgeWashington Hospital after being almost fatally wounded and said to the doctors about to operate,\"I hope you're all Republicans!\" In the article I alluded to earlier, Professor Frost shares the insights of David Marsing, a senior manager at Intel, who said in an interview: I try, to the greatest extent possible, to maintain a level of calmness in the face offrantic issues. I try to be as objective as possible in discussions, and if I'm in aface-to-face meeting with someone who has a short fuse, I'll sit right next to thatperson to make sure the fuse is never lit. I do that by being calm, even overlycalm. When things get heated, I even change my voice. I will consciously take a deeper breath, or two breaths, in front of everybody to get them to calm down a little bit and talk about the specifics, about solutions. It's also a good idea to avoid the syndrome of \"learned helplessness\" as described by psychologist Martin Seligman. This posture tells us, \"I can't do it, and the forces are stackedagainst me. I cannot provide any help to my staff because I too am paralyzed by fear, and anger,and my own impotence.\" Indeed, Seligman has spawned a whole movement called positive psychology. This approach redirects focus away from an almost singular emphasis on healing mental illnesses andpathologies, and toward psychology's two forgotten missions: making people's lives moreproductive and worthwhile, and actualizing human potential. Seligman's pioneering work has ledto the development of a school called positive organizational behavior or POB, which appliespositively oriented human resource strengths to organizations; these strengths include self-efficacy/confidence, hope, optimism, and resiliency. The totality of these characteristics amountsto positive psychological capital. People respond better to optimists than to pessimists, even when the only optimism possible is a brutal one, like Winston Churchill who told the British people, \"I have nothing to offer you butblood, sweat and tears...but in the end I know we'll prevail.\" In tough times, you can and should reach out to others. Our system has an amazing reservoir of good will, of people willing to help their colleagues. In the words of Oscar Stephenson, a chiefprobation officer in Alabama, \"Anyone in our system can visit any courthouse in the nation witha full measure of confidence that she will be treated with a warm courtesy and an attitude ofhelpfulness and support.\" People are willing to share computer programs, expert knowledge, andeven solutions to problems. In short, I recommend to you the following: don't go it alone!! In a July 1993 article in the Harvard Business Review , authors Robert Kelley and Janet Kaplan sought out an explanation for how the superstars at Bell Laboratories achieved that elevated status. These are the 10 to 15 percent of scientists and engineers who stood out among their co-workers as stars. Managers explained the ascendancy of the stars by their IQ, or theircompetitive spirit, or other innate characteristics. Kelley and Kaplan, on the other hand, foundthe real keys to becoming a superstar included taking initiative and asking for help when needed. In a recent article in the \"Health\" section of The Washington Post , a physician explained how reaching out to others helped him in his personal struggle against prostate cancer. By consulting friends, experts, and colleagues, this doctor learned that he did not have to take the most extremeadvice proposed by one of his own doctors, but could try out less invasive, promising measuresand then if needed go to the extreme. A new study by psychologist Patrick Laughlin and his colleagues at The University of Illinois demonstrates that the approaches and outcomes of cooperating groups are not just better thanthose of the average member of the group, but are also better than the group's best problem-solver acting alone. I guess this research conclusion seems at odds with the famous quip ofPresident John F. Kennedy, who proclaimed to a group of Nobel laureates seated for a meal atThe White House, \"There are almost as many brains assembled here as there were whenJefferson dined alone!\" Don't go it alone. Why? Because the lone problem-solver cannot match the diversity, knowledge, and perspectives of a group. We at the Federal Judicial Center broadcast an FJTNprogram related to the \"Twelve Angry Men,\" noting that the jury in that famous movie reached abetter decision because of its diversity\u2014and because one of the jury members took the time tosurvey perspectives and entertain dissenting voices. The problem-solver who goes it alone loses a considerable advantage\u2014the power of parallel processing. In a cooperating group, specific parts of a decision can be parceled out to membersfor research, while the lone operator must process each piece sequentially. This can be a fatiguing exercise when performed solo, because the decision requires information, analysis, integration, and judgment. Whether it's about the best way to absorb budgetary shortfalls, to implement a new wave of the latest technology, or to coordinate the plethora of decisions and actions around moving into anew building, the leader will benefit from the wisdom of the team. Finally, you must use compassion in turbulent times. You may think there is little you can do, but according to another article in the Harvard Business Review , there actually exists a compassion lab that measures the compassion levels of organizations. According to ProfessorPeter Frost, \"Leaders of people in pain listen. They listen with attention and compassion tosomeone else's pain providing a moment of human connection.\" In the words of an executiveinterviewed by Frost, \"I didn't say much, but I would look them in the eye and do a lot ofnodding.\" You can take small actions that have a big impact. During the 1995 government furlough\u2014when Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich could not agree on a budget for the federal government\u2014theSecretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, wondered out loud what she could doto show compassion to her staff, who would lose pay and benefits during the holiday season. Sheexplained her actions to The Journal of Leadership Studies in 2002: I had to find a way to keep their morale up during a pretty devastating time forthem, and we did lots of different things. Including the fact that we only had halfthe money for their paychecks just before Christmas, we figured out that we didnot have to take all of the deductions out\u2014Medicare and other tax deductions. Asa result, our employees actually got their full checks before Christmas. They wereshocked because all their friends and neighbors were getting $7.00 checks and$20.00 checks. It just took an extra effort for us to do this for our employees. Wealso communicated very clearly with them about what was going on. Even whenwe did not know what was going on, we sent them a letter saying, \"We love you,hang in there.\" I remember my staff saying to me \"We don't have anything to tellthem.\" I said, \"I don't care, just draft me a letter signed by me that says, hang inthere, we're fighting for you.\" In closing, I wish to emphasize, again, my personal recognition that you are leading yourprobation and pretrial services offices in a difficult time, and that there really is no playbook toguide your actions. You will have to have courage, defined by Senator John McCain as \"that raremoment of unity between conscience, fear, and action, when something deep within us strikesthe flint of love, of honor, of duty to make the spark that fires our resolve. Courage is thehighest quality of life attainable by human beings.\" You will have to try and remember thegrandiosity of the judiciary's mission, the need to face adversity squarely and not resort tolearned helplessness, the imperative to reach out to others, and to use your teams to help you. Take up a new form of leadership, more akin to General Matthew Bunker Ridgway than to Douglas MacArthur. According to David Halberstam, writing in Fast Company (September2004): Ridgway was courageous, but he is also instructive to us as a reflection of a newkind of military leader. In retrospect, MacArthur, the man he would soon replaceas commander in the Far East, seems like a leader from another century. He wasalways busily engaged in cultivating his own personal mystique as the great man,the Great MacArthur who was head and shoulders above all other generals. Theidea was that because he was such a great general, those he led were also great andwould now fight well because he was leading them. Ridgway was very different, a leader for the new, modern era. His leadership was more of anegalitarian kind, premised on letting the men fighting under him find something withinthemselves that made them tough and combat ready. The point of his leadership was not thatthey would think that he was a great general\u2014although in time they did\u2014but that they would fight well because they were now more confident about who they were and what their mission was, and confident, too that they were tough and well prepared. And in a stunningly short time,he turned the Eighth Army around and made it a remarkable fighting force, one that couldstalemate the vastly superior number of Chinese.

The 2002 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Atkins v. Virginia , finally outlawed the practice of \"death qualifying\" mentally retarded (MR) offenders, a practice long abandoned by other democracies. And, more recently, in March 2005, the highcourt banned the death penalty for juvenile offenders ( Roper v. Simmons ). While the death penalty is no longer an option within the European Union and it is not practiced in either of ourborder NAFTA neighbors (Mexico and Canada), executing the mentally retarded, the mentallyill, and youth is seen as especially uncharacteristic of civilized societies, especially in light of thecurrent research on the neurophysiology and neuro-psychology of the central nervous system(CNS) and its relationship to the measure of adult-level competency\u2014the very foundations ofculpability. The advent of more advanced neuro-imaging techniques within the past 20 years hasled to a better understanding of brain development, notably in children and youth. Generallyspeaking, hormonal infusion and rapid growth spurts during puberty, coupled with incompletefrontal lobe mylenation (neuronal insulation), creates a likelihood of both increased subcorticalimpulses and insufficient frontal lobe control over these impulses. And while the process offrontal lobe mylenation is usually complete at the time skeletal growth is completed (usually age18 in Western societies) it takes another seven years for sufficient pathways to be etched in theBasal Ganglia (neuronal super highway). This phenomenon accounts for the higher incident ofimpulsive behaviors among youth and adults until age 25. This is the current argument against\"death qualifying\" youth (French & deOca, 2001). The mentally retarded, on the other hand,have diminished cognitive capacity due to birth defects or accidents and brain insults prior to theage of 18. Unlike adolescents, the mentally retarded are not likely to ever correct their status ofdiminished responsibility. This fact has long been recognized, leading to the well-intended butill-fated sterilization laws enacted in much of the U.S. during the 20 th century. Ironically, while clinical disciplines, including psychology, have made significant contributions to the current MR and juvenile offender cases before the high court, they have also contributedhistorically to the now questionable practices of eugenics, a foundation for the most severesocietal sanction\u2014the death penalty for mentally retarded offenders. Interestingly, the U.S.Supreme Court based its death penalty decisions not on international consensus but rather on\"national consensus.\" But once this means test was met, the Court used clinical evidence tosupport its ban on \"death qualifying\" the mentally retarded. The current foundation for the June2002 U.S. Supreme Court decision ( Atkins v. Virginia ) is rooted in the new neurological research available within the past 15 years and represented by current clinical assessment tools, includingthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR). The Atkins decision reads: \"Execution of criminals who were mentally retarded held to constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of Federal Constitution's Eighth Amendment.\" Essentially the Court felt that the execution of the mentally retarded would not measurablycontribute to either deterrence or retribution within the U.S. criminal justice system. The Courtalso noted that mentally retarded defendants face a greater risk of wrongful execution before thejudicial system and therefore warrant special protection. In Atkins, the U.S. Supreme Court notedthat the evolving standards of decency within the country now prohibit the execution of peoplewho are mentally retarded. The scientific basis for this decision cites the standards set forth byboth the American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR) and the American PsychiatricAssociation that MR is basically defined as 1) significant subaverage general intellectualfunctioning, 2) concurrent with deficits in adaptive functioning, and 3) occurring before age 18. Clearly the introduction of clinical elements in the death penalty argument is significant\u2014but not new. Even then, jurisdictions such as Texas continue to defy Atkins by challenging the clinicaldefinition of mental retardation, bringing to the forefront the marked, and often contravening,differences between the legal and mental health disciplines and their respective definitions of thesituation. Contributing to this dilemma concerning a concise measure of mental retardation arethe conflicting definitions offered by two separate organizations: the American Association onMental Retardation (AAMR) and the American Psychiatric Association (APA). In Atkins theU.S. Supreme Court used the 1992 AAMR definition: Mental retardation refers to substantial limitations in present functioning. It ischaracterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, existingconcurrently with related limitations in two or more of the following applicableadaptive skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social skills,community use, self-direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure, andwork. Mental retardation manifests itself before age 18 (Luckasson, 1992:5). The American Psychiatric Association definition that is listed in the DSM-IV-TR offers variableIQ ranges for each of the four categories, while also noting that MR has numerous etiologies(presented on Axis III) and: \"may be seen as a final common pathway of various pathologicalprocesses that affect the functioning of the central nervous system (APA, 2000: 41-49).\" Here,Mild Mental Retardation, one of five codes within the MR classification diagnosis, is listed as anIQ range of 50 to 55 to approximately 70. Accordingly, a seventy IQ reflects two standarddeviations from the normative IQ of 100 or a statistically significant departure from the norm asstated in the Atkins decision. Texas continues to challenge the measurement of the IQ rangerequisite for a diagnosis of mental retardation in its attempt to continue to death qualify offenderswith low-range intelligence. back to top Clinical/Legal History of Assessing Legal Competence The role of psychology in the classification of intelligence, and hence legal competence, goes back to the origin of intelligence measurement itself\u2014the Binet Simon developed in France inthe early 1900s by psychologist Alfred Binet and physician Theodore Simon (Fancher, 1985).However, it was the U.S. version\u2014the Stanford-Binet\u2014that made dramatic claims relevant to itspower to predict deviant and/or criminal behaviors, hence paving the way for legal sanctionsdirected toward those labeled \"subaverage.\" Terman stated in the original 1916 Stanford-Binetthat: It is safe to predict that in the near future intelligence tests will bring tens ofthousands of these high-grade defectives under the surveillance and protection ofsociety. This will ultimately result in curtailing the reproduction of feeble-mindedness and in the elimination of an enormous amount of crime, pauperismand industrial inefficiency.... One of the most important facts brought to light bythe intelligence test is the frequent association of delinquency and mental deficiency.... There is no investigator who denies the fearful role played by mental deficiency in the production of crime, vice and delinquency.... Not all criminalsare feeble-minded, but all feeble-minded are at least potential criminals. That everyfeeble-minded woman is a potential prostitute would hardly be disputed byanyone.... Considering the tremendous cost of vice and crime it is evident thatpsychological testing has found here one of its richest applications (Terman,1916:26). Clearly, Terman was influenced by British psychologist Francis Galton, who was in fact hismentor. Galton, considered the father of scientific psychology and mentor to J.M. Cattell,Spearman, and Terman, played a significant role in setting the stage for the use of psychologicaltests to implement the dictates of Social Darwinism. These ideals were born in Galton's theory ofeugenics (breeding for positive traits). Eugenics, implemented partly through involuntarysterilization, was seen as the means for achieving successful Social Darwinism in the UnitedStates. The purpose was simple\u2014improvement of the human race through the elimination ofwhat were considered to be defective gene pools. It was Terman, however, who provided theseemingly objective measure for determining who was unfit. To Terman, general intelligence testing provided sufficient evidence to evaluate and label serious deviants in society. Included here was the implicit plan for social control, including theelimination of the mentally deficient through institutionalization and sterilization. Indeed, theinfluence of Galton's eugenics coupled with Terman's U.S. version of the Binet was so profoundthat by 1926, 23 states had enacted mental retardation sterilization laws, 18 of those providingfor mandatory sterilization of those classified as being mentally deficient, including habitualcriminals. In 1927, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld involuntary sterilization in Buck v. Bell . A recent study by faculty at Johns Hopkins University compares eugenic sterilization in both theUnited States and Germany from 1930 until 1945. While the numbers of U.S. forcedsterilizations pale in comparison with the 360,000 to 375,000 affected by this practice duringNazi rule (this number not including those exterminated during the Holocaust), some 40,000persons were involuntarily sterilized in America during this period (Sofair & Kaldjian, 2000).Involuntary sterilization ended in the United States, at both the state and federal levels, duringthe Civil Rights era of the 1960s, when it was realized that those most likely to be subjected tothis practice were poor minorities, notably African Americans and Native Americans (French,1994). The race/class and IQ controversy continued into the 1970s and 1980s with the Larry P. v. Riles case. The Larry P. challenge, filed in 1971, was a class-action suit representing African- American children and youth labeled as being EMR (educable mentally retarded) by the SanFrancisco Public Schools and subsequently placed in special education classes. The suit claimedthat flawed IQ assessments resulted in a disproportionate number of minority children beingplaced in \"educable mentally retarded classes.\" The petitioners contended that this processviolates Title IV of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the 1973 Rehabilitation Act, and Public Law 94-142\u2014the 1975 Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EAHCA of 1975). One of thepetitioners, the Bay Area Association of Black Psychologists, sought a ban on IQ testing,especially single measure indicators of general intelligence. The Association argued that existingIQ tests were not adequately standardized to reflect minority subcultures in the United States,hence resulting in these students having a greater likelihood of being placed in stigmatizingspecial education curriculum that, in turn, led to a greater school drop-out rate and a markeddisadvantage in the job market once they left school. French (1986a) noted that the mechanismof testing stigma is tantamount to blaming the victim , a self-fulfilling prophecy whereby minorities, including the mentally retarded, are blamed for their poor test results and thereforebecome labeled as deviant. The Larry P. case worked its way through the California courts and into the federal appeals courts, ending with the Circuit Court of Appeals in 1984. The result was an agreement that no assessment of ability would rest on a single instrument. Equally compelling was the move to better norm subsequent versions of existing instruments as well as to include other measures of mental retardation, such as medical etiologies, life histories and the like in order to rule out class, ethnic, and racial factors (French, 1986a, 1986b, 1986c). Another factor leading to the execution of the mentally retarded was the movement toward deinstitutionalization that began in the 1960s with the advent of new psychotropic medicationsand the movement toward community mental health facilities. Interestingly, thedeinstitutionalization process in the United States was initiated in the prisons ( Baxstrom v. Herald , 1966; Dixon v. Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania , 1971) and only later involved facilities for the mentally retarded ( Wyatt v. Stickney ,1972; Halderman v. Pennhurst , 1979). Two major U.S. Supreme Court cases occurred in the 1980s\u2014 Youngberg v. Romeo , 1982; and City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center , 1985)\u2014setting the stage for the current U.S. Supreme Court decision. Additionally, the Larry P. v. Rile case challenged the reliability and validity of intelligence testing, especially among minorities challenging Terman'sfaith in the ultimate power of IQ tests. Even then the Atkins ruling allows the state to determinehow mentally retarded offenders are to be assessed and measured. Part of this dilemma can betraced to the fact that Larry P. v. Riles was not appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In Baxstrom v. Herold , the high Court held that Baxstrom had been denied equal protection of the law by statutory procedures under which he was held at New York's Dannemora State Hospital for the criminally insane. Deemed mentally ill while serving a criminal sentence,Baxstrom was held beyond the expiration of his maximum sentence. The U.S. Supreme Courtruled that this action and corresponding statutory justification violated Baxstrom's civil rights,notably those guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as those of the entire classthat his case represented. This case was significant in establishing three precedents for the rightsof the incarcerated mentally ill: 1) it terminated the practice of extended institutionalization; 2) itestablished a critical precedent regarding both prisoners' and patients' rights; and 3) it forced theimmediate transfer of nearly a thousand patients from penal to civil facilities (French, 1986d;Steadman & Keveles, 1972). While Baxstrom initiated the decarceration process within forensic facilities, it was the Dixon case ( Dixon v. Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ) that addressed the issue of dangerousness\u2014the single most critical factor used in determining long-term institutionalization, whether in a prison forensic unit, psychiatric ward or state school. Here,Donald Dixon and others filed a class action suit challenging the constitutionality of theirinvoluntary confinement at Pennsylvania's Farview State Hospital. In 1971, the Court ruled forthe plaintiffs, ordering all members of the Dixon class either released outright or reevaluated fortreatment in non-forensic mental health facilities. Similarly, the Dixon case required that sentence-expired mentally ill offenders must be released from penal forensic institutions to civilfacilities or to the community (French, 1986d; Thornberry & Jacory, 1979). The 1971 Wyatt v. Stickney case specifically addressed the rights of involuntarily confined mentally retarded clients. The federal Court in this case ruled for improved standards of institutional operations for the mentally retarded in Alabama. While this case did not call for therelease of the institutionalized class of mentally retarded residents, it did specify the \"quality ofcare\" required for these involuntarily committed individuals, thereby setting the stage foreventual deinstitutionalization of this population. The conditions now required included: 1) ahumane environment; 2) sufficient and qualified staff; 3) individualized treatment plans; and 4)residence in the least restrictive environment (Braddock, 1981). In 1977, in Halderman v. Pennhurst , a federal Court ordered the first closing of a U.S. mental health facility. In its decision, the Court determined that confinement and isolation of retarded residents at the Pennhurst State School constituted segregation. Moreover, the Court cited thestate school for not abiding to the minimal treatment standards set out in Wyatt . The state of Pennsylvania appealed the decision all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, setting the stage forthe 1982 Youngberg decision. Both the Youngberg and Cleburne cases had unintended consequences that unwittingly fueled the mentally retarded death penalty controversy in addition to their manifest intent of improving the lives of the mentally retarded population in the United States. The Youngberg case was significant in that the U.S. Supreme Court based this decision on lower court rulings and in contrast to its 1926 Buck v. Bell decision sanctioning eugenics via sterilization of the mentallyretarded. The Youngberg case addressed the Wyatt 71, 72, 74 standards relevant to the involuntary confinement of the mentally retarded. In Youngberg the U.S. Supreme Court nationalized these standards across the country. Essentially the U.S. Supreme Court looked at the case of Nicholas Romeo, an involuntary resident of Pennhurst State School and Hospital, relevant to his Fourteenth Amendment rights.The Court held that involuntarily committed mentally retarded residents have a constitutionalright to habilitation and training. Indeed, the U.S. Supreme Court explicitly stated thatinvoluntarily committed persons afflicted with mental retardation have the same rights to dueprocess as do prison inmates, including habeas corpus petitions: \"If it is cruel and unusualpunishment to hold convicted criminals in unsafe conditions, it must be unconstitutional toconfine the involuntarily committed\u2014who may not be punished at all\u2014in unsafe conditions\"(Youngberg v. Romeo : 1982). The Youngberg decision states that mentally disabled people cannot be deprived of the following interests that are clearly recognized as constitutionally required for institutional care: 1. Reasonable care and safety. 2. Freedom from bodily restraints. 3. Adequate food, shelter, clothing, and medical care. 4. Those liberty interests to which convicted criminals are entitled. 5. Adequate training or habilitation to ensure the enjoyment of liberty. The Youngberg ruling touched upon a number of critical clinical and legal areas affecting both institutional care (quality of care; habilitation and treatment; aftercare) and community placement(mainstreaming into public group homes). Many states found it too expensive to maintain theirstate schools and psychiatric hospitals under these conditions, resulting in the release ofsignificant numbers of mentally retarded and mentally ill (MI) clients into communities that wereill-prepared for the intensity of their care. Ironically, prisons and jails now became the home ofinadequately treated MR and dual diagnosed MR/MI individuals. The clinical safety net was notadequate at that time and still is deficient in many states, leading to long backlogs of never-treated mentally retarded individuals, making them all the more susceptible to criminaladjudication (French, 1983; 1986d). Community resistance to group homes led to the second major U.S. Supreme Court decision regarding the care of the MR. In the 1985 City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center case, the Court ruled that mental retardation in itself does not determine a quasi-suspect class andtherefore does not warrant special legal rights beyond those afforded all citizens under the EqualProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. By the same token, the Court struck downzoning ordinances that may discriminate against group homes for mentally retarded clients. Thisruling proved to be a mixed blessing for advocates of deinstitutionalization. While the rulingremoved a serious obstacle to strategically located group homes for this population, it also deniedthese mainstreamed clients additional special considerations that may have been available if theywere afforded \"quasi-suspect\" classification, such as is extended to the mentally ill. A majorconsequence of this ruling was the changing of mental retardation from an Axis I major clinicalsyndrome to Axis II, beginning with the 1987 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-III-R)and in all subsequent versions. back to top The DSM and the Criminal Adjudication Process Axis I disorders, with the exception of the v-codes, offer defendants substantial license regarding mitigating circumstances. This is especially critical in the two-phase adjudication processarticulated in the U.S. Supreme Court's reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976, following its1972 Furman v. Georgia ruling on the death sentence as being unconstitutional as administered up to that time ( Gregg v. Georgia ; Jurek v. Texas ; Proffit v. Florida ). The advent of the DSM-III in 1980 greatly aided forensic psychology and psychiatry by providing a scientific multi-axle model of clinical definitions based on the World Health Organization's InternationalClassifications of Diseases (ICD). This provided for a more objective marriage between theclinical and legal disciplines in civil, criminal and juvenile court hearings with the generallyaccepted understanding that Axis I major clinical disorders and/or syndromes could be presentedas mitigating circumstances in order to challenge aggravating circumstances. On the other hand,it was generally held that Axis II disorders were not to be considered significant factors thatcould override aggravating circumstances. At the time of the DSM-III, personality disorderswere the only category in Axis II. But following the U.S. Supreme Court's 1985 Cleburne decision that the mentally retarded did not share the same special protected class as the mentally ill, MR classifications were relegated to Axis II, beginning with the 1987 DSM-III-R. This shift in classification now made mentallyretarded defendants \"death qualified\" even under the two-tier adjudication death qualifyingsystem approved by the U.S. Supreme Court and used from 1976 until the present. It would beinteresting to know how many, if any, MR defendants were spared being \"death qualified\"between 1976 and 1985. At any rate, the resulting separation of the MR class from the samelegal protection held by the mentally ill (MI) class was seen by many as an unfortunateunintended consequence of the Cleburne decision. Nonetheless, the 2002 Atkins ruling set the stage for the next death qualifying legal challenge,that of death qualifying youth offenders. All other civilized nations, including international organizations such as the United Nations and the European Union, were already against theexecution of adolescents. The December 2003 issue of the American Psychologist addressed this issue as well. Laurence Steinberg and Elizabeth Scott, in their article, \"Less Guilty by Reason ofAdolescence: Developmental Immaturity, Diminished Responsibility, and the Juvenile DeathPenalty,\" presented many of the same clinical and neuro-physiological issues that were offered inthe clinical defense against executing the MR\u2014mainly that neither class should be held to thenormal adult standard of mens rea , especially when considering the ultimate sanction\u2014 execution: Under principles of criminal law, culpability is mitigated when the actor'sdecision-making capacity is diminished, when the criminal act was coerced, orwhen the act was out of character. The authors argue that juveniles should not beheld to the same standards of criminal responsibility as adults, because adolescents'decision-making capacity is diminished, they are less able to resist coerciveinfluence, and their character is still undergoing change. The uniqueness ofimmaturity as a mitigating condition argues for a commitment to a legalenvironment under which most youths are dealt with in a separate justice systemand none eligible for capital punishment (Steinberg & Scott, 2003: 1009). The American Psychological Association filed an amicus brief in the Roper v. Simmons case before the U.S. Supreme Court. The brief supported banning the death penalty for youth,presenting recent psychological research that indicates that youth are more impulsive and takemore risks than adults, make more immature decisions, fail to resist peer influence and are moresusceptible to coercion and false confessions: \"The brief includes recent brain-imaging researchon brain functioning that suggests an average brain continues to develop through the teen years,particularly in areas that control decision-making (Gilfoyle, 2005: 46).\" Clearly, as the SupremeCourt ultimately agreed in Roper v. Simmons , the arguments for diminished capacity also apply to the mentally retarded and youth. There is clear scientific evidence that these classes ofindividuals do not have the same mental resources and capacity as adults when it comes to fullcriminal responsibility\u2014the standard which provides the basis for mens rea and hence thejustification for society's ultimate sanction\u2014death. back to top References The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.

Gable, Claremont Graduate University Evaluation of Program Effectiveness Monitoring with Graduated Sanctions Positive Monitoring Conclusion THE SUPERVISED RELEASE of business executive Martha Stewart from Alderson Federal Prison Camp in March, 2005, brought unprecedented attention to the use of electronic monitoring. Ms. Stewart and other CEOs who have been electronically monitored (e.g., DianaBrooks of Sotheby's) are non-violent offenders who appear to present little threat to thecommunity. Electronic monitoring in such cases is not a matter of public safety, nor is suchmonitoring required to facilitate the integration of these offenders into society. Rather, themonitoring serves as a socially expedient intermediate sanction that is more punitive thantraditional probation, but less harsh than incarceration. The punitive aspect of electronic monitoring (EM) is primarily a result of a more rigorously enforced compliance with the conditions of community supervision. Violations can be moreeasily documented with EM than with traditional procedures, and sanctions can then be applied.The intention of the designers of the original prototype system was not, however, to enhancecompliance but to help offenders gain self-esteem and socially valued skills (Gable, 1986). Thepresent paper is a brief critique of current and future uses of EM as a mobile communicationtechnology. In 1964, Ralph Schwitzgebel at Harvard University designed and patented (#3,478,344) with William S. Hurd a prototype electronic monitoring system in Cambridge, Massachusetts(Harvard Law Review ,1966; Schwitzgebel, Schwitzgebel, Pahnke and Hurd, 1964). 1 Juvenile offenders were monitored within prescribed geographical areas where repeater stations werelocated. When an individual's transceiver activated the repeater station, his location wasindicated on a lighted map at the base station. A few years later, Ralph Schwitzgebel's twinbrother (Robert Schwitzgebel), a professor at UCLA and later at Claremont Graduate University,licensed an FCC-experimental radio station that supported a modified prototype system capableof sending tactile signals and of permitting two-way coded communication (Schwitzgebel, 1969;Schwitzgebel & Bird, 1970). 2 Both of these radio-frequency transmitter/receiver systems were relatively expensive and electronically primitive by contemporary standards. As Mainprize(1996:6) noted, \"Schwitzgebel's efforts to promote EM fell upon the shores of economic andtechnical impracticality.\" In 1983, district court judge Jack Love, a former federal public defender, was thinking of a way to keep someone from going to jail and persuaded Michael Goss, a computer salesperson, todevelop a system to monitor five offenders in Albuquerque, New Mexico (Ford & Schmidt, 1985). A second system was implemented by Thomas Moody in Key Largo, Florida. By 1987, 21 states had reportedly begun EM programs, with more than 900 offenders being monitored(Schmidt, 1988). In the following 15 years, the number of persons in the United States supervised outside jail facilities by EM had greatly increased, with estimates ranging from 12,000 to 75,000 (Cohn,2003; Sourcebook, 2005). Roughly estimated, about 20 percent of community-based supervisionin the United States now involves electronic monitoring, and equipment is provided byapproximately 20 private companies. Similarly, in England and Wales, about 20 percent of50,000 offenders who started pre- or post-release supervision in 2004 were electronicallymonitored (National Probation Service, 2005); in Sweden approximately 25 percent of 15,000prisoners were placed on electronic monitoring in 1998 (Hofer, 2000). Two changes are generally credited with the rapid growth of EM in the 1980s. The first change was the expansion of the prisoner population as a result of mandatory minimal prison terms,especially for low-level drug offenses. This led to prison overcrowding and subsequent judicialmandates to limit prison intake. The second change was expansion of a technologicalinfrastructure for information processing. Analog telephone networks were replaced by digitalnetworks; this replacement permitted easier integration with more powerful and lower-costmicroprocessors. In terms of number of units presently deployed, EM can be judged a success.In terms of social benefit, the assessment is less certain. back to top Evaluation of Program Effectiveness The efficacy of EM, as a form of intensive supervision, can be measured in many ways.The most common outcome variables include recidivism, revocations, and recorded infractions. The appropriate use of any of these variables obviously depends on the reason that the offenderoriginally entered the criminal justice system. EM is most commonly used with the followingtypes of offenses (Lilly, Ball, Curry & McMullen, 1993; Connelly, 1999): Drug possession DUI Driving without a license or with a suspended license Assaults and battery involving domestic affairs Petty theft, or theft without injury Welfare or housing fraud Credit card fraud or embezzlement Selection criteria have, in some studies, also limited EM participants to persons with positiveattributes such as strong family support (Roy, 1997) or individuals who are employed or attendschool and can pay an income-based fee for participation (e.g., San Mateo County, 2005). Despite the common assertion that EM is primarily used with offenders who would otherwise be imprisoned, evidence suggests that there has been \"net-widening\" to include low-risk offenderswho would not normally be Wallace-Capretta and Rooney, 1999; Jackson,DeKeijser and Michon, 1995; John Howard Society, 2000). Thus, the low recidivism rate ofsome programs is not a result of the deterrent power of EM, but merely a reflection of the low-risk profile of the participants\u2014a \"Martha Stewart\" effect. Because the risk profiles of offender participants differ, as well as the variables measured and the nature of the supervision accompanying EM, no clear and consistent pattern of benefit hasemerged. For example, a qualitative assessment of a home-confinement program in Floridaconcluded that, despite some technical problems, EM was \"generally successful\" as an alternativeto incarceration (Papy and Nimer, 1991). A study of 126 monitored drug offenders in Los Angeles compared to a matched group of 200 drug offenders who were not monitored showedsignificantly fewer major violations for the monitored group during monitoring as well as 90 days subsequent to monitoring (Glaser and Watts, 1992). A study of a home detention program in Indiana by Roy (1997) reported that about 75 percent of the offenders did not recidivate afterone year. In contrast, Finn and Muirhead-Steves (2002) found no significant difference in the number of rearrests after three years between electronically monitored offenders and a control group. Nosignificant differences were observed in a one-year evaluation by Petersilia and Turner (1992)between probationers in an EM program and probationers in an intensive supervision program.Similarly, a two-year comparison of the reconviction rate of regular probationers in the U.K.with 261 offenders under electronic house arrest found no difference between the two groups(Sugg, Moore and Howard, 2001). A carefully designed one-year follow-up study in Canada that compared 262 male offenders in EM programs with unmonitored inmates and probationers concluded that, after controlling foroffender risk and needs, \"EM does not have a post-program impact on criminal behaviour\"(Bonta, Wallace-Capretta, and Rooney, 1999:25). A comprehensive meta-analysis of 381 articlesand abstracts on the effectiveness of EM with moderate to high-risk offenders has been publishedby Renzema and Mayo-Wilson (2005). They found no convincing evidence that EM is moreeffective in reducing the rate of offending than other prison diversion programs. These reviewersconcluded that: It is hardly surprising that recidivism has not been reliably reduced by anintervention that is typically quite short, applied in a standard fashion, and appliedto a diverse group of offenders for whom it may or may not have any relevance totheir motives for offending. Extant EM programs seem akin to giving aspirin to amixed group of hospital patients and then wondering why their underlying diseaseshave not been cured. (Renzema & Mayo-Wilson, 2005:[in press]) back to top Monitoring with Graduated Sanctions Electronic monitoring would appear, at least initially, to be a technology well suited for correctional interventions that apply sanctions of gradually increasing severity. Such graduatedsanctions are typically administered as a structured, incremental response to non-compliantbehavior of a parolee or probationer. As an integral part of this strategy, a comprehensiveclassification system was developed for assessing the probability of re-offending by adjudicatedyouth (Wilson and Howell, 1993). The classification system is accompanied by a conceptualmatrix that guides agencies in making disposition decisions. Suggested sanctions include briefwork assignments, daily attendance at self-help groups, curfew restrictions, more frequent drugtesting, short jail stays, as well as home confinement with monitoring. The sanctions are aversive events intended to punish and eliminate unwanted behavior. Behavioral scientists have carefully studied the effects of punishment for more than 35 years(e.g., Skinner, 1969), and the basic principles are firmly established. Laboratory experimentshave demonstrated that the most effective aversive stimuli are certain, severe, and immediatelyrelated to the unwanted behavior. Community EM programs that are designed to maximize thespecific deterrent effects of punishment generally attempt to follow these principles. However,two practical and persistent difficulties limit effectiveness: 1) Technical constraints. Technical problems with EM are inevitable, particularly in a commercial market where equipment suppliers try to get a competitive edge by equipmentinnovations. A possible violation in the form of an \"alert\" or \"exception event\" can be triggeredby equipment malfunctions such as a telephone's advanced calling features being activated by afamily member, failure of a field monitoring unit to pick up a transmitter signal, or a computercrash. Other system glitches can occur when a backlog develops in the process of verifyingexception events by the monitoring center, or when a staff member fails to enter into the computer an approved change in an offender's schedule. Receivers are sometimes placed in a residence in order to warn a potential crime victim (who is typically involved in a domestic violence situation) that an offender has come within a definedand prohibited geographical radius. Such false alarms are troublesome for potential victims aswell as police and offenders. Erez and Ibarra (2004:18) noted that false alarms in an EMprogram initially caused unnecessary fear among potential victims. Later, when the alarms\"became routine,\" irritation was expressed. 2) Judgments made by program staff. Even if EM technology were infallible, immediate and unequivocal sanctions could not be reasonably applied. Consider, for example, the very common situation of a parolee associating with ex-convicts. Will an immediate sanction actually beadministered? Or, if an offender fails to show up for an appointment, will a severe sanction beautomatically applied? Probably not, at least for the first few times, because we know that somedegree of relapse is almost inevitable. Assuming that the program staff agrees on a grace periodafter an exception event, will the offender be told in advance or be left to guess and gossip aboutit? Issuing threats without follow-through sends a mixed message that mitigates the effectivenessof punishment routines. On the other hand, a program that unerringly punishes offenders for technical violations cannot be expected to reduce recidivism rates because EM is likely to identify more violations thantraditional supervision ( Crowe et al., 2002). Imposing the punishment trilogy of \"certainty,\" \"severity,\" \"immediacy\" on the normal ebb and flow of human relationships is simply unrealisticand negates the common-sense judgment of program staff. An essential tenet of learning theory is that punishment does not change behavior; it temporarily suppresses it . A person may conform to rules to avoid punishment, but once the threat of punishment is removed, the original behavior is likely to reoccur. Drivers typically slow downwhen they observe a police car behind them; they resume their previous speed when the policecar turns onto a different road. Similarly, a higher rate of criminal activity has been observedwhen intensive supervision is ended (MacKenzie and De Li, 2002). Erwin (1990:72) reportedthat among probationers who completed the electronic monitoring program \"there is a pattern ofreturn to drugs and crime among a significant number of cases soon after they are transferred offthe ISP [intensive supervision program] caseload to regular probation supervision.\" In a meta-analysis involving 66,500 offenders receiving intermediate sanctions (e.g., EM, fines, restitution),Smith, Goggin and Gendreau (2002) found no reduction in recidivism after completing aminimum of six months of supervision. The process of applying increasingly severe sanctions, if empirically-established behavioral principles are followed, may also have undesirable side-effects. It prompts anger and resentment.When offenders are released from a correctional facility, they want \"freedom,\" and typicallyview (perhaps unreasonably) parole conditions that include sanctions or mandatory treatment asmore hoops, hurdles, and hassles to overcome. The degree of frustration and hostility expressedby offenders varies, but a visit from a probation officer is seldom a welcomed occasion. A first-hand account of the work of an EM officer in England (Jones, 2005:585) suggests that his joblacks the glamour that a corrections professional might want: Getting a PID [personal identification device] to register can simply mean waitingoutside the property from perhaps the relative safety of the vehicle. However, eventhis can have an element of risk, for instance, having personally had my car (acompany vehicle) attacked on many occasions, including, urinated on from upstairswindows, youths surrounding the car on mass, tyres been let down, as well as evenon numerous occasions being approached in my vehicle by local prostitutes toutingfor business. Punishment does have a legitimate role in rehabilitation, but only as a temporary means of suppressing behavior that is dangerous to self or others. While the dangerous behavior is beingsuppressed, or immediately thereafter, desired behavior should be rewarded. Monitoring appears to reduce recidivism only when it is paired with a treatment program (cf., Bonta, et al., 1999). Without a treatment-only control group, the possibility that the treatment itself might account for any observed improvement cannot be ruled out. Indeed, it could be that the coercive nature ofEM with sanctions might actually reduce whatever treatment effectiveness existed. In summary,a substantial and creditable body of knowledge indicates that a program having sanctions-onlywill result in high compliance in the short term but does not improve compliance in the longterm. Few, if any, programs have used EM primarily or exclusively as a positive reinforcement tool. The following section of this paper outlines what we believe can be the effective use of electronic monitoring without (or with only minimal) negative sanctions. back to top Positive Monitoring Electronic monitoring should place public safety as a priority. Because incapacitation and punishment are short-term solutions to a long-term problem, public safety will substantiallyimprove if decision-makers devise policies based on non-incarceration strategies such as positivereinforcement. The 678-page report of the Re-Entry Policy Council (2004:398) recommendedthat \"community supervision officials should develop a system of graduated positivereinforcements that help to imprint pro-social behaviors and attitudes.\" Outlined below are a fewwell-established incentive-oriented principles that can be used with EM. Reward small steps.Offenders want and deserve recognition for improvements, even if their present behavior is onlya small improvement and does not meet a normally expected standard. When a child is learningto walk, or an adult learning to play a musical instrument, he or she is given praise for what\u2014byadult or professional standards\u2014would be a very inadequate performance. As the behaviorimproves, the standard is raised. The reason for the reward should be made clear to the recipient,and it should occur relatively rapidly and frequently at the outset of the rehabilitation program. Vary the value of the incentives. Positive consequences should vary in economic or symbolic value. Possible options include letters of commendation, verbal praise, reduction of fines, complimentary tickets to sports or music events, and sobriety anniversary celebrations. The moreunexpected and specific the consequence is to the individual's personal interests, the better. Aninexpensive gift that shows that the offender was recognized as a human struggling to \"make it\"in a seemingly indifferent or hostile world is better than a group-oriented formality. One of themost dramatic surprises given to a probationer during the original EM project in Cambridge(MA) was being driven to his work (as a gas station attendant) for two days in a donatedlimousine. He was the \"big man\" of the neighborhood. Financial limitations and agency rulesmean that correctional personnel must be creative in designing appropriate incentives. Tangiblerewards might be distributed at a day reporting center where activities such as drug testing\u2014clearly distinguished from any EM program\u2014normally take place. Behavioral contracts are not an effective way to shape or maintain behavior. There are at least two reasons to avoid contracts or promises as a type of incentive. First, contracts give theoffender the option of breaking the contract, possibly in a moment of impulsive anger thateveryone later regrets. Second, if the conditions of the contract cannot be fulfilled for legitimatereasons, the corrections agent must either ignore the violation or punish the offender. Neither ofthese reactions is satisfactory because it justifies the offender's predisposition to viewcorrectional authorities as malicious, arbitrary, duplicitous, or simply inept. Vary the timing of the incentives. The element of surprise is helpful. Routines may be desirable in matters of maintenance (e.g., paychecks, dinner time), but fixed schedules are not the most effective way to motivate behavior. Consider the example of a virtually useless behavior-changegratuity\u2014the Christmas bonus. Because Christmas bonuses are usually given during the sameweek every year, the gift is no longer a surprise. In fact, employees occasionally complain thatthey did not get as large a bonus as they expected. Employee motivation and goodwill would bebetter fostered if the same expenditure, in goods or money, were spent over the course of theentire year, immediately contingent on desirable employee performance. In terms of social learning theory (cf., Akers and Sellers, 2004), incentives should be given on a \"variable ratio/variable ratio schedule\" (differing amounts / differing times). The initial EMproject used variable schedules of reinforcement to shape prompt attendance of delinquent youthat paid tape-recorded interviews. At the beginning, the youth would arrive as much as 3 hourslate or 3 hours early, occasionally resulting in potential violence between gangs or ethnic groups.An interviewee might receive a $5 bonus for being \"only\" 45 minutes late, then no bonus forbeing 5 minutes early, followed by a pair of highly-desired base-ball tickets when he was 10minutes late but gave a good interview (Schwitzgebel, 1965). The timing, contingency, and valueof the bonuses were unpredictable, but always given in a manner that would not diminish theself-respect of the recipient or make him feel obligated to accept. The typical shelf-life of a positive EM intervention should be less than one year, excluding aftercare. This follows the general treatment guidelines of Cullen and Gendreau (1989), whorecommended interventions of at least 100 hours over a 3- to 4-month period ending in one year.Frequent interaction at the beginning of supervision should be tapered off toward the end as thebehavior becomes maintained by more natural, long-term incentives. A monitoring transmittermight be conceptualized as a \"social prosthetic device\" similar to a walker that is downgraded toa crutch, then to a cane, and finally abandoned. Develop two-way communication. Mobile technologies have the capacity to allow program staff to give incentives based on real-time documented behavior such as attendance at a drug treatment class. The 1969 tactile EM system referenced previously allowed program staff to contactoffenders unobtrusively while they were in a GED (general educational development) class.Some of the two-way signaling at that time was little more than high-tech frivolity, but it wasenjoyed by both parties. Messages should be brief and sporadic as well as unpredictable. Contemporary embodiments of communication technology, such as cell phones and laptops, have become very important to young adult friendships and social identity. These should be used as amedium for reinforcing behavior. A London-based educational project has used pocket PCs andcell phones with picture messaging to send reminders and instructions to at-risk youth (Attewelland Savill-Smith, 2004). When a communication tool becomes the source of unexpected rewardsof sufficiently high perceived value, the device seldom gets inexplicably \"lost.\" Actively intervene. Careful observation of an individual's criminal pattern often reveals a unique sequence of preparatory behaviors. Intervening early in the sequence of intended criminalbehavior (e.g., when an offender gets on the bus to go downtown) is more effective than later inthe sequence (e.g., when the offender enters the game arcade). House detention can, of course,prevent the entire sequence of behavior, but it is overly restrictive and does not allow commonsocial activities such as grocery shopping or going to a movie at night. If the offender has a badfeeling about what is going to happen, this is the time for the offender to contact programpersonnel or a sponsor. Twelve-step programs, for example, often encourage participants tocontact their sponsors in advance of a potential setback. Rewarding desired behavior before unwanted behavior occurs is critical to success. The probationer will not make contact if he or she will be punished. To the contrary, EM participants should be able to signal staff when they are doing something unusually \"good.\" Of course, thesereports need to be checked for accuracy, but verifying positive reports or the \"tall tales\" ofoffenders is much more appealing to staff than checking-out violations. back to top Conclusion The basic proposition of this paper is that electronic monitoring and other mobile technologies should be used to positively reinforce pro-social behavior. Unfortunately, during the past fourdecades electronic monitoring migrated into programs that are generally sanction-oriented and ofquestionable long-term value. Missing from the formal structure of most electronic monitoring programs are concepts such as \"networks of support,\" \"humor,\" \"affection,\" and \"hope.\" The past does not have to determine the future. Advances in context-aware technology (e.g., global positioning systems, sensor-enabled telephones) will certainly provide opportunities forincreased surveillance and information acquisition. As program designers, we can drift toward acallous authoritarianism in which individuals are motivated by fear, or we can design cooperativegroups that are motivated by surprisingly pleasant experiences. The criminal justice system maybe the least likely place to develop an inspiring pro-social communication network. But it is alsothe place where unexpected generosity can most easily change lives. back to top References | Endnotes The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.

Since then, the role of the clergy has evolved and their responsibilities have increased. Today, prison chaplainsprovide an array of services, including \"pastoral counseling, religious teaching and preaching,lead[ing] worship for their own faith, conduct[ing] funeral and/or memorial services and giv[ing]death notices\" (Coleman, 2003, p. 125). Other duties include \"facilitating [inmate] adjustment toprison, visiting prisoners in isolation, helping inmates make plans for their release, counselingand helping inmates' families, [and] providing religious and general education\" (Sundt andCullen, 2002, p. 371). Often classified as a member of the treatment staff, prison chaplains areseen as important agents of social change, with a significant number of inmates attributing theirpost-release successes to these individuals (Sundt and Cullen, 2002; Glaser, 1964). At mid-year 2003, there were more than 1.46 million prisoners under the jurisdiction of federal and state authorities in the United States (Harrison and Karberg, 2004). Of these, about 30percent participate in religious programs and services (Sundt and Cullen, 2002). Although mostAmerican prisons have at least one full-time chaplain, without pastoral assistance many chaplainsare ill equipped to meet the religious needs of inmates. To lighten their workload and to facilitatethe provision of programs and services, correctional chaplains often must recruit, train, andcoordinate religious volunteers (Coleman, 2003; Rogers, 2003). Yet, despite the important rolethese individuals play in rehabilitating criminal offenders, little is known about the men andwomen who volunteer in prison chapel programs. This exploratory study adds to the sparse literature on correctional volunteers and prison ministry programs. The goal of the present article is to provide a profile of individuals involved in prisonministry programs, with foci on personal characteristics, tasks, training and means of recruitment,and an assessment of the experience from the perspective of the prison chaplain volunteer. Thearticle also provides meaningful insights regarding ways correctional administrators mayeffectively recruit and manage chaplain volunteers. back to top Literature ReviewThere is a dearth of empirical literature examining the role and impact of chaplains and chaplain volunteers in today's prisons. In one of the few studies to touch on this issue, Sundt and Cullen (1998; 2002) conducted a national survey of 232 prison chaplains to determine their correctionalorientation. The researchers concluded that although \"chaplains support incapacitation as theprimary goal of prisons, [they] also express high levels of support for rehabilitation\" (2002, p.369). The individual variables examined in the study were sex, race, level of education, age, andreligious affiliation. The sample consisted primarily of Whites (84.2 percent), males (85.2percent), and Protestants (69.4 percent). Approximately 25.7 percent of the chaplains wereCatholics and the remainder were Jewish, Islamic, or some other religious affiliation. The meanage of the chaplains was 56.5. More than 92 percent had a bachelor's degree or higher and 60percent had a master's degree (p. 375). A majority of the chaplains had an average of ten yearsexperience in the institutions where they worked. When queried about the best way torehabilitate inmates, well over one-half (60.2 percent) believed that changing an offender'svalues through religion was the preferred method of treatment. The second most popular responsewas helping inmates with their emotional problems. The least frequently selected response wasproviding inmates with a good education (Sundt and Cullen, 2002, p. 379). There is some evidence that correctional volunteers share these chaplains' sentiments regarding the value of religious programming as an important form of treatment. Tewksbury and Dabney(2004) conducted one of the few studies to date that profiles correctional volunteers. Theresearchers surveyed all of the active volunteers at a medium security prison in the South andreported that a majority of the respondents were involved in the chapel program, while only 8.6percent were involved in recreational programs and other activities. Two-thirds (65.5 percent) ofthe volunteers were men and a majority was white (71.7 percent). The mean age of thevolunteers was 51. The volunteers were highly educated, with approximately 78 percent havingsome post-secondary education and 47 percent having a 4-year degree or more. The typicalvolunteer participated in the chaplain's program for just over five years, while more than one-half participated for three years or more. The volunteers were active participants in the program,\"with the average volunteer being at the institution one day per week for 2.8 hours\" (p. 175).Distance was not an impediment to volunteer participation. Two-thirds of the volunteers traveledat least 30 minutes to arrive at their destinations and 12 percent traveled more than one hour. The volunteers in Tewksbury and Dabney's study gave diverse reasons for participating in the prison ministry program. Although 49.2 percent of the respondents said they had \"a religiouscalling or desire to share religious beliefs/values with others,\" 26.2 percent expressed non-religious reasons, and 18 percent participated in the program because they were asked to do so orbecause they knew someone who was incarcerated (3 percent) (2004, p. 176). Many volunteersstated that the most rewarding aspect of their prison experience was the belief in their work andthat they could make a difference (p. 177). Reflective of this, Tewksbury and Dabney (2004)reported that Male volunteers were more likely than women (41.9 percent vs. 30.8 percent) tovalue feeling that they were helping to change/rehabilitate inmates, while womenwere more likely than men (23.1 percent vs. 3.2 percent) to value the opportunityto share a religious experience with others...[W]hite volunteers were more likelythan non-whites (44.4 percent vs. 30.0 percent) to value helping change/rehabilitateinmates, and non-whites were more likely (20.0 percent vs. 8.3 percent) to valuethe opportunity to share a religious experience...[T]hose age 40 and younger weremore likely (62.5 percent vs. 35.4 percent) to appreciate their volunteer experiencebecause they believed they were agents of change/rehabilitation.... (p. 178). The literature on prison ministry volunteers is sparse, with only the studies by Sundt and Cullen(1998; 2002) and Tewksbury and Dabney (2004) providing insights regarding this population.The present study seeks to add to this important, but clearly understudied, area. back to top Methods Data for the present study were collected during summer 2003 via anonymous surveys distributed to prison ministry volunteers in three Kentucky prisons. Requests for participationwere sent to chaplains in all 14 Kentucky prisons by both the first author and an administratorfrom the Department of Corrections' Central Office. Three chaplains chose to participate. Thesurveys were distributed either at mandatory quarterly volunteer trainings or to volunteers whenthey arrived at the prison to complete their volunteer activities. All surveys were accompanied bypostage-paid return envelopes addressed to the first author at the prison where he served asResearch Director. Despite requests from the researchers, prison chaplains did not maintain acount of the number of surveys distributed; however, a total of 80 survey containing 136variables were provided to the three chaplains for distribution and 41surveys were returned,making the response rate at least 51 percent. back to top Findings Analysis of the demographics of the prison chapel volunteers revealed that a majority are middle-aged white females representing a wide range of religious faiths (see Table 1 ). When asked about their personal experiences with the criminal justice system and about both their ownand their family members' experiences in prison ministries, one in six (17.5 percent) of thevolunteers reported having a prior criminal conviction. Approximately 12.5 percent of thevolunteers reported that they had been on probation and 12.5 percent had been in jail. Fivepercent of the volunteers had also served time in prison. A significant number of volunteers reported that their family members are also active in the general ministry and in prison ministry programs. Indicative of this, 57.9 percent of thevolunteers have at least one family member who is involved in the general ministry and almostone-half (45.9 percent) have a family member who is involved in prison ministry programs. The volunteers in this study possessed lengthy careers as participants in correctional ministry programs. Reflective of this, two-thirds of the volunteers were previously involved with religiousprogramming at a different prison, for an average tenure of more than nine years. Sixty percentof the volunteers reported prior experience in jail-based ministry programs, for an average tenureof nearly 8 years (94 months). Although not as common as their experiences in adult facilities,more than one-quarter (26.8 percent) of the volunteers reportedly had worked in some capacityin religious programming at a juvenile detention center, for an average of more than 4 years (50months). The prison ministry volunteers appear dedicated to their work at the current institution and remain involved for long periods. When asked about the length of time they had worked in thecurrent program, the volunteers reported a mean tenure of 7 years and 4 months. As shown inTable 2 , more than one-half of these individuals reported being an active volunteer at the current prison for more than 5 years. Only one in fourteen (7.3 percent) reported that they had been aprison chapel volunteer for less than one year. The fact that prison chapel volunteers have longevity with their programs is not surprising given that they report very high levels of satisfaction with their work. When asked, \"How satisfied areyou with your experience as a volunteer with the prison Chapel program?\" the mean responsewas 8.75, with fully one in three participants in the sample expressing complete satisfaction (10on a 10-point scale). Clearly, prison chapel volunteers enjoy their work and, as will be discussedbelow, feel that they reap numerous personal rewards from their efforts. The path to becoming a prison chapel volunteer takes many forms. Administrators seeking to initiate or to enhance prison chapel programs may seek volunteers in multiple venues. Table 3 shows that, not surprisingly, the most common sources of referral to prison ministry programsare individuals already involved in ministry work. Other viable sources of referral include thevolunteers' spouses and friends. Most volunteers in prison chapel programs come to their work with minimal formal training for the tasks they are expected to perform. Although two-thirds of the volunteers report that they have been ordained, a majority lacks a formal education to prepare them for their duties. Asevidenced in Table 4 , only one-third of the volunteers have a university/seminary degree and slightly more than one-quarter (26.8 percent) have participated in a mentoring or apprenticeshipprogram. Most common among these volunteers (82.9 percent) is the belief that they havelearned to do their tasks through \"many\" years of experience in ministry work. Table 5 summarizes the many tasks and activities that prison ministry volunteers report performing. As shown here, almost all volunteers report that they engage in some form of teaching inmates. The most frequently reported \"formal\" activity that volunteers engage in ispreaching at the prison; fully two-thirds (65.9 percent) of the volunteers report doing so.Interestingly, relatively few of the volunteers report that they engage in tasks not of a purelyreligious nature, such as counseling regarding personal problems, assisting with transition/re-entry to society, and providing companionship/friendship to inmates. An examination of the tasks that prison chapel volunteers perform in light of their education and training revealed both expected and unexpected findings. Surprisingly, a comparison of self-reported tasks by volunteers who are ordained and those who are not shows little difference intheir activities. The majority (81.5 percent) of ordained volunteers reported preaching at theprison; however, so, too, did one third (35.7 percent) of non-ordained volunteers. Additionally,ordained volunteers were more likely to counsel inmates regard-ing personal problems (44.4percent vs. 21.4 percent) and spiritual issues (77.8 percent vs. 28.6 percent), and work to convertinmates to their faith (25.9 percent vs. 7.1 percent); non-ordained volunteers were more likely towork with inmates regarding society re-entry issues (28.6 percent vs. 11.1 percent). When asked to explain why they chose to volunteer in a prison-based chapel program, the respondents' open-ended responses fell into four general categories. Most common, 50 percent ofall respondents reported feeling called by God to do the work. An additional 22 percent ofrespondents reported that they believed prison ministry volunteer work offered a viableopportunity to share their beliefs with others. Although probably included in the first two typesof responses, 16 percent of the respondents stated they were seeking to provide some form ofdirect assistance to inmates. Finally, one in eight (12 percent) of the respondents reported thatthey began their prison ministry work simply because someone asked them to do so. The reasons given by the volunteers for joining the prison ministry are directly related to the benefits they report receiving from their work. As shown in Table 6 , nearly all of the volunteers report feeling that they are serving God through their volunteer work, with two of every threesaying that their efforts provide them with a sense of purpose. More interesting, however, is thedata showing that 41.5 percent of the respondents experienced a sense of reward from engagingin a mentoring relationship with at least one inmate. Although such outcomes are not reported asa common reason for initially becoming involved with the prison ministry, they appear to be anunanticipated, positive consequence for both the volunteers and the inmates. back to top Discussion This exploratory study seeks to add to the sparse literature on prison ministry programs and correctional volunteers. The implementation of rehabilitative programming in correctionalenvironments is subject to two important but competing concerns. On the one hand, correctionaladministrators must provide high-quality programming for inmates that address theirpsychological, social, spiritual, and practical needs; on the other hand, they must manage theiragencies' ever-shrinking budgets. A possible reconciliation between these opposingresponsibilities lies in the use of prison ministry volunteers. With appropriate training in prisonsecurity protocol and the tenets of diverse faiths, prison chapel volunteers are potentially capableof enhancing and expanding religious programming by providing quality services to inmates whobenefit from their assistance while simultaneously facilitating the conservation of agencies' fiscalresources. Demographically, the volunteers in this article are quite interesting. Unlike the correctional volunteers studied by Tewksbury and Dabney (2004), where most prison chapel volunteers weremiddle-aged white males, a majority of the prison chapel volunteers in this article are middle-aged white females. Similar to the earlier study, however, the volunteers represent a diversity ofreligious faiths, including Protestants, Evangelicals, Catholics, and Muslims. Some of thevolunteers have prior criminal convictions and previously were incarcerated in jail or served timein prison. A significant number of volunteers have family members that are also active in generalministry and prison ministry programs. Although most volunteers gravitated to prison ministryprograms because of referrals by persons actively working in the ministry, others volunteered atthe suggestion of their spouses and friends. Quite surprisingly, most volunteers receive little formal education or training to prepare them for the responsibilities they are entrusted with in prison ministry programs. Though a majority ofvolunteers report that they are ordained, only one-third have university or seminary degrees;even fewer have been trained by a mentor or received instruction in an apprenticeship program.Despite this, most volunteers believe they are well qualified to serve in prison chapel programsbecause their \"many\" years of experience in the ministry have prepared them to do the work. With regard to the tasks they perform, there is little difference between ordained volunteers and non-ordained volunteers. Almost all volunteers report that they engage in teaching inmates, withthe most frequent formal activity being preaching. Additionally, less than 20 percent of allvolunteers report engaging in non-religious tasks such as counseling regarding personal problems,assisting with transition/re-entry to society, or providing companionship/friendship to inmates. In general, the volunteers in this article are extremely dedicated to prison ministry work and remain involved for long periods. More than 56 percent report that they have been doing thistype of volunteer work for more than 5 years. For most, the average tenure at their currentinstitution is more than 7 years. Many volunteers also report having worked at a different prisonfor an average of more than nine years. Still others report long-term involvement with chaplainprograms in jails and juvenile detention centers. Perhaps a primary reason that volunteers have such long tenures with prison chapel programs is that they receive a high degree of satisfaction from their work. A majority of respondentssurveyed rated their satisfaction level as 8.75 on a 10-point scale. This is probably reflective ofthe fact that many feel called by God to do the work. (For similar findings, see Tewksbury andDabney, 2004.) Other volunteers are drawn to prison ministry programs because they view thework as an opportunity to share their beliefs and to provide direct assistance to inmates. back to top Conclusion Most of the volunteers in this study were influenced to work in prison ministries by individuals already in the ministry; however, networking outside of traditional religious channels has hardlybeen exploited. This study's results raise questions about how current knowledge of correctionalvolunteers can be used to enhance recruitment, selection, training, and retention of individuals toserve in prison chapel programs. Noteworthy among the study's findings is the fact that at leastone-third of the prison chapel volunteers have graduated from university and seminary programs.Thus, a reasonable strategy would entail recruiting religion students at selected institutions ofhigher learning and seminaries to serve as volunteers in prison chapel programs. Marketingmaterials containing testimonials from current volunteers who describe the benefits derived fromparticipating in such programs may also be developed for distribution to potential applicants. Prison administrators might also consider partnering with universities and seminaries to develop externship programs for students interested in embarking on a career as a correctional chaplain.The benefits from such programs are two-fold: the students receive hands-on experience workingwith inmates in a correctional setting, and administrators receive qualified and much-needed assistance in providing religious programs to inmates. Another strategy for developing a contingent of prison chapel volunteers involves capitalizing on the network of individuals related to and/or known by current prison staff and chapel volunteers.The current research indicates that almost two-thirds of the volunteers received assistance fromministers, priests, and others active in the ministry to become prison volunteers. Additionally,more than half of the volunteers have family members actively involved in the general ministryand almost half have family members involved in the prison ministry. Prison administrators whoare willing to cultivate relations with staff and members of the community can use theseconnections to locate volunteers and foster interest in religious programming. This study (and the prior research by Tewksbury and Dabney, 2004) provides a limited profile of individuals who volunteer to work in prison chapel programs. Further research is needed todetermine the qualities and qualifications that make volunteers best suited to work in programs ofthis nature, as well as strategies that administrators may employ to effectively recruit and retainthem. Research is also needed to document the nature and adequacy of training provided tovolunteers by prison officials to minimize security breaches and lessen the risk of harm tovolunteers, staff, and inmates. back to top References The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.

Endnotes Jeremy Travis President, John Jay College of Criminal Justice The \"Gender Imbalance\" The Impact of Incarceration on Parent-Child Relationships Impact of Parental Incarceration on Childhood Development Impact by Children's Age Group Reconnecting with Family at the Time of Reentry Looking Forward AS THE NATION debates the wisdom of a fourfold increase in our incarceration rate over the past generation, one fact is clear: Prisons separate prisoners from their families. Every individual sent to prison leaves behind a network of family relationships. Prisoners are the children, parents,siblings, and kin to untold numbers of relatives who are each affected differently by a familymember's arrest, incarceration, and ultimate homecoming. Little is known about imprisonment's impact on these family networks. Descriptive data about the children of incarcerated parents only begin to tell the story. During the 1990s, as the nation'sprison population increased by half, the number of children who had a parent in prison alsoincreased by half\u2014from 1 million to 1.5 million. By the end of 2002, 1 in 45 minor children hada parent in prison (Mumola 2004). 1 These children represent 2 percent of all minor children in America, and a sobering 7 percent of all African-American children (Mumola 2000). With littleif any public debate, we have extended prison's reach to include hundreds of thousands of youngpeople who were not the prime target of the criminal justice policies that put their parents behindbars. In the simplest human terms, prison places an indescribable burden on the relationships between these parents and their children. Incarcerated fathers and mothers must learn to cope with theloss of normal contact with their children, infrequent visits in inhospitable surroundings, and lostopportunities to contribute to their children's development. Their children must come to termswith the reality of an absent parent, the stigma of parental imprisonment, and an altered supportsystem that may include grandparents, foster care, or a new adult in the home. In addition, inthose communities where incarceration rates are high, the experience of having a mother orfather in prison is now quite commonplace, with untold consequences for foster care systems,multigenerational households, social services delivery, community norms, childhooddevelopment, and parenting patterns. Imprisonment profoundly affects families in another, less tangible way. When young men and women are sent to prison, they are removed from the traditional rhythms of dating, courtship,marriage, and family formation. Because far more men than women are sent to prison each year,our criminal justice policies have created a \"gender imbalance\" (Braman 2002), a disparity in the number of available single men and women in many communities. In neighborhoods where incarceration and reentry have hit hardest, the gender imbalance is particularly striking. Youngwomen complain about the shortage of men who are suitable marriage prospects because somany of the young men cycle in and out of the criminal justice system. The results are anincrease in female-headed households and narrowed roles for fathers in the lives of their childrenand men in the lives of women and families in general. As more young men grow up with fewerstable attachments to girlfriends, spouses, and intimate partners, the masculine identity isredefined. The family is often depicted as the bedrock of American society. Over the years, wehave witnessed wave after wave of social policy initiatives designed to strengthen, reunite, orsimply create families. Liberals and conservatives have accused each other of espousing policiesthat undermine \"family values.\" In recent years, policymakers, foundation officers, and opinionleaders have also decried the absence of fathers from the lives of their children. These concernshave translated into a variety of programs, governmental initiatives, and foundation strategies thatconstitute a \"fatherhood movement.\" Given the iconic stature of the family in our vision ofAmerican life and the widespread consensus that the absence of father figures harms futuregenerations, our national experiment with mass incarceration seems, at the very least,incongruent with the rhetoric behind prevailing social policies. At worst, the imprisonment ofmillions of individuals and the disruption of their family relationships has significantlyundermined the role that families could play in promoting our social well-being. The institutionof family plays a particularly important role in the crime policy arena. Families are an integralpart of the mechanisms of informal social control that constrain antisocial behavior. The qualityof family life (e.g., the presence of supportive parent-child relationships) is significant inpredicting criminal delinquency (Loeber and Farrington 1998, 2001). Thus, if families sufferadverse effects from our incarceration policies, we would expect these harmful effects to be feltin the next generation, as children grow up at greater risk of engaging in delinquent and criminalbehavior. The institution of marriage is another important link in the mechanism of informalsocial control. Marriage reduces the likelihood that ex-offenders will associate with peersinvolved in crime, and generally inhibits a return to crime (Laub, Nagin, and Sampson 1998). Infact, marriage is a stronger predictor of desistance from criminal activity than simplecohabitation, and a \"quality\" marriage\u2014one based on a strong mutual commitment\u2014is an evenstronger predictor (Horney, Osgood, and Marshall 1995). Thus, criminal justice policies thatweaken marriage and inhibit spousal commitments are likely to undermine the natural processesof desistance, thereby causing more crime. In short, in developing crime policies, families matter.If our crime policies have harmful consequences for families, we risk undermining the rolefamilies can play in controlling criminal behavior. This chapter examines the impact of incarceration and reentry on families. We begin by viewing the antecedents to the creation of families\u2014the relationships between young men and youngwomen\u2014in communities where the rates of arrest, removal, incarceration, and reentry areparticularly high. Then we discuss imprisonment's impact on relationships between anincarcerated parent and his or her children. Next we examine the effects of parental incarcerationon the early childhood and adolescent development of children left behind. We then observe thefamily's role in reentry. We close with reflections on the impact of imprisonment on prisoners'family life, ways to mitigate incarceration's harmful effects, and ways to promote constructiveconnections between prisoners and their families. back to top The \"Gender Imbalance\" To understand the magnitude of the criminal justice system's impact on the establishment of intimate partner relationships, we draw upon the work of Donald Braman (2002, 2004), ananthropologist who conducted a three-year ethnographic study of incarceration's impact oncommunities in Washington, D.C. In the District of Columbia, 7 percent of the adult African-American male population returns to the community from jail or prison each year. According toBraman's estimates, more than 75 percent of African-American men in the District of Columbia can expect to be incarcerated at some point during their lifetime. One consequence of these highrates of incarceration is what Braman calls a \"gender imbalance,\" meaning simply that there are fewer men than women in the hardest hit communities. Half of the women in the nation's capital live in communities with low incarceration rates. In these communities, there are about 94 menfor every 100 women. For the rest of the women in D.C.\u2014whose neighborhoods have higherincarceration rates\u2014the ratio is about 80 men for every 100 women. Furthermore, 10 percent ofthe District's women live in neighborhoods with the highest incarceration rates, where more than12 percent of men are behind bars. In these neighborhoods, there are fewer than 62 men forevery 100 women. This gender imbalance translates into large numbers of fatherless families in communities with high rates of incarceration. In neighborhoods with a 2 percent male incarceration rate, Braman(2002) found that fathers were absent from more than one-half of the families. But in thecommunities with the highest male incarceration rates\u2014about 12 percent\u2014more than three-quarters of the families had a father absent. This phenomenon is not unique to Washington,D.C., however. In a national study, Sabol and Lynch (1998) also found larger numbers offemale-headed families in counties receiving large numbers of returning prisoners. Clearly, mass incarceration results in the substantial depletion in the sheer numbers of men in communities with high rates of imprisonment. For those men who are arrested, removed, andsent to prison, life in prison has profound and long-lasting consequences for their roles asintimate partners, spouses, and fathers. In the following sections, we will document those effects.Viewing this issue from a community perspective, however, reminds us that incarceration alsoalters the relationships between the men and women who are not incarcerated. In her research onthe marriage patterns of low-income mothers, Edin (2000) found that the decision to marry (orremarry) depends, in part, on the economic prospects, social respectability, and reliability ofpotential husbands\u2014attributes that are adversely affected by imprisonment. Low marriage rates,in turn, affect the life courses of men who have been imprisoned, reducing their likelihood ofdesistance from criminal activity. Thus, the communities with the highest rates of incarcerationare caught in what Western, Lopoo, and McLanahan (2004, 21) call the \"high-crime/low-marriage equilibrium.\" In these communities, women \"will be understandably averse to marriagebecause their potential partners bring few social or economic benefits to the table. Men, whoremain unmarried or unattached to stable households, are likely to continue their criminalinvolvement.\" Braman quotes two of his community informants to illustrate these ripple effectsof the gender imbalance. \"David\" described how the shortage of men affected dating patterns:Oh, yeah, everybody is aware of [the male shortage]. . . . And the fact that [men] know the ratio,and they feel that the ratio allows them to take advantage of just that statistic. 'Well, this womanI don't want to deal with, really because there are six to seven women to every man.' (2002,166) The former wife of a prisoner commented that women were less discerning in their choicesof partners because there were so few men: Women will settle for whatever it is that their man[wants], even though you know that man probably has about two or three women. Just to bewanted, or just to be held, or just to go out and have a date makes her feel good, so she's willingto accept. I think now women accept a lot of things\u2014the fact that he might have another womanor the fact that they can't clearly get as much time as they want to. The person doesn't spend asmuch time as you would [like] him to spend. The little bit of time that you get you cherish.(2002, 167) The reach of our incarceration policies thus extends deep into community life. Even those men and women who are never arrested pay a price. As they are looking for potential partners inmarriage and parenting, they find that the simple rituals of dating are darkened by the longshadow of imprisonment. back to top The Impact of Incarceration on Parent-Child Relationships The Family Profile of the Prisoner PopulationBefore turning to a closer examination of the effects of imprisonment on the relationshipsbetween incarcerated parents and their children, we should first describe the family circumstances of the nation's prisoners. In 1997, about half (47 percent) of state prisoners reported they had never been married. Only 23 percent reported they were married at the time oftheir incarceration, while 28 percent said they were divorced or separated ( Figure 1 ). Yet most prisoners are parents. More than half (55 percent) of all state prisoners reported having at leastone minor child. Because the overwhelming majority of state prisoners are men, incarceratedparents are predominantly male (93 percent). The number of incarcerated mothers, however, hasgrown dramatically in the past decade. Between 1991 and 2000, the number of incarceratedmothers increased by 87 percent, compared with a 60 percent increase in the number ofincarcerated fathers. Of the men in state prison, 55 percent have children\u2014a total of about 1.2million\u2014under the age of 18. About 65 percent of women in state prison are mothers to childrenyounger than 18; their children number about 115,500 (Mumola 2000). A mother's incarceration has a different impact on living arrangements than does that of a father. Close to two-thirds (64 percent) of mothers reported living with their children beforeincarceration, compared with slightly less than half (44 percent) of fathers in 1997. Therefore, asthe percentage of women in prison increases, more children experience a more substantialdisruption. We should not conclude, however, that the imprisonment of a nonresident father haslittle impact on his children. Research has shown that nonresident fathers can make considerablecontributions to the development and well-being of their children (Amato and Rivera 1999;Furstenberg 1993). They contribute to their children's financial support, care, and social supporteven when they are not living in the children's home (Edin and Lein 1997; Hairston 1998;Western and Therefore, a depiction of families' living arrangements onlybegins to describe the nature of the parenting roles played by fathers before they were sent toprison. The national data on incarcerated parents also fail to capture the diversity of parent-child relationships. According to research conducted by Denise Johnston (2001) at the Center forChildren of Incarcerated Parents, it is not uncommon for both incarcerated fathers and mothers tohave children by more than one partner. Furthermore, these parents may have lived with somebut not all of their children prior to their incarceration. This perspective leads to anotherconclusion: Individuals who are incarcerated may also have served as parent figures to childrennot their own\u2014as stepparents or surrogate parents in families that blend children into onehousehold. We know little about the nature of these parent-child relationships. As was noted above, even absent fathers can provide emotional and financial support prior to their incarceration. However,the profiles of incarcerated parents also point to indicia of stress and dysfunction within thesefamilies. More than three-quarters of parents in state prison reported a prior conviction and, ofthose, more than half had been previously incarcerated. During the time leading up to their mostcurrent arrest and incarceration, nearly half were out of prison on some type of conditionalrelease, such as probation or parole, in 1997. Nearly half (46 percent) of incarcerated fatherswere imprisoned for a violent crime, as were one-quarter (26 percent) of the mothers. Mothers inprison were much more likely than fathers to be serving time for drug offenses (35 percentversus 23 percent). Nearly one-third of the mothers reported committing their crime to get eitherdrugs or money for drugs, compared with 19 percent of fathers. More than half of all parents inprison reported using drugs in the month before they were arrested, and more than a third wereunder the influence of alcohol when they committed the crime. Nearly a quarter of incarceratedmothers (23 percent) and about a tenth (13 percent) of incarcerated fathers reported a history ofmental illness (Mumola 2000). Clearly, these individuals were struggling with multiple stressorsthat, at a minimum, complicated their role as parents. The portrait of prisoners' extended family networks is also sobering. According to findings from the Urban Institute's Returning Home (Visher, La Vigne, and Travis 2004) study in Maryland, these networks exhibit high rates of criminal involvement, substance abuse, and family violence(La Vigne, Kachnowski, et al. 2003). In interviews conducted with a sample of men and womenjust prior to their release from prison and return to homes in Baltimore, the Institute's researchers found that about 40 percent of the prisoners reported having at least one relative currentlyserving a prison sentence. Nine percent of the women said they had been threatened, harassed, or physically hurt by their husband, and 65 percent of those who reported domestic violence also reported being victimized by a non-spouse intimate partner. No male respondents reported thiskind of abuse. The women reported that, other than their partners, the highest level of abusecame from other women in their families\u2014their mothers, stepmothers, or aunts. Nearly two-thirds of inmates (62 percent) reported at least one family member with a substance abuse oralcohol problem and more than 16 percent listed four or more family members with histories ofsubstance abuse. These characteristics highlight the high levels of risks and challenges in thefamilies prisoners leave behind. The Strain of Incarceration on FamiliesWe turn next to a discussion of the impact of parental incarceration on the families left behind. One obvious consequence is that the families have fewer financial resources. According to theBureau of Justice Statistics, in 1997 most parents in state prison (71 percent) reported either full-time or part-time employment in the month preceding their current arrest (Mumola 2002). Wagesor salary was the most common source of income among incarcerated fathers beforeimprisonment, 60 percent of whom reported having a full-time job. Mothers, on the other hand,were less likely to have a full-time job (39 percent). For them, the most common sources ofincome were wages (44 percent) or public assistance (42 percent). Very few mothers reportedreceiving formal child support payments (6 percent) (Mumola 2000). During incarceration, theflow of financial support from the incarcerated parent's job stops, leaving the family to eithermake do with less or make up the difference, thereby placing added strains on the newcaregivers. Eligibility for welfare payments under the TANF (Temporary Assistance for NeedyFamilies) program ceases as soon as an individual is no longer a custodial parent\u2014i.e., uponincarceration. In some cases, a caregiver may continue to receive TANF payments when theincarcerated parent loses eligibility, but because these benefits are now \"child-only,\" they arelower than full TANF benefits. Food stamps are also unavailable to incarcerated individuals. New caregivers often struggle to make ends meet during the period of parental incarceration. Bloom and Steinhart (1993) found that in 1992 nearly half (44 percent) of families caring for thechildren of an incarcerated parent were receiving welfare payments under TANF's predecessorprogram, AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children). Under the recent welfare reformlaws, however, TANF support is more limited than in the past, as lifetime eligibility has beencapped at 60 months, work requirements have been implemented, and restrictions have beenplaced on TANF funds for those who have violated probation or parole, or have been convictedof certain drug crimes (Phillips and Bloom 1998). Even under the old AFDC program, mostcaregivers reported that they did not have sufficient resources to meet basic needs (Bloom andSteinhart 1993). Moreover, these economic strains affect more than the family's budget.According to several studies, financial stress can produce negative consequences for caretakers'behavior, including harsh and inconsistent parenting patterns, which, in turn, cause emotional andbehavioral problems for the children (McLoyd 1998). Other adjustments are required as well. Because most prisoners are men, and 55 percent of them are fathers, the first wave of impact is felt by the mothers of their children. Some mothersstruggle to maintain contact with the absent father, on behalf of their children as well asthemselves. Others decide that the incarceration of their children's father is a turning point,enabling them to start a new life and cut off ties with the father. More fundamentally,Furstenberg (1995) found that a partner left behind often becomes more independent and self-sufficient during the period of incarceration, changes that may ultimately benefit the family unitor lead to the dissolution of the relationship. At a minimum, however, these changes augur asignificant adjustment in roles when the incarcerated partner eventually returns home. In some cases, the incarceration period can have another, longer-lasting effect on the legal relationships between parents and children. In 1997, Congress enacted the Adoption and SafeFamilies Act (ASFA) to improve the safety and well-being of children in the foster care systemas well as to remove barriers to the permanent placement, particularly adoption, of these children.2 The ASFA stipulates that \"permanency\" decisions (determinations about a child'sultimate placement) should be made within 12 months of the initial removal of the child from the home. With limited exceptions, foster care placements can last no longer than 15 months, and if a child has been in foster care for 15 out of the previous 22 months, petitions must be filed incourt to terminate parental rights. At least half the states now include incarceration as a reason toterminate parental rights (Genty 2001). This new legislation has far-reaching consequences for the children of incarcerated parents. According to BJS, 10 percent of mothers in prison, and 2 percent of fathers, have at least onechild in foster care (Mumola 2000). Because the average length of time served for prisonersreleased in 1997 was 28 months (Sabol and Lynch 2001), the short timelines set forth in ASFAestablish a legal predicate that could lead to increases in the termination of parental rights forparents in prison (Lynch and Sabol 2001). Philip Genty (2001), a professor at ColumbiaUniversity Law School, made some rough calculations of ASFA's impact. Looking only atreported cases discoverable through a Lexis search, he found, in the five years following ASFA'senactment, a 250 percent increase in cases terminating parental rights due to parentalincarceration, from 260 to 909 cases. In addition to those legal burdens placed on incarcerated parents, the new family care-givers face challenges in forging relationships with the children left behind. Some of these new caregiversmay not have had much contact with the children before the parent's incarceration, so they mustestablish themselves as de facto parents and develop relationships with the children. Contributingto the trauma of this changing family structure, prisoners' children are sometimes separated fromtheir siblings during incarceration because the new network of caregivers cannot care for theentire sibling group (Hairston 1995). In short, when the prison gates close and parents are separated from their children, the network of care undergoes a profound realignment. Even two-parent families experience the strain of lostincome, feel the remaining parent's sudden sole responsibility for the children and thehousehold, and suffer the stigma associated with imprisonment. However, prisoners' familystructures rarely conform to the two-parent model and are more often characterized bynonresident fathers, children living with different parents, and female-headed households. Inthese circumstances, the ripple effects of a mother or father going to prison reach much farther,and grandparents, aunts and uncles, and the foster care system must step into the breach. Inaddition, these extended networks feel the financial, emotional, and familial weight of their newresponsibilities. Incarceration has yet one more effect on the structure of prisoners' families. One of the important functions that families perform is to create assets that are passed along to the next generation.These assets are sometimes quite tangible: Money is saved, real estate appreciates in value, andbusinesses are built. These tangible assets can typically be transferred to one's children.Sometimes the assets are intangible: Social status is achieved, professional networks arecultivated, and educational milestones are reached. These intangible assets can also translate intoeconomic advantage by opening doors for the next generation. Braman asks whether the minimalintergenerational transfer of wealth in black families is related to the high rates of incarcerationamong black men. Taking a historical view, he concludes: The disproportionate incarceration of black men...helps to explain why blackfamilies are less able to save money and why each successive generation inheritsless wealth than their white counterparts. Incarceration acts like a hidden tax, onethat is visited disproportionately on poor and minority families; and while its costsare most directly felt by the adults closest to the incarcerated family member, thefull effect is eventually felt by the next generation as well. (2004, 156) The ripple effects of incarceration on the family are far-reaching. The gender imbalance disturbsthe development of intimate relationships that might support healthy families. Families' financialresources and relationship capabilities are strained at the same time they are scrambling for moreassets to support their incarcerated loved one. Yet, despite the hardships of incarceration, familiescan play an important role in improving outcomes for prisoners and prisoners' children. Severalstudies have shown that the \"quality of care children receive following separation and their ongoing relationships with parents\" are \"instrumental forces in shaping outcomes for children\" (Hairston 1999, 205). According to one study (Sack 1977), the behavioral problems displayed bychildren of incarcerated fathers diminished once the children got to spend time with their fathers. On the other hand, in a small percentage of cases, continued parental involvement may not be in the child's best interests. For example, BJS (Greenfeld et al. 1998) reports that 7 percent ofprisoners convicted of violent crimes were convicted of intimate partner violence. Even moredisturbing are those cases involving child abuse and neglect, where the child's best interestsargue against parental involvement. According to BJS, among inmates who were in prison for asex crime against a child, the child was the prisoner's own child or stepchild in a third of thecases (Langan, Schmitt, and Durose 2003). Yet there has been very little research on the nexusbetween this form of family violence, incarceration, and reentry. Discussion of prisoners convicted of violence within the family only raises larger questions\u2014 questions not answered by current research\u2014about whether some parent-child relationships areso troubled and so characterized by the patterns of parental substance abuse, criminalinvolvement, mental illness, and the intrusions of criminal justice supervision that parentalremoval is a net benefit for the child. It is undoubtedly true that removing a parent involved incertain types of child abuse is better for the child. But we know little about the criticalcharacteristics of the pre-prison relationships between children and their incarcerated parents,especially as to what kind of parents they were, and how their removal affects their children. Even without a deeper understanding of the parenting roles played by America's prisoners, we still must face several incontrovertible, troubling facts. First, expanding the use of prison torespond to crime has put more parents in prison. Between 1991 and 1999, a short eight-yearperiod, the number of parents in state and federal prisons increased by 60 percent, from 452,500to 721,500 (Mumola 2000). By the end of 2002, 3.7 million parents were under some form ofcorrectional supervision (Mumola 2004). Second, many children are left behind when parents areincarcerated. By 1999, 2 percent of all minor children in the United States\u2014about 1.5 million\u2014had a parent in state or federal prison. (If we include parents who are in jail, on probation orparole, or recently released from prison, the estimate of children with a parent involved in thecriminal justice system reaches 7 million, or nearly 10 percent of all minor children in America[Mumola 2000].) Third, the racial disparities in America's prison population translate intosubstantial, disturbing racial inequities in the population of children affected by our current levelsof imprisonment. About 7 percent of all African-American minor children and nearly 3 percentof all Hispanic minor children in America have a parent in prison. In comparison, barely 1percent of all Caucasian minor children have a parent in prison (Mumola 2000). Finally, most ofthe children left behind are quite young. Sixty percent are under age 10, while the average childleft behind is 8 years old. In this era of mass incarceration, our criminal justice system casts a wide net that has altered the lives of millions of children, disrupting their relationships with their parents, altering thenetworks of familial support, and placing new burdens on such governmental services as schools,foster care, adoption agencies, and youth-serving organizations. As Phillips and Bloom succinctlyconcluded, \"by getting tough on crime, the United States has gotten tough on children\" (1998,539). These costs are rarely included in our calculations of the costs of justice. Parent-Child Relationships during ImprisonmentWhen a parent is arrested and later incarcerated, the child's world undergoes significant, sometimes traumatic, disruption. Most children are not present at the time of their parent's arrest,and arrested parents typically do not tell the police that they have minor children ( ABA 1993).Family members are often reluctant to tell the children that their parent has been incarceratedbecause of social stigma (Braman 2003). Therefore, the immediate impact of an arrest can bequite traumatizing\u2014a child is abruptly separated from his or her parent, with little informationabout what happened, why it happened, or what to expect.The arrest and subsequent imprisonment of a parent frequently results in a significant realignment of the family's arrangements for caring for the child, depicted in Figure 2 . Not surprisingly, the nature of the new living arrangements depends heavily on which parent is sent to prison. Recall that about two-thirds of incarcerated mothers in state prison lived with theirchildren before they were imprisoned. Following the mother's incarceration, about a quarter (28percent) of their children remain with their fathers. Most children of incarcerated mothers,however, are cared for by an extended family that is suddenly responsible for another mouth tofeed and child to raise. More than half of these children (53 percent) will live with a grandparent,adding burdens to a generation that supposedly has already completed its child-rearingresponsibilities. Another quarter of these children (26 percent) will live with another relative,placing new duties on the extended family. Some children have no familial safety net: almost 10percent of incarcerated mothers reported that their child was placed in foster care (Mumola2000). 3 The story for incarcerated fathers is quite different. Less than half (44 percent) lived with theirchildren before prison; once they are sent to prison, most of their children (85 percent) will livewith the children's mother. Grandparents (16 percent) and other relatives (6 percent) play a muchsmaller role in assuming child care responsibilities when a father in incarcerated. Only 2 percentof the children of incarcerated men enter the foster care system. In sum, a child whose father issent to prison is significantly less likely to experience a life disruption, such as moving in withanother family member or placement in a foster home. The nation's foster care system has become a child care system of last resort for many children with parents in prison. Research by the Center for Children of Incarcerated Parents (Johnston1999) found that, at any given time, 10 percent of children in foster care currently have a mother\u2014and 33 percent have a father\u2014behind bars. Even more striking, 70 percent of foster childrenhave had a parent incarcerated at one time or another during their time in foster care. When a parent goes to prison, the separation between parent and child is experienced at many levels. First, there is the simple fact of distance. The majority of state prisoners (62 percent) areheld in facilities located more than 100 miles from their homes (Mumola 2000). Because prisonfacilities for women are scarce, mothers are incarcerated an average of 160 miles away fromtheir children (Hagan and Coleman 2001). The distance between prisoners and their families ismost pronounced for District of Columbia residents. As a result of the federal takeover of theDistrict's. prison system, defendants sentenced to serve felony time are now housed in facilitiesthat are part of the far-flung network of federal prisons. In 2000, 12 percent of the District'sinmates were held in federal prisons more than 500 miles from Washington. By 2002, thatproportion had risen to 30 percent. Nineteen percent are in prisons as far away as Texas andCalifornia (Santana 2003). Not surprisingly, in an analysis of BJS data, Hairston and Rollin(2003, 68) found a relationship between this distance and family visits: \"The distance prisonerswere from their homes influenced the extent to which they saw families and friends. The fartherprisoners were from their homes, the higher the percentage of prisoners who had no visitors inthe month preceding the survey....Those whose homes were closest to the prison had the mostvisits.\" Geographic distance inhibits families from making visits and, for those who make the effort, imposes an additional financial burden on already strained family budgets. Donald Braman tellsthe story of Lilly, a District resident whose son Anthony is incarcerated in Ohio (Braman 2002).When Anthony was held in Lorton, a prison in Virginia that formerly housed prisoners from theDistrict, she visited him once a week. Since the federal takeover, she manages to make onlymonthly visits, bringing her daughter, Anthony's sister. For each two-day trip, she spendsbetween $150 and $200 for car rental, food, and a motel. Added to these costs are her moneyorders to supplement his inmate account and the care packages that she is allowed to send twicea year. She also pays about $100 a month for the collect calls he places. She lives on a fixedincome of $530 a month. Given these realities, the extent of parent-child contact during incarceration is noteworthy. Mothers in prison stay in closer contact with their children than do fathers. According to BJS, nearly 80 percent of mothers have monthly contact and 60 percent have at least weekly contact. Roughly 60 percent of fathers, by contrast, have monthly contact, and 40 percent have weekly contact with their children (Mumola 2000). These contacts take the form of letters, phone calls,and prison visits. Yet, a large percentage of prisoners serve their entire prison sentence withoutever seeing their children. More than half of all mothers, and 57 percent of all fathers, neverreceive a personal visit from their children while in prison. Particularly disturbing is Lynch and Sabol's finding (2001) that the frequency of contact decreases as prison terms get longer. Between 1991 and 1997, as the length of prison sentencesincreased, the level of contact of all kinds\u2014calls, letters, and visits\u2014decreased ( Figure 3 ). This is especially troubling in light of research showing that the average length of prison sentences isincreasing in America, reflecting more stringent sentencing policies. Thus, prisoners cominghome in the future are likely to have had fewer interactions with their children, a situation thatfurther weakens family ties and makes family reunification even more difficult. In addition to the significant burden imposed by the great distances between prisoners and their families, corrections policies often hamper efforts to maintain family ties across the prison walls.The Women's Prison Association (1996) has identified several obstacles to constructive familycontacts, some of which could easily be solved. The association found that it is difficult to getsimple information on visiting procedures, and correctional administrators provide little help inmaking visiting arrangements. The visiting procedures themselves are often uncomfortable orhumiliating. Furthermore, little attention is paid to mitigating the impact on the children ofvisiting a parent in prison. Elizabeth Gaynes, director of the Osborne Association in New York City, tells a story that captures the emotional and psychological impact of a particular correctional policy upon a younggirl who had come to visit her father. Because inmates were not allowed to handle money, theprison had drawn a yellow line three feet in front of the soda vending machines. Only visitorscould cross that line. The father could not perform the simple act of getting his daughter a soda.If he wanted one, he had to ask his daughter to get it. According to Ms. Gaynes, this interactionrepresented an unnecessary and damaging role transformation; the child had become theprovider, the parent had become the child. 4 Family Contact during Imprisonment: Obstacles and Opportunities For a number of reasons, it is difficult to maintain parent-child contact during a period of incarceration. For one thing, many prisons narrowly define the family members who are grantedvisiting privileges. The State of Michigan's corrections department, for example, promulgatedregulations in 1995 restricting the categories of individuals who are allowed to visit a prisoner.The approved visiting list may include minor children under the age of 18, but only if they arethe prisoner's children, stepchildren, grandchildren, or siblings. Prisoners who are neither thebiological parents nor legal stepparents of the children they were raising do not have thisprivilege. Finally, a child authorized to visit must be accompanied by either an adult who is animmediate family member of the child or of the inmate, or who is the child's legal guardian. 5 Many prisoners' extended family networks, including girlfriends and boyfriends who are raisingprisoners' children, are not recognized in these narrow definitions of \"family.\" 6 Limitations on visiting privileges are commonly justified on security or management grounds, but fail torecognize the complexity of the prisoner's familial networks. Rather than allowing the prisoner todefine the \"family\" relationships that matter most, the arbitrary distinctions of biology or legalstatus are superimposed on the reality of familial networks, limiting meaningful contact thatcould make a difference to both prisoner and child. Telephone contact is also burdened by prison regulations and by controversial relationships between phone companies and corrections departments. Prisoners are typically limited in thenumber of calls they can make. Their calls can also be monitored. The California Department ofCorrections interrupts each call every 20 seconds with a recorded message: \"This is a call from aCalifornia prison inmate.\" Most prisons allow prisoners to make only collect calls, and thosecalls typically cost between $1 and $3 per minute, even though most phone companies now charge less than 10 cents per minute for phone calls in the free society (Petersilia 2003). Telephone companies also charge between $1.50 and $4 just to place the collect call, while a fee is not charged for collect calls outside of prison. The high price of collect calls reflects sweetheart arrangements between the phone companies and corrections agencies, under which the prisons receive kickbacks for every collect call, about40 to 60 cents of every dollar. This arrangement translates into a substantial revenue source forcorrections budgets. In 2001, for example, California garnered $35 million, based on $85 millionof total revenue generated from prison calls. Some states require, by statute or policy, that theserevenues pay for programs for inmates. Most states simply deposit this money into the generalbudget for their department of corrections. Yet who bears these additional costs for maintaining phone contact with prisoners? The families of prisoners do, of course. In a study conducted by the Florida House of RepresentativesCorrections Committee (1998), family members reported spending an average amount of $69.19per month accepting collect phone calls. According to this report, \"Several family memberssurveyed stated that, although they wanted to continue to maintain contact with the inmate, theywere forced to remove their names from the inmate's approved calling list because they simplycould not afford to accept the calls\" (1998, 23). This monopolistic arrangement between phone companies and prisons makes families the unwitting funders of the prisons holding their loved ones. In essence, the states have off-loadedupwards of hundreds of millions of dollars of prison costs on to prisoners' families.Subsequently, families are placed in the unacceptable position of either agreeing to accept thecalls, thereby making contributions to prison budgets, or ceasing phone contact with their lovedones. Of course, there are other, deeper costs attached to this practice. If a family chooses tolimit (or stop) these phone calls, then familial ties are weakened and the support system thatcould sustain the prisoner's reintegration is damaged. If the family chooses to pay the phonecharges, then those financial resources are not available for other purposes, thereby adding to thestrain the household experiences. In recent years, efforts to reform prison telephone policies havebeen successful in several states. 7 Yet, while these reform efforts are under way, tens of thousands of families are setting aside large portions of their budgets to pay inflated phone billsto stay in touch with their imprisoned family members. Fortunately, a number of communities have implemented programs designed to overcome the barriers of distance, cost, and correctional practices that reduce contact between prisoners andtheir families. For example, Hope House, an organization in Washington, D.C., that connectsincarcerated fathers with their children in the District, hosts summer camps at federal prisons inNorth Carolina and Maryland where children spend several hours a day for a week visiting withtheir fathers in prison. Hope House has also created a teleconference hookup with federal prisonsin North Carolina, Ohio, and New Mexico so that children can go to a neighborhood site to talkto their fathers in prison. In another instance, a Florida program called \" Reading and FamilyTies\u2014Face to Face\" also uses technology to overcome distance. Incarcerated mothers and theirchildren transmit live video recordings via the Internet. These sessions occur each week, last anhour, and are available at no cost to the families. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice in1992 initiated the Girl Scouts Beyond Bars program, the first mother-daughter visitation programof its kind. Twice a month, more than 500 girls across the country, much like other girls theirage, participate in Girl Scout programs, but in this program these Girl Scouts meet their mothersin prison. Finally, in Washington State, the McNeil Island Correction Center has launched aprogram that teaches incarcerated fathers the skills of active and involved parenting, encouragesthem to provide financial support for their children, and facilitates events to bring prisonerstogether with their families. These programs\u2014and many others like them\u2014demonstrate that, with a little creativity and a fair amount of commitment, corrections agencies can find ways to foster ongoing, constructiverelationships between incarcerated parents and their children. It seems particularly appropriate, inan era when technology has overcome geographical boundaries, to harness the Internet to bridgethe divide between prisons and families. Yet the precondition for undertaking such initiatives isthe recognition that corrections agencies must acknowledge responsibility for maintaining their prisoners' familial relationships. If these agencies embraced this challenge for all inmates\u2014and were held accountable to the public and elected officials for the results of these efforts\u2014thequality of family life for prisoners and their extended family networks would be demonstrablyimproved. back to top Impact of Parental Incarceration on Childhood Development Limits of Existing ResearchHaving examined the impact of incarceration on the institution of family and the relationships of incarcerated parents with their children, we turn next to an assessment of incarceration's impacton the children involved. Given the current state of research, it is very difficult to measure theconsequences for children when a mother or father is arrested, convicted, sent to prison, andreturned home. Very few studies have been conducted that directly examine the lives of thechildren of incarcerated parents. Most of these studies suffer from methodological limitations inthat they examine only a small sample of children or fail to use appropriate comparison groups.Few studies use standardized assessment tools to measure the emotional and psychological well-being of these children. Few researchers talk to the children themselves, relying instead onparental or caregiver opinions to construct a picture of the child's changing world. Ideally, wecould draw upon one or more longitudinal studies that assessed the children's well-being, thenature of the parent-child relationships, and the changing family environment beginning at theparent's arrest and continuing through the trial (when the parent may be in jail or may bereleased on bond), to the point of sentencing, throughout the period of incarceration (includingthe moment of the parent's release from prison), ending with the dynamics of post-prisonadjustment. Unfortunately, no such study exists. The extant sparse research literature only underscores the importance of more research in this area. These studies suggest that children of incarcerated parents are more likely to exhibit lowself-esteem, depression, emotional withdrawal from friends and family, and inappropriate ordisruptive behavior at home and in school. Two studies, each with a very small sample size,suggested that children of incarcerated parents may be more likely than their counterparts toenter the criminal justice system (Johnston 1991, 1993). 8 One way of assessing the impact of incarceration on children is to draw connections betweenother research and our general understanding of the collateral costs of imprisonment. Forexample, several studies have found that children of young and unmarried parents experiencebehavioral problems, unstable family relationships, and diminished economic support (Amatoand Rivera 1999; Hagan Howard 1997; Wu andMartinson 1993). Similarly, economic strain can lead to harsh and inconsistent parenting, whichcan lead to behavioral problems in the children in the household (McLoyd 1998). Reducedfinancial resources can also lead to increased exposure to abuse in the family (InternationalSociety for Traumatic Stress Studies 2003). 9 Finally, children in single-parent households, particularly those born to single mothers, have higher rates of incarceration as they grow up.Indeed, as Harper and McLanahan (1999) have found, children growing up with stepparents havestill higher rates of incarceration. So, to the extent that incarceration increases economic strain,the number of single-parent households, and absent fathers, then our imprisonment policies arelikely to result in more developmental challenges and criminal justice involvement for thechildren left behind. Understanding Parental LossWe can also draw upon the general literature exploring how parental loss affects child development to create some hypotheses about the impact of parental incarceration. According tothis literature, children always experience the loss of a parent as a traumatic event. Whether theloss is due to death, divorce, moving away, or incarceration, this event has negative consequences, including attachment difficulties, anger, depression, regression, and other antisocial behaviors. Similarly, a traumatic event in a child's life diverts energy from thedevelopmental work that child is normally performing. When life becomes overwhelming for achild, emotional survival may take precedence over developmental tasks, resulting in delayeddevelopment, regression, or other maladaptive coping strategies (Wright and Seymour 2000).Given these general principles of child development, parental incarceration should be viewed asa traumatic event, limiting the child's emotional growth, producing stress and anger, andisolating the child from needed social supports. It is also well documented in the child development literature that children have difficulty coping with uncertainty. The criminal justice process is filled with uncertainty. A child might have tolive with such questions as, \"Will Mom be arrested again?\" \"Will Dad be convicted and, if so,sent to prison? If so, how long will he be there?\" \"Will Mom get released on parole? If so, willshe be sent back to prison if she uses drugs again, or if she is in the wrong place at the wrongtime?\" This uncertainty, which is inherent in the workings of our criminal justice system, isoften compounded by the family's reluctance to tell children exactly what is happening to theirparents. In his ethnographic study in Washington, D.C., Braman (2002) found that most familymembers rarely discuss their relative's incarceration at all outside the immediate family, even inneighborhoods where incarceration rates are high. Most family members explained that theirsilence stemmed from concerns about the stigma associated with incarceration. Although well-intentioned as a protective response, withholding basic information about a parent's status mayonly heighten children's feelings of stress and uncertainty. Finally, the children themselves must deal with the issue of stigma. When a mother or father is imprisoned, a child may experience the disapproval of his or her peers, teachers, or other familymembers, resulting in feelings of shame and low self-esteem. Perhaps in neighborhoods of a highconcentration of incarceration among the adults, losing one's parent to prison is so common thatthe social stigma is diminished, but the experience still requires the child to work through acomplex set of feelings about the actions of the parent in prison. In addition, even those childrenwho are coping well with parental incarceration may have the added challenge of overcomingthe stereotype that they are destined for a life of behavioral problems and failure. back to top Impact by Children's Age Group The child development literature also provides a framework for assessing the differential impact of parental incarceration on children of various ages. The chart developed by Gabel and Johnston(1995) clarifies the intersection between developmental markers and the removal of a parent toprison ( Table 1 ). For example, among infants (0-2 years), parental incarceration's major effect is likely a disruption of parental bonding, with the potential for later attachment difficulties.Research on this age group also shows, however, that infants can recover quickly from the lossof a parent if they experience a new, nurturing, care-giving relationship (Shonkoff and Phillips2000). During the early childhood years (2-6 years), children have a greater ability to perceiveevents around them, but have not yet developed the skills to process traumatic occurrences.Children at this age have not yet completely separated themselves from their parents, so theytend to perceive threats or harm to their parents or caregivers as directed at themselves. Severalstudies suggest that traumatic stress at this age may have profound long-term effects, particularlyif there is no intervention to help the child sort through those experiences (Furman 1983). In the middle childhood years (7-10 years), when children are developing their social skills and a sense of independence, separation from a parent creates a sense of loss because a role model istaken away. If a child has poor coping skills to begin with, and particularly if he or she movesfrom home to home following the parent's departure, such disruptions may accelerate a spiral ofstrain in the child's life. Johnston and Carlin (1996) use the term \"enduring trauma\" to describea situation where a child experiences several traumatic events with no time to recover and wherethe cumulative effect may overwhelm the child's ability to cope. A child experiencing this levelof trauma may display aggression, hypervigilance, anxiety, concentration problems, and withdrawal. The impact of incarceration on adolescents (11 to 18 years) is likely quite different. Adolescence is a time when young people test boundaries, begin to navigate the world of romanticrelationships, exercise more independence, explore the adult world of work, and develop a senseof self. The arrest and incarceration of an adolescent's parent can derail those transitions toadulthood. These children may question the authority of the incarcerated parent and doubt theparent's concern for them. They may take on new roles as parent figures to fill the void left bythe incarcerated parent. Some studies have shown an increase in dependence and developmentalregression among adolescents of incarcerated parents (Johnston 1992). About 1.5 million minor children have a parent in prison, most frequently a father. In many ways, these children are no different from others of their age group, but they are experiencing adistinctive disruption in their lives. They have the same emotional needs to bond with a parent orother caregiver, to establish themselves as unique individuals in a social context, and to test theirindependence from the adults in their lives. All these development processes are made morecomplicated by the loss of a parent to prison, and more complicated still if the parent wasarrested for behavior involving harm to the family or child. back to top Reconnecting with Family at the Time of Reentry In this section, we shift our focus from an inquiry into the impact of incarceration on parent- child relationships and child development to ask what role prisoners expect their families to playin the reentry process, what role families actually play, and what consequences befall familiesduring this critical period. When prisoners return home, they face multiple hurdles, many of which relate directly to the functioning of their families. They need to find housing, which may be with their relatives orimmediate families. They need to find employment, which could add income to family budgets.Some have health concerns and may need to receive care for an HIV infection, securemedication for mental illness, or find substance abuse treatment to reduce the risk of relapse, allof which, if successful, would avert additional burdens and risks for their families. Many willowe the state child support payments, which, according to an extensive analysis in Colorado andMassachusetts, averaged more than $16,000 (Thoennes 2003). 10 Most prisoners will be under legal supervision, bringing a state parole agency into their homes and lives. The Returning Home StudyIn its Returning Home study in Maryland, the Urban Institute provides the first empirical look at the complex issues of family support for returning prisoners (La Vigne, Kachnowski, et al. 2003). The research team constructed a \"Family Relationship Quality Scale\" to assess the qualityof familial connections . 11 This scale was repeated four times over the continuum of the project \u2014twice in the pre-release interview (first regarding family relationships before prison and againregarding prisoners' expectations for these relationships after release) and once in each of the twopost-release interviews conducted about one and four months after release. The Returning Homestudy reveals interesting dynamics in the prisoners' perceptions, expectations, and experiences offamily support. Prisoners characterized their family relationships as more close than distant. Thisconclusion is based on respondents' scores on the scale, with mean values that range from one tofour, one representing distant family relationships and four representing close familyrelationships (Visher et al. 2004, 110). During every stage of data collection, respondentsprovided mean scores that exceeded three, indicating that these family relationships wereconsidered close. They were also optimistic about renewing those relationships after their release;more than three-quarters expected this would be \"very easy\" or \"pretty easy\" to do. Interestingly,the prisoners expected their families to be more supportive after their release from prison thanthey had been before their incarceration. This finding is subject to a number of possibleinterpretations. Perhaps these families were undergoing strain at the time of the arrest. Perhaps there had been an improvement in family support during the prison sentence. More likely, the prisoners\u2014all of whom were near release at the time of the interview\u2014were projecting theirhopes that their families would be supportive during the reentry phase. The returning prisoners had very concrete expectations of the kinds of support their families would provide. Half of the women and 39 percent of the men expected their families wouldprovide financial support. Well over half of the women (61 percent) and about half of the men(52 percent) planned on talking to a relative about getting a job. At least two-thirds of them (75percent of women, 63 percent of men) expected to live with family members after their releasefrom prison, including about one-third with their mothers or stepmothers, and less than a quarterwith an intimate partner. Importantly, they viewed family support as more than just providingmoney, jobs, or housing: Half of the inmates surveyed said that this support would be animportant factor in keeping them out of prison. These expectations were generally realized. Nearly half of the released prisoners slept at a family member's home the first night they were back in the community. Nearly half sought assistancefrom relatives in finding a job. As a general matter, more than 80 percent of the sampleinterviewed about a month after release \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that their families hadbeen supportive. In fact, when these ex-prisoners were interviewed again a few months later,these percentages increased to about 90 percent. Furthermore, the share that believed familysupport was important to staying out of prison also increased. It seems plausible that, as otherchallenges to successful reentry proved more difficult to overcome, the relative value of familysupport was enhanced. These findings from Returning Home underscore the importance of family in the reentry process. When facing the prospects of succeeding in the outside world, prisoners place a high value on the support that their families will provide. Moreover, families generally keep their end of thebargain, becoming even more important with the passage of time. Future analysis of theReturning Home project will shed even more light on the dynamics of these familialrelationships. La Bodega de la FamiliaOther research suggests that, as critical as family support may be to successful reentry, it often comes with a price. The most insightful research on this issue comes from La Bodega de laFamilia, a demonstration project launched on New York City's Lower East Side in 1996 by theVera Institute of Justice (Sullivan et al. 2002). La Bodega's mission was to test the propositionthat support provided to families of offenders with histories of drug abuse could reduce their druguse and their criminal activity. The intervention was called \"family case management,\" a novelapproach to the problems of drug use and crime that utilizes the strengths of families toinfluence the behavior of a family member who is under criminal justice supervision. Althoughthe overarching goal was to reduce the drug use and criminal activity of the family memberunder supervision, the immediate goal was to strengthen families so they could, in turn, supportthe drug user during treatment (Sullivan et al. 2002). In La Bodega, the case manager spends considerable time with the offender's family. Together, they construct an \"ecomap,\" which illustrates the public and community agencies on which thefamily relies, in order to find ways to coordinate existing services in the family's best interest.They construct a \"genogram,\" a map of the family network that allows the drug offender toidentify potential sources of support within the family. With these two analyses in hand, thefamily case manager, the offender, and the probation or parole officer construct a \"family actionplan,\" which might include drug treatment for the offender, a support group for the familymembers, or counseling for a child in the family who faces difficulties in school. Based on thisplan, La Bodega staff members become advocates for the family in approaching social serviceagencies and provide 24-hour crisis interventions when an arrest, relapse, or potential evictionoccurs.An evaluation of La Bodega found that the program did result in improvements in family members' lives: they were receiving more medical and social services and their health had improved. The evaluation also found that drug use in the target population declined, just as theprogram designers had hoped. While 86 percent of the participants had used at least onesubstance during the month prior to joining the program, this proportion declined to 50 percentafter six months in the program\u2014a statistically significant reduction greater than that found in acomparison group. The participants' overall physical health also improved. Finally, programparticipants were also about half as likely to be arrested and convicted for a new offense thanmembers of the comparison group, but the numbers were too small to draw statistically soundconclusions. There were two surprises in the evaluation, however. First, there had been no increase in the proportion of La Bodega participants who received drug treatment, nor in the amount of timespent in treatment. So, these impressive declines in drug use came about without greater relianceon traditional treatment programs. Family support apparently can make a difference in and ofitself. But the research also found that, notwithstanding improvements in their services, supportnetworks, and health status, the families participating in the La Bodega program reported higherrates of emotional problems and stress than at the beginning of the program, and higher than inthe comparison group. The evaluator suggested a possible explanation: \"Perhaps as aconsequence of having the issues surrounding drug abuse out on the table and having to dealwith them openly, the La Bodega users and their family members experienced increased conflictin their relationships\" (Sullivan 1993, 51). For program participants, the average overall \"supportindex\"\u2014the measure of family support as experienced by the drug-using member\u2014actuallydropped during the six-month study, while it increased in the comparison group. As theevaluation concluded, \"These unexpected results may point to the emotional burdens that LaBodega placed on the families and drug users with whom it worked\" (Sullivan 1993, 51). The story of La Bodega carries two important lessons pertaining to families' role at the point of reentry. First, families matter. They provide the innermost concentric circle of support forreturning prisoners. 12 Providing support for families can translate into behavioral changes for the individual coming out of prison. Drug use can be reduced without increased reliance ontraditional treatment, an important reminder in these times of fiscal constraints. Second, this ishard work for families. Even with a dedicated family case manager, a crisis intervention teamavailable around the clock, and improvements in service coordination and health care, the familystill feels the stress of helping a family member in need. If we are to design policies that supportfamilies, we must remember to pay attention to the family's emotional needs. The experience ofLa Bodega, now incorporated into the work of a new national nonprofit called Family Justice,points the way toward a new form of service delivery for returning prisoners that strengthens theability of families to provide support. In sum, this recent research from Maryland and New York City underscores the centrality of family in the reentry process. Prisoners have high expectations of family support that are oftenmet. However, when families play a more active role in supporting the ex-offender'stransformation toward pro-social behavior\u2014particularly moving away from substance abuse\u2014they pay a price. Our challenge is to work with prisoners and their families to maximize thesupport they can provide to each other, giving families the tools necessary for the hard work offamily interventions, and providing the family network with external sources of emotional andother sustenance. This research suggests that, if done properly, this form of intervention mighteffectively ease the transition from prison, reduce substance abuse, and reduce crime. back to top Looking Forward Imprisonment causes ripple effects that are felt throughout a prisoner's family network. The policies that have resulted in the imprisonment of well over a million people have magnifiedthose effects in a strong undercurrent that is eroding the familial infrastructure of America'spoorest communities. Virtually every social institution that deals with children\u2014includingfamilies, schools, child welfare agencies, foster care, and kinship care systems\u2014is touched by the high rates of parental imprisonment. At the center of these community institutions are children\u20141.5 million of them\u2014who are buffeted about between prison visits, time with fosterparents, and life with grandparents and other new adults in their lives. These children are likelyto grow up in families that have been weakened, increasing the challenges they face in stayingout of the criminal justice system and leading productive lives. As they reach early adulthood,they will find that their choices of life partners are more limited than a generation ago, and theirfamily structures will be quite different. In view of the negative effects stemming from current imprisonment policies, we must ask whether society has an obligation to mitigate these harms. The research literature provides somelimited guidance as we consider the efficacy of policies that would reflect such a socialcommitment. Keeping families strong would reduce future criminality, enhance childdevelopment, reduce child and family trauma and stress, and increase the likelihood that thechildren left behind would lead productive lives. Beyond these calculations of preventable harm,the next question pertains to who would be responsible for carrying out policies that wouldproduce these results. Certainly there is much more that corrections agencies could do, but theywould first have to see family strengthening as part of their mission. This, in turn, would requiregovernors and state legislatures to lead efforts to expand both the mission statements and thefinancial support of state departments of corrections. With this support, corrections agenciescould improve their visitation policies, encourage rather than discourage phone calls, providevideo links between prisons and community centers, find secure means for Internetcommunications between prisoners and families, bring families to their prisons, create familyadvocate positions within their organizations, eliminate the imposition of child support paymentsduring the incarceration period, offer classes in parenting skills, and assist prisoners in assertingtheir rights in custody proceedings. We have no shortage of ideas, just a lack of mandate and theneeded resources to carry out the new mandate. Yet even if corrections agencies were provided adequate resources to implement a new mission to support families, they would need substantial assistance from the community. The existingnetwork of agencies that serve children would need to recognize that these children need specialattention when their parents go to prison. If communities embraced a mandate to support thefamilies of incarcerated community members, a broad consortium of agencies would be calledupon to meet the mandate. Schools would need to offer counseling to children at critical stages inthe criminal justice process. Foster care agencies would have to ascertain whether a parent inprison would serve as a suitable parent upon release before moving for the termination ofparental rights. Youth-serving organizations would need to help young people with familymembers in the justice system work through their feelings of shame, anger, confusion, anddenial. Government would have to fund a network of nonprofit agencies, such as Hope House, toprovide the supportive environment where children could talk to their parents over video links orInternet connections. In addition, at the point of reentry, organizations similar to La Bodega de laFamilia would need to be deployed to support the family networks that struggle to absorb thereality of a family member's return. Organizing this effort would require a community-widecoalition, with strong support from local government, and partnerships with a state correctionsagency committed to the same goals\u2014to recognize the important role that families can play insuccessful reintegration, to minimize harm experienced by the children of incarcerated parents,and to promote strong and healthy families for each prisoner. back to top Endnotes The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.

College Student Poll U.S. college students who are strongly religious differ markedly from the least religious students on political identification and moral issues, according to a survey conducted by the HigherEducation Research Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles. The poll was based onresponses from 3,680 juniors on 46 campuses nationwide. The survey found that about one-fifthof the collegians were \"highly religious\" and that another one-fifth ranked very low on religiousactivities, such as attending worship services and reading sacred texts. Women were significantlymore religious than men. Other findings include: Among those who called themselves politically conservative, 50 percent showed highlevels of religious commitment; 18 percent of political liberals showed high commitmentlevels. Capital punishment was opposed by 38 percent of the highly religious and by 23 percentof the least religious. Just seven percent of the highly religious thought it was alright for people who haveknown each other \"a very short time\" to have sex; 80 percent of the least religious said itwas all right. Of the highly religious, 24 percent wanted abortion to remain legal, compared with 79percent of the least religious. Of the highly religious, 38 percent said they would support \"laws prohibiting homosexualrelationships,\" compared with 17 percent of the least religious. Of the highly religious, 17 percent wanted marijuana legalized, compared with 64 percentof the least religious. States Support Education LawMany educators dislike the federal No Child Left Behind Act, but states are complying. The number of states on track to: Identify dangerous schools\u201447 percent Report achievement by income and racial groups \u201433 percent Identify which schools need improvement \u201427 percent Offer schools research-based curricula \u201423 percent Demonstrate that new teachers are competent \u201411 percent A look at the number of states in compliance with some of the Act's requirements include: Reading standards established\u201440 Math standards established\u201438Annual assessment in reading, language arts \u201430 Annual assessment in math\u201429Report cards \u201419 Highly qualified teacher definition \u201423 Subject-matter competence \u201411 Tests for new elementary teachers \u201443 Highly qualified teachers in every classroom \u20140 High-quality professional development \u20140 New Data on U.S. Children America 's children are less likely to commit a violent crime or become a victim of one, but more of them are living in poverty, according to a report by the Federal Interagency Forum onChild and Family Statistics. Additionally, the report states that the teen birth rate has declinedsteadily since 1991, hitting a record low in 2002. However, teenagers who gave birth are lesslikely to finish high school; and infants born to teenage mothers are more likely to be of lowbirth weight, increasing their chances for blindness, deafness, mental retardation, mental illness,and cerebral palsy. And the death rate has gone down for young people. However, children aremore likely to be overweight than they were before, and child poverty has inched up after severalyears of decline. Teachers' Salaries The typical public school teacher's salary barely kept pace with inflation in the 2002-2003 school year, according to the U.S. Department of Labor and the American Federation of Teachers. At$45,771, the average salary was up 3.3 percent from the previous year. The typical beginningteacher earned $29,564, up 3.2 percent. In the same period, health insurance premiums rose 13percent on average. Average teacher salaries by states include: FIVE HIGHEST:California - $55,693 Michigan - $54,020 Connecticut - $53,962 New Jersey - $53,872 D.C. - $53,194 FIVE LOWEST:South Dakota - $32,414 Oklahoma - $33,277 North Dakota - $33,869 Mississippi - $35,135 Montana - $35,754 Next-Generation Scientists The U.S. Department of Energy recently announced an initiative to promote \"science literacy\" and boost the number of American students interested in becoming scientists and engineers. Theprogram will award scholarships at national laboratories for math and science teachers. It alsowill require the 17 labs to host 1,000 fifth-graders and 1,000 eighth-graders for at least one dayeach year. The Department will also sponsor an annual science expo, \"science appreciate days\"and career days in which scientists will visit public schools. According to an international studycompleted in 1999, U.S. fourth-graders ranked among the world's best in math and science. Byeighth grade, they fell below the international average. By 12th, they trailed students in nearlyevery other industrialized country. Children and Memory Study Researchers reported recently that a five-year-old could beat most adults on a recognition memory test, at least under specific conditions, due to the fact that adults \"know too much.\" Thestudy conducted at the Center for Cognitive Science at Ohio State University showed 77 youngchildren and 71 college students pictures of cats, bears, and birds. The children were accurate 31percent of the time in identifying pictures of animals they had seen earlier, while the adults wereaccurate seven percent of the time. Researchers believe the reason for the difference is thatchildren used a form of reasoning called similarity-based induction which means that when theywere shown subsequent pictures, they looked carefully to see if the animal looked similar to theoriginal. Adults used category-based-induction\u2014once they determined what the animal picturewas, they paid no more attention. National CASA Evaluation Some of the findings include: Judges tend to assign CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) volunteers to the most difficult cases\u2014i.e., children who tend to have multiple risk factors, previous involvementin the child protection system, and to be at severe risk for future abuse. Children with CASA volunteers were in the system about as long as the non-CASA cases. CASA volunteers are \"highly effective\" at making recommendations to the courts. CASA volunteers are engaged in a variety of activities, but much of their time is spent incontact with the child. Children with CASA volunteers\u2014as well as the children's parents\u2014received moreservices such as health care or substance abuse treatment. Parents of CSA children ranked the volunteers positively on every measure, includingtheir helpfulness to the parents themselves. Vaccine Safety Two British studies appear to refute concerns that a mercury-based preservative in vaccines may increase the risk of autism. In fact, the studies found that the preservative thimerosal may have aprotective effect. One study followed nearly 13,000 children, and the other looked at more than107,000. Findings show reduced risk of behavioral and developmental problems in children whoget thimerosal-containing vaccines in infants. Office of National Drug Control Policy ONDCP announces the release of two new publications aimed at curbing substance abuse among students, including What You Need to Know About Starting A Student Drug Testing Program , which reviews the steps that parents and school administrators need to take when implementing astudent drug testing program, including the kinds of tests that can be utilized; and The Challengein Higher Education: Confronting and Reducing Substance Abuse on Campus , which gives higher education administrators a basic understanding of illegal drug use among the collegepopulation and how to create a drug-free environment. It also includes sidebars explaininginnovative programs at several universities and colleges.

The study finds, as in past years, U.S. students' readingperformance sits around the middle of a 27 nation pack, just five points higher than average;math performance is five points lower than average. U.S. students also rank below average inhigh school graduation rates and just about average in school \"engagement,\" or how much theyparticipate and feel a sense of belonging. But when asked what kind of job they expect to holdby the time they are 30, 80.5 percent of U.S. students said they would have a white collar, high-skilled job, far exceeding the average of 62.2 percent. U.S. girls had even higher expectations ofthemselves, with 85.8 percent expecting a top job by age 30. Among all nations, only students inMexico had higher expectations. Along with the U.S. and Mexico, the nations with the highestaspiring 15-year-olds include Canada, Greece, South Korea, and Portugal. Among students inRussia and Hong Kong, only 58.6 percent had the same high expectations. Poll Looks at Teens Teenagers are far more likely to seek out friends for help with ethical decisions than to ask a member of the clergy, a poll by Harris Interactive reports. Among teenagers polled, 83 percentsaid they would turn to friends for help in making such choices, followed by their parents (68percent), teachers (27 percent), the Internet (24 percent), and clergy (14 percent). The pollshowed that almost one-third of teenagers surveyed think they have to \"bend the rules tosucceed.\" Twenty percent gave that answer in a similar poll last year. The survey of 624 studentswas drawn from a larger Harris Interactive poll that was conducted via e-mail and weighteddemographically to represent the nation.

Household Victimization The percentage of U.S. households victimized by violent crime or thefts during 2003 remained at the lowest levels since the Bureau of Justice Statistics reintroduced this crime indicator in 1994.Victimization fell from 25 percent of all households in 1994 to 15 percent of all households in2003. \" Crime and the Nation's Households, 2003\" can be found at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cnh03.htm . Mentally Ill Juvenile Offenders Nearly 2,000 children awaiting mental health treatment are incarcerated on any given night in juvenile detention facilities across the U.S., where many attempt suicide or attack others,according to a report prepared for Congress. Problems include a failure by federal and stateofficials in social service, criminal justice, and educational agencies to communicate and agreeon how to treat any given child. In addition, the cost of treatment often prevents parents fromseeking services. The General Accounting Office found in 2001 that parents surrendered 12,700children to the government for Medicaid treatment because the families could not afford mentalhealth care on their own. The report surveyed 500 juvenile detention administrators in 49 states.It included about three-fourths of all facilities and covered the first half of 2003. More than1,900 juveniles were incarcerated on any night while waiting for mental health services. Two-thirds of the facilities reported that youths either attempted suicide or attacked others. NIC Mental Health Online The National Institute of Corrections (NIC) recently made new prison mental health guidelines available online, providing standards for procedures, planning, methods, budget development,monitoring, and evaluation.

Contents incorporate observations and recommendations from mental healthprofessionals and information gathered from written surveys, literature searches, and site visits.See www.nic.org . Suicide Surge A suicide takes place somewhere around the world every 40 seconds, or nearly one million a year, and the rate looks to surge over the next two decades, reports international health experts.Although men in their sixties\u2014retirement age\u2014are by far the most likely to die at their ownhands, the numbers among younger men between 15 and 19 are rising, largely because of theavailability of guns. Suicide accounts for 1.5 percent of the total cost of disease to world society,reports the U.N. World Health Organization. Former communist states\u2014 Lithuania, Estonia,Russia, Latvia, and Hungary\u2014had the highest rates. The next five were Sri Lanka, ex-SovietKazakhstan and Belarus, Slovenia, and Finland, according to figures for 2000.

(Edition). By Robert A. Shearer. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2005. 347 pp. (paper), $46.67. REVIEWED BY TODD JERMSTAD BELTON, TEXAS It seems so axiomatic that effective interviewing in the criminal justice context is the key to quality supervision and programming that it is surprising that this subject is often discounted orignored when discussing ways to improve the supervision of offenders or delivery of services.Perhaps because the topic of interviewing naturally entails examining the effectiveness of staff,thus shifting the focus from innovative programs, policy-makers, academicians, and practitionersin the field of criminal justice appear to overlook this essential component to deterring criminalbehavior and rehabilitating offenders. However, in Interviewing: Theories, Techniques, andPractices , Dr. Robert A. Shearer, a professor at the College of Criminal Justice, Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas rectifies this matter and draws attention to the need forcompetent interviewing in all facets of the criminal justice system. Several matters should be noted at the onset of this review. First, as Dr. Shearer explains, his book is about interviewing and not interrogation. Second, the title clearly reflects that the subjectmatter is not just effective interviewing techniques, but also the theoretical basis for applyingthese techniques, along with useful exercises for the reader to reinforce what has been presentedin the text. Finally, Dr. Shearer emphasizes that being a skillful interviewer is not an innate gift;one can gain a proficiency in interviewing through instruction and practice. Dr. Shearer observes that whereas interrogation is a predominantly one-way process and is highly controlled by the questioner, an interview is a conversation between two people with apurpose. Moreover, there are several purposes to interviewing. One is to gather information,another is to detect deception; however, Dr. Shearer further states that an additional purpose is toestablish trust between the parties. Finally, the author explains that he has written this bookmainly for the criminal justice professional who has not necessarily had any formal orspecialized training in the craft of interviewing but who encounters people as part of the person'sjob. Thus police officers, correctional officers, probation and parole officers, counselors andsocial workers will all greatly benefit from reading this book. This book consists of twelve chapters and a preface. The first three chapters introduce the reader to the basic concepts of interviewing in the criminal justice environment. Chapter four offers adetailed description of the model for interviewing that provides the basic framework for learningin this book. Then, chapters five through eleven focus on specific interviewing skills. Finally,chapter twelve draws together all of the skills and techniques discussed in the book and offersfurther insights on the future of interviewing. Each chapter ends with a summary, study questions, and assessments that enable the reader to perform a self-evaluation of his or her grasp of the concepts discussed in each chapter. It should be noted that the emphasis in this book is on verbal communication. Thus, while the author recognizes that certain nonverbal communication, such as body language, is important ingathering and evaluating communicated information, it is the information garnered through oralexchanges that will advance the objectives of the interview. Moreover, Dr. Shearer stresses thatthe varying degree of motivation that an offender has for revealing information and certaincultural, psychological, or environmental barriers may require the utilization of differenttechniques to elicit the needed information. Finally, this book propounds that the objective of anyinterview in the criminal justice setting is not just to gather and process information but also toinfluence the behavior or actions of the offender being interviewed. The late British poet Robert Graves once said, \"Before one can break the rules of grammar, he must first learn to master them.\" This statement, which was made to challenge aspiring avantgarde poets to first learn the basics of good writing, can be applied to any endeavor that requires the acquisition of certain skills, techniques, and knowledge. Effective interviewing is nodifferent. Although Dr. Shearer notes that there are any number of \"exotic\" interview techniques,ranging from hypnosis to nonverbal interviewing, nothing is more effective than learning thefundamentals of interviewing and applying the acquired skills and understanding in both aneducational setting and in actual practice. Dr. Robert Shearer has succeeded in not just makingthe goals and principles of effective interviewing clear and comprehensible but also showing thateffective interviewing is a competence that can be readily grasped by any diligent practitioner inthe field of criminal justice. back to top The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.

Published by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts www.uscourts.gov Publishing Information Volume 69 Number 1 Home REVIEWS OF PROFESSIONAL PERIODICALS The Prison Journal Crime and Delinquency The Prison Journal REVIEWED BY SAM TORRES\"The Electronic Monitoring of Offenders Released from Jail or Prison: Safety, Control, and Comparisons to the Incarceration Experience\" by Brian K. Payne and Randy R. Gainey (December 2004) House arrest with electronic monitoring (EM) was implemented in 1984 and has been used at various stages of the criminal justice process. Although some jurisdictions use electronicmonitoring at the pretrial stage, most employ it as a sanction to supervise and control offendersin the community after conviction. EM may be used as a sanction in and of itself, or along withother sanctions in cases where the offender may be required to serve a short custody sentence.When used with a period of imprisonment, EM is imposed as a special condition of probationupon release from custody. Payne and Gainey focus their research on this type of offender andconsider how they experience house arrest with electronic monitoring. A number of concerns immediately surfaced with the use of EM, such as the possible invasion of privacy, either by the government or by private agencies. Using technological advancements tocontrol and punish has been described by some as overly intrusive and barbaric. Other criticsstate that EM is not really an alternative to incarceration but simply a new type of sentencingalternative. Consistent with the principle of net widening, critics also claim that many offenderssentenced to electronic monitoring would in the past have been informally diverted. Anothercriticism of EM was that offenders remained in the community and could easily escape from thistype of supervision. Finally, critics claim that EM turns the home into a prison. This studyattempts to partially investigate this criticism by asking offenders whether their homes were\"prisonized\" during their participation on EM. Paine and Gainey's major finding was that offenders who spent part of their time in jail followed by EM experienced the sanction, for the most part, in a way that can be characterized ascontrolling and rehabilitative. The EM offenders did experience some problems, and certainly feltthe sanction was a controlling mechanism, but they generally preferred EM to imprisonment. The study presents three general policy recommendations. First, EM offenders, especially those released to EM following a period of confinement, should be clearly informed about what toexpect beforehand in order to minimize potential problems. Offenders must be told that thesanction is controlling and may take a toll on other resident family members. The potential forfamily problems is high if the offender and family members are not informed beforehand aboutthe possibility of discord. A second policy recommendation is that other groups should also be educated about this type of sanction. The general public, policymakers, and the media tend to have serious misconceptions regarding EM. Policymakers and the public tend to favor punitive approaches toward thehandling of criminals, and EM is generally perceived as a lenient, slap on the wrist punishment.However, most offenders experienced EM as far from lenient. Although the sanction is seen aspreferable to jail, as long as it is reserved for less serious, nonviolent offenders, there should belittle concern about public safety, and the public needs to know this. The final policy implication is that community-based sanctions can be effectively combined with other traditional sanctions. The authors conclude that the combination of sanctions meets thedemand of the public, which generally wants judges to incarcerate first, and then rehabilitate.When applied after incarceration, EM achieves the public's desire for punishment andrehabilitation. This study also has two major implications for correctional theory. First, comments from the offenders lend credence to assumptions underlying social control theory, which posits that crimeoccurs when individuals' bonds to society are weakened. The key to addressing crime is to assurethat offenders remain connected to the community such that they feel that they have too much tolose by violating their conditions. Thus, EM allows offenders to maintain family ties and\"connectedness.\" Offenders in this study seemed to realize that they had too much to lose byviolating their EM conditions, and they appreciated the opportunity to maintain family andemployment bonds. Some participants admitted that the controlling nature of EM helped to keepthem in line. A second finding with theoretical implications for self-control theory is that manyof the offenders in the study admitted that the sanction had taught them self-control. The authors were unable to determine whether offenders believed that EM turned the home into a prison. About half agreed that it does, and about half disagreed. This would seem to suggestthat EM affects offenders and their families differently. Future research on EM should examinethis question. In addition, future research, according to the authors, should broaden the waysuccess is operationalized. All too often researchers defined success exclusively in terms ofrecidivism; however, success might also be defined in terms of public support, offender'sresponse to EM, whether the sanction is humane, cost-effective, and how the sanction affectsothers. This study also attempts to demonstrate that offenders can serve as a source of information about the usefulness of the sanction, and the authors encourage others to explore how offenders in thecommunity experience their sanction. In this regard most offenders on EM agreed that it wouldbe easy to escape but that the potential consequences kept them from even contemplating thisoption. Offenders also recognized that they would get into significant trouble if they tampered with the monitoring equipment. The comments from offenders show that they see their ties with theirfamilies and jobs as being too important to risk. When discussing the severity of the EMsanction, offenders generally agreed that EM does in fact control their lives in much the sameway that incarceration controls inmates' lives. However, the loss of freedom is a relativeexperience, and the experience of this loss does vary from offender to offender. Clearly, thesanction is experienced both as a loss of freedom and as a punishment. When asked to comparethe sanction with their time in jail, most offenders saw EM in a positive light. The majority ofoffenders had spent at least some time in jail, and all of them preferred EM to jail. When questioned about why jail was worse than EM, offenders generally pointed to four different areas: differences in the amount of control, the ability to maintain family ties, the abilityto maintain employment, and the availability of time for reflection. While most offendersenjoyed the opportunity to be with their families, some commented that family problems arose asa result of the sanction. The primary purpose of the study is to demonstrate that offenders can serve as a major source of information about a sanction. In this respect it appears that EM, as perceived by offenders, achieves both punitive and rehabilitative objectives, and thus should satisfy the public's desires. Electronic monitoring does indeed provide a controlling mechanism that restricts the offender, while allowing him/her to maintain family ties and employment. Furthermore, the sanction iscost-effective and reintegrative, and there is some indication that EM helps maintain socialcontrol by strengthening the offender's bonds to the community and thus enhancing self-control.However like most community-based sanctions, EM must be assigned with care, and it shouldgenerally be restricted to non-violent offenders. The article succeeds in demonstrating thatoffenders' perceptions of particular sanctions are worthy of examination, and also succeedssecondarily in demonstrating that EM remains a viable alternative to incarceration. In order togarner increased support for EM, however, policymakers and the public must be informed of thepunitive and rehabilitative aspects of this cost-effective sanction. back to top Crime and Delinquency REVIEWED BY CHRISTINE J. SUTTON\"Criminalizing Attractions: Perceptions of Stalking and the Stalker ,\" by Patrick Kinkade, Ronald Burns, and Angel Ibarraza Fuentes (2004)In 1998, Rebecca Schaeffer, a young actress, was shot to death by an obsessed fan, outside of her apartment in California. Her murder drew national attention to the issue of criminal stalking. In 1990, California became the first state to enact anti-stalking laws. Within three years, 47 other states followed. In another three years, the federal judicial system also developed stalkinglegislation. Research authors Patrick Kinkade, Ronald Burns and Angel Ibarraza Fuentesconcurred with others that an adequate definition of stalking still needs to be established. In theirstudy, they set out to develop a better definition of the stalking problem from the public'sperspective. It was their premise that the definition of a stalking event may reflect an evaluator'ssubjective interpretation of the behavior and characteristics of both the victim and the offender,as well as the situational factors surrounding stalking-related incidents. A review of the findings of prior studies and literature by the authors found that more than one million females and more than 370,00 males are stalked annually. Other findings concludedstalkers most often use a telephone as the medium of communication and 48 percent of thestalkers sent unsolicited gifts to the victims. Findings disclosed stalkers admitted to waiting fortheir target of love in a variety of places; including outside of classrooms, schools, homes, orplaces of work. Taking photographs of the target person was another stalking characteristic.Lastly, stalkers often had a psychological disorder, more so than non-stalkers. The authors' research also found that a larger number of stalkers and their victims are engaged in a relationship prior to the stalking incident. This is different from the \"star stalkers,\" celebritiescaptured in the media. Stalking victims, on average, were 28 years older when the stalkingbegan. The stalkers are slightly older than most criminals at the onset of criminal activity.Stalkers typically are unemployed or underemployed men, while their victims are found acrossthe socioeconomic continuum. In 2003, the authors conducted a study of a medium-sized southwestern liberal arts university, comprised of 6,851 undergraduate students. The study sample consisted of 356 students, 33.7percent male and 65.7 percent female. The measurement instrument used was a set of questionnaires with 40 different scenarios. Each scenario was written to describe an ambiguous situation between two people that may or may notconstitute stalking in the respondent's mind. Each respondent was given only seven scenarios and asked to identify on a ten point scale how he/she believed the scenario actions were definitely stalking or not stalking. Respondents alsodescribed what it meant to be a crime victim and/or if they had personally experienced stalking.Two sets of analyses were conducted to determine if a particular variable would affect the student's perceptions. The first set focused on the variable manipulation within any givenscenario. The second tested for potential differences among respondent characteristics ordemographics in relation to their perceptions of stalking. The resulting analyses showed that stalking was most likely ascribed to situations where the accused had given gifts to the complainant, or where the accused had gathered personalinformation on the complainant. The interaction was more likely to be identified as stalking if theaccused and the complainant were perceived as members of a lower socioeconomic class, than ifthe pairing's socioeconomic class remained unidentified. The authors concluded that the resultsshowed an insignificance of personal factors in the interpretation of scenario events as stalking.Additionally, there were no differences in the perceptions of respondents who had been a victimof a crime from those who had not, or with regard to their gender, race, television-viewingpractices, or political or religious views. This was an unexpected finding. However, the authorsrecognized the limited applicability of the study's findings, as it was based solely on theperceptions of college students in one part of the country, rather than general public. The authors concluded that the study shed more light on understanding how behaviors are ascribed to stalking and how individuals are regarded as stalkers. It also confirmed the findingsof Tijaden and Thoennes in 1998 that stalking should be treated as a significant societal problem,which is increasing in frequency, as well as the impact and influence of the criminal labelingprocess. Despite their initial premise that a clearer definition could be developed, their finalconclusion was that stalking is a complex crime that cannot easily be defined. back to top The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.

Cited with permission. 5 The Michigan restrictions were challenged in court as unconstitutional because they violated the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due process, the First Amendment's guarantee of freeassociation, and the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. TheSupreme Court upheld the regulations, finding that the restrictions \"bear a rational relation to the[department of correction's] valid interests in maintaining internal security and protecting childvisitors from exposure to sexual or other misconduct or from accidental injury.... To reduce thenumber of child visitors, a line must be drawn, and the categories set out by these regulations arereasonable\" (Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 94 [2003]). 6 The definition of who can visit or take children to visit is an even bigger problem in light of cultural traditions, i.e., the extended family network and fictive kin arrangements that exist inmany African-American families. Family duties and responsibilities are shared among a group of individuals; e.g., a young uncle may be expected to take on the father's role and do things such as take the child to a game or on a prison visit while the grand-mother provides day-to-day care and an aunt with a \"good\" job provides financial subsidies. Apparently this perspective waseither not presented or ignored as unimportant in the Michigan case (Personal communicationwith Creasie Finney Hairston, January 6, 2004). 7 Missouri has announced that its next contract with prison telephone systems will not include a commission for the state. The Ohio prison system entered into a contract that will reduce thecost of prison phone calls by 15 percent. California will reduce most prisoner phone calls by 25percent. In 2001, the Georgia Public Service Commission ordered telephone providers to reducethe rates for prisoner calls from a $3.95 connection fee and a rate of $0.69 per minute to a $2.20connection fee and a rate of $0.35 per minute. The new telephone contract for the PennsylvaniaDepartment of Corrections will reduce the average cost of a 15-minute telephone call by 30percent. And litigation has been initiated in a number of states\u2014including Illinois, Indiana,Kentucky, Ohio, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, South Dakota, Washing-ton,Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia\u2014to reduce the cost of prison phone calls and kick-backs to the state (eTc Campaign 2003). 8 The Children of Offenders study and the Jailed Mothers study both had small sample sizes and were not randomized, making it difficult to conclude a causal link between parentalincarceration and children's involvement in the criminal justice system. In the Children ofOffenders study (Johnston 1992, 1993), the sample ( 56, 202) target-ed children of offenders who already demonstrated disciplinary problems in school or delinquent behaviors,presenting the highest likelihood of second-generation incarceration ( Johnston 1995). In theJailed Mothers study, Johnston (1991) relied on self-reported data from the surveys of 100 jailedmothers on their children's living arrangements, risk factors, and problem behaviors. 9 The report indicates that \"generally, persons with fewer economic, tangible, social, physical and other personal resources may be more vulnerable to the threat of violence or abuse posed byan intimate partner.\" 10 This figure represents both pre-prison and during-prison nonpayment. Depending on the law of the state, prisoners may continue to accrue child supports arrears while incarcerated.According to Thoennes (2003), Massachusetts prisoners accrued on average $5,000 in arrearswhile behind bars. 11 The study defined \"family member\" as \"a blood or legal relative, someone with whom the prisoner has a child in common, or a significant other or guardian our respondent lived with priorto his or her incarceration or plans to live with after he or she is released from prison\" (Visher etal. 2004, 31). 12 See chapter 10 of the book this selection is taken from, But They All Come Back: Facing the Challenges of Prisoner Reentry , for a discussion of the concept of concentric circles of support. back to top References The articles and reviews that appear in Federal Probation express the points of view of the persons who wrote them and not necessarily the points of view of the agencies and organizations with which these persons are affiliated.
