[ AP: Facebook Froze As Anti-Vaccine Comments Swarmed Users ](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-technology-business-health-media-d79bb2210be0c2c5cbb81a6a887d4aed) In March, as claims about the dangers and ineffectiveness of coronavirus vaccines spun across social media and undermined attempts to stop the spread of the virus, some Facebook employees thought they had found a way to help. By subtly altering how posts about vaccines are ranked in people's newsfeeds, researchers at the company realized they could curtail the misleading information individuals saw about COVID-19 vaccines and offer users posts from legitimate sources like the World Health Organization. \"Given these results, I'm assuming we're hoping to launch ASAP,\" one Facebook employee wrote in March, responding to the internal memo about the study. Instead, Facebook shelved some suggestions from the study. Other changes weren't made until April.

Its Own Research Shows Otherwise ](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/10/25/facebook-papers-whistleblower-hate-speech-black-americans-trump-floyd/6156418001/) Even as civil rights leaders and the Black community registered complaint after complaint about Facebook, internal documents reviewed by USA TODAY show that the company continued to combat a relentless wave of racially motivated hate speech with automated moderation tools that are not sophisticated enough to catch most harmful content and are prone to making mistakes. One Facebook employee estimated that 1 out of every 1,000 pieces of content on the platform are hate speech. With all of the company's enforcement efforts combined, less than 5% of all the hate speech posted to Facebook is deleted, the person said. (Guynn, 10/25) [ AP: People Or Profit? Facebook Papers Show Deep Conflict Within ](https://apnews.com/article/the-facebook-papers-whistleblower-misinfo-trafficking-64f11ccae637cdfb7a89e049c5095dca) Facebook the company is losing control of Facebook the product \u2014 not to mention the last shreds of its carefully crafted, decade-old image as a benevolent company just wanting to connect the world. Thousands of pages of internal documents provided to Congress by a former employee depict an internally conflicted company where data on the harms it causes is abundant, but solutions, much less the will to act on them, are halting at best. The crisis exposed by the documents shows how Facebook, despite its regularly avowed good intentions, appears to have slow-walked or sidelined efforts to address real harms the social network has magnified and sometimes created. They reveal numerous instances where researchers and rank-and-file workers uncovered deep-seated problems that the company then overlooked or ignored.

Researchers also found that adolescents who say they vaped cannabis within the last 30 days increased 7-fold \u2014 from 1.6% to 8.4% \u2014 during the same period. The report was published in JAMA Pediatrics on Monday by researchers who analyzed 17 studies involving nearly 200,000 adolescents in the U.S. and Canada. Overall, they say, the cumulative data points to what may be a shift in preference from dried herb to cannabis oil products, which is how marijuana is ingested via vaping.

So far 20 people have been sickened in 8 states, including 3 who needed hospitalization. No deaths have been reported. Patients range in age from 2 to 75 years, with a median age of 11. Eight of nine people interviewed by the CDC as part of the outbreak investigation said they ate Citterio brand Premium Italian-Style Salame Sticks, which are sold at Trader Joe's and other grocery stores.
