Whether you're looking for a particular treatment or just a simple day of indulgence, we've selected the very best spas in London. Aire Ancient Baths, Covent Garden Best spa in London for: A totally unique and social experience It's rare for something at once so seemingly historic and so fresh to open up right at the heart of London, a city renowned\u2014like its people\u2014for having seen and tried everything at least once in its long and fabled lifetime. But candlelit, sultry baths inspired by Greco-Roman [spa](https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/top-destination-spa-resorts-in-the-world-readers-choice-awards) traditions, located in the basement of a 17th-century building (incidentally the former home of Peter Pan creator JM Barrie) just off The Strand is new even for this old dame. With outposts everywhere from [New York](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/best-new-restaurants-in-midtown-nyc) and [Chicago](https://www.cntraveler.com/destinations/chicago) to [Barcelona](https://www.cntraveler.com/destinations/barcelona) and [Copenhagen](https://www.cntraveler.com/destinations/copenhagen), Aire turned on the taps in London in June 2021. At this first British destination there are five baths, each the size of a small pool, to wander between in a robe at your leisure: the warm, 36\u00baC Tepidarium, the huge bubbling Balneum, the Vaporium (a steam room with aromatherapy), the Red Sea-esque saltwater bath known as the Flotarium, and the not-for-the-faint-at-heart Frigidarium (a cold bath of 14\u00baC and ice bath of 10\u00baC). There is also the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: a heart-shaped tub filled with alcohol-free Spanish Ribero del Duero red known as the 'wine to wallow in post-massage. Look past any 'faux distressed' details and the fact it isn't truly, truly 'old' in the typical London sense\u2014Aire Ancient Baths offers a wonderfully fun and relaxing new experience in the capital, for both locals and tourists alike. Treatment to book: The Relaxing Massage 30 package includes as many dips as you can handle and, as the name suggests, a 30-minute almond oil, just-firm-enough massage in a separate low-lit room upstairs (reached via a low-lit lift), followed by herbal tea sipped while reclining on warm marble stone. It will leave you feeling as fresh and sleepy as a baby after bathtime. Don't plan to go raving afterwards. Insider tip: Book a late-afternoon or evening visit and head into one of the many Covent Garden restaurants nearby offering a pre-theater menu beforehand, for excellent food at a fraction of the regular price. \u2014Becky Lucas "}
