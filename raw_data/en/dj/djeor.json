Rose can be used for relaxation or as an antidepressant. Frankincense is uplifting and can also be utilized as a disinfectant. \"The use of essential oils as an alternative or supplemental medical treatment is one of the fastest growing modalities in the country because people are tired of drugs,\" said Linda Chollar, a holistic health practitioner who spoke recently to a group of faculty, staff and community members at the USC Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center. Chollar was on hand to discuss the benefits of aromatherapy for adult caregivers. Aromatherapy uses essential oils that have been distilled from plant roots, seeds, blossoms, flowers, bark and peels to help relieve emotional and physical ailments. In concentrated form, the herbal effect of essential oils can be 100 times stronger than the original plant. \"I use aromatherapy with 75 percent of my patients,\" said Chollar, who consults with individual clients and also lectures health-care professionals on alternative medicine at Torrance Memorial Medical Center. The most common means of administering essential oils is through inhalation, she explained. The oils trigger the olfactory nerves, which are directly connected to the brain's limbic system. This part of the central nervous system is responsible for controlling reactions, breathing and emotions. Other forms of application include adding oils to bath water, rubbing them into the skin and direct massage. She does not recommend taking them internally although the practice is quite common in other countries. \"I approach using essential oils like any medication,\" she said. \"Individuals differ based upon levels of strength, skin type and age.\" The use of essential oils goes back thousands of years. The Virgin Mary, known as the \"Queen of Essential Oils,\" is often depicted holding an alabaster jar in religious portraits. Today, businesses throughout the world seek their soothing effects. According to Chollar, the Bank of Japan diffuses lemon oil throughout its offices because it is said to help the workers stay focused and alert. In some parts of Europe, too, a trip to the aromatherapist is as normal as a trip to the pharmacist. It is estimated that by the year 2010, one trillion dollars will be spent annually on alternative health care. This will boost demand for essential oils, which are inherently expensive due to high distillation costs and the rarity of certain herbs. For example, it takes 60,000 roses to make one ounce of rose oil that can cost up to $150. Still, she said, for many the benefits outweigh the costs. Some of those advantages were reinforced by those present at the discussion. \"I use it to prevent illnesses and to relax,\" said Genoveva Isabelle Estrella, a registered dental hygienist at the Oral Health Center. \"It helps for meditation and for pleasant dreams. I also use it for headaches and stomachaches.\" Zoltan A. Tokes, professor of biochemistry and molecular biology, also attended the lecture to learn more about the benefits of aromatherapy. \"We all use aromatherapy, but we just don't call it by name,\" Tokes said. \"Don't you smell your small cup of coffee in the morning or sage in the air when you're out on a hike? When you cook, you use bay leaves. Aromatherapy was a part of life even before we "}
