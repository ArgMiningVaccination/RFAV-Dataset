Causes Encephalitis is a rare condition. It occurs more often in the first year of life and decreases with age. The very young and older adults are more likely to have a severe case. Encephalitis is most often caused by a virus. Many types of viruses may cause it. Exposure can occur through: Different viruses occur in different geographic locations. Many cases occur during a certain season. Encephalitis caused by the herpes simplex virus is the leading cause of more severe cases in all ages, including newborns. Routine vaccination has greatly reduced encephalitis due to some viruses, including: Other viruses that cause encephalitis include: After the virus enters the body, the brain tissue swells. This swelling may destroy nerve cells, and cause bleeding in the brain and brain damage. Other causes of encephalitis may include: Symptoms Some people may have symptoms of a cold or stomach infection before encephalitis symptoms begin. When this infection is not very severe, the symptoms may be similar to those of other illnesses: Other symptoms include: Symptoms in newborns and younger infants may not be as easy to recognize: Emergency symptoms: - Loss of consciousness, poor responsiveness, stupor, coma - Muscle weakness or paralysis [Seizures](/adam/1/003200) - Severe headache - Sudden change in mental functions, such as flat mood, impaired judgment, memory loss, or a lack of interest in daily activities Exams and Tests The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about symptoms. Tests that may be done include: [Brain MRI](/adam/1/003791) [CT tomography (SPECT) - Culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, or urine (however, this test is rarely useful) - Electroencephalogram ( [EEG](/adam/1/003931)) [Lumbar puncture](/adam/1/003428) and [CSF examination](/adam/1/003369) - Tests that detect antibodies to a virus (serology tests) - Test that detects tiny amounts of virus DNA (polymerase chain reaction -- PCR) Treatment The goals of treatment are to provide supportive care (rest, nutrition, fluids) to help the body fight the infection, and to relieve symptoms. Medicines may include: - Antiviral medicines, if a virus caused the infection - Antibiotics, if bacteria are the cause - Antiseizure medicines to prevent seizures - Steroids to reduce brain swelling - Sedatives for irritability or restlessness - Acetaminophen for fever and headache If brain function is severely affected, physical therapy and speech therapy may be needed after the infection is controlled. Outlook (Prognosis) The outcome varies. Some cases are mild and short, and the person fully recovers. Other cases are severe, and permanent problems or death is possible. The [acute](/adam/1/002215) phase normally lasts for 1 to 2 weeks. Fever and symptoms gradually or suddenly disappear. Some people may take several months to fully recover. Possible Complications Permanent brain damage may occur in severe cases of encephalitis. It can affect: Hearing Memory Muscle control Sensation Speech Vision When to Contact a Medical Professional Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have: Prevention Children and adults should avoid contact with anyone who has encephalitis. Controlling mosquitoes (a mosquito bite can transmit some viruses) may reduce the chance of some infections that can lead to encephalitis. Apply an insect repellant containing the chemical, DEET when you go outside (but DO NOT use DEET products on infants younger than 2 months). Remove any sources of standing water (such as old tires, cans, gutters, and wading pools). Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants when outside, especially at dusk. Children and adults should get routine vaccinations for viruses that can cause encephalitis. People should receive specific vaccines if they are traveling to places such as parts of Asia, where Japanese encephalitis is found. Vaccinate animals to prevent encephalitis caused by the rabies virus. References Beckham JD, Tyler KL. Encephalitis. In: Bennett eds.
