Intravenous injections are difficult and have some type of risk and are costly whereas subcutaneous injections are easy, safe and cheap to do for small amounts of drugs. Medications given by doctors using subcutaneous injection methods are for those drugs which have less volumes. Like 1ml or 2 ml some given like this are insulin and some other body hormone given from outside. Sometimes there are emergencies to give drugs to muscles or skin.

It can also be given intramuscularly but subcutaneously is preferred. Location to inject is necessary to know. This injection is given under the skin in fatty tissue, there are some locations where it is accessible to fatty tissue. This type of location is needed so that needles should not touch muscles, bone or blood vessels. Abdomen- below the belly button there is fatty skin where we can inject. Arm: shoulder below hands have fatty tissue. Thigh: thighs have a high number of fatty tissues. Equipment used for subcutaneous injections includes: Medication: Vials of liquid and liquid made from powered and sterile water are used for medications.

The current guidelines suggest to take primary vaccination like bcg/ easysix/pentavac/ mmr on priority basis on time Precaution to b taken is to inform prior to visiting hospital n avoid crowding. Booster vaccination can b delayed There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. However, as a reminder, cdc always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, including: avoid close contact with people who are sick. Human beings can be shielded from many [infectious diseases](https://www.lybrate.com/lab-test/infectious-diseases/health-feed). One of the ways to do this is by getting the disease and then producing [antibodies](https://www.lybrate.com/lab-test/torch-screen-antibodies/health-feed) against it so that future attacks do not happen. The second way is to have the bacteria introduced into the system so that the antibodies are produced and the [infection](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/infection) does not take place. The first method is called active immunisation and the second is known as passive immunisation, and both are effective against different organisms. When a baby is born, passive immunisation is chosen to provide protection against a number of diseases. In fact, the doctor will give you a list of shots that the child should be given and when. Immunisation is necessary for the following reasons: So, go ahead and protect your child against various diseases so that he/she can lead a healthy, happy, disease-free life. Influenza is more commonly known as the [flu](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/flu). It is an [infection](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/infection) that affects the respiratory system and is caused by the influenza virus. This injection is recommended for kids who are under the age of 6 months. It ensures that the baby is safeguarded from the virus during an influenza outbreak. Since the nature of virus changes year on year, the immunity doesn't last for more than 1 year. This [vaccination](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/vaccination) is ideally taken during the month of October and November. The effect of the vaccination typically lasts for 6-8 months. Ideally, kids who have never had a flu vaccination should take 2 vaccinations within 4 weeks. Kids who have received a shot of flu should undertake this vaccination once in a year. This arrangement is ideal for up to 9 years of age. Flu shot is extremely important for a kid due to the following reasons: Flu shot should not be taken if: 1. A baby is under the age of 6 months. 2. The baby has thimerosal [allergy](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/allergy). Is flu shot safe? The flu shot is considered to be very safe. It does not result in the flu. Few side effects include: a. Soreness of the place where the needle is injected. This doesn't last for more than a couple of day. b. [Body ache](https://www.lybrate.com/treatment-for-body-ache) and mild [fever](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/fever) for the first couple of days after the vaccination are done. c. There is little to no pain in the place where the injection is injected by the doctor. What is nasal flu vaccine? This is an influenza dose that is not injected into the body, but given in the form of the nasal spray. Healthy kids above the age of 2 years are fit to get this injection. For those kids who have a history of [chronic illness](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/chronic-illness) should check with their doctor to go ahead with the nasal spray. Each dose is given in each nostril. Like the influenza vaccine, nasal flu vaccine should be undertaken once for those who have already taken this dose once. Kids who have not undergone this vaccination are eligible for 2 dosages each 4 weeks apart from each other. Some forms of [cancer](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/cancer) such as [cervical cancer](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/cervical-cancer) can be prevented by vaccines. Cervical cancer is the second most common form of cancer that affects women. The vaccine that prevents cervical cancer is known as the human papilloma virus( [HPV](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/hpv)) [vaccination](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/vaccination). Let's take a look at a few things you should know about this vaccination. What is HPV? There are over a hundred types of HPV. While some of them affect the genital area and can cause abnormal tissue growth that leads to cervical cancer others can cause anal cancer, [genital warts](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/genital-warts), skin [warts](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/warts), cancer of the head and neck and vaginal cancer. When should you have the vaccination? The human papilloma virus or [HPV vaccination](https://www.lybrate.com/doctors-for-hpv-vaccination) is most effective when administered to preteen and teenage girls. This vaccine protects them for the next ten years against the disease. One of the reasons, the HPV vaccination is given so early is that the virus can be spread easily by sexual activity. Having the vaccination early can protect them from a HPV [infection](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/infection). The vaccine is also said to be more effective when given to girls who have not yet been infected by a strain of HPV. How is the vaccination given? The HPV vaccination is given in the form of three injections spread over six months. The second dose is given two months after the first dose and the final dose is administered six months after the first dose. There is more than one name for the HPV vaccination. [Gardasil](https://www.lybrate.com/medicine/gardasil-vaccine/health-feed) and [cervarix](https://www.lybrate.com/medicine/cervarix-vaccine/health-feed) are the most common amongst these. Many doctors suggest no matter which one you choose, the same vaccination be used for all three doses. How effective is the vaccination? Along with protecting against cervical cancer, the HPV vaccine also protects women against vaginal, anal and oropharynx cancer. Some of the vaccines also protect against genital warts. However, the vaccination cannot be used to treat existing HPV infections and is less effective when given to women who have already been infected with a strain of the virus. Is there anyone who should not have this vaccine? The HPV vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women. Do not have the vaccination if you are already suffering from a severe illness. The vaccination is also not recommended for women who are allergic to yeast or latex. What are the side effects of the HPV vaccination? The HPV vaccination has minor side effects that may include mild soreness at the injection site, a headache or low [fever](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/fever). Some women may also feel dizzy or faint after the injection. [Nausea](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/nausea), [vomiting](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/vomiting), diarrhea and [abdominal pain](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/abdominal-pain) are some of the other side effects associated with this vaccination. When it comes to sexually transmitted diseases or STDs, there is no doubt that prevention is better than cure. Contrary to popular belief, STDs do not spread only through intercourse. STDs can also spread by skin to skin contact. The easiest way to prevent STDs is by abstaining from sex or being in a monogamous relationship with an uninfected person. This may not be possible for many men. Hence, let's take a look at alternatives to prevent sexual diseases. 1. Get tested - Most STDs can be easily tested for and treated. Thus, it is a good idea to regularly get yourself tested if you have more than one sexual partner. Your partner should ideally also get tested for STDs. However, remember that herpes and human papillomavirus do not show up on STD tests. 2. Avoid sex under the influence of alcohol or drugs - When inebriated, you may not make the best decisions. Decisions made at this stage are usually rash and not thought out. Thus, you may forget to ask the other person if she has been tested for STDs. 3. Vaccinations - Vaccinations can be effective against some types of STDs. The [HPV](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/hpv) vaccine can be given to boys as young as 11 years until they turn 26. Other vaccines that protect men from STDs are [Hepatitis A](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/hepatitis-a) and [hepatitis B](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/hepatitis-b) vaccinations. 4. Use condoms - Condoms are the only way to protect yourself against the transference of STDs during intercourse. A condom should be used even if the woman is using an alternate form of birth control. Never reuse a condom and do not use oil-based lubricants with a condom. Before using a condom always check to ensure the condom is not punctured in any way and that it is within the expiry period. A condom should be used for oral, vaginal and anal sex. However, this does not prevent the transmission of STDs like [syphilis](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/syphilis), herpes and HPV. 5. Communicate with your partner - It is a good idea to share your sexual history with your partner. This creates an environment where you can discuss getting tested for STDs before engaging in intercourse. You must reach an explicit agreement about what forms of intercourse both of you are comfortable with. It is also a good idea to discuss a possible monogamous relationship with your partner. 6. [Circumcision](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/circumcision) - Male circumcision is said to reduce a man's risk of contracting STDs like [HIV](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/h-i-v), [genital herpes](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/genital-herpes) and genital HPV. Vacations are a brilliant escape from our hectic schedule when we can enjoy our time with our close ones. But vacations also calls for one thing and that is fitness. Yes! Without the right fitness and physical stature, you will not be able to enjoy your vacation and fall ill. When we are in the \"vacation mood\" it is very often seen that people follow a dietary routine that is absolutely not what they follow at home. Due to the different food and schedule, the [diet](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/healthy-diet) tends to change. So here are some healthy eating options that you will be of great help when on vacations. 1. Plan a diet - We know it is difficult to follow a particular diet plan when you are on a vacation. But that is what causes health problems later on. Plan a diet of at least the timings of the meal you have and include some common items which you also eat at home into these meals. Getting a common item to eat helps a lot and does not cause a complete imbalance to the diet. 2. Pack healthy food - When you are on a vacation you would not want to face a stomach upset, right? So it is important that you pack healthy food like fresh fruits, dry nuts, ready-made energy bars, etc. These are really good for your body and also keeps the proper balance in the minerals inside your system. 3. Think and indulge - Since you are on a vacation you will get the opportunity to grab a bite of various food items which you would avoid if you were at home. So always think twice before indulging into different food items that may not be a very healthy choice to make. However, a bite once a while will not do you any harm! 4. Rely on water always - Water is your best friend when you are travelling for a vacation. A sip of water constantly will keep your body hydrated and allow it to function properly. Make sure you have purified water from a safe tank or filter. You can also mix some energy powder into it to prevent the energy salts to remain in your body. Many people also eat fruits along with water for energy and filling appetite. 5. Choose vegetarian food - You can always enjoy a nice plate of your favourite [meat](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/meat-benefits-and-side-effects) cooked for you but you must keep in mind that meat is particularly heavy on the stomach. So you will need to follow a proper diet plan to compensate the heavy meal you took and that seems to be a bit difficult on a vacation, isn't it? Therefore, try to eat vegetables and veg items on the menu as much as you can because they are light and fresh as well. So here are the different kinds of healthy eating options that you can choose to follow when you are on a vacation. "}
