But what exactly does \"non-toxic\" mean when it comes to our candles? At our company, non-toxic means that our candles are made from high-quality, natural ingredients that are safe for both people and the environment. We carefully choose our wax, wicks, and fragrances to ensure that they are free from harmful chemicals, such as lead, phthalates, and parabens, which are commonly found in traditional candles. We use soy wax made in the united states to reduce our CO2 output. Our fragrances are made from a blend essential oils and synthetics to provide the natural fragrance while also being sustainable. We prioritize sustainable and eco-friendly practices in our manufacturing processes to the best of our ability. We also minimize waste and reduce our carbon footprint by using recyclable materials and continuously innovating on ways to reduce our energy consumption. In addition to being non-toxic, our candles are vegan-friendly. We believe in creating products that align with our values and making a positive impact on the world. Many suppliers of scents sell what is available or create something just for their brand. There are very few that have put the work into meeting the strict safety standards that our fragrance partner has met. All of the fragrances we use do not contain - Phthalates - Carcinogens - Reproductive Toxins - Organ Toxins - Acute Toxins Many fragrances contain chemicals that can cause migraines or trigger asthma which is why non-toxic is so important to us. While we cannot guarantee that people who are scent sensitive will not be triggered by the fragrances, we've been able to provide candles to people who haven't been able to buy a candle for themselves in years because of their own symptoms.
