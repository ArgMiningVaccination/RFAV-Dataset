Everyone has a nervous system and you probably know it is important but that might be the extent of what you know about it. Your nervous system is comprised of nerves that send signals to your cells, glands, and muscles throughout your body and controls most functions of your body including your movements, thoughts, memory, breathing, sleep, bodily healing, brain function, five senses, mental health, digestion, heartbeat, stress response, and even puberty. Needless to say, optimizing your nervous system health is very important for living a healthy life. When your nervous system is compromised in some way, there can be a cascade of effects throughout your body, even if the injury or problem is localized. What Impacts Your Nervous System Health? Your nervous system health can be impacted by things like disease, injury, stroke, substance abuse, nerve damage, and more. It also tends to decline as we age. Common symptoms of nervous system disorders or problems include headaches, tingling sensations, loss of feeling, weakness, double vision or other vision problems, memory loss, lack of coordination, impaired mental ability, mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, and more.
