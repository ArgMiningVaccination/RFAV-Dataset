Henderson CSM Julio Alvarez SRU Commander SRU Command Sergeant Major Our Mission The Fort Carson Soldier Recovery Unit (SRU) enhances the readiness of the 4ID/Fort Carson Team by providing mission command, primary care, and case management for Soldiers in Recovery to establish conditions for healing and promote the timely transition back to the force or civilian life. About At the Soldier Recovery Unit (formerly the Warrior Transition Battalion or WTB) we take care of our nation's ill, injured, and wounded Soldiers by providing them with outstanding medical care, advocacy, and leadership. Our goal is to successfully transition the Army's most seriously ill and injured Soldiers back to the force and/or to Veteran status through a comprehensive program of medical care, rehabilitation, professional development, and achievement of personal goals. To be successful in this mission, we implemented the triad of care concept, ensuring that each Soldier's nurse case manager, primary care manager (medical provider) and squad leader meet and communicate on an official basis to ensure the best possible transition. We also work with each Soldier to establish comprehensive transition plans, allowing them to create their own transition goals resourced by the SRU. Our innovative programs and comprehensive care continue to evolve to meet the physical, emotional, and intellectual health needs of our Soldiers of all components, whether they are active duty, Army National Guard or Army Reserve Soldiers. Our SRU staff is a diverse team of medical experts, social workers, leadership, and more who work together to create a holistic healing environment for Soldiers. Entry Criteria Eligible for SRU Entry: - Soldier has a profile with an expected duration of 6 months or more OR - Soldier has duty limitations that prevent the Soldier from contributing to their Unit's mission AND - The complexity of the Soldier's condition requires complex OR high-risk clinical case management Ineligible for SRU Entry: - Soldiers already in IDES (Exception to Policy possible on a case-by-case basis) - Soldiers with a non-transferrable flag or pending UCMJ Company leadership must submit an entry packet to the SRU for approval by the Triad of Leadership (TOL). The TOL decides which Soldiers meet entry criteria to enter the SRU by reviewing the \"TOL Packet\" submitted by Company leadership. Life in the SRU All Soldiers assigned to the SRU attend medical appointments, participate in the Adaptive Reconditioning Program, and take an active role in the Comprehensive Recovery Plan (CRP). Once a Soldier reaches their Medical Retention Determination Point (MRDP), the Soldier's status is updated to either Return to Duty or Veteran Track. Return to Duty Soldiers focus on participating in Physical Training and retraining/re-certifying their MOS skills. Veteran Track Soldiers focus on a successful transition to veteran status. These Soldiers participate in the Career and Education Readiness Program, which consists of civilian education, internships, resume building, apprenticeships, and other job opportunities.
