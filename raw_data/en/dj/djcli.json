Prior to joining ABC, Dr. Gafner was director of research and product development for Tom's of Maine. It's a question currently being applied to chemical compounds, formally known as phytochemicals, that have historically been made exclusively by plants, but are now-through recent advancements in genetic engineering\u2014being manufactured by genetically modified yeasts, or protozoans like euglena. A host of widely used vitamins, amino acids, sweeteners, essential oils, and bioactive phytochemicals are being produced at industrial scale, not by plants grown in fields, but by giant vats of microorganisms genetically altered to crank out useful compounds that they would not naturally be able to synthesize. This branch of synthetic biology is already revolutionizing the market for food, beverage, and dietary supplement ingredients. There are dozens of \"SynBio\" versions of common ingredients already on the market, including astaxanthin, resveratrol, carotenoids, cannabinoids, even omega-3 fatty acids. The use of genetically modified organisms to do the work of plants is driven by the fact that growing and processing medicinal plants can be expensive and labor-intensive. So, chemists and biologists looked for cheaper alternatives. Are these microorganism-derived compounds truly equivalent to their plant-derived counterparts? As a chemist, my answer is, yes. From a purely biochemical perspective, they are the same and I can prove that in my lab. As a human who cares about more than single chemical constituents or the advances of science, my answer is, no. Not really. I do not see them as equivalent, and I will tell you why. Complexity is Key Growing up as the son of an herbalist, one of my first jobs was to grind up dried roots and leaves into powders and combine them individually with concentrated alcohol prior to their later extract with hydraulic presses into tinctures. We then combined those tinctures to make a final tincture. The final formulas were admixtures of 6-8 botanicals containing hundreds of phytochemicals of desire. It was the complexity of those combinations that made the formulas what they were. This was, and still remains, the Eastern medicine way. All of those diverse bioactive compounds, with their characteristic bitter tastes, are secondary plant metabolites that through centuries of Zoopharmacognosy (watching how animals eat and self-medicate) have become part of our human lives. At some point in history, someone wanted to \"improve\" the multi-ingredient botanical medicines that we humans have made for millennia, and decided to try and isolate pure phytochemicals. Written history tells us that this began in 1805, with German scientist, Friedrich Sert\u00fcrner, who isolated morphine from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum). That became the first \"active principal\" to be purified from a plant source. Simply put, morphine seemed to work much better, and the dosing was more controllable than with the combustion and inhalation of poppy resin. The Race to Isolate So began the race to identify, extract, and purify single bioactive compounds from plants. It's been the underlying driver of the pharmaceutical industry for the last two centuries, and it has yielded important advances. This mindset is increasingly prevalent in today's dietary supplement industry. Over the years, some in the industry have taken a liking to this single compound model. Many raw materials suppliers are extracting, isolating, and marketing purified phytochemicals to supplement makers. They do this proudly and unapologetically, trying to be the newer, more refined versions of traditionally used herbs, complete with clinical studies backing up functional claims. Ringing a big pharma bell yet? Chemically, SynBio ingredients are equivalent to their plant-derived counterparts. But there's more to an herbal medicine than the chemicals it contains. In the economically-driven rush toward SynBio, I hope we do not lose sight of that. Along the way, the phrase 'alternative medicine' was coined to describe the old ways of doing things, including the age-old methods of preparing herbal tinctures. But really, it is these new methods\u2014the isolation of single phytochemicals\u2014that is the \"alternative.\" And there are downsides to our over-reliance on isolated, purified compounds, as even a cursory look at the astonishing rates of serious drug-related adverse events will show. New Page in Old Story The use of genetically modified organisms to do the work of plants is simply the latest chapter of this story. It is driven by the fact that growing and processing medicinal plants can be expensive and labor-intensive. So, chemists and biologists looked for cheaper alternatives. Without going into great detail on the pros and cons of basic GMO technology, it is important to understand that the arguments in favor of GMOs are largely economic. Genetic alteration makes plants (and animals) bigger, better, faster, and more resistant to the challenges of farming today whether that be extreme weather from climate change or pests. And the arguments against GMOs basically boil down to the hard truth that we simply don't know what these organisms will do in the long term\u2014how they will mutate over time, how they will impact wild type organisms, and how they will reshape ecosystems. Like \"Killer Bees', there is concern that these new genetically modified organisms, plants or animals will breed and forever change the plant and animal kingdom. There's also the specter of unanticipated health issues down the long road. GMO, or Not? According to official and widely used industry definitions, plant compounds produced by genetically altered yeasts or euglena cells, are not considered \"GMO\" ingredients because those organisms do not end up in the product that goes to market. But the reality is, chemists are making minor changes to the genomes of these organisms, engineering them so they will produce secondary metabolites once found only in plants. The pros and cons of this method are more or less the same as the GMO arguments because this method is a child of GMO technology. Along the way, the phrase 'alternative medicine' was coined to describe the old ways of doing things, including the age-old methods of preparing herbal tinctures. But really, it is these new methods\u2014the isolation of single phytochemicals\u2014that is the \"alternative.\" Again, the arguments in favor of SynBio are mostly economic: with SynBio, we can produce tons of chemicals, formerly known as phytochemicals, in controlled industrial warehouses without further depleting the soil, using precious water, or exploiting indigenous people. You can now obtain ginsenoside or curcuminoids or\u2014name your favorite plant chemical- without ever planting a seed or cutting a stem. The arguments against SynBio are mostly socioeconomic, with a side of fear of the unknown. Millions of farmers whose livelihoods revolve around growing medicinal herbs and nutrient rich plants could be left without jobs if SynBio becomes the norm in the herbal industry. Entire economies will be disrupted. If that isn't enough to worry about, the process of creating GMO yeasts or GMO euglenas still carry the original risks inherent in any sort of GMO endeavor: the modified organisms might escape the fermentation tanks, get out into the surrounding environment, and forever change the population of yeast or euglena. SynBio vs Synergy But let's return to the question, 'Is it equivalent?'. As a chemist, caffeine is caffeine regardless of whether it is a secondary metabolite of green tea, synthesized in a lab, or produced by GMO yeast or euglena. It is technically possible to differentiate organically synthesized caffeine from naturally occurring caffeine in green tea. But if the compound is produced by a living organism, GMO or not, and it is in pure form, there should be no detectable differences in functionality, as a single chemical. But we need to consider the so-called entourage effect. Before this term was popularized by the clever marketers of cannabis-derived substances, herbalists used to call it the 'synergistic effect.' It means that all the phytochemicals of a medicinal plant working together are responsible for the observed therapeutic effect. It's not just one 'superstar' compound working alone.There's more to a medicinal herb than its purified phytochemicals. Herbalists still generally rely on this principle. Caffeine is one phytochemical in a family of others called xanthines. I love my xanthines. They help me write late into the night. I get mine from Yerba Mate which tests high in theophylline, theobromine, and caffeine. Coffee tests high in caffeine. The two plants work differently on me. And so would a single chemical, formerly known as a phytochemical, that came from algal cells growing in a factory somewhere. In the end, I approach the equivalency question with another question: what is the final purpose of the product? Are we trying to recreate the health benefits of green tea, which has a multitude of phytochemicals that work together for the desired effect? Or are we seeking a new source of caffeine to fortify a bubbly, sugary beverage? From a legal standpoint the regulators as well as many people in our industry are able to say with clear eyes and untroubled conscience that using modified microorganisms to produce substances normally made by plants is not really \"GMO.\" It is just something created from GMOs. Undeniable, are the unknowns that still plague the GMO topic in general. These are philosophical and ethical questions for sure. But they are also practical concerns. Will the numerous countries that have banned GMO crops permit the use of ingredients made by GM'ed microorganisms? Will regulators ever know? Will they be able to tell the difference? Will anyone require disclosure on product labels? From and end-user perspective, does it matter? Chemically, SynBio ingredients are equivalent to their plant-derived counterparts. But there's more to an herbal medicine than the chemicals it contains. In the economically-driven rush toward SynBio, I hope we do not lose sight of that. END Elan M.

He is a board member of AHPA, as well as AHPA's Education and Research on Botanicals Foundation. As a kid I grew up in doctors' offices and labs. It's not because I was sick. Rather my mother and father both worked there. My mother was a microbiologist who applied those skills to live blood cell analysis and allergy testing, and then later worked in government microbiology labs where she researched models of tuberculosis dormancy. My father was a chemist who later studied herbal medicine, acupuncture, and then became a chiropractor. My parents had a clinic where I played in the back as a young child, then worked the front desk when I got a little older. Medical practitioners, and practitioner-focused supplement products were part of my life from the beginning- I remember thinking all the Metagenics reps must have been models. Quality-conscious medical practitioners can play a vital role in holding supplement companies accountable and driving them to truly make good on their quality and transparency promises. Given this background it's fitting that I now run Alkemist Labs, the supplement industry's biggest little botanical testing lab. We focus on analytical testing to establish botanical identity, purity, and potency. Because I have a particular affinity for healthcare practitioners, and the products that they recommend, I am grateful for the opportunity to share with you some of the essential things you need to know about botanical quality testing. It's important to understand that herbs are more complicated to test than vitamins, minerals, or other single component ingredients. Most of the latter have long-established specifications that they must meet, with \"quality\" indicated by a numeric value, such as how many grams of protein or vitamin A the ingredient contains. While those are not necessarily easy analyses to perform, the definition of quality is very clear-cut. The ingredients need to meet some number. If they don't, then they fail. It's fairly well-defined. Herbs are more complex. To begin, let's get philosophical. What is the definition of Ashwagandha root (Withania somnifera)? By simple labeling criteria, an ingredient marked \"Ashwaghanda root\" is not Ashwagandha leaf. A lot of Ashwagandha material on the market is labeled as \"root\" but it also contains Ashwaghanda leaf as a filler. Leaf isn't bad but it isn't the root, which is where most of the beneficial phytochemicals hang out. It may be the right plant, but it's the wrong part. And by law, a label has to specifically disclose the contents. \"High quality\" is a common value proposition, but it usually stays very shallow. The best brands in this industry are doing the work, and offering batch to batch lab reports to document the quality of their products. Unfortunately, adulteration is rampant in the international market for botanical ingredients, as demand for herbal medicines rises and supplies vary year to year. It's a problem that many people within the supplement industry are working diligently to remedy. This also is why accurate identity testing for plant, and plant part, is crucial. There are a variety of ways to test the identity of herbs, but not all of them are \"fit for purpose.\" Using Ashwagandha as an example, when you are considering products for your dispensary, you need to know: A) Is it a sample with a genetic match to a control sample of the Ashwagandha plant? B) Does the sample give a light box response signal match with that of a library reference sample? C) Is it a sample with a specific quantity of Withanolides-a family of well-studied chemicals found in Ashwagandha and thought to be important in its biological activity and clinical efficacy? D) Do the microscopic cellular features match those of a verified reference material of the appropriate plant part, and not those of known adulterants, closely related species, or fillers? E) Does the chromatographic profile or \"fingerprint\" match that of a verified reference material of the appropriate plant part and not that of known adulterants or closely related species? DNA Analysis: Regarding genetic testing, the reality is that DNA Analysis has its limits as a quality indicator. That's because it can be easily tricked. DNA analysis only identifies the plant, not the specific plant part. Using our example of Ashwagandha, the root and the leaves will have the same genes. So, DNA testing can tell us if we have the right plant, but not whether we have the right part, which is very important in terms of product quality. DNA analysis is also not fit for purpose to test botanical extracts (tinctures, decoctions, etc), because typically there's very little plant DNA remaining in a liquid extract. Botanical supplement quality is dependent on physiological efficacy, and this is contingent on the specific phytochemicals in the herb. That said, it is important to remember that herbs are more than the sum of the chemical compounds they produce. Light Box Methdology: Light box response testing, aka \"Lab-In-A-Box,\" is a new algorithm-based technology that deploys surface level analysis and promises the moon and the stars. Suffice to say, it does not always deliver. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC): When it comes to analysis of biologically active compounds, HPLC is moving in the right direction, since most botanicals are sold based on claims to deliver specific families of phytochemicals. HPLC separates, identifies, and quantifies all the biochemical constituents of a given sample of plant material. This test will definitely tell you how much of each phytochemical constituent is in there. Even with the FDA-mandated disclaimer of, 'this product is not intended to treat, cure or prevent any illness,' the truth is that from a practical viewpoint, botanical supplement quality is dependent on physiological efficacy, and this is contingent on the specific phytochemicals in the herb. Consequently, HPLC is an important quality measure. That said, it is important to remember that herbs are more than the sum of the chemical compounds they produce. For example, the withanolides produced by Ashwagandha do not fully define the plant. Measuring a single or a few phytochemicals in a plant does not mean anything other than the presence or quantity of those phytochemicals. A positive HPLC for caffeine does not mean you have good coffee; someone can add caffeine powder to inert sawdust, and it will give a nice strong caffeine signal on HPLC. But you would not want to drink it. Microscopy: According to the FDA and other regulatory agencies worldwide, microscopy can confidently confirm the identity of a botanical ingredient in whole or powdered form. Microscopy looks at key cellular features of a given plant and compares it to verified reference materials, known adulterants, inert fillers, and flow agents. Microscopy is an important factor in the quality equation, but it has a major limitation. As is the case with DNA testing, the material being tested must be in whole plant or powder form, and not an extract. Herbal extracts are like the brown liquid you get when you make coffee; they're mostly void of the cellular connective tissue upon which microscopy relies. A positive HPLC for caffeine does not mean you have good coffee; someone can add caffeine powder to inert sawdust, and it will give a nice strong caffeine signal on HPLC. But you would not want to drink it. High-Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) Fingerprinting: This is my favorite approach to plant identity validation. It is elegant and nuanced, scientific, yet 'eyeball-ometric.' It provides both qualitative and quantitative information. The process involves making an extract of the test sample using solvents, and then comparing the HPLC profile against that of the same type of extract made from verified reference materials. It is important to also compare the sample against the HPLC fingerprints of known adulterants. So now that you have had a crash course in botanical identity testing, ask your supplement brands how they ensure that what is on their labels is what's in their bottles. Better yet, ask them to just share their quality assurance data! \"Transparency\" is a popular term these days. But it is not just another buzz word. I believe it is the next generation of brand differentiation. Some brands spend millions of dollars each year testing their products internally and/or testing them with 3rd party labs like Alkemist Labs, but most fail to share that quality story. \"High quality\" is a common value proposition, but it usually stays very shallow. The best brands in this industry are doing the work, and offering batch to batch lab reports to document the quality of their products. It's an important advancement. Quality-conscious medical practitioners can play a vital role in holding supplement companies accountable and driving them to truly make good on their quality and transparency promises. END Elan M.

Findings from a small but noteworthy study provide new evidence that a traditional Chinese herbal formula can improve clinical markers of osteoporosis. Researchers compared osteoporosis patients treated with either the mainstay drug alendronate, or a formula known as Dihuang Decoction (DHD), a traditional Chinese prescription long used to prevent and heal bone diseases. They found similar outcomes in both groups, suggesting that the herbal formula-a TCM staple consisting of six herbs including Chinese glutinosa) and the medicinal Poria (Wolfiporia cocos) mushroom-is equivalent to the prescription drug as far as its impact on bone density. Researchers speculate that the effectiveness of the Rehmannia decoction as an osteoporosis therapy lies in its natural ability to promote healthy immune functioning. The results add to the scientific literature documenting this formula's myriad pharmacological and therapeutic effects. This herbal formula is widely used in TCM preventatively, and as a treatment for various bone and joint diseases and a host of other conditions. The patients in the experimental group, who averaged about 64 years old, took DHD twice weekly (one morning dose plus one evening dose on each treatment day). The alendronate-treated control group were of similar age. They followed a standard alendronate regimen, taking 70 mg orally once a week. Patients in both groups also took 600 mg of calcium carbonate D3, and 0.5 g of calcitriol capsules per day throughout the study. The difference in BMD between the two groups following treatment was not statistically significant, suggesting similar rates of improvement with both treatment types. Over the course of a year, investigators analyzed three key markers of osteoporosis: femoral neck and lumbar vertebrae bone mineral density peptide (beta-CTX), and serum osteoclast (SOST) levels. The two began the study with comparable BMD, SOST, and beta-CTX baseline values. After one year, participants in both groups showed statistically significant improvements in femoral neck and lumbar BMD. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant, suggesting similar rates of improvement from the herbs and from the drug. Serum beta-CTX values also dropped across groups following treatment. Elevated beta-C-CTX levels indicate increased bone resorption and are associated with osteoporosis. Participants' serum SOST values remained comparable after treatment as well. The researchers propose that DHD, like alendronate, can be an effective treatment for primary osteoporosis. This preliminary trial reflects a greater emerging interest in studying the ancient formula and its health-promoting properties. Immune Benefits Osteoporosis is very common among older adults. In the United States, a rapidly aging population means that the prevalence will only continue to escalate in the years to come. The immune system may be involved in the development of osteoporosis in some patients. Bone cells and immune cells share a close relationship--both are located in the bone marrow, and they communicate using a shared language of regulatory molecules, signaling molecules, and transcription factors (Zhao H, et al. J Immunol Res. 2018 (2018): 6345857). Immune cells help regulate the normal process of bone turnover. Abnormal immune system activation can trigger an imbalance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, the two bone cell types primarily responsible for new bone formation and bone resorption. The researchers propose that Dihuang Decoction, like alendronate, can be an effective treatment for primary osteoporosis. Researchers speculate that the effectiveness of the Rehmannia decoction as an osteoporosis therapy lies in its natural ability to promote healthy immune function. Zhou and colleagues reviewed several studies of the traditional Liuwei Dihuang prescription and the wide range of pharmacological effects it exerts, particularly on the neuroendocrine immunomodulation (NIM) (Zhou W, et al. Pharma Therap. 2016; 162: 170-178). A 2019 research proposal laid out a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis that investigators could use to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Liuwei Dihuang as an intervention for primary osteoporosis (Liu Y, et al. Medicine. 2019; 98(16): e15282). The findings from that analysis could guide future clinical recommendations for this unique herbal combination in the context of bone disease treatment. Intentional adulteration of herbs is not a novel threat in the dietary supplement world, but it's showing up in new ways amid the coronavirus pandemic. In response, the industry is intensifying its efforts to detect, reject, and destroy adulterated raw materials. The US Pharmacopeia defines Economically Motivated Adulteration as: \"The fraudulent addition of non-authentic substances or removal or replacement of authentic substances without the purchaser's knowledge for economic gain of the seller.\" Today, with public demand for immune support products at an all-time high, and disruption of international supply chains leading to raw materials shortages, the potential for fraud has grown. \"History teaches that high-value ingredients are at most risk of economic adulteration during periods of supply chain shortages and/or sudden demand increases,\" said Michael D. Levin, a supplement industry consultant. Cleaning Up the Supply Chain Levin is an advisor to the Botanical Adulterants Prevention Program (BAPP), a collaboration between the American Botanical Council (ABC), American Herbal Pharmacopoeia (AHP), and the University of Mississippi's National Center for Natural Products Research (NCNPR). BAPP tracks herbal adulteration, and sounds alarms when new incidents are identified. Last year, BAPP launched an industry-wide self-policing initiative called, \"Burn It, Don't Return It\" that puts direct economic pressure on raw materials suppliers to improve quality and eliminate adulteration. Launched last October with support from major industry trade groups, the program outlines contract terms and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to be used by supplement brands in their raw materials purchasing agreements. The terms stipulate that if a manufacturer's quality assurance officers detect \"irreparably defective\" raw materials\u2014contaminants, adulterants, or substitutions that cannot be removed or lawfully rectified\u2014 those materials are to be destroyed at the supplier's expense. Gingko powder containing plants other than Ginkgo biloba, or St. John's Wort extract containing Red Dye #2, are two simple examples. \"History teaches that high-value ingredients are at most risk of economic adulteration during periods of supply chain shortages and/or sudden demand increases.\" \u2014Michael D. Levin, Health Business Strategie Levin says \"Burn It,\" which is still in early stages of implementation, fills a big hole in the FDA's regulations: the current FDA Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines do not outline procedures for how supplement companies should handle irreparably defective ingredients. In too many cases, they simply return the rejected materials to the suppliers, who then re-sell them elsewhere. New Standards Mark Blumenthal, founder and director of the American Botanical Council, which sponsors the BAPP program, hopes BAPP's forthcoming finalized contract and SOPs will aid the herbal industry in solving the perennial issue of adulteration. \"We're empowering companies to take control of this part of the supply chain, to take defective material out of it.\" Levin believes the model \"will become a widely adopted industry standard within two years.\" He also foresees GMP certification programs eventually adopting the BAPP's approach \"as a GMP standard.\" In the wake of COVID, elderberry is among the herbs most vulnerable to counterfeiting. Blumenthal says there is not yet any international scientific literature addressing elderberry adulteration. But BAPP has consulted with at least one reputable maker of elderberry products that has identified fraudulent materials in products tested in independent 3rd party labs. BAPP is currently drafting a bulletin on elderberry adulteration to educate consumers, health professionals, and industry members. Vexations in Vetting Supplement companies have responded to the adulteration challenge by ramping up ingredient analysis. Elan Sudberg, CEO of Alkemist Labs, reports \"an uptick in testing, specifically the immune system boosting herbs, which are selling like hot cakes these days.\" If the pandemic continues into next year, \"the supply chain will continue to be strained, while demand will continue to be high. All the tricks unscrupulous venders may use, from plant substitution, to providing the wrong plant part, to spiking for higher potency, will be in play, which is why testing plants at a lab that knows botanicals inside and out is crucial,\" he urged. \"Because in-person audits have all but subsided, testing ingredients with a third-party lab is more critical than ever.\" -Elan Sudberg, Alkemist Labs After COVID hit, Alkemist received requests to analyze \"a lot of duplicate samples, meaning our clients were acquiring samples and testing them as part of their process of determining what new vendor they could possibly buy key ingredients from,\" Sudberg said. \"Ordinarily, that may have involved a long plane flight to countries that now won't let Americans in, so the usual vetting process isn't an option right now.\" In addition to doctored ingredients, some raw materials suppliers are issuing dubious Certificates of Analysis (C of A's) -basically bogus lab reports\u2014in their marketing materials. They simply copy legitimate reports from reputable labs like Alkemist or DNA4, and post them in C of A's for batches of herbs the labs have never tested. FDA Enforcement Curtailed Part of the problem is that the pandemic has significantly curtailed the FDA's on-the-ground enforcement. \"FDA publicly stated early on that they will be unlikely to perform onsite audits for a while,\" Sudberg says. The lack of oversight opens the door to more fraud. \"When there are no police monitoring stop signs, people stop stopping as much. When the likelihood of adulteration being spotted by regulatory agencies goes down, the need for brands to be even more vigilant goes up.\" \"We're empowering companies to take control of this part of the supply chain, to take defective material out of it.\" Mark Blumenthal, Executive Director, American Botanical Council \"Because in-person audits have all but subsided, testing your ingredients with a third-party lab is more critical than ever,\" Sudberg stressed. Based on the sustained high volume of testing at Alkemist in recent weeks, he believes the industry as a whole is taking this seriously. \"Testing is still up, which likely means more vendor qualification is happening.\" The spotlight has been on elderberry lately, but a number of other popular botanicals are also at risk of economically motivated adulteration: Lavender: Adulteration of lavender oil can occur in several ways, says ABC. Some products are mixed with oils from other similar plants like spike lavender; others contain synthetic components whose odor and chemistry resemble genuine lavender oil. Still others include the \"undeclared admixture of non-volatile solvents such as glycols, benzyl benzoate, benzyl salicylate, triethyl citrate, or vegetable oils such as coconut oil.\" BAPP recently issued a bulletin on English lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), the latest in its ongoing series of peer-reviewed publications on botanical adulteration. Pomegranate: is naturally high in ellagic acid. Dishonest products may contain ellagic acid from other less expensive sources like wood pulp. This raises the concentration of this key chemical constituent, but it creates a false sense of value, especially because the additive is not disclosed. Grape seed extract (GSE): is a natural byproduct from the wine and juice industries. BAPP has identified GSE adulterated with peanut skin extract, which Blumethal says originates largely from China. Peanut skin extract, a byproduct of the peanut industry, is less expensive and available at a much greater volume than actual GSE. Bilberry: is often adulterated with dark anthocyanidin pigments from other cheaper berries, soybean or rice hulls. Some sellers create adulterated products so sophisticated they can pass through laboratory testing undetected. Saw Palmetto: Extracts from the saw palmetto, a type of palm tree, are common in natural treatments for urinary and prostate disorders. Saw palmetto extract (SPE) may be substituted or blended with lower-cost vegetable oils, especially palm oils, to achieve a similar fatty acid profile. It was the subject of, \"one of the most egregious cases\" of botanical adulteration, says Blumenthal. Two years ago, BAPP broke the news of a Chinese saw palmetto supplier that obtained sheep, cow, chicken and pork-derived fat from a slaughterhouse and used it to adulterate SPE. The animal fatty acids were isolated and recombined to match fatty acid ratios indicated in the US Pharmacopeia (USP) for saw palmetto. The mixture was so chemically sophisticated that high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the widely utilized analytical method, couldn't detect the animal-based compounds. Mint Oil: In one of BAPP's most recent victories, natural products manufacturer NOW Foods, owner of the Protocol for Life Balance practitioner brand, rejected and destroyed a shipment of mint oil from India after determining it was adulterated with safflower oil. Unethical? Yes. Dangerous? No. The good news is that so far, BAPP has \"found very few examples where the adulteration we've uncovered has any real safety concerns. Even though deplorable, even though morally objectionable--very few (of these cases) have safety implications.\" There are, however, exceptions. Consider skullcap (Scutellaria lateriflora) adulterated with germander (Teucrium alike, but germander contains hepatotoxic compounds while skullcap does not. When the one is substituted for the other\u2014whether accidentally or intentionally\u2014there's a potential for liver damage. Most botanical adulteration is not accidental or due to human error. It is an intentional and deliberate attempt to cut costs, enhance a product's activity or increase its value. Sudberg recommends that clinicians \"use or sell only brands that offer as much transparency as possible, and have a demonstrated and verifiable commitment to quality. Asking about their sourcing and testing practices is always a good idea, but now "}
