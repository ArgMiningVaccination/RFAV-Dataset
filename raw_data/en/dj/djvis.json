Acupuncture is a form of treatment used by qualified TCM practitioners which involves the insertion of extremely fine pre-sterilized, single use only stainless steel needles at pre-determined points on the body surface (known as \"acupuncture points\") to promote or restore health and wellbeing. In the hands of a fully qualified professional practitioner the use of acupuncture is entirely safe and free of any harmful side-effects. It has stood the test of time over several thousands of years and has not been found wanting. Moxibustion is a form of heat treatment which is used by a fully qualified TCM practitioner when appropriate. The treatment is carried out by applying a substance known as \"moxa\" over a particular area or acupuncture point. This introduces heat into the area for therapeutic effect. This form of therapy is a highly sophisticated and ancient specialism in TCM terms, quite unlike any western, contemporary approximation. It involves careful monitoring of food and drink intake in order to eliminate disease and speed recovery. The TCM practitioner can advise a patient regarding the type of food eaten, the time and manner in which it is eaten, or the manner in which it is prepared, in order to promote cure and enhance health. This is a very extensive part of TCM and includes the dispensing of various Chinese herbal prescriptions in the form of natural herbs, pills, tablets, powders, ointments and other medical preparations.

This forms a crucial part of TCM treatment and concentrates on eliminating factors in the patient's life style or daily living activities that contribute to the cause or prolongation of a health complaint. Alternatively, the client can be instructed upon how to positively promote active health and increase wellbeing by suitably modifying the way they live. Clearly, this type of specifically TCM instruction has no equivalent in conventional, western, medicine. Medical Qigong is a form of treatment used by specially trained and qualified TCM practitioners. Unlike all other treatment modalities it dispenses with intervening instruments and medicaments. Instead, it involves the employment of the practitioner's own Qi to bring about or restore harmonious and smooth flow to the client's Qi, thus helping to restore health and well-being. It is the most rarefied and specialised form of TCM treatment. For more "}
