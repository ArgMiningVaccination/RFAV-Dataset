I particularly like this sentence: The modern skeptical movement is a grassroots phenomenon that aims at helping the public navigate the complex borderlands between sense and nonsense, science and pseudoscience. But what is the point of navigating those complex borderlands? I don't think an answer is given explicitly in the statement. It seems to me that navigating well enables us to make good assessments of the trustworthiness of claims of popular and practical interest along with the people and organizations that make the claims. There are significant advantages in trusting in what's verifiably true, not simply in what's comforting, reassuring, or aligned with our assumptions. Misplacing trust in what isn't verifiably true can have serious consequences as explained by Robert A. Steiner in his book, Don't Get Taken: Bunco and Bunkum Exposed (1989, p. 5): You can be taken! You can be the mark (sucker, pigeon, victim, dupe, target, patsy, chump, rube, fall guy, gull, sap, sitting duck) of a confidence game. You can learn to trust someone who will do you wrong. He or she will appear sincere and will win your confidence. You might lose your money, your self-esteem, your health, and sometimes even your very life. These losses are the result of placing your confidence in the wrong person. President Ronald Reagan famously used the expression \"trust, but verify\" in reference to nuclear disarmament discussions with the Soviet Union. Trusting before you verify can be folly. I think a slight variation of the expression better reflects what I call healthy skepticism: trust based on verification. Close examination of relevant evidence and sound reasoning are needed for verification. The word skeptic is derived from skeptomai (Greek) meaning to peer about, to watch, to look closely. The word scope is also derived from skeptomai. Just as we use telescopes to look closely at far away objects and microscopes to look closely at tiny objects, we apply skepticism to look closely\u2014and, I must add, carefully\u2014at claims of interest. [Occam's razor](https://fs.blog/2019/10/occams-razor/) is a rule of thumb for a careful, scientific mindset. I like this version of it: \"Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.\" In other words, don't assume too much. Science is important to healthy skepticism because of its rigor in providing verification with evidence. Science doesn't always offer clear or correct answers, but it is self-correcting and increasingly illuminating over time. Science generates trustworthy knowledge through its objectivity, systematic commitment to testing, reproducibility, and openness to criticism. Denying or disregarding verified science leads to misplaced trust. Skepticism should not be confused with either science denialism or cynicism. A cynic is [defined](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-01-28/37964) as a \"sneering faultfinder; one who doubts or denies the goodness of human motives, and who often displays his attitude by sneers, sarcasm, etc.\" I see cynicism as a venomous outlook. It makes no sense to speak of healthy cynicism. The most famous denialist and cynic in the world is President Donald J. Trump. I haven't seen him display any inclination toward healthy skepticism. I don't trust much of what he has had to say. He has been especially untrustworthy regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. \"COVID, COVID, COVID\" Here's how I concluded my [August 13 Consumer Health column](https://skepticalinquirer.org/exclusive/trump-and-covid-19-population-health-neglect-hydroxychloroquine-hype-and-a-gamblers-fallacy/) about President Trump and COVID-19: Trump said that the United States is in the process of crafting a strategy to combat the pandemic. That was [three weeks ago]\u2014not in February when the spread of the coronavirus could still be contained. I'm still waiting for Trump to reveal his strategy. He never did reveal a strategy. Instead, Trump ended his reelection campaign with [repeated claims that \"we are rounding the turn\" on the pandemic](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-says-we-re-rounding-turn-covid-19-spreading-faster-n1244942) and that [we would stop hearing about \"COVID, COVID, COVID\" from \"the fake news media\" on November 4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2020/11/11/trump-predicted-covid-covid-covid-would-end-after-the-election-its-worse-than-ever/?sh=6101f23f6512). After recovering from his own affliction with COVID-19, he continued to [hold mask-optional campaign rallies with thousands of people and social distancing frowned upon](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-rallies-virus-surges-50e79fabd46472c51ecc1444184082de). Weeks after Election Day, the continuing, catastrophic rise in COVID-19 [counts of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/11/coronavirus-death-rate-third-surge/617150/) in the United States continues to be major news along with Trump's neglect of it. In a new Monmouth University poll of the American public, the coronavirus pandemic was the issue identified by the most respondents (42 percent) as the top issue faced in the next four years by our president. Nevertheless, we learned that Trump hasn't attended a meeting of the White House's coronavirus task force [in more than five months](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2020/11/15/trump-hasnt-attended-meeting-of-coronavirus-task-force-in-five-months-member-says/?sh=5666d62b33a2). On November 21, [Trump skipped a meeting of G20 Summit world leaders about the pandemic and went golfing](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-skipped-g20-coronavirus-meeting-to-play-golf-2020-11). Trump, who [claimed during the 2016 campaign](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/03/politics/donald-trump-golf-analysis/index.html) that [he would not have time to golf if elected](https://trumpgolfcount.com/), golfed throughout his presidency at [enormous taxpayer expense and made more trips to his golf courses in November 2020 than in any previous November of his presidency](https://trumpgolfcount.com/displayoutings). While disregarding the global health crisis, Trump has been busy trying to undermine confidence in the integrity of Joe Biden's election victory. He continues to gush a [\"firehose of falsehood,\"](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2020/11/29/rauch-trump-has-mastered-the-firehose-of-falsehood.cnn/video/playlists/reliable-sources-highlights/) claiming [without evidence](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/22/politics/chris-christie-donald-trump-election/index.html) that [hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes flipped the election against him](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1330327620148465664). To make matters worse, his administration [took weeks to grant Biden access to information needed to ensure a smooth presidential transition](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/24/biden-intelligence-briefings-access-440407) to properly prepare to address national security challenges including COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Despite Trump's post-election [efforts to undermine democracy and cling to power](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/20/politics/trump-american-democracy/index.html) and the continuing alarming media coverage of the public health impact of COVID-19, the Gallup organization [reported](https://news.gallup.com/poll/326885/biden-favorability-rises-trump-dips.aspx) that Trump's favorability rating decreased by only three percentage points to 42 percent in a post-election survey. [According to FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/), polls in early November indicated that 40 percent approved of Trump's handling of the pandemic despite his [repeated false assurances over months that the pandemic was under control](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/how-trump-shifted-his-tone-on-coronavirus-134246). I guess 40 percent were unaware of, uninterested in, or unconvinced by evidence that [Trump purposely misrepresented the coronavirus threat to the American people](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/10/911368698/trump-tells-woodward-he-deliberately-downplayed-coronavirus-threat) and about [how bad the U.S. pandemic response has been](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/10/us-leads-19-nations-covid-19-all-cause-death-rates). I doubt that many scientists and medical experts were among that 40 percent. Voices of Science and Medicine Struck Back After [audio recordings](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/10/911368698/trump-tells-woodward-he-deliberately-downplayed-coronavirus-threat) of Bob Woodward's interviews with Trump in February and March about the coronavirus became public, H. Holden Thorp, Editor-in-Chief of Science Journals for the American Association for Advancement of Science wrote in an [editorial](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6510/1409?rss=1): ... we can hear Trump's own voice saying that he understood precisely that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was deadly and spread through the air. As he was playing down the virus to the public, Trump was not confused or inadequately briefed: He flat-out lied, repeatedly, about science to the American people. These lies demoralized the scientific community and cost countless lives in the United States. Thorp added about the lies: \"This may be the most shameful moment in the history of U.S. science policy.\" On September 24, the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine jointly issued this [statement](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2020/09/nas-and-nam-presidents-alarmed-by-political-interference-in-science-amid-pandemic): As advisers to the nation on all matters of science, medicine, and public health, we are compelled to underscore the value of science-based decision-making at all levels of government. Our nation is at a critical time in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic with important decisions ahead of us, especially concerning the efficacy and safety of vaccines. Policymaking must be informed by the best available evidence without it being distorted, concealed, or otherwise deliberately miscommunicated. We find ongoing reports and incidents of the politicization of science, particularly the overriding of evidence and advice from public health officials and derision of government scientists, to be alarming. It undermines the credibility of public health agencies and the public's confidence in them when we need it most. Ending the pandemic will require decision-making that is not only based on science but also sufficiently transparent to ensure public trust in, and adherence to, sound public-health instructions. Any efforts to discredit the best science and scientists threaten the health and welfare of us all. In October, the editors of The New England Journal of Medicine lambasted the \"leaders\" of the United States, expressing astonishment at the magnitude of their failed COVID-19 response resulting in tens of thousands of lives lost. They [concluded](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2029812): Anyone else who recklessly squandered lives and money in this way would be suffering legal consequences. Our leaders have largely claimed immunity for their actions. But this election gives us the power to render judgment. Reasonable people will certainly disagree about the many political positions taken by candidates. But truth is neither liberal nor conservative. When it comes to the response to the largest public health crisis of our time, our current political leaders have demonstrated that they are dangerously incompetent. We should not abet them and enable the deaths of thousands more Americans by allowing them to keep their jobs. In October, both the [American College of Emergency Physicians](https://www.emergencyphysicians.org/press-releases/2020/10-25-20-acep-rebuts-president-trumps-false-statements-about-overcounting-covid-19-deaths) (ACEP) and the American Medical Association's president, [Susan R. Bailey, MD](https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/ama-statements/ama-statement-ongoing-attacks-physicians-treating-covid-patients), provided [rebuttals](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/31/trump-claims-doctors-profiting-attributing-deaths-covid-19/6101540002/) to President Trump's baseless, cynical assertions that physicians purposely over count COVID-19 deaths to make more money. Dr. Bailey also wrote: The assault on public health and the undermining of efforts to defeat COVID-19 began with unfounded suspicions about the science and evidence of this novel coronavirus and how it spreads. It grew with speculation about harmful and unproven treatments for COVID-19, false claims that masks were a source of infections, and by misleading suggestions that increased testing alone explains why case counts are surging. It expanded again with inaccurate, dangerous statements about children being \"almost immune\" from the most serious effects of COVID-19, a reckless plan of \"focused protection\" and naturally acquired \"herd immunity\" as a pathway out of this pandemic, and most recently with wild and highly offensive claims that physicians are inflating the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths to increase our incomes. At every turn, at the highest levels of government, our motives and efforts are undermined, questioned and discredited in a misguided attempt to downplay the seriousness of the pandemic we continue to fight. Scientific American magazine took a [bolder, more controversial stand](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientific-american-endorses-joe-biden1/). Its editors wrote: Scientific American has never endorsed a presidential candidate in its 175-year history. This year we are compelled to do so. We do not do this lightly. The evidence and the science show that Donald Trump has badly damaged the U.S. and its people\u2014because he rejects evidence and science. The most devastating example is his dishonest and inept response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which [cost more than 190,000 Americans their lives]by the middle of September. He has also attacked environmental protections, medical care, and the researchers and public science agencies that help this country prepare for its greatest challenges. That is why we urge you to vote for Joe Biden, who is offering fact-based plans to protect our health, our economy and the environment. These and other proposals he has put forth can set the country back on course for a safer, more prosperous and more equitable future. The journal Nature also [endorsed Biden](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02852-x) for the presidency so that he would have \"an opportunity to restore trust in truth, in evidence, in science and in other institutions of democracy, heal a divided nation, and begin the urgent task of rebuilding the United States' reputation in the world.\" Nature's editors wrote about Trump: No US president in recent history has so relentlessly attacked and undermined so many valuable institutions, from science agencies to the media, the courts, the Department of Justice \u2014 and even the electoral system. Trump claims to put 'America First'. But in his response to the pandemic, Trump has put himself first, not America. His administration has picked fights with the country's long-standing friends and allies, and walked away from crucial international scientific and environmental agreements and organizations: notably, the 2015 Paris climate accord; the Iran nuclear deal; the United Nations' science and education agency UNESCO; and even, unthinkable in the middle of a pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO). An [October 5 news item](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02800-9) in Nature blamed Trump for exacerbating the pandemic, rolling back environmental and health regulations, and undermining science and scientific institutions. A November 3 news item in Nature described [\"Four ways Trump has meddled in pandemic science \u2014 and why it matters.\"](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03035-4) The four ways were: (1) scientists sidelined, silenced, and ignored; (2) political appointees in the Department of Health and Human Services attempted to delay or halt the release of and retroactively edit the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR); (3) expert advice ignored; (4) FDA pressured to prematurely approved COVID-19 treatments. Consistent with Nature's assessment, the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis made similar points. It published the [findings of a staff analysis](https://coronavirus.house.gov/news/press-releases/select-subcommittee-analysis-shows-pattern-political-interference-trump) that identified \"47 separate incidents of political interference in the Administration's coronavirus response spanning from February through September 2020.\" In a [letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7222830-Foege-Letter.html) dated September 23, to current CDC director Robert Redfield, MD, former CDC director [William Foege, MD, MPH](https://www.sph.emory.edu/departments/gh/fellows/foege/bill-foege/index.html), a leader in the efforts that led to the eradication of smallpox, wrote: - Despite the White House spin attempts, this will go down as a colossal failure of the public health system of this country. The biggest challenge in a century and we let the country down. The public health texts of the future will use this as a lesson on how not to handle an infectious disease pandemic. - The cause will be the incompetence and illogic of the White House program. - The White House has had no hesitation to blame and disgrace CDC, you and State Governors. They will blame you for the disaster. In 6 months, they have caused CDC to go from gold to tarnished brass. After the letter was obtained and published by [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2020/10/06/expert-cdcs-redfield-should-expose-trump-covid-failures-leave-post/5899724002/), [Dr. Foege stood by what he wrote](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/10/08/921872526/past-cdc-director-urges-current-one-to-stand-up-to-trump). An October 31 editorial in The Lancet [concluded](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32260-1/fulltext): With so much loss and still more at stake, the 2020 presidential election is the opportune moment for the American electorate to embrace change for the better, to reject the stagnancy of complacency, to exchange a view bereft of intention with a vision of progress, and to rejoin the global community in the pursuit of a more equitable and sustainable future. In his editorial on [\"The State of Our Nation\"](https://skepticalinquirer.org/2020/09/the-state-of-our-nation/) for the September/October 2020 issue of Skeptical Inquirer magazine (published in August), Kendrick Frazier concluded: We are not a partisan organization. We extol science and reason. We promote education and critical thinking. We seek to understand our own biases, our often flawed thinking. We expose misinformation, wherever it originates. That's not partisan. But when the source of so much unabashed nonsense exacerbating our real problems and threatening our very democracy comes from the president and his cronies, we owe it to ourselves to acknowledge that fact as well. The Center for Inquiry's [\"Undermining Science and Secularism: A Chronology\"](https://centerforinquiry.org/trump-chronology/) recapped Trump's executive orders and federal agency policies of his administration that have attacked science and eroded the wall of separation between church and state. The chronology includes four instances of the Trump administration preventing COVID-19 policy or regulation to be guided by science. While I'm not aware of any reputable scientific organizations that praised Trump's handling of the pandemic, Trump's messaging throughout the pandemic to keep businesses operating normally received at least implicit approval from scientists who endorsed the [Great Barrington Declaration (GBD)](https://gbdeclaration.org/), a controversial document issued by [three scientists](https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/89204) on October 4. The GBD says: - Current lockdown policies [unspecified in the GBD] have devastating short-term and long-term effects on public health. - Those at minimal risk of harm from the disease should live their lives normally to build immunity to the coronavirus through natural infection. - \"Focused Protection\" of the old and infirm from developing COVID-19 is needed [but the GD doesn't provide guidance on how the old and infirm can be protected while others live their lives normally]. - Harm should be minimized until [herd immunity](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/09/herd-immunity-is-not-a-strategy/615967/)is reached. - Simple hygiene measures such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be used. The GBD does not explicitly mention the key public health measures recommended by the World Health Organization such as social distancing, mask wearing, rapid testing, and contact tracing that have been demonstrated to significantly reduce disease transmission. The GBD lists the names of forty-two medical and public health scientists and medical practitioners who have signed the document and claims more than 49,000 more have signed on. Scott Atlas, the neuroradiologist on the White House Coronavirus Task Force who served as [President Trump's major advisor on COVID-19](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/23/fauci-trump-hasnt-attended-covid-task-force-meeting-months/6009403002/) until [he resigned on November 30](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/30/politics/scott-atlas-resigns-trump-administration-coronavirus-task-force/index.html) was [slammed for tweeting on October 8 that the GBD is scientifically supported](https://www.newsweek.com/scott-atlas-trump-covid-response-science-editor-1537717). [Critics of the natural herd immunity approach include](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/herd-immunity-great-barrington-backlash-letter) Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus; twenty public health organizations that issued a [joint statement](https://www.bigcitieshealth.org/media-statement-great-barrington-declaration); and the [Infectious Diseases Society of North America jointly with the HIV Medicine Association](https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2020/herd-immunity-is-not-an-answer-to-a-pandemic/). More than 6,400 scientists, researchers, and healthcare professionals have signed the [John Snow Memorandum, ](https://www.johnsnowmemo.com/)which states: Any pandemic management strategy relying upon immunity from natural infections for COVID-19 is flawed. Uncontrolled transmission in younger people risks significant morbidity and mortality across the whole population. In addition to the human cost, this would impact the workforce as a whole and overwhelm the ability of healthcare systems to provide acute and routine care. Furthermore, there is no evidence for lasting protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 following natural infection and the endemic transmission that would be the consequence of waning immunity would present a risk to vulnerable populations for the indefinite future. Such a strategy would not end the COVID-19 pandemic but result in recurrent epidemics, as was the case with numerous infectious diseases before the advent of vaccination. It would also place an unacceptable burden on the economy and healthcare workers, many of whom have died from COVID-19 or experienced trauma as a result of having to practise disaster medicine. Trump's Assault on Truth In their introduction to Anti-Science and the Assault on Democracy: Defending Reason in a Free Society (2019, p 14), editors Michael J. Thompson and Gregory R. Smulewicz-Zucker wrote: \"The collective thesis of the essays that follow maintains that democracy is withering due in no small part to our culture's drifting away from the scientific mindset and the erosion of reason that results from it.\" Trump's contribution to the drift is unsurpassed. I see in Trump the qualities that, according to Eric Hoffer in The True Believer (1951, pp 105-106), are required to lead mass movements: The leader personifies the certitude of the creed and the defiance and grandeur of power. He articulates and justifies the resentment damned up in the souls of the frustrated. He kindles the vision of a breathtaking future so as to justify the sacrifice of a transitory present. He stages the world of make-believe so indispensable for the realization of self-sacrifice and united action. He evokes the enthusiasm of communion\u2014the sense of liberation from a petty and meaningless individual existence. What are the talents requisite for such a performance? Exceptional intelligence, noble character and originality seem neither indispensable nor perhaps desirable. The main requirements seem to be: audacity and a joy in defiance; an iron will; a fanatical conviction that he is in in possession of the one and only truth; faith in his destiny and luck; a capacity for passionate hatred; a delight in symbols (spectacles and ceremonials); unbounded brazenness which finds expression in a disregard of consistency and fairness; a recognition that the innermost craving of a following is for communion and there can never be too much of it; a capacity for winning and holding the utmost loyalty of a group of able lieutenants. This last faculty is one of the most essential and elusive. The uncanny powers of a leader manifest themselves not so much in the hold he has on the masses as in his ability to dominate and almost bewitch a small group of able men. These men must be fearless, proud, intelligent and capable of organizing and running large-scale undertakings, and yet they must submit wholly to the will of the leader, draw their inspiration and driving force from him, and glory in this submission. [Of course, it's not just men that Trump dominates. We must not forget [Kellyanne Conway](https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/22/politics/kellyanne-conway-alternative-facts/index.html) and [Kayleigh McEnany](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cnns-kaitlan-collins-fires-back-at-kayleigh-mcenanys-activists-snipe-says-youre-not-doing-your-job) and so many others.] Trump's leadership qualities exploit what Richard Hofstadter called the [paranoid style in American politics](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55258625e4b00cfda38b47d7/t/56e84dc12fe131ff71851fca/1458064834964/Hofstadter-Paranoid-Style-American-Politics.pdf), which Hoftstadter described as characterized by feelings of persecution systematized in grandiose theories of conspiracy directed against a nation, a culture, or a way of life. Trump has an extensive record of [peddling unfounded conspiracies](https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/another-week-yet-another-trump-conspiracy/) and also [prevaricating](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/30/15631710/trump-bullshit). On October 22, the [Washington Post reported](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-is-averaging-50-false-claims-a-day-and-washington-post-fact-checker-team-cant-keep-up) that Trump was averaging more than fifty false or misleading claims a day and that he was on pace to make more than 25,000 total during his presidency by Election Day. Trump has convinced many millions with his use of [\"the big lie\"](https://theindependent.com/opinion/columnists/donald-trump-s-use-of-the-big-lie-with-covid-echoes-autocrats-past-and-present/article_1d044ad2-007f-11eb-a246-3740e0b64fb3.html) largely because he speaks with utmost confidence. As Mark Twain [wrote](http://www.twainquotes.com/Lies.html): \"The most outrageous lies that can be invented will find believers if a man only tells them with all his might.\" I suspect that Trump is effective at shamelessly misleading others in part because he sometimes deceives himself with his own [bullshit](https://psychcentralreviews.com/2016/book-review-on-bullshit/). In his foreword to the first edition of The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins, Robert Trivers wrote: ... if (as Dawkins argues) deceit is fundamental in animal communication, then there must be strong selection to spot the deception and this ought, in turn, to select for a degree of self-deception, rendering some facts and motives unconscious so as not to betray\u2014by the subtle signs of self-knowledge\u2014the deception being practiced. [Oxford University Press 30th Anniversary Edition, 2006, p xx.] Poor Excuses for Mendacity When Trump's devoted supporters recognize that he's not telling the truth, they can find clever ways to excuse his lying and [bullshitting](https://psychcentralreviews.com/2016/book-review-on-bullshit/). For example, Brad Todd, a Republican strategist and founding partner of an advertising agency, [famously said](https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/28/opinions/journalists-stop-taking-trump-seriously-todd/index.html) on Meet the Press Daily in August 2016: \"The voters take Donald Trump seriously as a candidate but they don't take him literally. The press takes Donald Trump literally but they don't take him seriously.\" In November 2016, [Todd complained](https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/28/opinions/journalists-stop-taking-trump-seriously-todd/index.html) that journalists \"over-value words\u2014and they are now covering a president who does not. President-elect Trump still takes the same cavalier approach to verbal description as he would in hawking a condo tower that's yet to be designed. And more than enough voters don't seem to mind.\" But condo buyers tend to mind when a condo tower fails to live up to its marketer's verbal description. Voters tend to mind being misled by politicians, but they only can mind when they can tell they've been misled. If they're unsuspecting because they have already misplaced their trust, they can become easily conned. Unfortunately, Trump took the same cavalier approach to \"verbal description\" of COVID-19 and public health policy that Todd said he would in hawking a condo. Trump [knew early on how serious the novel coronavirus threat was](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/09/politics/bob-woodward-rage-book-trump-coronavirus/index.html). He disregarded his scientific advisors when they told him what he didn't want to hear. Many Americans suffered and [died who wouldn't have if the United States had responded with effective public health responses as did some other countries](https://ncdp.columbia.edu/custom-content/uploads/2020/10/Avoidable-COVID-19-Deaths-US-NCDP.pdf). We should not take people literally or seriously when we can't trust that they mean what they say. I was inspired long ago when I read in Dr. Seuss's book Horton Hatches the Egg that Horton the elephant said: \"I meant what I said and I said what I meant. An elephant's faithful one-hundred percent.\" Trump is no elephant (as the [Lincoln Project](https://lincolnproject.us/team/) recognizes). Political Agenda Preferences and Trustworthiness I have suggested that healthy skepticism is needed for making good trustworthiness assessments. I have discussed Trump's indifference to science and truth telling, particularly regarding the pandemic, and the need for science-informed public policies. The COVID-19 pandemic has been the greatest threat to national security the United States has faced since the Cuban missile crisis, and Trump's response to it has been negligent. As [negligent as Ronald Reagan was when he was faced with the AIDS crisis](https://www.vox.com/2015/12/1/9828348/ronald-reagan-hiv-aids), I can't imagine him or any other previous president faced with COVID-19 failing as egregiously as Trump. Nevertheless, Trump received more than 74 million votes in the 2020 presidential election, the second highest vote total for a presidential candidate in history. Voters might not have trusted Trump to be consistently truthful or to respond well to the pandemic, but many supported his political agenda at least to some extent. Many Trump voters saw him as the least objectionable choice on the ballot. Many voted for him because they are [fanatical](https://news.yahoo.com/caller-tells-rush-limbaugh-willing-182740167.html) or [religious](https://religionnews.com/2020/11/17/trump-election/) in their devotion to him. Many still [deny that he lost](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-fraud-insight/why-republican-voters-say-theres-no-way-in-hell-trump-lost-idUSKBN2801D4) the election despite his dozens of failed legal challenges to the official state results. Many like the way he sticks it to the libs and Dems. Many think he's done a bad job, but they voted for him because they [\"swim in the cultural soup of Trumpism.\"](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/why-people-who-hate-trump-stick-him/616758/) Many think he made significant accomplishments during his term of office. They did indeed have a rational basis for trusting Trump to carry out parts of his 2016 political agenda and fulfill some campaign promises that they wanted him to fulfill. For example, he kept his promises to appoint conservatives to the federal judiciary, lower corporate tax, and move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Voters looking for a president to be unkind to asylum seekers had evidence that they could trust that Trump would continue to be unkind to them in a second term. Overall, voters had a rational basis to trust Trump to keep easily kept promises, but not much of a basis to trust him to deliver on his extraordinary claims (such as building a wall along the entire border with Mexico that Mexico would pay for) or what would take a brilliant policymaker and real master of the art of the deal to accomplish (such as replacing Obamacare with something better). The unsuspecting voters who trusted that Trump would \"drain the swamp\" ought to be disappointed in the swampiness of the Trump administration. They shouldn't be surprised that there is now a [presidential pardon bribery scheme that needs to be investigated](about:blank). They should be appalled that Trump has been [misleading his supporters with his post-election fundraising pitches](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/todaysdebate/2020/12/02/donald-trump-fundraising-challenge-voting-results-election-fraud-editorials-debates/3782460001/) while he continues to [lie about the results of the election](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/528469-trump-rants-against-election-results-for-45-minutes-in-new-video-post). What amazed me most about Trump's 2016 election victory was that he won despite having refused to release his tax returns to public scrutiny. Trump voters simply did not care enough or did not realize that he might have something significant to hide in his returns, such as signs of corrupt dealings or conflicts of interest. They trusted Trump without seeking verification of trustworthiness. Their political preferences trumped any inclination to consider the possibility of [betrayal of public trust](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2020/10/16/corruption-represents-ultimate-betrayal-of-public-trust/). And then when strong evidence emerged of that betrayal, denialism kicked in. One of my cousins is a devoted Trump supporter who believes that Trump really cares about America. I imagine he got that impression because Trump is quite good at proclaiming patriotic platitudes. But I'm not willing to trust that candidates who refuse to release their tax returns will act on behalf of the country's interests rather than their own interests. And I'm especially not inclined to trust people who have been lying and bullshitting for decades. Donald J. Trump said on Inauguration Day 2017: \"I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" I did not take him literally. I was not convinced that he meant what he said and said what he meant. "}
