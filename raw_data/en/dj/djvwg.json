COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are increasing at record numbers, with some healthcare systems preparing for bed and staff shortages. While safe and effective vaccines are on the horizon, communities will face numerous challenges related to logistics, distribution and overcoming vaccine hesitancy. In conversation with CDC Foundation President and CEO Dr. Judy Monroe, CDC Principal Deputy Director Dr. Anne Schuchat will discuss the current COVID-19 response, including the latest information about vaccines, and vaccine distribution plans. A local expert will also speak about vaccine-related challenges and opportunities. This will be the CDC Foundation's second webinar of a series for community-based organizations and their partners. Community-based organizations are crucial to an effective COVID-19 response. With the holiday surge upon us, it is vital that individuals and communities learn how to best protect our families, friends, communities and nation from COVID-19. "}
