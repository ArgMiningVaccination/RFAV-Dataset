The unique formula features 12 powerful herbs, vitamins, and minerals that boost your immune system, energy, prostate, and exterior appearance for whole-body results. Increases Energy and Combats Fatigue As testosterone production slows, many men experience fatigue and low energy levels. With poor energy, you may struggle to build muscle mass, work out, and enjoy daily activities. Prime Male contains Vitamin D3 and [ B6](https://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&context=mahpls_fac) for combatting fatigue and stimulating energy releases. [The Prime Male supplement](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/primemale) ingredients all contribute to improving energy levels. For example, ashwagandha extract, Vitamin D supplementation, and magnesium may reduce any fatigue symptoms you experience. With healthy testosterone production rates, the supplement restores your body to its energetic, active shape. Improves Libido and Sex Drive As your body's natural testosterone production slows, you may experience decreased sexual performance and erectile dysfunction. When men age, natural estrogen levels typically increase, which can also contribute to poor libido. While the female sex hormone, estrogen, is necessary in small portions, excess amounts with low testosterone levels can cause various health problems. Prime Male contains D-aspartic acid calcium chelate, an amino acid acting as an estrogen blocker and testosterone booster. With D-aspartic acid calcium chelate, you can boost testosterone levels, improve sperm quality, increase dopamine production, and decrease estrogen levels. The Prime Male website claims that D-aspartic acid calcium chelate can increase male testosterone levels by 42%. The supplement includes additional ingredients, like Korean red ginseng, which shows promising sperm motility and erection quality results across [ clinical trials](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3861174/). According to clinical research, Korean red ginseng can improve sperm production, quality, mobility, and preservation, while improving erections and libido. Promotes Lean Muscle Mass Muscle wasting often occurs as your body's testosterone levels dwindle. Reduced muscle mass, strength, and function are common among men with low testosterone concentrations. Prime Male promotes lean muscle mass with ingredients like ashwagandha root extract, magnesium, and luteolin. A [ 2015 clinical research study in India](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26609282/) showed that participants taking ashwagandha extract had reduced exercise-induced muscle damage with a decrease in body fat percentages. You can promote muscle growth with a healthy diet, regular exercise, and the comprehensive muscle-building ingredients in the formula. Improved muscle recovery rates and exercise regimens can also support your cardiovascular health and blood pressure. Helps Enhance Fat Loss A primary aspect of male virility is confidence in one's strong, healthy appearance. Prime Male helps you target stubborn body fat in multiple ways. First, the increased testosterone levels can boost your energy, helping you enjoy more beneficial workouts. The supplement also includes specific fat-burner ingredients, like zinc, magnesium, and ashwagandha root extract, that can help you shed stubborn belly fat while maintaining lean muscle mass. Reduced body fat may also improve your blood pressure, heart health, and overall confidence. Better Mood and Confidence Mood swings and depression are [ common effects](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24016385/) of reduced testosterone production in the male body. Many aging men suffer from anxiety, irritability, hypomania, low confidence, and more. Prime Male can raise testosterone levels to reverse these mood swings and negative effects, making you feel more balanced and confident. The Prime Male testosterone boosters also include ingredients that reduce stress and balance blood sugar levels, helping control irritability. According to Prime Male reviews, your mood swings may appear more severe before they improve. Prime Male side effects can include temporary mood swings as your body adjusts to the increased blood serum testosterone levels. Most Prime Male consumer reviews state that this effect resolves on its own after a few days.

Prime Male can increase testosterone and block estrogen production in multiple ways. The testosterone booster stimulates natural testosterone synthesis and increases free testosterone levels, allowing your body to produce the hormone at healthier rates. Increases Luteinizing Hormone D-aspartic acid is the star ingredient in the supplement's formula. Like other amino acids, D-aspartic acid helps your body create hormones and synthesize proteins. The natural amino acid stimulates luteinizing hormone synthesis by interacting with the hypothalamus in the brain, which can boost testosterone production. [ Clinical research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5340133/) has not yet confirmed the effectiveness of D-aspartic acid on testosterone levels in human participants, based on [ a systematic 2017 review study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5340133/). Prime Male also includes zinc which can help the pituitary gland release luteinizing hormone. Low luteinizing hormone and testosterone levels in men can cause severe health complications, including increased Alzheimer's disease risks. With increased luteinizing hormone levels, you can protect your health and reduce the effects associated with low testosterone levels. [Click Here for the Lowest Price and Exclusive Discounts on Prime Male](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/primemale) Decrease Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a protein that binds to androgen receptors, testosterone, and estrogen. A large percentage of your testosterone levels are bound to SHBG molecules. When SHBG binds to the hormone, it inhibits testosterone effects, rendering the levels biologically inactive. Because of SHBG, you only have limited free testosterone available. Prime Male includes magnesium and boron, which lower SHBG blood flow levels, increasing your free testosterone. [ Clinical research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20352370/) supports the efficacy of magnesium on free testosterone levels in sedentary and active individuals. The supplement also contains nettle root, which can release testosterone from SHBG. Nettle root can also help block estrogen production, which we'll discuss next. Regulates Estrogen Levels Estrogen is a female hormone, though men produce certain amounts to complete necessary bodily processes. If your body produces too much estrogen, it can reduce testosterone. The supplement contains ingredients like nettle root, luteolin, and boron, which can control estrogen levels while increasing testosterone. According to biological trace element research, [ boron](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4712861/) can help your body control estrogen, vitamin D, and testosterone levels for more efficient and beneficial impacts. Prime Male claims that the ingredient can reduce estrogen levels by as much as 39% in one week.

You want to select the right ingredients and formula for your needs, so you likely have a few remaining questions. Review answers to the most frequently asked questions about Prime Male below, so you can confidently make your decision. Is Prime Male Safe To Take? Prime Male is safe for most men over age 18. If you have pre-existing conditions or take prescription medications, you should speak with your doctor first. People with kidney issues may be unable to use Prime Male because of the high amino acid content. Similarly, men with high blood sugar may have complications from the ashwagandha ingredient. Most men can take the supplement safely. Always follow dosage recommendations and check the label for any allergies. If you notice side effects that don't resolve after a few days, stop taking the supplement and consult your doctor. Is Prime Male a steroid? No, Prime Male is not a steroid and contains no stimulating ingredients. Steroids are synthetic forms of testosterone that, when taken, will increase your T levels but can also cause many adverse side effects. Synthetic testosterone disturbs your body's natural hormone production, causing dangerous reactions. Men using steroids can experience the following [ negative effects](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/anabolic-steroid-misuse/): - High blood pressure - Blood clots - Heart attacks - Decreased sperm production and health - Enlarged breasts - Testicle shrinking - Artery damage - Erectile dysfunction - Reduced libido - Hair loss - Prostate cancer risks - Infertility Prime Male offers a safer alternative to steroids, stimulating your body's natural testosterone production. The supplement doesn't disrupt how your hormones function, so you won't experience all the negative effects listed above. With a natural alternative, you can enjoy more long-term results, whereas most can only take steroids short-term before the negative effects outweigh the positives. Do You Have To Cycle Prime Male? No, you may take the supplement for short or long periods. Supplement cycling refers to taking capsules for a few weeks and then stopping for a few, so your body doesn't generate a tolerance to the ingredients, reducing the effectiveness. The ingredients in Prime Male remain effective and safe for long periods, so you don't need to schedule any \"tolerance breaks.\" Does Prime Male Interact With Any Drug Medications? Because the supplement includes all-natural ingredients, it has no known drug interactions from clinical trials. Anyone using blood pressure medication should avoid Prime Male because it can increase blood flow, affecting your medication's effectiveness. You should always consult your doctor before taking any supplements if you use prescription medications, just to be sure. The ingredients may interact with pre-existing health conditions, like high blood sugar or kidney issues. Is Prime Male Vegan-Friendly? Yes, Prime Male is vegan-friendly. The supplement contains all-natural non-animal-derived ingredients with vegetable cellulose capsules. You may take the supplement if you follow a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle. Can Prime Male Help With Sex Drive and Libido? While Prime Male is not specifically a sex aid, it can improve your sex drive and libido by increasing testosterone. When testosterone levels drop, men frequently experience reduced sex drives, poor sperm quality, and other symptoms relating to prostate and sexual health. By improving testosterone levels, the supplement can restore your body's younger, healthier sex drive. Prime Male also includes ingredients that can improve sexual pleasure. For example, vitamin B6 can balance your moods and reduce depression, helping you feel more confident and satisfied in the bedroom. D-AA can also boost dopamine production, the brain chemical that makes you feel happy, which can improve sexual satisfaction and drive. Is It FDA-approved? Prime Male is not FDA-approved since the FDA does not have the authority to approve any dietary supplements. The company uses an FDA-approved and GMP-certified manufacturing facility to maintain quality control and to follow all strict safety protocols to create its product containing all-natural compounds, herbs, and vitamins. Final Thoughts on Prime Male Vitality Complex All men experience testosterone drops as they age. While the process is natural, it can cause unwanted effects. If you suffer from a low sex drive, constant fatigue, weight gain, muscle loss, mood swings, erectile dysfunction, or poor sperm health, a natural testosterone booster may help. We understand that picking the best testosterone booster supplement for your needs is a big decision. If you're interested in a potent formula that you can use long-term for sustained results, this supplement may be for you.
