It is motivated by a desire to support creativity and raise awareness of Anthroposophy. Anthroposophy is a spiritual path headlined by a German philosopher named Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925). As opposed to other paths that lean to one side or another, Anthroposophy seeks for equanimity and balance between the material and spiritual.
