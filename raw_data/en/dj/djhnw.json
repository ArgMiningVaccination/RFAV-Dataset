But even if they did, is being like me really a fate worse than death? The autistic brain is not particularly good at understanding irony, and yet most people I've met on the autism spectrum have, over time, developed a pretty strong grasp of the concept. Many of us have even managed to teach ourselves how to wield it. I've begun to suspect that this is due to our constant hands-on experience. Having an autism spectrum disorder in an ableist world means that you're constantly exposed to cruel irony. Most frequently, this comes in the form of neurotypical (i.e. non-autistic) people who tell you, incorrectly, that you can't or don't feel empathy like them, and then stubbornly refuse to care about your feelings when they claim that you're lost, that you're a burden, and that your life is a constant source of misery for you and everyone who loves you.

No matter what other lofty ideas of toxins and vaccine-related injury anti-vaxxers try to float around in their defense, that's really what all of this is about: we're facing a massive public health crisis because a disturbing number of people believe that autism is worse than illness or death. My neurology is the boogeyman behind a completely preventable plague in the making. The anti-vaccination movement is a particularly bitter issue for me because it doesn't just dehumanize me as an autistic person; it also sets off two of my biggest triggers. Like many people on the spectrum, I don't handle it well when people are 1) wrong, and 2) unfair. I've always struggled to be patient with people who are clearly and obstinately wrong. Most of my elementary school report cards contained some variation of \"Sarah does not suffer fools gladly\" and I can't honestly say that I've made significant improvements in that arena since then.
