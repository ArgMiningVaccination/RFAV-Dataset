The Norwalk agent is responsible for large scale, explosive epidemics of gastroenteritis in adults and children over 5 years of age. In addition to rotaviruses and the Norwalk and Norwalk-like viruses there are numerous other viruses which are putative agents of nonbacterial gastroenteritis. The involvement of adenoviruses in viral gastroenteritis was established after the finding of large numbers of particles morphologically resembling adenovirus in stools of persons ill with nonbacterial gastroenteritis. Astroviruses are 28 to 30 nm in diameter and have a characteristic 5 or 6 pointed star-shaped surface structure. The virus is thought to cause gastroenteritis in infants, children, and adults. Coronaviruses have been detected in stools of persons with gastroenteritis as well as asymptomatic children and adults. Meanwhile negative stain electron microscopy (EM) and Immune EM remain the most useful methods for detection of gastroenteritis viruses other than rotavirus. Stark Compulsion in Grave Circumstances [Robert Wheeler](https://taylorandfrancis.com/search-results/?query=Robert%2BWheeler&tab=books) in [Clinical Law for Clinical Practice](https://www.routledge.com/isbn/10.1201/9780429320583), 2020 This chapter presents a case study of a 12-year-old girl who had significant difficulty with food. Starting abruptly when she was 10 years old, she suffered unremitting symptoms ascribed to gastroenteritis. It had not been possible to identify an organic cause following detailed and extensive investigation. While much of the multidisciplinary clinical evidence pointed towards a behavioural component to her condition, some of the conventional indicators of anorexia nervosa were not considered to be present, and the court dealing with her case emphasised the necessity to keep an open mind as to her diagnosis. The behavioural aspect of her condition touched on other areas of her clinical management. That stark description of the compulsion to be employed in treating this 12 year old, separated from her family, is disheartening, spelling out severe interference with her freedom. The overall emphasis, ironically, is to return the girl to independence. Changes associated with different stages of the lifespan [Bernie Garrett](https://taylorandfrancis.com/search-results/?query=Bernie%2BGarrett&tab=books) in [Fluids and Electrolytes](https://www.routledge.com/isbn/10.1201/9781315157825), 2017 This chapter describes the general changes in fluid and electrolyte physiology across the lifespan. It compares and contrasts the fluid and electrolyte requirements in preterm babies, neonates, infants, children, adults, and older adults. The chapter outlines the three major buffering systems in the body. Fluid composition remains relatively constant in the body throughout the developmental stages, although the total body water changes throughout human development and also varies with body weight and sex. For pregnant women, fluid and electrolyte needs increase significantly to meet the needs of the growing fetus. A common and serious cause of fluid and electrolyte problems in infants is gastroenteritis. Fluid requirements in children are calculated based on body weight according to the Holliday-Segar method. Diabetes mellitus is a key example of a metabolic disorder having a significant impact on fluid balance. The fluid requirements of premature infants vary considerably depending on gestational age and birth weight. Systematic review of the rotavirus infection burden in the WHO-EMRO region Published in burden on low- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization defines the Eastern Mediterranean region (WHO-EMRO) as a diverse area in terms of socioeconomic status and health indicators. Rotavirus vaccination has been introduced, at least partially, in 19 out of the 22 EM countries; however, vaccine coverage remains low, and data on rotavirus disease burden is scarce. Available data on rotavirus prevalence, seasonality, vaccination status, and genotype evolution was systematically compiled following a literature review that identified 165 relevant WHO-EMRO epidemiology studies published between 1990 and 2017. Although the infectious agents responsible for acute gastroenteritis vary over time, rotavirus remained the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in children, as seen in 76.3% of reviewed publications. Younger children (<2 years old) were at higher risk and thus increased vaccination coverage and surveillance systems are required to reduce the rotavirus gastroenteritis burden in WHO-EMRO countries. Mucosal Immunity and acute viral gastroenteritis Published in [Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/KHVI), 2014 Acute gastroenteritis is a major killer of the very young worldwide. Rotavirus is the most common intestinal virus, causing acute gastroenteritis and extra-intestinal complications especially in young and chronically ill subjects. As early as 1991, the WHO recommended as high priority the development of a vaccine against rotavirus, the major pathogen causing enteric infections. Since the introduction of rotavirus vaccines for infant immunization programmes in different parts of the world in 2006, vaccination against rotavirus has resulted in substantial declines in severe gastroenteritis. The oral rotavirus vaccines RotaTeq\u00ae and Rotarix\u00ae are excellent examples for their unique features and principles of mucosal immunization. We elaborate on rotavirus immunity and the success of rotavirus vaccination and aspects also beyond infants' acute gastroenteritis. Rotavirus specific plasma secretory immunoglobulin in children with acute gastroenteritis and children vaccinated with an attenuated human rotavirus vaccine Published in detected in serum of naturally RV infected children and shown to reflect the intestinal Ig immune response. Total plasma SIgA and plasma RV-SIg were evaluated by ELISA in children with gastroenteritis due or not due to RV infection and in 50 children vaccinated with the attenuated RIX4414 human RV vaccine and 62 placebo recipients. RV-SIg was only detected in children with evidence of previous RV infection or with acute RV gastroenteritis. Vaccinees had higher RV-SIg titers than placebo recipients and RV-SIg titers increased after the second vaccine dose. RV-SIg measured after the second dose correlated with protection when vaccinees and placebo recipients were analyzed jointly. RV-SIg may serve as a valuable correlate of protection for RV vaccines.
