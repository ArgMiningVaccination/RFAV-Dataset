Use of complementary and alternative medicine has increased over the past decade. A variety of studies have suggested that this use is greater in persons with symptoms or diagnoses of anxiety and depression. Data support the effectiveness of some popular herbal remedies and dietary supplements; in some of these products, particularly kava, the potential for benefit seems greater than that for harm with short-term use in patients with mild to moderate anxiety. Inositol has been found to have modest effects in patients with panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Physicians should not encourage the use of St. John's wort, valerian, Sympathyl, or passionflower for the treatment of anxiety based on small or inconsistent effects in small studies. Although the evidence varies depending on the supplement and the anxiety disorder, physicians can collaborate with patients in developing dietary supplement strategies that minimize risks and maximize benefits. Use of complementary and alternative medicine in all of its varieties, such as herbal remedies and dietary supplements, increased from 34 percent of the overall U.S. population in 1990 to 42 percent in 1997. [1](#afp20070815p549-b1) Use appears to be twice as great in persons reporting anxiety and depression than in those reporting any other problem, except for back and neck pain. [1](#afp20070815p549-b1) Based on results of two large-scale community surveys, [2](#afp20070815p549-b2), [3](#afp20070815p549-b3) investigators have noted an association between both panic disorder and major depression and the use of complementary and alternative medicine. |Clinical recommendation||Evidence rating||References||Comments| |Short-term use of kava is recommended for patients with mild to moderate anxiety disorders who are not using alcohol or taking other medicines metabolized by the liver, but who wish to use \"natural\" remedies.||A|[24](#afp20070815p549-b24), [25](#afp20070815p549-b25) [26](#afp20070815p549-b26), [27](#afp20070815p549-b27) [26](#afp20070815p549-b26)but not scores; when added to SSRIs, inositol had no additional effect [27](#afp20070815p549-b27) [16](#afp20070815p549-b16)- [23](#afp20070815p549-b23) Currently, the preferred treatment for anxiety disorders is cognitive behavior therapy and pharmacologic agents. Beta blockers or benzodiazepines are used for time-limited and predictable anxiety disorders, whereas selective serotonin oxidase inhibitors are preferred for chronic or recurrent anxiety disorders. In recent years, studies using herbal remedies and supplements to treat mild to moderate anxiety disorders have emerged. It is important for physicians to recognize that supplements offer both benefits and risks. By doing so, they can avoid an overly dismissive attitude that discourages patients from disclosing their supplement use. At the same time, understanding the limits of available evidence allows physicians to collaborate with interested patients in developing dietary supplement strategies that minimize risks and maximize benefits. In this article, the supplements purported to ameliorate anxiety disorders are divided into three groups: herbal supplements, nutritional supplements, and neurotransmitter and hormonal precursors. These divisions are somewhat arbitrary in that all of the products are taken orally, are available over the counter, are marketed with a variety of health claims on the Internet, and are justified by their purported ultimate effects on the neurotransmitter systems that mediate worry, stress, or fatigue symptoms in patients with anxiety disorders. Information on supplements that claim to be useful or commonly used for anxiety disorders was obtained from several Internet sites, particularly [http://www.revolutionhealth.com/drugs-treatments](http://www.revolutionhealth.com/drugs-treatments), [http://www.healthyplace.com/Communities/Anxiety/treatment/alternative_treatment.asp](http://www.healthyplace.com/Communities/Anxiety/treatment/alternative_treatment.asp), and [http://www.naturaldatabase.com](http://www.naturaldatabase.com). Medline via Ovid was used to search for clinical trials, guidelines, and meta-analyses that tested or asserted the effectiveness of these preparations in the treatment of patients with diagnosed anxiety disorders. [Table 1](#afp20070815p549-t1) includes suggested supplements that have some evidence of effectiveness for treating anxiety. Only therapies with evidence of effectiveness are discussed in this review. |Type of evidence||Herbal supplements||Nutritional RCT||St. John's (for somatoform disorders), sympathyl (California poppy, hawthorn, elemental magnesium)||Inositol, 18 g (one RCT for panic disorder and one RCT for OCD)||5-hydroxytryptophan (serotonin for GAD), valerian||\u2014||\u2014| |Clinical noneffectiveness||Cannabis||Omega-3 fatty acids (as adjunct for treatment-resistant OCD)||\u2014| Patients often justify the use of certain preparations on the basis of irrelevant or misleading evidence; to help physicians recognize such preparations, those supplements with no clinical evidence of effectiveness in reducing anxiety are presented in [Table 2](#afp20070815p549-t2). Clearly, the vast majority of supplements with purported anxiolytic effects have no evidence of clinical systematic review identified 12 RCTs of effects of kava on patients with GAD|[4](#afp20070815p549-b4); the authors concluded that kava taken for one to 24 weeks was safe and mildly effective; the replication [5](#afp20070815p549-b5)allowed more comparisons between patient subgroups and suggested most improvement effects in women and patients younger than 53 years [6](#afp20070815p549-b6)with treatments typically lasting four weeks [7](#afp20070815p549-b7)have shown effectiveness, a 25-week study [8](#afp20070815p549-b8)showed that therapeutic effects started in the eighth week [9](#afp20070815p549-b9)and improved understanding of the pharmacologic substances in kava [10](#afp20070815p549-b10)show that its safety compares favorably with FDA-approved treatments for anxiety disorders [10](#afp20070815p549-b10) [11](#afp20070815p549-b11); later, research suggested that nonstandard inclusion of the kava plant's bark in kava preparations increased toxicity level [12](#afp20070815p549-b12) Kava dramatically inhibits the cytochrome P450 enzyme used by the liver to metabolize many medications, potentially altering the potency of these other medications. [13](#afp20070815p549-b13), [14](#afp20070815p549-b14) Thus, it is important to be aware of the risk of drug interactions with kava. Other side effects reported with long-term use include a reversible skin rash or lesion and a yellow tint to the skin, but these reports have not been routine. Despite the absence of long-term data on safety and effectiveness, [4](#afp20070815p549-b4), [13](#afp20070815p549-b13), [15](#afp20070815p549-b15) the evidence shows that short-term use (i.e., up to 24 weeks) can lead to small improvements in generalized anxiety, [4](#afp20070815p549-b4) and that short-term risks do not outweigh the benefits. For patients with mild to moderate anxiety who wish to use \"natural\" remedies and are not using alcohol or taking other medications that are metabolized by the liver, kava appears to be acceptable for short-term use. ST. JOHN'S WORT St. John's wort is a popular supplement for treating depression but is much less popular for treating anxiety disorders. Studies specifically testing the effects of St. John's wort on patients with anxiety are extremely limited. [Table 4](#afp20070815p549-t4) summarizes the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of St. John's wort in the treatment of anxiety disorders. [16](#afp20070815p549-b16)- [23](#afp20070815p549-b23) |Design||Description||Comments| |RCT with St. John's wort in OCD||Compared 30 patients with OCD taking LI 160 extract (range: 300 to 1,800 mg) and 30 patients with OCD taking placebo for 12 weeks|[17](#afp20070815p549-b17); the compound used was a 450-mg, extended-release formulation of 0.3% Hypericum taken two times a week [18](#afp20070815p549-b18); St. John's wort had no effect in reducing anxiety scores [19](#afp20070815p549-b19); after patients with significant depressive symptoms were excluded, 150 patients were randomized to St. John's wort or placebo; dosage of the LI 160 extract was 300 mg twice a day [20](#afp20070815p549-b20) [21](#afp20070815p549-b21); no differences between valerian and placebo, or between diazepam and placebo [22](#afp20070815p549-b22); Sympathyl (n = 130) and placebo (n = 134) groups were relatively large; after three months the Sympathyl group showed a 10.6-point decline in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale score, whereas the placebo group showed an 8.9-point decline [23](#afp20070815p549-b23); both groups started with mean Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores of 20 and ended with significant reductions to 6; the groups also had the same level of side effects The evidence of positive effects of St. John's wort on anxiety disorders is weak. No placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trials have shown St. John's wort to be effective in treating generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or phobias. The only effective trial involved patients with somatoform disorder, although the relationship between somatoform disorder and anxiety is complex. Much stronger evidence is needed before St. John's wort should be considered a treatment option for patients with diagnosable anxiety disorders. HAWTHORN AND CALIFORNIA POPPY A single French study exists of a combination product called Sympathyl, [22](#afp20070815p549-b22) which contains 20 mg California poppy, 75 mg hawthorn, and 75 mg elemental magnesium. According to the study, Sympathyl had a very small but positive effect on anxiety. No clinical trials suggest that any of the individual components reduce anxiety in patients with anxiety disorders. VALERIAN Although valerian is often cited as having anxiolytic effects and has been used for centuries by herbalists/physicians to treat nervousness, there are only two small trials involving valerian, neither of which produced clear indications of effectiveness ( [Table 4](#afp20070815p549-t4) [16](#afp20070815p549-b16)- [23](#afp20070815p549-b23) ). Thus, at the present time, there is no clinical evidence of an anxiolytic effect of valerian when compared with placebo in patients with anxiety disorder. PASSIONFLOWER A single randomized double-blind trial compared 45 drops of passionflower tincture per day to 30 mg per day of oxazepam (Serax; brand no longer available in the United States) for 30 days. [23](#afp20070815p549-b23) Investigators noted a marked reduction in anxiety score in both groups, but without a placebo group it was unclear whether other aspects of the milieu could have caused the effects. Nutritional Supplements Despite the number of nutritional supplements purported on the Internet to treat anxiety, only inositol, part of the vitamin B complex (B8) and an intracellular second messenger, has evidence suggesting superiority to placebo and even comparability with the SSRI fluvoxamine (Luvox; brand no longer available in the United States). [Table 5](#afp20070815p549-t5) summarizes the evidence supporting the effectiveness and safety of inositol in managing anxiety disorders. [24](#afp20070815p549-b24)- [27](#afp20070815p549-b27) Inositol appears to have a positive effect on patients with panic disorder; however, its effect on patients with OCD is less clear. Physicians should inform patients that the limited data that exist to date suggest partial responses with a side-effect profile that may be comparable with that of SSRIs. |Design||Description||Comments| |RCT crossover with placebo in panic disorder||Twenty-one patients with panic disorder were randomly assigned to 6 g of inositol or placebo twice a day for four weeks and then switched to the other substance|[25](#afp20070815p549-b25); each crossover phase lasted four weeks (dosage: inositol, 18 g per day, or fluvoxamine, 150 mg per day); the four-week intervals were separated by a one-week placebo washout period; overall, both drugs reduced panic attack frequency and intensity, anxiety scale scores, and clinical global improvement scores; no meaningful clinical differences were noted between the two drugs [26](#afp20070815p549-b26); 13 patients with OCD who had failed SSRI or clomipramine (Anafranil) treatments or who could not tolerate their side effects used 18 g per day of inositol or placebo for consecutive six-week treatment intervals; inositol produced significant reductions in Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale scores (4.6) compared with the placebo condition (0.3); reductions in Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores were not significantly different [27](#afp20070815p549-b27); 13 patients with OCD who had not responded adequately to fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine, or clomipramine for at least eight weeks were given consecutive six-week trials on 18 g per day of inositol or placebo, in addition to the SSRI medication; inositol provided no additional benefit Neurotransmitter Or Hormonal Precursors The anxiolytic neurotransmitter or hormonal precursors with some evidence of effectiveness are shown in [Table 1](#afp20070815p549-t1). The vast majority of neurotransmitter or hormonal precursors that claim to be useful for treating anxiety disorders have no evidence supporting clinical utility. Only 5-hydroxytryptophan appeared to show clinical effectiveness among the precursor preparations. [Table 6](#afp20070815p549-t6) summarizes the available evidence relevant to the effectiveness and safety of 5-hydroxytryptophan. [28](#afp20070815p549-b28), [29](#afp20070815p549-b29) |Design||Description||Comments| |RCT in panic disorder||Patients with panic disorder (n = 24) exposed to a panic-inducing carbon dioxide challenge were given a single dose of 5-hydroxytryptophan (200 mg) or placebo before exposure|[29](#afp20070815p549-b29); the clomipramine and 5-hydroxytryptophan were titrated from 25 mg a day to a maximum of 150 mg per day; the clomipramine group showed significant reductions in Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores compared with placebo, whereas the 5-hydroxytryptophan group showed modest, nonsignificant improvements Although there is some indication that 5-hydroxytryptophan can reduce anxiety symptoms among patients with anxiety disorders, the evidence is weak. Also, it has been known to cause eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome, a significantly dangerous side effect. Therefore, the risk/benefit ratio does not favor physician support of patients choosing this medication because it is \"natural.\" Key Recommendations for Physicians Because use of herbal remedies is increasing, it is important for family physicians to ask their patients about such use. Encouraging data support the effectiveness of some of these products, particularly kava and, to a lesser degree, inositol. Although none of these supplements or products are free of adverse effects, the potential for benefit seems greater than the risk of harm. The existing data show that the popular supplements St. John's wort, valerian, and omega-3 fatty acids have little therapeutic value for anxiety disorders, and their use should be discouraged in favor of more effective treatments. In addition, many preparationsthat might be used by patients to reduce anxiety lack evidence of effectiveness with anxiety disorders. The availability of natural treatments that are supported by clinical evidence and the recognition of those that are not will help physicians collaborate with patients using or seeking natural remedies to maximize the potential for benefit and minimize the potential for harm.
