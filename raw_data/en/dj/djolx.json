On National Women's Checkup Day, Dr. Joseph Sciabbarrasi will be speaking to women about using this innovative approach to women's health issues. Los Angeles (PRWeb via PRWeb) April 29, 2008 -- In honor of National Women's Health Week, Joseph Sciabbarrasi, M.D. will be presenting a free lecture for women, ''Understanding Hormone Replacement Therapy,'' on May 12, 2008, 6:30 - 8:30 pm. The seminar addresses the escalating rise in women in their 40 and 50's who are suffering from a variety of pre-menopausal symptoms which are often misunderstood and misdiagnosed. Many women are told that this is a normal process of aging, that these problems are to be expected and that this is as good as it gets. Dr. Sciabbarrasi, who is a specialist in women's health and bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, is offering an alternative. One patient, Diane Brooke, said it clearly, \"I'm tired of feeling bad.\" As a 53 year old customer service executive, mother of two, also caring for an aging parent, she had consulted her internal medicine specialist. She had a full exam and laboratory testing and was told all of her results were normal. \"I was becoming terribly depressed. My joints ached and felt stiff, it was hard to concentrate and stay focused. I was waking up several times nightly to urinate and having difficulty returning to sleep. I felt anxious for no reason and was becoming absentminded over things I should easily remember. For the first time in my life I felt old. Worst of all, my libido and interest in sex was gone, along with my energy.\" But instead of seeing a psychiatrist, Diane chose a completely different path. Through a friend's recommendation she sought out a holistic doctor in Los Angeles for bioidentical hormone replacement therapy . \"Normal exams and labs are the rule and not the exception,\" says Dr. Sciabbarrasi, a graduate of George Washington University School of Medicine and a practitioner of a new branch of medical care called holistic and integrative medicine. \"Labs and exams could not measure Diane's true situation. Her symptoms were very consistent with the common hormonal problems women experience before and during menopause.\" In addition to Diane's symptoms, many women experience weight gain, night sweats, vaginal dryness, hair loss and mood swings. In Diane's case, a woman who was an efficient, skillful manager of her personal and professional life had steadily become overwhelmed by daily living. Under Dr. Sciabbarrasi's supervision, specialized lab testing was performed which showed hormonal deficiencies which explained her symptoms. \"I found out my symptoms were real, not all in my head. And treatment was available.\" Women from every culture, race and walk of life struggle with these problems as they age. Integrative medical doctors combine conventional testing with more innovative approaches to chronic conditions such as acupuncture, nutrition, intravenous vitamins , homeopathy - and bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. Bioidentical hormones are exactly the same hormones that our bodies produce. \"We use these instead of synthetic hormones because they have great benefit with a much lower incidence of side PRWeb eBooks - Another online visibility tool from PRWebeffects,\" Dr. Sciabbarrasi explains. While they are beneficial, Sciabbarrasi does not think they are a panacea. He emphasizes adequate sleep, dietary modification, exercise, supplements, and living a life in balance. Dr. Sciabbarrasi also offers chelation therapy for toxic metals , neurotransmitter evaluation and intracellular nutrient and antioxidant analysis. Since opening his practice with these different therapies, Dr. Sciabbarrasi has seen and helped thousands of women - many with the same problems as Diane faced. Within her first month of treatment, Diane was already sleeping much better. Four months later, she was beaming. \"I can't believe how much better I feel. I felt out of control, crying - almost completely gone away. Now I enjoy life again.\" Women of all ages are encouraged to spend National Women's Checkup Day checking out Dr. Sciabbarrasi's free lecture on Monday, May 12, 2008, 6:30 - 8:30 pm at the Westside Pavilion, 10800 W.
