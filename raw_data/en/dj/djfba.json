From 1 September 2023, all newly eligible individuals will be offered 2 doses of the non-live shingles vaccine Shingrix\u00ae instead of Zostavax\u00ae. In addition to this, the eligibility for the immunocompromised and immunocompetent cohorts will change to allow individuals to be protected at an earlier age. This is based on [recommendations](https://app.box.com/s/iddfb4ppwkmtjusir2tc/file/424913874479) from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Although shingles can occur at any age, the risk and severity of shingles and its complications increases with age and is high in individuals who are immunosuppressed. It is important to ensure that those at greatest risk are vaccinated at an earlier age and this forms the basis of the JCVI recommendations. This letter is aimed at health professionals who are responsible for commissioning and operationally delivering the national NHS shingles vaccination programme. We encourage you to share this guidance with all those involved in delivering the programme in your area. Key points about the changes to the programme Change of vaccine - Shingrix\u00ae will replace Zostavax\u00ae for the whole shingles programme - Shingrix\u00ae will require a 2-dose schedule for all cohorts. The dosing interval will differ for immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients - Shingrix\u00ae should be offered to all people reaching eligible age on or after 1 September 2023. Those cohorts previously eligible for Zostavax\u00ae who are under 80 years of age, should continue to be offered Zostavax\u00ae until central stocks deplete (via ImmForm), after which they should be offered Shingrix\u00ae - individuals who have received Zostavax\u00ae previously should not be revaccinated with Shingrix\u00ae - Shingrix\u00ae can be administered alongside other vaccines. Please refer to the [Shingles Green Book chapter](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shingles-herpes-zoster-the-green-book-chapter-28a)for more information - in 2018, it was agreed that patients could be immunised with shingles vaccine at any point in the year as soon as they reach eligible age. Shingles vaccination should continue to be offered year-round Changes to eligibility Immunocompromised cohort Since September 2021, Shingrix\u00ae has been available to immunocompromised individuals aged 70 to 79 years, who are contraindicated to receive Zostavax\u00ae, as part of the NHS shingles vaccination programme. The forthcoming change from 1 September 2023 will expand the eligibility to all immunocompromised individuals aged 50 years and over (with no upper age limit). Immunocompromised individuals who have already received 2 doses of Shingrix\u00ae do not need re-vaccination. Immunocompromised individuals represent the highest priority for vaccination given their risk of severe disease, and therefore the programme aims to catch up all immunocompromised individuals aged 50 years and over in the first year of the programme implementation. The second dose should be given 8 weeks to 6 months after the first dose for this cohort, in line with the [Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/12054/smpc). Immunocompetent cohort The eligible age for immunocompetent individuals will change from 70 to 60 years of age for the routine cohort, in a phased implementation over a 10 year period. The routine offer will move from 70 to 60 years of age in 2 stages over a 10 year period as follows: During stage 1 (1 September 2023 to 31 August 2028) Shingrix\u00ae will be offered to those turning 70 and 65 years on or after 1 September 2023. Zostavax\u00ae will be offered to persons aged between 70 to 79 that were eligible for the vaccination programme before 1 September 2023. Once all stocks of Zostavax\u00ae are exhausted, these individuals can be offered Shingrix\u00ae if they have not previously been given a shingles vaccine. During stage 2 (1 September 2028 to 31 August 2033) Shingrix\u00ae will be offered to those turning 65 and 60 years of age. From 1 September 2033 and thereafter, Shingrix\u00ae will be offered routinely at age 60 years. Those who have been previously eligible ( in stages 1 and 2) will remain eligible until their 80th birthday.

However, where an individual has turned 80 years of age following their first dose of Shingrix\u00ae, a second dose should be provided before the individual's 81st birthday to complete the course. For immunocompetent individuals the second dose can be given 6 to 12 months after the first dose.

For clinical queries or queries about supporting programme resources, please email [immunisation@ukhsa.gov.uk](mailto:immunisation@ukhsa.gov.uk). The [annual shingles vaccine coverage data](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/herpes-zoster-shingles-immunisation-programme-2021-to-2022-evaluation-reports) for the 8th year of the programme in England (financial year 2021 to 2022) shows that cumulative vaccine coverage for each birth cohort continues to increase each year. This latest data suggests recovery of the programme in 2021 to 2022 after the programme was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the year prior. Results assessing the [impact of shingles vaccination](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32641364/) in the 5 years after the introduction of the programme in England showed large reductions in both GP consultations and hospitalisations for herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia. Therefore, it is important to continue to offer the shingles vaccine to all eligible patients, particularly in regions with lower coverage and those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved in commissioning and operationally delivering the national NHS shingles vaccination programme. Yours sincerely, Deborah Tomalin, Director of Public Health Commissioning and Operations, NHS England Dr Mary Ramsay CBE, Director of Public Health Programmes (including immunisation), UK Health Security Agency Annexe A: information and guidance for healthcare professionals The recommendations of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) In February 2019, based on impact and cost effectiveness modelling, the [JCVI recommended](https://app.box.com/s/iddfb4ppwkmtjusir2tc/file/424913874479) that the national shingles immunisation programme be changed such that Shingrix\u00ae is offered to immunocompetent individuals routinely at 60 years of age, and to immunocompromised individuals aged 50 years old and over. JCVI further advised a catch-up of 60 to 70 year olds that should be implemented in stages, starting with vaccination of those turning 65 and 70 years old for 5 years, then moving to vaccination of those turning 60 and 65 years old for 5 years, following which time vaccination could then be routinely offered to those turning 60 years old. The advice was based on the high efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Shingrix\u00ae observed in clinical trials. Evidence suggests that Shingrix\u00ae provides a substantially longer duration of protection from shingles than Zostavax\u00ae. Timing and eligibility The changes to the programme should be implemented from 1 September 2023 including the offer of Shingrix\u00ae to all newly eligible cohorts and the change to eligibility. For the immunocompromised, the earliest eligible age will move down to 50 years and the eligible cohort will include all those aged 50 years and over (that is, for the immunocompromised cohort there is no upper age limit). For the immunocompetent, the change to the eligible age will be implemented in a phased manner, in 2 5-year stages. During stage 1 (1 September 2023 to 31 August 2028) Shingrix\u00ae will be offered to those turning 70 and 65 years on or after 1 September 2023. Individuals will remain eligible until their 80th birthday. Anyone aged 65 to 69 before 1 September 2023 will not be eligible for shingles vaccination until they turn 70 years of age. Zostavax\u00ae will be offered to persons aged between 70 to 79 that were eligible for the vaccination programme before 1 September 2023. Once all stocks of Zostavax\u00ae are exhausted, these individuals can be offered Shingrix\u00ae if they have not previously been given a shingles vaccine. During stage 2 (1 September 2028 to 31 August 2033) Shingrix\u00ae will be offered to those turning 65 and 60 years of age. From 1 September 2033 and thereafter, Shingrix\u00ae will be offered routinely at age 60 years. Those who have been previously eligible ( in stages 1 and 2) will remain eligible until their 80th birthday. This is set out in the [Immunocompetent patients - timeline for the phased implementation of the change to eligible age table](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shingles-vaccination-programme-changes-from-september-2023-letter). Vaccine supply Shingrix\u00ae will be available to order online via the [ImmForm website](https://portal.immform.phe.gov.uk/Logon.aspx). See the [ImmForm helpsheet](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-register-immform-helpsheet-8) for information on registering for an ImmForm account. Ordering controls may be in place to enable the UK Health Security Agency ( UKHSA) to balance incoming supply with demand. Details on ordering will be available on ImmForm and in Vaccine Update in due course. Please make sure that local stocks of vaccine are rotated in fridges so that wastage is minimised. It is recommended that practices hold no more than 2 weeks' worth of stock. Locally held stocks of Shingrix\u00ae ordered via ImmForm for the previous shingles immunocompromised programme can be used for eligible cohorts in the expanded programme. Zostavax\u00ae will remain available through ImmForm until central stocks deplete. Zostavax\u00ae can continue to be offered to those cohorts previously eligible for Zostavax\u00ae who are under 80 years of age, after which time they should receive Shingrix\u00ae. Funding and service arrangements All routine NHS-funded vaccinations and immunisations are an essential service under the GP Contract. From the 1 September 2023, the Shingles vaccination programme will be expanded and move to a 2-dose Shingrix\u00ae vaccine, as set out in the letter above. Practices will be required to undertake call/recall for patients in the immunocompetent and immunocompromised cohorts as they become eligible for the programme from September 2023, and catch-up call/recall for the newly eligible immunocompromised patients aged 50 to 69 years in the first year of the revised programme. Practices will need to administer Shingrix\u00ae (2-dose schedule) to patients in both the immunocompromised and immunocompetent cohort who become eligible from 1 September 2023. For those in the immunocompromised cohort the second dose is to be administered 8 weeks to 6 months after the first dose, and for those in the immunocompetent cohort the second dose is to be administered between 6 to 12 months after the first dose. Practices will need to administer Zostavax\u00ae (1-dose schedule) to patients in the immunocompetent cohort who were eligible prior to 1 September 2023 until stocks deplete ( the current routine 70 to 79 year cohort eligible on or before 31 August 2023). Practices will receive a payment of \u00a310.06 per dose administered. Accurate and timely recording of all vaccines given, and good management of all associated documentation, is essential as per the standards set out in the GMS Regulations and Statement of Financial Entitlement (SFE). Shingrix\u00ae can be administered alongside other vaccines, which may increase opportunities to make an opportunistic offer. Unlike influenza vaccination, shingles vaccination is not seasonal and should be offered year-round. Please refer to the [Shingles Green Book chapter](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shingles-herpes-zoster-the-green-book-chapter-28a) for more information. Patient Group Directions (PGDs) An updated Shingrix\u00ae PGD template will be produced by UKHSA for NHS England areas to authorise for their commissioned services. This will be available from the [PGD collection](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/immunisation-patient-group-direction-pgd) on GOV.UK. Information and guidance for healthcare practitioners Detailed clinical guidance on shingles and shingles vaccination is contained in [chapter 28a](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shingles-herpes-zoster-the-green-book-chapter-28a) of Immunisation Against Infectious Disease (the Green Book). Healthcare practitioner information and guidance to support the Shingrix\u00ae programme including e-learning and a training slide set will be available on the [Shingles vaccination guidance for healthcare practitioners webpage](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shingles-vaccination-guidance-for-healthcare-professionals).

Annexe B: vaccine coverage data collection Dose one and dose 2 coverage of the Shingrix\u00ae vaccination will be collected. GP practice-level shingles vaccine coverage will be based on data automatically uploaded via participating GP IT suppliers to the ImmForm website (a website used by the UKHSA and NHS to collect data on vaccine coverage and provide vaccine ordering facilities for the NHS) on a monthly basis for the first 12 months where after it will be a quarterly collection. From September 2023 data will be collected on the following: For the immunocompromised cohort Denominator: The number of individuals aged 50 years old and over (no upper age limit) registered at a GP practice who have a SNOMED code that indicates their immunocompromised status. Numerator: The number of individuals aged 50 years old and over (no upper age limit) registered at a GP practice who have a SNOMED code that indicates their immunocompromised status and have the following SNOMED codes: (a) 39756611000001109, 39655511000001105, 38737511000001105 or 38736811000001106 (indicating receipt of first dose of Shingrix\u00ae) (b) 1326111000000107 (indicating receipt of second dose of Shingrix\u00ae). For the immunocompetent cohort Denominator: The number of individuals aged 65 to 79 years old registered at a GP practice. Numerator: The number of individuals aged 65 to 79 years old registered at a GP practice.
