Simpson", "date": null, "cleaned_text": "Whitney is trained to offer Christ-centered energy work using the Usui Method of Natural Healing. This ancient healing art involves intercessory prayer using gentle touch guided by the energy/nerve centers of the body through which energy flows, similar to acupressure, acupuncture, healing touch, and therapeutic touch taught in nursing schools across the world. It complements medical treatment, psychological counseling, and massage therapy in a growing number of medical facilities. Whitney is fascinated by the healing benefits of energy work and also completed her 300-hour yoga teacher training focused on the subtle energy body. The gentleness of energy work using the Usui Method of Natural Healing (also known as Traditional Reiki) makes it effective with persons who are pregnant, dealing with illnesses such as cancer, recovering from surgery, or in hospice care. Reiki is also a great companion to not only your physical care but also your spiritual care. Reiki is a Japanese word that means universal life force energy. It was made known in the early 1900's thanks to a Japanese teacher and lay monk, Dr. Mikao Usui, who taught religion and spirituality, including Christian theology to his students. Imbalances in your energy flow may cause illness, stress, pain, or simply a difficult day. By balancing your energy flow naturally, your own body is better able to deal with challenges to the body, mind and spirit that may arise in your daily life. Results vary but this type of soul care often includes deep relaxation, a sense of calm, or deep sleep. You can experience the magnificent God given energy of your very own body through healing prayer and the Usui Method of Natural Healing. Whitney is a trained Reiki Master using the Usui Method of Natural Healing. Whitney was trained and mentored by Rev. Jo Reece, Ordained Deacon in the United Methodist Church and has continued her studies since Rev. Reece's retirement. Her training lineage is as follows: Dr. Mikao Dr. Furman Mary McDaniel Rev.
