WORK EXPERIENCE 1993-1995 Doctor for General Practice at Police General Hospital 1993-1995 Doctor for General Practice at Police General Hospital 1997-2007 Holistic Medical Consultant of Mission Health Promotion Center 2008 to present ; Holistic Health Consultant, Medical Doctor 4.0 Dr. Songsaeng Karnchanavisitphol, is a doctor, experienced in regenerative and anti-aging medicine. She had been both doctor and patient, but more of that story later. She also has extensive experience in other areas such as acupuncture, traditional Thai medicine, traditional German medicine, and choose to specialize in Natural Therapy and Regenerative Medicine for over 2 decades now. Her starting point for studying Regenerative Medicine was when she had tested positive for cervical cancer. Her then doctor recommended radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, Dr. Songsaeng did not agree with the recommended treatment mentioned. She did not wish to be treated through these pathways. Thus, she started to study survival medicine and self-healing treatment methods with herbs and other natural medicaments. Through her experience, she has always advised the following to her patients: Even though if one has chosen a treatment pathway, many may still not feel fully confident in the selected method. Therefore, it is extremely important to find out or learn more about your own condition and the treatment of choice. Take the opportunity to learn about the success rate of such treatments from actual testimonies and data available. Another extremely important factor is to get proper advice from a physician who has had direct experience handling such cases. Like Dr. Songsaeng, she is the living testimony for her own treatment pathway the proven benefit on herself and her patients. Treatment is not limited to a time or place Dr. Songsaeng has dedicated herself to the in-depth study of alternative medicine. She focused on understanding the rationales and principles behind each and every treatment plus the benefits it brings about. For instance, in traditional Chinese Medicine, apparatus such as acupuncture needles are compact and can easily be carried around all the time and can be extremely useful in times of emergency. This scenario actually happened to Dr. Songsaeng while she was on her way to Germany for a medical event. She encountered a victim with a critical heart condition on the plane. Two European-based doctors made an initial examination and stated that nothing could be done and that the aircraft needs to make an emergency stopover so that the patient could be taken to the nearest hospital for treatment. Dr. Songsaeng who specializes in acupuncture and regenerative medicine managed the patient en route by maintaining the respiratory system. The patient was stabilized, survived the ordeal, and was taken to a hospital for treatment safely. Another unexpected incident happened during the German trip. A six-year-old child turned blue with pneumonia during mid-flight. Dr. Songsaeng managed to save the child's life by soaking feet in warm water, massaging palms and soles, and regulating breathing until the child's symptom eases. With another 3 hours remaining in the flight and without proper first aid, the child might have lost his life. Dr. Songsaeng related a personal event: \"When her father was 61, he suddenly became unconscious. His heart suddenly stopped beating. He was then rushed to the hospital. The doctors found that he had severe heart conditions due to coronary arteries blockage and clogged arteries. The doctors recommended urgent heart surgery, but she disagreed. She then decided to start him on chelation therapy instead. After 10 sessions, he was healthier. He was able to walk without feeling fatigued. After 30 sessions, her father grew even stronger and was able to carry out his daily activities of living. He had an excellent quality of life all the way to the ripe age of 84.\" Apart from the stories related above, she has had plenty more positively proven successes treating patients through her personalized medicinal approach. Her treatment successes made her confident that integrative medicine approaches such as chelation, acupuncture, and others can significantly improve patients' conditions. Every treatment is a unique Clinically, Dr. Songsaeng starts by focuses on making the patients comfortable and relaxed so that they can gradually open up and discuss deeper about their lives and the problem that may cause the disease. From there, Dr. Songsaeng would gradually seek out the actual cause of the disease, as well as environmental factors such as nutrition and lifestyle. She will then do an in-depth analysis of the potential causes and lay out a treatment plan that target the exact needs of the patient. Dr. Songsaeng's guiding principle in treating patients is that every piece of information given to patients must be based on advice rather than enforcement. Every patient needs to gradually learn and integrate information received so that it can benefit their health. Thus, patients can apply the advice given their way, in a balanced manner, by adjusting their lifestyles, environmental factors, and attitudes, to achieve their health goals. Patient feedback Through the years, Dr. Songsaeng has had plenty of patients and many success stories. She received plenty of praised recommendations and feedbacks. The overall comments given are as follows: \"Dr. Songsaeng provides genuinely holistic treatment, paying attention to every aspect of the patient as well as their families or caregivers. She emphasizes giving knowledge and creating understanding to provide care for the patient. In addition, she also is an expert in providing highly effective German injectable treatment programs. She would delicately administer the doses her own, instead of relying on her subordinates and that is why patients say that the doctor has 'healing hands\".
