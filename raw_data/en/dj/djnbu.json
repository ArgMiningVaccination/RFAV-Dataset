SACKLER, BEVERLY SACKLER, ) DAVID SACKLER, ILENE SACKLER LEFCOURT, ) PETER BOER, PAULO CECIL PICKETT, ) RALPH ) _____________________________________________________ ) THE COMMONWEALTH 'S PRE-HEARING MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEARING SET FOR JANUARY 25, 2019 The Commonwealth respectfully submits this memorandum in advance of the hearing set for January 25, 2019. At the last hearing, on December 21, 2018, the Court considered motions to impound by Purdue (Purdue Pharma LP and Purdue Pharma Inc.) and by the Chief Executive Officer defendants (John Stewart, Mark Timney, and Craig Landau) filed on December 20, 2018. At the conclusion of that hearing, the Court: 1) ordered the Commonwealth to file an impounded, unredacted version of its Amended Complaint as well as a redacted version for the public file; 2) provisionally granted the CEO defendants ' motion to impound information relating to their compensation; 3) set a January 25, 2019 conference for the parties to update the Court on the status of the parties ' efforts to resolve the issues presented by the redactions, discuss next steps, and%oJAhj j i 2 provide the public an opportunit y to be heard with respect to t he redactions; and 4) invited the parties to file me moranda to assist the Court in na vigating remaining issues. In advance of the hearing on Ja nuary 25, the Commonwealth files this memorandum to update the Court on the status of the redaction dispute and pro pose next steps for resolving the remaining disputes with in this proceeding. I. Status of the Redaction Dispute The parties have a shared interest in avoiding unnecessary co nflicts between the federal multi-district litigation and s tate proceedings and, accordingl y, they have worked in good faith to narrow the scope of the redaction dispute. On December 20, 201 8, the Commonwealth notified Purdue, pursuant to the relevant provision in th e MDL Protectiv e Order, that it challenged Purdue's confidentiality designations for all allegations in th e Amended Complaint. Through the process that followed, Purdue a greed to lift hundreds of redact ions. On January 10, in accordance with the MDL procedures, the Commo nwealth notified Purdue that it would challenge t he remaining redactions before MDL Special Master Cathy Yanni. On January 14, the Commonwealth submitted its challenge to Special Master Yanni for every redaction that remains. The Commonwealth's letter brief to Special Master Yanni is attached hereto as Exhibit 1. Pur due asked that its letter bri ef to the Special Master be due January 22, and the Special Maste r granted that request. The S pecial Master may provide a ruling that further reduces the number of items in dispute. Th e Commonwealth i s providing the Special Master with a copy of thi s Pre-hearing Memorandum today . On January 10 and 11, counsel for D efendants Richard Sackler an d Russell Gasdia contacted the Commonwealth reg arding redactions. In the discus sions that followed, they asked the Commonwealth to maintai n redactions in paragraph 370 and pa ragraphs 699-753 to allow 3 further time to confer. A list of the remaining redactio ns and an updated version of th e Amended Complaint showing the remaining redactions a re attached as Exhibit 2 and Exhibit 3. II. Proposed Next Steps A. Order Purdue to Produce the Docu ments Cited in the Amended Comp laint in this Proceeding and Set a Schedule for Proper Briefing on Impou ndment The Court-permitted, temporary im poundment has enabled the part ies to engage in the MDL Court's procedure for narro wing discovery disputes and that process remains ongoing. Now the Court and the parties should prepare to turn to the que stion of the propriety, under Massachusetts law, of continui ng to withhold from public view s omething that is ordinarily considered to be a matter of public record, i.e., the remaining, redacted allegations in the Commonwealth's Amended Complaint. As the Court observed during the December 21 hearing, this Cour t is not bound by confidentiality designations m ade to facilitate discovery. Ins tead, as the Protective Order submitted by the parties and entered by this Court (Kaplan, J.) on Oct. 22, 2018 states, upon a motion to impound materials in the public record, the Court mus t apply the Uniform Rules of Impoundment Procedure.1 To find good cause for impoundment , Rule 7(b) requires the Co urt to \"consider all relevant facto rs, including, but not limited to, (i) the nature of t he parties and the controversy, (ii) th e type of information and the privacy inter ests involved, (iii) the extent of community interest, (iv ) constitutional ri ghts, and (v) the rea son(s) for the request.\" 1 See Oct. 22, 2018 Protective Order, par. 12 (\"[T]he Court is not bo und by the designation of any material as \"Confidential\" or \"Highly Conf idential\" and any such designatio n shall not create any pres umption that documents so designated are entitled to con fidential treatment pursuant t o Mass. R. Civ. P. 26(c) or impoundment pursuant to the Uniform Rules of Impoundment Procedure. If the Court deter mines that the Confidential Materials or Highly Confidential Materials are not e ntitled to confidential treatme nt and/or does not permit the documents which contain such Confidential Materials or H ighly Confidential Materials to be filed under seal, the p arties may then file those pleadings or other documents in open court.\") 4 Impoundment is the exception ra ther than the rule, and denying the public access to judicial records should be \"strictly cons trued in favor of the general p rinciple of publicity.\" Republican Co. v. Appeals Court , 442 Mass. 218, 223 (2004), quoting Commonwealth v. Blondin , 324 Mass. 564, 571 (1949), cert. denied , 339 U.S. 984 (1950). In light of Purdue's contention that documents the Commonwealth obtained pursuant to MDL Protective Order par. 33(l) a re not subject to this Court's jurisdiction \u2014 a position in direct conflict with Purdue's earlier a greement that such documents \"s hall be governed by this [Court's Protective] Order\"2 \u2014 the Commonwealth proposes tha t the Court order Purdue, by Ma rch 1, to produce in this litigation copi es of the documents cited in the Amended Complaint; and, by March 15, to serve upon the Commonw ealth a fully-supported, spe cific motion to impound any allegations that Purdue seeks to withhold from the public. With respect to the proposal th at Purdue produce the documents cited in the Amended Complaint, the burden on Purdue i s low. A list of the document s cited is attached as Exhibit 4. There are fewer than 600 documents at issue, and Purdue has alr eady reviewed them for privilege and produced them in the MDL and, in some instances, in other proceedings. The relevance of the documents to the Commonwealth's allegations is high: the reason Purdue seeks to redact the Amended Complaint allegations is because they are based on those documents. It would be reasonable for Purdue t o produce the documents in this litigation. After Purdue produces the documents in this litigation, there would be no fe deral-state complications and no obstacle to providing the most c omplete public access provided by Massachusetts law. Purdue 2 See id. at par. 5 (\"To the extent that a Producing Party produces disco very materials in th is action that were designated as \"Confidential\" or \"Highly Confidential\" in In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation , Case No. 17-MD-2804 (N.D. Oh.) or the Commonwealth obtains such material s pursuant to \u00b6 33(l) of Case Management Order No. 2: Protective Order (Docket No. 441) therein, those d iscovery materials are d eemed \"Confidential\" or \"Highly Confidential\" under this Order and shall be governed by this Order.\") 5 should produce the documents by March 1. With respect to the proposal that Purdue properly brief its Mot ion to Impound, the Commonwealth contends that Purdu e has not yet filed a motion ad dressing the specific information to be impounded as the Uniform Rules of Impoundment require. The Commonwealth anticipates stre nuously opposing Purdue's motion. The Attorney General is the Commonwealth's lawyer, and the p eople of Massachusetts should b e allowed to see the allegations brought on their beha lf. The Defendants' deceptive sales tactics injured people across the Commonwealth, and the p eople of Massachusetts deserv e to know the truth. This Court has the responsibility of presiding over th is litigation \u2014 likely including ruling on Defendants' motions to dismiss th e Amended Complaint that is st ill not fully public \u2014 and the people should have the fullest opportunity to access this proce eding under Massachusetts law. Purdue's final Motion to Impound should be due March 15. B. The CEOs' Motion To Impound At the last hearing, the Cour t granted a provisional impoundmen t of information regarding the compensation of t he three Defendants who have ser ved as Purdue's Chief Executive Officer. The Commonw ealth opposes the long-term impo undment of that information, because the public should be allowed to assess the key facts about these Defendants' compensation that are relevant to, among other thin gs, personal jurisdiction, civil penalties and damages under Ch apter 93A, and any potential sett lement of the Commonwealth's claims. The public is entitled t o know the specific facts of t hese Defendants' compensation, not merely that they were highly compensated. Purdue currently seeks redacti ons in the Amended Complaint in m ore than 100 paragraphs and footnotes concerni ng payments to individual Defe ndants on the basis that the information relates to compensation. The Commonwealth is challenging Purdue 's confidentiality designations regarding all those allegations in the MDL. It is possible that this Court may be called on to decide the question of impoundment of compensation-related information for others at Purdue, beyond the three CEOs. To provide for an orderly process, the Commonwealth suggests that the Court continue the provisional impoundment of the CEOs ' information until this Court decides Purdue 's fully-supported, specific motion to impound.

Gasdia Assistant Attorney General 7 Exhibit 1 Massachusetts Attorney General Office's Letter Brief to MDL Special Master Cathy Yanni THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ONE ASHBURTON PLACE BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS 02108 (617) 727- 2200 (617) 727- 4765 TTY www.mass.gov/ago 1 January 14, 2019 Via Electronic Mail Re: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation, MDL No. 2804 Massachusetts Challenges to Confidentiality Designations of Purdue Dear Special Master Yanni: I write on behalf of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office (the \"Massachusetts AGO\") requesting your resolution of a dispute arising from Purdue's position that certain allegations contained in the Massachusetts AGO's Amended Complaint should stay redacted in the public file in the Massachusetts Superior Court . This request follows from the MDL Court's December 20, 2018 Order, directing the parties to seek guidance from the Special Masters pursuant to the protocols set forth in the Court's Protective Order and Protocol for S tate and Federal Court Coordination for resolving confidentiality designation disputes . I. Background Purdue designated as Confidential and Highly Confidential millions of pages of documents it produced in the MDL. On December 20, 2018, the Massachusetts A GO notified Purdue it was challenging, pursuant to paragraph 52 of the MDL Protective Order, Purdue's confidentiality designations only as they relate to the text of the allegations in the Massachusetts Amended Complaint , and not any other material in the underlying Purdue documents. Counsel for the parties made sincere, good faith efforts to resolve the dispute . In emails to the Massachusetts AGO on January 3, 9, and 10, Purdue consented to unredact several hundred paragraphs of the Amended Complaint and to narrow the redactions in several other paragraphs. As of the date of this letter, Purdue seeks to maintai n redactions in 189 paragraphs and footnotes in the Amended Complaint. On January 10, the Massachusetts AGO notified Purdue that it would press its challenge to all the remaining redactions and indicated its intent to submit a position letter to you as Special Master. A summary of each designated item and the respective basis for Purdue's confidentiality claim is attached hereto as Exhibit A . A copy of the Amended Complaint with each of these 189 items highlighted is attached as Exhibit B . The highlight ing in Exhibit B matches the redaction in the Amended Complaint. 2 II. Purdue's Bases For Redactions Are Insufficient Case Management Order No. 2 provides that Purdue bears the burden of persuasion in this challenge to its confidentiality designations, as if it were seeking a Protective Order pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c). Rule 26(c) requires Purdue to demonstrate \"good cause\" for maintaining the redactions. It must do so by showing, \"with a particular and specific demonstration of fact, as distinguished from stereotyped and conclusory statements\" \"specific prejudice or harm [that] will result\" from each disclosure. See In re Ohio Execution Protocol Litigation , 845 F.3d 231, 236- 37 (6th Cir. 2016) . The bases for redactions that Purdue has offered are insufficient to meet its burden for a host of reasons. First, Purdue's categorical positions are exactly the type of conclusory statements that fall short of Rule 26(c)'s \"good cause\" requirement. \"To demonstrate good cause, the movant must a rticulate specific facts showing clearly defined and serious injury resulting from the discovery sought and cannot rely on mere conclusory statements.\" Stout v. Remetronix, Inc ., 298 F.R.D. 531, 35 (S.D. Ohio 2014) (internal quotations and citations omitted); see also Solar X Eyewear, LLC v. Bowyer, 2011 WL 3921615, at *3 (N.D. Ohio 2011) (\"Without specific, definitive showings of cognizable harm, [a court] has no basis to find good cause to issue a protective order.\"). Purdue has not met that burden. Second, the facts alleged in the Amended Complaint are not trade secrets or proprietary innovations. Instead, Purdue seeks to protect assertions its directors and officers made about opioids, sales tactics that were not secret, and evidence of it s executives' participation in sales and marketing.1 Third , the business information Purdue seeks to protect is stale. \"[B]usiness information that is substantially out of date is unlikely to merit protection under Rule 26(c).\" Clark v. Prudential Ins. C o. of America, 2011 WL 1833355 at * 3) (D.N.J., 2011). Much of the information Purdue seeks to redact is too old to merit court protection as proprietary business information. For example, Purdue seeks redactions in 27 paragraphs that concern informatio n from more than ten years ago.2 Fourth , even with regard to recent years, the business information that Purdue seeks to conceal is obsolete because it describes practices that Purdue promised to end. For example, Purdue seeks to redact scores of allegat ions about its massive opioid sales force, which Purdue shut down last year .3 If Purdue is considering re -starting its aggressive tactics of sending hundreds of sales reps to promote opioids to doctors across Massachusetts and the nation, it should say so in a n affidavit. Likewise, Purdue seeks to maintain as proprietary business information its tactics for circumventing prescription limits , getting patients on higher doses of opioids, and keeping patients on opioids longer \u2014 harmful conduct that is not a business strategy Purdue can enlist the Court to protect.4 1 E.g., Ex. D, \u00b6\u00b6 177, 204, 208, 215, 221, 222, 231. 2 E.g., Ex. D, \u00b6\u00b6 177, 188, 189, 204, 215, 221, 222, 226, 227, 231, 239, 240, 242, 247, 249, 250, 251, 498, 515, 517, 520, 597, 612, fn 125, fn 143, fn 173. 3 E.g., Ex. D, \u00b6\u00b6 208, 215, 222, 249, 250, 259, 314, 315, 347, 384, 404, 407, 410, 413, 532, 564, 568, 572, 597, 666, 681, 808. 3 Fifth , Purdue wrongly seeks protection for basic facts about the company's conduct under a sweeping claim to confidentiality for \"Board of Directors Decision -Making.\"5 Members of the Board of Directors are defendants in the Massachusetts suit. Rule 26(c) does not provide categorical protection to facts about corporate conduct wherever the board is involved. See Wall Industries, Inc. v. U.S., 5 Cl. Ct. 485, 485- 88 (1984) (denying protective order for documents, including board minutes, where movant's argument amounted to \"broad, vague and conclusory generalizations.\"). Corporate board materials are routinely disclosed publicly through litigation when, as here, they are relevant to the claims.6 Sixth , Purdue wrongly seeks to conceal information about scores of payments to its directors and officers under the categorical assertion that \"compensation\" is confidential.7 As with directors ' minutes, however, such inform ation is regularly disclosed as relevant evidence in court documents. See Baxter Intern., Inc. v. Abbott Labs, 297 F. 3d 544, 547 (7th Cir. 2002) (\"[M]any litigants would like to keep confidential the salary they make...but when [facts] are vital to claims made in litigation they must be revealed.\") . The information at issue here does not describe a business strategy or compensation system that could be used by anyone to Purdue's competitive disadvantage. Instead, the allegations describe individual s extracting vast sums from misconduct that should never happen again. Seventh , Purdue seeks to conceal information that should fairly be disclosed to contradict inaccurate sworn statements by Purdue's officers and directors in the Massachusetts litigat ion. With the exception of Russell Gasdia, every individual defendant in the Massachusetts action moved to dismiss the suit for lack of personal jurisdiction and made a sworn statement denying involvement in Purdue's marketing and sales. Richard Sackler, for example, attested that he did not \"direct any marketing, sales, or promotional activities by [Purdue] in Massachusetts.\" Rule 26(c) does not allow Purdue 's leaders to say one thing publicly under oath and then ask the assistance of a Court in withhol ding from the public the evidence that disproves those statements.8 5 E.g., Ex. D, \u00b6\u00b6 188, 189, 204, 208, 215, 221, 222, 227, 238, 240, 242, 247, 249, 250, 251, 253, 259, 265, 268- 271, 291, 292, 294, 295, 305, 307, 308, 309, 310, 314- 316, 322, 325, 326, 327, 334, 340, 345, 346, 347, 357, 363, 364, 389, 395, 412, 437, 458, 460, 483, 485, 494, 496, 498, 501- 508, 515, 517, 521, 526, 528, 532- 535, 539, 540, 554. 6 E.g. In Re Parmalat Securities Litigation , 258 F.R.D. 236, 252 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (vague and conclusory claims of economic and competitive harm insufficient to establish good cause for sealing corporate board minutes); Sims v. BB&T Corp. , 2018 WL 3466945 at *4 (M.D.N.C. 2018) (declining to seal rele vant board minutes based on conclusory statements of harm or citations to cases with distinguishable circumstances ); City of Greenville, IL v. Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. , 2013 WL 1164788, at *4 (S.D. Illinois, 2013)(declining to seal corporate board minutes that did not \" contain sufficient indicia of confidentiality [or] reveal confidential strategies that [were] commercially relevant ... such that disclosure would likely subject the defendants to a risk of harm.\"); Bovie Medical Corp. v. Livneh, 2010 WL 4117635, at *3 (M.D. Florida, 2010)(Defendants failed to show good cause to overcome common law right of access to board minutes filed in court); and Byrnes v. Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, 2000 WL 60221, at *5 (S.D.N.Y., 2000)(probative value of board mi nutes outweighed any potential chilling effect of disclosure on corporate decision -making). 7 E.g., Ex. D, \u00b6\u00b6 200, 238, 239, 242, 247, 259, 265, 303, 317, 320, 322, 324, 327, 336, 340, 357, 362, 363, 365. 8 E.g., Ex. D, \u00b6\u00b6 208, 215, 221, 222, 226, 231, 240, 250, 253, 268, 269, 270, 271, 307, 308, 309, 310, 314, 315, 325, 364, 369, 370, 384, 389, 395, 412, 458, 460, 485, 494, 502, 503, 508, 521, 526, 532, 533, 534, 535, 539, 540, 554, 566, 571, 572, 597, 612, 620, 627, 819, 828. 4 Eighth , Purdue wrongly seeks to conceal behind a protective order allegations of the Massachusetts AGO on the basis that they are not supported by the documents produced in the MDL, or are \"misleading\" or \"mischaracterizations.\"9 That assertion is not a basis for confidentiality. Purdue is free to deny the allegations that the Attorney General of Massachusetts has made; it cannot use Rule 26(c) to hide them. Ninth, the disclosure sought by the Massachusetts AGO is narrowly tail ored. The AGO has not sought blanket de -designations of the underlying documents. The AGO seeks to disclose only the text of allegations that it has made in its filed Amended Complaint. Finally, Purdue seeks to conceal information of great public intere st. The Attorney General is the Commonwealth's lawyer, and the people of Massachusetts should see the allegations brought in their name. Revealing the truth about Purdue's misconduct is important to achieve justice and make sure deception like Purdue's n ever happens again. As an Ohio court held when denying a similar request for a protective order: \"[T]his motion for a protective order has more to do with other litigation and bad publicity than with what the court finds to be but vague and conclusory al legations of competitively sensitive documents. The court 'must consider the need for public dissemination, in order to alert other consumers to potential dangers posed by the product.' If the sharing of discovery can possibly save lives and stop injurie s such as occurred here by forcing this defendant to act, then no protective order should prohibit it. As pointed out in plaintiff's brief in opposition: ' The analogous question to be asked here is whether the documents produced in the Ford Pinto Fuel tan k cases should have been kept from the public.' The answer there, as here, must be a resounding ' No.'\" Koval v. Gen. Motors Corp., 62 Ohio Misc. 2d 694, 699 (1990) (internal citation omitted). For the forgoing reasons, the Massachusetts AGO respectfully request that its challenge to the 189 confidentiality designations be granted. If Purdue provides more detailed and specific support for its positions, the Massachusetts AGO respectfully requests the opportunity to respond. Thank you for your attention in this matter.

Dangerous opioid drugs are killing people across Massachusetts. Prescription medicines, which are supposed to protect our health, are instead ruining people's lives. Every community in our Commonwealth suffers from the epidemic of addiction and death. 2. Purdue Pharma created the epidemic and profited from it through a web of illegal deceit. First, Purdue deceived Massachusetts doctors and patients to ge t more and more people on its dangerous drugs. Second, Purdue misled them to use higher and more dangerous doses. Third, Purdue deceived them to stay on its drugs for longer and more harmful periods of time. All the while, Purdue peddled falsehoods to keep patients away from safer alternatives. Even when Purdue knew people in Massachusetts were addicted and dying, Purdue treated doctors and their patients as targets to sell more drugs. At the top of Purdue, a small group of executives led the deception and pocketed millions of dollars. 3. On behalf of the Commonwealth, the Attorney General asks the Court to end Purdue's illegal conduct and make Purdue and its culpable executives pay for the harm they inflicted in our state. II. PARTIES 4. The plaintiff is Attorne y General Maura Healey, who brings this action in the public interest in the name of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 5. The defendants are two companies and seventeen individuals who engaged in a deadly, deceptive scheme to sell opioids in Massachusetts. This Amended Complaint addresses the bases for jurisdiction and liability as to each of the nineteen defendants, arising from their decade- long course of misconduct in Massachusetts that involved hundreds of deaths, hundreds of thousands of unlawful acts, and hundreds of millions of dollars. 3 6. Defendant Purdue Pharma Inc. is a drug company incorporated in New York with its principal place of business in Connecticut. It is the general partner of D efendant Purdue Pharma L.P. , a limited partnership established in Delaware with its principal place of business in Connecticut. This Complaint refers to Purdue Pharma Inc. and Purdue Pharma L.P. collectively as \"Purdue.\" 7. The seventeen individual defendants are current and former directors and officers of Purdue Pharma Inc. In Massachusetts, directors, officers, and employees of corporations are not immune from jurisdiction or liability when they break the law. Instead, every individual is accountable for his or her actions.1 8. Defendants Ri chard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler, Ilene Sackler Lefcourt, Jonathan Sackler, Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler, and Theresa Sackler controlled Purdue's misconduct. Each of them took a seat on the Board of Directors of Purdue Pharma Inc. Togethe r, they always held the controlling majority of the Board, which gave them full power over both Purdue Pharma Inc. and Purdue Pharma L.P. They directed deceptive sales and marketing practices deep within Purdue, sending hundreds of orders to executives and line employees. From the money that Purdue collected selling opioids, t hey paid the mselves and their family billions of dollars . 9. Defendants Peter Boer, Judith Lewent, Cecil Pickett, Paulo Costa, and Ralph Snyderman took seats on the Board and knowingly advance d the Sacklers' scheme. 1 E.g., Kleinerman v. Morse, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 819 (1989); Hongyu Luo v. Tao Ceramics , 32 L. 134 (Mass. 2d 255 (D. Mass. 2012); Trans National Travel v. Sun Pacific Intern ., 10 F. Supp. 2d 79 (D. Mass. 1998); Yankee Group v. Yamashita , 678 F. Supp. 20 (D. Mass. 1988); Johnson Creative Arts v. Wool Masters , 573 F. Supp. 1106 (D. Mass. 1983). \"The question of personal jurisdiction over an individual, therefore, rests on whether there is an independent basis for jurisdiction based on an individual's actions, regardless of the capacity in which those actions were taken.\" Rissman , 901 F. Supp. 2d at 263. A defendant's \"status as a corporate officer and director d oes not insulate him from personal jurisdiction.\" Id. at 264. 4 10. Defendants John Stewart , Mark Timney, and Craig Landau each directed Purdue's deception as CEO of Purdue Pharma Inc. and Purdue Pharma L.P. Defendant Russell Gasdia carried out the misconduct as Vice President of Sales and Marketing. 11. Beverly Sackler , Jonathan Sackler , Kathe Sackler, Paulo Costa, Mark Timney, and Craig Landau reside in Connecticut. David Sackler, Ilene Sackler Lefcourt , and Mortimer Sackler reside in New York. Richard S ackler, Peter Boer , and John Stewart reside in Florida. Judith Lewent and Cecil Pickett reside in New Jersey . Ralph Snyderman resides in North Carolina. Theresa Sackler resides in the United Kingdom. Russell Gasdia resides in Massachusetts. 12. The Court has jurisdiction over all the defendants for the reasons set forth on pages 51- 269 below. III. OUTLINE OF THE COMPLAINT 13. On May 15, 2007, this Court entered Judgment (\"2007 Judgment\") to prohibit Purdue's dece ptive conduct in the sale of opioids. This suit addresses Purdue's misconduct since that 2007 Judgment. 14. The Complaint begins with the story of Purdue's misconduct in Massachusetts (pages 1 -51). The C omplaint then explains how each individual defendant br oke the law (pages 52-256). Sections addressing jurisdiction, the counts, prayers for relief , and the jury demand then follow, as outlined in the following Table of Contents. 5 TABLE OF CONTENTS I.

PURDUE'S DRUGS KILL HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE I N MASSACHUSETTS 15. Opioids are killing people all around us. More than 11,000 people died from opioid- related overdoses in the past decade in Massachusetts \u2014 more than everyone killed in car accidents and murders combined. The people of Massachusetts also survived more tha n 100,000 overdoses that were not fatal, but still devastating. Th is crisis is not natural or normal. Drug companies , particularly Purdue, created th is tragedy by deceiving doctors and patients about their dangerous drugs. AGO graph from Massachusetts Department of Public Health data 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017622 638 560656742961135217682155 1977Opioid Deaths in Massachusetts 8 16. Opioids are dangerous narcotics that can be deadly , because they can cause patients to stop breathing and suffocate. 17. Opioids are also highly addictive. Patients using opioids for more than a few days can experience severe withdrawal symptoms if they stop taking the drugs, including: anxiety, insomnia, pain, blurry vision, rapid heartbeat, chills, panic attacks, nausea, vomiting, and tremors. Withdrawal can last so long and be so painful that it is difficult to stop taking opioids. 18. Putting patients on opioids puts them at risk. Patients who take opioids at higher doses and for longer periods face higher and higher risk of addiction and death. Compared to our general population, Massachusetts patients who were prescribed opioids for more than a year were 51 times more likely to die of an opioid- related overdose. 19. Purdue took advantage of addiction to make money. For decades, physicians had reserved opioids for treating severe short -term pain, or for patients near the end of life . But the tradition of limiting opioids to short- term treatment ended after Purdue introduced OxyContin and began marketing it and other opioids with deceptive claims. 20. OxyContin's sole active ingredient is oxycodone, a molecule nearly identical to heroin. Purdue later introduced another dangerous drug, Butrans, which releases opioids into the body from a skin patch. Then Purdue introduced Hysingla, which contains yet another opioid. Almost all of Purdue's business is selling opioids. 21. Since May 2007, Purdue has sold more than 70,000,000 doses of opioids in Massachusetts. Purdue collected revenue of more than $500,000,000 from Massachusetts sales. For Purdue, the Mass achusetts prescriptions were a gold mine. 9 22. For patients, it was a massacre. Hundreds of patients who took Purdue's opioids in Massachusetts became addicted and died. An investigation by the Massachusetts Attorney General found that, since 2009, 671 people who filled prescriptions for Purdue opioids in Massachusetts subsequently died of opioid -related overdose s. 23. The people we lost worked as firefighters, homemakers, carpenters, truck drivers, nurses, hairdressers, fishermen, waitresses, students, mechanics, cooks, electricians, ironworkers, social workers, accountants, artists, lab technicians, and bartenders. They lived and died in every part of our state. The olde st died at age 87 . The youngest started taking Purdue's opioids at 16 and died when he was 18 years old. 24. Purdue's deception also imposed lasting hardship on the people who lost their loved ones . Because of Purdue's dishonesty, too many children in Massachusetts lost their parents . Too many parents in Massachusetts buried their children. Too many grandparents in Massachusetts are raising their grandchildren. 25. Patients who survive addiction need lengthy, difficult, and expensive treatment. People who are addicted to opioids are often unable to work. The addiction of parents can force their children into foster care. B abies are born addicted to opioids , because they are exposed to the drugs in the womb. 26. Purdue's misconduct has imposed heavy costs on the people of Massachusetts and on the Commonwealth. Intensive care for a newborn who has been harmed by opioids can cost $200,000, even before the baby comes home from the hospital. The injuries from addiction and overdose are staggering. For example, the W hite House Council of Economic Advisers determined that a middle estimate of the cost of each death from opioid overdose is $9.6 million. By that methodology, the 671 deaths that the Attorney General has already identified in 10 Massachusetts total more than $6 billion. 27. To profit from its dangerous drugs, Purdue engaged in a deadly and illegal scheme to deceive doctors and patients. First, Purdue deceived Massachusetts doctors and patients to get more people on its dangerous drugs. Purdue targeted vulnerabl e people who could be introduced to its opioids, including elderly patients, veterans, and people who had never taken opioids before. Second, Purdue misled them to take higher and more dangerous doses. Third, Purdue deceived them to stay on its drugs for longer and more harmful periods of time. 28. All the while, Purdue peddled falsehoods to keep patients away from safer alternatives. Even when Purdue knew people in Massachusetts were addicted and dying, Purdue treated doctors and patients as \"targets\" to sell more drugs. 29. Each part of the scheme earned Purdue more money from Massachusetts opioid sales and caused more addiction and death here in our Commonwealth. And each defendant participated in and profited from the scheme in Massachusetts, as set forth below. 11 V. PURDUE TARGETED MASSACHUSETTS WITH ITS UNFAIR A ND DECEPTIVE SALES CAMP AIGN 30. Hundreds of Massachusetts patients died after taking Purdue's drugs because Purdue targeted Massachusetts with a massive deceptive sales campaign. 31. Purdue's most powerful tool of deception was sending sales representatives to promote opioids to Massachusetts doctors, nurses, and pharmacists face to face. During sales visits, Purdue reps made false and misleading claims directly to the professionals who care for Massachusetts patients. Purdue assigned reps to specific territories in Massachusetts and gave them lists of Massachusetts doctors to visit. Purdue targeted doctors, nurses, and pharmacists in every part of our Commonwealth. Th e map below shows Massachusetts communities where Purdue promoted opioids since 2007. Each dot represents a city or town where Purdue sales reps promoted opioids in Massachusetts. Purdue Targeted Massachusetts 12 32. Since the 2007 Judgment , Purdue sales reps visited Massachusetts prescribers and pharmacists more than 150,000 times . A list of the exact date, location, sales rep, and \"target\" of each sales visit is attached as Exhibit 1. 33. Each of these in -person sales visits cost Purdue money \u2014 on average more than $200 per visit. But Purdue made that money back many times over, because it convinced doctors to prescribe its addictive drugs. When Purdue identified a doctor as a profitable target, Purdue visited the doctor frequently: often weekly, sometimes almost every day. Purdue salespeople asked doctors to list specific patients they were s cheduled to see and pressed the doctors to commit to put the patients on Purdue opioids. By the time a patient walked into a clinic, the doctor , in Purdue's words, had already \"guaranteed\" that he would prescribe Purdue's drugs. Purdue rewarded high- prescribing doctors with coffee, ice cream, catered lunches, and cash . Purdue has given meals, money, or other gifts to more than 2,000 Massachusetts prescribers. 34. Purdue judged its sales reps by how many opioids they got doctors to prescribe . Sales reps who generated the most prescriptions won bonuses and prizes. Reps who failed to get enough Massachusetts patients on opioids were placed on probation, put on performance improvement plans, and fired. 35. Purdue used face- to-face sales visits to conceal its deception by trying to avoid witnesses or a paper trail. When one sales rep made the mistake of writing down in an email her sales pitch to a doctor, Purdue's Vice President of Sales Russell Gasdia ordered: \"Fire her now!\" Purdue's leaders di d not want a record of their behavior because they knew they were breaking the law . 36. Purdue reinforce d its sales visits with dozens of other deceptive tactics aimed at Massachusetts. Purdue wrote deceptive pamphlets and mailed them to doctors in Massachuse tts. 13 Purdue streamed videos to Massachusetts doctors on its OxyContin Physicians Television Network . Purdue hired the most prolific opioid prescribers in Massachusetts as spokesmen to promote its drugs to other doctors. Purdue funded the Massachusetts G eneral Hospital Purdue Pharma Pain Program and an entire degree program at Tufts University to influence Massachusetts doctors to use its drugs. 37. Purdue used all these deceptive tactics to collect money in Massachusetts, by getting more Massachusetts patients on opioids, at higher doses, for longer periods of time. 14 VI. PURDUE DECEIVED DOCTORS AND PATIENTS TO GET MORE PEOPLE ON DANGEROUS DRUGS, AT HIGHER DOSES, FOR LO NGER PERIODS A. Purdue Deceived Doctors and Patients t o Get More and More People on Its Dangerous Drugs (i) Deception About Addiction 38. Purdue always kne w that its opioids carry grave risks of addiction and death. Instead of being honest about these risks, Purdue obscured them, including by fa lsely stating and implying that \"appropriate\" patients won't get addicted. 39. In a pamphlet for doctors, Providing Relief, Prev enting Abuse: A Reference Guide To Controlled Substance Prescribing Practices, Purdue wrote that addiction \"is not caused by drugs.\" Instead, Purdue assured doctors that addiction happens when the wrong patients get drugs and abuse them: \" it is triggered in a susceptible individual by exposure to drugs, most commonly through abuse.\"2 40. Purdue promoted its opioids to Massachusetts patients with marketing that was designed to obscure the risk of addiction and even the fact that Purdue was behind the campaign. Purdue created a website, In The Face of Pain, that promoted pain treatment by urging patients to \"overcome\" their \"concerns about addiction.\" Testimonials on the website that were presented as personal stories were in fact by Purdue consultants, whom Pu rdue had paid tens of thousands of dollars to promote its drugs.3 2 Providing Relief, Preventing Abuse (2008) , pg. 12, PTN000003587. 3 2011- 10-24 website capture, In the Face of Pain, PVT0033890 -891. 15 41. Another Purdue publication, the Resource Guide for People with Pain , falsely assured patients and doctors that opioid medications are not addictive: \"Many people living with pain and even some healthcare providers believe that opioid medications are addictive. The truth is that when properly prescribed by a healthcare professional and taken as directed, these medications give relief - not a 'high.'\"4 Purdue falsely denied the risk of addicti on, falsely implied that addiction requires patients to get \"high,\" and falsely promised that patients would not become addicted if they took opioids as prescribed. 42. Purdue funded and distributed many more publications that were similarly misleading. Exit Wounds : A Survival Guide to Pain Management for Returning Veterans and Their Families misleadingly claimed: \"Long experience with opioids shows that people who are not predisposed to addiction are unlikely to become addicted to opioid pain medications .\"5 43. Opioid Prescribing: Clinical Tools and Risk Management Strategies told doctors that \"addiction is rare in patients who become physiologically dependent on opioids while using them for pain control .\"6 44. Responsible Opioid Prescribing told doctors that onl y \"a small minority of people seeking treatment may not be reliable or trustworthy\" and not suitable for addictive opioid drugs.7 45. Over and over, Purdue told Massachusetts doctors and pharmacists that they could give opioids to \"trusted\" patients without risk of addiction, even though that was false. To promote its drugs, Purdue pushed the myth that addiction is a character flaw, and \"trustworthy\" 4 Resource Guide for People with Pain (2009) , pg. 8, PVT003 7321 . 5 Exit Wounds (2009), pg. 107, PTN000023114. 6 Opioid Prescribing : Clinical Tools and Risk Management Strategies (2009) , pg. 12, PWG000242087 . 7 Responsible Opioid Prescribing ( 2007 ), pg. 11, #448.1. 16 people don't get addicted to drugs. 46. A Purdue sales rep reported meeting with a Massachusetts pharmacist who said local doctors were reluctant to prescribe O xyContin. The Purdue rep pushed the pharmacist to get \"older, trustworthy customers\" on opioids: \"Made a case to her for those older, trustworthy customers that she knows well and committed her to step in and call the doctors. Said she would.\" 47. Purdue managers praised Massachusetts sales reps for pitching doctors on the idea that prescribing to \"trust worthy\" patients was safe. A sales rep reported that one doctor: \"let me know that she will Rx OxyContin when the pts [patients] has chronic pain and are trustworthy.\" The rep added that he would \"Follow up with Dr and ask what pts does she consider 'trust worthy?'\" A Purdue district manager responded: \"Great follow up question on what patients does he consider trustworthy.\" 48. Purdue knew better. B laming victims for being \"untrustworthy\" was a nother way to lie about Purdue's addictive drugs. (ii) Deception to Get Vulnerable Patients on Opioids 49. Pushing opioids for \" trustworthy \" patients was only one of Purdue's methods for getting more people on drugs. To expand the market for opioids, Purdue also trained sales reps to target vulnerable populations and encourage doctors to put them on opioids, without disclosing the risks. In Massachusetts, Purdue deceptively promoted opioids for elderly patients, veterans, patients who had never taken opioids, and patients with osteoarthritis \u2014 putting thousands more patients at risk. Elderly Patients 50. Purdue knew that prescribing opioids to elderly patients increases their risk of death. Elderly patients are at greater risk of dangerous in teractions between drugs. They are also 17 at greater risk of respiratory depression \u2014 in which patients suffocate and die. But Purdue saw the opportunity to earn millions of dollars by getting elderly patients on opioids because the public would pay throug h Medicare. Purdue's internal documents show that it target ed \"Patients over the age of 65 as more Medicare Part D coverage is achieved.\"8 51. Purdue disregarded and obscured the risks to elderly patients in its deceptive sales campaign. Purdue reps asked doctors to identify elderly patients and then solicited commitments from the doctors to give them Purdue opioids. In Massachusetts, a Purdue supervisor coached sales reps to \"Keep the focus on the geriatric patients\" and follow Purdue's \"geriatric strategy. \" 52. Purdue trained its reps to show doctors charts emphasizing Medicare coverage for its opioids and use profiles of fake elderly patients, complete with staged photographs, to convince doctors to prescribe opioids . As a Massachusetts sales rep observed, a fake patient profile \"brings the heart into it\" and helps get the doctor to say: \"Yes, they need this medication .\" 53. Purdue even made the false claim that elderly patients were especially likely to benefit from opioids. A rep reported to Purdue that she told a Massachusetts doctor that putting elderly patients on opioids would improve safety and quality of life by addressing \"the need for sleep for elderly, increased risk for falls if they need to get up at night-- take a pill, get glass, move ac ross a dark room --and the potential impact that could have on healing and mobility.\" In fact, elderly patients taking opioids have increased risks of fall ing and breaking bones . Veterans 54. Purdue also targeted veterans with its deceptive claims that they sh ould take opioids. Like the elderly, many veterans' prescriptions are paid for by the public, providing 8 2015- 01-28 Pain Products Presentation, p g. 12, P VT0029495. 18 another source of revenue when Purdue got veterans on its drugs. Records of sales meetings in Massachusetts show that Purdue reps emphasized insurance coverage by the veterans' Tricare program more than 500 times. 55. To target veterans, Purdue funded a book, Exit Wounds , which was packaged as the story of a wounded veteran but was really part of Purdue's deceptive marketing campaign. The book repeated Pur due's lie that patients would not become addicted to opioids: \"The pain- relieving properties of opioids are unsurpassed; they are today considered the 'gold standard' of pain medications, and so are often the main medications used in the treatment of chronic pain. Yet, despite their great benefits, opioids are underused. For a number of reasons, healthcare providers may be afraid to prescribe them, and patients may be afraid to take them. At the core of this wariness is the fear of addiction, so I want t o tackle this issue head- on ... Long experience with opioids shows that people who are not predisposed to addiction are unlikely to become addicted to opioid pain medications.\"9 56. Purdue held special events to encourage doctors to prescribe opioids to veterans:10 Purdue flyer from 2011 57. Purdue's campaign to target veterans had a terrible cost. Compared to non- veterans, Massachusetts veterans are three times more likely to die from opioid overdose. Opioid -Naive Patients 58. Purdue also targeted patients who were not already taking opioids , described in 9 Exit Wounds (2009), pgs. 106- 107, PTN000023114. 10 2011 flyer , PTN000003864 . 19 the field as \"opioid- naive.\" Purdue unfairly and deceptively marketed its drugs as appropriate treatments for opioid -naive patients , without disclosing that they face even higher risks of overdose and death. 59. Purdue trained its sales reps to promote its drugs specifically for opioid- naive patients. In training calls, Purdue managers instructed: \"Your opportunity here is with the nai ve community, let's use the naive trial to m ake your case.\" \"You created an epiphany with the doctor today (potentially) by reviewing the opiate na ive patient profile. What made him more pat to write for this patient, being an amiable doctor, is the fact that he would not have to talk patients out of their short acting [opioids].\" \"This was an example of what a good call looks like ... [Dr.] was particularly interested in the RM case study of Marjorie, which generated a robust discussion of opioid nai ve patients ...\" 60. A sales script prompted sales reps to ask: \"Would you consider OxyContin for an opioid- naive patient?\" Another Purdue script read:11 Purdue sales script from 2011 61. Purdue also promoted its drugs for opioid- naive patients using the deceptive term \"first line opioid .\" \"First line\" is a medical term for the preferred first step in treat ing a patient . Opioids are not an appropriate first line therapy. Nevertheless, Purdue's internal documents and testimony from sales reps shows that Purdue repeatedly promoted OxyCont in as \"first line\" \u2014 \"the first thing they would take to treat pain.\" 11 OxyContin sales script, pg. 10, PWG000334238 . 20 62. Purdue also found vulnerable opioid -naive patients by targeting prescribers with the least training in the risks of opioids. Purdue determined that nurse practitioners, physician assist ants, and primary care doctors were especially responsive to sales reps, so it targeted them to sell more drugs . Osteoarthritis 63. Purdue also targeted new patients with the deceptive claim that its opioids should be used to treat the most common form of arthritis, osteoarthritis. Purdue decided osteoarthritis would be a money- maker because it is widespread. Purdue's documents emphasize that more than 20 million Americans have osteoarthritis, including most people over 75. 64. Opioids are not approved to treat osteoarthritis. Purdue conducted a single study on osteoarthritis for Butrans , and it failed. Purdue admitted in internal documents that its opioids \"are not indicated for a specific disease\" and \"it is very important that you never suggest to your HCP [health care professional] that OxyContin is indicated for the treatment of a specific disease state such as Rheumatoid Arthritis or Osteoarthritis.\" 65. Nevertheless, to meet its business goals, Purdue trained its Massachusetts sales reps to mislead doctors by promoting opioids for osteoarthritis without disclosing Purdue's failed trial. Purdue even measured how often it targeted osteoarthritis patients. A Purdue marketing presentation concluded that its sales reps were \"identifying appr opriate patients\" because osteoarthritis was specifically mentioned during 35% of sales visits. 66. Purdue also directed Massachusetts sales reps to use marketing materials that highlight patients with osteoarthritis, even though Purdue drugs were never indica ted for that disease and Purdue's Butrans trial had failed. 21 Purdue opioid promotion from 201512 12 2015 Butrans Patient Identification and Initiation Guide, p g. 16, PWG000080076 . 22 B. Purdue Deceived Doctors and Patients t o Use Higher and Higher Doses 67. For patients, taking higher doses of opioids increases the risk of addiction and death. B ut for Purdue, higher doses mean higher profits. So Purdue deceived doctors and patients to get people on higher and higher doses. 68. Purdue earns more money every time a patient moves to a higher dose. For example, Purdue's 2015 prices increase d dramatic ally as patients move to higher doses: OxyContin Prices bottle of 100 tablets (10 mg) $269.17 bottle of 100 tablets (15 mg) $396.28 bottle of 100 tablets (20 mg) $501.99 bottle of 100 tablets (30 mg) $698.15 bottle of 100 tablets (40 mg) $859.72 bottle of 100 tablets (60 mg) $1,217.22 bottle of 100 tablets (80 mg) $1,500.18 A patient taking the lowest dose pill twice a day for a week earns Purdue $38. But if the patient instead takes the highest dose, Purdue collects $210 \u2014 an increase of 450%. 69. To get that revenue, Purdue designed its sales tactics to increase doses. Purdue created a campaign for OxyContin around the slogan, Individualize The Dose , because Purdue determined that it would Increase The Dose. Purdue's CEO prepared a presentation to the Board of Directors explaining that Purdue would use Individualize The Dose to sell more of its highest doses. When Purdue decided to refresh the campaign with a new slogan, it hired consultants to study what would increase doses the most. 70. Purdue trained its sales reps that increasing a patient's dose (\"titration\") was a key move when making sales. Purdue's graphics show the one -way path of increasing doses that Purdue pushed doctors and patients to follow: 23 Purdue opioid promotion from 2008 Purdue opioid promotion from 201313 13 2008- 04 OxyContin Conversion/Titration Guide, pg. 14, PPLP003276594; 12 Butrans core visual aid, pg. 20, PWG 000076579. 24 71. Purdue tracked whether its sales reps were getting patients on higher doses and warned staff when doses were not increasing enough: \"Titration up to higher strengths, especially the 40mg and 80mg strengths, is declining.\" Purdue required its sales reps to \"practice verbalizing the titration message\" to get patients' doses up .14 72. Purdue knew its promotion drove patients to higher doses . Purdue's internal analysis \"found that there is greater loss in the 60mg and 80mg strengths (compared to other strengths) when we don't make primary sales calls.\"15 Purdue's business plans emphasized that \"OxyContin is promotionally sensitive, specifically with the higher doses, and recent research findings reinforce the value of sales calls.\" In 2014, when public health experts tried to save patients' lives by warning against high doses of opioids, Purdue pursued a \"strategic initiative\" to fight back and \"maintain 2013 dose mix.\"16 73. Purdue encouraged Massachusetts doctors to prescribe high doses and did not tell doctors, or even its own sales reps, that higher doses carry heightened risk of addiction, overdose , and death. A Massachusetts sales rep testified: Q: Are you aware of any risks in titrating to a higher dose with OxyContin? A. No. 74. Purdue's deception about the risk of higher doses was deliberate. Purdue claimed that \"dose was not a risk factor for opioid overdose,\" even while it admitted in internal documents that it was \"very likely\" that 2012- 10-01 internal Purdue analysis , pg. 22, PWG000226041. 25 75. Purdue analyzed, down to the last dollar , how much of its profit depended on patients taking higher doses of opioids . In the slide below, Purdue reminded staff that a shift to lower doses , which reduces the danger to patients, would be bad for Purdue' s bottom line.18 Purdue internal strategy presentation from 2012 76. When the U.S. Centers for Disease Control issued a national warning against the highest and most dangerous doses of opioids , Purdue studied prescription data to calculate how much profit it would lose if doctors followed the CDC's advice. Purdue determined that the amount at stake in Massachusetts was $23,964,122 \u2014 that was the extra revenue that Purdue was getting from the most dangerous doses of opioids, every year, in Massachusetts alone.19 18 April Board meeting Commercial Update, slide 74, PPLPC016000286167 . 26 Responding t o Addiction b y Increasing t he Dose 77. When patients showed signs of addiction to Purdue's opioids, Purdue urged doctors to respond by increasing the opioid dose. To convince doctors to increase the dose for addicted patients, Purdue peddled the false notion that patients suffered from \"pseudoaddiction.\" 78. A Purdue presentation for doctors titled Medication Therapy Management recited what had been the consensus view for decades: \"Many medical students are taught that if opioids are prescribed in high doses or for a prolonged time, the patient wil l become an addict.\" Purdue then assured doctors that this traditional concern about addiction was wrong \u2014 that patients instead suffer from \"pseudoaddiction\" because \"opioids are frequently prescribed in doses that are inadequate.\"20 79. A Purdue pamphlet tit led Clinical Issues in Opioid Prescribing urged doctors to look for pseudoaddiction: \"A term which has been used to describe patient behaviors that may occur when pain is undertreated. Patients with unrelieved pain may become focused on obtaining medicati ons, may ' clock watch,\" and may otherwise seem inappropriately \"drug- seeking. ' Even such behaviors as illicit drug use and deception can occur in the patient's efforts to obtain relief. Pseudoaddiction can be distinguished from true addiction in that the behaviors resolve when the pain is effectively treated.\" Purdue again urged doctors to prescribe higher doses, stating that opioids \"are frequently underdosed - or even withheld due to a widespread lack of information ... about their use among healthcare p rofessionals.\"21 80. In another pamphlet, Providing Relief, Preventing Abuse: A R eference G uide T o Controlled S ubstances P rescribing P ractices, Purdue admonished doctors that \"[u]ndertreatment 20 2007- 11 Medication Therapy Management : Opportunities For Improving Pain Care , slide 31, PTN000006105. 21 Clinical Issues in Opioid Prescribing (2008), pgs. 1 -3, PWG0000058054- 055. 27 of pain is a serious problem \" and \"pain should be treated aggressively.\" Purdue stated: \"Fact s About Addiction: 'Misunderstanding of addiction and mislabeling of patients as addicts result in unnecessary withholding of opioid medications.'\"22 81. Purdue released a second edition of Providing Relief, Preventing Abuse , which continued to urge higher doses, and added a new deception about the scientific \"literature\": \"The term pseudoaddiction has emerged in the literature to describe the inaccurate interpretation of [drug -seeking] behaviors in patients who have pain that has not been effectively treated.\"23 The revised pamphlet failed to disclose that none of the \"literature\" it cited included scientific or medical evidence supporting pseudoaddiction as a diagnosis separate from addiction. Nor did it disclose that all of the cited \"literature\" was linked to organizations and doctors paid by Purdue. 82. Purdue also urged doctors to prescribe higher doses in a Purdue -sponsored book, Responsible Opioid Prescribing, which again suggested that patients who appear to be addicted were instead \"receiving an inadequate dose\" and needed more drugs.24 83. Purdue knew its campaign to push higher doses of opioids was wrong. Doctors on Purdue's payroll admitted in writing that pseudoaddiction was used to describe \" behaviors that are clearly cha racterized as drug abuse\" and put Purdue at risk of \"ignoring\" addiction and \"sanctioning abuse.\" But Purdue nevertheless urged doctors to respond to signs of addiction by prescribing higher doses of Purdue's drugs. 22 Providing Relief, Preventing Abuse (2008) , pgs. 4, 6, PTN00003569 -570. 23 Providing Relief, Preventing Abuse (2nd ed. 2011), pg. 9, PTN00003555. 24 Responsi ble Opioid Prescribing (2011) , pg. 90, Bates no. #729.1 . 28 C. Purdue Deceived Doctors and Patients t o Stay on Its Drugs Longer and Longer 84. Just as Purdue made more money by pushing patients to higher doses, Purdue increased its profits by keeping patients on drugs for longer periods of time. Long- term opioid use causes addiction and death. But for Purdue, keeping patients on drugs longer me ant more profits. So Purdue deceived doctors and patients to stay on its drugs longer. 85. According to Purdue's 2015 price list, a patient taking Purdue's 80mg OxyContin pill twice a day for a week earned Purdue $210. If that same patient could be kept on t he drug for a year, Purdue collected far more money: $10,959.25 86. Purdue's profit came at a terrible human cost. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health studied more than a million real Massachusetts patients during the years of Purdue's misconduct and found that staying on prescription opioids longer dangerously increases the risk of overdose death. Compared to the general population, a patient who rece ives three months of prescribed opioids is 30 times more likely to overdose and die. A patient who stays on prescription opioids for 6- 11 months is 46 times more likely to die. And a patient who stays on prescription opioids for a year \u2014 like the example that earns Purdue $10,959 \u2014 is 51 times more likely to die.26 25 2015- 01-12 Price Increase Notification, of Opioid available at https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/08/31/data -brief -chapter -55-aug-2017.pdf. 29 AGO graph from Massachusetts Department of Public Health data 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 General Population 3 to 5 months of opioids6 to 11 months of opioids12 months of opioidsKeeping Patients On Opioids Longer Kills Them Opioid -related overdose deaths per 100,000 people in a study of 1.1 million Massachusetts patients prescribed opioids in 2011 deaths deaths deaths deaths deathsdeaths 30x46x51x 30 87. Even compared to the most famous deadly and addictive products , these are extraordinary effects. Smoking increases the chance o f lung cancer death by less than 51 times . 88. By getting patients addicted, Purdue greatly increased the patients' risk of harm from many drugs in the opioid class \u2014 including, heroin, fentanyl, and generic oxycodone \u2014 which share the same addictive chemistry as Purdue opioids. 89. To get patients to take that awful risk, Purdue deceived doctors into keeping patients on opioids for longer and longer periods of time. Purdue gave its salespeople explicit instructions to \"extend average treatment duration.\"27 Purdue's business plans valued patients by how long they could be kept on Purdue's opioids and targeted patients who could be kept on opioids for more than a year.28 To \"drive sales and profitability,\" Purdue deliberately worked to keep patients on its opioids longer.29 90. Purdue secretly determined that pushing patients to higher doses would keep them on opioids longer. Purdue developed tactics specifically to keep patients hooked on opioids longer, which it called by the euphemism: \" Improving the Length Of Therapy \" \u2014 sometimes abbreviated as \"LOT\" or \"LoT.\"30 Purdue taught its employees that there is \"a direct relationship\" between getting patients on higher doses and keeping them on Purdue's opioids longer.31 27 2011- 10-18 Welcome, slides 48 -49, PVT0007742 PWG000164238 -240 30 2013- 07 Sales & Marketing slide 35, PWG000163716 . 31 2012- 08-14 marketing plan, slide 25, PWG000062607 . 31 91. Purdue's internal marketing plan showed a graph that broke down exactly how getting patients on higher doses of opioids would get more patients to stay on drugs longer : Purdue internal strategy presentation from 2012 Purdue's sales rep s promoted higher doses , but they did not tell doctors and patien ts that the higher doses were a scheme to trap patients on Purdue's drugs. 92. To \"extend average treatment duration,\" Purdue deceptively claimed that patients ' becoming dependent on its drugs was not dangerous or deadly, but \"normal.\" Purdue taught doctors t hat: \"Healthcare professionals should recognize that tolerance and physical dependence are normal consequences of sustained use of opioid analgesics and are not the same as addiction.\"32 Purdue deceptively claimed that physical dependence on its opioids wa s \"a normal physiologic response ,\" \"an expected occurrence,\" and no more dangerous than \"many classes of 32 2009- 11 FACETS, slide 9, PTN000006436 . 32 medications\" that are not addictive, including drugs used to treat high blood pressure.33 Purdue set as one of its \"key messages\" that \"data support the use of opioids beyond 90 days and maintained through 52 weeks.\"34 93. One of Purdue's most powerful tactics to keep patients on opioids longer was an opioid savings card that gave patient s discounts on their first prescriptions. D iscounts could have cut Purdue's revenue if patients took opioids for a short time. But Purdue's internal 10 - year plan highlighted its discovery that opioid savings cards kept patients on opioids longer: \"more pa tients remain on OxyContin after 90 days.\"35 Purdue determined that opioid savings cards worked like the teaser rate on a long -term and very high- stakes mortgage. According to Purdue's internal analysis, the savings cards had the highest \" return on invest ment\" in the entire \"OxyContin Marketing Mix.\" The r eturn on investment for Purdue was 4.28, so that every $1,000,000 Purdue gave away in savings came back to Purdue as $4,280,000 in revenue because patients stayed on dangerous opioids longer.36 33 Is It Pain (2011) , slide 6, PTN000007194 . 34 2013- 07 Publication Plan for Lon g-Term Opioid Therapy for Chronic Non- Cancer Pain, pg. 3, . 35 Plan, slide 33, 11-01 Board report, p g. 31, PWG000414917 . 33 Purdue internal strategy presentation from 201137 94. Keeping more patients on opioids for longer than 90 days was one of Purdue's \"2011 Highlights.\"38 Purdue's directors and C EO \"emails targeted towards HCPs [healthcare professionals] practicing in Massachusetts\" to push opioid savings cards.39 But it was a public health disaster. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health found that patients who stayed on prescription opioids for more than 90 days were thirty times more likely to die of an overdose . 95. Purdue aimed to \"drive\" patients to higher doses and longer periods on drugs so forcefully that it could control how many kilograms of opioids were taken within 2%:40 37 2011- 12-06 slide 13, PWG003840379 38 10 -Year Plan, slide 33, PWG000164240. 39 2012- 11-01 Board report, p g. 17, PWG000413518 08-14 OxyContin marketing plan, slide 23, PWG000062605 . 34 Purdue internal strategy presentation from 2012 96. When Purdue's sales rep s talked with doctors about how to dose its drugs, and when Purdue sent opioid savings cards to patients, Purdue did not disclose that higher doses and savings were designed to keep patients on its drugs longer. Purdue did not disclose that its promotion to doctors was designed to drive the amount of drugs consumed by Massachusetts patients to within 2% of its desired profit. Purdue did not disclose that its business target would cause many more patients to get addicted and die. 97. Purdue's campaign to \"extend average treatment duration\" succeeded. A national study of tens of thousands of medical and pharmacy claims records published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine found that two- thirds of patients who took opioids for 90 days were still taking opioids five years later.41 VII. PURDUE PEDDLED FALSEHOODS TO KEEP PATIEN TS AWAY FROM SAFER ALTERNATIVES 98. Purdue not only lit the fire that killed so many patients; it also tried to block the exits that patients could have used to escape. Purdue peddled a series of falsehoods to push patients away from safer drugs and toward its opioids. 99. Purdue had no justification to steer patients away from safer alternatives, and it knew it. Purdue's internal documents admit that it \"cannot represent or suggest\" that its drugs are \"safer\" or \"more effective\" or make \"any other sort of comparative claim,\" because it had no drugs with the evidence required for such a claim. In its internal documents, Purdue admitted 41 Martin et al., Long- term chronic opioid therapy discontinuation rates from the TROUP study. J Gen Intern Med. 2011;26(12):1450- 7. Summarized in Purdue's files on pg. 15, PWG000226034. 35 that \"making comparative statements o f our product versus a competitor's product is never appropriate.\"42 Purdue internal presentation from 2011 But Purdue went ahead and made deceptive claims to steer patients away from alternatives. Deception a bout Tylenol and Ibuprofen 100. Purdue made decepti ve claims about research by its own employees, designed to \"highlight\" the risks of non- opioid drugs. Purdue deceptively compared the risks of high of acetaminophen and NSAIDs (non- steroidal th its claim that opioids have \"no ceiling dose,\" to falsely contend that opioids were safer , even though high doses of opioids pose grave risk of addiction and death. 42 2011- 10 Guidelines on Product Promotion: Comparative Claims Workshop, slide 12, PWG 000190160. 36 101. Purdue paid for deceptive propaganda by groups designed to appear independent from Purdue, promoting the message that NSAIDs and Tylenol have \"life -threatening\" side effects, but opioids are \"the gold standard of pain medications.\"43 102. Purdue funded \"switch research\" to \"understand what triggers prescribers to switch patients\" from safer NSAIDs to more dangerous opioids. Purdue hired consultants to study how to make doctors \"more comfortable\" about opioids and \"more cautious \" about non- drugs like ibuprofen.44 Deception a bout Lower -Dose Opioids 103. Just as Purdue deceptively steered patients away from ibuprofen and Tylenol, Purdue also deceived patients and doctors by claiming that Purdue's high- dose, extended- release opioids were superior to lower- dose, immediate- release opioids that had been used for decades before the epidemic. 104. In fact, Purdue's opioids (sometimes called ER/LA or extended release/long acting) are extraordinarily dangerous. The CDC found, based on published researc h, that there is \"a higher risk for overdose among patients initiating treatment with ER/LA opioids than among those initiating treatment with immediate -release opioids.\" The CDC \"did not find evidence that continuous, time -scheduled use of ER/LA opioids is more effective or safer than intermittent use of immediate -release opioids or that time -scheduled use of ER/LA opioids reduces risks for opioid misuse or addiction.\"45 105. Nonetheless, Purdue deceptively claimed that its opioids provided more effective pain relief than traditional immediate -release opioids (sometimes called IROs). Purdue sale reps 43 2009 Exit Wounds, p g. 104-106, PTN00002311 3-114. 44 2016- 02 NSAID to ERO Switch Research Final Report, slide s 3, 16, PWG000072 028, -041. 45 CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain (2016), available at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm . 37 admitted under oath that they told Massachusetts doctors that OxyContin provides more consistent pain relief with fewer peaks and troughs than IROs. Purdue records show that the sales reps repeatedly claimed that OxyContin's \"steady state is better than peak and trough w/ [IROs].\" Purdue claimed that OxyContin provides a \"full tank of gas,\" but immediate -release opioids require \"stopping at each exit to refuel.\" Purdue bolstered these misrepresentations with marketing materials that misrepresented data to indicate that Purdue drugs provided more consistent pain relief than more frequently dosed, lower -dose opioids. Deception a bout Quality of Life 106. Purdue also steer ed patients away from safer alternatives with the false claim that its opioids improve patients' \"quality of life.\" Purdue's internal documents admit that \"Purdue has no clinical studies or other substantial evidence demonstrating that a Purdue Product wi ll improve the quality of a person's life.\" Nevertheless, Purdue sales reps repeatedly claimed that its opioids improve quality of life. A Purdue sales rep noted the need to follow -up with a Massachusetts doctor to \"get commitment from him that he is def initely going to improve the quality of life for the [rheumatoid arthritis patient] he has.\" Purdue also devised and funded third -party publications to say that opioids give patients the \"quality of life we deserve.\"46 Deception a bout Risk o f Abuse 107. Purdue also steered patients away from safer alternatives with false claim s that its opioids had less risk of abuse. As more people died of addiction and overdose, Purdue created tamper -resistant versions of its drugs to be harder to crush. The FDA found that the changes had no effect on the most common way that the Purdue's pi lls were taken and abused : by swallowing them. \"The tamper -resistant properties will have no effect on abuse by the oral route (the most 46 Treatment Options: A Guide for People Living with Pain, p g. 15, PWG000243995 . 38 common mode of abuse).\"47 Despite that warning, Purdue deceptively marketed its opioids in a manner falsely implying t hey stop abuse \u2014 and even prevent addiction. 108. Purdue also paid for and promoted articles which stated or implied that its tamper- resistant drugs were safe. For example, in 2014, Purdue placed three articles in The Atlantic as sponsored content, including one titled Take My Pain Away ... A Physician's Perspective of Prescription Opioids and Pain Management by Dr. Gerald Aronoff. That article calls the tamper -resistant formulations \"safer alternatives\" and encourages physicians to \"embrace these additional choices, rather than decide to leave opioid prescribing.\"48 109. Purdue further created an unbranded marketing initiative, Opioids with Abuse Deterrent Properties, to encourage prescribers to switch to Purdue opioids. The initiative included a website, ads in medical journals, medical education events touting the benefits of the tamper -resistant drugs, and payments to doctors to promote Purdue opioids.49 110. Purdue's deceptive marketing convinc ed doctors of the falsehood that Purdue drugs are less addictive. In a national survey, conducted by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, almost half of doctors believed that tamper -resistant opioids were less addictive than other opioids, when in fact they are equally addictive. 50 111. In addition to visiting Massachusetts prescribers and pharmacists more than 150,000 times, Purdue distributed in Massachusetts thousands of copies of its deceptive publications, including Providing Relief, Preventin g Abuse ; the Resource Guide for People with Pain ; Exit Wounds ; Opioid Prescribing: Clinical Tools and Risk Management Strategies ; 47 2009- 12-30 New Drug Application 22 -272, OxyContin, Division Director Summary Review for Regulatory Action, pg. 7, availab le at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2010/022272s000MedR.pdf. 48 2014- 11-14 Take my Pain Away ...

Purdue's In The Face of Pain website was viewed in Massachusetts more than 11,700 times. VIII. PURDUE TARGETED DOCTORS WHO PRESCRIBED THE MOST DRUGS, EVEN WHEN THEY WROTE ILLEGITIMATE PRESCRIPTIONS AND THEIR PATIENTS DIED 112. Purdue pushed Massachusetts doctors to prescribe more and more opioids, because high -presc ribing doctor s earned Purdue millions of dollars. To make sure doctors prescribed more opioids , Purdue tracked Massachusetts doctors' prescriptions, visited their offices, bought them meals, and asked them to put specific patients on Purdue drugs. 113. Purdue selected doctors for target lists based on its estimates of wh ich doctors could be influenced to increase opioid prescriptions the most. Purdue managers told reps to visit most often the doctors who were most likely to change their prescribing to benefit Purdue . 114. In Massachusetts, sales reps visited Purdue's 100 top targets an average of more than 200 times each . Those visits cost Purdue more than $40,000 for each doctor. Purdue did not spend $40,000 per doctor so sales reps could w atch doctors write prescriptions that they were already going to write anyway . Instead, Purdue paid to lobby these doctors because Purdue knew its reps would convince them to put more patients on opioids, at higher doses, for longe r periods. T hose extra prescriptions pa id back Purdue's investment many times over. 115. Those extra prescriptions led Massachusetts patients to become addict ed, overdose, and die . Just as taking opioids increases risk s to a patient, meeting with Purdue sales reps increases the risk that a doctor will write dangerous prescriptions. Some of Purdue's top targets in Massachusetts lost their medical licenses because of their dangerous prescribing. Some went to prison. Most of Purdue's 100 top targets in Massachusetts prescribed Purdue opioids to patients who overdosed and died. 116. That disaster is not the normal effect of practicing medicine. It is not the 40 appropriate result of treating patients in pain . It is the consequence of Purdue breaking the law. Compared to Massachusetts doctors and nurses who prescribed Purdue opioids without lobbying from sales reps , Purdue's top targets wrote far more dangerous prescriptions. Purdue's top targets prescribed Purdue opioids to more of their patients, at higher doses, and for longer periods of time. Compared to Massachusetts doctors and nurses who prescribed Purdue opioids without seeing reps, Purdue's top targets were at least ten times more likely to prescribe Purdue opioids to patients who overdosed and died. North Andover, MA 117. From 2008 until he lost his medical license in 2012, Purdue's top prescriber in Massachusetts was Dr. Walter Jacobs in North Andover.51 He practiced alone. He often worked only three days a week. Nevertheless, in five years, he prescribed more than 347,000 pills of Purdue opioids. 118. Purdue knew Jacobs's practice inside and out. Purdue sales reps visited him more than a hundred times. Purdue pushed Jacobs to keep up a high rate of prescriptions - to keep writing \"new scripts\" - and to get patients on higher doses. Purdue's sales rep recorded his goal to \"get Dr Jacobs to write more of the intermediate strengths.\" The doctor complied. He prescribed tens of thousands of Purdue's intermediate strength pills. He also prescribed more than 200,000 of Purdue's highest strength 80mg OxyContin \u2014 the pill that is the most dangerous and the most profitable . 119. Based on its marketing research showing that opioid savings cards kept patients on opioids longer, Purdue urged Jacobs to distribute savings cards . Purdue asked him to have his patients t ravel to New Hampshire to fill prescriptions because opioid savings cards were illegal 51 Monthly prescription data by prescriber , PWG003984534 . 41 in Massachusetts until 2012.52 120. Purdue's sales rep reported to the company that Jacobs \"believes in Oxycontin\" and \"continues to switch patients from other medications to Oxycontin.\" A few weeks later, Purdue gave Jacobs a contract worth more than $50,000 to give speeches to other doctors to promote Purdue opioids. Purdue ended up paying him more than $80,000 \u2014 more than any other doctor in Massachusetts. 121. As Purdue's top paid consultant in Massachusetts, Jacobs exemplified Purdue's strategy of getting patients on higher doses and keeping them on opioids for longer periods of time. For one patient, he prescribed OxyContin for more than two years, at a rate of sixteen 80mg pills per day. For another patient, Jacobs prescribed OxyContin for more than two years \u2014 at a rate of twenty -four 80mg pills per day . When he lost his medical license, Jacobs admitted that he continuously prescribed narcotics to patients, ignored the ri sk of substance abuse, and kept prescribing narcotics even after his patients overdosed. 122. Purdue paid Jacobs to get more people on addictive opioids, at higher doses, for longer periods of time. By the time Jacobs lost his license, he had prescribed enough opioids for Purdue to collect more than $3 million.53 52 Jacobs' patients filled dozens of OxyContin prescriptions using savings cards at out -of-state pharmacies. Purdue reps asked other Massachusetts doctors to do the same thing, and their patients used savings cards that were banned in Massachusetts to buy more than 40,000 pills of OxyContin in neighboring states. PWG004285076. 53 The reven ue allegations in paragraphs 122, 124, 127, 133, 134, 139, 143, and 153 are estimated based on prices and prescription data. 42 Fitchburg and Waltham , MA 123. Another of Purdue's high- value targets practiced in Fitchburg and Waltham.54 Since 2008, Purdue sales reps visited him more than a hundred times. The Purdue reps encouraged the doctor to prescribe opioids to elderly patients, by emphasizing coverage on Medicare, and they asked him to find opioid- naive patients who could start taking opioids for the first time . The doctor gave Purdue what it wanted: when Purdue launched its Butrans opioid, the salesperson reported that the doctor was \"looking for an opioid naive patient to start Butrans on.\" A few weeks later, the sales representative reported to Purdue that \"Butrans is his new go to product.\" The next month, Purdue rewarded the doctor with a contract worth up to $48,000. 124. For years, Purdue paid the Fitchburg doctor tens of thousands of dollars to promote its opioids. And he delivered for Purdue. Since 2008, he prescribed more than 250,000 pills of Purdue opioids \u2014 enough to give Purdue more than $1.5 million. 54 This Complaint does not identify by name the doctors in paragraphs 12 3-127 because they are not defendants in this suit and are s till practicing medicine. The doctors named in paragraphs 11 7-122, 128 -153, and 3 10-313 no longer hold medical licenses in Massachusetts . 43 Fall River, MA 125. In Bristol County, Purdue targeted a doctor in Fall River. Since 2008, Purdue sales reps visited this doctor more than six hundred ti mes. In 2015, Purdue's rep was in his office almost every workday: Purdue Sales Rep Visits to One Massachusetts Doctor AGO graphic summarizing Purdue internal sales records 126. Purdue repeatedly asked the Fall River doctor to \"commit\" to prescribing its opioids, and he agreed over and over, day by day. For example, during the week of April 6 -10, 2015: Purdue's rep met the doctor at his office on Monday to discuss patients who w ould be coming in that day. On Tuesday, the salesperson met with the doctor again and confirmed that 44 the doctor had put the patients on Purdue opioids. On Wednesday, Purdue's salesperson came to the doctor's office again to discuss more patients. And ag ain on Thursday. And again on Friday. On the following Monday, the Purdue rep came back to talk with the doctor again. 127. The Fall River doctor told Purdue that he \"loves the idea\" of Purdue's Butrans opioid and more\" patients on Purdue's OxyContin. The next month, Purdue gave the doctor a consulting contract worth up to $48,000 to promote Purdue opioids. Purdue ended up paying him more than $50,000. In turn, the doctor prescribed more than 180,000 pills of Purdue opioids \u2014 enough for Purdue to collect more than $1.4 million. Hyannis, MA 128. On Cape Cod, Purdue targeted Dr. Conrad Benoit. From 2008 until May 2016, Purdue sales reps met with Benoit more than 90 times. 129. By 2012, Purdue knew or should have known that Benoit was engaged in problematic prescribing practices, keeping patients on opioids for extended periods without proper medical exams. Purdue's rep met with the doctor and recorded: \"he said that he does just refill meds out of ease of refilling given challenge with time in exam.\" At the next sales visit two weeks later, Purdue encouraged the doctor to prescribe more refills of its opioids. 130. Purdue's district manager went along on sales visits to coach the sales rep. In a written evaluation, the manager praised the rep for her control over the doctor: \"Very good close and taking control of the call ... [he] can get off topic, but you snapped fingers and said 'Dr. I need you focused.' He smiled and paid attention. Wow.\" The purpose of the in- person sales visits was to drive the doctors to prescribe. 131. In 2015, even after Purdue's sales rep reported \"a huge concern with the issue of narcotics in the cape,\" Purdue continued to target Benoit, calling on him 27 times through 2015 45 and into 2016 and making particular note of efforts to promote Hysingla and OxyContin. In February 2016, Purdue's sales rep logged a \"Report Of Concern\" when a newspaper reported on Benoit's excessive opioid prescribing and police found a patient with 420 pills. Purdue kept promoting opioids to the doctor anyway . 132. When the Board of Registration in Medicine suspended Benoit's medical license on May 5, 2016, Purdue was still urging him to prescribe its drugs. Purdue last attempted to promote opioids to Benoit on May 10, 2016, five days after his suspension. 133. Since 2008, Benoit had prescribed more than 34,000 pills of Purdue opioids \u2014 so Purdue collected more than $250,000. Brockton, MA 134. In Plymouth County, Purdue targeted Dr. Yoon Choi. Purdue promoted its opioids to Choi for a decade, from at least 2006 unti l July 2016, calling on him more than 200 times. In 2012 and 2014, Purdue salespeople reported concerns about Choi's prescribing behavior. Both times, Purdue advised the sales reps they could continue promoting opioids to him. In 2017, the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine suspended Choi's license after concluding he had committed negligence on multiple occasions, including in connection with two patients - a mother and son - who both overdosed on opioids and died. By the time the authorit ies stopped him, Choi had prescribed more than 108,000 pills of Purdue opioids \u2014 enough to give Purdue more than $750,000. Ludlow, MA 135. In Hampden County, Purdue targeted Dr. Fernando Jayma . Purdue promoted its opioids to Jayma from at least 2009 until in or around November 2013. Purdue's notes starting in 2010 are replete with red flags. In June 2010, Jayma told a Purdue sales rep that many of his 46 patients had failed drug screens and doct or shopped. In August 2011, Jayma told Purdue that he wrote six months' worth of prescriptions at a time and patients just c ame in and picked them up. In October 2011, Jayma told Purdue that an insurer was denying his OxyContin prescriptions. But, from Purdue's perspective, all was well. After a 2012 meeting with Jayma, the Purdue representative reported: \"he has written 5 new OxyContin scripts this week,\" and \"most are converting over to 40mg or higher.\" 136. In January 2013, a Purdue sales representative noted, to praise from her supervisor, that Jayma was taking opioid patients that other practices were turning away. In May 2013, Purdue's rep reported that Jayma was seeing a lot of patients from a doctor who had been arrested for improper prescribing and had his license seized. 137. Purdue kept promoting its opioids to Jayma until a new sales rep was assigned to his account and reported overwhelming signs of \"inappropriate prescribing\": \"Upon entering office it did not appear to be the typical internal med/ge neral medicine practice. All patients appeared to be there for pain management and no other health concerns ... While in the office the police had arrived because there had been 2 prescription pads stolen by a girlfriend of a patient. She tried to fill rx at local Stop and Shop and was turned down. [The medical assistant] further stated that they do see out of state patients and do not take drivers licenses and insurance card at time of check in. She stated that Rite A id pharmacy as a corporation will not fi ll any of dr.'s Rx's. Many other local pharmacies require additional information\" 138. On November 26, 2013, Purdue finally told its sales reps to stop promoting opioids to Jayma. Within six months, Jayma's prescriptions of Purdue opioids fell by 99%. In the summer of 2014, when Jayma was no longer valuable to Purdue, Purdue reported him to the DEA. 139. Jayma was convicted of illegally prescribing controlled s ubstances, and was sentenced to two -and-a-half years in the house of correction . But Purdue got what it w anted. 47 Since 2008, Jayma prescribed more than 68,000 pills of Purdue opioids \u2014 so Purdue took in more than $400,000. Stoneham, MA 140. Another of Purdue's high- value targets was Dr. Ellen Malsky in Stoneham. Purdue promoted its opioids to Malsky from at least 2006 until April 2011. Purdue's records show that red flags about her prescribing became apparent at least as early as March 2006, when Purdue's sales rep recorded a note that Malsky \"has issues with legal use of prescribing,\" and again, in May 2007, whe n Malsky raised concerns about attracting too much attention to her prescribing. 141. In December 2009, Purdue's sales rep noted that a patient of Malsky died from an overdose. Three months later, the Purdue representative recorded that Malsky \"lost her affili ation with BCBS - however, 75% of those patients switched to other plans in order to stay in her practice; BCBS said she was writing too many opioids as an Internal Medicine doctor[.]\" Meanwhile, Purdue kept asking Malsky to prescribe more of its drugs. 142. On September 29, 2010, Malsky told Purdue's sales rep she planned to close her practice \"because of pressure from the MA board to write less opioids.\" Purdue continued promoting its opioids to Malsky until the bitter end, when the sales rep showed up at he r practice to find it closed in April 2011. On April 22, 2011, Purdue finally told its sales reps to stop promoting opioids to Malsky because she had su rrendered her medical license. 143. Purdue already had its money in the bank. Since 2008, Malsky prescribed more than 114,000 pills of Purdue opioids \u2014 enough to give Purdue hundreds of thousands of dollars. 48 Holbrook, Weymouth, Winchester and Worcester, MA 144. As a final example, Purdue targeted Dr. Fathalla Mashali, who ran pain clinics in Holbrook, Weymouth, Winchester, Worcester, and Rhode Island. Purdue promoted its opioids to Mashali from at least May 2009 until June 2013, calling on him more than 150 times. 145. Purdue should have been aware of red flags from the beginning. At a promotional visit in May 2010, the Purdue rep learned that Mashali had inherited the patients from a doctor who lost his license for improper opioid prescribing. Purdue recorded: \"Dr. Mashali appears to be a very good new target.\" 146. Mashali went along with every part of Purdue's scheme. Purdue wanted patients to take its opioids instead of traditional lower -dose, shorter -acting \"SA\" drugs; Mashali told Purdue that he would \"focus on switching pts from SA meds to Butrans and OxyC ontin where appropriate.\" line when possible\" and would prescribe OxyContin \"more than any other branded medication.\" At his next sales visit, the Purdue rep asked Mashali to continue prescribing OxyContin first line. 147. Purdue's rep met with Mashali, \"introduced\" Butrans, and asked the doctor \"to start pts on Butrans today.\" Mashali immediately agreed that he opioid would be \"great\" for \"opioid na\u00efve patients.\" Five days later, at his next sales visit, Mashali told Purdue that he had already prescribed Butrans 10- 15 times and, in the next week, prescribed Butrans 30 more times. 148. During another sales meeting, Mashali told Purdue that he was seeing 70 patients the next day and \"guaranteed\" that he would put some on Purdue's opioids. Later, Purdue's rep reported: \"Dr. let me know he will continue to find more patients for\" Purdue opioids. Later, the rep wrote that Mashali was \"seeing 40 new patients each week\" and \"starting new patients on 49 Butrans every day.\" Purdue kept encouraging Mashali to prescribe its drugs. The manager overseeing all Purdue reps in the Boston area visited Mashali and got him to agree t o write to Massachusetts insurance companies to ask for more generous coverage of Purdue opioids. 149. Finally, in January 2012, a sales rep sent Purdue a \"Report Of Concern,\" because she heard that the DEA was investigating Mashali's office in Rhode Island. I n February, Purdue emailed its sales reps that, \"pending the outcome of any investigation of the Rhode Island office,\" they should not meet with Mashali in Rhode Island, but they could continue calling on him in Massachusetts. Purdue's records show that i ts sales reps continued to meet with Mashali at both his Rhode Island and Massachusetts offices. A few days later, the sales rep filed a second Report Of Concern, stating that insurance companies had cut off Mashali and he required patients to pay him $300 in cash. Purdue still did not instruct its reps to stop promoting opioids to him. 150. More than a year after that, in June 2013, Purdue's sales rep noted that she visited Mashali's office \"to follow up on the rumor I heard about him losing his license.\" The doctor's staff gave her \"a letter that is on the front door,\" announcing that Mashali was taking his patients off opioids. In an email, Purdue's sales manager worried about the bottom line: \"Dr. Mashali is the largest prescriber of OxyContin in the Dist rict and most likely the Region.\" He was cutting back on OxyContin \"because of so much scrutiny he's under.\" The sales reps were \"nervous of what it would do to their business.\" 50 151. The Massachusetts -based sales rep wrote: \"on several occasions recently wh en calling on his office patients are literally lined out the door. I have spoken with this staff and some of these patients are waiting up to 4- 5 hours before being seen by Dr Mashali . In addition, approximately 3 months ago he is no longer taking [Blue Cross Blue Shield] of MA. Dr Mashali claims it is because BCBS of MA, I could never get a straight answer. I suspect it could be for other reasons.... BCBS is not comfortable with the way he is practicing and trying to get reimbursement. Dr Mashali did s tate for many office visits he is now making patients pay cash for their office visits...Based on my observations and gut feeling including comments from other pain physicians in the area, lately there appears to be too many red flags with Dr Mashali.\" The Rhode Island- based sales rep replied: \"I agree.... My office has patients bringing their own 'beach type' folding chairs to sit on because at any given time, he can have 35 or more patients waiting only for him. All of his PA's have quit. He has patients scheduled at 9:30 am and he doesn't usually come 'sauntering' in until noon. He has changed his practice name yet again...3rd time in about 1 year. I even had one of his nurses tell me last visit that she has witnessed him deleting electronic records for certain patients...which makes her very uncomfortable. I've already reported him to Purdue several times.\" 152. About a month later, on July 31, 2013, Purdue finally told its reps to stop promoting opioids to Mashali. The Rhode Island Board of Medicine revoked his license, finding that he was \"an immediate threat to the health, welfare and safety of the public.\" 153. Seventeen patients who were prescribed Purdue opioids by Mashali died of opioid overdoses. Mashali was sentenced to eight years in prison for 27 count s of health care fraud. But Purdue profited . Since 2008, Mashali prescribed more than 367,000 pills of Purdue opioids \u2014 so Purdue collected nearly $2 millio n. 51 IX. PURDUE PHARMA INC. A ND PURDUE PHARMA L.P . ARE BOTH RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEADLY MISCONDUCT 154. Purdue Pharma Inc. and Purdue Pharma L.P. acted together to carry out all of the misconduct alleged in this Complaint. 155. According to it s official corporate documents, Purdue Pharma Inc.'s purpose is manufacturing, sales, distribution, and resea rch and development with respect to pharmaceutical, toiletry, chemical and cosmetic products, directly or as the general partner of a partnership engaged in those activities. That is the conduct at issue in this suit. 156. Purdue Pharma Inc. controlled Purdue Pharma L.P. as its general partner and is liable for the misconduct of the partnership as a matter of law. Purdue Pharma Inc. is also the general partner of Purdue Holdings L.P., which holds the sole limited partnership interest in Purdue Pharma L.P. 157. Purd ue Pharma L.P. employed the sales reps and paid the doct ors to promote Purdue's drugs. That is a key element of the conduct at issue in this suit . 158. Purdue Pharma Inc. and Purdue Pharma L.P. share d the same physical offices, the same CEO, and many of the same officers. 52 X. THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS LED PURDUE'S MISCONDUCT 159. This section of the Complaint identifies the individuals who are personally responsible for Purdue's illegal scheme. Massachusetts law agai nst unfair and deceptive conduct in commerce applies to individuals regardless of whether they are officers, directors, or employees. Holding individuals personally liable for their mis conduct does not require piercing a corporate veil. Individuals are personally liable if : (a) they p articipated in the misconduct; or (b) they knew about the misconduct and failed to stop it; or (c) they should have known about the misconduct and they failed to stop it. 55 In this case, the individual defendants made the decisions to break the law; they controlled the unfair and deceptive conduct; and they personally collected many millions of dollars from the deception. Summary Of The Individuals' Misconduct 160. The individual defendants were the chief architects and beneficiari es of Purdue's deception. In summary: 161. The individual defendants controlled the misconduct described in paragraphs 1- 158 above. 162. Each individual defendant knowingly and intentionally sent sales representatives to promote opioids to prescribers in Massachusetts thousands of times. 163. Each individual defendant knew and intended that the sales reps in Massachusetts would unfairly and deceptively promote opioid sales that are risky for patients, including by: 55 See Thermoplastic Elastomers, Inc. v. McKenna, No. 002018B, 2002 WL 968859, at *4 (Mass. Super. Feb. 5, 2002) (\"A c orporate officer may be held personally liable for his \"participation in unfair and deceptive practices.\"), citing Nader v. Citron, 372 Mass. 96, 103 (1977) ; Community Builders, Inc. v. Indian Moto rcycle Associates, Inc., 44 Mass. App. Ct. 537, 560 (1998). See also Townsends, Inc. v. Beaupre , 47 Mass. App. Ct. 747, 751 (1999) (\"A corporate officer is personally liable for a tort committed by the corporation that employs him, if he personally participated in the tort by, for example, directing, controlling, approving, or ratifying the act that injured the aggrieved party.\"; \"It is not necessary in all instances, however, to pierce the corporate veil in order to hold a corporate officer liable for a corporation's torts.\") . 53 falsely blaming the danger s of opioids on patients instead of the addictive drugs; pushing opioids for elderly patients, without disclosing the higher risks; pushing opioids for patients who had never taken them before, without disclosing the higher risks; pushing opioids as substi tutes for safer medications, with improper comparative claims; falsely assuring doctors and patients that reformulated OxyContin was safe; pushing doctors and patients to use higher doses of opioids, without disclosing the higher risks; pushing doctors and patients to use opioids for longer periods of time, without disclosing the higher risks; and pushing opioid prescriptions by doctors that Purdue knew were writing dangerous prescriptions. 164. Each individual defendant knew and intended that the sal es reps would not tell Massachusetts doctors and patients the truth about Purdue's opioids . Indeed, they knew and intended these unfair and deceptive tactics achieved their purpose by concealing the truth. 165. Each individual defendant knew and intended that prescribers, pharmacists, and patients in Massachusetts would rely on Purdue's deceptive sales campaign to prescribe, dispense, and take Purdue opioids. S ecuring that reliance was the purpose of the sales campaign. 166. Each individual defendant knew and intended that staff reporting to them would pay top prescribers tens of thousands of dollars to encourage other doctors to write dangerous prescriptions in Massachusetts. 167. Each individual defendant knew and intended that staff reporting to them would reinforce t hese misleading acts through thousands of additional acts in Massachusetts, including by sending deceptive publications to Massachusetts doctors and deceptively promoti ng Purdue opioids at Boston University, Massachusetts General Hospital, the Massachusett s College of 54 Pharmacy, Northeastern University, and the Sackler School at Tufts University. 168. Each individual defendant knowingly and intentionally took money from Purdue's deceptive business in Massachusetts. 169. Each individual defendant knowingly and intentionally sought to conceal his or her misconduct. A. Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler, Ilene Sackler Lefcourt, Jonathan Sackler, Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler, and Theresa Sackler 170. Eight people in a single family made the choices that caused much of the opioid epidemic. The Sackler family owns Purdue, and they always held a majority of the seats on its Board. Because they controlled their own privately held drug company, the Sacklers had the power to decide how addictive narcotics were sold . They hire d hundreds of workers to carry out their wishes, and they fire d those who didn' t sell enough drugs. T hey got more patients on opioids, at higher doses, for longer , than ever before . They paid themselves billion s of dollars . They are responsible for addiction, overdose, and death that damaged millions of lives. They should be held accountable now . The S ackler s' Misconduct Leading To The 2007 Judgment 171. The misconduct of Richard, Beverly, Ilene, Jonathan, Kathe, Mortimer, and Theresa Sackler was particularly unfair, deceptive, unreasonable, and unlawful because they already had been given a second chance. From the 1990s until 2007, they directed a decade of misconduct, which led to criminal convictions, a judgment of this Court, and commitments that Purdue would not deceive doctors and patients again. That background confirms that their misconduct since 2007 was knowing and intentional. 172. The Sackler family 's first drug company was the Purdue Frederick Company, which they bought in 1952. In 1990, they created Purdue Pharma Inc. and Purdue Pharma L.P. 55 Richard, Beverly, Ilene, Jonathan, Kathe, Mortimer, and Theresa Sackler took seats on the Board .56 For events before July 2012, this Complaint uses \"the Sacklers\" to refer to them . David Sackler joined the Board in July 2012.57 From that time forward , \"the Sacklers\" includes him as well. 173. The Sacklers always insisted that their family control Purdue. F rom 1990 until today, the ir family always held the majority of seats on the Board. In 1994, Jonathan Sackler issued a memorandum to Purdue staff requiring that the Sackler s should receive \"all Quarterly Reports and any other reports directed to the Board.\"58 174. Purdue launched OxyContin in 1996. It became one of the deadliest drugs of all time.59 The FDA scientist who evaluated OxyContin wrote in his original review: \"Care should be taken to limit competitive promotion.\"60 The Sacklers did not agree. From the beginning, the Sackler s viewed limits on opioids as an obstacle to greater profits. To make more money, the Sacklers considered whether they could sell OxyContin in some countries as an uncontrolled drug. Staff reported to Richard Sackler that selling OxyContin as \"non-narcotic,\" without the safeguards that protect patients from addictive drugs, would provide \"a vast increase of the market potential.\"61 The inventor of OxyContin, Robert Kaiko, wrote to Richard to oppose this dangerous idea. Kaiko wrote that he was \"very concerned\" about the danger of selling 56 Purdue Pharma Inc.'s 1991 filings with the Secretary of State of Connecticut state that it was incorporated in New York on October 2, 1990. Richard, Ilene, Jonathan, and Kathe Sackler are all listed as directors on the earliest (1991) report. Beverly, M ortimer, and Theresa all appear on the 1995 report. 57 David Sackler affidavit. 58 1994- 04-28 memo from Jonathan Sackler, PDD1701827936. 59 See, e.g. 2016- 03-15 telebriefing by CDC Director Tom Frieden (\"We know of no other medication that's routinely used f or a nonfatal condition that kills patients so frequently ... those who got the highest doses of opioids, more than 200 MMEs per day had a 1 in 32 chance of dying in just 21/2 years ... almost all the opioids on the market are just as addictive as heroin.) , available at https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/t0315 -prescribing - opioids -guidelines html . 60 1995- 10 Overall Conclusion to 1995 FDA review, Curtis Wright, #785793.1. 61 1997- 02-27 email from Walter without strict controls. Kaiko warned: \"I don't believe we have a sufficiently strong case to argue that OxyContin has minimal or no abuse liability.\" To the contrary, Kaiko w rote, \"oxycodone containing products are still among the most abused opioids in the U.S.\" Kaiko predicted: \"If OxyContin is uncontrolled, ... it is highly likely that it will eventually be abused.\"62 Richard responded: \"How substantially would it improve your sales?\"63 175. At the OxyContin launch party, Richard Sackler spoke as the Senior Vice President responsible for sales. He asked the audience to imagine a series of natural disaster s: an earthquake, a volcanic eruption, a hurricane , and a blizzard . He said: \"the launch of OxyContin Tablets will be followed by a blizz ard of prescriptions that will bury the competition. The prescription blizzard will be so deep, dense, and white ....\"64 Over the next twenty years, the Sacklers ma de Richard's boast come true. They created a manmade disaster. Their blizzard of dangerous p rescriptions buried children and parents and grandparents across Massachusetts, and the burials continue . 176. From the beginning, the Sackler s were behind Purdue's decision to deceive doctors and patients. In 1997, Richard Sackler , Kathe Sackler, and other Purdue executives determined \u2014 and recorded in secret internal correspondence \u2014 that doctors had the crucial misconception that OxyContin was weaker than morphine, which led them to prescribe OxyContin m uch more often, even as a substitute for T ylenol .65 In fact, OxyContin is more 62 1997- PKY180280951. (Staff is perceived as being 'weaker' opioid than morphine, it has resulted in OxyContin being used much earlier for non- cancer pain. Physicians are positioning this product where Percocet, hydrocodone, and Tylenol with Codeine have been traditionally used. Since the non -cancer pain market is much greater than the cancer pain market, it is important that we allow this product to be positioned where it currently is in the physician's mind.\" Richard Sackler replied: \"I think you have this issue well in hand. If there are developments, please let me know.\"); 1997- 05-28 email from Richard Sackler PDD1508224773; 1997 -04-23 email from Richard Sackler, PDD1701801141. 57 potent than morphine. Richard directed Purdue staff not to tell doctors the truth, because the truth could reduce OxyContin sales.66 177. From the start, the Sacklers were also the driving force behind Purdue's strategy to push opioids .\" In 1998, Richard Sackler .67 178. Most of all, the Sackler s cared about money. Millions of dollars were not enough. They wanted billions. They cared more about money than about patients, or their employees, or the truth. In 1999, when employee Michael Friedman reported to Richard S ackler that Purdue was making more than $20,000,000 per week, Richard replied immediately, at midnight, that the sales were \"not so great.\" \"After all, if we are to do 900M this year, we should be running at 75M/month. So it looks like this month could be 80 or 90M. Blah, humbug. Yawn. Where was I?\" 68 179. In 1999, Richard Sackler became the CEO of Purdue.69 Jonathan, Kathe, and Mortimer were Vice Presidents.70 The company hired hundreds of sales representatives and taught them false claims to use to sell drugs.71 Purdue managers tested the sales reps on the most important false statements during training at company headquarters. On the crucial issue of addiction, which would damage so many lives, Purdue trained its sales reps to deceive doctors that the risk of addiction was \"less than one percent.\" 72 Purdue mailed thousands of doctors 66 1997- 06-12 email from Richard Sackler, PDD8801141848; 1997- 05-28 email from Richard Sackler PDD1508224773; from Richard Sackler, PDD1701801141. 67 email from Richard Sackler, PDD1701546497. 68 1999- 06-17 email from Michael Friedman, #228728.1. 69 [intentionally left blank] 70 2000- 03-26, Peter Healy, Opening the Medicine Chest: Purdue Pharma prepares to raise its profile, #24865.1 . 71 2003- 12-23 GAO Report, pg. 19, PKY183266843 (increase from 771 reps in 1999 to 1,066 in 2001). 72 Barry Meier, Pain Killer (1 ed. 2003) at 99. 58 promotional videos with that same false claim: \"There's no question that our best, strongest pain medicines are the opioids. But these are the same drugs that have a r eputation for causing addiction and other terrible things. Now, in fact, the rate of addiction amongst pain patients who are treated by doctors is much less than one percent. They don't wear out, they go on working, they do not have serious medical side effects.\"73 A sales representative told a reporter: \"We were directed to lie. Why mince words about it? Greed took hold and overruled everything. They saw that potential for billions of dollars and just went after it.\"74 180. In 2000, the Sackler s were warned t hat a reporter was \"sniffing about the OxyContin abuse story.\"75 The Sackler family put the threat on the agenda for the next Board meeting and began covering their tracks. The y planned a response that \"deflects attention away from the company owners.\"76 181. In January 2001, Richard Sackler received a plea for help from a Purdue sales representative. The sales rep described a community meeting at a local high school, organized by mothers whose children overdosed on OxyContin and died. \"Statements were made that OxyContin sales were at the expense of dead children and the only difference between heroin and OxyContin is that you can get OxyContin from a doctor.\"77 182. The next month, a federal prosecutor reported 59 deaths from OxyContin in a single state.78 The Sackler s knew that the reports underestimated the destruction.

It could have been far worse.\"79 The next week, on February 14, a mother wrote a letter to Purdue:80 \"My son was only 28 years old when he died from Oxycontin on New Year's Day. We all miss him very much, his wife especially on Valentines' Day. Why would a company make a product that strong (80 and 160 mg) when they know they will kill young people? My son had a bad back and c ould have taken Motrin but his Dr . started him on Vicodin, then Oxycontin then Oxycontin SR. Now he is dead! \" A Purdue staff member noted: \"I see a liability issue here. Any suggestions?\"81 183. That same month, Richard Sackler wrote down his solution to the overwhelming evidence of overdose and death: blame and stigmatize people who become addicted to opioids. Sackler wrote in a confidential email: \"we have to hammer on the abusers in every way possible. They are the culprits and the problem. They are reckless criminals. \"82 Richard followed that strategy for the rest of his career: collect millions from selling addictive drugs , and blam e the terrible consequences on the people who became addicted . By their misconduct, the Sackler s have hammered Massachusetts families in every way possible. And the stigma they used as a weapon made the crisis worse. 184. Not long after the mother's February 14 letter, the Sackler s achieved a long- sought goal: the front page of the New York Times reported that \"OxyContin's sales have hit $1 billion, more than even Viagra's.\" The same article noted that \"OxyContin has been a factor in the deaths of at least 120 people, and medical examiners are still counting.\"83 185. When Time magazine published an article about OxyC ontin deaths in New England, Purdue employees told Richard Sackler they were concerned. Richard responded with 79 2001- 02-08 email from Richard Sackler, PDD8801151727. 80 to Robin James Richard Sackler, PDD 83 2001- 03-05 article in New York Times, PDD9316101737. 60 a message to his staff . He wrote that Time 's coverage of people who lost their lives to OxyContin was not \"balanced,\" and the deaths were the f ault of \" the drug addicts,\" instead of Purdue. \"We intend to stay the course and speak out for people in pain - who far outnumber the drug addicts abusing our product.\"84 186. That spring, Purdue executives met with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\"). A senior DEA official sat across from Richard Sackler. Before the meeting ended, she leaned over the table and told Richard: \"People are dying. Do you understand that?\" 85 187. As Purdue kept pushing opioids and people kept dying, the company was engulfed in a wave of investigations by state attorneys general, the DEA, and the U.S. Department of Justice. In 2003, Richard Sackler left his position as President of Purdue. After a few more years of investigation, Jonathan, Kathe, and Mortimer Sackler resigned from their positions as Vice Presidents. 86 But those moves were for show. The Sacklers kept control of the company. Their family owned Purdue. They controlled the Board. They paid themselves the profits. And, as alleged in detail below, they continued to direct Purdue's deceptive marketing campaign. 188. By 2006, prosecutors found damning evidence that Purdue intentionally deceived doctors and patients about its opioids. The Sackler s .

In May 2007, the Sacklers . The Purdue Frederick Company confessed to a felony and effectively went out of business.88 The Sackler s continued their opioid business in two other companies: Purdue Pharma Inc. and Purdue Pharma L .P. 190. The Sackler s voted to admit in an Agreed Statement Of Facts that, for more than six years, supervisors and employees intentionally deceived doctors about OxyContin: \"Beginning on or about December 12, 1995, and continuing until on or about June 30, 2000, certain Purdue supervisors and employees, with the intent to defraud or mislead, marketed and promoted OxyContin as less addictive, less subject to abuse and diversion, and less likely to cause tolerance and withdrawal than other pain medications.\" 89 191. To remove any doubt, the Sacklers voted to enter into a plea agreement that stated: \"Purdue is pleading guilty as described above because Purdue is in fact guilty .\"90 Those intentional violations of the law happened while Richard Sackler was CEO; Jonathan, Kathe, and Mortimer were Vice President s; and Richard, Jonathan, Kathe, Mortimer, Ilene, Beverly, and Theresa Sackler were all on the Board. 192. The Sackler s also voted for Purdue to enter a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the U.S. government. The agreement required the Sacklers to ensure that Purdue did not deceive 87 2006- 10-25 Board 89 2007- 05-09 Agreed Statement Facts, paragraph at https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/279028 -purdue -guilty -plea. 90 2007- 05-09 Plea Agreement. 62 doctors and patients again. The Sacklers promised to comply with rules that prohibit deception about Purdue opioids. They were required to complete hours of training to ensure that t hey understood the rules. They were required to report any deception. Richard, Beverly, Ilene, Jonathan, Kathe, Mortimer, and Theresa Sackler each certified in writing to the government that he or she had read and understood the rules and would obey the m.91 193. Finally, the Sackler s voted to enter into a Consent Judgment in this Court (\"2007 Judgment\") . The 2007 Judgment ordered that Purdue \"shall not make any written or oral claim that is false, misleading, or deceptive\" in the promotion or marketing of OxyContin. The judgment further required that Purdue provide fair balance regarding risks and benefits in all promotion of OxyContin. That j udgment required fair balance about the risks of taking higher doses for longer periods and the risks of addiction, overdose, and death.92 194. The 2007 Judgment further required that Purdue establish and follow an abuse and diversion detection program to identify high -prescribing doctors who show signs of inappropriate prescribing, stop promoting drugs to them, and report them to the authorities : \"Upon identification of potential abuse or diversion,\" Purdue must conduct an inquiry and take appropriate action, \"which may include ceasing to promote Purdue products to the particular Health Care Professional, providing f urther education to the Health Care Professional about appropriate use of opioids, or providing notice of such potential abuse or diversion to appropriate medical, regulatory or law enforcement authorities.\"93 195. The 2007 Judgment and related agreements should have ended the Sacklers' misconduct for good. Instead, the Sacklers decided to break the law again and again, expanding 91 2007- 05-09 Plea Agreement ; 2007 -05-04 Associate General Counsel's Certificate, PDD1712900054 . 92 2007- 05-15 Consent Judgment, Commonwealth v.

Ct. 63 their deceptive sales campaign to make more money from more patients on more dangerous doses of opioids . The Sacklers' Misconduct From The 2007 Judgment Until Today 196. From the 2007 Judgment to 2018, the Sackler controlled Purdue's deceptive sales campaign. They directed the company to hire hundreds more sales reps to visit doctors thousands more times. They insisted that sales reps repeatedly visit the most prolific prescribers. They directed reps to encourage doctors to prescribe more of the highest doses of opioids. They studied unlawful tactics to keep patients on opioids longer and then ordered staff to use them. They asked for detailed reports about doctors suspected of misconduct, how much money Purdue made from them , and how few of them Purdue had reported to the authorities . They sometimes demanded more detail than anyone else in the entire company, so staff had to create special reports just for them. Richard Sackler even went into the field to promote opioids to doctors and supervise reps face to face. 197. The Sacklers' micromanagement w as so intrusive that staff begged for relief . The VP of Sales and Marketing wrote to the CEO: \"Anything you can do to reduce the direct contact of Richard into the organization is appreciated.\"94 198. The Sacklers' directions shot through the company with dangerous force. When the Sackler s berated sales managers, the managers turned a round and f ired straight at reps in the field. When Richard Sackler wrote to managers, \"This is bad,\"95 to criticize the sales of Purdue's Butrans opioid, the managers in turn drafted a warning for employees : 94 2012- 02-07 email from Russell Gasdia, PPLPC012000368569. 95 from Richard Sackler, PPLPC012000368430 . 64 \"Just today, Dr. Richard sent another email, ' This is bad,' referring to current Butrans trends. I am quite sure that Dr. Richard would not be sympathetic to the plight of the Boston District.\"96 The manager then threatened to fire every sales rep in the Boston district: \"I am much closer to dismissing the entire district than agreeing that they deserve a pass for poor market conditions.\"97 199. The Sackler s took special interest in promoting Purdue's opioids in Massachusetts. The Sacklers decided to spend millions of dollars to establish the Massachusetts General Hospital Purdue Pharma Pain Program . Similarly, the Sackler s and Purdue pursued an intense relationship with Tufts University, which named its School of Biomedical Sciences as the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, and created an entire degree program, the Master of Science in Pain Research, Education, and Policy, funded by Purdue. The Tufts program is also home of an annual Sackler Lecture, which Purdue sales managers arranged for Purdue sales reps to attend. 98 The Sacklers also tracked Purdue initiatives to promote opioids at Boston University, Northeastern University, and the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy . 200. The Sackler s cared most of all about money. From 2007 to 2018, . . . . 201. As detailed below, the S acklers' misconduct continued from the 2007 convictions through 2018. 96 2012- 02-07 email from Windell Fisher, Fisher, PPLPC012000137174; PPLPC012000137178 . 65 2007 202. In July 2007, s taff told the Sackler s that more than 5,000 cases of adverse events had been reported to Purdue in just the first three months of 2007. Staff also told the Sacklers that Purdue received 572 Reports of Concern about abuse and diversion of Purdue opioids during Q2 2007 \u2014 includin g several reports in Massachusetts. Staff reported to the Sackler s that they completed only 21 field inquiries in response. Staff also told the Sackler s that they received more than 100 calls to Purdue's compliance hotline during the quarter, which was a \" significant increase,\" but Purdue did not report any of the hotline calls or Reports of Concern to the FDA, DEA, Department of Justice, or state authorities. 99 203. Purdue's self-interested failure to report abuse and diversion would continue, quarter after quarter, even though the 2007 Judgment required Purdue to report \"potential abuse or diversion to appropriate medical, regulatory or law enforcement authorities .\" Instead of reporting dangerous prescribers, or even directing sales reps to stop visiting them, the Sacklers chose to keep pushing opioids to whoever prescribed the most. 100 204. Staff also reported to the Sackler s that they continued to mail out thousands of deceptive marketing materials , including 12,528 publications in the first half of 2007. The single most -distributed material was volume #1 of Purdue's \" Focused and Customized Education Topic Selections in Pain Management \" (FACETS).101 In FACETS, Purdue falsely instructed doctors and patients that physical dependence on opioids is not dangerous and instead improves patients' \"quality of life\" \u2014 . In the same material, Purdue also falsely told doctors and patients that signs of addiction are actually 99 2007- 07-15 Board report, pg s. 33, 41, 54, PWG000300817, -825, -838. 100 For example, the Massachusetts prescribers described in paragraphs 1 12-153. 101 2007- 07-15 Board report, pg. 34, PWG000300818. 66 \"pseudoaddic tion,\" and that doctors should respond by prescribing more opioids.102 Staff told the Sackler s that another of the publications they had sent most often to doctors was \"Complexities in Caring for People in Pain.\"103 In it, Purdue repeated again its false cla im that warning signs of addiction are really \"pseudoaddiction\" that should be treated with more opioids.104 205. Purdue sent both of those misleading publications to doctors in Massachusetts.105 206. At the same time, staff also reported to the Sackler s that Purdue was making more money than expected. A few months earlier, they had projected a profit of $407,000,000; now they expected more than $600,000,000.106 207. Staff reported to the Sackler s that \"sales effort\" was a key reason that profits were high.107 Staff told the Sacklers that Purdue employed 301 sales reps to promote opioids and that sales reps were the largest group of Purdue employees by far . In comparison, Purdue employed only 34 people in drug discovery.108 102 2007- 08 FACETS Vol. 1, pg s. 51-53, PTN000004691 -693. 103 2007- 07-15 Board report, pg. 34, PWG0003008 18. 104 2007 Complexities of Caring for People in Pain, pg. 2, PTN00001680 6. 105 2010- 08-26 Medical 2007- 07-15 report, pg . 46, PWG0003008 108 2007- 07-15 Board report, pg . 52, PWG0003008 36. 67 208.

The impact of Purdue's sales reps in Massachusetts was direct and profound. F rom the 2007 felony conviction until 2018, Purdue sales reps visited Massachusetts prescribers and pharmacists more than 150,000 times.111 210. In August , Mr. Udell was still serving as Purdue's top lawyer , even after his criminal conviction. He wrote to Richard, Ilene, Jonathan, Kathe, Mortimer, and Theresa Sackler: \"Over the last week there have been numerous news stories across the nation reporting on the Associated Press 's analysis of DEA data showing very large increases in the use of opioids analgesics (particularly OxyContin) between the years 1997 and 2005. Many of these articles have suggested that this increase is a negative development suggesting overpromotion and increasing abuse and diversion of these products.\" 112 211. In October, staff told the Sackler s that Purdue received 284 Reports of Concern about abuse and diversion of Purdue's opioids in Q3 2007, and they conducted only 46 field inquiries in response. Staff reported to the Sackler s that they received 39 tips to Purdue's compliance hotline during the quarter, but Purdue did not report any of them to the authorities. 113 212.

Purdue sales reps visited him to promote opioids 19 times, until the police arrived with a warrant and his license was suspended for improper prescribing of pain medications. Eight of his patients died.114 213. Staff told the Sackler s that Purdue had hired more sales reps and now employed 304. They also reported to the Sackler s that Purdue was succeeding at promoting its highe st doses of opioids: \"OxyContin 80mg is at Rx levels not seen in over 2 years.\"115 214. In preparation for an upcoming Board meeting, Richard Sackler instructed staff to give him the spreadsheets underlying their sales analysis, so that he could do his own calculations. 116 The spreadsheets showed that, in 2007, Purdue expected to collect more than half its total revenue from sales of 80mg OxyContin \u2014 its most powerful, most profitable, and most dangerous pill. 117 215.

In January 2008, s taff told the Sackler s that Purdue still employed 304 sales reps and they were succeeding at the goal of promoting higher doses of opioids: \"OxyContin 80mg continues to grow.\" Staff told the Sackler s that, in 2007, Purdue's net sales were just over $1 billion, almost \"DOUBLE\" what the company had planned. OxyContin was more than 90% of those sales.119 217. Staff also told the Sackler s that Purdue received 689 Reports of Concern about abuse and diversion of Purdue's opioids in Q4 2007, and they conducted only 21 field inquiries in response. Staff also reported to the Sackler s that they received 83 tips to Purdue's compliance hotline during the quarter, but Purdue did not report any of them to the authorities.120 218. Staff also told the Sackler s that they promoted Purdue opioids a t the Massachusetts General Hospital Purdue Pharma Pain Program in Boston on November 1 and at a Tufts University c ourse on opioid laws and policies in Boston on October 31.121 219. The Sacklers wanted more details on tactics for pushing sales. Richard Sackler wrote to Russell Gasdia, V ice President of Sales and Marketing (hereinafter \"Sales VP\") , demanding information about Purdue's opioid savings cards. Richard asked Gasdia how long the opioid savings cards lasted, how much savings they offered a patient, and whether there had been any changes since he had last been bri efed on the opioid savings card scheme . Richard sent Gasdia a detailed hypothetical scenario to make sure he understood the sales tactic down to the 119 2008- 01-15 Board report, pg s. 4, 22, 24, PDD8901733977, -995, -997. 120 2008- 01-15 Board PDD89017339 89, -997. 121 2008- 01-15 Board report, pg. 16, PDD8901733989. 71 smallest details.122 Staff followed up with a presentation about opioid savings cards to the Sacklers at th e next Board meeting.123 220. Meanwhile, w hen staff proposed a plan to get pharmacies to increase their inventory of OxyContin from 2 bottles to 3 bottles, Richard Sackler demanded to know why they couldn't get up to 4 bottles or more.124 221. The Sacklers didn 't only sweat the small stuff. . At Purdue, hiring more sales reps was not a matter for middle management. Selling opioids door- to-door, in visits to doctor's offices and hospitals, was the core business of the company. The Sacklers themselves made the decisions . 122 2008- 01-30 email s from Richard Sackler, PPLPC012000168321 123 2008- 02-09 email from John Stewart, PPLPC012000170262 (opioid savings cards \" were singled -out for presentation since they are an extraordinary item in the budget and there is good data showing a positive impact on OxyContin utilizat ion\"). 124 2008- 02-19 email from Richard Sackler, PPLPC004000150467. 72 222. In February , the Sackler s .\"125 223. The Sackler s knew and intended that, because of their orders , more sales reps would promote opioids to prescribers in Massachusetts. In preparation for the Sacklers' vote, staff told them that adding 100 sales reps would allow Purdue to make 12,000 more sales visits to prescribers every month .126 125 2008- 02-08 Board 2007- 10-26 Sales & Marketing presentation, PPLPC012000159022 . 73 224. From 2008 to the present, sales reps hired in the 2008 expansion promoted Purdue opioids to Massachusetts prescribers more than 13,000 times , including Dighton, Orange, Orleans, Sagamore Beach, Seekonk, Sturbridge, Sutton, Taunton,Teaticket, Uxbridge, Vineyard Haven, Wareham, Webster, Boylston, Westport, Whitinsville, Whitman, Winchendon, Worcester, and Yarmouth Port . Massachusetts Communities Targeted in Purdue's 2008 Sales Force Expansion 74 225. Purdue managers determined that two sales reps hired in the 2008 expansion generated so many additional opioid prescriptions in Massachusetts that they were among Purdue's top performers. The company rewarded them with bonuses and all -expense- paid trips to tropical islands and used them as examples to motivate other reps to sell more opioids.127 226. The Sacklers also knew and intended that the sales reps would push higher doses of Purdue's opioids. That same month, Richard Sackler .\"128 . The Sacklers knew higher doses put patients at higher risk. As far back as the 1990s, Jonathan and Kathe Sackler .\"129 227. On Valentine's Day, the Sackler s .130 . 228. By 2008, Purdue was working on a crush-proof reformulation of OxyContin to extend Purdue's patent monopoly.131 The Sa ckler s learned that another company was planning clinical research to test whether crush -proof opioids are safer for patients.132 Mortimer Sackler suggested that Purdue conduct similar studies to find out whether reformulated OxyContin was really safer before selling it to millions of patients. He wrote to Richard Sackler: \"Purdue should be leading the charge on this type of research and should be generating the research to support 127 2018- 02-18 deposition of Catherine Yates Sypek pg. 120; 2018- 03-01 deposition of Timothy Quinn pg. 99. 128 2008- 02-13 email from Richard Sackler, PPLPC012000170 948-949. 129 memo from John 02-14 Board minutes, PKY183212622. 131 2007- 10-26 & Marketing presentation, pg. 2, PPLPC012000159022. 132 2008- 02-07 email from Robert Kaiko, PPLPC013000244844. 75 our formulation. Why are we playing catch up ...? Shouldn't we have studies like this ...?\"133 The Sacklers decided not to do the research because th ey wanted the profits from a new product, regardless of whether the deaths continued. Richard didn' t want a paper trail, so he instructed Mortimer to call him, and CEO John Stewart met with his staff to plan how to phrase a carefully worded reply.134 Later that month, Stewart wrote to Richard that reformulating OxyContin \"will not stop patients from the simple act of taking too many pills.\"135 229. Meanwhile, staff gave J onathan, Kathe, Mortimer and Richard Sackler projections indicating that OxyContin sales c ould plateau .136 Mortimer demanded answers to a series of questions about why sales would not grow .137 Richard chimed in at 8:30 p.m. to instruct the staff to find answ ers \"before tomorrow.\"138 Staff emailed among themselves about how the Sacklers' demands were unrealistic and harmful and then decided it was safer to discuss the problem by phone.139 133 2008- 02-12 email from Mortimer Sackler, PPLPC013000244843- 844. 134 2008- 02-12 email from Richard Sackler, PPLPC013000244843 (\"My sentiments exactly the first time I read it.

Five years later, Purdue published two studies about the crush -proof formulation. Neither concluded the crush- proof tablets lowered the risks of addiction, overdose and death associated with OxyContin use. One was a single -session research study conducted by three full-time Purdue employees and a paid Purdue consultant to assess \"the attractiveness\" of the crush- proof tablets to recreational drug users. Thirty recreational opioid users were interviewed by two researchers. \"This study did not include safety, pharmacokinetic, or efficacy evaluations, and no drugs were administered.\" Participants' answers to \"open -ended questions\" indicated that the crush -proof tablets \"might be less attractive to recreational opioid abusers\" than original OxyContin. The study concluded that \"among the available opioid products that we included in this study, recreation al opioid users judged [crush- proof OxyContin tablets] to be the least attractive, the least valuable and the least desirable, with the least likelihood for tampering and the lowest street value.\" PTN000002031 -2034. In the second study, by the same Purdue authors, 29 volunteers snorted OxyContin (original and crush -proof), oxycodone, and a placebo over a seven -day treatment phase and rated the drugs. The study concluded that \"reformulated OxyContin has a reduced abuse potential compared to the original f ormulation upon intranasal administration.\" PTN000002031, -2044.

He directed sales and marketing staff to turn over thousands of pieces of data about sales trends, including data to distinguish the kilograms of active drug from the number of prescriptions, so he could analyze higher doses.140 Staff delivered the d ata early Sunday morning; Richard responded with detailed instructions for new data that he wanted that same day.141 An employee sent Richard the additional data only a few hours later and pleaded with Richard : \"I have done as much as I can .\" The employee explained that he needed to attend to family visiting from out of town.142 Richard responded by calling him at home , insisting that the sales forecast was too low , and threatening that he would have the Board reject it.143 On Monday, staff emailed among themselves to prepare for meeting with Richard , highlighting that Richard was looking for results that could only be achieved by hiring more sales reps. Meanwhile, Richard met with John Stewart to discuss his analysis of the weekend's data and new graphs Richard had made.144 231. Sales VP Russell Gasdia was struggling to handle the pressure.

Instead, he push ed staff to sell more of the highest doses of opioids and get more pills in each prescription. That same Satu rday night, Richard sent Gasdia yet another set of instructions, directing him to identify tactics for \"exceeding 2007 Rx numbers on an adjusted basis (adjusted for strength and average number of tablets per Rx). \"146 The very next day, Gasdia was writing up plans for how adding sal es reps, opioid savings cards, and promoting more intermediate doses of OxyContin could help increase sales. 147 233. Richard Sackler followed through on his weekend threat that he would have the Board reject the sales plan. Two days later, Richard circulated his own sales analysis to the Board , ordered the Secretary to \"put this high in the Board agenda,\" and proposed that he and Mortimer Sackler oversee a redo of the annual plan as well as the 5 -year plan for Purdue's opioids. 148 234. At the same time, Jonathan, Kathe, and Mortimer Sackler were also pushing staff about sales . Staff told those three Sacklers that they would use opioid savings cards to meet the challenge of keeping OxyContin scripts at the same level in 2008 as in 2007, \"in spite of all the pressures.\" 149 Kathe demanded that staff identify the \"pressures\" and provide \"quantification of their negative impact on projected sales.\"150 145 2008- email from Russell Gasdia, from Russell Gasdia, from Edward Mahony, 150 2008- 03-11 email from Kathe Sackler, PPLPC012000175155. 78 235. In April , staff told the Sackler s that Purdue employed 304 sales reps. Staff reported to the Sacklers that the reps had obtained data showing which pharmacies stocked higher strengths of OxyContin, which helped them convince area doctors to prescribe the highest doses . Staff also told the Sackler s that Purdue received 853 Reports of Concern about abuse and diversion of Purdue opioids in Q1 2008, and they had conducted only 17 field inquiries in response. Staff also reported to the Sackler s that they received 83 tips to Purdue's compliance hotline during the quarter , but did not report any of them to the authorities.151 236. Staff also told the Sackler s that they promoted Purdue's opioids at Tufts Health Care Institute's program on Opioid Risk Management in Boston on March 27.152 237. On April 18, Richard Sackler sent Kathe, Ilene, David, Jonathan, and Mortimer Sackler a secret memo abou t how to keep money flowing to their family. Richard wrote that Purdue's business posed a \"dangerous concentration of risk.\" After the criminal investigations that almost reached the Sackler s, Richard wrote that it was crucial to install a CEO who would be loyal to the family: \"People who will shift their loyalties rapidly under stress and temptation can become a liability from the owners' viewpoint.\" Richard recommended John Stewart for CEO because of his loyal ty. Richard also proposed that the family should either sell Purdue in 2008 or, if they could not find a buyer, milk the profits out of the business and \"distribute more free cash flow\" to themselves.153 151 2008- 03-15 Board report, pg s. 17, 23, 27, PDD8901724 450, -456, -457, -460. 152 16, PDD8901724449. 153 2008- 04-18 email and attached memo from Richard Sackler, PDD9316300629 -631. 79 238.

On April 18, the Sackler s .158 Then, Richard Sackler sent Sales VP Russell Gasdia a series of questions about Purdue's efforts to get patients to take higher doses and stay on opioids for longer times. Richard wanted to know: how many Purdue patients had insurance that would let them take unlimited quantities of Purdue opioids; how many patients were limited to 60 tablets per month; and how many patients had any limit on the number of tablets or dose or number of tablets per day. He demanded that sales staff be assigned to answer his questions \"by tomorrow morning.\" 159 When the sales staff pleaded for a few more hours to collect the data, Richard agreed to give them until the end of the day.160 241. In May , staff sent the Sackler s more ideas about ways to promote Purdue's opioids. The proposal matched the Sackler s' own plan, which Richard had written out as CEO: deflect blame from Purdue's addictive drugs by stigmatizing people who become addicted. \"KEY MESSAGES THAT WORK\" included this dangerous lie: \"It's not addiction, it's abuse. 155 2016- 04-13 Q1 2016 Commercial Update, slide 74, PPLPC016000286167 . 156 Purdue Drug Units Dispensed by HCP, Product, and Strength, PWG003984518 -45. 157 2.8% of $112,000,000. from Richard Sackler, PPLPC012000179497. 160 2008- 04-22 email from Richard Sackler, PPLPC012000179679. 81 It's about personal responsibility.\"161 242.

After five prescriptions, many patients would f ace significant withdrawal symptoms if they tried to stop taking opioids. Staff told Richard, Jonathan, Kathe, and Mortimer Sackler that 27% of patients (more than 18,000 people) had used the card s for all five prescriptions.165 245. In July , Purdue's Fleet Depa rtment reported to the Sackler s that Purdue had bought one hundred new Pontiac Vibes for the expanded s ales force. Staff also told the Sackler s that Purdue received 890 Reports of Concern regarding abuse and diversion of Purdue's opioids in Q2 2008 and had conducted only 25 field inquiries in response.

In September, the Sackler s .168 248. In October, staff told the Sackler s that surveillance data monitored by Purdue indicated a \"wide geographic dispersion\" of abuse and diversion of OxyContin \"throughout the United States.\" Staff told the Sacklers that \"availability of the product\" and \"prescribing practices\" were key factors driving abuse and diversion of OxyContin.\" On the same day , staff told the Sackler s that Purdue had begun a new \"Toppers Club sales contest\" for sales reps to win bonuses, based on how much a rep increased OxyContin use in her territory and how much the rep increased the broader prescribing of opioids \u2014 the same \"availabili ty of product\" and \"prescribing practices\" factors that worsen the risk of diversion and abuse. In the same report, staff told the Sackler s that they received 163 tips to Purdue's compliance hotline during Q3 2008, but did not report any of them to the au thorities. 169 249.

During Q3 2008, the number of sales visit s to Massachusetts prescribers increased by 20% to more than 1,800.171 250. In November, the Sacklers . Purdue's 2009 budget identified expanding the sales force as the #1 sales and marketing objective.172 The Sacklers .173 Staff told the Sackler s that their decision would pay an average sales rep salary of $89,708 and bonus of $43,470, and the sales reps would visit prescribers 518,359 times.174 251.

In April , staff told the Sackler s that Purdue employed 412 sales reps and had made dramatic progress promoting higher doses: \"for the first time since January 2008, OxyContin 80mg strength tablets exceeded the 40mg strength.\"179 The Sacklers had a detailed conversation with Sales VP Russell Gasdia about the staffing of the sales force, how many sales reps the company should employ, and how many prescribers each rep would visit each year. 180 The Sacklers told sales executives to hire a new staff member who would contact prescribers electronically and would promote Purdue opioids through the deceptive website Partners Against Pain. 181 255. Staff told the Sackler s that they received 122 tips to Purdue's compliance hotline during Q1 2009, and revealed one of them to an outside monitor. Staff reported to the Sackler s that the compliance problems included improper use of OxyContin marketing materials and opioid savings cards.182 256. In May , staff told the Sac klers .183 Because sales reps lobbying doctors poses a high risk of misconduct (no witnesses, and the rep is paid to increase opioid sa les), the United States required that Purdue managers supervise sales reps in person at least 5 days each year.184 Purdue management disregarded that obligation 178 2009- 03-05 Board minutes, PKY183212703 -711. 179 2009- -337. 183 2009- 05-08 corporate compliance quarterly report to the Board 1Q09, slide 6, PPLPC029000274906 . 184 Purdue Corporate Integrity Agreement section III.K. 85 .185 Even though Purdue .186 257. Staff also told the Sacklers that they were awaiting new regulations for drug marketing in Massachusetts.187 258. In June , Richard Sackler asked sales staff how a competing drug company had increased sales: \"What is happening???\"188 Staff replied that it was all about sales reps: \"They have 500 reps actively promoting to top decile MDs ... Their messaging is 'we are not OxyContin,' alluding to not having the 'baggage' that comes with OxyContin. Interestingly, their share is highest with MDs we have not called on due to our downsizing and up until last year, having half as many reps. Where we are competing head to head, we decrease their share by about 50%.\" 189 259. A few days later, s taff reported to the Sackler s that Purdue had expanded its sales force at the Board's direction: \" As approved in the 2009 Budget, 50 New Sales Territories have been created. \" Staff told the Sackler s the expansion was focused on the most prolific opioid prescribers, because \" there are a significant number of the top prescribers \" that Purdue had not been able to visit with its smaller force of sales reps.190 Later that month, the Sackler s .191 185 2009- 05-08 corporate compliance quarterly report to the Board 1Q09, slide 6, PPLPC029000274906 (\"Compliance was not monitoring against the 'five full days' requirement \"). 186 2009- 07-30 Board report, pg. 16, PPLPC012000233246 . 187 2009- 05-08 corporate compliance quarterly report to the Board 1Q09, slide 14, PPLPC019000275103. 188 2009- 06-12 email from Richard PPLPC021000235124. from Russell Gasdia, Pamela notes, PPLPC012000226606. 191 2009- 06-26 Board minutes, PKY183212742. 86 260. In July , staff told the Sacklers that Purdue employed 429 sales reps.192 Richard Sackler told staff that he was not satisfied with OxyContin sales and demanded a plan to \"boost\" them. He asked for the topic to be added to the agenda for the Board.193 261. In August , Richard Sackler convened a meeting of Board members and staff about \" all the efforts Sales and Marketing is doing and planning to do to reverse the decline in OxyContin tablets market .\" He emphasized that $200,000,000 in profit was at stake.194 At the meeting, staff told the Sacklers that the 80mg OxyContin pill was far -and-away Purdue's best performing drug. Purdue sold many more kilograms of active ingredient in the 80mg dose than any other dose (about 1,000 kilograms : literally a ton of oxycodone).195 262. Staff also reported to the Sacklers about their newest OxyContin sales campaign, with the slogan: Options .196 The Options campaign set the pattern that Purdue would follow for years: pushing doctors and patients up the ladder to higher doses. To make it easy for sales reps to promote higher doses, the campaign materials emphasized the \"range of tablet strengths,\" provided a picture of each dose, and said: \"You can adjust your patient's dose every 1 to 2 days.\" Staff told the Sacklers that they would advertise the Options campaign in medical journals reaching 245,000 doctors.197 192 2009- 07-30 Board report, pg. 19 email from Richard Sackler, 194 2009-08-12 from Richard Sackler, PPLPC012000234970 -971; also 2009- 08-10 email from John Stewart, PPLPC012000234801 (\"Richard has asked me about this at least 5 times over the past few weeks\"). 195 2009- 08-19 Board slides, slide 08-19 Board slides, slides 12, 16, PPLPC012000235543 ; Options marketing materials, PMA000189015. 87 Purdue's 2009 m arketing c ampaign 'Options' 263. Staff also reported to the Sacklers that more than 160,000 patients had used Purdue's opioid savings cards , more than doubling the result reported to the Sacklers the summer before.198 Staff also told the Sacklers that they would advertise OxyContin using a special television network: thousands of doctors would be given free digital video recorders for their home televisions, in exchange for watching advertisements for drugs.199 198 2009- 08-19 Board slides, slide 12, PPLPC012000235543.

Immediately after meeting with sales staff, Richard Sackler asked for the raw data underlying their presentation. When staff had not responded within five minutes, he asked again.200 265. In September, the Sacklers .201 But Mortimer Sackler was concerned that staff were not selling Purdue's opioids aggressively enough. He demanded to know why staff predicted a decline in OxyContin sales when he believed the market should grow. 202 266. In October, staff told the Sacklers that Purdue had expanded its sales force by 50 territories and now employed 475 sales reps.203 Richard Sackler directed staff to send him weekly reports on OxyContin sales.204 No one in the company received reports that often, so staff were not sure how to reply.205 Staff considered telling Richard that there were no weekly reports, but they decided to make a new report just for him instead.206 The CEO also instructed the Sales Department to report to the Sacklers with more explanation about its activi ties.207 267. That same month, the Sacklers and staff discussed federal sunshine legislation that would create a public database to disclose drug companies' payments to doctors.

Staff warned the two Sacklers that, although OxyContin sales were at record-breaking levels (nearly $3 billion per year), the decade-long rise in the total kilograms of oxycodone prescribed in America was beginning to flatten. 215 Higher doses contain more of that active ingredient and are more profitable to Purdue.

In 2009, the Sacklers decided to renew Purdue's commitment to spend $3,000,000 in Massachusetts to fund the Massachusetts General Hospital Purdue Pharma Pain Program .216 274. The Sacklers had chosen to launch the Massachusetts General Hospital Purdue Pharma Pain Program in 2002 after due diligence, including review of OxyContin sales data, led staff to conclude that it would help Purdue sell more opioids in Massachusetts.217 Staff commented positively on \"MGH's commitment to OxyContin,\" citing OxyContin's 63.1% market share in MGH's zip code and the fact that \"MGH also has a hospital owned pharmacy 213 2009- 11-02 budget presentation, PPLPC PPLPC023000228146; Health Policy Memorandum from David Haddox, PPLPC023000228147 at 48. 217 2001- 11-14 email from James Lang, PPLPC012000041068; 2001- 11-16 email from Phil Cramer, PPLPC014000021900. 91 which conservatively generates $25,000 per month in OxyContin sales.\"218 Staff also noted: \"MD accessibility is great ... they come to us with any questions, and allow us to see them when we need to.\"219 \"Partner's Healthcare Group is MGH's arm all around Boston - MGH has significant impact on these members (mostly primary care).

The agreement establishing the program gave Purdue the right to influence education of doctors in Massachusetts by proposing \"areas where education in the field of pa in is needed\" and \"curriculum which might meet such needs.\" Purdue was also entitled to appoint a voting member of the Educational Program Committee and a n advisor to the program's Oversight Board.221 276. When the Massachusetts General Hospital Purdue Pharma Pain Program launched, Purdue made sure that Boston area sales reps and the Sacklers were poised to lever the partnership to Purdue's advantage.222 Purdue staff planned a symposium and reception at the hospital's famous \"Ether Dome\" for which Purdue selected the speakers.223 Purdue staff also prepared a guest list, including \"key politicians ,\" who could influence policy in Massachusetts, and \"managed care administrators,\" who could decide whether Massachusetts insurance plans encouraged the use of Purdue's opio ids.224 277.

In 1980, three Sackler brothers, through a very large payme nt, established the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences. Later, in 1999, the Sackler family made a more targeted gift, establishing Tufts Masters of Science in Pain Research, Education, and Policy (\"MSPREP Program\").230 Kathe Sackler co -presided over the decision to fund the MSPREP Program.231 Richard Sackler attended the launch symposium in Boston and paid Tufts hundreds of thousands of dollars.232 Purdue also sponsored the annual Sackler Lecture at Tufts on a topic in pain medicine.233 For many ye ars, Richard took a seat on the board of the Tufts University School of Medicine. 280. The Sacklers got a lot for their money. The MSPREP Program bought Purdue name recognition, goodwill in the local and medical communities, and access to doctors at Massachusetts hospitals like Brigham and Women's.234 Purdue got to control research on the treatment of pain coming out of a prominent and respected institution of learning.235 Staff told the Sacklers that Purdue employees regularly taught a Tufts seminar about opioids in Massachusetts as part of the MSPREP Program.236 Staff sent the Sacklers a report showing that Tufts and its affiliated teaching hospital helped Purdue develop a publication for patients 230 1999- 07-10 email from Richard Sackler, #212166.1 ; memorandum dated May 7, 2000, PPLPC013000048630. 231 1999- 07-07 attendance list for the Meeting to discuss funding, PPLPC013000029936. 232 1999- 10-13 email from Richard report, pg. 16, PDD89017339 94 entitled, \"Taking Control of Your Pain.\"237 The MSPREP Program was such a success for Purdue's business that the company considered it a model for influencing teaching hospitals and medical schools.238 281. A May 2000 Tufts site visit memorandum from Purdue staff, sent to Richard Sackler and others, listed many of the lasting be nefits of the relationship Purdue had with Tufts. The purposes of the visit were, in part: to address a complaint the Sacklers had about the prominence and placement of the Purdue logo on the Tufts MSPREP materials; to \"explore ways in which PPLP [Purdue Pharma L.P.] can contribute academically to the curriculum of the MSPREP Program;\" and to find opportunities for Purdue to influence the work of Tufts in the Massachusetts medical marketplace and beyond.239 282. In a tour of Tufts Medical Center in Boston, Purdue and Tufts employees \"discussed ways in which they could better coordinate their activities... to raise consciousness of better pain control,\" presented doctors with metrics developed by Purdue for \"studies of analgesics that go beyond an acute observation,\" and discussed curriculum for training physicians. Purdue staff met with a Tufts nurse who was recruiting patients for a Purdue clinical project, toured the project lab, and discussed a research protocol that Purdue helped to write . Purdue staff told Tuf ts that \"one way in which the Program could function better from the PPLP [Purdue Pharma LP] perspective was to have a designated contact person ... to coordinate requests for preceptorships of PPLP employees.\" Tufts said that Purdue employees were welcome at its Boston -based medical school and its affiliated hospital in Western 237 2000 Budget Submission, pg. 58, PDD1701809 250. 238 2000- 05-30 email from Robert 239 2000- 05-07 memorandum, PPLPC013000048630. 95 Massachusetts.240 283. Purdue also obtained an agreement from Tufts to sponsor programs \"in response to the situation in Maine.\"241 Around the time of that visit, Purdue and the Sacklers knew of damning reports of addiction and overdose in Maine caused by Purdue's opioids.242 Tufts ran a residency program for family practice physicians and agreed to help Purdue find doctors to attend an event where Purdue could defend its reputation.243 284. Richard Sackler communicated with the Director of the MSPREP Program, encouraged him to visit Purdue's offices, and offered to send Purdue marketing staff to visit him in Boston.244 The MSPREP steering committee w ent to Purdue headquarters in 2009 to learn what Purdue would like to see in the MSPREP Program.245 285. Purdue regularly sent staff to Tufts, including in the years 2007, 2010, 2013, 2015, and 2017.246 Tufts promoted a Purdue employee to Adjunct Associate Profess or in 2011.247 The Director of the MSPREP Program provided comments favorable to Purdue at FDA meetings in 2012 and 2013, and Purdue staff tracked it all in a grid.248 Richard Sackler arranged for a Tufts professor to meet with Purdue staff in 2012.249 In 2014, Purdue's medical liaison staff succeeded in getting two Purdue unbranded curricula approved for teaching to Tufts students \u2014 future residents, fellows, and clinicians.

The marketing benefits that the Sacklers reaped from Tufts were so great that they offered to send Purdue's CEO to Massachusetts to sustain the courtship . As recently as November 2017, CEO Craig Landau wrote to Tufts' President to promote Purdue's cont entions about opioids and offer to meet .251 287. The Sacklers' high -profile involvement at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Tufts University was part of their misconduct. These marquee projects also confirm the obvious truth that the Sacklers knew and inte nded that Purdue promoted opioids in Massachusetts. 2010 288. In January 2010, Richard Sackler started the year by asking sales staff for new customized reports.252 Staff complained to each other until Sales VP Russell Gasdia asked CEO John Stewart to intervene: \" Can you help with this? It seems like every week we get one off requests from Dr . Richard .\"253 Neither Stewart nor anyone else could keep Richard out of sales.254 Days later, Richard was writing to the sales employee on Saturday m orning, ordering that his need to review the sales plan was \"urgent\" and should be satisfied \"this weekend.\"255 289. In February , Purdue's Sales and Marketing Department told the Sackler s that a key objective for 2010 would be to \"Meet or exceed total prescriber call targets of 545,000\" 250 2014- 04-09 email from Thomas Currier, PPLPC022000712807. 251 11-13 letter from Craig Landau, PPLPC021000912691. 252 01-05 email from Richard Sackler, PPLPC023000259671.

For the next four years or more , a key objective for the sales employees was to meet a quota of sales visits, and the Sacklers tracked their performance. The target rose from 545,000 prescriber visits in 2010, to 712,000 visits in 2011, 752,417 visits in 2012, and 744,777 visits in 2013. 256 290. To achieve the target for sales visits, staff told the Sacklers that another sales force expansion ordered by the Board had been implemented and Purdue employed 490 sales reps. 257 That expansion was having the intended effect in Massachusetts. D uring Q4 2009, Purdue reps visited Massachusetts prescribers more than 2,800 times, a 25% increase over the same quarter the year before. 258 291. Staff also told the Sackler s .259 .\" .260 In fact, becoming addicted to opioids makes patients more stressed, more isolated, and less likely to survive. 292.

In March , Richard Sackler instructed sales staff to send him monthly reports on sales of OxyContin and its competitors. They complied within ten minutes.262 The report showed that Purdue was selling more pills of its 80mg OxyContin (the highest dose) than any other dose, and that t he highest dose pills were responsible for the greatest share of Purdue's revenue by far.263 294. Staff also told .264 Deceptively promoting opioids for opioid-naive patients who had not taken them before was one of the ways Purdue put patients at risk. 295. In April , the Sackler s .265 296. Meanwhile, staff told the Sackler s that they were pushing back against the \"threat\" of public health rules that would limit high doses of opioids. They told the Sackler s that Purdue would oppose precautions that asked doctors to consult with specialists before prescr ibing the highest doses.266 297. In Massachusetts, Purdue was pushing high doses with great success. A t that moment, Purdue's top-paid physician spokesman in Massachusetts, Walter Jacobs, had a patient on twenty -four pills of 80mg OxyContin per day \u2014 almost a hu ndred times more drug that the starting dose on the label. For all of 2010, 73% of the OxyContin pills that Jacobs prescribed were the highest -dose 80mg pills. Purdue paid Jacobs to give presentations to other doctors so that his dangerous prescribing pr actices would spread. 262 2010- 03-15 email s from Richard Sackler and Mike Innaurato , PPLPC012000262889. 263 2010- 03-11 January 2010 slides 10, 15, PPLPC012000262892. 264 2010- 03-17 Executive Committee notes, Board PKY183212829. 266 2010- 04-21 Board report, pg. 16, PWG000423155. 99 The Sacklers' Control of Sales Visits 298. That same month (April 2010), staff gave the Sacklers one of many detailed reports on sales reps' visits to prescribers. As with every reference to \"the Sacklers\" before July 2012, that includes Beverly, Ilene, Jonathan, Kathe, Mortimer, Richard, and Theresa Sackler. 299. The Sacklers required each rep to visit an average of 7.5 prescribers per day. In April 2010, staff report ed that they were falling short. During Q1 2010, reps had averaged only 7.0 visits per day.267 Staff promised to try harder. The Sacklers continued to set a target for daily sales visits for every sales rep , and they tracked the results, quarter by quarte r, for at least the next four years. The results were always close to 7 visits per day.

The Sacklers also set targets for the total number of sales visits by the entire sales force per quarter \u2014 huge numbers that were always more than a hundred thousand visits. Meeting those targets was a top priority for the entire company. For Q1 2010, the target was to visit prescribers 127,376 times. S taff told the Sacklers that Purdue employed 489 sales reps and that, during Q1 2010, they achieved the goal. 268 As with the daily visits per rep, the Sackle rs tracked the total number of sales visits per quarter, every quarter, for at least the next four years.

During every quarter, sales reps visited prescribers in Massachusetts. Indeed, they visited every month, every week, and almost every day. During Q1 2010, Purdue sales reps visited Massachusetts prescribers more than 2,700 times.269 302. The Sackler s also tracked the cost of the sales visits. In April 2010, staff reported to the Sackler s that each vis it to a prescriber cost Purdue $219, and they were working to lower the cost to a target of $201.270 For the people of Massachusetts, the costs were far higher. 303. In June 2010, staff gave the Sacklers an updated 10-year plan for growing Purdue's opioid sales. . Beginning on page one, staff emphasized that selling as many opioids as the Sacklers wanted \"will require significant salesforce support\" so the plan detailed the \"optimization\" of sales visits and the number of reps they would require. Sales VP Gasdia wrote to the Sacklers that they planned for each rep to visit prescribers 1,540 times per year, so that 500 reps could make 770,000 visits at a cost of $212 per visit . He proposed to grow the sales force to 1,050 sales reps by 2015. To reach the Sacklers' expectations, Gasdia projected that Purdue would convince doctors to switch patients from Tylenol to Purdue's soon- to-be-released Butrans opioid, and Butrans would a billion- dollar drug. 271 304. In July , Richard Sackler emailed staff just before the July 4th holiday weekend to demand more details about sales and marketing. Richard directed them to send to the Board plans for \"the marketing program\" and \"the sales program,\" with instructions to \"get this out 269 Exhibit 1. 270 2010- 04-21 Board report, pg. 4, PWG000423143. 271 2010- 06-24 Purdue Pharma 2010 10 -Year Plan, pgs. 1 -15, Key Assumptions pg. 6, PPLPC012000277155-1 69, - 217. 102 before the weekend.\"272 A despondent staff member wrote to the CEO: \"Are you expecting us to provide the marketing plan by tomorrow?\"273 Staff came close to telling Richard Sackler no. Instead, they negotiated an extension and promised to provide full details about sales and marketing at the July Board meeting in Bermuda.274 To enforce the deal, Kathe Sackler ordered staff to circulate materials before the meeting.275 305. By the Sacklers' choice, sitting on the Board of Purdue Pharma Inc. was a globe- trotting endeavor. The Sacklers .276 306. In Bermuda, the Sacklers focused on sales tactics again . Staff presented plans for selling Purdue's new Butrans opioid. Staff reported that sales reps would try to switch patients to opioids from NSAIDs like ibuprofen and explained tactics for convinc ing doctors that patients needed the new drug. Staff told the Sacklers that they had identified 82,092 prescribers to target with the Butrans sales campaign. Staff reported that they planned to add 125 sales reps and increase the number of prescriber visits by 30%. 277 307. Emails between staff and the Sacklers . The Board asked .

The reports of inappropriate prescribing that staff reported to the Board were accurate. No one knew more about prescribing of Purdue opioids than Purdue. A year after Purdue staff told the Board about Alvin Chua, the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine took away his license for improper opioid prescribing.286 Three years after Purdue told the Board about Michael Tayl or, he lost his license and was convicted in Massachusetts court of prescribing opioids without a legitimate medical purpose.287 By then, Purdue and the Sacklers had collected hundreds of thousands of dollars from their dangerous prescriptions.

Later that month, staff told the Sackler s that Purdue employed 491 sales reps and that, during Q2 2010, they visited prescribers 135,824 times.291 More than 2,500 of those visits were in Massachusetts.292 Meanwhile, staff .293 318. In August , the Sacklers continued to focus on the sales force. That month, they decided not to acquire a new insomnia drug because of the risk that promoting it could distract sales reps from selling Purdue's opioids. Richard Sackler concluded that \"loss of focus\" in sales reps' meetings with prescribers was too great a risk, and the Sacklers decided not to go through with the deal. 294 319. A few days later, the Sacklers discussed abuse of OxyContin. Staff told them that the most common way of abusing oxycodone, by far, w as swallowing it \u2014 which a crush -proof coating on OxyContin did not affect. Staff also reported to the Sackler s that data from the Massachusetts prescription monitoring program showed far higher rates of \"doctor-shopping\" for OxyContin prescriptions than for any other opioid.295 The prescription monitoring program identifies \"doctor -shopping\" when a patient gets opioids from multiple prescribers \u2014 an indication that the patient is at risk of addiction, overdose, and death. 320. In September, staff reported to the Sackler s about the Board's July 2010 decision to hire more sales reps. Staff said they were working to implement the decision, adding 125 291 2010- 07-27 Board report, pg s. 5, 27, PWG000422481, -503. Staff told the Sacklers that the target for visits was 142,657; that reps visited 7.0 prescribers per day, on average, compared to the target of 7.5; that the average cost of a visit was $219; and that they were still working to lower the cost to $201. 292 Exhibit 1. 293 2010- 07-27 Board report, pg. 18, PWG000422494. 294 email from Richard Sackler, PPLPC012000283047. 295 08-16 email from Stuart Baker, PPLPC012000283342- 43; 2010 -08-19 presentation by Paul Coplan, slide s 7, 31, PPLPC012000283469. 108 sales territories.296 Staff also told the Sackler s that 82% of prescriptions for OxyContin were to patients who were already on the drug \u2014 a key ingredient in Purdue's plans to keep patients on opioids longer.297 The Sackler s .298 321. In October, s taff told the Sackler s that Purdue employed 506 sales reps and, during Q3 2010, they visited prescribers 141,116 times.299 More than 2,600 of those visits were in Massachusetts.300 322. Meanwhile, staff told .301 The Sackler s .302 323. That same month, s taff told the Sackler s that Purdue was promoting opioids at more than a dozen programs in Massachusetts, including: an $85,000 program on opioids at Tufts University; a $50,000 program on opioid prescribing for chronic pain at Boston University; a $50,000 program on customized opioid treatments at the Pri- Med Institute (a company specializing in continuing medical education) in Massachusetts; another $45,000 program on opioids for chronic pain at the Pri- Med Institute in Massachusetts; a $15,000 program on pain management at Northeastern University; a $10,000 program at the Massachusetts College of Executive Committee ell 2010- 09-10 Board minutes, PKY183212844. 299 2010- 10-25 Board report, pg s. 3, 26, PWG000421967, -990.

In November, staff warned the Sackler s that doctors were not prescribing Purdue's highest dose and most profitable opioids as much as the company had expected, so it might be necessary to cut the family's quarter-end payout from and distribute it in two parts: one in early December and one closer to the end of the month.304 Mortimer Sackler obje cted to the decrease and the division into two payments, and he demanded answers from staff : \"Why are you BOTH reducing the amount of the distribution and delaying it and splitting it in two?\" \"Just a few weeks ago you agreed to distribute the full .\"305 303 2010- 10-07 report attached to email by William Ma llin, pgs. 3, 5, 10, 13, 16, 26, 28, William Ma llin, PPLPC012000292759-7 60. 304 2010- 11-23 683. 305 2010- 11-23 and 2010 -11-24 email s from Mortimer Sackler, PPLPC012000299869 -870. 110 325.

In January 2011, Richard Sackler met with sales reps for several days at the Butrans Launch Meeting and discussed how they would promote Purdue's newest opioid.310 Richard quickly followed up with sales management to demand a briefing on how the sales visits were going in the field: \"I'd like a briefing on the field experience and intelligence regarding Butrans. How are we doing, are we encountering the resistance that we expected and how well are we overcoming it, and are the responses similar to, better, or worse than when we marketed OxyContin\u00ae tablets?\" 311 329. Richard's interventions into sales tactics made employees nervous.

Two hours after sending his request, Richard ordered Sales VP Russell Gasdia to call him , on a Sunday morning, on his cell phone.313 Richard wanted to discuss \"the resistance\" and how Purdue's sale s reps were \"overcoming \" it right away. 331. Richard Sackler kept pushing for more sales. After one week of prescriptions doubled Purdue's forecast, Richard wrote to the sales staff: \"I had hoped for better results .\"314 In a follow -up message, Richard asked staff to tell him the ratio of prescriptions per sales representative visit to a prescriber, divided out by the prescribers' specialties. He asked for a Board discussion of the barriers that sales reps were encountering during promotion.315 After trying to answer Richard's questions and getting another dissatisfied response, sales staff wrote to the CEO to ask him to intervene.316 In a later message, Richard wrote to the staff again: \"What do I have to do to get a weekly report on Butrans sales without having t o ask for it?\"317 One exasperated staff member begged another to respond.318 The CEO announced that, from then on, staff would send a sales report to the Sacklers every week .319 When staff sent the first weekly report, Richard responded immediately: \"What els e more can we do to energize the sales and grow at a faster rate?\"320 The next week, Richard wrote to the sales staff to ask about the performance of a specific sales rep.321 312 2011- 01-31 email from John Stewart, PPLPC021000352205. from Richard Sackler, PPLPC012000308371. from Richard Sackler, PPLPC012000311654. email from Richard Sackler, PPLPC012000313544. from Russell Gasdia, PPLPC012000313542. from Richard from Mike Innaurato, John Stewart, email from Richard Sackler, PPLPC012000316128. 2011- 03-22 email from Richard Sackler, PPLPC012000317190. 112 332. Mortimer Sackler jumped in, asking staff for more information about sales. When two days passed without an answer, Mortimer insisted: \"Any answer to this yet?\"322 Staff rushed to prepare answers to share with all the Sacklers.323 333. The people who worked for the Sacklers knew their appetite for sales was extreme. When the launch of Purdue's Butrans opioid was on track to beat every drug in its class, Richard Sackler asked sales staff: \"Do you share my disappointment?\"324 Sales VP Russell Gasdia replied privately to the CEO: \"A s far as his disappointment, I do not share that.\"325 334. Throughout that spring of 2011, the Sacklers . In January, the Sackler s 326 The Sackler s In September 2009, a Purdue sales manager had emailed Crowley that Purdue was promoting opioids to an illegal pill mill: \"I feel very certain this is an organized drug ring,\" and \"Shouldn't the DEA be contacted about this?\" Purdue sat on the information and did not report it to the authorities for more than two years , until after the pill mill doctor had already been arrested and the Sacklers had arranged for lawyers in case Crowley was questioned . 327 322 2011- 04-05 and 2011 -04-08 email s from Mortimer Sackler, PPLPC012000320102- 103. 323 2011- 04-08 email from Russell Gasdia, PPLPC012000320101. from Richard minutes, PKY1832128 \" More than 1 M illion OxyContin Pills Ended up in the Hands of C riminals and A ddicts.

In January 2011, staff reported to the Sacklers that a key initiative in Q4 2010 had been the expansion of the sales force. S taff told the Sackler s that Purdue employed 590 sales reps and, during Q4 2010, they visited prescribers 125,712 times.328 More than 2,900 of those visits were in Massachusetts.329 336. Staff told . But staff reported that Purdue's revenue was still hundreds of millions of dollars less than expected because doctors were prescribing less of Purdue's highest dose opioids.330 Staff told the Sacklers that sales of the highest doses continued to fall below expectations, and the gap had cost the company $120,000,000 in the month of December 2010 alone. 331 The Sacklers faced the prospect that, if doctors did not prescribe more of the highe st doses, their payouts would shrink. 337. In February , staff reported to the Sackler s that law enforcement was increasingly concerned about lawbreaking by drug companies and the resulting \"danger to public safety.\"332 Staff also told the Sackler s that Purdue was receiving a rising volume of hotline calls and other compliance matters, reaching an all -time high during Q4 2010. Staff reported to the Sackler s that sales reps had engaged in improper promotion of Purdue opioids, but the company had decided not to report the violations to the government. Staff also reported to the Sackler s about the risks of OxyContin, including that 83% of patients in substance abuse treatment centers began abusing opioids by swallowing pills, and that it took, on average, 20 months for a patient to get treatment. Staff reported to the Sackler s that Purdue tracked to individual zip codes the 328 2011- 01-24 Board report, pg s. 4, 5, 35, PWG000421 551, -552, -582. Staff told the Sacklers that, at the Board's direction, Purdue had hired 74 more sales reps and planned to hire 51 more . Staff told the Sacklers that the sales rep visits compared to a ta rget for the quarter of 125,553 visits; and that reps visited 6.2 prescribers per day, on average, compared to a target of 7.5; and that each visit cost Purdue $219. They were still working to lower the cost to $201. 329 Exhibit 1. 330 2011- 01-24 Board report, pg. 22, PWG000421569.

Staff even gave the Sackler s a map correlating dangerous prescribers in Massachusetts with reports of oxycodone poisonings, burglaries, and robberies .334 Map presen ted to the Purdue Board in 2011 339. In March , staff reported to the Sacklers on OxyContin sales and again focused on revenue from doctors in Region Zero \u2014 prescribers that Purdue suspected of improper prescribing but that Purdue had not reported to the authori ties. Staff told the Sacklers that if 333 2011- 02-03 presentation by Bert Weinstein, slides 22 -24, -95, PDD890146803 6-038, -100, -108-109. 334 2011- 02-03 presentation by Bert Weinstein, slide 95, PDD8901468109. 115 Region Zero doctors stopped prescribing opioids, Purdue would lose almost 10% of its sales.335 340. In April , the Sacklers met with Sales VP Russell Gasdia to talk about sales. He told them that OxyContin was the best- selling painkiller in America, with more than three billion dollars in annual sales \u2014almost double the second-place drug.336 The Sacklers .337 341. In May , in response to the Sacklers' repeated requests, staff sent Richard, Jonathan, Kathe, Mortimer, and Theresa Sackler a report on the sales tactics reps were using to push Butrans. The first tactic reported to the se Sacklers was focusing on a select \"core\" of physicians that Purdue calculated would be most susceptible to sales reps lobbying to prescribe more opioids.338 In Massachusetts, the prescribers Purdue identified as \"core\" include Dr. Conrad Benoit, Dr. Yoon Choi, Dr. Fernando Jayma, and Dr. Fathalla Mashali.339 Purdue sales reps repeatedly reported concerns that these doctors wrote inappropriate prescriptions, but Purdue ordered the reps to keep promoting opioids to these doctors anyway. Dozens of their patients overdosed and died. 342. The second tactic staff reported to Richard, Jonathan, Kathe, Mortimer, and Theresa Sackler in the May 25, 2011 email was \"positioning of Butrans for specific patient types.\" 340 In Massachusetts, promotion for \"specific patient types\" meant pushing opioids for elderly patients with arthritis. Sales reps recorded in their notes that they urged Massachusetts doctors to prescribe opioids for elderly patients more than a thousand times in 2011. The reps 335 2011- 03-01 2011 OxyContin Tablets Sales Trends and Gasdia, 2013 Q1 target 340 2011- 05-25 email from Russell Gasdia, PPLPC012000326017. 116 even went to pharmacies to ask Massachusetts pharmacists to encourage doctors to prescribe opioids for the elderly. 343. A third tactic reported to the se five Sacklers was getting prescribers to commit to put specific patients on opioids.341 In Massachusetts, sales reps recorded in their notes that they asked doctors to commit to prescribe opioids more than a thousand times in 2011. Massachusetts sales reps repeatedly asked prescribers to commit to prescribe opioids without disclosing significant risks. 344. Jonathan Sackler was not satisfied that these tactics wo uld be enough to boost sales. He wrote to John Stewart : \"this is starting to look ugly. Let's talk.\"342 Stewart and the sales team scrambled to put together a response and set up a meeting with Jonathan for the following week. 343 345. That same month, staff repo rted to the Sacklers that Purdue had hired 47 more sales reps . Staff told the Sackler s that Purdue employed 639 sales reps and, during Q1 2011, they visited prescribers 173,647 times.344 More than 3,800 of those visits were in Massachusetts.345 346. Meanwhile, the Sackler s .346 The Sackler s were on notice that Purdue's unfair and deceptive marketing rais ed serious concerns. Staff also 341 2011- 05-25 email from Russell Gasdia, PPLPC012000326017. from Jonathan Sackler, PPLPC012000326194. 05-25 email from John Stewart, PPLPC012000326193. 344 2011- 05-02 Board report, pg s. 5, 6, 36, PPLPC012000322430, -431, -461.

In June , staff reported to the Sackler s .348 The headline presented at the Board meeting read: \"40 and 80mg tablet prescriptions have decreased significan tly. The 10mg and 20mg tablet prescriptions initially increased, but given their lower value not enough to offset the higher strength decline.\" Staff told the Sacklers: \"As a result of the change in prescriptions by strength, OxyContin brand Kgs dispensed are below mid 2010 levels.\" Staff reported to the Sacklers that Purdue would rely on sales rep visits and paid physician spokespersons to maintain demand. For a \"Super Core\" of \"Very High Potential\" opioid prescribers, Purdue would order its sales reps to make sales visits every week. 349 348. The Sacklers immediately pushed to find ways to increase sales. Richard Sackler asked Sales VP Russell Gasdia to include him in a meeting with District Managers who were the day-to-day supervisors of the sales reps. Then, having missed the meeting, he engaged Gasdia again by email. Gasdia told Richard that Purdue had hired 147 new sales reps at the Board's direction. Gasdia told Richard that Purdue instructed the sales reps to focus on converting patients who had never been on opioids or patients taking \"low dose Vicodin, Percocet, or tramadol\" \u2014 all patients for whom Purdue's opioids posed an increase in risk. 350 349. Sales reps reported to Purdue that they encouraged Massachusetts doctors to prescribe opioids to opioid-naive patients more than a thousand times in 2011. 347 2011- 05-20 compliance report, PPLP004406033. 348 2011- 05-12 Executive from Russell Gasdia, PPLPC012000329609. 118 350. Gasdia told Richard Sackler (again) that Purdue instructed sales reps to focus on the few highest -prescribing doctors in their territory and visit them over and over. Gasdia also told Richard that staff had initiated performance enhancement plans for sales reps who were not generating enough opioid prescriptions.351 In Massachusetts, a sales rep was put on a performance enhancement plan and ordered to visit 10 specific prescribers twice every week and increase prescriptions by 43% .352 Another Massachusetts rep was ordered to increase prescriptions by 62%.353 Purdue issued a performance enhancement plan to another Massachusetts sales rep that said: \"Anticipated Challenges: Dr. trying to cut down on opioid prescribing due to abuse.\" \" Action Steps: Sell for patients they are willing to Rx opioids ...(elderly).\"354 Purdue also ordered the rep to do a better job using gifts (\"coffee, lunch\") to buy time with Massachusetts prescribers and reminded her that Purdue had a budget for that purpose.355 351. Purdue put two other Massachusetts rep s on probation and threatened to fire them because the doctors they visited did not put enough patients on opioids. Purdue told them that the only way they could keep their job s was by generating more opioid sales.356 352. In response to Gasdia 's message about the sales reps, Richard Sackler wrote back six minutes later and asked to meet with Gasdia without delay.357 Gasdia scrambled to schedule 351 2011- 06-16 email from Russell Gasdia, PPLPC012000329609. 352 Performance Enhancement Plan, PPLPC01400023142 6 (\"See Top 10 HCPs each Monday.

Richard Sackler continued the correspondence that day, criticizing Purdue's managers for allowing sales reps to target \"non -high potential prescribers.\" \"How can our managers have allowed this to happen?\"360 Richard insisted that sales reps push the doctors who prescribed the most drugs . 354. To make sure his orders were followed, Richard Sackler demanded to be sent into the field with the sales reps.361 Richard wanted a week shadowing Purdue sales reps, two reps per day. In horror, Gasdia appealed to Purdue's Chief Compliance Officer , warning that Richard Sackler promoting opioids was \"a p otential compliance risk.\"362 Compliance replied: \"LOL.\"363 To make sure the Sacklers' involvement in marketing stayed secret , staff instructed: \"Richard needs to be mum and from Richard Sackler, PPLPC012000329706. from Richard email from Russell Gasdia, PPLPC012000329494 (\"Based on our discussions, perhaps you could sit down with JS on your thoughts.

A slew of executives, including the CEO, got involved in planning Richard Sackler's sales visits. A ll of them were worried. One wrote: \"About 5 last night, John [Stewart, the CEO] was walking by my office - I yelled out to stop him - and said that you had mentioned to me that Richard wanted to go into the field, and that you had raised concerns with me. John seemed angry, and asked if I had concerns. I told him could be issues and Richard could be out on a limb if he spoke about product at all or got into conversations with HCPs, or identified h imself, especially with FDA Bad Ad possibilities. John agreed Richard would have to be mum throughout, and not identify himself other than as a home office person.\" 364 364 2011- 07-17 email from Bert Weinstein, PPLPC012000329783. 121 356. Richard Sackler indeed went into the field to promote opioids to doctors alongside a sales rep. When he returned, Richard argued to the Vice President of Sales that a legally - required warning about Purdue's opioids wasn't needed. He asserted that the warning \"implies a danger of untoward reactions and hazards that simply aren't there .\" Richard insisted there should be \"less threatening\" ways to describe Purdue opioids.365 357. Meanwhile, the Sackler s .366 358. A few days later , sales and marketing staff scrambled to prepare responses to questions from the Sacklers. Mortimer Sackler asked about launching a generic version of OxyContin to \"capture more cost sensitive patients.\" Kathe Sackler recommended looking at the characteristics of patients who had switched to OxyContin to see if Purdue could identify more patients to convert . Jonathan Sackler wanted to study changes in market share for opioids, focusing on dose strength. 367 359. At the same time, sales staff were organizing more ways for Richard Sackler t o oversee their work in the field. Gasdia proposed to Richard: \"In addition to field contacts with representatives, you may want to consider attending one of the upcoming conventions where we will be attending. At each of the ones listed below, we will ha ve a promotional booth for OxyContin & Butrans. In addition, we are sponsoring educational programs for Butrans and OxyContin in the form of a 'Product Theater.' This would provide you the opportunity to be on the convention floor, observing numerous presentations being provided by our representatives and see a wide range of interactions over the course of a day. In addition, we can arrange for one-on-one meetings with key opinion leaders who are attending, many of them are approved consultants/advisors for us and you can have some open conversations regarding the market, perceptions around Butrans 365 2011- 07-20 email from Richard Sackler, Mahony, PPLPC012000331343; attachment PPLPC012000331345. 122 and OxyContin. Finally, you could observe the Product Theaters we are implementing.\"368 360. In July , staff assured the Sacklers that Purdue prohibited sales reps fr om writing their sales pitches to prescribers in email.369 The Sacklers believed that promoting opioids in oral conversations with doctors, and banning employee email, would protect them from investigations of their misconduct. 361. In August , staff told the Sackler s that Purdue employed 640 sales reps and, during Q2 2011, they visited prescribers 189,650 times.370 More than 4,500 of those visits were in Massachusetts.371 362. Meanwhile, staff reported to the Sackler s .372 363. In September, Richard Sackler directed staff to study a savings card program for a widely -used cholesterol medication (not an addictive narcotic) to learn how Purdue could use it for opioids.373 That same month, the Sackler s .374 364. In November, s taff told the Sackler s that Purdue still employed 640 sales reps and, during Q3 2011, they visited prescribers 189,698 times.375 More than 4,100 of those visits were in Massachusetts.376 Looking ahead, the Sacklers 368 Board report, pg s. 6, 42, PWG000420318, -354.

In January 2012, Jonathan S ackler started the year press ing Sales VP Russell Gasdia for weekly updates on sales.379 A few days later, Richard Sackler jumped into the weeds with the sales staff, this time about advertising. Richard noticed that online ads appeared indiscriminately on webpages with content associated with the ad \u2014 regardless of whether the association was positive or negative.380 Staff assured Richard that, when Purdue bought online advertising for opioids, it specified that the ads appear only on pages expressing positive views toward opioids, and would not appear with articles \"about how useless or damaging or dangerous is our product that we are trying to promote.\" 381 367. That same month, s taff told the Sackler s that Purdue employed 632 sales reps and, during Q4 2011, they visited prescribers 165,994 times.382 More than 3,600 of those visits were in Massachusetts.383 368. The Sacklers were not satisfied with the sales effort. In February , staff reported to the Sacklers that prescriptions had dropped, and that a decrease in sales rep visits to 377 2011- 11-18 Board minutes, 2012 budget, PKY183212941 -942; 2012 budget submission, pg. 22, PDD9273201436. 378 2011- Board report, pg. 26, PWG000419328 . email from Jonathan Sackler, from Richard Sackler, Board report, pg s. 7, 48, PPLPC012000362250, -291.

S taff asked the Sacklers to be patient, because reps had missed work for December holidays and the company's mandatory National Sales Meeting in January.384 Mortimer Sackler was not pleased. He suggested that, \"in future years we should not plan the national sales meeting so close following the winter break as it extends the period of time since the doctor last saw our rep.\" Mortimer wrote: \"Wouldn't it be b etter to have the reps get back to work for January and back in front of doctors.\"385 Mortimer was agitated by the thought of doctors going too many days without a sales rep visiting to promot e Purdue opioids. If Purdue rescheduled its meeting, \"At least t hen the doctors will have gotten at least one reminder visit from our reps in the last month whereas now they might go two months without seeing one of our reps??\" S taff replied to Mortimer, arguing for \"balance.\" 386 Richard Sackler replied within minutes that, since the National Sales Meeting prevented sales reps from visiting doctors, \"Maybe the thing to have done was not have the meeting at all.\"387 Purdue's compliance officer forwarded the exchange to his staff, commenting: \"Oh dear.\"388 369. Meanwhile, Richard from Mortimer Russell Richard email from Bert Weinstein, PPLPC026000095655. 389 2012- 02-02 and 2012 -02-03 emails from Richard Sackler, PPLPC021000439058, PPLPC021000439090; see also 2012- 02-22 emails from Richard Sackler, William from Russell Gasdia, 370. Richard Sackler .392 Employees .393 , Purdue's Chief Medical Officer Craig Landau . Landau's assistant wrote: \" .\"394 Purdue staff knew that people would bend the rules when Richard Sackler wanted something. 371. Throughout the spring, the Sackler s pressed staff to promote Purdue's opioids more aggressively. In February, Gasdia wrote to sales staff that the Board of Directors (\"BOD\") was not satisfied with the money coming in: \"Things are not good at the BOD level.\"395 When sales dropped for one week on account of the Presidents' Day holiday, Richard Sackler wrote to sales management: \"This is bad.\"396 Gasdia forwarded Richard's message to his colleagues, asking how they could \" create a greater sense of urgency at the regional management and district management level. \"397 372. The sales manager who reported to Gasdia had an immediate answer \u2014 aimed straight at Massachusetts. That same night, he drafted a message to the leader of Purdue's 392 2012- 02-14 email from Richard Donna email from Richard 397 2012- 02-07 email from Russell Gasdia, PPLPC012000368430. 126 Boston district. He wrote: \"the Boston District is failing.\" Then the sales manager went person by person through a list of Massachusetts sales reps and criticized them for not increasing opioid prescriptions enough. H e emphasized that the pressure was coming from Richard Sackler himself: \"Russ, as well as Mike and myself are constantly defending the launch of Butrans to BOD members. Just today, Dr. Richard sent another email 'This is bad,' referring to current Butrans trends. I am quite sure that Dr. Richard would not be sympathetic to the plight of the Boston District.\" The manager ended his email by threatening to fire every sales rep in Boston: \"I must tell you that I am much closer to dismissing the entire district than agreeing that they deserve a pass for poor market conditions.\" 398 The manager sent his draft to Gasd ia, who asked him to run it by someone in marketing. Gasdia agreed that they should consider firing the sales reps, because \"that will send a message.\"399 373. Meanwhile, Gasdia pleaded with the CEO to defend him against R ichard Sackler's micromanagement of sales: \"Anything you can do to reduce the direct contact of Richard into the organization is appreciated. \"400 A week later, Richard wrote to sales management again to criticize them for U.S. sales being \"among the worst\" in the world.401 374. In March , staff .402 375. On one Saturday morning, Richard Sackler wrote to marketing staff, demanding monthly data for all extended release pain medications for the past twelve years and an 398 2012- 02-07 email from Windell Fisher, from Russell 03-05 email from Edward Mahony, PPLPC012000368627. 127 immediate meeting that Monday night.403 Gasdia and Stewart stood by helpless, writing: \"Do let us know how this goes.\"404 Later that month, staff created for Richard a historical summary of key events determining OxyCont in sales. Eleven of the key events in sales history were changes in the size of the Purdue sales force \u2014 all known to Richard because the Sacklers had ordered them.405 376. A few days later, staff sent Richard Sackler an assessment of recently -improved opioid sa les. Staff told Richard that the increase in prescriptions was caused by tactics that Purdue taught sales reps : pushing opioids for elderly patients with arthritis (\"proper patient selection\") and encouraging doctors to use higher doses of opioids (\"quick titration\").406 In the coming months, Purdue would study, document, and expand the use of higher doses to increase sales \u2014 a tactic that helped to kill people in Massachusetts. 377. Richard Sackler wrote that he was not satisfied with a report on sales and instructed Gasdia to discuss it with him within a day.407 Gasdia scrambled to schedule the meeting.408 Then Richard raised the stakes and asked Gasdia to address both Butrans sales tactics and a decline in OxyContin sales and propose corrective actions.409 John S tewart suggested that Richard's frustrations could be linked to dosing: he encouraged Gasdia to tell Richard that patients on lower doses seemed to stop taking opioids sooner, and that much of the profit that Purdue had lost had been from doctors backing off the highest dose of OxyContin (80mg).410 403 2012- 03-17 email from Richard David Rosen, PPLPC012000371301. 407 2012- 04-12 from Richard Sack ler, email from Russell from Richard Sackler, PPLPC012000372585. 410 2012- 04-16 email from John Stewart, PPLPC012000372620. 128 378. Richard Sackler was not satisfied. Days later, after sales did not increase, staff told him that they were starting quantitative research to determine why patients stay on opioids , so they could find ways to sell more opioids at higher doses for longer .411 379. In April , staff told the Sackler s that Purdue employed 630 sales reps and, during Q1 2012, they visited prescribers 179,554 times.412 More than 3,800 of those visits were in Massachusetts.413 380. Meanwhile, Richard Sackler kept push ing the staff to increase sales. When the mandatory weekly report to the Sa cklers showed that sales reps achieved 9,021 prescriptions in a week, Richard asked Sales VP Russell Gasdia for a commitment that the reps would get weekly prescriptions to 10,000: \" Are you committed to breaking 10K/wk Rx' s this month? \"414 A colleague repli ed incredulously to Gasdia: \"Is there any question of your commitment?\"415 Even for people who worked in sales, Richard's conviction that sales reps should just make doctors prescribe opioids seemed crazy . 381. Gasdia tried to assure Richard Sackler that they were selling opioids aggressively: \"Windell and the sales force, as well as Mike and the marketing team (initiatives being implemented) are focused and committed to accelerating the growth trend ... everyone in the commercial organization is focused on exceedi ng the annual forecast.\"416 Richard wanted more. Richard wanted to know what tactics sales staff would use to get more prescriptions, and he wanted to talk about it right away.

Then show how you plan to make up the current shortfall .\"417 Then he asked for a meeting within 24 hours.418 Then Richard didn't want to wait that long: \" Can we meet in person today? \"419 On Friday the 13th, sales and marketing staff met with Richard to review how they would sell more opioids.420 382. In May, executives emphasized to the managers overseeing Massachusetts sales reps that the Sacklers were tracking their efforts , and that Richard Sackler required weekly reports .421 Staff gave the only reply that was acceptable at Purdue: \"All our efforts are focused on attaining the objective\" of increased opioid prescriptions that the Sacklers set.422 383.

In January 2013, in what was becoming a yearly ritual, Richard Sackler questioned staff about the drop in opioid prescriptions caused by Purdue sales reps taking time off for the holidays. Richard wasn't satisfied: \"Really don't understand why this happens. What about refills last week? Was our share up or down?\"439 Staff assured Richard that doctors were \"sensitive\" to sales rep visits and, as soon as the reps got back into action, they would \"boost\" opioid prescriptions again.440 393.

Staff also told the Sacklers that sales reps would place greater emphasis on the opioid savings cards, which the Sackler s knew and intended would keep patients on opioids longer. Staff reported to the Sackler s that Purdue had conducted a sensitivity analysis on the opioid savings cards to maximize their impact and, as a result, had increased the dollar value and set the program period to be 15 months long. Staff also reported to the Sackler s that Purdue ha d created promotional materials to support these tactics and had distributed them to the sales force.

In March , staff reported to the Sacklers on the devastation caused by prescription opioids . Staff told the Sacklers that drug overdose deaths had more than tripled since 1990 \u2014 the period during which Purdue had made OxyContin the best -selling painkiller. Staff told the Sacklers that tens of thousands of deaths were onl y the \"tip of the iceberg.\" Staff reported that, for every death, there were more than a hundred people suffering from prescription opioid dependence or abuse.447 397. In May , staff reported to the Sackler s again that they were successfully using opioid savings cards to get patients to \"remain on therapy longer.\" Staff told the Sackler s that they were using direct mail and email, as well as sales visits, to push the opioid savings cards.448 398. Staff reported to the Sackler s that, despite these sales efforts, they w ere not achieving the goals of getting enough patients on higher doses of opioids and getting doctors to prescribe more pills in each prescription. Staff told them that \"there is an 'unfavorable' mix of prescriptions across strengths,\" and Purdue was losi ng tens of millions of dollars in revenue because sales of the highest doses (60mg and 80mg) were too low. Staff told the Sackler s that there was also a second problem: \"lower average tablet counts per prescription.\" Because doctors were not prescribing enough pills during each patient visit, Purdue was losing tens of millions of dollars in revenue. Staff promised the Sackler s: \"A deeper analysis is underway to determine the cause of the decline in the 30mg, 60mg, and 80mg tablet strengths, as well as the lower than budgeted average tablets per prescription. Once the analysis is complete, we will have a better sense of w hat tactics to implement to address both issues.\"449 Board report, pg. 8, PPLP004367547. 135 399. The Sacklers met with Sales VP Russell Gasdia about the strategy for selling high doses. Gasdia told the Sacklers that \"Titration up to higher strengths, especially the 40mg and 80mg strengths is declining.\" He ana lyzed the \"Causes of OxyContin's Decline in Higher Strengths,\" and how Purdue would reverse that decline. He told the Sacklers that Purdue's #1 tactic to sell higher doses was sending sales reps to visit prescribers. The #2 tactic was a marketing campaig n designed to promote high doses \u2014 Purdue's Individualize The Dose campaign. After that, Gasdia told the Sacklers, came opioid savings cards. After that, special focus on the most prolific opioid prescribers.450 400. Gasdia told the Sacklers that the staff woul d develop even more tactics to sell higher doses . They were using Purdue's data on thousands of doctors and patients to learn what made people willing to use high doses of opioids. They had started a study of physician characteristics and a \"patient leve l analysis to determine what patient characteristics\" were associated with \"higher dose volume.\"451 401. That same month, s taff told the Sackler s that Purdue employed 637 sales reps and, during Q1 2013, they visited prescribers 155,354 times.452 More than 2,300 of those visits were in Massachusetts.453 402.

Staff explained to the Sackler s that insufficient volume of sales rep visits to promote OxyContin to prescribers was an important reason for the dropping sales. Staff told the Sackler s that they would increase the number of sales visits and had hired McKinsey to study how to get doctors to prescribe more OxyContin.455 403. Staff also reported to the Sackler s that key priorit ies w ere to reverse \"the decline in higher strengths\" of Purdue opioids, and the decline in \"tablets per Rx,\" which were reducing Purdue's profit. They told the Sackler s that Purdue staff were studying ways to fight these trends, and McKinsey would analyze the data down to the level of individual physicians.456 404.

Staff promised Richard that they would review the legislation and get back to him to discuss a strategy for opposing it.484 418. Staff reported to the Sackler s that a key initiative during Q3 2013 was for sale s reps to encourage doctors to prescribe OxyContin to elderly patients on Medicare.485 In Massachusetts during 2013, sales reps reported to Purdue that they pushed opioids for elderly patients more than a thousand times. The sales reps did not disclose to doctors in Massachusetts that elderly patients faced greater risks of drug interactions, injuries, falls, and suffocating to death. 419.

Staff also reported to the Sackler s that a key initiative in 2013 was to train sales reps to keep patients on Butrans opioids longer. They told the Sackler s that, at the same time as the initiative to keep patients on opioids longer, Purdue launched a new high dose of its Butrans opioid; sales reps began promoting the new high dose to physicians using new sales materials; and initial orders were double the company's forecasts. Staff reported to the Sackler s that marketing and sales activities generated 266,842 additional prescriptions and highlighted that opioid savings cards generat e especially \"high returns\" by keeping patients on opioids longer. 491 424.

Meanwhile, staff contacted Richard Sackler because they were concerned that the company's \"internal documents\" could cause problems i f investigations of the opioid crisis expanded.500 Early the next year, staff told Jonathan Sackler about the same concern. Jonathan studied collections of news reports and asked staff to assure him that journalists covering the opioid epidemic were not focused on the Sacklers.501 2014 430. In January 2014, staff reported to the Sacklers on how Purdue's program for complying with state and federal law compared to recent agreements between other drug companies and the government. Other companies had agreed that sales reps should not be paid bonuses based on i ncreasing doctors' prescriptions, but Purdue still paid reps for generating sales. Other companies disclosed to the public the money they spent to influence continuing medical education, but Purdue did not. Other companies had adopted \"claw -back\" policie s so that executives would forfeit bonuses they earned from misconduct; but Purdue had not. The Boards of other companies passed resolutions each quarter certifying their oversight of the companies' compliance with the law; but the Sacklers did not.502 499 2013- 12-04 email from David Rosen, 500 2014- 01-03 email from Burt Rosen, PPLPC020000748356 (\"I spoke to Richard just before the year end and raised concerns over our internal documents.\"). 501 2014- 01-02 email from Jonathan Sackler, PPLPC020000748356. 502 2014- 01-16 quarterly compliance report to the Board, PPLP004410797. 146 431. In February , staff sent the Sackler s the final results from 2013.503 Staff told the Sacklers that net sales were hundreds of millions of dollars below budget because doctors were not prescribing enough of the highest doses of opioids and were including too few pills with each prescription, and sales reps were not visiting doctors enough.504 Sales VP Russell Gasdia wrote privately to a friend: \" Our myopic focus on extended release opioids with abuse deterrent properties has not yielded the results people thought i t would in the market. It 's been hard to convince colleagues and the board that our success in this market is over .\"505 432. To get higher sales, staff told the Sacklers that they had tightened the requirements for sales reps' pay: from now on, sales reps would lose bonus pay if they did not visit \"high value\" prescribers often enough.506 In Massachusetts, Purdue identified as \"h igh value\" doctors like Conrad Benoit, Yoon Choi, Fernando Jayma, and Fathalla Mashali \u2014 and managers ordered reps to keep promoting drugs to them even after reps warned Purdue that the doctors were involved in diversion and abuse .507 433. A few days later, st aff told the Sacklers that Purdue's marketing had an immense effect in driving opioid prescriptions: according to Purdue's analysis, its sales and marketing tactics generated an additional 560,036 prescriptions of OxyContin in 2012 and 2013. Nevertheless, st aff reported to the Sackler s that net sales for 2013 had been $377,000,000 less than budgeted.

Staff reported to Sackler s again that sales reps were continuing the Individualize T he Dose campaign.509 As the Sackler s knew, Purdue designed that campaign to encourage higher doses.510 Staff also told the Sackler s that Purdue's eMarketing campaign for OxyContin reached 84,250 health care providers during Q4 2013. Staff told the Sackler s that they found increasing compliance concerns with Purdue's speaker programs, in which the company paid doctors to promote Purdue opioids to other doctors.511 435. As in the past, staff reported to the Sackler s again about developments in Massachusetts. Staff told them that Massachusetts had int roduced legislation concerning opioid prescriptions and Purdue staff were developing language to propose modifying the Massachusetts bill.512 436. Staff told the Sackler s that Purdue employed 632 sales reps and, during Q4 2013, they visited prescribers 176,227 ti mes.513 More than 2,900 of those visits were in Massachusetts.514 508 2014- 02-04 Board report, pg s. 3, 5, 22, PPLPC002000181037, -039, -043, 056 . 509 13-14, PPLPC002000181047- 048. 510 2013- 05-22 mid -year sales update, slides 4, 14, PPLPC012000424611, 21. See paragraph 670 below. 511 2014- 02-04 Board report pg s. 15, 39- 40, PPLPC002000181 -073-074. 512 2014- 02-04 Board report pg. 43, PPLPC002000181077. The report refers to legislation on \"interchangeable\" drugs that pharmacists dispense in some circumstances instead of the drug listed on a prescription. 513 2014- 02-04 Board report, pg s. 9, 47, PPLPC002000181043, -081. Staff told the Sacklers that the sales rep visits compared to a target for the quarter of 183,960 visits; and that reps hit the target of visiting 7.1 prescribers per day, because managers reduced the target for visiting pharmacies to allow more visits to prescribers. 514 Exhibit 1 . 148 437. That February report was the last of its kind. After Q4 2013, Purdue abolished the detailed Quarterly Reports that had created a paper trail of targets for sales visits and been emailed among the Board and staff. In 2013, the City of Chicago served Purdue with a subpoena seeking internal documents about Purdue's marketing of opioids. 515 .516 Purdue .517 For 2014, Purdue decided to limit many of its official Board reports to numbers and graphs, and relay other information orally. But the Sackler s continued to demand information about sales tactics, and their control of Purdue's deceptive marketing did not change. 438. In March and April , staff told the Sacklers that Purdue was achieving its goals of selling higher doses of OxyContin and more pills of OxyContin per prescription, but weekly prescriptions of Purdue's Butrans opioid were below expectations because of a reduced number of sales rep visits promoting that opioid.518 The Sacklers had assumed prescriptions would fall, but staff were concerned that the effect could be greater than anticipated.519 439. In May , Purdue's CEO reported to the Sacklers on Purdue's work to influence legislation to maximize Purdue's sales in Massachusetts. He reported \"a positive development in Massachusetts, a state from which we 've seen sig nificant anti -opioid activity in recent months. Yesterday, the Massachusetts Senate passed legislation that included a provision developed by 515 2015- 11-20 email from Robert Josephson, PPLP004153099; 2013- 04-24 email from Burt Rosen, Q1 summary of results , slide 7, PPLPC012000473131. Staff told the Sacklers that Purdue employed 643 sales reps. 2014 -04-14 headcount summary , PPLPC012000473138. 149 Purdue .\"520 Richard Sackler replied immediately to agree that the development in Massachusetts was good news.521 440. That same month, Richard and Jonathan's father, Raymond Sackler, sent David, Jonathan, and Richard Sackler a confidential memo about Purdue's strategy, including specifically putting patients on high doses of opioids for long periods of time. The memo recount ed that some physicians had argued that patients should not be given high doses of Purdue opioids, or kept on Purdue opioids for long periods of time, but Purdue had defeated efforts to impose a maximum dose limit or a maximum duration of use. Raymond ask ed David, Jonathan, and Richard to talk with him about the report.522 441. In June , the Sacklers removed Russell Gasdia as Vice President of S ales and Marketing , and began pushing his replacement to sell more opioids faster.523 Gasdia warned his replacement that Richard managed the sales operation intensely \u2014 \"there are times this becomes a tennis match with Dr. Richard.\"524 Sure enough, Richard told Gasdia's replacement that he would be given little time to show that he could increase opioid sales : \"it is very late in the day to rescue the failed launch\" of Butrans, which was not making as much money as Richard desired .525 CEO Mark Timney tried to caution Richard that i t was \"a little early\" to be attac king the new sales leader , since he'd been at P urdue only email from PPLPC019000926225 . bill use of OxyContin by prohibiting a non- abuse -deterrent formulation from being dispensed if an abuse -deterrent formulation is availabl e. 521 2014- Sackler, 05-05 email from Raymond Sackler, PWG000412141; 2014 -05-04 attached memo from Burt Rosen, PWG00041214 3. 523 2014- 06-10 email from Richard Sackler, PPLPC012000483 200. 524 email from Russell Gasdia, PPLPC012000483223. Mark Timney, PPLPC012000483235 442. That same month, staff sent the Sacklers an \" Update on L.A. Times mitigation effort \" about tactics to discourage scrutiny of Purdue's misconduct .527 Staff wrote to the Sacklers: As you may recall, one of our efforts to mitigate the im pact of a potential negative Los Angeles Times (LAT) story involved assisting a competing outlet in marginalizing the LAT's unbalanced coverage by reporting the facts before the LAT story ran. The following Orange County Register story, developed in close coordination with Purdue, achieved this goal. This fact - based narrative robs the LAT account of its newsworthiness and contradicts many of the claims we expected that paper to make.528 In 2012, the Los Angeles Times had studied coroner's records and revealed that overdose s killed thousands of patients who were taking opioids prescribed by their doctors, refuting the Sacklers' lie that patients who are prescribed opioids don't get addicted and die.529 The next year , the Los Angeles Times revealed that Purdue tracked illegal sales of OxyContin with a secret list of 1,800 doctors code -named Region Zero, but did not report them to the authorities.530 The \"mitigation effort\" that the Sacklers ordered was not designed to protect patients from o verdoses or from illegal prescribers, but instead to protect the Sacklers from reporters revealing the truth . 443. In July , Richard Sackler called staff to complain about studies that the FDA required for opioids and how they might undermine Purdue's sales. He emphasized that Purdue Board members felt the requirements to conduct studies were unfair. Staff tried to reassure 527 2014- 06-30 email from Raul Damas, PPLPC022000741863. A few weeks after receiving the mitigation update, Richard Sackler demanded that the L.A. Times send him all the paper's correspondence with Purdue. 2014 -08-14 email from Scott Glover, PPLPC024000872837. 528 2014- 06-30 email from Raul Damas, PPLPC022000741863.

In July and again in August , September , and October, staff warned the Sacklers that two of the greatest risks to Purdue's business were \"Continued pressure against higher doses of opioids ,\" and \" Continued pressure against long term use of opioids .\"532 Staff r eport to the Board on risks facing P urdue's business Staff told the Sacklers that Purdue's #1 opportunity to resist that pressure was by sending sales reps to visit prescribers ; and, specifically , by target ing the most susceptible doctors, who could be convinced to be prolific prescribers, and visiting them many times.533 531 Flash Report, slide 5, PPLPC016000244173 ; 2014- 08-05 Board Flash Report, slide 6, PPLPC016000250753; 2014 -09-05 Board Flash Report, slide 6, PPLPC016000254916; 2014- Board Flash Report, slide 7, PPLPC016000259607. 533 Board Flash Report, slide 5, PPLPC016000244173 ; 2014- 08-05 Board Flash Report, slide 6, PPLPC016000250753 ; 2014 -09-05 Board Flash Report, slide 6, PPLPC016000254916 . 152 Project 445.

In October 2014, staff sent the Sackler s a Proposed Operating Plan and Budget to be approved by the Board for 2015.542 Staff told the Sackler s that a key tactic for 2015 would be to convert patients from short -acting opioids to OxyContin. Staff warned the Sackler s that prescribers were shifting away from the highest doses of Purdue's opioids, and toward fewer pills per prescription, and those shifts would cost Purdue $99,000,000 a year. Staff told the Sackler s that a key tactic to increase Butrans sales in 2015 would be for Purdue sales reps to push doctors to \"titrate up\" to higher doses . Staff likewise told the Sackler s that visits to doctors by sales reps would be a key tactic to launch Purdu e's new Hysingla opioid: the company would: \"Leverage Purdue's existing, experienced sales force to dr ive uptake with target HCPs\" and \"Add additional contract sales force capacity at launch to drive uptake.\"543 Staff proposed that Purdue employ 519 sales reps, paid an average salary of $81,300 plus a bonus of up to an additional $124,600 based on sales.544 453. Meanwhile, sales staff exchanged news reports of a lawsuit accusing Purdue of deceptive marketing in Kentucky.545 They quoted Purdue's own attorney and Chief Financial Officer stating that the company faced claims of more than a billion dollars that \"would have a crippling effect on Purdue's operations and jeopardize Purdue's long- term viability.\"546 Purdue's communications staff were delighted by the article, because it did not reveal the Sacklers ' role in the misconduct. \" I'm quite pleased with where we en ded up.

Damas, 157 454. In November, staff reported to the Sacklers that their sales tactics were working, and the shift away from higher doses of OxyContin had slowed.548 Staff also told the Sacklers that Purdue had helped to pass a law that would encourage OxyContin sales in Massachusetts.549 455. In December, staff told the Sackler s .550 456. On New Year's Eve, Richard Sackler told staff that he was starting a confidential sales and marketing project on opioid prices and instructed them to meet with him about it on January 2.551 2015 457. Early in the morning of January 2, staff began scrambling to collect sales data for Richard Sackler.552 They didn't move quickly enough. Days later, Richard demanded a meeting with sales staff to go over plans for selling the highest doses. Richard asked for an exhaustive examination to be completed within 5 days, including: \"unit projections by strength, mg by strength ... pricing expectations by strength ... individual strength's market totals and our share going backward to 2011 or 12 and then forward to 2019 or 2020 ... the same information for Hysingla ...

That same month, the Sacklers . . The Sacklers .556 459. In April , staff told the Sackler s that sales of Purdue's highest dose 80mg OxyContin were down 20% and that the average prescription had declined by eight pills since 2011. 460. The Sackler s .557 As with every reference to \"the Sacklers\" after July 2012, that includes Beverly, David, Ilene, Jonathan, Kathe, Mortimer, Richard, and Theresa Sackler. 461.

The Sacklers knew and intended that, because of their vote, more sales reps would promote opioids to prescribers in Massachusetts. From 2015 to the present , reps hired in the 2015 expansion promoted Purdue opioids to Massachusetts prescribers more than 4,000 times .559 Massachusetts Communities Targeted in Purdue's 2015 Sales Force Expansion 463. In October, Purdue executives identified avoiding investigations of Purdue's opioid marketing as a \"Key Activity\" in the Middleborough, Needham, ew Bedford, Newton, Norfolk, Norton, Norwell, Norwood, Oak Bluffs, Orleans, Osterville, Peabody, Pembroke, Woburn, Worcester, and Yarmouth. 560 2015- 10-27 Executive Operating Committee presentation, slide 16, PPLPC011000065538. 160 464. In November, the Sackler s voted on the budget for Purdue for 2016.561 Staff warned the Sackler s that public concern about opioids could get in the way of Purdue's plans and told them that Massachusetts, specifically, was one of two states considering legislation that worrie d Purdue. Staff again told the Sackler s that two of the most significant challenges to Purdue's plans were doctors not prescribing enough of the highest strength opioids and including too few pills in each prescription. Staff told the Sackler s that decli ning prescriptions of the highest doses and fewer pills per prescription would cost Purdue $77,000,000.562 465. Staff proposed to the Sackler s that, for 2016, Purdue would plan for prescribers to average 60 pills of Purdue opioids per prescription. They told the Sackler s that they would aim to make enough of those pills be high doses to make the average per pill 33 milligrams of oxycodone .563 That way, Purdue could hit its target for the total kilograms of oxycodone it wanted to sell. 466. To make sure Purdue hit the targets, staff told the Sackler s that sales reps were visiting prescribers 21% more often than before. Staff told the Sackler s that they had aggressively reviewed and terminated reps who failed to generate prescriptions. Staff reported to the Sackler s that, in 2015 alone, Purdue replaced 14% of its sales reps and 20% of its District Managers for failing to create enough opioid sales .564 467. Looking ahead, staff told the Sackler s that \"the 2016 investment strategy focuses on expanding the Sales Force.\" They reported that the proposed budget for sales and promotion was $11,600,000 higher than 2015, \"primarily due to the Sales Force expansion.\" The top priority for the sales reps would be to visit the highest -prescribing doctors again and again.

Purdue fired 107 sales reps in 2015. 161 proposed to the Sackler s that the #1 overall priority for 2016 would be to sell OxyContin through \"disproportionate focus on key customers.\" They told the Sackler s that sales reps would also target prescribers with the lowest levels of training, physician's assistants and nurse practitioners, because they were \"the only growing segment\" in the opioid market.565 Purdue executives expected that, each quarter, the sales reps would visit prescribers more than 200,000 times and would get 40,000 new patients onto Purdue opioids.566 468. In December, s taff prepared to address wide- ranging concerns raised by the Sacklers. Kathe and Mortimer Sackler wanted staff to break out productivity data by indication versus prescriber specialty for each drug. Richard Sackler sought details on how staff was calculating 2016 mg/tablet trends. Jonathan Sackler sought a follow -up briefing on how public health efforts to prevent opioid addiction would affect OxyContin sales.567 469. Before the year ended, the Sacklers were invited to a \"Beneficiaries Meeting\" where Purdue staff reported to Sackler family members about the company's efforts to sell opioids .568 565 2015- 11 budget for 2016, slide 26, 49, PPLPC011000069975, -69977, -70000. 566 2015- 11-03 email from Zach Perlman, Executive Committee materials, slide 36, PPLPC011000065030. 567 2015- 12-09 email from Zach Perlman, PPLPC011000073228 Committee presentation, slides 12-13, PPLPC011000073230. 568 2015- 10-28 email from Stuart Baker, PPLPC011000063897 ; see also November 2013 Beneficiaries Meeting, PPLP004410528. 162 2016 470. In 2016, the Sackler s met with the Board in Janua ry, March, April, June, August, October, November, and December .569 471. In April , the Sackler s considered exactly how much money was riding on their strategy of pushing higher doses of opioids. The month before, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control announced guidelines to try to slow the epidemic of opioid overdose and death. The CDC urged prescr ibers to avoid doses higher than 30mg of Purdue's OxyContin twice per day. The CDC discouraged twice -a-day prescriptions of all three of Purdue's most profitable strengths \u2014 40mg, 60mg, and 80mg. Staff studied how much money Purdue was making from its hi gh dose strategy and told the Sacklers that $23,964,122 was at risk in Massachusetts each year.570 472. In May , Richard Sackler told staff to circulate a New York Times story reporting that opioid prescriptions were dropping for the first time since Purdue launched OxyContin twenty years earlier . The Times wrote: \"Experts say the drop is an important early signal that the long- running prescription opioid epidemic may be peaking, that doctors have begun heeding a drumbeat of warnings about the highly addictive nature of the drugs.\" The only person quoted in favor of more opioid prescribing was a Massachusetts professor whose program at Tufts University was funded by the S acklers.571 569 2016- 05-19 Executive Committee pre -read, . 570 2016- 04-13 Commerci al Update, slide PPLPC016000286167. email from Richard Sackler, PPLPC021000841074 ; 2016- 05-20 \"Opioid Prescriptions Drop for First Time Two by Abby Goodnough and Sabrina Tavernise .

That same month, s taff presented the 2016 Mid-Year Update. They warned the Sackler s that shifts in the national discussion of opioids threatened their plans. The deception that Purdue had used to conceal the risks of opioids was being exposed. Staff summarized the problems on a slide:573 2016 Mid-Year Board Update 475. First , to convince doctors to prescribe dangerous opioids, Purdue promoted its drugs as the solution to \"undertreatment of pain.\" Richard Sackler made sure that Purdue bought the internet address 5thvitalsign.com so it could promote pain as the \"fifth vital sign\" (along with 572 2016- 05-27 email from Stuart Baker, PPLPC011000099222; 2016- 06 Board ).\" 573 lide 18, PPLPC011000099783 . \"ADF\" on the slide refers to abuse -deterrent formulations of opioids, such as Purdue's crush -resistant OxyContin, which do not prevent addiction. 165 temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and breathing rate) to expand the market for opioids.574 But now, staff reported to the Sacklers, doctors and patients were starting to worry more about the epidemic of opioid addiction and death.575 476. Second, t o conceal the danger of addiction, Purdue falsely blamed the terrible consequences of opioids on drug abuse. One of Purdue's key messages argued : \"It's not addiction, it's abuse .\"576 But now, staff reported to the Sacklers, doctors and patients were realizing that addiction was a true danger .577 477. Third , to avoid responsibility for Purdue's dangerous drugs , the Sacklers chose to stigmatize people who were hurt by opioids , calling them \"junkies \" and \"criminals.\" Richard Sackler wrote that Purdue should \"hammer\" them in every way possible.578 But now, staff reported to the Sacklers, Americans were seeing through the stigma and recognizing that millions of families we re victims of addictive drugs. Staff told the Sacklers that nearly half of Americans reported that they knew someone who had been addicted to prescription opioids.579 478. Fourth, the Sacklers had long sought to hide behind the approval of Purdue's drugs by the FDA. But FDA approval could not protect the Sacklers when their deceptive marketing led thousands of patients to become addicted and die. The U.S. Centers for Disease Contr ol (\"CDC\") r eported that opioids were, indeed, killing people. The CDC Director said: \"We know of no other medication that's routinely used for a nonfatal condition that kills patients 574 1999- 06-14 email from Richard Sackler, PDD1706189908 . -Year Update, s lide 05-16 email from Pamela 2008- notes, PPLPC012000183256; 2008 -04-16 presentation Maslansky Strategic Research, slide 28, PPLPC012000183259. 577 2016- 06-08 -Year Update, s lide 18, 578 2001- 02-01 email from Richard Sackler, PDD8801133516 (\"we have to hammer on the abusers in every way possible.

Staff also told the Sackler s that Massachusetts was one of four states to pass laws limiting opioid prescriptions .581 In the face of this pressure, staff told the Sackler s that the sales team was focus ing on the doctors who prescribe the most opioids.582 480. In November, staff prepared statements to the press denying the Sacklers' involvement in Purdue. Their draft claimed: \"Sackler family members hold no leadership roles in the companies owned by the family trust.\"583 That was a lie. Sackler family members held the controlling majority of seats on the Board and, in fact, controlled the company. A staff member reviewing the draft knew what was up and commented with apparent sarcasm: \"Love the ... statement.\"584 Staff eventually told the press: \" Sackler family members hold no management positions.\"585 481. Some employees worried about the deception. When journalists asked follow-up questions about the Sacklers, communications staff deliberated about whether to repeat the \"no management positions\" claim. They double-checked that Purdue's top lawyers had ordered the statement . Then they arranged for one of the Sacklers' foreign compani es to issue it , so U.S. employees would not be blamed: \"The statement will come out of Singapore.\" 586 482. In December, Richard, Jonathan and Mortimer Sackler . 580 2016- 03-15 briefing by CDC Director Tom Mid PPLPC011000099783 .

In May 2017, staff told the Sacklers that an independent nonprofit had concluded that Purdue's reformulation of OxyContin was not a cost-effective way to prevent opioid abuse.590 Theresa Sackler asked staff what they were doing to fight back to convince doctors and patients to keep using the drug.591 485.

In June , staff told the Sacklers that getting doctors to prescribe high doses of opioids and many pills per prescription were still key \"drivers\" of Purdue's profit. Purdue's management was concerned that the CDC's efforts to save lives by reducing doses and pill counts would force the company \"to adjust down our revenue expectations.\"593 487. Staff told the Sackler s that Purdue's opioid sales were being hurt by cultural trends such as the HBO documentary, \" Warning: This Drug May Kill You.\"594 HBO's film was a problem for Purdue because it showed actual footage from Purdue's misleading advertisements next to video of people who overdosed and died.595 488. Staff felt the pressure of the opioid epidemic, even if the billionaire Sacklers did not. In one presentation, staff came close to insubordination and told the Sacklers: \"Purdue Needs a New Approach.\" The ir suggestion for Use.\" 593 2017- 06 Board of Directors: Purdue Mid -Year Read, slide s 2, 152, PPLPC011000151189. 594 2017- 06 Board of Directors: Purdue Mid Read, slide 6, PPLPC011000151189. 595 2017- 05-01 \"Warning: This Drug May Kill You Offers a Close -Up of the Opioid Epidemic,\" https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/05/warning -this-drug-may-kill-you-opioid- epidemic - hbo/524982/. 169 The Sackler s led Purdue so far into the darkness that employees proposed \"appropriate use\" of drugs to reinvent the company. Staff also suggested that the Sacklers create a family foundation to help solve the opioid crisis.596 489. The Sacklers did not redirect the company toward appropriate use or create the suggested family foundation. Instead, they decided to sell harder. For 2018, the Sacklers approved a target for sales reps to visit prescribers 1 ,050,000 times \u2014 almost double the number of sales visits they had ordered during the heyday of OxyContin in 2010.597 490.

In November, Jonathan Sackler sug gested that Purdue launch yet another opioid.602 Staff promised to present a plan for additional opioids at the next meeting of the Board.603 At the Board meeting that month, the remaining Sackler Board members (Richard, David, Ilene, Jonathan, Kathe, Mortim er, and Theresa) voted to cut the sales force from 582 reps to 302 reps. They knew sales reps would continue to promote opioids in Massachusetts .

In January 2018, Richard Sackler received a patent for a drug to treat opioid addiction \u2014 . Richard had applied for the patent in 2007. He assigned it to a different company controlled by the Sackler family, instead of Purdue. Richard 's patent application says opioids are addictive. The application calls the people who become addicted to opioids \"junkies\" and asks for a monopoly on a method of treating addiction.605 494. In January, Richard Sackler also met with Purdue staff about the sales force again . They discussed plans to cut the force to 275 reps. In February, Richard, David, Ilene, Jonathan, Kathe, Mortimer, and Theresa Sackler .606 495. By April , staff were scared. Richard Sackler was again asking questions about sales. Staff prepared a presentation for the Board of Directors (\"BoD\"). One employee suggested that they add more information about the company's problems. Another cautioned against that: \"I think we need to find a balance between being clear about what reality looks like - which I certainly support in [this] situation - and just giving so much bad news about the future that it just makes things look hopeless.

On June 12, 2018, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed this suit to hold the Sacklers as well as Purdue accountable. Just as their emplo yees predicted, the Sacklers tried to run. Richard Sackler was the first to go: he resigned from the Board in July. David Sackler quit in August. Theresa Sackler served her last day in September.

Starting in 2008, the Sacklers asked five additional defendants to join them on the Board: Peter Boer was a Director from April 2008 to the present; Judith Lewent was a Director from March 2009 to December 2013; Cecil Pickett was a Director from January 2010 to the present; Paulo Costa was a Director from April 2012 to January 2018; and Ralph Snyderman was a Director from August 2012 to October 2017. 500. These defendants did not act independently from the Sacklers. Together with the Sacklers, they controlled the unfair and deceptive sales and marketing tactics Purdue used to sell its opioids in Massachusetts. 501.

Throughout their Board tenur es, Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman learned all these things and engaged with staff on many of them. They participated in many of the same meetings as the Sacklers. They provided their votes for many of the same decisions as the Sacklers, and always voted in lock- step when they did. And they continued to direct sales and marketing conduct aimed at increasing opioid prescribing and sales, despite knowing that that conduct was contributing to the epidemic of addiction, overdose and death. In a ll this misconduct, these five defendants shared responsibility with the Sacklers, including as detailed below. 617 2008- 07-15 Board report, pg. 28, PPLP004367324. 618 2010 -07-22 Response to Questions from Board Meeting, PPLPC012000283169; 2011- 02-03 presentation by Bert Weinstein, slides 94 2009- 620 2009- 07-30 Board report, pg. 15, PPLPC012000233246. To avoid being excluded from U.S. healthcare programs, Purdue agreed that its District Managers would observe and supervise each sales rep for five days each year.

In the second year of the agreement, staff reported to the Board that they failed to provide five days' of supervision for 23 sales reps. 176 2007 - 2008 514. Peter Boer was no stranger to Purdue or the Sacklers when he joined Purdue's Board. He had been serving on the board of the Sacklers' Rhode Island-based opioid manufacturing company, Rhodes Technologies, directing Purdue's oxycodone pipeline there for a decade, and he had been overseeing the supply of drug ingredients to Purdue as a director of the Sackler's U.K. -based pharmaceuticals company, Bard Pharmaceuticals, since 2002. 621 515.

In July, staff told Boer, as well as the Sacklers, that Purdue received 890 Reports of Concern regarding abuse and diversion of Purdue's opioids in the second quarter of 2008, and 621 2003- 07-18 memorandum by Peter Boer, notes, #273916.1 Richard Sackler, PDD9316102848 . 623 2008- 04-12 memorandum by Peter Boer to Richard Sackler, PDD9316314309; 2008- 03-28 emails from Richard Sackler and Peter Boer, PDD9316304944 . 624 2008- 04-12 memorandum to Boer , PDD9316314309. 625 2008- 04-18 email from 626 2008- 06-27 Board minutes, PKY183212646. 177 they had conducted only 25 field inquiries in response. This was one of sco res of reports that Boer would receive, along with the Sacklers, over the next decade. Staff reported to Boer that they received 93 tips to Purdue's compliance hotline during the quarter, but did not report any of them to the authorities.627 519. Staff also told Boer that they promoted Purdue opioids in Massachusetts in two presentations: an April presentation at Tufts University concerning use of opioids to manage chronic pain and a June presentation at the Tufts Health Care Institute concerning use of urine screens in pain management.628 Convincing Massachusetts doctors that opioids were the best way to manage chronic pain and that urine tests protected patients from addiction were both part of Purdue's unfair and deceptive scheme. 520. In October, staff told Boer tha t surveillance data monitored by Purdue indicated a \"wide geographic dispersion\" of abuse and diversion of OxyContin \"throughout the United States.\" Staff told Boer that \"availability of the product\" and \"prescribing practices\" were key factors driving abuse and diversion of OxyContin.\" On the same day, staff told Boer that Purdue had begun a new \"Toppers Club sales contest\" for sales reps to win bonuses, based on how much a rep increased OxyContin use in her territory and how much the rep increased the b roader prescribing of opioids \u2014 the same \"availability of product\" and \"prescribing practices\" factors that worsen the risk of diversion and abuse. In the same report, staff told Boer that they received 163 tips to Purdue's compliance hotline during the third quarter of 2008, but did not report any of them to the authorities.629 627 2008- 07-15 Board report, pg s. 21, 28, 07-15 Board report, pg. 21, PPLP004367317. 629 2008- 10-15 316101020 , -025, -029. 178 521. Staff also told Boer that Purdue now employed 414 sales reps. The Board's . During the third quarter of 2008, the number of sales visits to Massachusetts prescribers increased by 20% to more than 1,800.630 2009 522. Defendant Judith Lewent joined the Board in March 2009.631 523. In April, staff told Boer and Lewent that Purdue employed 412 sales reps and had made dramatic progress toward their goal of promoting higher doses: \"for the first time since January 2008, OxyContin 80mg strength tablets exceeded the 40mg strength tablets during December 2008.\" 632 524. Staff also told Boer and Lewent that they received 122 tips to Purdue's compliance hotline during the first quarter of 2009, and revealed one of them to an outside monitor. Staff told Boer and Lewent that the compliance problems included improper use of OxyContin promotional materials and opioid savings cards.633 525. In June, staff reported to Boer and Lewent that Purdue had expanded its opioid sales force at their direction: \"As approved in the 2009 Budget, 50 New Sales Territories have been created.\" Staff told them that the expansion was focused on visiting doctors who prescribe the most, because \"there are a significant number of the top prescribers\" that Purdue had not been able to visit with its smaller force of sales reps.\" 634 630 2008- 10-15 Board report, pg. 26, PDD9316101027; Exhibit 1 (20% increase from Q3 2007). 631 Judy Lewent declaration. 632 2009- 04-16 Board report, pg s. 5, 28, PDD93161006 01, 2009- email PPLPC012000226604; 2009- 05-20 Executive Committee notes, PPLPC012000226606. 179 526.

In February, Purdue's Sales and Marketing Department reported to Boer, Lewent, and Pickett that a key objective for 2010 was meeting a prescriber sales call quota of 545,000. Sales call quotas remained a priority over the next four years, and the Board tracked the sales force's performance on at least a quarterly basis as the quota rose from 545,000 prescriber visits in 2010, to 712,000 visits in 2011, 752,417 visits in 2012, and 744,777 visits in 2013.638 Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman all received regular updates on these quotas throughout their terms on the Board. 530. Boer, Lewent, and Pickett also received regular updates on Purdue's efforts to intensify its OxyContin promotion. In April, staff reported to Boer, Lewent, and Pickett that 635 Taylor, pg. 3, PDD8901041368 ; 2010- 02-09 email from Pamela Taylor, Executive Com mittee notes, PPLPC012000257446; 04-21 Board report, pg. 3, PWG000423141; 2011 - 05-02 Board report, pg. 3, PPLPC012000322428; 2012- 04-30 Board report, pg. 3, PPLPC012000374793; 2013- 05- 13 Board report, pg. 7, PPLP004367546. 180 they were working in 2010 to increase t he average number of daily prescriber visits from the previous year's 6.9 and to decrease the cost- per-visit from $219.639 531. In July, Boer, Lewent, and Pickett joined the Sacklers and sales and marketing staff for a Board meeting in Bermuda. Staff presented p lans for selling Purdue's new Butrans opioid and reported that sales reps would try to switch patients to Purdue opioids from NSAIDs like ibuprofen. Staff told Boer, Lewent, and Pickett that they had identified 82,092 prescribers to target with the Butran s sales campaign. Staff reported that they planned to add 125 sales reps and increase the number of prescriber visits from 574,000 to 750,000 per year.640 532. The Board . They .641 . 533. The Board .

The Board .644 Staff .645 536. For example, staff reported to the Board \u2014 including Boer, Lewent, and Pickett \u2014 that Purdue suspected Dr. Michael Taylor, in New Bedford, Massachusetts, was prescribing opioids inappropriately. In response to the Board's request, staff reported that, in the past two years, Taylor had prescribed OxyContin more than five hundred times, and provided Purdue with $392,505. 646 537. Likewise, in response to the Board's request, staff reported to Boer, Lewent, and Pickett and the other directors that Purdue suspected Dr. Alvin Chua, in Brookfield, Massachusetts, was prescribing opioids inappropriately. Staff told them that, in the past two years, Chua had prescribed OxyContin more than a thousand times, and provided Purdue with 643 2010-07-22 questions during Board meeting, PPLPC012000283167. 644 2010- during Board meeting, 538. A year after Purdue staff told the Board about Alvin Chua, the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine took away his license for improper opioid prescribing. Three years after Purdue told the Board about Michael Taylor, he lost his license and was convicted in Massachusetts court of prescribing opioids without a legitimate medical purpose. By then, Purdue and the Sacklers had collected hundreds of thousands of dollars from their dangerous prescriptions. Far worse \u2014 four Massachusett s patients, who were prescribed Purdue opioids by Taylor and Chua, overdosed and died. 539. The Board \u2014 including Boer, Lewent, and Pickett \u2014 . 540. At that same Board meeting . 648 Boer, Lewent, and Pickett knew and intended that the expanded sales force was promoting opioids in Massachusetts. In fact, Purdue sales reps visited Massachusetts prescribers more than 2,700 times during the last quarter of 2009 alone. 649 541. Purdue's aggressive sales strategy to target high prescribers worked. Purdue's top-paid physician consultant in Massachusetts at the time, Walter Jacobs, had a patient on twenty -four pills of 80mg OxyContin per day. In 2010, 72% of the OxyContin pills that Jacobs prescribed were the highest -dose 80mg pills. 542. In October, s taff reported to Boer, Lewent, and Pickett that Purdue 648 2010 -07-22 Board minutes, PKY183212838. 649 Exhibit 1. 183 promote opioids at more than a dozen speaking events in Massachusetts, including an $85,000 program on opioids at Tufts University and a $50,000 program on opioid prescribing for chronic pain at Boston University.650 543. In November, staff cautioned Boer, Lewent, and Picket t that drug company \"owners, officers, and managers will especially face even more serious scrutiny in the future.\"651 2011 544. In February 2011, staff informed Boer, Lewent, and Pickett that Purdue was using individual zip codes to track the correlation between poison control calls for OxyContin poisoning, pharmacy thefts, and Region Zero prescribers; gave Boer, Lewent, and Pickett a map of dangerous prescribers in Massachusetts; and briefed Boer, Lewent, and Pickett on a study showing that the financial penalties imposed on drug companies for illegal marketing were \"relatively small\" when \"compared to the perpetrating companies' profits.\"652 545. At the same meeting, staff gave the Board data showing that 83% of patients admitted to substance abuse treatment centers began abusing opioids by swallowing pills, and that it commonly takes 20 months for patients to get treatment.653 546. Later in February, staff told Boer, Lewent, and Pickett that Massachusetts lawmakers had introduced legislation to ban extended- release oxycodone, including Purdue's OxyContin.654 547. In early 2011, Purdue launched Butrans. Over the next few years, Boer, Lewent, 650 2010- 10-07 report attached to email by William Ma llin, pgs. 3, 5, 10, 13, 16, 26, 28, by Bert Weinstein, slide 7, PPLPC012000299866. 652 2011- 02-03 Board of Directors Meeting 95 , PDD8901468062, -108-109. 653 2011- 02-03 Board pg. 86, PDD8901468100. 654 2011- 02-23 email from Pamela Taylor, PPLPC012000312664; 2011- 01-26 Executive Committee notes, PPLPC012000312667- 668. 184 and Pickett, and later, Costa and Snyderman too, received weekly reports on sales metrics and tactics for Butrans. As it did to promote OxyContin, Purdue identified and targeted for more frequent promotion a \"super core\" of physicians who prescribed the most opioids.655 548. Staff went on to detail how, after identifying their \"super core\" of target prescribers, sales reps were instructed to \"improve specific patient focus and effective positioning of Butrans for specific patient types.\"656 In Massachusetts, promotion for \"specific patient types\" translated in many cases to pushing opioids for elderly patients with ailments such as arthritis. Purdue sales reps recorded in their notes that they pitched prescribing opioids to elderly patients to Massachusetts providers more than a thousand times in 2011.657 549. Boer, Lewent, and Pic kett were also briefed on Purdue's tactics for \"closing\" a sale \u2014 getting prescribers to commit to putting specific patients on opioids.658 This strategy was common to Purdue's opioid sales pitches, and Massachusetts prescribers reported to the Attorney Gen eral that Purdue sales reps had asked them on multiple occasions to commit to prescribing Purdue opioids without disclosing significant risks. 2012 550. Defendant Paulo Costa joined the Board in April 2012.659 551. Soon after joining the Board, Costa began discussing Purdue's sales and 655 2011- 05-25 email from Russell 2011- 05-25 email from Russell Gasdia, PPLPC012000326017. 659 Paulo Costa declaration for September 2018 motion to dismiss. 185 marketing strategy with staff, including Sales VP Russell Gasdia, and questioned whether, despite its aggressive expansion, Purdue was still underfunding its OxyContin promotion.660 Staff sent Costa an advance copy of the mid-year sales and marketing report, which included research showing that higher dosages and savings cards are factors contributing to longer duration of opioid use.661 552. For five days in June, Boer, Lewent, Pickett, and Costa attended the mid -year meeting of the Board.662 Sales staff told them that Purdue had added 120,000 sales visits devoted to the promotion of OxyContin. To further drive OxyContin sales, staff reported that they expanded the opioids savings cards and eMarketing programs and promoted opioids on the Professional Television Network. 663 553. In August, Defendant Ralph Snyderman joined the Board.664 554. That month, Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman .665 555. By the fall of 2012, Costa proposed a plan to Purdue staff to target patients on Medicaid as a strategy to revive declining OxyContin sales . Sales staff held a series of meetings to consider Costa's idea. Costa met with John Stewart and Russell Gasdia to discuss threats and opportunities in the opioid market.666 556. In November, staff provided Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman 660 2012- 06-04 email from from Mike Innaurato, PPLPC012000382120; 2012- . 662 663 2012- 06-18 Mid Year Sales and Marketing Board Update, slide 10, PPLPC012000382119. 664 Snyderman declaration. 665 2012- 08-16 Board minutes, PKY183212960. 2012- 11-03 email from Paulo Costa, PPLPC012000396834; 2012 -10-29 email from Paulo Costa, PPLPC012000396447; 2012 -10-30 email from Russell Gasdia, PPLPC012000396469. 186 .\" The . . Staff told Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman, together with the Sacklers, .667 2013 557. At the start of 2013, at the request of Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman, staff provided the Board with examples of political and third-party support for Purdue's \"abuse deterrent\" formulations, including in their report five Massachusetts legislators who had written favorable letters to the FDA.668 The Board directed staff to obtain such letters , despite knowing that there was no actual evidence that Purdue's reformulated OxyContin helped prevent opioid abuse and that, to the contrary, it did nothing to prevent the most common method of opioid abuse, by oral ingestion. 558. In January, the decline in high-dose opioid prescribing remained a preoccupation for Purdue's sales and marketing staff. Staff updated Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman on Purdue's Individualize The Dose campaign to promote higher doses. Staff also responded to Costa's recommendation to target managed care 667 2012- 11-01 Board report, pgs. 18, 30, PPLPC012000396634, - 646. 668 2013- 01-15 email from Burt Rosen, PPLPC032000255061; 2013 -01-15 attachment to email by Burt Rosen, PPLPC032000255064. 187 organizations, including Medicare Part D. Staff also reported that Purdue had increased the dollar value of opioid savings cards a nd set the program period to be 15 months long, in response to research showing the cards kept patients on opioids longer. Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman also learned that Purdue was pushing the opioid savings cards through mass -mailings and emails.669 559. Sales reps reported to Purdue that , during 2013, they promoted opioid savings cards to Massachusetts doctors more than a thousand times. The sales reps did not tell doctors that savings cards led patients to stay on opioids longer, or that staying on opioids longer increased the risk of addiction and death. 560. In February, staff informed Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman of the ever-growing public concern about the dangers of opioids. A presentation on the opioid marketing environment note d an \"increase in media reports questioning the use, and safety, of opioids for non- cancer pain.\" Staff told Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman about \"family members of overdose victims featured in these stories\" who have \"testified in support of restricting the use of opioids.\" Staff also warned the Board members about the rise of state task forces, pill mill legislation, and state -level initiatives to limit opioid prescribing and increase the utilization of prescription monitoring programs. Th e presentation characterized the growing public concern over opioid safety and the opioid crisis as due to a \"lack of interest by reporters to provide balanced reporting\" and promised that Purdue would push back.670 561. In March, staff reported to Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman on the devastation caused by prescription opioids. Staff told Boer, Lewent, P ickett, Costa, and Snyderman that drug overdose deaths had more than tripled since 1990 \u2014 the period during 669 2013- 01-28 Board report, pgs. 13- 14, PPLPC012000407139- 140. 670 2013- 02-13 business condition report to Board, slide s 38-40, PPLPC012000408089 -091. 188 which Purdue had made OxyContin the best-selling painkiller\u2014and that tens of thousands of deaths were only the \"tip of the iceberg.\" Staff reported that, for every death, there were more than a hundred people suffering from prescription opioid dependence or abuse.671 562. Although the Individualize The Dose tactics discussed in January were proving effective, staff stressed to Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman in May that Purdue needed to get even more patients on higher doses and larger prescriptions of opioids to meet its sales goals. Staff told Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman that Purdue was still $16,800,000 below budget due to ins ufficient sales of the highest doses of OxyContin and that prescribers writing \"lower average tablet counts per prescription\" was exacerbating this issue. 672 563. Staff told Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman that they were undertaking \"[a] deeper anal ysis...to determine the cause of the decline in the 30mg, 60mg, and 80mg tablet strengths, as well as the lower than budgeted average tablets per prescription. Once the analysis is complete, we will have a better sense of that tactics to implement to address both issues.\"673 564. Both \"the decline in higher strengths\" of Purdue opioids, and the decline in \"tablets per Rx,\" remained topics of Board discussion throughout 2013.674 To address it, staff informed Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman that Purdue continued adding more prescriber visits 671 2013- 03-21 Abuse Deterrent Strategy Presentation to the Board, slides 38- 39, PPLP004409513-5 14. 672 2013- 05-13 Board report, pg. pg. report, pg. 25, 565. Staff updated Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman on Purdue's successful lobbying against state legislation to impose safety restrictions on OxyContin, including a defeated bill in Massachusetts. Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman also learned that Purdue had begun email promotion of opioid savings cards s pecifically in Massachusetts. 676 566. In 2013, Purdue also increased its targeting of managed care organizations and insurance companies, including Medicaid and Medicare plans. In June and July, Paulo Costa strategized with Purdue staff, including Sales VP Russell Gasdia, to market Purdue opioids directly to insurance companies and managed care formularies. Under the plan, Purdue would try to convince them to cover opioids with data that the FDA had never approved. And Costa recommended Purdue's CEO promote opioids directly to the insurance company CEOs. 677 Over the coming months, acting on Costa's recommendations, Purdue continued to refine its approach to marketing to managed care patients.678 567.

Stewart identified Costa to sales staff as \"a champion for our moving forward with a comprehensive 'turbocharge' process ,\" .684 Purdue continued to follow-up on Costa's recommendations in the following months, as Purdue rebranded the Turbocharge campaign internally to Evolve to Excellence (or E2E).685 572. In September and October, Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman met with the Sacklers . .686 573. In October, staff informed Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, Snyderman, and the Sacklers of a correlation between \"DEA pressures\" and the \"declining trend[s]\" in sales of both extended release opioids and higher dose opioid pills. 687 Staff promised to include DEA enforcement and \"increasingly restrictive opioid prescribing guidelines and regulations\" in shaping their ongoing strategy to increase opioid sales, as well as to more than double the portion of the sales budget spent on promoting OxyContin through the E2E initiative. 688 574. Staff continued to update Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman on the new sales force tactics as they ramped up their implementation through the final quarter of 2013, 683 2013- 08-22 McKinsey presentation, slide 10, PPLPC012000437356 from John PPLP004409919; pg. 8, P PLP004409965. from Edward Mahony, PPLPC012000448839-8 40. 192 during which period sales visits in Massachusetts increased by 30%.689 575. In November, staff reported to Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman that key initiatives during the third quarter of 2013 were getting doctors to prescribe OxyContin to opioid- naive patients and elderly patients on Medicare. Staff showed Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman how Purdue's tactic of using opioid savings cards to keep patients on OxyContin longer was working, and that Butrans sales had been above Purdue's forecasts. Nevertheless, staff told the Board that Purdue's 2013 profits were still hundreds of millions of dollars below target, and this shortfall was almost entirely due to the ongoing decline in high- dose and high- volume OxyContin prescriptions.690 576. Staff also reported to Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman, that a key initiative in 2013 was training sales reps to keep patients on Butrans longer. Staff told them that Purdue's launch of a new, high dose form of Butrans that, after being included in the E2E marketing push, had received initial orders double what the company had forecast. Staff reported that marketing and sales activities generated 266,842 additional Purdue opioid prescriptions and again highlighted opioid savings cards as a promotional coup.691 577. Staff reported to Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman that Purdue had sent more than 880,000 emails to health care professionals to promote its Butrans opioid, and posted online advertising seen more than 5 million times for Butrans and nearly 4 million times for OxyContin. Staff told them that this national campaign presented the same \"key selling messages\" designed to get more patients on OxyContin 689 2013- 11-01 Board report, pg. 11, PPLPC002000186921; Exhibit 1. 690 2013- 11-01 Board report, -923, -937. 193 at higher doses for longer periods of time, and specifically promoted Purdue's opioid savings cards.692 Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman understood and intended that the sales campaign hit Massachusetts. 2014 578. In early 2014, staff told Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman that again, the company's promotion of its opioids was working, and had generated an additional 560,036 prescriptions of OxyContin in 2012 and 2013, but this increase was still drastically below the number of opioids Purdue wanted to sell.693 Like before , this gap was attributed to \"continued pressure against higher doses [and] long term use of opioids,\" as wel l as new FDA labeling language instructing prescribers to prescribe OxyContin only to patients for whom alternative therapies were inadequate.694 579. At 2014's first Board meeting in February, staff presented Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman with samples of new opioid messaging and sales analysis on further methods to \"maximize revenue and profitability for both Butrans and OxyContin.\" Staff also reviewed plans to continue Purdue's core marketing tactics, including the \"Key Initiative\" to cause p atients to \"stay on therapy longer,\" the Individualize The Dose campaign, opioid savings cards, and the campaigns targeting elderly and opioid naive patients.695 580. Staff also told the Board that Purdue's OxyContin eMarketing campaign had reached 84,250 healt h care providers during the fourth quarter of 2013.696 581. As in the past, staff informed Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman, about 692 -926.

Staff reported to them that Purdue was developing language to modify Massachus etts legislation on opioid prescriptions .697 582. Staff also noted an unusually high number of compliance concerns with the content of Purdue's speaker programs, in which the company paid doctors to promote Purdue opioids or messaging to other doctors, causing Purdue to mail out corrective letters to attendees in some cases.698 583. In April, staff reported to Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman, together with the Sacklers, that Purdue employed 643 sales reps.699 Staff told them that visits by sales reps to doctors were essential to drive prescriptions of Purdue opioids: a drop in sales visits had reduced Butrans prescriptions, underscoring how crucial prescriber visits were to Purdue's profits.700 584. In July, staff told Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman, yet again, that Purdue's OxyContin business was threatened by \"[c]ontinued pressure against higher doses of opioids,\" and \"[c]ontinued pressure against long term use of opioids.\"701 585. In October, staff sent Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman a Proposed Operating Plan and Budget for 2015, which cited \"key tactics\" of inducing doctors to convert patients from short -acting opioids to OxyContin, and moving patients taking Butrans to higher doses.702 The budget predicted that prescribers' continued s hift away from the highest doses and larger prescriptions of OxyContin would now cost 697 2014- 02-04 Board report pg. 43, PPLPC002000181077 (bill concerned interchange ability of prescriptions). 698 2014- 02-04 Board report pgs. 39- 40, PPLPC002000181073- 074. 699 2014- 04-14 financial report to Board, pg. 7, PPLPC012000473138. 700 2014- 03-31 results of operations report, slide 7, PPLPC012000473131 . 701 2014- 07-01 702 2014- 10-24 email from Edward Mahoney, PPLPC016000260660; 2015 Commercial Budget Review, slides 31, 51, PPLPC016000260706- 726. 195 Purdue $99,000,000 that year.703 586. The budget also explained Purdue's plans to continue sales force expansion to promote the launch of its new opioid Hysingla.704 587. On December 31, Judith Lewent resigned from the Board. 2015 588. Purdue's efforts to overcome the decline in high- dose and high -volume opioid prescribing through aggressive sales calls continued in 2015. In April, staff told Boer, Costa, Pickett, an d Snyderman that sales of Purdue's highest dose of OxyContin were down 20% and that the average number of tablets per prescription had declined by eight tablets since 2011. Staff reported that Purdue employed 508 sales reps and another 57 as contract work ers. Boer, Costa, Pickett, and Snyderman voted to expand the sales force by adding another 122 reps, based on a prediction that this would increase net sales of opioids by $59,000,000.705 589. In December, Boer, Costa, and Snyderman demanded more information on sales and marketing tactics. Boer asked for an update on the Region Zero prescribers Purdue had flagged as possible illegal diverters, which included prescribers in Massachusetts. Costa sought a briefing on adjustments made to the distribution of sales t erritories throughout the country. Snyderman directed staff to break out sales data by indication versus prescriber specialty for each drug. Snyderman also wanted more information about the impact of Purdue's sales force on prescriptions.706 703 2015 Budget Submission, slide 6, PPLPC016000260845. 704 2015 Commercial Budget Review, slide 67, P PLPC016000260742. 705 2015- 05-21 Board materials, pg -700, -703, -707. 706 12 -14, PPLPC011000073230. 196 2016 590. In 2016, Boer, Costa, Pickett, and Snyderman participated in Board meetings with the Sacklers in January, March, April, June, August, October, November, and December.707 As of the date of this Amended Complaint, Purdue has not disclosed the records of those meetings, although it has promised to disclose them in the coming days. 2017 - 2018 591. In 2017, Boer, Costa, Pickett, and Snyderman participated in Board meetings with the Sacklers in January, March, April, June, August, and October.708 592. In October 2017, Snyderman resigned from the Board.709 593. In January 2018, Costa resigned from the Board.710 594. Boer and Pickett remained. 595. Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman each collected from opioid sales in Massachusetts. In exchange for the money, Boer, Lewent, Pickett, Costa, and Snyderman did what the Sacklers wanted every step of the way. They each knowingly, intentionally, and repeatedly directed Purdue's unfair and deceptive sales and marketing campaign in Massachusetts, to the great cost of patients and families. 707 2016- 05-19 Executive Committee pre -read, pg. 3, PPLPC011000096794. 708 2017- 03-23 Executive Committee presentation, slide 3, PPLPC011000139651. 709 Ralph Snyderman declaration. 710 Paulo Costa declaration. 197 C. John Stewart, Russell Gasdia, Mark Timney, and Craig Landau 596. The Sacklers relied on four key executives to get more patients in Massachusetts to take more opioids at higher doses for longer periods of time. These executives \u2014 John Stewart, Russell Gasdia, Mark Timney, and Craig Landau \u2014 are personally liable for their role in the unlawful scheme. JOHN STEWART 597. As CEO from 2007 to 2013, John Stewart headed up Purdue's unfair and deceptive campaign to get more Massachusetts residents to take more opioids at higher doses for longer periods of time. The Sacklers found Stewart, a long-time veteran of Purdue, . 711 598. Stewart knowingly and intentionally sent sales reps to promote opioids in Massachusetts. At his direction, Purdue's sales reps visited Massachusetts prescribers more than 70,000 times. 712 Stewart, in collaboration with sales executives like Russell Gasdia, recommended that Purdue increase the size of the sales force several times, more than doubling the number of sales reps during his tenure. After the Sacklers approved each expansion, Stewart ensured that the additional sales reps were deployed to sell opioids to prescribers in Massachusetts and beyond. 599. Stewart, a long -time employee of Purdue prior to becoming CEO, sent a memo to Jonathan and Kathe Sackler in 1997, which showed that he knew then that when people use high doses of opioids for longer periods, they are more likely to suffer adverse effects.713 Despite this 711 2008- 04-18 memo from Richard Sackler, PDD9316300631. 712 Exhibit 1 713 1997- 04-12 memo from John Stewart, PDD1701785443 . 198 knowledge, as CEO, Stewart led Purdue's strategy to drive patients to take opioids at higher doses for longer periods of time to mee t the Sacklers' sales goals. 600. Stewart knew and intended that the sales reps in Massachusetts would increase opioid sales by misleading doctors and concealing the true risks of Purdue's opioids . 601. Stewart also knew and intended that Purdue staff reporting to him would engage in thousands of additional deceptive acts in Massachusetts, including sending misleading publications to Massachusetts doctors and engaging in deceptive promotion of Purdue opioids at Boston University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and T ufts University. 602. Stewart knowingly and intentionally sought to conceal his misconduct. 2007 603. In May 2007 \u2014 immediately after the 2007 convictions \u2014 Stewart began planning to expand Purdue's sales force in Massachusetts and across the country. Even though Purdue sales reps were already visiting Massachusetts prescribers more than 1,000 times each month, Stewart and Sales VP Russell Gasdia worked to quantify the \"market impact\" that adding sales reps would have.714 604. In June , Stewart me t with Purdue's sales managers, including the Massachusetts district and regional managers, to present his vision for selling opioids.715 605. In July, Stewart received the first of more than twenty reports he would receive during his tenure as CEO, detailing the number and breadth of Purdue's sales reps across the country, including in Massachusetts. Staff also told Stewart that Purdue received 572 Reports of 714 2007- 05-29 email from John email from Russell Gasdia, PPLPC012000145260. 199 Concern about abuse and diversion of Purdue opioids during Q2 2007 \u2014 including several reports from Massachusetts.716 606. Staff told Stewart that Purdue had mailed 12,528 marketing pieces to prescribers and others in the first half of 2007. The most -distributed item was volume #1 of Purdue's \"Focused and Customized Education Topic Selections in Pain Management \" (FACETS),717 which falsely instructed doctors and patients that physical dependence on opioids is not dangerous and instead improves patients' \"quality of life.\" FACETS also falsely told doctors and patients that signs of addiction are actually \"pseudoaddi ction,\" and that doctors should respond by prescribing more opioids.718 Staff told Stewart that another of the publications they had sent most often to doctors was \" Complexities in Caring for People in Pain.\"719 In it, Purdue repeated again its false claim t hat warning signs of addiction are really \"pseudoaddiction\" that should be treated with more opioids.720 607. Under Stewart's oversight, Purdue sent both of those misleading materials to doctors in Massachusetts hundreds of times.721 608. In September , Stewart approved distributing the deceptive book Responsible Opioid Prescribing, sponsored by Purdue, which reinforced Purdue's deceptive message that the clear majority of patients were \"trustworthy,\" meaning that they were not vulnerable to addiction.722 716 2007- 07-15 Board report, pg. 33, 52, \"Focused and Customized Education Topic Selections in Pain Management\", Vol. 1, pg s. 51, 53, PTN000004691, -693. 719 2007- 07-15 200709 -03 \"Complexities of Caring pg. email from John Stewart, PWG000184869 . 200 609. As Stewart continued to work to expand the sales force, he knew that the national Blue Cross/Blue Shield association instructed its members, including Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Massachusetts, to not partner with Purdue, because the association was \"concerned about what [Purdue's] sales people were telling doctors.\" 723 610. In October, Stewart reported to the Board that Purdue received 284 Reports of Concern about abuse and diversion of Purdue's opioids in the most recent quarter and 39 tips to Purdue's compliance hotline. 724 Never theless, staff told Stewart and the Board that they should authorize a sales force expansion because the existing force was \"unable to cover a large percentage of high prescribers.\" 725 2008 611. In January 2008, staff told Stewart that, in 2007, Purdue's net sales were just over $1 billion, almost \"DOUBLE\" what the company had planned with OxyContin making up more than 90% of those sales. Staff also told Stewart that they represented Purdue at the Massachusetts General Hospital Purdue Pharma Pain Center in Boston on November 1 and at a Tufts University course on \"Pain Policy: Opioid Laws and Policies\" in Boston on October 31. 726 612. In February, the Board .727 As a result, Stewart knew and intended that more sales reps would promote opioids to prescribers in Massachusetts by misleading doctors and concealing the true risks of Purdue's opioids. In fact, sales reps newly hired in the 2008 expansion promoted Purdue opioids 723 2007- 09-30 email from Russell Gasdia, PPLPC012000156284 . 2007- Board report, 60, PPLPC0120001574 37, -461. 725 2007- 10-26 email from Russell Gasdia, PPLPC012000159020 ; 2007- 10-25 & Marketing presentation, slide 4, PPLPC012000159022. 726 2008- 01-15 Board report, pg -997. 727 2008- 02-08 Board 201 to Massachusetts prescribers more than 13,000 times.728 613. Stewart wrote to Richard Sackler that Purdue's reformulated OxyContin with so - called abuse -deterrent properties \"will not stop patients from the simple act of taking too many pills.\"729 Still, Stewart worked to include abuse -deterrent claims in the label of reformulated OxyContin and heralded the reformulation of OxyContin as a solution to the problems caused by opioid abuse, misleadingly focusing on crushing and injecting even though he knew that swallowing intact pills is the most common form of abuse.730 614. In March , Stewart presented the details of the OxyContin savings card program to the Board. He explained that offering savings cards increased the share of patients who use branded OxyContin by fifteen percent.731 615. In April, staff told Stewart they promoted Purdue's opioids in Massachusetts at Tufts Health Care Institute's program on Opioid Risk Management in Boston on March 27.732 616. In July, staff told Stewart that Purdue had bought one hundred new Pontiac Vibes to shuttle around the expanded Sales Force he had proposed. Staff also told Stewart that they promoted Purdue's opioids to clinicians, fellows, and medical residents in Massachusetts in a presentation titled \"The Assessment and M anagement of Chronic Pain with an Emphasis on the Appropriate Use of Opioid Analgesics \" at the Tufts University MSPREP Program in Boston on April 25; and in a presentation titled \" The Role of Urine Drug and other Biofluid Assays in Pain Management ,\" at the Tufts Health Care Institute's program on Opioid Risk Management in 728 Exhibit 1. 729 2008- 02-22 email from John Stewart, PPLPC012000172201. 730 2010- 10-27 email from John Stewart, PDD8901374440; 2010- 04-28 email from John Stewart, PDD8901562111; 2011 -09-28 presentation by John Stewart, slides 9- 11, PWG000245725 -727; 2011- 09-28 presentation by John Stewart, slides 23 -30, PWG000245754 -761; 2012 -03-06 speech b y John Stewart, 03-07 , 04-15 Board report, pg. 16, PDD8901724449. 202 Boston on June 26 and 27.733 Convincing Massachusetts doctors that Purdue opioids were the best way to manage chronic pain and that urine tests protected patients from addiction were both part of Purdue's deceptive scheme. 617. In October , staff told Stewart that the sales force expansion had been implemented and Purdue now employed 414 sales reps \u2014 an increase of more than 100 reps.734 The expansion of the sales force that Stewart had recommended had its intended effect in Massachusetts: during the third quarter of 2008, Purdue sales reps visited Massachusetts prescribers more than 1,800 times \u2014 a 20% increase compared to the same period in 2007.735 2009 618. In March 2009, Stewart and Richard Sackler discussed a decline in OxyContin's market share. Both men wanted more. Stewart stressed that it would not be enough merely to get patients onto Purdue opioids, but that they needed to get patients onto the most profitable prescription s: \"the key consideration is more likely to be Purdue's share of the $ market (as opposed to Rx's) .\"736 Both men knew that the most profitable prescriptions were those for the highest doses. 619. In April, staff told Stewart that Purdue had increased prescribers' use of high dose opioids: \"for the first time since January 2008, OxyContin 80mg strength tablets e xceeded the 40mg strength tablets during December 2008.\" Staff also told Stewart that Purdue received 122 tips to its compliance hotline during first quarter 2009, including tips regarding improper use of OxyContin marketing materials and opioid savings c ards.737 733 2008- 07-15 Board report, pg s. 21 , 30, PPLP004367317, -326. 734 2008-10-15 Board report, pg. 26, PDD9316101027. 735 Exhibit 1. 736 2009- 03-18 email from John Stewart, PPLPC012000216786. Board report, pgs. 5, 24-25, 203 620. In June , Stewart .\"738 621. In October, staff told Stewart and the Board: \"The Sales Force expanded by an additional 50 territories as of July 2009,\" and Purdue had hired even more sales reps since, to total 475 sales reps in all. Staff reinforced earlier reports that a nationwide review of District Managers in the sales force had required extensive corrective action, but Stewart did not follow up that report with any discipline for executives. 739 622. In November, following a question from Richard Sackler, staff told Stewart and the Board that Purdue promoted OxyContin as reducing pain faster, having less variability in blood levels, and working for more pain conditions than competitor products. 740 Stewart knew that there was no support for these claims in OxyContin's FDA- approved labeling. 623. That same month, Stewart sought Board approval to resume funding the Massachusetts General Hospital Purdue Pharma Pain Program to promote Purdue's opioids in Massachusetts.741 624. In December, Stewart prepared 2010 objectives for the sales and marketing team, including how many times sales reps should visit prescribers to promote opioids and how managers should supervise the reps. Stewart wrote that the target for face -to-face promo tion John Stewart, PPL PC012000242813; 2009- 10-22 Board report, pgs. 4, 16, 21, 204 prescribers would be 540,000 sales visits, and staff would have to report the number of sales visits, compared to the target and compared to the prior year, at the end of every quarter.742 2010 625. In January 2010, Stewart informed staff about the Board's decision to increase the sales target to $3.1 billion in sales, more than $100 million more than in 2009.743 626. In February, staff reported to the Board Stewart's sales objective of at least 545,000 visits to prescribers to promote Purdue opioids in year 2010.744 That target rose to 712,000 visits in 2011, 752,417 in 2012, and 744,777 in 2013.745 627. At Stewart's urging, , so that Purdue employed 490 sales reps nationwide, including 14 in Massachusetts.746 628. Staff regularly told Stewart exactly how many times Purdue sales reps visited prescribers to promote opioids in the most recent three months, how that total compared to the budget, how many prescribers an average rep visited on an average day, and what Purdue staff were doing to increase the number of opioid sales visits. 629.

In March , Stewart requested a report about the Massachusetts OxyContin and Heroin commission, which the legislature had formed in 2008 to understand the thousands of opioid-related deaths. The commission reported, among other things: \"Addiction to the powerful painkiller, OxyContin, became evident almost immediately following FDA approval of the drug in 1995.\" 749 631. That same month, Stewart .750 Stewart . 632. In April, Stewart formally approved the sales target of 545,000 OxyContin calls on prescribers for the year 2010.751 633. That same month, staff reported to Stewart and the Board that OxyContin was so risky Purdue could not get product liability insurance for it. Staff told Stewart that they were pushing back against the \"threat\" of public health rules that would limit high doses of opioids. They told Stewart that Purdue would oppose measures that asked doctors to consult with pain specialists before putting patients on high doses of opioids. 752 748 2010- 02-16 Executive Committee PPLPC01200 0431279 John Stewart, PPLPC012000266606 ; 2010- 04-06 Marketing & Sales draft for Board report, PPLPC012000266607. 752 2010- 04-21 Board report, pg s. 15-16, PWG000423154- 155. 2010- 10 budget submission, pg. 29, PDD9273201317. In November 2010, staff reported to the Board that Purdue had collected $343,800,000 in liability insura nce payments, including $151,700,000 for settlements and $192,100,000 for legal fees. 206 634. In June , Stewart presented t he Board with the projected number of sales reps to promote each Purdue product over the next 10 years.753 Stewart approved the mix of products the sales force was already promoting and applauded their progress on meeting targets.754 635. In July, Stewart invited sales and marketing managers to attend the board meeting and strategize even more sales force expansion.755 Stewart knew and intended that, because of this undertaking, more sales reps would promote opioids to prescribers in Massachusetts. In fact, new sales reps hired in the 2010 expansion promoted Purdue opioids to Massachusetts prescribers more than 4,000 times.756 636. In September , Stewart and Gasdia discussed how sales reps should talk to doctors about reformulated OxyContin. In the wake of 770 call s in one week from patients, caretakers, and prescribers to Purdue for concerns like adverse events, Stewart told Gasdia to have sales reps stay on message. He told Gasdia that there was no need to have sales reps say more on these issues with prescribers. 757 Stewart frequently made decisions about what sales reps should say to doctors, and sales reps in Massachusetts used the words and phrases that Stewart chose. 637. In October , staff told Stewart that Purdue employed 506 sales reps and that, during the thi rd quarter 2010, they visited prescribers 141,116 times.758 More than 2,600 of those visits were in Massachusetts.759 638. Staff reported to Stewart and the Board that Purdue would promote opioids at more than a dozen programs in Massachusetts.760 753 2010- 06-15 email from John Stewart, PPLPC012000275713. minutes, PKY183212838; 2010- 07-20 email John Stewart, PPLPC012000279588. 756 Exhibit 1. 757 2010- 09-08 email from John Stewart, PPLPC012000286538. 758 2010- 10-25 Board report, pg s. 3, 26, PWG000421967, -990. 759 Exhibit 1. 207 639. That same month, Stewart .761 640. Stewart .\"762 641. In November, Stewart traveled to Massachusetts to promote Purdue's opioids. He met with Massachusetts General Hospital to discuss Purdue's grant.763 Ultimately, Stewart would obtain for MGH an additional $500,000 per year for three years from the Board, with the goal of increasing prescriptions of opioids, including OxyContin.764 MGH produced a Purdue- funded program called \"Advances in Managing Chronic Pain.\"765 642. In December , Stewart informed the Board that \"region 0 accounts for much of the [prescription] decline at the regional level\" after the reformulation of OxyContin.766 Region Zero was Purdue's list of suspicious prescribers, which it stopped promoting to, but continued to profit from, by failing to report them to authorities. 643. On Christmas Eve , Stewart reviewed printed marketing materials and sales rep training for Butrans, including the titration guide which Purdue trained its sales reps to use to push doctors to prescribe higher and more profitable doses.767 760 The programs wer e at Massachusetts institutions Tufts University, Boston University, Pri -Med Institute, Northeastern University, Massachusetts College of Pharmacy, and American Health Resources. 2010 -10-07 report attached to email by William Ma llin, pgs. 3, 5, 10, 13, 16, 26, 28, 33, PPLPC012000292676, William Ma llin, PPLPC012000292759 -60. 761 2010- 11-10 Executive Committee notes , PPLPC012000299855; 2010- Bert Weinstein, PPLPC017000311119 -120. 2010- by John Stewart, slide 4, PPLPC012000300458. 767 2010- 12-24 email from John 12-23 proposed Butrans titration guide, PPLPC002000086956. 208 2011 644. In January 2011, staff told Stewart and the Board that Purdue employed 590 sales reps and that, during the most recent quarter, they visited prescribers 125,712 times.768 More than 2,900 of those visits were in Massachusetts.769 645. Staff also reported to Stewart that Purdue had completed one of its key initiatives that Stewart had proposed; it hired 74 more sales reps during Q4 2010 and planned to hire 51 more reps during Q1 2011.770 646. In February, staff gave Stewart and the Board a map correlating dangerous prescribers in Massachusetts with reports of oxycodone poisoning, burglaries, and robberies. Staff told Stewart and the Board that the company was receiving a steadily rising volume of hotline calls and other compliance matters, reaching an all -time high during October, November, and December 2010. 771 Staff also presented an analysis of penalties imposed on pharmaceutical companies for illegal marketing. That analysis concluded that pena lties for breaking the law are \"relatively small . . . compared to the perpetrating companies' profits.\"772 647. Later that month, Stewart .773 648. In March , Richard Sackler asked Stewart and others to explain to the Board the barriers that sales reps were encountering in their promotion and \"what [was] being done to 768 2011- 01-24 Board report, pg s. 4, 35, PWG000421551, -582. 769 Exhibit 1. 770 4, PWG000421551. 771 2011- 02-03 presentation by Bert PDD8901468038, -109. 772 2010- 12-16 study by In April , Stewart met w ith Gasdia to form a plan to reverse declining Butrans sales.775 Stewart tracked sales numbers and sought to head off problems by aggressive marketing. In May , Stewart co -authored Purdue's plans to increase targeting of high prescribers, which included fur ther expanding the sales force.776 649. When Jonathan Sackler complained to Stewart about sales (\"This is starting to look ugly\"), Stewart turned around and ordered Sales VP Russell Gasdia to increase prescriptions.777 Stewart gave Gasdia 48 hours to deliver a co mprehensive plan: \"the action plan should have elements specifically directed at: sales force call targeting; sales force prescriptions by representative (range from high to low, and what ' performance improvement plans ' are being put in place for those in the lowest deciles; key questions/obstacles being identified from the field and medical services, and how they are being addressed; what other information the sales force feels will help boost sales; the current situation with each of the major MCOs [manag ed care organizations] , and the plan and targets going forward (with specific dates); and key marketing activities and their start date that by themselves may help boost sales .\"778 650. That same month, staff told Stewart and the Board that Purdue had hired 47 more sales reps in the most recent expansion and now employed 639. Staff told Stewart and the Board that, during the first quarter of 2011, the sales reps visited prescribers 173,647 times during.779 More than 3,800 of those visits were in Massachusetts.780 651. In June , Stewart, in discussion with Landau and others, recognized that Purdue's opioid sales were hundreds of millions of dollars less than expected, in part, because doctors 774 2011- 02-25 email from Richard Sackler, PPLPC012000313544 . 775 email from John Stewart, PPLPC012000321001. 05-01 email from John Stewart, PPLPC012000322363 ; business strategy draft, PPLPC012000322364 . 777 2011- email from Jonathan Sackler, PPLPC01200032609 7. 778 2011- 05-25 email from John Stewart, PPLPC012000326096. 779 2011- report, pg s. 5-6, 36, PPLPC0120003224 30-431, -461. 780 Exhibit 1. 210 were prescribing the highest doses less often.781 Those decreases in prescribing in cluded reductions of $300 million by prescribers who had been placed in Region Zero.782 652. Continuing in June, Gasdia told Stewart that early Butrans sales were trending up, and that the next strategy to sell even more Butrans was \"increasing call frequency to the highest prescribers.\"783 653. In August , Stewart informed Gasdia that lower -than-expected OxyContin sales were due to decreased demand for the highest strengths \u2014 setting the stage for another push to get doctors to prescribe higher doses.784 654. In Se ptember , Stewart gave a speech titled Providing Relief, Preventing Abuse in Connecticut, which deceptively blamed the addiction, overdose, and death on \"abuse\" \u2014 deploying Richard Sackler's time -worn strategy to \" hammer on the abusers in every way possible\" \u2014 to draw attention away from how dangerous Purdue opioids were for everyone.785 655. In October , Stewart pushed Gasdia for information on the Butrans sales projections and threatened to cut Purdue's marketing and sales investment if Gasdia couldn't turn from John 09-28 presentation by John Stewart, PWG000245717 Richard Sackler, 10-12 email from Joh n Stewart, PPLPC012000347134. 211 2012 656. In January 2012, Stewart had his staff report to the Board that Purdue employed 632 sales reps.787 In the fourth quarter of 2011, they visited Massachusetts prescribers more than 3,600 times.788 657. In February, staff told Stewart that patients on higher doses of Butrans stayed on that opioid longer, and that sales reps would press doctors to move patients to higher doses rapidly to keep them on Butrans longer. This reinforced Stewart's strategy to promote higher doses. 789 658. In March , Gasdia pleaded with Stewart to try to trim back Richard Sackler's micromanagement of sales. Stewart replied that \"I work on this virtually every day,\" and asked Gasdia to continue to \"spur me to get involved directly.\" 790 659. That same week , Stewart gave another Providing Relief, Preventing Abuse speech making the same misleading statements as before: that pain is undertreated and t hat patients are to blame for addiction, overdose, and death because of \"abuse.\" Stewart used these tactics to draw attention away from how dangerously addictive Purdue's opioids were for everyone.791 660. In March , Stewart also created another 10 -year projection, emphasizing that \"one - on-one interactions between healthcare professionals and the company's Sales and Marketing staff will be the primary driver\" of prescriptions. Stewart also planned for Purdue to continue to push under -treatment of pain as a major message. Finally, the plan highlighted that sales could be increased by falsely convincing doctors that they could and should prescribe more to patients 787 2012- 01-25 Board report, pg. 48, PPLPC012000362291 . 788 Exhibit 1. 789 2012- 02-12 Rosen , PPLPC012000364028- 029. email from from Joseph Pisani, PWG 000217342 . 212 deemed to have low risk of addiction and that patients who were at risk of addiction were really just illegal drug users.792 661. In April, Stewart continued his focus on higher doses. He wrote to Gasdia that Richard Sackler's frustrations about both Butrans and OxyContin could be linked to dosing. He encouraged Gasdia to tell Sackler that patients on lower doses seemed to stop taking opioids sooner, and that much of the profit that Purdue had lost had been from doctors backing off the highest dose of OxyContin (80mg). 793 662. In May , Stewart reiterated to Gasdia the importance of getting prescribers to use higher doses and doing so \"faster than the projections indicate.\" He told Gasdia that the lowest dose of Butrans should be \"considered more of a starter dose\" from which Purdue would encourage almost everyone to move up. This would enable Purdue to collect \"more $ value per script.\" Stewart told Gasdia that he would join Gasdia's team in their detailed Butrans performance review to get their sales strategy straight for the mid -year meeting with the Board. 794 663. In June, Stewart directed one of his staff to attend the International Conference on Opioids, which was held at Harvard Medical School in Boston that month. Staff reported that people at the conference compared Purdue to the tobacco companies. 795 664. In July, Stewart .\" 792 2012- 03-27 business strategy plan, pgs. 8, 10, 30, PWG000164127, -129, -149. 793 from John from Russell Gasdia, PPLPC012000380788 . 213 . 796 The following year, Purdue's sales reps called on one of the highest- prescribing Massachusetts doctors more than a hundred times.797 665. That month, Stewart reported to the Board that Massachusetts n ow allowed drug companies to use copay savings cards and to host dinners for doctors to promote their drugs.798 666. In August, Stewart .\" Stewart also .\" 799 One of those \"high ROI targets\" in Massachusetts, Walter Jacobs, lost his license due to unlawful overprescribing in 2012, after years of being Purdue's paid spokesman and top prescriber in the Commonwealth. 667. Stewart knew how sales visits influenced prescribing. In October, Stewart and Gasdia discussed directing the sales force to focus more on OxyContin and less on Butrans because the increase in OxyContin sales would be greater than the reduction in Butran s sales. 800 668. That same month , Stewart directed his staff to draft an email, that he then reviewed and edited, briefing the Board on Purdue's objections to proposals by Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing which sought to limit the number of patients on opioids, their 796 2012- 06-15 email from John Stewart, PPLPC012000383032; 2012- 06-14 memo on project, PPLPC012000382450 ; 2012 -07-12 email from John Stewart, PPLPC012000383138 ; 2013 -09-05 r Report, pg. email from John Stewart, PPLPC012000388080; 2012- 07-11 overview of studies for Board report, PPLPC012000388087- 088. 800 2012- 10-10 email from John Stew art, PPLPC012000394639. 214 doses, and the duration of use.801 2013 669. In early 2013, Stewart and his staff continued to reinforce the Individualize The Dose campaign, which Stewart knew and intended would promote higher doses. Stewart and his sales staff also focused on promoting use of the opioid savings cards, including giving cash bonuses to sales reps for driving their use, which Stewart knew and intended would keep patients on opioids longer.802 670. In February, Stewart drafted proposed sales scripts around the abuse- deterrent formulation of OxyContin, such as: \"Reflecting the depth of its commitment to drug safety and patient health, Purdue Pharma has introduced an abuse -deterrent formulation of OxyContin tablets - that is difficult to m anipulate for the purpose of intentional abuse, misuse, and diversion.\"803 Although Stewart knew the reformulation would not deter abuse by swallowing pills \u2014 the most common route of abuse \u2014 the sales scripts did not disclose that. Rather, they focused on crushing and dissolving to deceive doctors into believing that the reformulation was safe.804 Stewart and the team d\u00e9buted these messages to the sales force in May, and sales reps began using them thereafter. 671. In May , Stewart continued writing sales pitches for the abuse -deterrent formulation of OxyContin.805 Again, none of those statements disclosed that swallowing pills is most common form of abuse.806 Stewart discussed his sales pitches with top executives, and the 801 2012- 10-03 email from John Stewart , PWG000415151 Board re port, pg.

Stewart hand -edited a presentation explaining that the decrease in high dose prescriptions was causing d eclining revenue, and that Purdue would respond by: making more OxyContin sales calls, pressing forward with the Individualize The Dose campaign, and promoting opioid savings cards. Stewart intended that these initiatives would get patients on higher dose s for longer periods.808 Stewart's notes on a slide identifying the problem of lower sales in higher doses Stewart's notes on a slide with Purdue's plan to address the problem 807 2013- 05-03 email from Ronald Cadet, PPLPC012000421795 . 808 2013- 05-22 mid -year sales update, slides 4, 14, PPLPC012000424611, - 621. 216 673. Meanwhile, staff reported to Stewart and the Board that they were continuing to use opioid savings cards to get patients to \"remain on therapy longer.\" Staff told Stewart that they were now using direct mail and email, as well as in person sales visits, to push the opioid savings cards. 809 674. Despite these sales efforts, Stewart knew that Purdue was losing tens of millions of dollars in revenue because fewer patients were being prescribed higher doses of opioids and patients were being prescribed fewer pills in each prescription. Staff told Stewart: \"there is an 'unfavorable' mix of prescriptions across strengths,\" and sales of the highest doses were too low. Staff reminded Stewart of the second problem: \"lower average tablet counts per prescription.\" 810 675. In July, Stewart directed Gasdia to develop a way to \"identify consistently low performers\" in the sales force. He also instructed Gasdia to tell the sales force that they should be doing half of their calls on OxyContin, half on Butrans. 811 676. That same month, staff told Stewart and the Board that OxyContin sales had dropped $96,400,000 f rom the year before because Purdue had fewer sales reps selling OxyContin to doctors.812 Stewart .813 677. Meeting with his External Affairs Committee, Stewart discussed concerns about \"threats\" from \"data on long term use of opioids.\"814 Stewart knew in 1997 that long term use leads to more adverse events and he was worried that the public was figuring it out.815 809 2013- 05-13 Board report, pg. 18, PPLP004367557. 810 05-13 Board report, pg. 8, PPLP004367547. 811 from John Stewart, John Stewart, PPLPC012000431262. 2013- 07-24 and External Affairs Committee minutes, PPLPC012000433553. 815 1997- 03-12, memo from John Stewart, PDD1701785443. 217 678. Stewart and his staff continued to focus on \"the decline in higher strengths\" of Purdue opioids, and the decline in \"tablets per Rx,\" which were reducing Purdue's profit. One \"specific concern\" for Purdue had been Massachusetts legislation to essentially ban OxyContin in Massachusetts, which Purdue had advocated against and defeated. 816 Stewart knew and intended that Purdue was promoting and selling OxyContin in the Commonwealth. 679. Staff also reported to Stewart that they had trained Purdue's sales reps to use new sales materials designed t o get patients on higher doses of opioids for longer periods. Purdue employed 634 sales reps and, during the second quarter of 2013, they visited prescribers 177,773 times. Staff assured Stewart that they were trying to increase sales visits by increasin g communication to sales representatives and monitoring sales reps more closely. 817 During that quarter, Purdue sales reps visited Massachusetts prescribers more than 2,400 times.818 680. In August, Stewart presented to the Board about OxyContin growth opportunities. He identified diminished use of the highest doses as a major factor in declining sales and explained that OxyContin prescriptions would increase with more sales calls.819 681. That same month , .820 . 816 2013- 07-23 Board -439. 817 2013- -446. 818 Exhibit 1. 819 2013- 08-14 presentation by John Stewart and Russell Gasdia, slides 2, 4, PPLPC012000436355 . 820 2013- 08-22 email Russell Gasdia, interim report). 218 .821 682. In September , Stewart initiated Project Turbocharge , to drastically increase OxyContin sales calls and change the way Purdue targets prescribers.822 This initiative was renamed E2E: Evolve to Excellence and would be the theme of the 2014 National Sales Meeting.823 683. Also in September, Stewart told the Board he was working to oppose the incorporation of 90-day limits into the FDA's pain management guidelines or regulations.824 Stewart knew that patients who stay on opioids longer have more adverse events, but that they were also more profitable for Purdue.825 In fact, in Massachusetts, patients who use opioids for longer than 90 days are thirty times more likely to die of opioid- related overdoses than the general population. 684. Later that month, Stewart criticized Gasdia and other s taff for being \"overly conservative\" in their communications with doctors. Stewart directed that sales reps should promote Purdue's opioids for \"moderate persistent pain\" even though the FDA had removed the word \"moderate\" from the drugs' indications. 826 685. In October, Stewart and Gasdia addressed concerns in the budget relating to the slowing growth in Butrans sales. Their new scheme to boost Butrans sales was to target 821 2013- 08-22 presentation, slide 10 , PPLPC012000437356. 822 implementation plant, slide 5, PPLPC 012000441799. 824 2013- 09-11 email from John Stewart, from John Stewart, John 219 \"specific populations (e.g. the elderly).\"827 Stewart was instrumental in Purdue's strategy to target especially vulnerable patients. 686. In November , staff reported to Stewart that a key initiative during the third quarter of 2013 was for sales reps to promote OxyContin for patients who had never taken opioids before.828 In Massachusetts during 2013, Purdue sales reps reported to Purdue that they pushed opioids for opioid- naive patients dozens of times. The sales reps did not disclose to doctors that opioid na ive patients faced greater risks of overdose and death. 687. Staff reported to Stewart and the Board that another key initiative was for sales reps to encourage doctors to prescribe OxyContin to elderly patients on Medicare.829 In Massachusetts during those three months, sales reps reported to Purdue that they pushed opioids for \"elderly\" or \"Medicare\" patients more than 300 times. The sales reps did not consistently disclose to doctors that elderly patients faced greater risk of drug interactions, injuries, falls, and suffocating to death by taking OxyContin. Some sales reps even made claims that OxyContin did the opposite, for example, that it reduced the risk of falls. At least 23 Massachusetts patients aged 65 and older who were prescribed Purdue opioids later died of opioid- related overdoses. 688. Staff also told Stewart and the Board that analysis conducted in July showed that opioid savings cards earned the company more money by keeping patients on opioids longer; specifically, more patients stayed on OxyContin longer than 60 days. Staff reported that Purdue was pushing opioid savings cards through Purdue sales reps, through email to tens of thousands of health care providers, and online.830 827 2013- 11-12 email from John report, pg. 15, PPLPC002000186925. 11-01 Board report, pg. 15, PPLPC002000186925. 220 689. During 2013, Purdue sales reps promoted opioid savings cards to Massachusetts doctors thousands of times. The sales reps did not tell doctors that savings cards led patients to stay on opioids longer than 60 days, or that staying on opioids longer increased the risk of addiction and death. 690. Staff explained to Stewart and the Board that in the fourth quarter of 2013, sales reps would increase the number of visits to prescribers.831 In Massachusetts, during those three months, sales visits increased by 30%.832 691. Staff also reported to Stewart that a key initiative in 2013 was to train sales reps to keep patients on Butrans longer. They told Stewart that, at exactly the same time as the initiative to keep patients on opioids longer, Purdue launched a new high dose of its Butrans opioid. Sales reps began promoting the new high dose to physicians and initial orders were double the company's forecasts. Staff also reported to Stewart that marketing and sales activities generated 266,842 additional prescriptions and opioid savings cards generated especially \"high returns\" by keeping patients on opioids longer.833 692. Staff reported to Stewart and the Board that Purdue had sent more than 880,000 emails to health care professionals to promote its Butrans opioid, and posted online advertising garnering more than 5 million views for Butrans and nearly 4 million views for OxyContin. Staff told Stewart that these hundreds of thousands of communications pitched doctors with messages designed to get more patients on OxyContin at higher doses for longer periods of time.834 831 2013- 11-01 Board report, pg. 11, PPLPC002000186921. 832 1. 833 2013- 11-01 2013- 16, PPLPC0020001869 24, -926. 221 693. Staff also told Stewart and the Board that they would begin reviews of sales reps according to their sales ranking, with a focus on the bottom ten percent. They reported to Stewart that Purdue employed 637 sales reps and, during third quarter of 2013, they visited prescribers 179,640 times.835 More than 2,200 of those visits were in Massachusetts.836 694. In December , Stewart inform ed Kathe Sackler and Gasdia that Evolve 2 Excellence \u2014 the aggressive sales strategy \u2014 was already increasing prescriptions and revenue. Stewart knew and intended that these changes in sales practices would drive increased prescriptions, including in Mass achusetts.837 695. Stewart resigned from Purdue at the end of 2013.838 696. Stewart has collected substantial revenue from the sale of Purdue opioids in Massachusetts, as detailed in Exhibit 2. 697. While Stewart was Purdue's chief executive, at least 247 Massachusetts pat ients died of opioid- related overdoses after taking the drugs he sold. 835 2013- 11-01 Board report, pg s. 11, 52, 55, PPLPC002000186921, -962, -965. 836 Exhibit 1. 837 2013- 12-02 email from John Stewart, PPLPC012000454422. 838 John Stewart declaration. 222 RUSSELL GASDIA 698. Russell Gasdia worked at the heart of Purdue's deceptive sales campaign. From 2007 until 2014, Gasdia was Purdue's Vice President of Sales and Marketing. He was responsible for getting more patients on opioids, at higher doses, for longer periods of time.

Sackler, Strategic Initiatives 911 MARK TIMNEY 754. In January 2014, just a few months before Massachusetts declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency, Timney picked up as CEO where John Stewart left off, directing and overseeing the sale and marketing of Purdue's opioids and the expansion of the sales force, including in Massachusetts. Timney directed Purdue sales reps to target Massachusetts doctors to prescribe opioids to more patients, at higher doses, for longer pe riods of time. 755. When some health care systems stopped allowing sales reps to visit doctor's offices, Timney developed a work- around. Under his direction, Purdue created a call center where sales reps telephoned doctors and hospitals, including facilities w ith \"no -see\" policies, to encourage them to prescribe more opioids. 756. Timney received near -daily reports of opioid- related abuse, diversion, and overdoses, including in Massachusetts. 757. Rather than work to address the opioid epidemic, Timney devoted his tenure to preserving the Sacklers' narrative that addiction was the fault of abusers: promoting OxyContin as abuse- deterrent, without disclosing that the reformulation had no effect on the most common form of abuse \u2014 swallowing pills. 758. Starting in January and continuing for his entire time at Purdue, Timney regularly received internal reports \u2014 sometimes multiple times a day \u2014 that summarized media coverage of opioid- related issues. The reports included articles about doctors over -prescribing opioids, stories of people overdosing, drug abuse chatroom chatter, and more. After receiving these reports, Timney often followed up with requests to his staff to dig deeper on an item in that day's 240 summary.912 759. As CEO, Timney continued John Stewart's aggressive sales strategy known as Evolve 2 Excellence or E2E. In an updated presentation to Timney, .913 Timney knew and intended that Purdue sales reps aggressively target prolific prescribers. 760. Timney's Evolve 2 Excellence sales strategy also brought an increased focus on OxyContin, requiring sale reps to allocate two thirds of sales efforts to OxyContin and one third to Butrans, inst ead of the previous 50/50 split.914 761. In February, as a competitor prepared to launch another opioid, Timney directed that Purdue \"target KOLs who would respond\" with data showing why Purdue's opioids \"should be used in certain patients first.\" 915 762. In March \u00b8 Tim ney received updates from sales staff about the Evolve 2 Excellence sales strategy.916 Sales staff wrote among themselves that Timney had \"requested regular updates\" on the E2E project and that \"[t]here will continue to be a great deal of focus on the activity of the Sales Force as a measurement of whether we are making the necessary progress during 2014.\" 917 763. At the same time, Timney created a new way to reach physicians who did not allow sales reps in their clinics (no - and limited -access prescribers). Timney directed staff to set up a call center, where sales reps would call restricted -access prescribers and promote slide 7, PPLPC012000459931 . 914 2014- 01-17 241 opioids over the phone. Timney oversaw this and other initiatives to reach those prescribers, including email and digital marketing.918 764. In April, Timney worked with .919 765. In May , Timney reported to the Board about how, under his direction, Purdue had successfully lobbied for legislation in Massachuset ts that prohibited a non-abuse deterrent formulation from being dispensed if an abuse deterrent formulation of that drug was available. Timney touted this as a \"positive development\" \"in a state from which we've seen significant anti-opioid activity in re cent months\" and \"closely aligned with our commercial strategy.\" 920 766. When Richard Sackler expressed displeasure at the poor commercial performance of Butrans, Timney assured him \"We are turning over every opportunity with every product we have.\" 921 767. Later that month, Timney told the Board about the new sales initiative to target no- and limited- access prescribers through the call center and to target hospital networks, which had policies restricting sales rep visits.922 The initiative called for Purdue to focus on four \"high value geographies\" one of which was Massachusetts, including the Partners and Steward hospital systems. 923 Timney assured the Board that through these efforts, the sales force continued to target the highest volume prescribers and increase sales of Purdue's opioids. 768. In August, Timney sent the entire company a 100-days strategy update that keyed into his vision for how Purdue would sustain profitable growth for the Sacklers, by \"Competing, 918 2014- 03-11 Presentation for meeting with 2, PPLPC014000242643 2014- 06-06 , slide 16 , PVT0028327. 242 Winning, and Growing.\" The memo included an update spec ific to Massachusetts, noting the passage of legislation that reflected \"public policies championed by Purdue.\"924 Timney touted the Massachusetts legislation in a memo to the Board that month as well, while noting that staff from Corporate Affairs were coo rdinating the response to a developing Bloomberg / BusinessWeek story on the Sackler family.925 769. In September, as the launch date for Purdue's new opioid Hysingla approached, Timney directed staff to prepare a \"detailed, full blown, launch plan\" that he could review in detail.926 770. In October , at the direction of Timney, staff sent the Board advance copies of the 2015 proposed operating budget. 927 The materials included Timney's strategic plan of \"Compete, Win, Grow.\" Timney presented to the Board on \"Optimizing the Pain Portfolio,\" again highlighting how Purdue had \"[h]elped pass [the] nation's pro- ADF law in Massachusetts.\"928 Timney repea tedly trumpeted this legislative change (as he did in May and August) because it encouraged the sale of Purdue's opioids in Massachusetts. 771. After receipt of the proposed budget, Mortimer Sackler wrote to Timney saying \"Not a pretty picture. Is that really the best we can do next year?\" Timney tried to temper Mortimer's fears by assuring him \"everything within control of the team is improving.\" 929 924 08-11 email email from 243 772. In November , Timney sent his congratulations to the regulatory team upon FDA approval of Hysingla ER, Purdue's ne west opioid which came in strengths of up to 120 milligrams. 930 773. In February 2015, Timney gave an internal presentation about Purdue's strategy for continuing to profit from the sale of opioids.931 Timney acknowledged that the abuse deterrent properties of OxyContin do \"not address overconsumption\" orally \u2014 i.e., the most common mode of abuse \u2014and that \"abusers are likely to find a way around the ADP technology.\"932 At the same time, Timney directed Purdue's sales reps to promote OxyContin's abuse deterrent properties \u2014without disclosing these critical facts. 774. In late November , Timney r eported to the Board that authorities were increasing efforts to restrict access to opioids and noted concern over potential legislation in Massachusetts. Still, Timney told the Board that Purdue's sales visits and market share were increasing, and the 2016 strategy sought to \"expand[] the Sales Force,\" \"protect OxyContin against competition and grow Butrans & Hysingla ER.\"933 775. In January 2016, Timney attended the national sales meeting with hundreds of Purdue sales reps, including those from Massachusetts.934 776. In March, Timney received an email from a mother whose daughter was in treatment for opioid addiction. The mother asked Purdue to fund a recovery treatment center. Timney forwarded the email to his colleagues and the mother received a form letter in re sponse, 930 2014-11-20 email from 3, PPLPC011000014785 . 933 2015- 11-30 2016 Budget Presentation, slide 934 2016- 01-08 email from Eric Kizior, PPLP003569274. 244 listing various things Purdue had done to \"help solve\" the opioid crisis. 935 777. In April, as public pressure against opioids grew, Timney sent an email to staff titled, \"Urgency and Intensity.\" Expressing serious concern about the future of the busine ss, Timney demanded staff calculate Purdue's potential losses, develop strategies to mitigate them, and focus on improving the effectiveness of the sales force.936 778. In September , Purdue received .\" Rather than Purdue .\" Timney be .\"937 Timney's focus continued to be . 779. By November, Timney was executing this strategy of humanizing Purdue. He wrote a letter to the editor of the Boston Globe commenting on an article written about Purdue. Rather than taking responsibility for Purdue's role in fueling the opioid crisis, Timney asserted that, \"the Globe should recognize the impactful efforts companies like Purdue have taken to address the opioid epidemic.\" 938 780. Later that month, Timney gave an internal presentation demonstrating the inadequacies of Purdue's \"system\" for tracking prescribers that were prescribing opioids inappropriately. The presentation made clear that as late as 2016, Purdue's Abuse and Diversion 935 2016- 03-22 email from a mother to Mark Timney, PPLPC017000696223. 04-15 Mark 245 Detection system consisted of ad hoc , manual reviews of sales reps' call notes, media reports, internet searches, and prescribing records to identify opioid abuse and adverse events. Purdue had no system capable of providing meaningful deterrence, a full nine years after the 2007 convictions and settlement required one.939 781. In January 2017, Timney sent staff member David Haddox to Massachusetts to attend a closed -door meeting on the opioid crisis at Tufts.940 782. In advance of a meeting with Jonathan Sackler and a United States Senator, Timney suggested, \"this is a good time to tell the story about setting the new standard, and the future of Purdue.\"941 Timn ey and Jonathan were eager to deflect from their role in the creation of the opioid crisis and build alliances with powerful people who could protect them. 783. Timney monitored opioid -related developments in Massachusetts and around the country. In February, staff alerted Timney that Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker had attended a White House event about the opioid epidemic.942 784. Timney continued his public relations campaign to make the public believe Purdue was trying to fight the crisis. In April, staff reported to Timney that Purdue had contacted the CDC, following the issuance of the new CDC guidelines, listing Purdue's efforts to educate prescribers.943 Purdue did not tell t he CDC that Purdue's sales reps were continuing to target prescribers and push them to prescribe Purdue's opioids. 785. In April, the executive in charge of sales and marketing (who had replaced Russell Gasdia) resigned. Timney notified every employee at Purdue that he would eliminate the 939 2016- 11-09 Executive Committee pre-read, slide 34 email from Gail Cawkwell, PPLPC011000141097 . 246 middleman and communicate directives to the Sales and Marketing teams himself: \"I will assume responsibility for our Sales, Marketing, New Product Planning and OTC [over -the- counter] functions.\"944 786. In May , Timney reviewed a report from an independent non- profit organization on the effectiveness of abuse deterrent opioids that concluded the benefit of abuse deterrent formulations was \"inconclusive.\" He directed staff to react, and staff scrambled to institute a \"robust action plan\" to deal with the fallout.945 787. In June , Timney resigned from Purdue.946 788. Timney has collected substantial revenue from the sale of Purdue opioids in Massachusetts, as detailed in Exhibit 2 . 789. Timney's personal wealth came at immense cost to others. While Timney was Purdue's chief executive, more than 350 Massachusetts patients died of opioid -related overdoses after being prescribed Purdue opioids. PPLPC024001006343. 247 CRAIG LANDAU 790. Craig Landau has been selling Purdue opioids for nearly twenty years . He joined Purdue in 1999, was Chief Medical Officer from 2007 to 2013, and has been CEO since 2017. Landau participated in and directed a significant part of Purdue's misconduct from the 2007 convictions until today. 791. In each of his positions, Landau worked to get more M assachusetts patients on opioids at higher doses for longer periods of time. As Chief Medical Officer , he helped to develop the sales strategy and materials and instruct reps in how to sell Purdue's drugs . As CEO, he oversaw the whole sales scheme. 792. As Ch ief Medical Officer, Landau received each Board report regarding Purdue's misconduct in 2007 through 2011, and the reports sent in April and November 2012.947 As CEO, Landau himself reported directly to the Board. 793. Landau repeatedly targeted Massachusetts. As detailed below, he analyzed and reported on a study of doctor -shopping in Massachusetts. He promoted opioids at public and private meetings in Massachusetts. He promoted opioids through a grant to a Massachus etts hospital and in correspondence to a Massachusetts university. He tracked Massachusetts opioid legislation to protect Purdue's sales. 947 2007- 07-15 PDD8901724456; 2008 -07-15 PPLP004367297; 2009 report, ; 2010- 02-1 Board report, PPLPC012000252797 ; 2010 -04-21 report, PWG000423141; 2010 -07-27 Board report, PWG000422495; 2010 -10-25 Board report, 2011 -01-24 email 11-01 Board report, PWG000414933. 248 794. In September 2007, Landau directed a staff member to visit Boston for a conference on opioid risk management.948 795. He also worked with Sales VP Russell Gasdia on training for new hires about how to sell OxyContin.949 796. In January 2008, Landau addressed the entire sales force at the National Sales Meeting. He explained that he put a commercial representative on every research team, to orient research in ways that will sell more opioids.950 He was a guest at a table full of sales reps, and expressed that he was \"pumped\" for the meeting.951 797. In January 2009, Landau attended the National Sales Meeting again, and once again sa t with a table full of sales reps.952 He addressed the entire national team and emphasized that R&D depended on the sales force to sell its products to physicians.953 798. In March , Landau inked a deal with Massachusetts- based Analgesic Research for the company and its principal\u2014 a Massachusetts doctor \u2014to analyze documents, draft and edit submissions, and engage in related meetings and teleconferences for Purdue's New Drug Application for Butrans to the FDA.954 799. Later that month, Landau informed a staff member that he was working with Massachusetts opioid maker Collegium Pharmaceuticals on a strategy to position extended - release and long -acting opioids as safer than immediate release opioids.955 948 2007- email from Craig Landau, PPLPC013000167104 from Craig Landau, PPLPC012000154114 . 950 2007- 12-29 script for speech by Craig Landau, National Sales Meeting , PPLPC012000164977. 951 2008- 01-02 email from Craig Landau, from Craig from Russell Gasdia, PPLPC012000208460 ; 2009- 01-09 speech by Craig Landau, National Sales Meeting, PPLPC012000208461 . 954 2009- 03-03 Statement of Work #2 signed by Craig Landau and Nathaniel Katz , PPLPC002000042402- 403. 955 2009- 03-06 email from Craig Landau, PPLPC020000230433 . 249 800. In June, Landau . .956 As Landau knew at all relevant times, controlled o r extended release opioids do not substantially control pain better than lower- dose, immediate release opioids. Rather, steering patients to high-dose OxyContin was a key part of Purdue's deceptive marketing strategy. 801. Landau knew there was a high rate of oxycodone misuse in Massachusetts. Indeed, in April 2010, Landau edited and approved a presentation to the Board showing that the rate of \"doctor shopping\" in Massachusetts was far higher for oxycodone products than for other opioids. He reiterated this information in August. 957 802. In October, Landau received reports from internet chat rooms where abusers shared how to defeat OxyContin's new formulation. Landau passed this information on to John Stewart and Russell Gasdia.958 803. In January 2011, La ndau drafted goals and objectives for the new year that included supporting approval of OxyContin for children.959 In Massachusetts, one Purdue patient was given OxyContin for months starting at age 14, and died at age 21.960 956 2009- 06 emails from Pasha Sarrai, Craig Landau, and Laura Nelson Carney, PDD8901645846. 957 04-29 email from Craig Craig Landau, PPLPC013000286366; -01-05 Draft Objectives by Craig Landau , PPLPC013000286367 . 960 Another child in Massachusetts was prescribed OxyContin at 16 and died when he was 18 years old. 250 804. Landau worked as part of the team that created In the Face of Pain, a marketing campaign which deceived doctors and patients by presenting misleading prescriber testimonials about the use of opioids to treat pain.961 805. Later that month, Landau .962 806. In February, Landau sent his recommendations for the 10-year plan to John Stewart.963 Landau suggested Stewart include action items focused o n convincing more prescribers to treat pain in their practices. In his recommendation, Landau noted that the new formulation had no benefit to patients, but still told Stewart that Purdue would profit from a \"balloon effect\" where prescribers would switch patients away from non-abuse- deterrent formulations. 964 Landau knew and intended that Purdue would trick doctors and patients into believing the new formulation was less addictive. 807. In March , Landau approved a plan to send sales reps to the Military Healthc are Convention & Conference to promote Purdue's opioids as part of Purdue's strategy to target vulnerable patient population such as veterans. 965 808. In June, Landau .966 809. In July, Landau emailed a staff member, flagging \"publications calling into 961 2011- 01-21 Corporat e Reputation & Visibility strategic plan, pgs. 4, 26, PWG000387272 , -275, -297.

These publications were funded, in part, by Purdue, and Landau wanted to make sure they in turn were supporting Purdue's opioids.967 810. Landau knew by 2011 that many experts considered opioids unsafe for long durations of use, and discussed the fact that one of Purdue's paid Key Opinion Leaders , Russell Portenoy, had recently admitted it.968 811. In June 2012, Landau traveled to Massachusetts to attend the International Conference on Opioids.969 812. In February 2013, Landau signed another contract with Massachusetts- based Analgesic Research to work on Purdue's Hysingla opioid.970 813. In March, Landau compiled a meta- analysis of studies of chronic opioid use, writing that most studies showed only \"mild to moderate improvement\" in function, that some studies suggest ed that \"long- term opioid therapy is associated with negative outcomes,\" and noting that there is a \"critical need for additional studies to determine the long -term safety and efficacy of chronic opioid therapy for durations longer than 1 year.\"971 814. In June , Landau was a co -presenter at the International Conference on Opioids in Boston, Massachusetts.972 He presented on long- term use of opioids for chronic non- cancer pain \u2014 exactly what led so many Massachusetts patients to addiction, overdose, and death. 815. From 2013 to 2017, Landau was the CEO of Purdue Pharma Canada. 967 2011- 07-11 email from Craig La ndau, . 971 2013- 03-18 Systematic Review of the Efficacy and Safety of Long -Term Opioid Therapy in the Management of Chronic Noncancer Pain , PDD8013708195. 972 2013- 03-18 Scientific Communications Document Review Form, PPLP003878021. 252 816. In the summer of 2017, Landau returned to the United States as CEO of Purdue Pharma L.P. and Purdue P harma Inc. 817. , Landau wrote .\" He started . The family .\"973 818. Landau . \" .\" He admitted that Purdue Landau wrote: the Sacklers.974 819. Landau proposed .\" Purdue would .975 820. With Landau as CEO, Purdue's misconduct in Massachusetts continued. While Landau was the chief executive, Purdue sales reps visited Massachusetts prescribers more than 5,000 times. Now it was Landau who ensured that the sale s staff met their targets for prescriber visits and opioid sales. Now it was Landau who made misleading statements to defend Purdue 973 2017- 05-02 email from Craig Landau, PPLPC020001106305 ; 2017 by Craig Landau, PPLPC020001106306 . 974 2017- Presentation by Craig Landau, PPLPC020001106307- 308. 975 2017- 05-02 Presentation by Craig Landau, PPLPC020001106313. 253 against its critics. Now it was Landau who tried to please the Sacklers with plans to expand their opioid business even mo re. 821. In August, Landau edited Purdue's contribution to the Biotechnology Innovation Organization's Opioid Working Group. In it, Landau continued to push the deceptive idea that so-called \"abuse deterrent\" opioids are safe.976 In fact, abuse deterrent opioid s have no effect on the most common form of abuse: swallowing pills. 822. In September , Landau held a series of meeting s with staff about opioid promotion by Purdue's sales reps.977 823. In October , Landau instructed staff to investigate deceptive promotion of opioids by Purdue's Massachusetts- based competitor, Collegium.978 He asked about Collegium sales reps doing what Purdue had done for decades: visiting doctors to make false claims that their product was safer than other opioids. Then Landau directed staff to draft a letter for him to send to insurers accusing other opioid companies of misconduct to distract from Purdue's.979 824. In November , Landau wrote to the President of Tufts University, long -time recipient of the Sacklers' payments, to rebut \"recent news cov erage of the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma.\" In his letter, Landau falsely claimed that Purdue's misconduct ended \"sixteen years ago,\" and Purdue had \"worked tirelessly\" since then to disclose the risks of its drugs. In fact, Landau and others at Purdue worked to conceal the risks \u2014 getting more patients on higher doses for longer periods, without disclosing that patients on high doses are likely to stay on opioids longer and overdose and die. Landau wrote to Tufts that Purdue \"encourage[d] 976 2017- 08-31 email from Craig Landau , Opioid Mission, PPLPC001000259761. Craig Landau, PPLPC016000315550. 978 10-11 email from Craig Landau, PPLPC005000263817. 979 2017- 10-20 email from Craig Landau, PPLPC016000318811 . 254 physicians to prescribe fewer opioids.\"980 That same month, in the privacy of face -to-face sales visits, Purdue sales reps kept pushing Massachusetts doctors to prescribe more opioids, just as they had all along. And Purdue, under Landau as CEO, continued to evaluat e sales reps based on how much they increased opioid sales.981 825. A week after Landau wrote to Tufts that Purdue wanted fewer people on opioids, Jonathan Sackler suggested to Landau that Purdue launch yet another opioid to expand the market. Landau replied tha t he was already working on it and promised to present a proposal to the Sacklers within two weeks.982 826. In December , Landau took out an ad in major newspapers, including USA Today , The Wall Street Journal , and The New York Times. Landau knew and intended tha t the ad would reach tens of thousands of Massachusetts subscribers. In the ad, Landau emphasized the so - called abuse deterrent properties of Purdue's drugs, without disclosing that they provide no protection against the most common form of abuse \u2014 simply swallowing the pills.983 827. In January 2018, staff alerted Landau to a recent publication by the FDA showing that \"multiple studies clearly indicate an increasing risk of serious adverse health outcomes associated with increasing opioid analgesic dose.\" Lan dau was not surprised, because his own analysis five years earlier \u2014 in 2013 \u2014 showed the same thing.984 Nonetheless, for years after Landau wrote that analysis, he pushed higher doses to make more money. 980 2017- 11-13 letter from Craig Landau, PPLPC021000912689. 981 Exhibit 1. 982 2017- 11-21 emails from Jonathan Sackler and Craig Landau, PPLPC016000321333 , -334. 983 2017- 12-14 em ail from Craig PPLPC001000264824, -826-827. 2018 -01-25 email from Craig Landau, PPLPC002000292391 ; 2013- 03-18 Systematic Review of the Efficacy and Safety of Long- Term Opioid Therapy in the Management of Chronic Noncancer Pain , PDD8013708195 . 255 828. In February, , Landau laid off 300 sales reps. The next month he laid off another 125 Purdue employees.985 He kept his job and his salary. 829. Since the 2007 Judgment, Landau has collected substantial revenue from the sale of Purdue opioids in Massachusetts, as detailed in Exhibit 2. 830. While Landau was CEO, at least 51 Massachusetts patients who had been prescribed Purdue opioids overdosed and died. 9852018 -02-07 email from Craig Landau, PPLPC016000325614 ; 2018-03-14 email from Craig Landau, PPLPC020001163155. 256 Conclusion 831. Holding the defendants accountab le is important because of the people they hurt in Massachusetts and because of t he defendants' selfish, delibe rate choice to break the law. Purdue's leaders knew more than anyone about their addictive dr ugs. They knew how to get people addicted, how to keep peopl e addicted, and how to collec t the most money from the patients who were trapped on their opioids. They used the powe rs of a billion-dollar corporation to engineer an opioid epidemic. 832. As Purdue's scheme unraveled, in the fall of 2017, Purdue CEO L andau wrote down notes about the opioid crisis. He wrote: \"There are: Too many Rxs being written Too high a dose For too long For conditions that often don't require them By doctors who lack the requisite training in how to use them appropriately.\" 986 833. Craig Landau knew he was building a n epidemic the whole time. He joined Purdue in 1999. He helped make OxyContin a billion-dollar drug . His life's work is getting too many people on opioids, at doses t hat are too high, for far too long. 834. The opioid epidemic is not a mys tery to the people who started it. The defendants knew what they were doing. 986 2017-09-18 email from Craig Landau, PPLPC021000904935. 257 XI. DISCOVERY RULE AND TOLLING 835. The defendants' unfair and deceptive conduct continued from this Court's 2007 Judgment through 2018. 836. The defendants' unfair and deceptive conduct was well concealed. The defendants deliberately conducted much of their deception through in- person sales visits, in order to avoid a potentially discoverable paper trail. Purdue prohibited its sales reps from emailing doctors. After this Office notified Purdue of our investigation, Purdue changed its decade- old procedure so that sales reps would not write down descriptions of their conversations with doctors for every sales visit, even in Purdue's internal records. The defendants conc ealed from the public and from the Commonwealth their internal documents about their deceptive scheme, including their plans to hook more patients on higher doses for longer periods; their findings that higher doses were a way to hook patients onto treatme nt for longer periods; and their knowledge of inappropriate prescribing by high- prescribing doctors that they targeted to prescribe their drugs. The individual defendants further concealed their participation in the deception and did not reveal to the Com monwealth the fact that they were directing and profiting from the deceptive scheme. 837. Discover ing the nature and extent of the defendants' unfair and deceptive conduct required a costly and complex investigation. As part of the investigation, t he Attorney General's Office has collected more than a million pages of evidence regarding the defendants' deception. 838. Because of the defendants' deception, any statutes of limitation otherwise applicable to any claims asserted herein against all defendants have been t olled by the discovery rule and rules regarding fraudulent concealment. 839. In addition to the tolling provided by common law, Purdue Pharma Inc., Purdue Pharma L.P., and the Commonwealth entered into a written agreement tolling any applicable 258 statutes of limi tation during the period from August 3, 2016 through May 18, 2018. XII. JURISDICTION AND VEN UE 840. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this suit pursuant to General Laws chapter 93A section 4 and chapter 214 section 1. General Jurisdiction Under M.G.L. Chapter 223A \u00a7 2 841. The Court has general jurisdiction over Russell Gasdia pursuant to General Laws chapter 223A section 2. Specific Jurisdiction Under M.G.L. Chapter 223A \u00a7 3(a) 842. The Court has specific jurisdiction over all defendants pursuant to General Laws chapter 223A section 3(a), because this action arises from each defendant acting directly and through agents to transact business in Massachusetts. 843. In the 2007 Judgment entered in civil action no. 07- 1967, Purdue Pharma I nc. and Purdue Pharma L.P. admitted the jurisdiction of this Court. 844. Purdue Pharma Inc. is incorporated with its official purpose as manufacture, sales, distribution, and research and development with respect to pharmaceutical, toiletry, chemical and cosmet ic products , directly or as the general partner of a partnership e ngaged in those activities. It controls Purdue Pharma L.P. and transacts business in Massachusetts, under section 3(a) of the Massachusetts Long -Arm Statute, M.G.L. c. 223A, \u00a73, both on its own and through Purdue Pharma L.P. 845. Purdue Pharma L.P. employed scores of sales reps in Massachusetts to promote Purdue's opioids in Massachusetts and sold more than $500,000,000 of opioids in Massachusetts. 846. Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler, Ilene Sackler Lefcourt, Jonathan Sackler, Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler, Theresa Sackler, Peter Boer, Judith Lewent, 259 Cecil Pickett, Paulo Costa, Ralph Snyderman, John Stewart, Russell Gasdia, Mark Timney, and Craig Landau voted for and/or ordered sales reps to go door -to-door, making thousands of visits to doctors in Massachusetts to implement the deceptive scheme described in this Complaint. 847. Despite being warned in writing that it was a high -risk activity, Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler, Ilene Sackler Lefcourt, Jonathan Sackler, Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler, Theresa Sackler , Peter Boer, Judith Lewent, Cecil Pickett, Paulo Costa, Ralph Snyderman, John Stewart, Russell Gasdia, Mark Timney, and Craig Landau directed payments to Massachusetts doctors such as Walter Jacobs in exchange for the doctors' promotion of Purdue drugs. 848. Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler, Ilene Sackler Lefcourt, Jonathan Sackler, Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler, Theresa Sackler , Peter Boer, Judit h Lewent, Cecil Pickett, Snyderman, John Stewart, Russell Gasdia, Mark Timney, and Craig Landau directed and/or managed efforts to advance favorable legislation and block unfavorable lawmaking in Massachusetts that would impact Purdue's sales in the Commonwealth. These individuals knew and intended that Massachusetts was an important market for Purdue's dangerous drugs. 849. Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler, Ilene Sackler Lefcourt, Jonathan Sackler, Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler, Theresa Sackler , Peter Boer, Judith Lewent, Cecil Pickett, Paulo Costa, Ralph Snyderman, John Stewart, Russell Gasdia, Mark Timney, and Craig Landau directed the dissemination of tens of thousands of copies of unfair or deceptive marketing materials to health care providers throughout the Commonwealth to get more and more patients on Purdue's drugs for longer and longer periods of time at high and high er doses. Although they did not lick the stamps themselves, these individuals directed and/or managed a 260 chain -of-command causing these mailings in Massachusetts because they meant increased sales and profits for the Sacklers and their executives. 850. Through targeted funding and programming, Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler, Ilene Sackler Lefcourt, Jonathan Sackler, Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler, Theresa Sackler , Peter Boer, Judith Lewent, Cecil Pickett, Paulo Costa, Ralph Snyderman, John Stewart, Russell Gasdia, Mark Timney, and Craig Landau unfairly and deceptively promoted opioids at Massachusetts medical institutions including Tufts University and Massachusetts General Hospital. Their votes for and /or management of funding and programming at these institutions encouraged more no- or limited -access doctors to prescribe Purdue's dangerous drugs at higher doses for longer periods a nd made the Sacklers and their executives more money. 851. John Stewart traveled to Boston to network with and influence MGH doctors who could prescribe opioids in Massachusetts. Craig Landau signed multiple work orders with a Massachusetts- based consultant for work related to the approval for sale of Purdue's dangerous drugs, presented on opioids for chronic pain at the International Conference on Opioids in Boston, and offered to meet with Tufts' President in person to maintain the business advantages that relationship provided. Russell Gasdia traveled throughout Massachusetts to promote Purdue's opioids, including at conferences, trade shows, and district sales meetings. Richard Sackler had a Tufts professor meet with Purdue staff. Specific Jurisdiction Under M.G.L. Chapter 223A \u00a7 3(c ) 852. The Court also has specific jurisdiction over all defendants pursuant to G eneral Laws chapter 223A section 3(c), because this action arises f rom each defendant acting directly and through agents to cause tortious injury by act s and omissions in Massachusetts. 853. Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler , Ilene Sackler Lefcour t, 261 Jonathan Sackler , Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler, Theresa Sackler, Peter Boer, Judith Lewent, Cecil Pickett, Paulo Costa, Ralph Snyderman, John Stewart, Russell Gasdia, Mark Timney, and Craig Landau directed sales reps to go door -to-door, making thousa nds of visits to doctors in Massachusetts. Although they did not knock on the doors to clinics and family practices themselves, these individuals voted for and/or ordered sales reps to deceptively promote Purdue's dangerous drugs in person, as a central f acet of their deceptive marketing scheme that killed hundreds of people in Massachusetts. 854. Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler , Ilene Sackler Lefcourt , Jonathan Sackler , Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler, Theresa Sackler, Peter Boer, Judith Lewent , Cecil Pickett, Paulo Costa, Ralph Snyderman, John Stewart, Russell Gasdia, Mark Timney, and Craig Landau voted for and/or directed payments to Massachusetts doctors to promote Purdue's drugs. 855. Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler , Ilene Sackler Lefcourt , Jonathan Sackler , Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler, Theresa Sackler, Peter Boer, Judith Lewent, Cecil Pickett, Paulo Costa, Ralph Snyderman, John Stewart, Russell Gasdia, Mark Timney, and Craig Landau voted for, directed, and/or managed unfair and deceptive efforts to advance favorable legislation and block unfavorable lawmaking in Massachusetts that would impact Purdue's sales in the Commonwealth. These individuals knew and intended that Massachusetts was an important market for Purdue's dangerous drugs. 856. Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler , Ilene Sackler Lefcourt , Jonathan Sackler , Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler, Theresa Sackler, Peter Boer, Judith Lewent, Cecil Pickett, Paulo Costa, Ralph Snyderman, John Stewart, Russell Gasdia, Mark Timney, and Craig Landau all directed the dissemination of tens of thousands of copies of unfair or deceptive 262 marketing materials to doctors and other health care providers throughout the Commonwealth for the purpose of getting more and more prescribers to put their patients on Purdue's drugs for longer and longer periods of time at high and higher doses. These individuals voted for and/or managed a chain -of-command causing these mailings in Massachusetts because they meant increased sales and profits for the Sacklers and their executives. 857. By ordering and/or managing targeted funding and programming, Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler , Ilene Sackler Lefcourt , Jonathan Sackler , Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler , Theresa Sackler, Pet er Boer, Judith Lewent, Cecil Pickett, Paulo Costa, Ralph Snyderman, John Stewart, Russell Gasdia, Mark Timney, and Craig Landau unfairly and deceptively promoted opioids at Massachusetts medical institutions including Tufts University and Massachusetts General Hospital. These individuals got more and more no- or limited -access doctors to prescribe Purdue's dangerous drugs at higher and higher doses for longer and longer periods of time and made the Sacklers and their executives more and more money. 858. In addition, Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, Ilene Sackler Lefcourt , Jonathan Sackler , Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler , and Theresa Sackler (directors in 2007) voted for and caused Purdue Pharma L.P. to enter into a Settlement Agreement with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to address Purdue's liability from the last time it deceived doctors and patients about its opioids. 859. In addition, Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, Ilene Sackler Lefcourt , Jonathan Sackler , Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler , and Theresa Sackler (directors in 2007) voted for and caused Purdue Pharma Inc. and Purdue Pharma L.P. to enter into the 2007 Judgment issued by this Court, which required that: (a) Purdue not deceive doctors and patients about its opioids; and 263 (b) when Purdue found evidence of improper prescribing by its target doctors, Purdue stop promoting opioids and contact the authorities. 860. Subsequently, as described in this Complaint, Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler , Ilene Sackler Lefcourt , Jonathan Sackler , Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler , Theresa Sackler, Peter Boer, Judith Lewent, Cecil Pickett, Paulo Costa, Ralph Snyderman, John Stewart, Russell Gasdia, Mark Timney, and Craig Landau directed or caused Purdue to violate the 2007 Judgment of this Court. 861. This misconduct caused tortious injury in Massachusetts by killing hundreds of people and injuring many more . Specific Jurisdiction Under M.G.L. Chapter 223A \u00a7 3(d) 862. The Court also has specific jurisdiction over all defendants pursuant to General Laws chapte r 223A section 3(d), because: This acti on arises from each defendant acting directly and through agents to cause tortious injury in Massachusetts by act s and omission outside Massachusetts; and Each defendant also regularly does or solicits business in Massachusetts, or engages in other persistent courses of conduct in Massachusetts, or derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or services rendered in Massachusetts. This action arises from each defend ant causing tortious injury in Massachusetts 863. The first element of the section 3(d) jurisdictional test is satisfied for every individual defendant because this action arises from Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler , Ilene Sackler Lefcourt , Jonatha n Sackler , Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler , Theresa Sackler, Peter Boer, Judith Lewent, Cecil Pickett, Paulo Costa, Ralph Snyderman, John Stewart, Russell Gasdia, Mark Timney, and Craig Landau causing tortious injury in Massachusetts. As described in this Complaint, each individual defendant voted for, directed, and/or managed 264 Purdue's misconduct, which killed hundreds of people in Massachusetts. Each defendant derives substantial revenue from goods used in Massachusetts 864. The second element of the section 3 (d) jurisdictional test is also satisfied for every individual defendant because each defendant derived substantial revenue from goods used or consumed in Massachusetts. Indeed, the defendants acquired the revenue through their tortious misconduct. 865. Purdue Pharma L.P. and Purdue Pharma Inc. collected approximately 2.8% of their revenue from Massachusetts. The Sacklers, as well as Peter Boer, Judith Lewent, Cecil Pickett, Paulo Costa, Ralph Snyderman, John Stewart, Russell Gasdia, Mark Timney, and Craig Landau, tracked this revenue as it came in to Purdue from the Commonwealth. The defendants made no effort to segregate Massachusetts revenue, or withhold it from money they directed Purdue to pay them. Instead, the defendants included Massachusetts revenue in payments to all of Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler , Ilene Sackler Lefcourt , Jonathan Sackler , Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler , Theresa Sackler , Peter Boer, Judith Lewent, Cecil Pickett, Costa, Ralph Snyderman, John Stewart, Russell Gasdia, Mark Timney, and Craig Landau. 265 866. Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler , Ilene Sackler Lefcourt , Jonathan Sackler, Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler, and Theresa Sackler paid their families billions of dollars from opioid sales, including approximately $ from Massachusetts from 2007 to the present. This list of payments is likely incomplete and not exhaustive. Sackler Defendants Revenue From Massachusetts Date Payments MA Share Total 867. The directors paid themselves handsomely for their positions on the Board. Mr. Snyderman reported to the government some of what Purdue paid him. Purdue paid him at least $32,972 for a few months of 2013; $166,119 in 2014; $168,887 in 2015; and $124,360 in 2016. 868. Each director defendant was on the board for at least five years (and in many cases for twenty years). In exchange for sitting on the board, Purdue paid each director defendant more than $ , including approximately $ from 266 Massachusetts. 869. John Stewart has collected substantial revenue from the sale of Purdue opioids in Massachusetts, as detailed in Exhibit 2 . 870. Russell Gasdia has collected of dollars from Purdue since the 2007 Judgment, including dollars from the sale of Purdue opioids in Massachusetts. 871. Mark Timney has collected substantial revenue from the sale of Purdue opioids in Massachusetts, as detailed in Exhibit 2 . 872. Craig Landau has collected substantial revenue from t he sale of Purdue opioids in Massachusetts, as detailed in Exhibit 2. Many defendants also do regular business and engage in a persistent course of conduct in Massachusetts 873. In addition, the disjunctive second element of the section 3(d) jurisdictional test is independently satisfied for many defendants because they regularly do business or engage in a persistent course of conduct in Massachusetts, through agents and instrumentalities as described above, and in person as described below. Due Process 874. Jurisdiction over all defendants is also proper under the Due Process Clause. Constitutional due process requires that : 1) the defendants purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting activities in Massachusetts or purposefully directed their conduct into Massachusetts; 2) the P laintiff's claim relate s to or arise s out of the defendants' contact with Massachusetts; and 3) the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable. Each of those requirements is satisfied. 875. The exercise of jurisdiction over each of the individual defendants i s reasonable 267 because the burden on each defendant to defend suit in Massachusetts is minimal while the interests of the Commonwealth in adjudicating the dispute in this forum are significant. 876. The Commonwealth has a compelling interest in adjudicating this dispute and obtaining relief for its citizens. The Commonwealth has, since declared by then Governor Deval Patrick in 2014, been operating under a state of a public health emergency due to an epidemic of opioid addiction and death. As the Commonwealth' s lawyer and chief law enforcement officer, the Attorney General has an interest in protecting the people of Massachusetts. 877. All the individual defendants are at least millionaires and, in some cases, billionaires, and they can afford to travel to the Commonwealth to defend this lawsuit. 878. All the individual defendants are represented by sophisticated counsel in a state abutting Massachusetts. Their counsel routinely litigate throughout the United States. 879. Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler , Ilene Sackler Lefcourt , Jonathan Sackler , Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler, Theresa Sackler , Paulo Costa, Russell Gasdia, Mark Timney, and Craig Landau all live in or retain a primary or secondary residence in states abutting Massachusetts. 880. Richard Sackler has served on the Board of Advisors of a major medical school and a school of graduate biomedical sciences in Massachusetts during every year from 2011 to the present. He regularly visited Massachusetts to transact business and make decisions for schools with thousands of Massachusetts employees. Richard was also an advisor to a research institute at another major university in Massachusetts, at least from 2012 to 2015, and visited Massachusetts to advise work there.

On information and belief, David Sackler regularly transacts business in Massachu setts in connection with the fund, and visits Massachusetts for meetings related to the fund. 883. Jonathan Sackler served, from 2004 until at least 2014, as a director and President of the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Foundation, Inc., which registered to do business in Massachusetts. Each year, he signed the annual reports of the corporation, submitted to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, describing the corporation's business in Massachusetts. 884. Mortimer Sackler lived in Massachusetts at least during the period from 1991 through 1999. He owned a condominium at 950 Massachusetts Ave. , Unit PH2, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02139. 885. Judith Lewent is as a lifetime member of the governing board of a major university in Massachusetts; attends meetings in Massachusetts at least 4 times each year; and makes decisions for one of the most significant employers in our state. She became a member of that governing board in 1994; she has served on its Executive Committee and chaired the Visiting Committee of the university's Sch ool of Management. She is also currently a director of a significant company, which has been registered with the Massachusetts Secretary of State since 1960.

CAUSES OF ACTION COUNT ONE UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES IN VIOLATION OF G.L. c. 93A \u00a7 2 890. The Commonwealth realleges each allegation above . 891. G.L. c. 93A, \u00a7 4 authorizes the Attorney General to bring an action to enjoin a defendant from engaging in a method, act, or practice that violates G.L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2. 892. On May 8, 2018, the Attorney General notified Purdue Pharma Inc. and Purdue Pharma L.P. of her intention to file this suit and offered them an opportunity to confer, in conformance with G.L. c. 93A. 893. On June 1, 2018, the Attorney General notified Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler , Ilene Sackler Lefcourt , Jonathan Sackler , Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler , Theresa Sackler , Peter Boer, Judith Lewent, Cecil Costa, Ralph Snyderman, John Stewart, Mark Timney , and Craig Landau of her intention to file this suit and offered them an opportunity to confer, in conformance with G.L. c. 93A . 894. On November 28, 2018, the Attorney General notified Russell Gasdia of her intention to name him as a defendant in this Amended Complaint and offered an opportunity to confer, in conformance with G.L. c. 93A . 895. Through their conduct, including as described in this Complaint, i n the course of marketing and promoting its opioids in Massachusetts, both directly and through third parties whom the defendants knew were acting in Massachusetts, each defendant engaged in unfair and deceptive acts and practices in Massachusetts in the conduct of trade or commerce in violation of G.L. c. 93A, including by making false and misleading claims and failing to disclose material risks to get more patients on its opioids at higher doses for longer time, and to steer patien ts away from safer alterna tives . Through their unfair and deceptive conduct , the defendants 271 succeeded in getting many Massachusetts doctors to prescribe and Massachusetts patients to take and remain on Purdue opioids. 896. Each defendant also violated G.L. c. 93A by targeting medical practices where they knew or should have known that Purdue's opioids were prescribed dangerously and patients were harmed. 897. By means of their unfair and deceptive acts, the defendants collected hundreds of millions of dollars. 898. Because of the defendants' unfair and deceptive acts, the Commonwealth and its residents suffered ascertainable injuries and losses of billions of dollars. 899. Each defendant knew or should have known they were committing unfair and deceptive acts in violation of G.L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2. 900. Each unfair or deceptive act was a distinct violation of G.L. c. 93A. COUNT TWO PUBLIC NUISANCE 901. The Commonwealth realleges each allegation above. 902. Under Massachusetts common law, a defendant is liable for the tort of public nuisance when their conduct causes an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public, such as interference with the public health, public safety, public peace, and public comfort and convenience . 903. The Massachusetts Attorney General is empowered to bring a parens patriae action on behalf of the Commonwealth for abatement of a public nuisance . 904. Through their conduct , including as described in th is Complaint, each defendant was a substantial participant in creating and maintaining a public nuisance of addiction, illness, and death that significantly interferes with the public health, safety, peace, comfort, and 272 convenience . 905. Specifically, each defendant engaged in a campaign of deceptive marketing leading directly to a n epidemic of opioid addiction, which resulted in substantial public injuries . 906. The injuries that the defendants caused in Massachusetts have been significant and long- lasting , for both the C ommonwealth and the public, including: (a) opioid addiction, overdose, and death; (b) health care costs for individuals, children, families, employers, the Commonwealth , and its subdivisions; (c) loss of productivity and harm to the economy of the Commonwe alth; and (d) special public costs borne solely by the Commonwealth in its efforts to abate the nuisance and to support the public health, safety, and welfare . 907. The Commonwealth has spent at least hundreds of millions of dollars on special treatment, preven tion, intervention, and recovery initiatives to abate the harms of the opioid epidemic , including appropriating $134 FY $185.3 million in FY 2018, and more than $200 million in FY 2019. The Commonwealth intends to seek reimbursement from the defendants for its expenses abating the harms they caused . 908. The Commonwealth has a special relationship with, and responsibility to its residents, including its responsibility to uphold the public health, safety, and welfare. E ach defendant had reason to know of this relationship at all times . 909. Each defendant , at all times, had reason to know of the public nuisance created by their ongoing conduct. 910. The defendants' deceptive conduct was unreasonable in light of the lack of scienti fic support for their claims and was negligent and reckless with regard to the known risks of Purdue's drugs . 273 XIV. PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, the Commonwealth respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief after a trial on the merits: a.
