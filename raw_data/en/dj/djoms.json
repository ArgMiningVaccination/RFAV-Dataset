Those who follow a macrobiotic diet aim to eat in a way that promotes longevity and a healthy lifestyle. In holistic health and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), people who follow a macrobiotic diet believe it's in line with the 5,000-year-old philosophy of yin and yang. Yin represents expanding energy, while yang represents contracting energy. It's thought that these two energies are the foundations of many different things, including food groups and body types.
