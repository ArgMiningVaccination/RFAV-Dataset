Vol. 22-9PREFACE The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is an electronic-on ly, online monthly publication of the Office of the Administrative Rules Coordinator, Division of Financial Ma nagement, that is published pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a compilation of all official rule making notices, official rule text, executive orders of the Governor, and all legislative documents af fecting rules that are statutorily required to be published in the Bulletin. It may also include other rules-related documents an agency may want to make public through the Bulletin. State agencies are required to provide public notice of all rulemaking actions and must invite public input. This is done through negotiated rulemaking procedures or after proposed rulemaking has been initiated. The public receives notice that an agency has initiated proposed rulemaking procedures through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and a legal notice (Public Notice of Intent) that publishes in authorized newspapers throughout the state. The legal notice provides reasonable opportunity for the public to par ticipate when a proposed rule publishes in the Bulletin. Interested parties may submit written comments to the agency or request public hearings of the agency, if none have been scheduled. Such submissions or requests must be pr esented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the individual \"Notice of Rulemaking - Proposed Rule\" for each proposed rule that is published in the Bulletin. Once the comment period closes, the ag ency considers fully all comments and information submitted regarding the proposed rule. Changes may be made to the proposed rule at this stage of the rulemaking, but changes must be based on comments received and must be a \"logical outgrowt h\" of the proposed rule. The agency may now adopt and publish the pending rule. A pending rule is \"pending\" legislative review for final approval. The pending rule is the agency's final version of the rulemaking that will be forwarded to the legislature for review and final approval. Comment periods and public hearings are not provided for when the agency adopts a temporary or pending rule. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is identified by the calendar y ear and issue number. For example, Bulletin 19-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2019; Bulletin 20-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2020. Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, co rrespond to the months of publication, i.e.; V olume No. 19-1 refers to January 2019; V olume No. 20-2 refers to February 2020; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin published in January 2019 is cited as V olume 19-1. The December 2019 Bulletin is cited as V olume 19-12 . RELATIONSHIP TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is an electronic-only, online comp ilation of all final and enforceable administrative rules of the state of Idaho that are of full force and effect. Any temporary rule that is adopted by an agency and is of force and effect is codified into the Administrative Code upon Bulletin publication. All pending rules that have been approved by the legislature during the legislative session as final rules and any temporary rules that are extended supplement the Administrative Code. These rules are codified into the Administrative Code upon becoming effective. Because proposed and pending ru les are not enforceable, th ey are published in the Administrative Bulletin only and cannot be codified into the Administrative Code until approved as final. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect or whether any amendments have been made to the rule, refer to the Cumulative Rulemaking Index . Link to it on the Administrative Rules homepage at adminrules.idaho.gov . THE DIFFERENT RULES PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Idaho's administrative rulemaking process, governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, Title 67, Chapter 52, Idaho Code, comprises distinct rulemaking actions: negotiated, proposed, temporary, pending and final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings incorporate or require all of these actions. At a minimum, a rulemaking includes proposed, pending and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as temporary rules when they meet the required statutory criteria and agencies must, when feasible, engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate consensus building. In the majority of cases, the process begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with the final rulemaking. The following is a brief explanation of each type of rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 6 September 7, 2022 - Vol. 22-91. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interested persons and the agency seek consensus on the content of a rule through dialogue. Agencies are required to conduct negotiated rulemaking whenever it is feasible to do so. The agency files a \"Notice of Intent to Promulgate - Negotiated Rulemaking\" for publication in the Administrative Bulletin inviting interested persons to contact the agency if interested in discussing the agency's intentions regarding the rule changes. This process is intended to result in the formulation of a proposed rule and the initiation of regular rulemaking procedures. One result, however, may also be that regular (proposed) rulemaking is not initiated and no further action is taken by the agency. 2. PROPOSED RULEMAKINGA proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency wherein the agency is proposing to amend or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to th e adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency must publish a \"Notice of Rulemaking - Proposed Rule\" in the Bulletin. This notice must include very specific information regarding the rulemaking including all relevant state or federal statutory authority occasioning the rulemaking, a non-technical description of the changes being made, any associated cost s, guidance on how to participate through submission of written comments and requests for public hearings, and the text of the proposed rule in legislative format. 3. TEMPORARY RULEMAKIN G Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds that it is necessary for: a) protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs; or c) conferring a benefit. If a rulemaking meets one or more of these criteria, an d with the Governor's approval, the agency may adopt and make a temporary rule effective prior to receiving legislative authorization a nd without allowing for any public input. The law allows an agency to make a temporary rule immedi ately effective upon adoption. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular legislative sess ion unless the rule is extended by concurrent resolution, is replaced by a final rule, or expires under its own terms. 4. PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under regular rulemaking procedures and remains subject to legislative review before it becomes a final, en forceable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the \"Notice of Rulemaking - Pending Rule.\" This includes a statement giving the reasons for adopting the rule, a statement regarding when the rule becomes effective, a description of how it differs from the proposed rule, and identification of any fees being imposed or changed. Agencies are required to republish the text of the pendi ng rule when substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies in content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending rule change is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that me mbers of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of the pending rule. 5. FINAL RULEMAKINGA final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agen cy under the regular rulemaking procedures and is of full force and effect.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 7 September 7, 2022 - Vol. 22-9HOW TO USE THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Rulemaking documents produced by state agencies and published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin are organized by a numbering schematic. Each state agency ha s a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAPA\" Codes are listed in the alphab etical/numerical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or sections to which a tw o-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are \"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text is divided among major sections that are further subdivided into subsections. An example IDAPA number is as follows: IDAPA 38.05.01.200.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrative Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. \"38.\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration \"05.\" refers to Title 05, which is the Department of Administration's Division of Purchasing \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\" \"200.\" refers to Major Section 200, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\" \"02.\" refers to Subsection 200. 02. \"c.\" 200.02. c. \"ii.\" refers to Subsection 200.02.c. ii. DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule docketing system. Each rulemaking that is filed with the Coordinator is assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER.\" The docket number is a series of numbers separated by a hyphen (38-0501-1401). (the two-digit agency code) in the Bulletin. The following example is a breakdown of a typical rule docket number: \"DOCKET NO. 38-0501-1901\" \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule bein g promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05), Rules of the Division of Purchasing (Chapter 01). \"1901\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket being published; in this case the numbers refer to the first rulemaking action published in calendar year 2019. A subsequent rulemaking on this same rule chapter in calendar year 2019 would be designated as \" 1902\". The docket number in this scenario would be 38-0501- 1902 . Within each Docket, only th e affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections affected are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section \"200\" appears before Section \"345\" and so on). Whenever the sequence of the numbering is broken the following statement will appear: (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 8 September 7, 2022 -

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given this agency has adopted a temporary rule. The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 34-104, 36-105, and 36-408, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule: This temporary rule confers a benefit to outfitting businesses in Idaho, and supports implementation of statute, by providing a logical method for determining tag use history for 2023 tag allocation for outfitted hunters in general elk and deer hunts in which tags are limited for nonresidents and unlimited for residents. The Commission makes the 2023 outfitted hunter tag allocation before 2023 general hunt tags go on sale to nonresidents on December 1, 2022 to provide certainty for outfitting businesses marketing outfitted hunts to nonresidents. The purpose of this temporary rulemaking is to bridge the transition from outfitter reporting of client use of elk and deer tags through the Idaho Outfitters and Guides Licensing Board to a system of reporting through verification of tag sales recorded via the Idaho Department of Fish an d Game licensing system, consistent with 2020 amendments to Section 36-408, Idaho Code. The amended Section 36-408 au thorizes the Commission to allocate deer and elk tags for outfitted hunters based on the highest number of tag use in a two-year period. As of December 1, 2022, only one complete year (2021) of tag sales data will be recorded via the Department's licensing system. This temporary rule authorizes the Commission to determine 2023 tag allocation for general hunts limited only for nonresidents by considering the higher of the 2020 outfitted hunter use data reported to the Board and 2021 use data recorded via the Department's licensing system in accord ance with Section 36-408, Idaho Code. The proposed rule adopted concurrently with this temporary rule will authorize the Commission's consideration of two years of verified outfitted hunter tag use data, recorded via the Department's licensing system, in determining tag allocation in 2024 and subsequent years.TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226 (c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate because it confers a benefit (as described in the preceding section). FEE SUMMARY: Not applicable. This temporary rule does not impose new fees or charges.

FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: This rule change is budget neutral. There is no cost associated with adding MA-Cs as staff allowed to administer medications. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2)(b), Idaho Code, formal negotiated rulemaking was not conducted as this rule change is simple in nature and is being done at the request of the primary stakeholders. The content of this rulemaking is a result of informal negotiations conducted with stakeholders.INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the materials cited are being incorporated by reference into this rule: N/AASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on technical questions concerning the temporary and proposed rule, contact Laura Thompson, (208) 364-1874.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Sections SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than September 21, 2022. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explan ation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Idaho continues to experience increased cost of living. These changes provide for increased reimbursement to foster parents and address the increased cost in caring for a child in foster care. During the 2022 legislative session, the Division of Family and Community Services (FACS) requ ested an increase to the budg et to allow for an increase to the reimbursement to foster parents and to increase the reimbursement amount for youth age eighteen through twenty-one (18-21) in extended foster care. JFAC approved this request and utilized additional funds to make the increase effective April 1, 2022. The fund ing for this increased foster care reim bursement is included in appropriation bill H0773 (2022). Not updating this rule would leave foster parents with reimbursement rates out of alignment with approved budget and fees. Community members will be unable to care for children in foster care without having to use their own finances to do so. There would be a continued decline in the number of community members willing to provide foster care. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section(s) 67-5226(1) (c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: This confers a benefit to foster parents and foster childre n and the need to increase reimbursements to prevent the further decline of foster parents and their financial ability to participate in the Foster Parent Program. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: Funds are provided through State General Funds and fe deral Title IV-E and IV-B funds. The total increased spending associated with this change is $6,103,400 ($3,284,900 State General Fund and $2,818,500 Federal funds). These amounts were allocated by the 2022 Idaho Legislature for this purpose (H0733-2022). These funds will go directly to foster and adoptive families. The FACS case ma nagement system has been updated to generate the new rates, and there is no fiscal impact to the case management system change. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because these chan ges are simple in nature. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the materials cited are being incorporated by reference into this rule: N/ADEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WE LFARE Docket No. 16-0601-2201 Child and Family Services Temporary & Proposed Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 152 September 7, 2022 - Vol. 22-9ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on technical questions concerning the temporary and proposed rule, contact Julie Sevcik, 208-863-4229 and Michelle Weir, 208-334-5651.

The action is authorized pursuant to SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than September 21, 2022. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: In 2018 the Family First Act (Public Law (P.L.) 115-12 3), became effective allowing for the use of federal funds to prevent children at risk from entering foster care. Idaho is currently negotiating our five-year prevention plan that outlines the requirements that define when a family qualif ies for the use of these funds to prevent a qualifying child from entering foster care. Idaho contract requirements include that when multiple contracts will be issued for the same services that the rates must be published. Under Core Child and Family Servi ces, the prevention services and community support services will be combined to reflect the application of se rvices to prevent children at risk of entering foster care. The rule will further clarify for the purpose of entering into multiple statewide contracts the rates that have been set for statewide service provision and where those rates are located. This will provide clarity to prevention services and rates paid to private agencies by the department. If these rates are not promulgated, the Division of Family and Community Services (FACS) will be unable to implement multiple contracts for services across the state that have standard rates for the provision of services. Not having prevention service rates published statewide would lead to inconsistency in the rate of payment to private agencies who provide services. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: There will be an increase in Title IV-E federal funds to pay for prevention services currently covered by state general funds and other federal grants. Based on current us e of in-home parenting and intensive parent-child therapy this impact is expected to be less than $100,000 during the first 12 months of prevention services. Due to stand up time for services this cost will be significantly less in SFY 2023. Prevention Services will be eligible for Title IV-E funds at 50% of Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) through 2026 and then at the full FMAP rate. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because the proposed rule will provide guidance on how services rates are determined and where rates are located. These changes are simple in nature, needed to alig n with federal requirements, and to maintain consistency in rates of payment.

( ) 208. - 256. (RESERVED) 257. DESIGNATION OF ALLOCATED DEER AND ELK TAGS. For the purposes of this section, an outfitting operation is an outfitter licensee whose licensed activities include hunting for the species in the area of th e allocated tag being designated. When IFGC allocates tags, the allocated tags DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL AND PROFESSI ONAL LICENSES Docket No. 24-3501-2201 Rules of the Outfitters and Guides Licensing Board Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 225 September 7, 2022 - Vol. 22-9will be designated pursuant to Section 36-2120, Idaho Code, and this rule. The designation applies for the next season unless IFGC adjusts the number of allocat ed tags for the hunt. ( ) 01. Notification . All notices, orders, or other documents may be made to the email address on file with the Board. ( ) 02. Outfitted Hunter Tag Use History . Each outfitter's hunter tag use history will be determined from the use recorded by IFGC pursuant to Section 36-408(4), Idaho Code, and as may be adjusted as a result of a tag transfer or hardship request that is approved by the Board. ( ) a. Transfers. An outfitting operation is credited for use of an allocated tag that it transfers to another outfitting operation for use that year in the same hunt. The receiving outfitting operation is not credited for using the transferred tag. ( ) b. Surrenders. An outfitting operation may surrender a designated allocated tag(s) to the undesignated tag pool for use by any outfitting operation in the same hunt. The surrendering outfitting operation is not credited for use of the surrendered tag unless it later uses the tag from the pool. ( ) 03. New Hunt Allocated Tag Designation . When the IFGC allocates tags for a newly capped or controlled hunt, the allocated tags will be designated proportionately as follows: ( ) a. Divide each outfitting operation's base allocation by the total of all base allocations in the hunt, resulting in a percentage of total use. Truncate the decimal at the hundredths place. ( ) b. Multiply the percentage of total use from Subsection 257.03.a. of these rules by the total number of allocated tags for the hunt, which determines the number of allocated tags designated to the outfitting operation. ( ) 04. Use of Previously Designated Allocated Tags . For established capped or controlled hunts, allocated tags will first be designated to each outfitting oper ation in an amount equal to the outfitting operation's use of the allocated tags previously designated to it for the same hunt. ( ) a. In a capped hunt, the use of previously designated a llocated tags is the average use of allocated tags in the preceding two (2) years; in the event that IFGC adjusts the number of allocated tags in a hunt where there is only one (1) year of allocation, the Boar d will not average the use. ( ) b. In a controlled hunt, the use of previously design ated allocated tags is the highest year of use of allocated tags in the preceding two (2) years. ( ) 05. Remaining or Additional Allocated Tags . Allocated tags not designated above will be designated proportionately as follows: ( ) a. Subtract each outfitting operation's use of previously designated allocated tags from Subsection 257.04 from its base allocation number to determine the number of non-allocated tags it used for a capped hunt or the matching hunt with non-allocated tags for a controlled hunt, when necessary to determine non-allocated tag use; then ( ) b. Divide the result by the total number of non-allocated tags used by all outfitting operations, resulting in a percentage of the total non-allocated tags used by outfitting operations in that hunt. Truncate the decimal at the hundredths place; and finally ( ) c. Multiply the percentage of total use from Subsection 257.05.b. by the number of allocated tags yet to be designated, which determines the number of allocated tags designated to the outfitting operation. ( ) 06. Rounding . If allocated tag designation results in a partial tag, the calculation will be rounded up when a decimal equals or exceeds six tenths (0.6) and r ounded down when a decimal is less than six tenths (0.6). When calculating after a reduction of allocated tags purs uant to Section 36-2120(4), Idaho Code, the calculation will DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL AND PROFESSI ONAL LICENSES Docket No. 24-3501-2201 Rules of the Outfitters and Guides Licensing Board Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 226 September 7, 2022 - Vol. 22-9be rounded up when a decimal equals or exceeds five tent hs (0.5) and rounded down when a decimal is less than five tenths (0.5). ( ) 07. Tie-breaker . If, after applying Subsections 257.03 through 06, there is a surplus or deficit of allocated tags to be designated, the unrounded proportion from Subsection 257.05, with as many decimal places as necessary, will be used, and then as follows: ( ) a. After a reduction in allocated tags, surplus tags will first be designated in amounts to restore outfitter operations to the number of tags that would have otherwise been designated pursuant to Subsection 257.04 or as close thereto as practicable. ( ) b. If a surplus, the outfitting operation whose unrounded proportion is the greatest will be designated one (1) tag, and if there are additional surplus tags, the outfitter with the next greatest unrounded proportion will be designated one (1) allocated tag, and repeated in descending unrounded proportions until all surplus tags are designated. In the event there is more than one outfitting operation with the same unrounded proportion and there are insufficient undesignated tags to designate to each outfit ter, the undesignated tag will be designated based on a random drawing between those outfitting operations. ( ) c. A deficit will be resolved from the outfitting operation whose unrounded proportion is closest to six tenths (0.6), and then next closest to six tenths (0.6) when th ere is a deficit of more than one (1) allocated tag. If there is more than one (1) outfitting operation with the same unrounded proportion, a random drawing will be held between those outfitters. ( ) 08. Stipulation by Outfitters . Outfitting operations in a hunt may submit to the Board a written stipulation determining the number of allocated tags de signated to each outfitting operation in that hunt. The stipulation must be signed by all eligible outfitting operations for the hunt; however, under special circumstances, the Board may waive the requirement of approval from all ot her outfitting operations. If the Board approves the stipulation, the stipulation will be effective until the next designation of allocated tags for the hunt. On or before November 1 preceding the hunt, any outfitting operation may petition the Board to vacate the stipulation for good cause that would make it unconscionable or unjust to enfor ce the stipulation. If the Board vacates the stipulation, the allocated tags in that hunt will be designated pursuant to Section 36-2120, Idaho Code, and this rule. ( ) 09. Undesignated Tag Pool . Any designated allocated tags that are surrendered or have not been utilized by an outfitting operation on or before July 16 or the next business day for a capped hunt, or on or before September 10 or the next business day for a controlled hunt, will be available in an undesignated pool for any outfitting operation, as follows: ( ) a. Beginning April 10 preceding the hunt, an outfitting operation may submit a request for an allocated tag from the pool. The request must be on a Board-approved form. ( ) b. Beginning April 20 preceding the hunt or next busin ess day, an allocated tag will be designated from the pool on a first-come, first-served basis to an outfitting operation without any designated allocated tags or which has utilized all of its designated allocated tags, using a waiting list when necessary. A maximum of two (2) allocated tags will be designated to each requesting outfitti ng operation until all other requesting outfitting operations have been served, then a requesting outfitting operation is eligible to receive a maximum of two (2) additional allocated tags from the pool, repeated until all requesting outfitting operations are served or until no tags remain. ( ) 10. Objection to Calculation . If an outfitting operation believes the calculation is incorrect, it may object by filing a petition with the Board within fourteen (14) days from the date the notification was sent and in accordance with the Idaho Administrative Procedures Act. The petition will include any supporting information or documentation. ( ) a. All outfitting operations in the hunt in question will be notified of the petition. ( ) b. The ou t fitting operation bears the burden of establishi ng that the calculation was incorrect. ( )DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL AND PROFESSI ONAL LICENSES Docket No. 24-3501-2201 Rules of the Outfitters and Guides Licensing Board Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 227 September 7, 2022 - Vol. 22-911. Hardship Request . An outfitting operation may submit a written hardship request to maintain all or a portion of previous outfitted hunter tag use history when the outfitting operation shows good cause that its use of allocated designated tags was impacted by circumstances beyond the outfitting operation's control. The request must be submitted on or before a deadline set by the Board. The outfitting operation must provide information or documentation as requested by the Board to substantiate the request. ( ) 12. Change in Operating Area or Owner of Business . When an outfitting operation is sold or when an operating area is adjusted through a sale and designated allocated tags are associated with the affected operating area, the associated designated allocated tags and tag use history will transfer to the new owner. ( ) 258. NUMBER OF OUTFITTERS AND GUIDES LIMITED. Big Lost and Little Lost Rivers and the Big Wood and the Little Wood Rivers - All reaches from headwaters to the termination of the flow of the Big Lost and the Little Lost Rivers and all reaches of the Big Wood and Little Wood Rivers are limited to a maximum of five (5) outfitters on both rivers combined.

The written statement must state specific reasons for use of the brand name specification. ( )DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION Docket No. 38-0501-2201 Rules of the Division of Purchasing Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 307 September 7, 2022 - Vol. 22-9b.

This rulemaking action is authorized by Sections 39-105, 39-107, 39-114, and 39-115. This rulemaking updates federal regulations incorporated by reference as mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for approval of Idaho's Title V Operating Permit Program pursuant to 40 CFR Part 70 and fulfilling the requirements of Idaho's delegation agreement with EPA under Section 112(l) of the Clean Air Act. It also updates citations to other federal regulations necessary to retain state primacy of Clean Air Act programs. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Pursuant to Section 67-5222, Idaho Code, a public hearing has been scheduled and will be held as follows: The meeting location will be accessible to persons with disabilities, and language translators will be made available upon request. To request accommodations for langu age translation, contact the undersigned by October 6, 2022.DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: DEQ initiated this rulemaking in compliance No. 2020-01 , Zero-Based Regulation (EO 2020-01), issued by Governor Little on January 16, 2020. Pursuant to EO 2020-01, each rule chapter effective on June 30, 2020, shall be reviewed by the agency that promulgated the rule. The review will be conducted according to a schedule established by the Division of Financial Management, Office of the Governor (DFM). This is one of the DEQ rule chapters up for review in 2022. The goal of the rulemaking is to perform a critical and co mprehensive review of the en tire chapter in an attempt to reduce overall regulatory burden, streamline vari ous provisions, and increase clarity and ease of use. This rulemaking updates federal regulations incorporated by reference with the July 1, 2022 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) effective date. The July 1, 2022 CFR is a codification of federal regulations published in the Federal Register as of July 1, 2022. To ensure that the state rules remain consistent with federal regulations, the Rules for the Control of Air Pollution in Idaho, IDAPA 58.01.01, are updated annually to maintain consistency with the federal regulations implementing the Clean Air Act. This rulemaking also includes the revised fee structure of a Clean Air Act mandated air permitting program negotiated under Docket No. 58-0101-1902 . Sections 387 - 397. Major industrial sources of air pollution are required to have a Title V operating permit. In Idaho, the Title V permitting program is administered by DEQ. The Clean Air Act requires these industrial sources to pay on-going annual fees to cover all reasonable costs associated with the Title V permitting program (Clean Air Act 42 USC 7661a(b)(3) and implementation regulation at 40 CFR 70.9). In January 2018, the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) decreased its emissions such that it will no longer be required to *Public Hearing* Tuesday, October 11, 2022 2:30 p.m. (MT) In-person participation is available at: DEQ State Office 1410 N Hilton St Conference Center Boise, ID Or Join Zoom Meeting The meeting link is available at: https://www.deq.idaho.gov/air-quality-docket-no-58-0101-2101/DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0101-2101 Rules for the Control of Air Pollution in Idaho Proposed (Fee) Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 326 September 7, 2022 - Vol. 22-9have a Title V operating permit and, therefore, will no l onger pay Title V permitting fees. Since the inception of the Title V permitting program, the INL has paid a Title V permitting fee of $500,000, which covered far more than its share of program costs. Without this significant sum, it wa s necessary for DEQ to negotiate a revision to the current fee structure to ensure there is sufficient funding to cover the costs of administering the Title V program in Idaho. Other than the incorporation by reference update and the Title V fee structure changes, no substantive changes were made in this proposed rule docket. Because this is the promulgation of a new rule chapter, the proposed rule does not contain strike-out/underline text. A document prepared by DEQ showing the proposed rule revisions in strike-out/underline format can be viewed here. Members of the regulated community who may be subject to Idaho's air quality rules, facilities with Title V permits, special interest groups, public officials, and members of the public who have an interest in the regulation of air emissions from sources in Idaho may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Idaho Board of Environmental Quality (Board) in November 2022 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2023 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Idaho Legislature. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: The revised Title V fee structure was negotiated under Docket No. 58-0101- 1902. In May 2019, the Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking was published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin, and the preliminary draft rule was posted on DEQ's website. Meetings were held on May 7, 2019, August 24, 2021, and October 5, 2021. In October 2021, the Notice of Intent to Promulgate Rules - Zero-Based Regulation Negotiated Rulemaking for Docket No. 58-0101-2101 was published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin, and the preliminary draft rule was posted on DEQ's website. Meetings were held on October 28, 2021; November 30, 2021; and March 29, 2022. Stakeholders and members of the public participated by receiving email notifications, reviewing DEQ's presentations and supporting information, attending meetings, and submitting comments. Key information was posted on DEQ's website and distributed to persons who participated in the negotiated rulemaking. All comments received during the negotiated rulema king process were considered by DEQ when making decisions regarding the development of the rule. At the conclusion of the negotiated rulemaking process, DEQ inserted the revised Title V fee structure negotiated under Docket No. 58-0101-1902 and submitted the draft rule to DFM for review. DEQ formatted the draft for publication as a proposed rule and is now seeking public comment. The negotiated rulemaking record, which includes the negotiated rule drafts, documents distributed during the negotiated rulemaking process, and the negotiated rulemaking summary, is available at https://www.deq.idaho.gov/air-quality- docket-no-58-0101-2101/ . INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the incorpora tion by reference is necessary: Adoption of federal regulations is necessary to mainta in program primacy. Incorporation by reference allows DEQ to keep its rules up to date with federal regul ation changes and simplifies compliance for the regulated community. Information for obtaining a copy of the federal regulations is included in the rule. In compliance with Idaho Code 67-5223(4), DEQ prepared a brief synopsis detailing the substantive differences between the previously incorpor ated material and the latest revised edition or version of the incorporated material being proposed for incorporation by reference.

EXCESS EMISSIONS. 01. Applicability . The owner or operator of a facility or emissions unit generating excess emissions must comply with Sections 131, 132, 133.01, 134.01, 134.02, 134.03, 135, and 136, as applicable. If the owner or operator anticipates requesting consideration under Subsecti on 131.02, then the owner or operator must also comply with the applicable provisions of Subsections 133.02, 133.03, 134.04, and 134.05. ( ) 02. Enforcement Action Criteria . Where an excess emissions event occurs as a direct result of startup, shutdown, or scheduled maintenance, or an unavoidable upset or unavoidable breakdown, or the implementation of a safety measure, the Department will consider the sufficiency of the information submitted and the following criteria to determine if an enforcement action to impose penalties is warranted: ( ) a. Whether prior to the excess emissions event, the owner or operator submitted and implemented procedures pursuant to Subsections 133.02 and ( ) b. Whether the owner or operator complied with all relevant portions of Subsections 131, 132, 133.01, 134.01, 134.02, 134.03, 135, and 136; c. Whether the excess emissions event was part of a recurring pattern of excess emissions events indicative of inadequate design, operation or maintenance of the facility or emissions unit; and ( ) d. Where appropriate, whether the excess emissions event was caused by an activity necessary to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage. ( ) 03. Effect of Determination . Any decision by the Department under Subsection 131.02 will not excuse the owner or operator from compliance with th e relevant emission standard and will not preclude the Department from taking an enforcement action to enjoin the activity causing the excess emissions. Any decision made by the Department under Subsection 131.02 does not preclude the Department from taking an enforcement action for future or other excess emission events. The affi rmative defense for emergencies under Section 332 may be applied in addition to the provisions of Sections 130 through 136. ( ) 132. CORRECTION OF CONDITION. The person responsible for, or in charge of a facility during, an excess emissions event must, with all practicable speed, initiate and complete appropriate and reasonable action to correct the conditions causing such excess emissions event; to reduce the frequency of occurrence of such events; to minimize the amount by which the emission standard is exceeded; and must, as provided below or upon request of the Department, submit a full report of such occurrence, including a statement of all known causes, and of the scheduling and nature of the actions to be taken. ( ) 133. STARTUP, SHUTDOWN AND SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS.The requirements in Subsection 133.01 apply in all cases where startup, shutdown, or scheduled maintenance of any equipment or emissions unit is expected to result or results in an excess emissions event. The owner or operator of the facility or emissions unit generating the excess emissions must demonstrate compliance with all of the requirements of Subsection 133.01, as well as the development and implementation of procedures pursuant to Subsections 133.02 and 133.03 as a prerequisite to any consideration under Subsection 131.02. ( ) 01. General Provisions . The following pertains to all startup, shutdown, and scheduled maintenance activities expected to result or resulting in excess emissions. The owner or operator of a source of excess emissions must: ( ) a. Ensure that no scheduled startup, shutdown, or maintenance resulting in excess emissions occurs during any period in which an Air Quality Advisory has been declared by the Department within an area designated by the Department as a PM10 nonattainment area, unless the permittee demonstrates that such is reasonably necessary to facility operations and cannot be reasonably avoided and the Department approves such activity in advance, to the extent advance approval by the Department is feasible. This prohibition on scheduled startup, shutdown or maintenance activities during Advisories does not apply to situations where shutdown is necessitated by urgent situations, such as imminent equipment failure, power curtailment, worker sa fety concerns or similar DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0101-2101 Rules for the Control of Air Pollution in Idaho Proposed (Fee) Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 345 September 7, 2022 - Vol. 22-9situations. ( ) b. Notify the Department of any startup, shutdown, or scheduled maintenance event that is expected to cause an excess emissions event. Such notification mu st identify the time of the excess emissions, specific location, equipment involved, and type of excess emissions event (i.e. startup, shutdown, or scheduled maintenance). The notification must be given as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than two (2) hours prior to the start of the excess emissions event unless the owner or operator demons trates to the Department's satisfaction that a shorter advanced notice was necessary. The Department may prohibit or postpone any scheduled startup, shutdown, or maintenance activity upon consideration of the factors listed in Subsection 134.03; ( ) c. Report and record the information required purs uant to Sections 135 and 136 for each excess emissions event due to startup, shutdown, or scheduled maintenance and ( ) d.

The requirements in Subsections 134.01, 134.02, and 134.03 apply in all cases where upset or breakdown of equipment or an emissions unit, or the initiation of safety measures, result or may result in an excess emissions event. The owner or operator of the facility or emissions unit generating the excess emissions must demonstrate compliance with all of the requirements of Subsections 134.01, 134.02 and 134.03 as well as the development and implementation of procedures pursuant to Subsections 134.04 and 134.05 as a prerequisite to any consideration under Subsection 131.02. Where the owner or operator demonstrates that because of the unforeseeable nature of the excess emissions event it is impractical to develop procedures pursuant to Subsection 134.04, the Department will exercise its enforcement discretion on a case-by-case basis. ( ) 01. Routine Maintenance and Repairs. For all equipment or emissions units from which excess emissions may occur during upset conditions or breakdowns or implementation of safety measures, the facility owner or operator must: ( ) a. Implement routine preventative maintenance and operating procedures consistent with good pollution control practices for minimizing upsets and breakdowns or events requiring implementation of safety measures, and ( ) b. Make routine repairs in an expeditious fashion when the owner or operator knew or should have known that an excess emissions event was likely to occur. Off -shift labor and overtime must be utilized, to the extent practicable, to ensure that such repairs are made expeditiously. ( ) 02. Excess Emissions Minimization and Notification . For all equipment or emissions units from which excess emissions result during upset or breakdown conditions, or for other situations that may necessitate the implementation of safety measures which cause excess emissi ons, the facility owner or operator must: ( ) a. Immediately undertake all appropri ate measures to reduce and, to the extent possible, eliminate excess emissions resulting from the event and to minimize th e impact of such excess emissions on the ambient air quality and public health; ( ) b. Notify the Department of any upset/breakdown/safet y event that results in excess emissions. Such notification must identify the time, specific location, equipment or emissions unit involved, and (to the extent known) the caus e (s) of the occurrence. The notification must be given as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the event, unless the owner or operator demonstrates to the Department's satisfaction that the longer reporting period was necessary; and ( ) c. Report and record the information required purs uant to Sections 135 and 136 for each excess emissions event caused by an upset, breakdown, or safety measure.

Discretionary Reduction or Cessation Provisions . During any period of excess emissions caused by upset, breakdown, or operation under facility safety measures, the Department may require the owner or operator to immediately reduce or cease operation of the equipment or emissions unit causing the excess emissions until such time as the condition causing the excess emissions has been corrected or brought under control. Such action by the Department will be taken upon consideration of the following factors and after consultation with the facility owner or operator: ( ) a. Potential risk to the public or the environment. ( ) b. Whether ceasing operations could result in physi cal damage to the equipment, emissions unit or facility, or cause injury to employees. ( ) c. Whether continued excess emissions were reas onably unavoidable as determined by the Department. ( ) d. The effect of the increase in pollution resulting from the shutdown and subsequent restart of the equipment or emissions unit or facility. ( ) e. The owner or operator is not required to reduce or cease operations at the entire facility if reducing or ceasing operations at a portion of the facility eliminates or adequately reduces the excess emissions. ( ) 04. Procedures . For equipment or emissions units and process upsets and breakdowns and situations that require implementation of safety m easures, events that can reasonably be anticipated to occur periodically but that cannot be reasonably avoided or predicted with certa inty, the owner or operator must prepare, implement, and file with the Department specific procedures that will be used to minimize such events and excess emissions during such events. To the extent possible and reasonably practicable (and based upon knowledge of the process or emissions where measured data is not available), specify th e following information for each type of anticipated upset/ breakdown/safety event: ( ) a. The specific air pollution control equipment or em issions unit and the type of event anticipated. ( ) b. The specific emissions in excess of applicable emi ssion standards during the event. ( ) c.

Mobile Sources . The proposed level of allowable emissions must be less than the actual emissions of the mobile sources or stationary sources providing the emission reduction credit. Mobile source emission reduction credits will be made state or federally enforceable by SIP revision. The form of the SIP revision may be a state or local regulation, operating permit condition, consent or enfo rcement order, or any mechanism available to the state that is enforceable. ( ) 461. REQUIREMENTS FOR BANKING EMISSION REDUCTION CREDITS (ERC'S). 01. Application to Bank an ERC . The owner or operator of any facility may apply to the Department for a Tier I or Tier II operating permit (or a revision thereto) to bank an emission reduction credit. An application to bank an emission reduction credit must be received by the Department no later than one (1) year after the reduction occurs. The Department may issue or revise such a Tier I or Tier II operating permit and a \"Certificate of Ownership\" for an emission reduction credit, provided that all emission reductions satisfy the requirements of Section 460. ( ) 02. Banking Period . Emission reduction credits may be banked with the Department. The banked emission reduction credits may be used for offsets, netting in accordance with the definition of net emissions increase at Section 007, or sold to other facilities. The use of ba nked emission reduction credit s must satisfy the applicable requirements of the program in which they are proposed for use, including approval of a permit to construct or a Tier I or Tier II operating permit. ( ) 03. Certificate of Ownership . Upon issuing or revising a Tier I or Tier II operating permit for an emission reduction credit, the Department will issue a \"Certificate of Ownership\" that will identify the owner of the credits, quantify the credited emission reduction and describe the characteristics of the emissions that were reduced and emissions unit(s) that previously emitted them. ( ) 04. Adjustment by Department . If at any time the Department, or the owner or operator of a facility that has produced an emission reduction credit, finds that the actual reduction in emissions differs from that in the certificate of ownership, the Department will adjust the amount of banked emission reduction credits to reflect the actual emission reduction and issue a revised certificate of ownership. ( ) 05. Proportional Discounts . If at any time the Department finds that additional emission reductions are necessary to attain and maintain any ambient air qu ality standard or applicable prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) increment, banked emission reduc tion credits at facilities in the affected area may be proportionally discounted by an amount that will not ex ceed the percentage of emission reduction required for that area. ( ) 06. Transfer of Ownership . Whenever the holder of a certificat e of ownership for banked emission reduction credits, sells or otherwise transfers ownership of all or part of the banked credits, the holder must submit the certificate of ownership to the Department. The Department will issue a revised certificate(s) of ownership that reflects the old and new holder(s) and amount(s) of banked emission reduction credits. ( ) 07. Public Registry . The Department will maintain a public registry of all banked emissions reduction credits, indicating the current holder of each certificate of ownership and the amount and type of credited emissions.

(RESERVED) 790. RULES FOR THE CONTROL OF NONMETALLIC MINERAL PROCESSING PLANTS. Sections 790 through 799 establish the requirements for no nmetallic mineral processing plants, frequently referred to as rock crushers. Definitions for nonmetallic mineral processing plants can be found in 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart OOO. Compliance with Section 790 does not relieve the owner or operator of a nonmetallic mineral processing plant from the responsibility of complying with other federal, state, and local applicable laws, regulations, and requirements. ( ) 791. GENERAL CONTROL REQUIREMENTS. 01. Prohibition . No owner or operator of a nonmetallic mineral processing plant will allow, suffer, or cause the emissions of any air pollutant to the atmosphere in such quantity of such nature and duration and under such conditions as would be injurious to human health or welfare, to animal or plant life, or to property, or to interfere unreasonably with the enjoyment of life or property. ( ) 02. Control of Fugitive Dust . In accordance with Sections 650 and 651, owners and operators of nonmetallic mineral processing plants must take all reasonable precautions to prevent the generation of fugitive dust. In determining what is reasonable, consideration will be given to factors such as the proximity to human habitations and/or activities and atmospheric conditions that might aff ect the movement of particulate matter. ( ) 792. (RESERVED) 793. EMISSIONS STANDARDS FOR NONMETALLIC MINERAL PROCESSING PLANTS NOT SUBJECT TO 40 CFR PART 60, SUBPART OOO. Owners and operators of nonmetallic mineral processing plants that are not subject to a 40 CFR Part 60 requirement must comply with the emissions standards set forth in Section 793. ( )Notes: 1. The ammonia emission reduction effectiveness of each practice is rated numerically based on practical year- round implementation. Variations due to seasonal practices and expected weather conditions have been factored into these ratings. Not implementing a BMP when it is not practicable to do so, does not reduce the point value assigned to the BMP, nor does it constitute failure to per form the BMP. UD indicates that the practice is still under development. 2. Land application practices assume practice is conducted on all manure; points will be pro-rated to reflect actual waste treatment; points can be obtained on exported material with sufficient documentation. 3. Method used by inspector to determine compliance 1=Observation by Inspector 2=On-Site Recordkeeping Required3, 4=Deviation Reporting Required. Equipment upsets and/or breakdowns must be recorded in a deviation log and if repaired in a reasonable timeframe does not constitute non-compliance with this rule.Ammonia Control Practices for Idaho Effectiveness1 System ComponentOpen LotFreestall ScrapeFreestall FlushCompliance Method3DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0101-2101 Rules for the Control of Air Pollution in Idaho Proposed (Fee) Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 482 September 7, 2022 - Vol. 22-901.

( ) i. When fugitive dust emissions are observed at any time to be exceeding any control strategy trigger specified in Subsections 799.02 through 799.06, that event triggers initiation of the prescribed control strategy or control strategies to control the fugitive dust emissions. ( ) ii. Citizen complaints of failure to reasonably control fugitive dust must be expeditiously evaluated by the owner or operator for merit. If the owner or operator determines the complaint has merit, the progressive strategy must be expeditiously employed to reasonably control fugitive dust. The Department may review the complaint records and investigate citizen complaints as appropriate. If the Department finds that a complaint has merit, it may determine additional control measures are required. ( ) b. A progressive control strategy must be used to reasonably control the em issions of fugitive dust. Progressive control strategy means that if the initial control strategy or strategies chosen do not adequately control fugitive dust emissions, the owner or operator must employ successive control strategies as listed until fugitive dust control is achieved. Fugitive dust control must be applied on a frequency such that visible emissions do not exceed any emission standard specified in Sections 790 through 799. ( ) c. The owner or operator must maintain a record of each event where a control strategy is triggered. The trigger must be recorded with a summary of the control strategy employed. If the trigger is a citizen complaint, the owner or operator must record the complaint, an evaluation of whether the complaint has merit, and a summary of the corrective action taken. The record must be maintained on forms provided by the Department or other forms that contain similar information. Records for current operations must be maintained at the site of operations for the duration of operations at that location and must be available to Department representatives upon request. Records for previous sites of operation must be kept for the most recent two (2) year period at a location where they can be reasonably accessed and must be made available to the Department upon request.

Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before September 21, 2022. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held.DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The purpose of this rulemaking is to ensure that the state rules remain consistent with federal regulations. Idaho's Rules and Standards for Hazardous Wa ste, IDAPA 58.01.05, are updated annually to maintain consistency with the federal regulations implementing the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) as directed by the Idaho Hazardous Waste Management Act (HWMA). This proposed rule updates federal regulations incorporated by reference with the July 1, 2022 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) effective date. The July 1, 2022 CFR is a codification of federal regulations published in the Federal Register as of July 1, 2022. Citizens of the state of Idaho; environmental groups; persons interested in hazardous waste; and hazardous waste generators, transporters, and treatment, storage, and disposal facilities may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Idaho Board of Environmental Quality in November 2022 for adopti on of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2023 legislative se ssion if adopted by the Board and approved by the Idaho Legislature.INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the materials cited are being incorporated by reference into this rule: Adoption of federal regulations is necessary to mainta in program primacy. Incorporation by reference allows DEQ to keep its rules up to date with federal regul ation changes and simplifies compliance for the regulated community. Information for obtaining a copy of the federal regulations is included in the rule. In compliance with Idaho Code 67-5223(4), DEQ prepared a brief synopsis detailing the substantive difference between the previously incorpor ated material and the latest revised edition or version of the incorporated material being proposed for incorporation by reference.

This action is authorized by Chapter 1, Title 39, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled. Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before September 21, 2022. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held.DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: DEQ initiated this rulemaking in compliance with Executive Order No. 2020-01, Zero-Based Regulation (EO 2020-01), issued by Governor Little on January 16, 2020. Pursuant to EO 2020-01, each rule chapter effective on June 30, 2020, shall be reviewed by the agency that promulgated the rule. The review will be conducted according to a schedule established by the Division of Financial Management, Office of the Governor (DFM), posted at https://adminrules.idaho.gov/forms_menu.html . This is one of the DEQ rule chapters up for review in 2022. The goal of the rulemaking is to perform a critical and co mprehensive review of the en tire chapter in an attempt to reduce overall regulatory burden, streamline vari ous provisions, and increase clarity and ease of use. This rulemaking also includes provisions that will allow DEQ to issue general reuse permits. General permits will be issued for specific but common uses of recycled water that need less DEQ oversight due to the nature and/or volume of the recycled water. General reuse permits will reduce the permitting process for certain uses of recycled water while still being protective of human health and the enviroment. Because this is the promulgation of a new rule chapter, the proposed rule does not contain strike-out/underline text. A document prepared by DEQ showing the proposed rule revisions in strike-out/underline format can be viewed here. Citizens of the state of Idaho, environmental groups, and owners and operators of recycled water facilities may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Idaho Board of Environmental Quality (Board) in November 2022 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2023 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Idaho Legislature.NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: On April 6, 2022, the notice of negotiated rulemaking was published in the Idaho Administrative Bulletin, and on April 20, 2022, a preliminary draft rule was posted on DEQ's website. Meetings were held on May 4 and June 7, 2022. Stakeholders and me mbers of the public participated by receiving email notifications, attending the meetings, reviewing DEQ's presentations, and submitting comments. Key information was posted on DEQ's website and distributed to persons who participated in the negotiated rulemaking. All comments received during the negotiated rulema king process were considered by DEQ when making decisions regarding the development of the rule. At the conclusion of the negotiated rulemaking process, DEQ submitted the draft rule to DFM for review. DEQ formatted the draft for publication as a proposed rule and is now seeking public comment. The negotiated rulemaking record , which includes the negotiated rule drafts, documents distributed during the negotiated rulemaking process, and the negotiated rulemaking summary, is available at https:// www.deq.idaho.gov/recycled-water-docket-no-58-0117-2201/ . INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the incorporation by reference is necessary: Not applicable.DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0117-2201 Recycled Water Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 492 September 7, 2022 - Vol. 22-9IDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: IDAPA 58.01.17, Recycled Water Rules, ensure that the permitted use of recycled water does not harm human health and the enviroment or violate the Department's Water Quality Standards, IDAPA 58.01.02, or the Ground Water Quality Rule, IDAPA 58.01.11. The federal government does not regulate or permit the use of recycled water. The statutory authority for these rules is contained in Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 39-102, 39-105, 39-115 and 39-118. Idaho Code \u00a7 39-115 provides the Director with the authority to issue pollution source permits in compliance with rules. Idaho Code \u00a7 39-118 requires all plans and specifications and record plans \"for the construction of new sewage systems, sewage treatment plants or systems\" to \"be submitted to and approved by the director before construction may begin, and all construction shall be in substantial compliance therewith.\" Idaho Code \u00a7 39-105(2) requires the Director to \"formulate and recommend to the board rules as may be necessary to deal with problems related to water pollut ion...and licensure and certification requirements pertinent thereto.\" Idaho Code \u00a7 39-102(3)(a) states: \"It is the policy of the state to prevent contamination of ground water from any source to the maximum extent practical.\" Most of the substantive provisions of these rules were adopted after 2003, thus, if they were based on science or included a standard necessary to prot ect human health and the environment, they have already been approved as meeting Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 39-107D(2) and (3) requirements. The remaining provisions are not specific science-based requirements or standards. Rather, they are (1) proced ural requirements that are primarily necessary for the Department to properly process reuse permits, or (2) constr uction-related requirements to ensure land application does not harm human health and the environment or violate Water Quality Standards or the Ground Water Quality Rule. FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: Not applicable.

For purposes of compliance with federal tax law, an Employer, as defined in Section 59- 1302(15), Idaho Code must also meet each of the requirements of Paragraphs a. through c. of this definition, taking into account all of the facts and circumstances. Entities that may qualify as political subdivisions include, among others, general purpose governmental entities, such as cities and counties (whether or not incorporated as municipal corporations), and special purpose governmental entities, such as special assessment districts that provide for roads, water, sewer, gas, light, reclamation, drainage, irrigation, levee, school, harbor, port improvements, and other governmental purposes for a State or local governmental unit. (3-31-22) a. Sovereign powers . Pursuant to a state or local law of general application, the entity has a delegated right to exercise a substantial amount of at leas t one (1) of the following recognized sovereign powers of a state or local governmental unit: The power of taxation, the power of eminent domain, and police power. (3-31-22) b. Governmental purpose . The entity serves a governmental purpose. The determination of whether an entity serves a governmental purpose is based on, among other things, whether the entity carries out the public purposes that are set forth in the entity's enabling legislation and whether the entity operates in a manner that provides a significant public benefit with no more than incidental private benefit. (3-31-22) c. Governmental control . A state or local governmental unit exercises control over the entity. For this purpose, control is defined in Subparagraph 005.08.c.i. of this rule and a state or local governmental unit exercises such control only if the control is vested in persons described in Subparagraph 005.08.c.ii. of this rule. (3-31-22) i. Definition of control. \"Control\" means an ongoing right or power to direct significant actions of the entity. Rights or powers may establish control either individually or in the aggregate. Among rights or powers that may establish control, an ongoing ability to exercise one or more of the following significant rights or powers, on a discretionary and non-ministerial basis, constitutes control: the right or power both to approve and to remove a majority of the governing body of the entity; the right or power to elect a majority of the governing body of the entity in periodic elections of reasonable frequency; or the right or power to approve or direct the significant uses of funds or assets of the entity in advance of that use. Procedures designed to ensure the integrity of the entity but not to direct significant actions of the entity are insufficient to constitute control of an entity. Examples of such procedures include requirements for submission of audited financial statements of the entity to a higher level state or local governmental unit, open meeting requirements, and conflicts of interest limitations. (3-31-22) ii. Control vested in a state or local governmental unit or an electorate. Control is vested in persons described as a state or local governmental unit possessing a substantial amount of each of the sovereign powers and acting through its governing body or through its duly authorized elected or appointed officials in their official capacities or an electorate established under applicable state or local law of general application, provided the electorate is not a private faction. (3-31-22) iii. Definition of \"private faction.\" A private faction is any electorate if the outcome of the exercise of control described in Subparagraph 005.08.c.i. of this rule is determined solely by the votes of an unreasonably small number of private persons. The determination of whether a number of such private persons is unreasonably small depends on all of the facts and circumstances, including, without limitation, the entity's governmental purpose, the number of members in the electorate, th e relationships of the members of the electorate to one another, the manner of apportionment of votes within the electorate, and the extent to which the members of the electorate adequately represent the interests of persons reasonably affected by the entity's actions.
