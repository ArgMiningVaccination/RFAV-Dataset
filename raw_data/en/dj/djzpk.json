This month I'm offering you a short and sweet guided, grounding meditation to turn down the volume in your head so you can tune into the wisdom of your heart. Less Anxiety? More Compassion? Yes Please! Turning towards yourself with love and attention is a practice. If you are looking for a way to reduce anxiety and increase self-compassion (aka more love, peace and ease in your life) I highly recommend starting a daily self-care practice such as meditation or breathwork (just like the one I recorded for you below...keep reading). I get it, it can be overwhelming to know where to start, what to practice and how to make it stick. I recommend choosing a 1-5 minute practice (such as the meditation below or this [inner wisdom meditation](https://stingray-garlic-r9y3.squarespace.com/blog/meditation-and-mindfulness/inner-wisdom-guided-meditation)) and commit to practicing as often as you can for the next 30-60 days. This doesn't mean you'll remember to practice every day, it just means making the practice and yourself a priority until it becomes a habit. What is a Grounding Meditation? Grounding is the practice of bringing your attention and energy in and down, to soothe anxiety and quiet racing thoughts. In this meditation you will learn to cultivate kindness and compassion for yourself as you access the infinite wisdom of your body through your breath and focused attention. Sound complicated? Don't worry I'll be guiding you the entire time, you just have to sit, be curious, and listen. This is a great practice for when your mind is in overdrive, anxiety is interrupting your day, or you just can't connect to your heart. But...I Can't Meditate, Now What? Meditation gets a bad rap. So many people have given up on meditation being helpful because they can't 'make their mind be still'. It's a common misperception that meditation means you can sit and have no thoughts. Your brain's job is actually to think, so if you have a mind, it will be thinking! :) Here's what I want you to know: If you are a human, and breathing, you can meditate (promise!). I encourage you to try the following guided meditation and see how it goes. Check in with the quality of your thoughts, your feelings and the tension in your body before and after the practice. If you notice even 1% more ease, more calm and/or less tension, then I would encourage you to keep practicing. One minute a day cultivating compassion adds up to a lot more self-care over time than zero minutes a day. Remember that meditation is not just about making the mind be quiet, but about connecting with your Self, your deep inner wisdom and radiant heart, one breath at a time. And hey, sometimes sitting in stillness with your breath, body and heart can activate deep discomfort and be more activating than it is relaxing. If this happens for you, I would encourage you to seek out a meditation teacher or [holistic therapist](/holistic-psychotherapists) to help you find a practice that will be supportive and transformative. I am trained as both a holistic therapist as well as a meditation and yoga teacher, so [reach out](/contact-holistic-psychotherapist) if you are looking for support. How to Practice this Meditation I made this quick and effective 5 minute guided meditation to help you reduce symptoms of anxiety and overwhelm so you can experience more ease and calm in your mind, heart and body, starting today. I hope you'll take the time to practice and see how it impacts you. All you need to do is find a comfortable place to sit or lay down where you won't be disturbed for 5 minutes. Go ahead and find a spot.... Now take a deep breath in and out... Press play and enjoy the practice! xoKim If you feel moved or inspired by this meditation please share with your friends on social media. Your support means the world to me PS.
