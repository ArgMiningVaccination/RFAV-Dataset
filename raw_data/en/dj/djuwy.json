When our wishes and hopes rush at us like wild animals, when our per-sonal agendas and self-serving desires threaten to determine the course of our day, we ask that You would interrupt the cacophony of chaos and speak Your grace to us. Envelop us in the wideness of Your mercy and show us Your com-passion. You, O Lord, are a God of justice. When our understanding of equity is dimmed by our sense of entitlement and our urge to be right blinds us from pursuing what is moral, repair our re-lationships with Your righteous judg-ment. Then, as You envelop us in the wideness of Your mercy, show us how to show compassion. God, You do not spare us the bread of adversity nor the water of affliction. Open our eyes to that which You reveal to us in these moments, open our ears that we would hear the assurance of Your voice, and open our hearts to re-ceive Your salvation. For by Your grace, You envelop us in the wideness of Your mercy and in You we will find compassion. In Your loving name we pray. Amen. f THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has exam- ined the Journal of the last day's pro-ceedings and announces to the Cham-ber her approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1 of rule I, the Journal stands approved. PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. C OMER ) come for- ward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. COMER led the Pledge of Alle- giance as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub- lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter- tain up to 15 requests for 1-minute speeches on each side of the aisle. f HONORING ROSA PARKS (Ms. SEWELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor an American native, an Alabama native, and a civil rights icon, Mrs. Rosa Parks, on the 67th anniver-sary of her historic arrest. On this day, December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, Mrs. Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat, tak-ing a bold stand against Montgomery's segregated bus system. Her dignified courage sparked the beginning of the Montgomery bus boycott and changed the very fabric of our Nation. As the Representative of Alabama's Seventh Congressional District, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 5111, the Rosa Parks Day Act, which would designate today, Decem-ber 1, as a Federal holiday in her honor. This bill would ensure that her brave sacrifice will live on in American his-tory forever, and I urge my colleagues to sign on. As we reflect on her courage, let us never forget the power of ordinary Americans to achieve extraordinary so-cial change. In the words of Rosa Parks, I urge you all to ''never be fearful about what you are doing when it is right.'' f IT IS TIME TO RETURN TO AMERICAN ENERGY DOMINANCE (Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, last night, the temperature in my hometown of Altoona, Pennsyl-vania, was 28 degrees Fahrenheit. As a harsh winter arrives, the Biden administration has failed to address the skyrocketing heating prices that are set to affect people across the en-tirety of the Commonwealth of Penn-sylvania. In the past year, the price of fuel oil has risen 86 percent. This is the direct result of President Biden's decision to implement Green New Deal initiatives instead of using the energy that is under the feet of my constituents, the coal, the oil, the Marcellus shale, and the natural gas that are in Pennsyl-vania and that can help drive down the prices this winter. It is time to enact commonsense per- mitting reforms. It is time to return to American energy dominance, instead of using taxpayer dollars to subsidize windmills and solar panels that fail to produce the baseload power that Amer-icans want and, right now, facing win-ter, that Americans need. f RECOGNIZING SENIOR MASTER SERGEANT PAIGE FLAHERTY (Ms. HOULAHAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Senior Master Sergeant Paige Flaherty, who for the past year has joined my office as a VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:39 Dec CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 HOUSE H8676 December 1, 2022 member of the Air Force's legislative fellowship program. Paige embodies some of the best qualities of our forces, and indeed, of our Nation. Her tireless work with my team these past 11 months has revealed not only the immense depth of her commit-ment to public service, but also her in-telligence, her kindness, and her grit. I am grateful for her leadership and in-sight, which I have relied upon time and time again as we have worked to-gether to advocate for military fami-lies and those who serve in uniform. Although I am extremely sad to see her leave my staff and resume her work in the Air Force, I appreciate all she has done as part of my team. Thank you, Paige. f CELEBRATING THE 96TH BIRTH- DAY OF PLACENTIA, CALIFORNIA (Mrs. KIM of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. KIM of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today to join our amaz-ing city of Placentia and the residents that live in it and the entire commu-nity in California's 39th Congressional District as we celebrate the city's 96th birthday. ''Placentia'' is derived from the Latin word meaning ''pleasant place to live,'' and it certainly fulfills its name. Placentia is home to beautiful neigh-borhoods, good schools, stately church-es, and endless outdoor recreation. Our fast-growing community of 45,000 residents is tight-knit, hardworking, and dedicated to giving back. Some of my fondest memories include the city's concerts in the park, the annual Love Placentia event, and the always-lively Tamale Festival. I am honored to represent Placentia in Congress and will do all I can to en-sure our community continues to thrive. Happy birthday, Placentia. f PAYING TRIBUTE TO MARGARET ''PEGGY'' PALMER (Ms. DEAN asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a devoted community leader and friend, Margaret ''Peggy'' Palmer, who passed away on October 27. A native of Willow Grove, Pennsyl- vania, Peggy gave her time, her en-ergy, and her love to our community in Montgomery County. She was guided by her strong faith and was a committed member of the First Baptist Church of Crestmont. She was also a guiding light for civic en-gagement, serving as a committee per-son with the ARDC. Peggy was a re-lentless volunteer for Democratic can-didates that began when she volun-teered with her beloved mother, Lil-lian, for President Obama's 2008 cam- paign. She also worked as court crier and served as a member of the Willow Grove NAACP. No matter the role, Peggy worked harder than anyone, always with her signature kindness, humility, Jolly Ranchers, and red lipstick. She greeted everyone the same, with a hug and a kiss and ''hey, baby.'' She was loved by her family. Until the day she died, Peggy cared for her whole family, especially her dear brother, Johnny. I join Johnny and the rest of our community in mourning her passing. Her legacy lives on in the lives of the people she inspired, including me. f HONORING ROBIN REED (Mr. CLINE asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great Virginian, WDBJ7's legendary meteorologist, Robin Reed, as Reed recently an-nounced his well-deserved retirement from local news. Since graduating from James Madi- son University in 1978, Reed pursued a career in local journalism. Forty of his 44 years in the business have been at WDBJ7 out of Roanoke. Even though weathermen take undeserved hits for nasty weather fore-casts, Reed's long-running weather re-ports were a favorite of the commu-nity, sunshine, rain, or snow. Additionally, Reed teaches as a pro- fessor of practice at Virginia Tech School of Communication, a position he will continue in, preparing the next generation to improve their commu-nication skills for the betterment of society. Reed is also a devout family man, as his children remember him regularly coming to big events in their lives, from marching band performances to camping in the Adirondacks with the Scouts. Among numerous journalistic accom- plishments, Reed received the Citizen of the Year Award in Media from the Roanoke branch of the NAACP and was honored as a favorite member of the Virginia Tech faculty after being nomi-nated by numerous students. I join countless Roanoke Valley resi- dents and viewers in wishing Reed a great retirement and thank him for his lasting contributions to local jour-nalism. f REMEMBERING DR. NOA EMMETT ALULI (Mr. KAHELE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. KAHELE. Madam Speaker, it is with deep sadness that I stand before you to share the passing of one of Ha-waii's most beloved individuals, my friend and mentor, Dr. Noa Emmett Aluli. Uncle Emmett, as many affection- ately called him, dedicated his life to the health and well-being of Native Ha-waiians. He graduated from the University of Hawaii and later opened and practiced at Molokai Family Health Center and Clinic. He helped draft the Native Ha-waiian Health Care Improvement Act that was signed into law in 1988 to im-prove the health status of Native Ha-waiians and cofounded Na Pu'uwai, the Native Hawaiian Health Care System that serves the island of Molokai. Dr. Aluli also served as a member of the Second Congressional District's Native Hawaiian Health Task Force, helping set Federal policies to advance Native Hawaiian healthcare. Uncle Emmett leaves an indelible mark on the hearts of the people of Ha-waii, and his contributions will be felt for generations. He will be greatly missed by his family and his beloved people of Molokai. f MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Ms. Byrd, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has passed without amend-ment a bill of the House of the fol-lowing title: H.R. 2220. An act to amend title 40, United States Code, to modify the treatment of cer-tain bargain-price options to purchase at less than fair market value, and for other pur-poses. The message also announced that the Senate has agreed to without amend-ment a concurrent resolution of the House of the following title: H. Con. Res. 118. Concurrent Resolution au- thorizing the use of the rotunda of the Cap-itol for a ceremony to present Congressional Gold Medals to the United States Capitol Po-lice and others who protected the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The message also announced that the Senate has passed bills of the following titles in which the concurrence of the House is requested: S. 1466.

VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:32 December 1, 2022 b1215 CONGRATULATING RICH FELTS ON HIS RETIREMENT (Mr. MANN asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great Kansan, Rich Felts, and to congratulate him on his retirement from a career of service to Kansas farmers, ranchers, and agri-cultural producers. Rich has always been a tireless advo- cate for agriculture. He earned his de-gree in animal science from Kansas State University, after which he began his service to Kansas Farm Bureau at the county level, holding many dif-ferent leadership and volunteer posi-tions. Now, after having served as the president of Kansas Farm Bureau for 8 years, Rich will be retiring on Decem-ber 5. As a partner in Felts Farms, a grain and livestock operation near Liberty, Kansas, Rich has been through it all, and he brought his firsthand experience with him to Kansas Farm Bureau, where he never failed to empathize with local producers. Congratulations on a job well done, Rich. Thank you for stewarding the legacy of Kansas Farm Bureau so well. I know that Shirley and your children, Cynthia, Darren, Ryan, and Kimberly are so proud of you. Your leadership has been an inspiration and a model to us all. Congratulations. f LUNG CANCER SCREENING SAVES LIVES (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speaker, lung cancer is the deadliest form of cancer in the United States, yet only 6 percent of people eligible get screened, and that number decreases among underserved populations. Prevention and early detection are the best protections against lung can-cer. That is why we have introduced the Increasing Access to Lung Cancer Screening Act. This bill expands cov-erage for and improves access to lung cancer screening. It also provides new coverage for tobacco cessation, as smoking is a major cause of lung can-cer. Our bill builds on the work of Buf- falo's Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. I ask my colleagues to join me and Representative C ASTOR in supporting this legislation that will en-hance the goals set through the Presi-dent's Cancer Moonshot to save lives and end cancer as we know it. f BIDEN SOUTHERN BORDER CRISIS (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, Biden and Democrats have failed to secure the southern border. Since Biden took office, over 1 million illegal aliens have evaded apprehen-sion, including 60,000 in October. Among the 4 million who have ille- gally crossed the border since Biden are professional mass murderers on the terrorist screening database. American families are at greater risk than ever of mass murder, which is why voters elected a Republican House majority to fight for effective border enforcement. As the co-chair of the French-Amer- ican Caucus and of French heritage myself, I was grateful yesterday to have been present with President Em-manuel Macron at the Library of Con-gress. South Carolina appreciates both the Marquis de Lafayette, who landed at Georgetown in 1777 to support the American Revolution, with his portrait here in the Chamber, and Michelin Tire Corporation, whose Lexington groundbreaking I attended this week in 1979, now the largest Michelin manu-facturing facility in the world. In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected America for 20 years, as the global war on ter-rorism, sadly which continues, now moving from the Afghanistan safe haven to America. f CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF DEBRA WALKER (Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of the life of my dear friend Debra Walker, who has recently gained her wings. Debra was one of the most thought- ful, kindest human beings. She was an artist, crafter, poet, and spoken word performer. She founded and led Power in Poetry Experience of Detroit, served as their treasurer and on the boards of many local nonprofits, and traveled the world training people on cost reduction methods. She was a loving mother, grand- mother, neighbor, and community member. My sons have always known her as Gabriel's grandmother. Debra would always show up for any- one, and she did it with her full, au-thentic self. I am sending her daughters, grandbabies, and family prayers of strength. We will miss Debra. f CONGRATULATING DR. TONY BRANNON ON HIS RETIREMENT (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Dr. Tony Brannon on his well-deserved retirement. Dr. Brannon grew up on a small fam- ily farm and at an early age began to participate in the Future Farmers of America events. His dedication to the FFA program and agricultural commu-nity would only grow. He completed a bachelor's degree in agricultural education from Murray State in 1981, a master's degree in 1982, and a Ph.D. at Oklahoma State Univer-sity in 1988. Dr. Brannon's heart never left Mur- ray State, though. Legend has it he even wrote in soap on his bathroom mirror ''MSU'' as a reminder of his goal to come back to Murray State. He returned to Murray State as a fac- ulty member in agricultural education and mechanization. In 2005, he was named the dean of the School of Agri-culture. For nearly 35 years, he has molded a generation of new agricul-tural leaders in Kentucky. As many gather to celebrate Dr. Brannon's retirement, I thank him for his commitment to the MSU commu-nity, service to the Kentucky FFA Foundation, and unwavering passion for helping thousands of students achieve their dreams. f PROTECTING THE PLANET FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS (Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the climate cri-sis and clean energy investments we need to continue as we double down on the work we started this Congress to protect a planet of clean air and clean water for future generations. During the district work period, I hosted a conference on climate action and clean energy at Olin College of En-gineering in Needham, Massachusetts. Across three panels of experts, we cov-ered policy and industry, clean energy science and technology, and inter-national affairs. Despite the challenges we discussed, I am optimistic. There is growing polit-ical will, abundant talent and innova-tion, and increasing global cooperation around the imperative of a clean en-ergy transition. Next Congress we must build on that political will in order to achieve a fu-ture of clean air, clean water, and clean energy that is too cheap to meter. f HONORING THE LIFE OF DANIEL WHEAT (Mr. STAUBER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Daniel Wheat, a young man from Duluth, Min-nesota, who recently passed away. When Daniel was born, doctors told his parents that he would never walk or talk, but he proved them wrong. While Daniel happened to have been born with Down syndrome, he didn't let VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:32 HOUSE H8678 December 1, 2022 it stop him from living his life to the fullest and bringing happiness to every-one around him. Daniel lived a life filled with service to the Duluth community. His warm heart and sense of humor brought end-less joy to his family, friends, and any-one else who was lucky enough to have met him. From playing the drums and cymbals in Duluth East High School's band to winning gold, silver, and bronze medals in powerlifting for Team USA at the International Special Olympic Games, Daniel lived every day to the fullest. We should all work to embody a per-spective like Daniel's by living each day to its highest potential. Daniel Wheat was an inspiration to his family, and our entire community is better off because he was in our lives. I pray that God watches over the Wheat family as they grieve and re-member him. f CORPORATE CRIME DATABASE IS CRITICAL (Ms. SCANLON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, this week I proudly joined Senator D URBIN and Senator B LUMENTHAL in intro- ducing the Corporate Crime Database Act, bicameral legislation that re-quires the Department of Justice to collect, aggregate, analyze, and publish comprehensive data on Federal cor-porate criminal enforcement actions. While the Department of Justice reg- ularly collects data on nearly every type of street-level crime, there is cur-rently very little reporting of cor-porate and white-collar crimes. A Federal corporate crime database is critical to bolstering corporate crime law enforcement and holding wrongdoers accountable. But the last thorough DOJ report on corporate crime was in 1979. Without data or transparency, law- makers, journalists, and the public are left in the dark about the size and scope of corporate crime in America and the effectiveness of the Federal Government's response. By requiring the DOJ to collect and analyze information regarding enforce-ment actions, publish a database of the enforcement actions, and submit an an-nual report to Congress, the Corporate Crime Database Act will deter future crimes and protect victims. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this commonsense legislation to curtail corporate crime. f REMEMBERING DR. GLENN BLODGETT (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to re-member the life and the legacy of Dr. Glenn Blodgett, known to most as Doc Blodgett. Doc Blodgett passed away at the age of 73 on November 21, sur-rounded by loved ones. Doc Blodgett spent more than 40 years managing the horse division at the Four Sixes Ranch in Texas. Blodgett led the ranch's team of veteri-nary staff. He oversaw all veterinary practices and reproductive services, in-cluding horse breeding. Nearly 1,500 mares were bred from the ranch each year. Outside of his work at the Four Sixes Ranch, Doc served on the board of the American Association of Equine Prac-titioners and in 2019 was inducted into the Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame. Earlier this year, I had the great privilege of traveling to the Four Sixes Ranch and interacting with Doc Blodgett and the legendary horse pro-gram at the ranch. One thing was clear during the visit, Doc Blodgett was in-credibly passionate about his work. He was a master of his practice and some-one who left an irreplaceable mark on the equine industry. Doc Blodgett is survived by his lov- ing wife of more than 50 years, Karen Wright, his two daughters, four grand-daughters, and one grandson. Madam Speaker, please join me in keeping Karen, the Blodgett family, and Doc Blodgett's friends in your prayers. f REMEMBERING FELIPE VALLS (Mr. GIMENEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss and honor the incredible life of Mr. Felipe Valls. Felipe Valls was a giant of the Cuban exile community in Miami and founded the iconic Versailles Restaurant in Lit-tle Havana. Valls was born in Santiago de Cuba in 1933. He attended the prestigious Riverside Military Academy in Georgia and returned to his hometown after graduating in 1950. When he was 27 years old, Valls escaped the Com-munist revolution with his wife and two children. In Miami, he found work in the res- taurant business; first as a busboy, and then at a restaurant equipment com-pany. He then opened International Equipment Company, which sold res-taurant equipment such as refrigera-tion, air conditioners, and espresso ma-chines that he imported from Europe. It was at this time that Valls in- vented the ventanita, the now ubiq-uitous window stands where locals gather for their morning shot of Cuban coffee. In 1971, Valls opened Versailles Restaurant on Calle Ocho. Today, it is the most famous Cuban restaurant in Miami and possibly the world. Versailles is a culinary, social, and cultural landmark in Miami. It has served delicious Cuban pastries, sand-wiches, and cafecitos for more than 50 years. It is one of the first places that any visitor to Miami will go, and three U.S. Presidents have eaten there. In Felipe Valls' own words, Versailles ''is where you come to take the pulse of our community . . . Versailles is the Cuban exile that refuses to kneel down.'' I believe that Versailles is the heart of the Cuban exile community in Miami. Felipe is survived by his loving chil- dren and grandchildren, who continue his family's proud legacy. His long life reflected those of so many hardworking Cuban exiles who built a new commu-nity in Miami. He will be missed. May he rest in peace. f CONGRATULATING LEANDREA MIKELL (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate LeAndrea Mikell, the executive direc-tor for government and community en-gagement at Savannah State Univer-sity for making the annual Georgia Trend 40 under 40 list. LeAndrea grew up in Hardeeville, South Carolina, right on the other side of the river from Savannah. Though she didn't grow up in Savannah proper, LeAndrea lives and breathes our city. She began her professional life in the city as a student at Savannah State University, where she interned for the Savannah Area Chamber of Commerce, then went on to work for the Savannah Morning News, then to the World Trade Center in Savannah, then back to her alma mater. Today, LeAndrea works with stu- dents, residents, and elected officials to provide better opportunities for young people across the region to pre-pare them for the success they deserve. It is citizens like LeAndrea who make Savannah the tight-knit commu-nity it is. We are so lucky to have such talented people like her working to se-cure a better and brighter future for the students in our city. I thank Georgia Trend for including her in its 40 under 40 list, and to thank LeAndrea for the important work that she does for her university and for our city. f b1230 HONORING FRANK SCHIEFELBEIN, JR. (Mrs. FISCHBACH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of a staple in Minnesota's farm community, Frank Schiefelbein. Frank passed away earlier this week on his beloved farm. Frank, better known as ''Big Frank,'' led a life centered around faith, family, VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:32 Dec HOUSE H8679 December 1, 2022 farming, friends, and food. He started his Angus herd, now the largest in the State, in the late 1950s with the mis-sion of making the perfect steak. He met his wife, Frosty, when he was only 16 years old. Through their 69 years of marriage, they raised 9 sons and have 32 grandchildren and 31 great- grandchildren to carry on his legacy. He truly left an impression on every- one he met, and he will be greatly missed by everyone. f ABOLISH THE DEATH PENALTY (Ms. BUSH asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. BUSH. Madam Speaker, St. Louis and I rise today to remind my colleagues that there is no place in a humane society for State-sanctioned violence. On Tuesday, Kevin ''KJ'' Johnson was taken from his family by capital punishment. From the systemic racism that tainted his conviction and the State's continuing use of executions to the Missouri Supreme Court's and the U.S. Supreme Court's denial of a stay of execution, KJ was failed by our criminal legal system. Missouri intends to move forward with the executions of four more people in the coming months. Congress must act. Congress must pass legislation to abolish the Federal death penalty and encourage States to follow suit. I am also urging our President to continue leading on this issue and act now. Commute the sentences of all those on Federal death row, condemn State executions, and urge his adminis-tration, this administration, to stop seeking the death penalty. Let's abol-ish the death penalty once and for all. f CONGRATULATING ANDALE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM (Mr. ESTES asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and congratulate the Andale High School Indians on their 2022 Class 3A football State cham-pionship, their fourth in a row. Since 2019, Coach Dylan Schmidt and the class of 2022 have shown the State and country that the hard work and dedication they put into the game are unmatched on the field. With their win last Saturday, Andale continued its 4-year undefeated streak of 51 games, the second-longest active win streak in the entire country. To put this in perspective, the seniors at Andale High School have never lost a high school football game. During this impressive run, Andale has outscored their opponents by an average of more than 45 points per game. Coach Schmidt and his team now hold the record for the fourth- longest winning streak in Kansas State history. In a testament to their talent and Coach Schmidt's commitment to excel-lence, the team has only lost twice since 2017. I hope the entire House will join me in congratulating Andale High School and Coach Schmidt on their monu-mental achievements on the field and off the field. I wish them continued success in their upcoming season. Go Indians. f HONORING THE SERVICE OF COLONEL BUD ANDERSON (Mr. M CCLINTOCK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, whether in 60 seconds or 60 hours, it is impossible to do justice to the heroism, patriotism, and service that defines the life of Colonel Bud Anderson. He flew 116 fighter combat missions over Europe in World War II, shot down more than 16 enemy aircraft, and was decorated 25 times, including two Le-gions of Merit, five Distinguished Fly-ing Crosses, the Bronze Star, 16 air medals, the French Legion of Honor, and the French Croix de Guerre. Chuck Yeager called him a ''mon- goose'' and ''the best fighter pilot I have ever seen.'' After distinguished service in Korea and Vietnam, he managed McDonnell Douglas' legendary flight facility at Edwards Air Force Base. He is still going strong at the age of 100, and today, I am pleased to an-nounce, at the request of Congressman L AMALFA and myself, that the Air Force has just promoted him to the rank of Brigadier General, effective De-cember 14. God bless you, General Anderson. Congratulations, and thank you on be-half of a grateful Nation. f RESTORING AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE (Mr. CLYDE asked and was given per- mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, over the weekend, the White House eased sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector, permitting Chevron to resume oil pro-duction in the communist regime. This policy follows an undeniable pattern of the President putting our Nation last. Joe Biden is more than happy to green-light drilling in Venezuela but stalls drilling permits here in the United States. He is delighted to beg foreign adversaries like Saudi Arabia to boost production but refuses to un-leash American energy. The President is determined to advance Green New Deal policies but fails to help Ameri-cans struggling to fill their gas tanks and heat their homes this winter. Make no mistake: This is the Amer- ica last administration. You see, Presi-dent Biden wants to totally control U.S. fossil fuel energy, and he can do it more easily through manipulating im-ports of foreign oil than he can over do-mestic production once it has begun. It is a nefarious plan. Thankfully, though, in just a few short weeks, House Republicans will retake the majority and start advanc-ing legislation to restore American en-ergy independence once and for all. f WORLD AIDS DAY (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, today is World AIDS Day, and lest we forget, it is not over yet. In 2021, 1.5 million persons became in- fected with AIDS and 600,000 died; a pandemic or an epidemic. As we fought and scurried to save lives against COVID-19, let us not forget. I rise to thank all the AIDS advocacy groups and my particular center, the Thomas Street Clinic, which will hold a World AIDS Day ceremony today, one that I never miss except when in Washington. I remember the days of standing at the bedsides of those who were dying alone. We must continue to research, we must continue to acknowledge, and we must continue to eliminate the stigma, for all of those infected and af-fected AIDS must have human dignity. I am reminded of my early engage- ment standing with the late Senator Orrin Hatch and, of course, the late Senator Ted Kennedy when they an-nounced the Ryan White CARE Treat-ment Act, and what an amazing im-pact. We have lost many souls. Many fami- lies have suffered, but as Americans, let us continue to fight against the scourge of AIDS and to embrace those who are fighting and living with AIDS. World AIDS Day. We should never forget. It is not over yet. f ONE STOP SHOP COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAM ACT OF 2021 Ms. JACKSON LEE.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-bers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their re-marks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3372. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentle-woman from Texas? There was no objection. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Madam Speaker, H.R. 3372, the One Stop Shop Community Reentry Pro-gram Act of 2021, is truly a public safe-ty-minded bill that would create a grant program within the Department of Justice to support community re-entry intake and coordination centers. The centralized centers opened pur- suant to this bill would offer those leaving incarceration the resources necessary to successfully rejoin and re-integrate into our communities through DOJ and community-funded reentry programs. Now, let me be very clear: I am de- lighted that there are the kind of sen-sitive community efforts across Amer-ica, spotty in different States and dif-ferent cities, who believe in reentry. That is why we believe this legislation is so important, because it federalizes and increases the opportunity for all Americans facing the daunting respon-sibilities of what reentry is to have a lifeline. There exists a great need for these programs envisioned in this legislation as more than 600,000 people return to their communities each year after serving time in State and Federal pris-ons, as do nearly 9 million people from county jails, while more than 2.5 mil-lion people complete parole and proba-tion. We can't deny these people an oppor- tunity to be again contributing citi-zens in a positive way. Individuals with criminal convictions face daunting challenges upon release. The overwhelming majority of those released from custody receive min-imum preparation during their incar-ceration and inadequate assistance to get back on their feet after they are re-leased. Their convictions may limit employ- ment prospects, educational and train-ing opportunities, public housing as-sistance, and access to social services. They should not, but they do. Even a minor criminal conviction can erect substantial barriers and trig-ger far-reaching collateral con-sequences, maybe even access to col-lege education. Due in part to the difficulty of over- coming these barriers, five out of six people who have spent time in a State prison will be arrested for a new crime within 9 years of their release. We cannot waste human resources or talent in this way. That is why policies designed to improve reentry outcomes have broad bipartisan support, as dem-onstrated by the passage of our First Step Act and the Sentencing Reduction Act, which incentivizes education and recidivism reduction programs for peo-ple in Federal prisons. While the First Step Act and Second Chance Act, first introduced by my good friend, D ANNY DAVIS, and other initiatives have been successful at the Federal level, the majority of return-ing citizens are exiting State and local facilities, and there is no overall and comprehensive effort to address the challenges of reentry. An example of the type of commu- nity reentry center supported by this legislation is in Tulsa, Oklahoma, VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:32 Dec HOUSE H8682 December 1, 2022 where community organizations offer a comprehensive model of reentry serv-ices. The services offered through the Tulsa Reentry One-Stop have signifi-cantly reduced recidivism and in-creased employment. In 2015, 77 percent of the individuals who successfully completed their reintegration program remained employed after exiting the program. There is the proof. H.R. 3372 would establish a grant pro- gram to support reentry centers like Tulsa and ensure support is more avail-able for all individuals across the Na-tion from the moment they are re-leased. Support would include assist-ance with transportation, housing, skills training, and even advanced edu-cation. One-stop reentry centers would also assist reentering individuals in obtain-ing identification and applying for eli-gible public benefits. Those who have formal reentry plans would be able to find case management assistance and court-directed wraparound support at the reentry centers. This, again, would be a lifeline for a new direction, not for the individual only, but for their family, their neigh-bors, their neighborhood, and where they live. In addition to the one-stop reentry centers, this bill would authorize a sec-ond mechanism to assist individuals re-entering communities that do not have large enough populations of reentering individuals to maintain a standalone reentry center. In these communities, H.R. 3372 would provide grants to oper-ate free reentry hotlines that operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to assist those recently released from incarcer-ation with reentry services near their homes. Madam Speaker, the Judiciary Com- mittee has a responsibility not to look only at urban crises, urban crime, and urban solutions. We must look at the hamlets, villages, suburbia, and else-where. Rural communities need our as-sistance. We specifically thought it was impor- tant to have this hotline to be able to assist them. This element of the bill is particularly important in our smaller communities. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle might argue that the funding authorized in the bill is too high, but we know that the high rates of recidivism equal this amount of money, leaving individuals coming out of incarceration as having nowhere to go. b1245 Their actions can become more cost- ly to Americans than our investment in changing their lives. This bill would address a pressing na- tionwide need, providing individuals with the tools and support they need to successfully reenter society, ulti-mately making our community safer. Now, I have had the privilege of serv- ing alongside of Representative K AREN BASSfor a number of years. I take this moment to publicly, on behalf of her colleagues, congratulate her for her next step in life: Becoming the first woman to ever become mayor of the great city of LA. I can say that because there is an- other great city, Houston. But I give her my congratulations and I know her colleagues would do so, as well. Representative B ASS worked with leadership on this issue, as well as join-ing with bipartisan cosponsors. We know it has widespread support and, therefore, we are looking forward to in-troducing this important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal- ance of my time. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Madam Speaker, H.R. 3372 authorizes the Attorney General to provide grants to community-based nonprofits to op-erate one stop reentry centers. The biggest problem, though, is the Department of Justice already does ex-actly what this bill would require it to do. The Second Chance Act of 2007, reau- thorized by Congress and signed into law by President Trump in the First Step Act of 2018, provides comprehen-sive assistance to individuals in transi-tion from prison back to the commu-nity. This bill is duplicative. It is re-dundant, and maybe, most impor-tantly, the Democrats know that. Last Congress, the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Secu-rity held a hearing. The majority's own briefing memo for that hearing high-lighted the reporting center in Som-erset County, Pennsylvania. And the center said this: It was a community- based correctional program that has been designed to provide services for its participants at one location. This is the exact type of program outlined in H.R. 3372. And indeed the center's program received a grant from the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Assistance. In fact, the name of that grant is Smart Supervision: Reducing Prison Populations, Saving Money, and Cre-ating Safer Communities. H.R. 3372 is duplicative of efforts found in the Second Chance Act under which nonprofit entities are eligible for grant funds. While we want successful reentry programs to reduce recidivism, we should not be creating duplicative and additional bureaucracy in the proc-ess. Also, the bill encourages State, In- dian Tribes, and local governments to employ sex offenders, murderers, and human traffickers, and other dan-gerous criminals to operate the reentry service assistance hotlines. H.R. 3372 authorizes $7.5 million in grants to States, Indian Tribes, and local governments to operate these re-entry service assistance hotlines that direct individuals to local reentry serv-ices. It requires the Attorney General to give preference to applicants who would employ people to operate the hotlines, ''who have been convicted of an offense or have served a term of im-prisonment and have completed any court-ordered supervision. But the bill provides no exceptions for violent of-fenders, such as sex offenders, mur-derers, human traffickers, and other dangerous criminals. While it might be appropriate to em- ploy certain offenders who have dem-onstrated full rehabilitation, Congress should not be incentivizing local com-munities to hire certain offenders who may not have been rehabbed. What should we be doing? Spending our time, our limited time, in address-ing the rampant crime epidemic in America. Cities are rejecting lenient, soft-on-crime policies and encouraging prosecutors to actually enforce the law. Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal- ance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, my dear friend, Ranking Member J OR- DAN, speaks to a particular point that I just have to respond. I am so glad he cited positive exam- ples of what a reentry program can do, but he is giving evidence, comfort, and advocacy for this legislation. Because isolated programs will not help Ameri-cans. We now give a broad-based oppor-tunity for cities, hamlets, villages, and counties across America\u2014rural and urban, North, South, East and West\u2014to look at their landscape of those reen-tering and accessing this one-stop pro-gram. We have already said 600,000 are re- leased, and we have already said that these persons want to rehabilitate themselves. Why would anybody oppose this legislation? And it is bipartisan. Let me remind my friends that these are individuals who have served their time. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. C ICILLINE ), a distinguished member of the committee and the subcommittee chair. Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3372, the One Stop Shop Community Reentry Pro-gram Act. Every year, more than 600,000 people in the United States are released from State and Federal prisons. But even after they are released, in many ways their sentences continue. Criminal records create unbelievable barriers to securing housing, edu-cation, employment, healthcare, and other basic necessities. And there is no Federal agency currently responsible for helping newly released people to navigate these issues. This bill provides much-needed fund- ing for the creation of a community- based solution to help formerly incar-cerated people access vital services that will help them return to their VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:57 Dec H8683 December 1, 2022 families and neighborhoods success- fully. As mayor of the city of Providence, I assembled a reentry council to support similar reentry programs in the city. I witnessed firsthand how such services deliver desperately needed support and effectively reduced an individual's re-offending and thereby making our com-munities safer and more prosperous. That is why I am proud to support this legislation. I am confident it will help people who are exiting the crimi-nal justice system effectively get back on their feet. I thank Congresswoman and future Los Angeles mayor, K AREN BASS for her great leadership on this bipartisan, bicameral bill, and on so many other important issues facing our country. Madam Mayor, you will be sorely missed in this Chamber and for your work in the Committees on the Judici-ary and Foreign Affairs. Madam Speaker, I urge my col- leagues to support this bill today. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. M CCLINTOCK ), a respected member of the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I voted for this bill in committee be-cause it is a worthy objective. Assisting prisoners to successfully reenter society, find jobs, and take their place as law-abiding citizens is essential to the safety and stability of our society. But on further reflection, I have come to believe that this is a program that the Federal Government should not be funding through grants to local organizations. Grants have become the third biggest expenditure of the entire Federal Gov-ernment, behind only Social Security and National Defense. We give away a half-trillion dollars a year in this manner, that is roughly $4,000 from an average family's taxes, with little oversight, little account-ability, little follow-up, and little re-sults. Reentry preparation should be a top priority of Federal and State prison systems. State prisons are a State re-sponsibility. They should be funded by taxpayers of the individual States. Pro-bation departments exist precisely to promote reentry, and the model in this bill should be considered by them. Now, Federal prisons are our respon- sibility, and we also have probation services that should be striving toward implementing concepts in this bill. If this measure funded Federal pro- grams that expanded reentry prepara-tion within the Federal prisons and probation system, I would strongly support it, but it doesn't. Instead, it takes the money of a taxpayer in one State and throws that money at a non-profit organization in another State with the hope that some good will come from it. And some might. But more likely, it will disappear into the salaries of various groups who will write glowing reports of their work and apply for more grants next year. And if for some reason the Fed-eral Bureau of Prisons is unable to pro-vide these services, then they should be competitively bid out to contractors with specific performance measure-ments and accountability. Federal grant spending is completely out of control and it has to stop. Reck-less spending\u2014all for good causes\u2014I have never seen a grant program that doesn't promise to do good things, but it is destroying our prosperity. That spending is driving the worst inflation in 40 years and the most ruinous debt in our Nation's history. And it is hard to find a grant program that actually delivers on its promises. I think it is time that we began to spend taxpayers' money as carefully as they spend what they have got left after we have taxed them into debt. This bill falls short of that responsi- bility. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. There lies the key element to my friends who are ignoring the fact that this one-stop legislation has bi-partisan support. It means that some-one who was in opposition to my party, my caucus, supports this. The work that Ms. B ASSdid with all of us was a bipartisan effort. And the reason is be-cause this is an investment. And my friends keep talking about grants. And so it is the grant that con-tinues to be the line of argument and the\u2014how should I say it\u2014the bee sting. And they are wrong because grants have oversight. Grants require these organizations to apply and present the best practices, the best evidence. And so I am very glad that it is a grant. But it also gives those with broad needs across the land the fair opportunity to apply for a grant to be able to have these kinds of programs. The one-stop model that this legisla- tion promotes would aim to provide complete reentry services to address the critical elements of the reentry process that promote long-term re-entry success, which as I said, is hous-ing, employment, education, and healthcare. The bill will ensure that returning citizens can effectively access the serv-ices funded through the many bills that we have tried to work on. Now let me just be very clear. One of my good friends called off a list of of-fenders that really triggers fear, appre-hension, and distaste. Well, those are the very individuals that we would hope that through treatment, medical care and otherwise, and getting them into a proper program, that they can be contributing, that their families do not have to be fearfully looking over their shoulder as to what have they done next. We have to try. And these programs will hire those who have a difficult time finding employment. But you can be assured that working with the program they will be screened prior to their employment; their employ-ment will reduce their likelihood to recidivate. Mr. Speaker, I think it is extremely important that we take the tough questions and give good answers. Tough questions about: What do you do with those who are trying to reenter? What you do is you have a good pro-gram that is tough and that it works. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I would just point out there is nothing in the bill that requires that you screen these individuals. It says you are supposed to hire these folks with that past criminal record to answer the hotlines. That is what the bill says. If you want to amend it to say no, that they have to be screened even more before you let them answer the phones, that is not what the legislation says. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, just in a moment let me indicate that you can always find just a sliver on which to oppose. I hold in my hand a whole list of Re- publicans that believe the bill works and should work. So that, we should take off the table. Republicans and Democrats support this legislation. And then I can assure you that peo- ple answering the phone will not be randomly answering the phone. They will be under a supervised program, as this program relates. We would hope and expect that they would be the kind that can listen and take the intake of those who are desperate and trying to find a way not to go back to crime. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak- ers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Again, I would just point out that that is not what the legislation says. It says the Attorney General shall give preference for hiring folks, that I de-scribed in my opening statement, to answer these hotlines. So what the gentlewoman from Texas, my friend, said is just not accu-rate. It doesn't reflect what is in the bill itself. That's not the first thing she said today that is not accurate. Earlier, the gentlewoman made a statement. I wrote it down: Isolated programs will not help Americans. How do you know? b1300 Which isolated programs are you talking about? I assume you were talking about the one I referenced in Pennsylvania that is doing exactly the same thing this bill seeks to do. Have you checked that program out? If they don't help Americans, then whom do they help? Are they helping illegal immigrants? I don't know. Again, all I am saying is it is impor- tant when we have these debates we stick to the facts. VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:57 Dec HOUSE H8684 December 1, 2022 For the reasons I outlined before, Mr. Speaker, we oppose the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Mr. Speaker, I always like a words game with my good friend from Ohio, so let me clarify. An isolated program means that a program in Tulsa and a program in Pennsylvania do not help someone in Idaho. And so what this one-stop pro-gram does is it gives the good works of the people of Pennsylvania and Tulsa, it gives Americans the opportunities in cities, hamlets, urban centers, and rural hamlets the opportunity to have the same exact program and to invest in the 600,000, those who are coming out of incarceration, give them the same opportunity for ensuring that they will have that access to this pro-gram That is what our intent was on the Judiciary Committee, and that is what the intent was on the many individ-uals, if you will, who were trying to craft something that will work for all of America. Now, let me share with you, Mr. Speaker, an article titled: ''To keep people from returning to jail, Mesa County follows other communities' re-entry roadmap.'' Many people transitioning from jail or prison strug-gle to reenter society. So here is Mesa County's new program with housing, jobs, transportation, and mental health services. What we simply want to do is to get this program out. I will just share you with the story of Richard Gallegos who was locked up in the Mesa County jail for the first time at age 18. He spent the next 8 years in and out of jail\u2014typically drug- and al-cohol-related misdemeanors that some-times led to more serious incidents, in-cluding nonviolent domestic disputes and resisting arrest. He said that at 27 he was sentenced to prison for a drug and firearms violation. Altogether, Gallegos, was born and raised in Grand Junction and now 45 years old, has spent 5 years in State prison, and 3 years in county jail, and for the past 4 years he has been on pro-bation. He now works at a job where he is learning masonry, a switch from the oil and gas industry work he did pre-viously. ''I am staying honest, humble,'' he said. ''I try not to walk with too much shame. The best thing in my favor is I have been forgiven by those I have wronged. They understand my drug ad-diction.'' These are individuals whom we don't want to throw by the wayside. We want to make sure they get into this pro-gram. Mr. Speaker, I include this article in the R ECORD . [From the Colorado Sun, Nov. 8, 2022] TOKEEPPEOPLE FROM RETURNING TO JAIL, MESA COUNTY FOLLOWS OTHER COMMU - NITIES ' REENTRY ROADMAP (By Sharon Sullivan) Richard Gallegos was locked up in the Mesa County Jail for the first time at age 18. He spent the next eight years in and out of jail\u2014typically drug and alcohol-fueled mis-demeanors that sometimes led to more seri-ous incidents, including (nonviolent) domes-tic disputes and resisting arrest, he said. At 27, he was sentenced to prison for a drug and firearms violation. Altogether, Gallegos, born and raised in Grand Junction and now 45 years old, has spent five years in state prison and three years in county jail. For the past four years, he has been on probation. He now works at a job where he's learning masonry, a switch from the oil and gas industry work he did previously. ''I'm staying honest, humble,'' he said. ''I try not to walk with too much shame. The best thing in my favor is I have been for-given by those I've wronged. They under-stand drug addiction.'' Gallegos shares an apartment with an adult daughter, but many formerly incarcer-ated friends are not so lucky, he said. ''People are coming out of jail with no re- sources,'' Gallegos said. ''You better hope you have a support system. Resources are slim to none coming out of county jail. ''You're on your own, facing what put you in there in the first place. People's first thought is often, 'I want to do what's right\u2014 but where do I go?''' Mesa County officials have long recognized that many people transitioning from jail or prison struggle with substance abuse, mental illness or both\u2014compounding the multiple other challenges they face when reentering society, and often lacking much-needed re-sources like Gallegos did. The Mesa County Sheriff's Office compared names of frequent users of the jail with fre-quent visitors to emergency rooms at Grand Junction's two acute care hospitals, Commu-nity Hospital and St. Mary's Medical Center. (To protect patient privacy, the two hos-pitals did not disclose names, but confirmed that many people appeared on both lists.) They identified 60-90 frequent users of both the jail and emergency rooms. Most of these frequent users face challenges related to mental health diagnoses or substance abuse, said Mesa County Commissioner Janet Row-land, who has led an effort to address the issue. In September, Mesa County launched a new multiagency collaboration (county offi-cials refer to it as MAC), aimed at helping people successfully transition from incarcer-ation. The collaboration connects people to agencies that can assist with employment, housing, transportation and other basic needs, as well as access to mental health services or rehabilitation programs to com-bat drug or alcohol addictions. REENTERING SOCIETY In April 2021, 50 percent of people held in the Mesa County Jail were on mental health medications, Mesa County Sheriff Todd Rowell said. Mental health and/or substance abuse issues are a significant factor in re-cidivism rates at the jail, said Rowell. While people can receive treatment for these condi-tions while incarcerated, they often lack continuity of care once they leave jail and, thus, can be prone to reoffending, he said. In 2020, when overall arrests were down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, one man was ar-rested 19 times, Rowell noted. A dozen other people were arrested four to eight times each. ''I was frustrated. I felt people had almost zero chance to succeed after jail,'' Rowell said. ''Life is hard anyways, particularly after spending three months in jail. Finding work is almost impossible. It's a benefit to any county to understand those challenges to change the recidivism.'' Mesa County did not have a transition co- ordinator at its jail until it hired Julie Mamo in 2019. She visited jails in Boulder and Douglas counties to learn about their re-entry programs while creating Mesa Coun-ty's program. The new multiagency collabo-ration builds on the program Mamo founded. Thus far, Mesa County has enlisted three agencies to provide services to help people with reentry: Amos Counseling, a Grand Junction-based counseling service; Founda-tions 4 Life, an organization that provides substance use disorder and mental health services to people involved in the justice sys-tem; and the Freedom Institute, a nonprofit that offers WAGEES (Work and Gain Edu-cation and Employment Skills), a commu-nity reentry program within the Colorado Department of Corrections. The Freedom Institute has already been providing WAGEES services for prison parol-ees in Grand Junction. Its new county con-tract now allows the Freedom Institute to offer those same services to the jail popu-lation. Lisa Mills, Mesa County's behavioral health strategies manager, decides which agency can best meet the specific needs of a person leaving jail. Case managers are given no more than 10 clients\u2014the goal is to meet with people daily if necessary\u2014to ensure they are adhering to prescription medica-tions, able to access food assistance, acquire bus passes, find employment and housing. Upon release, people are met at the jail by an agency staff member for rides to where they are staying or wherever else they need to go. The agencies work closely with the jail's two transition coordinators. The county secured a $400,000 grant from the Colorado Department of Human Services' Office of Behavioral Health to fund the pro-gram. St. Mary's Medical Center and the Mesa County Sheriff's Office each pitched in another $300,000 for a total of $1 million. ''It's a long overdue program,'' said Lieu- tenant Henry Stoffel of the Mesa County Sheriff's Office. ''A lot of people leave our fa-cility and don't have basic human needs, and so they often reoffend. We want to get them out of that cycle.'' RETURNING TO PRISON FOR MINOR OFFENSES It's taken 45-year-old Gary Swenson 20 years to get out of that cycle. His involve-ment with the justice system began at age 12 when he was sentenced to a Colorado juve-nile detention center for a burglary he com-mitted with a relative and two friends. By age 18 he was addicted to methamphetamine. He has spent half his life in and out of state prison. Swenson said he found it challenging to meet his parole obligations without a reli-able source of transportation. Public transit didn't exist in the Grand Valley when he needed it, and he wasn't allowed to drive until he had fulfilled parole obligations. Em-ployers were annoyed that he asked to leave work a couple times each week to attend mandatory substance abuse classes. He also had to take time off to submit weekly urine samples for drug screenings\u2014which he was required to pay for himself, along with the classes. ''Your employer has to be real under- standing, which they're usually not,'' Swenson said. HOUSE H8685 December 1, 2022 He said most of his time behind bars was for parole violations, including once for re-ceiving a speeding ticket, or on other occa-sions for missing those classes\u2014all viola-tions for which he'd be sent right back to prison. ''It was always a prison sentence,'' as op- posed to probation or a halfway house, Swenson said. ProPublica (a national nonprofit media outlet that receives funding from The Colo-rado Trust) recently reported on how easy it is to be sent back to prison for minor of-fenses. The number of people in Colorado who return to prison within three years is 50 percent, one of the worst recidivism rates in the nation, according to a 2018 Virginia De-partment of Corrections report cited by ProPublica. Douglas County's reentry program in- cludes a jail medication-assisted treatment program that helps people with opioid use disorder. The county had a 42 percent recidi-vism rate in 2021, which is lower than the statewide average, said Nicole Beckett, the jail-based behavioral health services admin-istrator in Douglas County. Its reentry pro-gram includes working with probation offi-cers, pretrial officers, public defenders and community behavioral health professionals. ''It's definitely our goal to disrupt the cycle of incarceration,'' Beckett said. ''Peo-ple with substance use disorders face risk of relapse, making them a challenging popu-lation to help.'' Boulder County's reentry program added a housing coordinator, Kim Smith, in 2019 to focus specifically on helping people find housing in the city's extremely tight mar-ket. People on probation are prohibited from leaving Boulder County to seek more afford-able housing elsewhere. With such a com-petitive housing market, landlords can eas-ily choose not to rent to people with crimi-nal records, said Smith. The reentry pro-gram has seen an 80 percent success rate of people avoiding recidivism. Mesa County officials say reentry pro- grams are rare in rural areas due to a lack of resources. County Sheriffs of Colorado, a nonprofit that provides programs and sup-port to sheriffs statewide, does not track the number of counties offering transition pro-grams. While Mesa County Jail offers some pro- grams in-house, it needs more space, and continuity of care has been an issue once people leave jail, Stoffel said. He would like the jail's transition program to double or tri-ple in size, and said he expects reentry pro-grams to increase across Colorado. ''They're in treatment for 45 days; recov- ery is for life,'' Mamo said. READJUSTING TO LIFE In July, Mamo launched a program similar to one she witnessed in Douglas County that helps people acquire identification cards. A Department of Motor Vehicles mobile unit comes to the jail twice a month to issue IDs. ''Most people need two forms of ID,'' said Lory Villumsen, a second transition coordi-nator hired in June. ''We process the applica-tion to help with getting them their Social Security card.'' The transition team is addi-tionally working on finding birth certifi-cates for people. Mamo has created partnerships with tran- sitional sober living spaces, reunited people with family members who reside outside the community, and enrolled people in treat-ment programs\u2014sometimes out of town. The challenges of reentry are similar, whether transitioning from jail or prison, except lengthier prison sentences often means a per-son has become more ''institutionalized,'' making it more difficult to adjust to life on the outside, Mamo said. People who are incarcerated are told when to eat, when to sleep, what to wear and what to do; ''when people leave jail, we need to empower them to make all these decisions,'' Stoffel noted. Freedom Institute executive director Micah Espinoza hopes that working with people leaving county jail will keep them out of prison. ''Once you're convicted of a felony, and have fulfilled your sentence, you still pay for that the rest of your life,'' Espinoza said. As part of the multiagency collaboration, ''we're targeting people going in and out of jail for typically petty offenses. Why are they committing these crimes? It's usually poverty, homelessness, substance abuse, mental health.'' Swenson said he's learned from his mis- takes; he's been out of prison for almost two years and is on unsupervised probation for the first time. He works as a peer specialist for the Circle Program, a residential treat-ment program in Grand Junction for men age 18 and older with concurrent substance abuse and mental health disorders. ''There are people in this program I've been in prison with, gotten high with,'' Swenson said. ''They see 'if Gary can do it,' they can. It's me not forgetting where I came from. ''Instead of locking people up for posses- sion, give us an opportunity first to work with them,'' he continued. ''A lot of guys don't want to be high, live on the streets, be homeless\u2014it's just all they know. Being part of this program is a chance to see an oppor-tunity.'' Ms. JACKSON LEE. My concluding remarks include programs in Boulder County that can be done. Finally, Mr. Speaker, once you are convicted of a felony and have fulfilled your sentence, you will still pay for the rest of your life. We need to find a way where these individuals can contribute and not be those who enter out and then go in. It is important to learn from their mistakes, but we have got to help them. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the underlying legislation. Again, I thank those who cosponsored it and the main cosponsor, Congress-woman K AREN BASS. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3372, the ''One Stop Shop Community Reentry Program Act of 2021,'' is a public-safety minded bill that would create a grant program within the Department of Justice to support community reentry intake and coordination centers. The centralized centers opened pursuant to this bill would offer those leaving incarceration the resources necessary to successfully rejoin and reintegrate into our communities through DOJ and community-funded reentry programs. There exists a great need for the programs envisioned in this legislation, as more than 600,000 people return to their communities each year after serving time in state and fed-eral prisons, as do nearly nine million people from county jails, while more than 2.5 million people complete parole or probation each year. Individuals with criminal convictions face daunting challenges upon release. The over-whelming majority of those released from cus-tody receive minimal preparation during their incarceration and inadequate assistance to get back on their feet after they are released, while their convictions may limit employment prospects, educational and training opportuni-ties, public housing assistance, and access to social services. Even a minor criminal conviction can erect substantial barriers and trigger far-reaching collateral consequences. Due in part to the dif-ficulty of overcoming these barriers, five out of six people who have spent time in a state pris-on will be arrested for a new crime within nine years of their release. That is why policies designed to improve re- entry outcomes have broad bipartisan support, as demonstrated by passage of the First Step Act, which incentivizes education and recidi-vism-reduction programs for people in federal prisons. While the First Step Act, Second Chance Act, and other initiatives have been successful at the federal level, the majority of returning citizens are exiting state and local facilities, and there is an overall need for a more com-prehensive approach to address the chal-lenges of reentry. An example of the type of community re- entry center supported by this legislation is in Tulsa, Oklahoma where community organiza-tions offer a comprehensive model of reentry services. The services offered through the Tulsa Reentry One-Stop have significantly re-duced recidivism and increased employment. In 2015, 77% of the individuals who success-fully completed their reintegration program re-mained employed after exiting the program. H.R. 3372 would establish a grant program to support community reentry centers like the Tulsa Reentry One-Stop and ensure support is made available for all individuals the moment they are released. Support would include as-sistance with transportation, housing, and skills training. One Stop reentry centers would also assist reentering individuals in obtaining identification and applying for eligible public benefits. And those who have formal reentry plans would be able to find case management assistance and court directed, wrap-around support at the re-entry centers. In addition to the One Stop reentry centers, this bill would authorize a second mechanism to assist individuals reentering communities that do not have large enough populations of reentering individuals to maintain a standalone reentry center. In these communities, H.R. 3372 would pro- vide grants to operate free, reentry hotlines that operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to assist those recently released from incar-ceration with reentry services near their homes. This element of the bill is particularly important for rural and smaller communities. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle might argue that the funding author-ized in this bill is too high. But we know that the high rates of recidivism of individuals leav-ing incarceration are far more costly to Amer-ican communities. This bill would address a pressing nation- wide need, providing individuals with the tools and support they need to successfully reenter society, ultimately, making our communities safer. I thank our colleague, Representative K AREN BASS, for her leadership on this issue, as well as her bipartisan cosponsors, for introducing this important legislation, and I urge my col-leagues to support it. Recognizing the high rates of recidivism in our communities and the lack of access to re-entry resources, H.R. 3372 would establish a VerDate Sep 11 2014 H8686 December 1, 2022 new grant program within DOJ to support One Stop Community Reentry Centers. When individuals lack access to reentry services such as housing, job training, and mental health resources, they are more like to be rearrested and reincarcerated. This bill would improve public safety by reducing re-cidivism. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3372, the One Stop Shop Community Reentry Program Act of 2021. I am proud to support this bill and thank my good friend and fellow Californian Con-gresswoman B ASS for her leadership, and Chairman Nadler and the Speaker for bringing this important bill to the floor. There are currently about 2 million people living life behind bars in this country\u2014and the devastating effects of mass incarceration go far beyond the length of a prison sentence. The average national recidivism rate is a staggering 49.3 percent over 8 years, which is largely driven by individuals experiencing bar-riers to essential resources after having served their time. This important legislation will help people get back on their feet as they reintegrate from incarceration into their communities\u2014a step toward addressing the realities that drive mass incarceration, especially in communities of color. We must end the vicious cycle of mass in- carceration. I urge my colleagues to vote 'yes' on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. P ERLMUTTER ). All time for debate on the bill has expired. AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MS . SCANLON The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part B of House Report 117- 587. Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise as the designee of the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. P RESSLEY ), and I have an amendment at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Page 8, line 16, strike ''and'' at the end. Page 8, line 21, strike the period at the end and insert ''; and''. Page 8, after line 21, insert the following: (H) other relevant information, which may include recommendations, if any, to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the grant program under this section, and to address barriers faced by individuals receiving re-entry services from community reentry cen-ters. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to House Resolution 1499, the gen-tlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. S CANLON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentle- woman from Pennsylvania. Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I come today before the House first in strong support of Congresswoman B ASS' bill, the One Stop Shop Community Re-entry Program Act. Each year, hundreds of thousands of people are released from custody after serving their time, and reentry services are a crucial tool to help these individ- uals find success when they return home. However, in many cases, returning individuals are not given adequate sup-port to succeed as they reintegrate in our communities. Too often they strug-gle to access safe and affordable hous-ing, educational opportunities, and steady employment. This bill will pro-vide critical, accessible, and com-prehensive resources to these individ-uals including job training and help to obtain IDs, housing, mental health services, and more. Importantly, this bill would also ex- pand services that I have direct experi-ence to know are critical to increasing the success of reentering citizens. Prior to coming to Congress, I had the opportunity to work with returning citizens in the cutting-edge Federal re-entry court started in the Eastern Dis-trict of Pennsylvania by U.S. Mag-istrate Judge Tim Rice and now Third Circuit Judge Felipe Restrepo. We saw in that courtroom how men- toring and legal assistance often were the key to successful reentry by re-turning citizens. The additional serv-ices provided by the reentry court and related nonprofits resulted in a two- thirds reduction in recidivism by par-ticipants in that program. So in addition to supporting the un- derlying bill, I am proud to offer my colleague, Ms. P RESSLEY 's, amendment to the One Stop Shop Community Re-entry Program Act. This amendment will ensure that the grant program is evaluated for its ef- fectiveness. We know that it is not enough to create a grant program, we must also ensure effective implementa-tion of that program and that the crit-ical government resources we make available are meeting the needs of the intended recipients and are a produc-tive use of taxpayer resources. This additional provision will require evaluation of the grant program and allow recommendations to improve the program and reduce any barriers to ac-cess. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen- tleman from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, it re- quires the Department of Justice to issue a report. Seeing how the Depart-ment of Justice is already doing what is authorized in this bill, it would be kind of nice, frankly, to have this re-port done before we spend an additional $59 million over the next several years. Mr. Speaker, for the reason we out- lined against the legislation itself\u2014it is redundant, it allows people with a violent past to work at these facilities, and it actually encourages them to be the preference for answering the hot-lines at these facilities, and for those reasons we are opposed to the legisla-tion. Mr. Speaker, I oppose the amend- ment as well, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. J ACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me rise in great enthusiasm for an im-portant amendment that calls for an evaluation and a determination as to whether or not this is impacting posi-tively those who are in the program. I have already read stories about Robert and a number of others; if this program spreads across America to urban hamlets, villages, counties, and rural communities, then we need to know how effective it is. I am almost positive it will be very effective as a worthwhile investment for the 600,000 people who are released, but this amendment will ensure that we have the right kind of amendment for best practices and best evidence. Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would simply encourage my col-leagues to vote in favor of Representa-tive P RESSLEY 's amendment and the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the bill and on the amendment offered by the gentle-woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. S CAN- LON). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Penn-sylvania (Ms. S CANLON ). The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-ceedings on this question will be post-poned. f PREGNANT WOMEN IN CUSTODY ACT Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1499, I call up the bill (H.R. 6878) to address the health needs of incarcerated women related to pregnancy and childbirth, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

GENERAL LEAVE Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and in-sert extraneous material on H.R. 6878. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6878, the Pregnant Women in Custody Act, is bipartisan legislation that would help ensure that women receive the pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum care that they need while in Federal custody. The number of women incarcerated has grown significantly in recent dec-ades, and most women are incarcerated during their reproductive years. There are an estimated 58,000 admissions of pregnant women into jails and prisons every year. It is vital for the health of these women and their newborns that they have access to appropriate healthcare, nutrition, and postpartum recovery support. In addition, research shows that Black women already have a 43 percent higher risk of miscarriage than White women. Since women of color are dis-proportionately impacted by the crimi-nal justice system, a lack of support and care for pregnancy and reproduc-tive health while incarcerated can lead to increased risk of negative pregnancy outcomes. By establishing a national standard of care for incarcerated pregnant women, as well as by prohibiting the use of restrictive housing and pro-viding for transfers to residential re-entry centers for women with high-risk pregnancies, this bill will help protect the health and safety of pregnant women and their newborns. Restrictive housing and solitary confinement have been called psychological torture, and the use of solitary confinement can further damage the physical and men-tal well-being of pregnant women. b1315 In addition to setting a national standard of care, this bill also requires the Government Accountability Office to study the services and protections provided to pregnant women incarcer-ated at the State and local levels. The impact of incarceration of preg- nant women is complex and far-reach-ing. The reality of pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum recovery while incar-cerated requires significant mental and physical health interventions and broader protections in order to address the trauma both mothers and newborns experience. This bipartisan bill is supported by a broad range of organizations across the ideological spectrum, including the VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:50 Dec HOUSE H8690 December 1, 2022 American Psychological Association, the National Alliance on Mental Ill-ness, the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, Dream Corps, the Vera Institute for Justice, R Street Institute, and the American Conserv-ative Union. Mr. Speaker, I thank our colleague, Representative K AREN BASS, for her leadership on this issue and on so many criminal justice issues throughout her career in Congress. I thank her bipar-tisan cosponsors for introducing this important legislation with her. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col- leagues to support the bill, and I re-serve the balance of my time. Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, each year, an estimated 58,000 pregnant women pass through jails and prisons in the United States. H.R. 6878 would expand on existing pro-grams within the Bureau of Prisons to provide certain health and wellness-re-lated services for pregnant incarcer-ated women. This legislation will help these women receive necessary medical care, nutrition, and support while in Federal custody. In addition, H.R. 6878 builds upon President Trump's leadership in the First Step Act, which prohibited the use of restraints on pregnant women in Federal custody. H.R. 6878 would prohibit pregnant women in Federal custody from being placed in restrictive housing unless their behavior poses a serious and im-mediate risk of physical harm. It also would prohibit the use of solitary con-finement for pregnant women in their third trimester. The bill also expands data reporting on the health needs of pregnant incar-cerated women and requires guidelines for the treatment of incarcerated women during pregnancy, labor, and postpartum recovery. We all believe that pregnant incar- cerated women should be well cared for while they are in Federal custody. However, I would like to note the con-cern that the bill could require the Bu-reau of Prisons to provide abortifacients to pregnant inmates. However, the word ''contraception'' is not defined in the bill, and the internal Bureau of Prisons policy does not de-fine ''contraception.'' Because the word ''contraception'' is not defined, this ambiguity leaves open the reasonable interpretation that the term ''contraception'' could include abortifacients or other substances that induce abortion. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentle-woman from Texas (Ms. J ACKSON LEE), a member of the committee. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6878, the Preg-nant Women in Custody Act, because women's lives matter, pregnant wom-en's lives matter, their babies' lives matter, as do the lives of incarcerated women and their babies. I have worked on this issue for a very long time and am delighted to be able to support this legislation introduced by my friend and colleague, Congress-woman B ASS. This works to ensure that we recog- nize the increasing population of women incarcerated. Unfortunately, women are the fastest-growing seg-ment of the incarcerated population in the United States. Conversations about criminal justice reform often overlook their unique experiences and the needs of women and girls within the criminal justice system. For instance, Mr. Speaker, the United States has the second highest rate of women incarcerated in the world, with 64 women per 100,000 in cus-tody and nearly 60,000 pregnant women admitted into American jails and pris-ons every year. That is a lot. Some States have yet to prohibit the shackling of women when they are giv-ing birth. We have to do something. This bipartisan legislation would es- tablish Federal policies to prohibit the use of restrictive housing on incarcer-ated pregnant women and develop a na-tional standard of care to add to the pregnancy-related needs of incarcer-ated women, including access to pre-natal and post-delivery care and sup-port. My legislation, the SIMARRA Act, also complements this by creating a pilot program in the Federal system for mothers to stay with their infants for a period of time. This humane re-sponse and the humane response of this bill are what we need to do. Oftentimes, pregnant women lack ac- cess to appropriate nutrition while in-carcerated, and the use of restrictive housing can have detrimental effects on a woman's health, as well as the health of her baby. While women of color are disproportionately impacted by incarceration, they also face higher risks of both miscarriage and maternal mortality. This bill would make certain that in- carcerated pregnant women receive vital prenatal healthcare and postpartum support and ensures the Bureau of Prisons and the Marshals Service protect the health and safety of incarcerated women through their pregnancy, when they deliver their child, and as they receive postpartum care. They should not be shackled, and they should not be intimidated or frightened. The one thing I want to say, Mr. Speaker, even though many of us have different views\u2014and I am an avid sup-porter of the right to choose\u2014this is not an abortion bill. This is a healthcare bill. We also know that the prisons make their determinations on how they help women in their contraceptives. H.R. 6878 would allow BOP to collect data on healthcare needs of pregnant women so that we may have a better under-standing. Let me clearly say that separating a newborn from its mother gives it less chance for both survival and success in life. We know in Harris County, Texas, there are approximately 1,000 women incarcerated in the Harris County Jail. This bill would require a GAO study, setting national standards, and endeav-or to do a landscape to understand re-productive freedom in this country. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentle-woman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, that is why I was glad to see my bill, the Stop Infant Mortality And Recidi-vism Reduction Act of 2021, or the SIMARRA Act, included in the Vio-lence Against Women Act, which passed earlier this year. That bill es-tablished a pilot program to allow women incarcerated in Federal prisons and their babies to reside with each other while the mother is incarcerated for a period of time. Mr. Speaker, let us continue to be innovators in the treatment of those who are incarcerated, and let us make sure that we give every newborn a healthy life. I ask my colleagues to support the underlying legislation. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6878, the ''Pregnant Women in Custody Act,'' be-cause women's lives matter, pregnant wom-en's lives matter, their babies' lives matter\u2014as do the lives of incarcerated women and their babies. Although women are the fastest growing segment of the incarcerated population in the United States, conversations about criminal justice reform often overlook the unique expe-riences and needs of women and girls within the criminal justice system. The United States has the second highest rate of women incarcerated in the world, with 64 women per 100,000 in custody, and nearly 60,000 pregnant women admitted into Amer-ican jails and prisons every year, while some states have yet to prohibit the shackling of women when they are giving birth. This bipartisan legislation would establish federal policies to prohibit the use of restrictive housing on incarcerated pregnant women and develop a national standard of care to address the pregnancy-related needs of incarcerated women, including access to prenatal and post- delivery care and support. Oftentimes pregnant women lack access to appropriate nutrition while incarcerated and the use of restrictive housing can have detri-mental effects on a woman's health as well as the health of her baby. And while women of color are disproportionately impacted by incar-ceration, they also face higher risks of both miscarriage and maternal mortality. This bill would make certain that incarcer- ated pregnant women receive vital prenatal healthcare and post-partum support and en-sure the Bureau of Prisons and the Marshal's service protect the health and safety of incar-cerated women throughout their pregnancy, when they deliver their child, and as they re-cover post-partum. H.R. 6878 would also require BOP to collect data on the healthcare needs of pregnant VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:50 Dec HOUSE H8691 December 1, 2022 women, so that we may better understand the challenges incarcerated women face and de-termine how to address the needs of this vul-nerable population. In Harris County, Texas, on average, there are approximately 1,000 women incarcerated in the county jail and on average 25 to 30 of them are pregnant. The jail offers specific pro-grams for mothers to reduce recidivism and help them support their families upon release. This bill would require GAO to study state and local corrections facilities to understand the services and protections provided for preg-nant women, like the program offered in Harris County. Setting national standards for the treatment of incarcerated pregnant women in federal custody would set an example for state and local facilities to follow and the data collected by BOP would farther inform Congress of the additional health and safety needs of this vul-nerable population. As we endeavor to navigate a new land- scape for reproductive freedom across the country, we must recognize that incarcerated women will continue to face challenges in car-rying healthy pregnancies to term. That is why I was glad to see my bill, the ''Stop Infant Mortality and Recidivism Reduc-tion Act of 2021'' (or the ''SIMARRA Act''), in-cluded in the Violence Against Women Act which passed earlier this year. That bill estab-lished a pilot program to allow women incar-cerated in Federal prisons and their babies born during their incarceration to reside to-gether with while the mother is incarcerated. Let us continue to be innovators in the treat- ment of those who are incarcerated. And let us make sure women receive proper health care and humane treatment whether they are incarcerated or not\u2014because all women de-serve proper health care and to be treated with dignity\u2014no matter their circumstance. I thank Representative K AREN BASSfor her steadfast commitment to addressing this im-portant issue. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this long overdue legislation. I include in the R ECORD a Prison Pol- icy Initiative document titled: ''Unsupportive environments lim-ited policies: Pregnancy, postpartum, and birth incarceration.'' [From Prison Policy Initiative, Aug. 19, 2021] UNSUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENTS AND LIMITED POLICIES : P REGNANCY , P OSTPARTUM , AND BIRTH DURING INCARCERATION (By Leah Wang) Making up for a serious gap in government data collection and understanding, research-ers are discovering what pregnant incarcer-ated women should expect when they're ex-pecting (or when they give birth while in custody). Findings indicate that jails, pris-ons, and youth facilities have yet to ade-quately recognize pregnancy and postpartum needs either in policy or in practice. Recently published findings from the groundbreaking Pregnancy in Prison Statis-tics (PIPS) Project and other datasets shed light on a common but rarely discussed expe-rience: being pregnant, postpartum or giving birth while incarcerated. Spearheaded by Dr. Carolyn Sufrin of the Johns Hopkins Univer-sity School of Medicine and School of Public Health, this series of studies is our best look yet at pregnancy prevalence and outcomes in U.S. jails, prisons, and youth facilities. In total, 22 state prison systems, all federal prisons, 6 jails, and 3 youth confinement sys-tems participated in the PIPS Project, a sys-tematic study of pregnancy and its outcomes among incarcerated women. Historically, the government has not collected data about carceral pregnancy on a regular basis, mean-ing no national effort has been made to un-derstand maternity care for thousands of in-carcerated pregnant women. The project's sample represents 57 percent of all women in prison, 5 percent of all women in jail and about 3 percent of young women in youth fa-cilities. Our takeaway: Carceral pregnancy, wheth- er in jail, prison, or youth confinement, is characterized by a lack of supportive policies and practices. Some of the major findings to come out of these publications are: There are an estimated 58,000 admissions of pregnant women into jails and prisons every year, and thousands give birth or have other outcomes while still incarcerated. Preg-nancy rates among confined youth were similar to those among adults. In some state prison systems, miscarriage, premature birth, and cesarean section rates were higher than national rates among the general population. Only one-third of prisons and jails had any written policy about breastfeeding or lacta-tion, and even where policies supporting lac-tation did exist, relatively few women were actually breastfeeding or pumping. There are an estimated 8,000 admissions of pregnant women with opioid use disorder (OUD) into prisons and jails each year, but long-term treatment using medication is the exception, not the rule. A related (non-PIPS Project) study finds paternal incarceration is also linked to ad-verse birth outcomes like low birth weight, which are widely known to impact long-term health. The researchers' findings add complexity to a growing body of literature and con-sensus linking incarceration to negative health impacts. And although PIPS Project data can't be broken down by race, eth-nicity, or gender identity, measuring the scale and outcomes of pregnancies in prison and jail is a major public health research ac-complishment. The fact that academic re-searchers had to conduct this research to fill the data gap\u2014and the shortage of appro-priate policies they found\u2014makes it clear that many correctional agencies have yet to even acknowledge the needs of pregnant in-carcerated women. EVERY YEAR , THOUSANDS OF INCARCERATED EX - PECTING MOTHERS AND BABIES FACE ADVERSE OUTCOMES FROM EXPOSURE TO INCARCER - ATION Over the 12 months of the Pregnancy in Prison Statistics (PIPS) study period, there were nearly 1,400 admissions of pregnant women to participating state and federal prisons with over 800 pregnancies ending in custody (births, miscarriages, and others), and over 1,600 admissions of pregnant women to jails with 224 pregnancies ending in cus-tody. Unsurprisingly, given the short length of most jail stays, more pregnant women are admitted to jails each year, but more births take place in prisons, where the average stay is longer. Based on their data, the authors estimate that, nationally, 4 percent of women entering prison (in line with Bureau of Justice Statistics 2016 estimates) and 3 percent of women admitted to jail (lower than BJS' most recent 2002 estimates) are pregnant. Pregnancy outcomes in prisons and jails in some places were worse than national trends across the general population. When preg-nancy did end in custody, in some states like Arizona, Kansas and Minnesota, rates of mis-carriage ranged from 19 to 22 percent, ex-ceeding estimates of the national rate. In Ohio and Massachusetts, premature births exceeded the general population rate of about 10 percent. Among live births, which were 92 percent of birth outcomes in custody, one-third (32 percent) of these were cae-sarean section births, in line with the na-tional average rate. In some states, the C- section rate was much higher, suggesting that C-sections may be taking place when not medically necessary, risking short- and long-term health problems in babies. PREGNANCY AMONG CONFINED YOUTH IS NOT UN - COMMON , AND BETTER TESTING MIGHT RE - VEAL IT 'S EVEN MORE WIDESPREAD Upon hearing about the Pregnancy in Pris- on Statistics (PIPS) Project, three juvenile justice systems (one state-level, and one county-level system) volunteered to com-plete a survey about pregnant adolescents in the custody of 17 of their ''juvenile residen-tial placement'' facilities, providing a win-dow into this population for the first time. One takeaway from the survey's findings was that adolescent pregnancies\u2014both in con-finement, and upon release\u2014may risk poorer outcomes because of a lack of continuity of medical care between confinement facilities and the community. Even though all three state systems provided basic prenatal care, with the typical length of stay for young women lasting a few months or less, justice- involved youth would benefit enormously from consistency in medical care throughout pregnancy. The survey also showed that the rate of pregnancy among confined youth (3.3 per-cent) was similar to that of the adult incar-cerated population (3.5 percent). However, the youth facilities reported less routine pregnancy testing, bolstering a 2004 study re-vealing that only 15-17 percent of 1,255 juve-nile facilities nationwide tested youth for pregnancy at admission (with about two- thirds of facilities providing tests only if re-quested). Therefore, it's possible the youth carceral pregnancy rate is a very conserv-ative estimate, and that thousands of preg-nant youth are going without prenatal care when their health needs are likely com-plicated. Eight pregnancies ended among youth con- fined in the surveyed facilities during the 12- month study period, including four mis-carriages, three induced abortions, and one live full-term birth. It would be misleading to view these outcomes as representative of all pregnant confined youth, but the authors advise youth confinement facilities to be prepared for high rates of miscarriage and other adverse birth outcomes, seeing as jus-tice-involved pregnant youth are going through highly stressful life experiences. Services and policies regarding prenatal and postpartum care were variable: All three juvenile systems allowed abortion, and some covered the cost; all three systems also al-lowed lactation through either breastfeeding or pumping. Still, the small sample size (which represented just 2.8 percent of all con-fined female youth) and the potential influ-ence of self-selecting facilities make it dif-ficult to draw conclusions about the experi-ence of pregnant youth in confinement. BREASTFEEDING AND LACTATION ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO NEW MOTHERS AND BABIES , IGNORING THE ENORMOUS BENEFITS OF BREAST MILK When the cohort of 22 prison systems and 6 jail systems described their lactation-related policies to the researchers, they painted a discouraging picture of how correctional fa-cilities largely don't support breastfeeding, a practice chosen by some mothers for its unique benefits. To begin, only one-third of prisons and jails had any written policy on lactation, leaving many incarcerated women to the whims of facility staff who may not be VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:50 Dec HOUSE H8692 December 1, 2022 trained in this area or understand its impor- tance. Even where women were formally al-lowed to lactate, milk was sometimes dis-carded at the study sites due to mother-in-fant separation, providing only a benefit to the mother of maintaining milk supply. Because it is a matter of health equity to provide the opportunity to lactate and breastfeed (among other parental choices), researchers extend the ''further research is needed'' statement in order to understand the probable racial disparities within carceral pregnancy: ''. . . research in col-laboration with current and formerly incar-cerated women, specifically Black, Indige-nous, and women of color, is needed to fully understand breadth of experiences and per-spectives related to breastfeeding and lacta-tion while in custody.'' OPIOID USE DISORDER AMONG INCARCERATED WOMEN IS TREATED UNDER SOME CIR - CUMSTANCES , BUT LEAVES MOTHERS WITHOUT HELP POSTPARTUM In addition to known medical needs during pregnancy, some women enter incarceration with other health problems. Researchers accessed six months of activity and policy related to opioid use disorder (OUD) treat-ment of pregnant women in the Pregnancy in Prison Statistics (PIPS) study sites and found that 26 percent of those entering pris-on and 14 percent entering jail had OUD. The gold standard of care for these women would be medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), which is linked to better pregnancy outcomes and increased engagement with ad-diction treatment and other medical care. Twenty-two of 28 sites did offer this avenue for treatment of pregnant women in some way, but the narrow window in which they could be treated for OUD leaves much room for improvement. In most facilities offering MOUD, it would not be initiated in the facil-ity; they would only continue someone on MOUD if they were already on it. This un-fairly excludes women who were unable to begin treatment before admission; for exam-ple, if someone was in jail before being trans-ferred to prison, their access would then de-pend on the jail's policy. Postpartum, most facilities providing MOUD would discontinue treatment, showing a clear disregard for the mother's well-being after birth. Still, one-third of surveyed sites managed OUD among pregnant women through detoxi-fication, some with and some without medi-cation to manage symptoms. Detox, or ''medically supervised withdrawal,'' can be a painful process and has a high rate of failure for pregnant women, increasing the risk of future overdose. These exclusionary policies and practices are troubling given the fact that opioid over-dose is a major cause of death for pregnant and postpartum women in the United States, and remains a huge concern for formerly in-carcerated people. In Rhode Island, where MOUD has been implemented comprehen-sively in their unified prison-jail system, there has been a huge reduction in post-re-lease overdose deaths; replicating their ini-tiative would have a great impact on carceral pregnancy and postpartum out-comes. THE INCARCERATION OF FATHERS IS ALSO LINKED TO WORSE BIRTH OUTCOMES As if it's not bad enough that incarcer- ation prevents expecting mothers from re-ceiving care and providing care to their ba-bies, another recent study finds that incar-cerating fathers during pregnancy or at the time of birth is also harmful to babies' health. In another recent study\u2014unrelated to the Pregnancy in Prison Statistics (PIPS) project\u2014Youngmin Yi and fellow researchers matched hundreds of thousands of birth records to jail records in New York City be- tween 2010 and 2016, observing trends in birth weight, preterm (premature) birth, admis-sion to the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit), and more. Paternal incarceration was associated with nearly all adverse outcomes, even after other characteristics of mother and father were accounted for statistically. ''Exposed'' to their fathers' incarceration\u2014 even for as little as one day\u2014babies were born with these vulnerabilities, such as low birth weight, known to have an impact later in life. INCARCERATED PREGNANT PEOPLE AND THEIR BABIES DESERVE BETTER CARE THAT IS CODI - FIED IN POLICY The findings by Sufrin, Asiodu, Kim and fellow researchers offer a desperately-needed look into pregnancy during incarceration. And the findings by Yi et al. contribute to an even more holistic picture of what it means to be a growing family entangled in the criminal legal system. Families experiencing pregnancy are impacted by incarceration whether the mother or the father is incarcer-ated, and whether or not the baby is born during the mother's incarceration. Both adolescents and adults in confine- ment should be afforded comprehensive pre-natal care, including education, lactation support, and opioid use disorder treatment that continues beyond the end of pregnancy. And babies born right after or during their parents' incarceration, who risk health issues like lower life expectancy and social and emotional challenges, deserve the chance to begin life with one or both parents as much as possible. These efforts and pro-grams should be clearly written into agency policy so that facility staff can be trained and expected to provide care. One way that prisons and jails can begin to assess and improve their care for pregnant women is by reviewing the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' recently updated comprehensive set of guidelines for carceral reproductive health care. Facilities should also consider subscribing to the Na-tional Commission on Correctional Health Care's standards for health services, which have clear ways of addressing many of the above topics. Prisons and jails should make their policies publicly available, and create ways to keep healthy mothers and their ba-bies together. NOTE ABOUT THE LANGUAGE USED Throughout these publications, the terms ''pregnant women'' and ''mother'' described those people who were pregnant in custody during the study period. While we've deferred to the terminology used by the authors, we acknowledge that pregnancy can overlap with multiple gender identities, and our con-clusions and recommendations apply to all pregnant people. Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I re- serve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gen-tleman from Rhode Island (Mr. C ICILLINE ), a member of the committee. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6878, Preg-nant Women in Custody Act of 2022. While Congress made important progress on this issue through the First Step Act, which prohibited the use of restraints on pregnant women in the Bureau of Prison's custody, more clear-ly needs to be done to protect pregnant women. Many incarcerated women do not have access to the prenatal care they need. They are often unjustly placed in restrictive housing, which can lead to unfair and unequal treatment just be-cause a woman is pregnant. Shockingly, this is still legal and wide-ly used in Bureau of Prison facilities. By passing H.R. 6878, we will estab- lish a much-needed and long-overdue national standard of care to address pregnancy-related needs of incarcer-ated women while also ending the Bu-reau of Prison's restrictive housing policies for pregnant women. Being incarcerated should not strip these expectant mothers of their dig-nity. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support pas- sage of this legislation and thank Con-gresswoman\u2014and future mayor\u2014 K AREN BASSfor her leadership on this issue. Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I re- serve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentle- woman from Florida (Ms. L OIS FRANKEL ). Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished Ju-diciary Committee chairman and Rep-resentative K AREN BASSfor their lead- ership on this bill. Mr. Speaker, all of our children should have the opportunity to thrive. Getting them off to a good start in life is critical for their well-being, as well as for society as a whole. That is why prenatal care and safety for pregnant women are so important. It lowers the risk of complications that can affect the ability of a child to thrive and can have far-reaching impacts on their fu-ture. Alarmingly, recent reports indicate that Federal prisons are not aligned with national guidance for the treat-ment of pregnant women, and in ex-treme cases, Mr. Speaker, women have been shackled to their beds during and after childbirth. I think we can all agree that children should not be punished for their moth-er's mistakes or misdeeds. The Preg-nant Women in Custody Act will strengthen and promote the health and safety of pregnant inmates, providing a national standard of care allowing chil-dren to have the opportunities they de-serve. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill. Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6878 is bipartisan legislation that would support the health and safety of women in Federal custody by establishing a national standard of care and prohibiting the use of restrictive housing for incarcer-ated pregnant women. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col- leagues to support this important leg-islation. I also want to take this oppor-tunity to express my dual feelings\u2014on the one hand, the sponsor of this legis-lation, Ms. B ASSof California, will no VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:50 HOUSE H8693 December 1, 2022 longer be with us in the next Congress, which is, on that level, unfortunate. On the other hand, the reason she won't be with us is because she is the mayor- elect of Los Angeles, and that is not unfortunate. I am very happy about that, but I have mixed feelings because we won't be seeing her here again. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col- leagues to support this important leg-islation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6878, the Protecting the Health and Wellness of Babies and Preg-nant Women in Custody Act of 2022. I am proud to support this bill and thank my good friend and colleague Congresswoman B ASS for her leadership. I also thank the Speaker and Chairman N ADLER for bringing this bill to the floor. Our prison system was not designed with the medical needs of women and pregnant people in mind. This holds especially true for women and pregnant people of color, who are often subjected to harsher treatment at more frequent rates. This bill moves us in the right direction by establishing safeguards for incarcerated preg-nant and postpartum individuals and their chil-dren by guaranteeing access to essential pre-natal and post-delivery support. As a champion of reproductive and women's rights, I hope to continue joining my col-leagues on a bipartisan basis to ensure incar-cerated women and pregnant people have the right to access the quality health services they deserve. I urge my colleagues to vote 'yes' on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MS . LOIS FRANKEL OF FLORIDA The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part D of House Report 117- 587. Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise as the designee for the gentlewoman of Massachusetts (Ms. P RESSLEY ), who is a great advocate for justice and women. I have an amend-ment at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Page 13, line 7, strike ''and''. Page 13, line 10, strike the period and in- sert ''; and''. Page 13, after line 10, insert the following: (iii) postpartum health conditions. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to House Resolution 1499, the gen-tlewoman from Florida (Ms. L OIS FRANKEL ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentle- woman from Florida. Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, this amendment makes one addition to the bill to ensure that in-carcerated women have access to essen-tial postpartum healthcare and sup-port. The Pregnant Women in Custody Act includes a provision related to women who give birth while in custody or im- mediately prior to incarceration. This provision requires that women be given access to counseling services related to parental rights and family preserva-tion. The amendment will add an addi- tional component to ensure women also receive counseling services related to postpartum care because we know that women are physically and emo-tionally vulnerable after giving birth. This addition to the bill will help women navigate that often complex and difficult time period and ensure adequate access to healthcare. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment, although I am not op-posed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from Wis-consin is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, this amendment allows certain women in Federal custody to receive counseling related to postpartum health condi-tions. Postpartum women in Federal custody will be eligible to receive counseling services related to postpartum health conditions. After giving birth, many women struggle with postpartum depression and other psychological and physical conditions. This amendment will en-sure that women in Federal custody have access to these services. While many of us have concerns with some of the other language in the bill, this amendment is a commonsense amendment. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the amendment, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. b1330 Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, it really pleases me that we have this very good bipartisan legislation; and I know it is probably heartening to the citizens of our coun-try that we can come together on im-portant matters. This is about the children. This is about getting children off to a good start so that they can thrive; so they can have opportunities for success; and there is nothing more important, real-ly, than having good caregivers, their parents, especially their mom, who gives birth. This amendment will make sure that women who have been incarcerated get the postpartum care that they need and that their children deserve. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu- ant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the the bill and on the amendment offered by the gentle-woman from Florida (Ms. L OIS FRANKEL ). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Flor-ida (Ms. L OISFRANKEL ). The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Authorities issued an order in April denying Baha'is permission to bury their dead in empty plots at the Tehran-area cemetery designated for Baha'is, forcing them to bury them at a mass grave site.''; (3) ''Authorities reportedly continued to deny the Baha'i, Sabean-Mandaean, and Yarsani religious communities, as well as members of other unrecognized religious mi-nority groups, access to education and gov-ernment employment unless they declared themselves as belonging to one of the coun-try's recognized religions on their applica-tion forms.''; and (4) continued to dis- and antisemitic mes-sages using traditional and social media.''; Whereas, on July 4, 2022, the Baha'i Inter- national Community noted ''The Iranian government's systematic campaign to per-secute the Baha'i religious minority acceler-ated again this past week with the arrest, court hearing or imprisonment of at least 18 more Baha'i citizens across the country, bringing the June total to 44 people. Hun-dreds of others, meanwhile, also await sum-monses to court or to prison.''; Whereas, on July 21, 2022, the Baha'i Inter- national Community announced ''More than 20 Baha'is in Shiraz, Tehran, Yazd and Bojnourd, have been arrested, jailed or sub-jected to home searches and business clo-sures since the beginning of July. Last month 44 Baha'is were arrested, arraigned or imprisoned, suggesting an escalating crisis in the Iranian government's systematic cam-paign against the country's largest non-Mus-lim religious minority. . .''; Whereas Iran is a member of the United Nations and a signatory to both the Uni-versal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Polit-ical Rights, among other international human rights treaties, without reservation; Whereas section 105 of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divest-ment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8514) authorizes the President to impose sanctions on individ-uals who are ''responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, the commission of seri-ous human rights abuses against citizens of Iran or their family members on or after June 12, 2009''; and Whereas the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-158) amends and expands the authorities established under the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-195) to sanction Iranian human rights abusers: Now, there-fore, be it VerDate Sep 11 2014 HOUSE H8699 December 1, 2022 Resolved, That the House of Representa- tives\u2014 (1) condemns the Government of Iran's state-sponsored persecution of its Baha'i mi-nority and its continued violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); (2) calls on the Government of Iran\u2014 (A) to immediately release the imprisoned or detained Baha'is and all other prisoners held solely on account of their religion; (B) to end its state-sponsored campaign of hate propaganda against the Baha'is; and (C) to reverse state-imposed policies deny- ing Baha'is and members of other religious minorities equal opportunities to higher edu-cation, earning a livelihood, due process under the law, and the free exercise of reli-gious practices; (3) calls on the President and the Secretary of State, in cooperation with responsible na-tions, to immediately condemn the Govern-ment of Iran's continued violation of human rights, and demand the immediate release of prisoners held solely on account of their reli-gion; and (4) urges the President and the Secretary of State to utilize available authorities to impose sanctions on officials of the Govern-ment of Iran and other individuals directly responsible for serious human rights abuses, including abuses against the Baha'i commu-nity of Iran. CONDEMNING THE USE OF HUNGER AS A WEAPON OF WAR AND RECOGNIZING THE EFFECT OF CONFLICT ON GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY AND FAMINE H. R ES. 922 Whereas, in 2021, 193,000,000 people experi- enced crisis levels of food insecurity, with nearly 139,000,000 people living in environ-ments where conflict was the main driver of this crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened rising global food insecurity; Whereas conflict acutely impacts vulner- able populations such as women and chil-dren, persons with disabilities, refugees, and internally displaced persons; Whereas armed conflict's impacts on food security can be direct, such as displacement from land, destruction of livestock grazing areas and fishing grounds, or destruction of food stocks and agricultural assets, or indi-rect, such as disruptions to food systems, leading to increased food prices, including water and fuel, and the breakdown of a gov-ernment's ability to enforce regulations or perform its judiciary functions; Whereas aerial bombing campaigns tar- geting agricultural heartlands, scorched earth methods of warfare, and the use of landmines and other explosive devices have direct impacts on the ability of vulnerable populations to feed themselves; Whereas effective humanitarian response in armed conflict, including in the threat of conflict-induced famine and food insecurity in situations of armed conflict, requires re-spect for international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict, and allowing and facilitating the rapid and unimpeded move-ment of humanitarian relief to all those in need; Whereas efforts to restrict humanitarian aid and the operational integrity and impar-tiality of humanitarian aid works and dis-tribution efforts, including through block-ades, security impediments, or irregular bu-reaucratic requirements is another means by which combatants employ starvation and food deprivation as a weapon of war; and Whereas the United States Government has the tools to fight global hunger, provide and protect lifesaving assistance, and pro-mote the prevention of conflict, including through the Global Fragility Act of 2019 (title V of division J of Public Law 116-94), the Global Food Security Act of 2016 (Public Law 114-195), and the Agriculture Improve-ment Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-334), and has the potential to hold accountable those using hunger as a weapon in conflict through the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Ac-countability Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law 114-328) and other means: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representa- tives\u2014 (1) condemns\u2014 (A) the use of starvation of civilians as a weapon of warfare; (B) the intentional and reckless destruc- tion, removing, looting, blocking, or ren-dering useless objects necessary for food pro-duction and distribution such as farmland, markets, mills, food processing and storage areas, such as ports and hubs containing grain terminals, foodstuffs, crops, livestock, agricultural assets, waterways, water sys-tems, drinking water installations and sup-plies, and irrigation works; (C) the denial of humanitarian access and the deprivation of objects indispensable to people's survival, such as food supplies and nutrition resources; and (D) the willful interruption of market sys- tems to affected populations in need in con-flict environments by preventing travel and manipulating currency exchange; (2) calls on the United States Government to\u2014 (A) prioritize diplomatic efforts to call out and address instances where hunger and in-tentional deprivation of food is being uti-lized as a weapon of war, including efforts to ensure that security operations do not un-dermine livelihoods of local populations to minimize civilian harm; (B) continue efforts to address severe food insecurity through humanitarian and devel-opment response efforts, including in-kind food assistance, vouchers, and other flexible modalities, and long-term programming fo-cused on agriculture support and resilient livelihoods; (C) ensure existing interagency strategies, crisis response efforts, and ongoing programs consider, integrate, and adapt to address conflict by utilizing crisis modifiers in United States Agency for International De-velopment programming to respond to rapid shocks and stress such as the willful tar-geting of food systems; and (D) ensure that the use of hunger as a weapon in conflict is considered within the employment of tools to hold individuals, governments, militias, or entities respon-sible such as the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (22 U.S.C. 2656), where appropriate, and taking into consider-ation the need for humanitarian exemptions and the protection of lifesaving assistance.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may hereafter be considered to be the first sponsor of H.R. 5296, a bill originally introduced by Representative C HARLIE CRIST of Florida, for the purpose of adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to clause 7 of rule XII. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentle-woman from Oregon? There was no objection. f HONORING CORPORAL HIROSHI ''HERSHEY'' MIYAMURA (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate a hero. Yesterday morning, the city of Gal- lup and all New Mexicans lost a leader and patriot when Corporal Hiroshi ''Hershey'' Miyamura passed away. Corporal Miyamura volunteered to serve in the Korean war after his de-fense of our country in World War II. The call of service is one that a select few among us choose to answer. He chose to answer it twice. In 1951, he fought a barrage of enemy attacks that threatened his company, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. He singlehandedly held the line, giving his squad time to reach safety. He would spend the next 27 months as a prisoner of war. Corporal Miyamura was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his service, only learning of his achieve-ment upon his release in 1953. He was the second-to-last living Korean war Medal of Honor recipient. Now, his passing reminds us of the sacrifices our veterans make to defend our Nation. Madam Speaker, we will remember him and miss him. Most of all, we will always honor him. f REMEMBERING FRANK SCHIEFELBEIN, JR. (Mr. EMMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Frank Schiefelbein, Jr. Frank passed away earlier this week at the age of 89. Frank, or ''Big Frank,'' as so many of us knew him, is survived by his wife, Frosty. Over the course of their nearly 70-year marriage, they were blessed with 9 children, 32 grandchildren, and 31 great-grand-children, with number 32 on the way. Big Frank was a giant in Minnesota agriculture. Following in his father's footsteps as a farmer, Big Frank grew his herd of Angus cattle to the largest in Minnesota and one of the largest in the United States. He was an active member of the Minnesota Cattlemen's Association. Today, his sons carry on that legacy, with seven of them working on the farm and his son Don serving as presi-dent of the National Beef Cattlemen's Association. After the tragic loss of their third son, Bill, to an 11-year battle with schizophrenia, Big Frank spent thou-sands of hours helping those in need, advocating for legislation to address the mental health crisis and ensuring better care for those struggling. Big Frank was known for his big per- sonality. His loss will be felt by all of us who had the privilege to know him. He was a great man who led an incred-ible life. f RECOGNIZING TACKLE BOX 2 (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to share another good news story from Ohio's Ninth Congressional Dis-trict. With the new Ninth District stretch- ing from the Indiana border to San-dusky County and beyond, my team and I are wasting no time in getting out and introducing ourselves and making new friends. Over the Thanksgiving break, I had the pleasure of stopping by Tackle Box 2 in Fremont, Ohio, an iconic fish house pub along the banks of the San-dusky River. That fish house is home to a remarkable array of fishing memo-rabilia, tasty food, especially the perch, and a very friendly and wel- coming staff, as you will see here. Pictured are Angela, Rose, Carla, and Linda, new friends I made who take pride in their hard work and their com-munity. In the hard jobs that they work, they serve guests with a wel-coming smile\u2014wonderful, smiley faces\u2014and such a warm presence. Angela, Rose, Carla, and Linda, as we move into the excitement and tugs of heart of the holiday season, may the joy each of you and your colleagues make possible be returned to you sev-enfold. The ethic of hard work and kindness beats fully in the hearts of these fine women. f HONORING RUTH WARD (Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the ten-ure of my longtime scheduler, director of operations, and policy adviser, Ruth Ward. After 6 extraordinary years on Cap- itol Hill, Ruth is leaving public service for a new opportunity, and she is also adding a second baby to the family in the process. My wife, Kelly, and I have known Ruth for many years and have admired her work and exceptional talents long before she joined our team after my election to Congress in 2016. Ruth has been more than a consum- mate professional and office coordi-nator. She has brought faithful per-spective and wise counsel. She has mentored countless young staffers, and she has opened her home to those who are away from family during the holi-days. Ruth has been like family to all of us. Everybody on Team Johnson will miss her presence terribly. Madam Speaker, we thank her for her invaluable contributions to the people of our home State of Louisiana and ensure her that she and Richard and their young family will remain in our prayers as they pursue the next steps in their journey. We are grateful, Ruth. Thank you for a job well done. f b1700 THANKING VOTERS OF NEW JER- SEY'S 10TH CONGRESSIONAL DIS-TRICT (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today for an issue that I have wanted to address for several weeks. I want to thank the voters of New Jersey's 10th Congressional District for reelecting me to Congress. It is a tremendous privilege to rep- resent my district, one that I honor VerDate Sep 11 2014 05:55 Dec HOUSE H8705 December 1, 2022 every day when I take actions to better the lives of the people in my district. The district will look different for the 118th Congress. I will miss rep- resenting the communities of Bayonne, Bloomfield, Glen Ridge, Maplewood, Rahway, and South Orange. But I wel-come the communities of Caldwell, Cranford, Essex Falls, Garwood, and Kenilworth into my district. Now that the election is over, Con- gress must work together with Presi-dent Biden to lower inflation and gas prices. Americans are struggling, and we must do everything we can to help them. Again, I thank the voters of my dis- trict for their trust and confidence as I continue to represent them in Con-gress. f RETURNING TO CONGRESS (Mrs. BOEBERT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, the American people have spoken. They have fired you and have chosen to end the Democrats' one-party rule through-out our government. The days of this Chamber being treated as P ELOSI 's house instead of the people's House are over. The American people will once again be allowed into this Chamber to see their Representa-tives at work. Republicans made a lot of promises on the campaign trail. It is time we make good on those promises. We must defund the 87,000 IRS agents that the Democrats hired; increase do-mestic energy production; get to the bottom of Hunter Biden's corruption and, of course, the big guy, who is at least compromised by 10 percent; rein-state the service men and women who were shamefully discharged because they refused to take the COVID vac-cine; reduce government spending and curb inflation; secure the southern bor-der, at which there is a complete inva-sion; and reduce the flow of China's fentanyl into our communities. Republicans across America ran on these policies. God help us if we fail to deliver on them. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. L EGER FERNANDEZ ). Members are re- minded to address their remarks to the Chair and not to a perceived viewing audience. f ENDING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC (Mr. NORCROSS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of those struggling with the disease of addic-tion. Over the last few years, it has been brutal on Americans suffering from opioid use disorder\u2014100,000 dead within 12 months. These overdoses are horrible. This relentless disease has left heart- broken families across this country asking why there isn't more support for our loved ones in the grip of addic-tion. In today's paper, Leigh Ann Caldwell of The Washington Post reported that a cartel of clinics is trying to block legislation that would help address the opioid epidemic. Her article quotes a special interest leader saying he doesn't trust doctors. Seventy-seven million people lack easy access to a clinic, but he doesn't want his patients to be treated by doc-tors he doesn't trust. Maybe he wants to protect the monopoly of these for- profit clinics. It is time for us to decide that what is more important is ending the opioid epidemic. These cartels must stop. f OUR BORDER IS A DISASTER (Mr. MEUSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is universally understood that our border is an unforgivable, unmitigated dis-aster. Since President Biden took office there have been: 4 million illegal cross-ings; over 1 million gotaways; 98 indi-viduals on the terror watch list appre-hended, and God knows how many we didn't catch; over 800 have died cross-ing the border; one in three women are sexually assaulted on the journey; and over 14,000 pounds of deadly fentanyl seized, a single-year record. Illegal drugs have contributed to the deaths of over 107,000 mostly young Americans in the last year. Sadly, 14 of our CBP agents have committed sui-cide this year, as well. Despite all of this horrifying data, President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas tell us that this border is se-cure\u2014unforgivable rhetoric that is in-sulting to the American people. The Biden administration, Madam Speaker, has no plan for the massive additional influx which will occur in just a few weeks when title 42 ends, a complete dereliction of duty. f INVESTING IN CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE (Ms. BROWNLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, there is perhaps no greater threat to our future than the climate crisis. House Democrats understand the se- verity of this existential threat and the harm it poses to the American people, our health, our national security, and our economic prosperity. That is why House Democrats have championed comprehensive and sus-tainable investments in a clean energy future. Our efforts were relentless to secure passage of the Inflation Reduc-tion Act, which includes historic in-vestments in climate action. By invest-ing in smart policies for clean, secure American energy production, this law makes monumental strides in fighting the climate crisis, all while creating millions of good-paying jobs. While congressional Republicans re- main occupied with lining the pockets of Big Oil, global corporations that saw record profits while Americans strug-gled to make ends meet, Democrats re-main steadfast in putting people over politics as we continue to work to pro-tect our planet and a strong, pros-perous future for working families. f STRENGTHENING THE AMERICAN ECONOMY (Mr. L AMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. L AMALFA. Madam Speaker, why would President Biden rather meet our energy needs by negotiating with Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, nations that regularly imprison political dissidents and engage in torture and execution, than mobilize our own American en-ergy sector and economy? Why should we support the econo- mies of these brutal dictatorships while destroying our domestic oil pro-duction, which could supply all the en-ergy we would ever need, plus our friends across the sea? Instead, burdensome regulations and disincentives to invest in it are what we get. At this moment, millions of Uyghurs are suffering horrifically in concentra-tion camps. Thousands of Chinese pro-testers are reacting against these bru-tal, harsh zero-COVID policies in China, yet America continues to be de-pendent on China's supply chains. To seriously challenge China's atro- cious human rights record, we must ex-pand U.S. manufacturing and assert our own economic competitiveness and also stop our overdependence on Chi-nese products. As we enter a new year and new Con- gress, we must get started to make America dependent upon ourselves. f COMPLETE FISCAL YEAR 2003 APPROPRIATIONS (Mr. MRVAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to encourage all of my col-leagues to complete our work and fi-nalize the fiscal year 2023 appropria-tions measures. We have a constitutional obligation to fund government operations, and I also would highlight the vital impor-tance of community-funded projects in-cluded in these measures. Notably, for the incredible law en- forcement personnel in the First Con-gressional District of Indiana, I am grateful for the inclusion of specific funds for the Porter County Sheriff's Office, the Whiting Police Department, and the Gary Police Department. These VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:57 Dec HOUSE H8706 December 1, 2022 critical funds will be used for equip- ment upgrades, including license plate readers and in-car cameras, which will improve the ability of our police offi-cers to protect our communities and increase public safety. I urge my colleagues to focus on the completing of this necessary work to support our first responders and the economic vitality of our Nation. f CRISIS ON SOUTHERN BORDER (Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I use this opportunity to try to wake up our slumbering press corps on another very relevant story related to the southern border. In the last week, it became apparent that, in the last month, 73,000 illegal immigrants snuck across the border without touching the Border Patrol. So you understand, when you hear these numbers, 150,000, 180,000 people crossing every month, most of those people are people that are at least touched by the Border Patrol before they are given an appearance date at which they have to appear before some judicial forum. But there are also peo-ple who sneak across the border with-out being touched by the Border Pa-trol. We had 70,000 gotaways in November. That is the all-time high\u2014without any perfunctory analysis at all, 73,000. The border crisis is the greatest it has ever been. I beg the press corps in this country to wake up. That 73,000 figure ought to be the banner story in every newspaper across the country. We know that most of those papers won't even cover it. They are off cov-ering some Hollywood floozy. f CONGRATULATING DORDT UNIVER- SITY MEN'S BASKETBALL COACH BRIAN VAN HAAFTEN (Mr. FEENSTRA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. FEENSTRA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dordt Uni-versity men's basketball Coach Brian Van Haaften on his 500th career win. Dordt, my alma mater, bested Gov- ernors State 113-82, clinching their eighth win of the season and Brian's 500th all-time win. In just four seasons, Brian has led Dordt to 79 victories, elevating the De-fenders to new heights. Since 1988, he has dedicated his time and talents to developing young men not only as basketball players but also as upstanding citizens and men of faith. A man of deep faith, he teaches his players the Christian values that con-nect our families in Sioux County: teamwork, hard work, sportsmanship, and humility. Brian is a phenomenal asset to Dordt University and an integral part of the community. Congratulations again, Brian, on the incredible achievement. Here's to 500 more. f PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY MATERIAL REVISION TO THE AGGREGATES , ALLOCATIONS , AND OTHER BUDGETARY LEVELS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2023 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET , Washington, DC, December 1, 2022. MADAM SPEAKER : Pursuant to sections 1 and 2 of House Resolution 1151 (H. Res. 1151; 117th Congress) and the Congressional Budg-et Act of 1974 (CBA), I hereby submit for printing in the Congressional Record a revi-sion to the aggregates and allocations set forth in the Statement of Aggregates, Allo- cations, and Other Budgetary Levels for Fis-cal Year 2023 published in the Congressional Record on June 21, 2022, as revised. This adjustment responds to House consid- eration of the bill, the Jackie Walorski Ma-ternal and Child Home Visiting Reauthoriza-tion Act of 2022 (H.R. 8876), as provided for consideration in the House pursuant to H. Res. 1499 (117th Congress). This adjustment is allowable under sections 1 and 2 of H. Res. 1151 (117th Congress). It shall apply while that legislation is under consideration and take effect upon the enactment of that legis-lation. Accordingly, I am revising the aggregate spending level for fiscal years 2023 and the allocation for the House Committee on Ways and Means for fiscal year 2023 and fiscal years 2023-2032. For purposes of enforcing ti-tles III and IV of the CBA and other budg-etary enforcement provisions, the revised ag-gregates and allocation are to be considered as aggregates and allocations included in the budget resolution, pursuant to the State-ment published in the Congressional Record on June 21, 2022, as revised. Questions may be directed to Jennifer Wheelock or Kellie Larkin of the Budget Committee staff. Sincerely, J OHNYARMUTH , Chairman.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The Democratic leader is recog-nized. RAILWAY LABOR MANAGEMENT DISPUTE Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, yesterday, the House of Representa-tives passed a joint resolution that will ensure our railroads continue to oper-ate and our economy continues to func-tion as the holiday season commences. Last night, I invoked rule XIV to place that resolution directly onto the legislative Calendar. Senators are working morning, noon, and night to reach an agreement for us to act on this measure ASAP. The Senate cannot leave until we get the job done, and Democrats will keep working with Re-publicans to find a path forward that everyone can support. One of my top priorities is holding a vote to provide rail workers with the paid sick leave many of them have asked for. I support paid sick leave. My Democratic colleagues support paid sick leave, and we want to see it in- cluded in the package. We hope some of our Republican colleagues will join us. Forcing workers to choose between their health and their livelihoods is un- acceptable, and for that reason, Demo-crats\u2014myself included\u2014think it should be included. One thing is certain\u2014one thing is certain\u2014time is of the essence. A rail shutdown is set to begin December 9, but the truth is, we need to resolve this impasse well in advance of that date. Suppliers and businesses across the Nation are going to begin shutting down operations soon if they think a strike is imminent. They are not going to wait until December 9. They are not going to put something on a railcar in Seattle on December 7 that may be stuck in Peoria on December 9 because there is a rail strike, even when it is headed, say, to the East Coast. So for the suppliers and businesses, the date, the drop-dead date, if you will, before damage occurs is a lot sooner than De-cember 9. And there would be painful disruptions to the economy before De-cember 9 if we didn't act soon. The consequences of inaction would be severe: unsafe drinking water, unus-able gasoline, shuttered powerplants, and a crippling shutdown of passenger rail across the country. And those are just a few of the myriad of problems, serious problems, that would occur if there is a rail shutdown. In that scenario, nobody wins; every- body loses. So the responsible thing to do here is to move forward and do ev-erything we can to include paid sick leave. Again, we must keep working until the task is complete. VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:40 Dec CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S6920 December 1, 2022 OMNIBUS AND NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT Madam President, now on the omni and the NDAA, as we approach the end of the year, two of the most important priorities the Senate must focus on are passing a yearlong omnibus and ap-proving a bipartisan Defense appropria-tions bill. We have a lot of work left to do on both fronts, but so far, I am encour-aged by the goodwill coming from both sides. While Democrats and Repub-licans disagree on the details of the omnibus, there is little debate that a CR would be terrible news for our troops and for American security. Yesterday, I attended a classified briefing on the latest developments in the war in Ukraine. Without getting into any of the details disclosed there, it was obvious, sitting in the room, that much of Ukraine's success is thanks to the emergency military and economic aid provided by the United States. Ten months into this war, there is no question, in my judgment, that helping our Ukrainian friends has been the right thing to do. But the fighting in Eastern Europe is sadly far from over. Putin's human rights atrocities continue. He is a vi-cious and brutal dictator. News reports come in daily of mass graves, civilian casualties. Entire cities\u2014men, women, children\u2014civilians, being killed and maimed and entire cities being reduced to rubble. Yet even now, the brave and strong people of Ukraine have endured and fought back. They know what Rus-sian aggression is. They remember it from the days of the 1930s when Stalin sought to starve a huge number of Ukrainians to death. The United States must stay the course helping our friends in need. And by the way, this is not just a matter of standing with Ukraine; it is a matter of American security because, deep down, Putin is nothing more than a violent bully who will endanger our own democracy if his influence is al-lowed to expand, and he will not stop at Ukraine if he succeeds there. The single worst thing we can do right now is give Putin any signal that we are wavering in our commitment to help Ukraine. That is precisely what a CR would signal, and we cannot afford to go down that treacherous road. So I hope both sides will work together. We are making good progress. Paper is now being exchanged back and forth. We are not there yet. We have got a ways to go, but we have got to keep working until we get an omnibus done, for the sake of our national security. Meanwhile, at the same time, both parties must cooperate on passing a bi-partisan national defense act, as we have done now for more than six dec-ades. Just as we need to hold the line against Putin and his belligerence, we also have to stand firm against en-croachments and aggression from the Chinese Communist Party. A few months ago, the Senate took a major step in that direction by passing the CHIPS and Science Act, which will boost domestic chip manufacturing and help sever our dependence on foreign- made semiconductors. But just because we passed CHIPS and Science doesn't mean the job is done. We need to build on our accomplishments by adding even more protections in the NDAA so we can continue reducing U.S. reliance on risky, Chinese-made microchips. So, last month, I joined with Senator C ORNYN , my colleague from Texas, to introduce an amendment to the NDAA that would prohibit the U.S. Govern-ment from doing business with compa-nies that rely on certain Chinese chipmakers that the Pentagon has la-beled ''Chinese military contractors.'' This amendment would address a very big problem: Too many American com-panies with Federal contracts are pur-chasing chips made by Chinese makers with well-known ties to the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Gov-ernment. You don't need to be a na-tional security expert to see how this dependence on Chinese chips presents a serious risk to Americans' cyber secu-rity, to our privacy, to our defense. The previous administration\u2014one of the few areas they went forward on that I agreed with\u2014got rid of Huawei because it gave the Chinese Govern-ment and the Chinese Communist Party too much influence. Well, the same thing will happen with these chipmakers, these Chinese military contractor chipmakers, if they are al-lowed to continue to infuse their chips in our own equipment. Now, our amendment would remedy this with a simple proposition: If American businesses want to do busi-ness with the Federal Government, they shouldn't be allowed to turn around and then do business with risky Chinese chipmakers. We certainly need and give ample time for American com-panies to adjust and get American- made chips or non-Chinese-made chips, non-Chinese-military-contractor-made chips, but it must be done. This is na-tional security, once again, as well as economic security and the idea of keeping America No. 1, which we took a big step forward on with the CHIPS Act, but there is more that has to be done. So this proposal is one of many sound proposals that I hope to see included in the NDAA. I am, of course, fighting for a whole bunch of other things. On this issue, I thank Senator C ORNYN for working with me on the amendment, and very soon the Senate hopefully will take quick action to send a defense au-thorization bill to the President's desk. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. M CCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER The Republican leader is recognized. THE JUDICIARY Mr. M CCONNELL. Madam President, it has been one of the big, unfortunate ironies of the past several years: Many of the same individuals and institu-tions on the political left that have spent the years 2017 through 2020 yelling about the importance of norms and institutions have themselves not hesitated to undermine our institu-tions when they are unhappy with a given outcome. Just as an example, the newly elect- ed incoming leader of the House Demo-crats is a past election denier who baselessly said the 2016 election was ''illegitimate'' and suggested that we had a ''fake'' President. He has also mounted reckless attacks on our inde-pendent judiciary and said that Jus-tices he didn't like have ''zero legit-imacy.'' Unfortunately, when it comes to at- tacking our independent judiciary, the Democrats' new leader isn't an outlier; he is a representative sample. In the last few years, we have seen my coun-terpart, the Senate Democratic leader, threaten sitting Justices by name over on the Supreme Court steps; we have seen President Biden and Attorney General Garland refuse to enforce Fed-eral law and put a stop to illegal har-assment campaigns at the homes of Justices; and we have seen coordinated efforts by Democrats and the media to use smear campaigns to personally punish Justices whose legal reasoning they don't like. The latest target has been Justice Alito, whose great offense was over-ruling a deeply flawed precedent that prominent liberal legal scholars, in-cluding even the late Justice Ginsburg herself, long acknowledged was badly written and poorly reasoned. I am confident the smear campaigns and baseless fishing expeditions will keep groping around, and I am just as confident that Justices Alito, Thomas, and the entire Court will continue to ignore the noise and the smears and practice judicial independence. We also see growing evidence that the attacks on members of the legal profession who dare to upset the activ-ist left are actually not limited to judges and other public officials. Pri-vate citizens are not safe. Earlier this week, a longtime female partner at a major law firm explained in an op-ed how she was forced out of the firm after she dared\u2014dared\u2014to enter into a ''safe space for women'' and share her own personal views on the Dobbs rul-ing. As she tells it, simply being a woman who agreed with the five-Jus-tice majority of the Supreme Court was a fireable offense. Some of her col-leagues claimed that merely hearing her express a dissenting view caused them to ''[lose] their ability to breathe.'' This past summer, two wildly suc- cessful appellate litigators, including a former U.S. Solicitor General, were VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:19 Dec SENATE S6921 December 1, 2022 drummed out of another prominent firm because they won a Supreme Court victory for the Second Amend-ment. In their telling, they were basi-cally told to either abandon their pro- Second Amendment clients or hand in their badges. Meanwhile, intellectual freedom and the competition of ideas have also been slipping away in the legal academy. Multiple circuit judges are so disturbed by the anti-free speech trends in elite law schools that they are starting to decline to hire clerks from otherwise prestigious schools that are hostile to nonliberal views. Just last night, two such judges par- ticipated in a Yale Law School panel titled\u2014listen to this\u2014''Is Free Speech Dead on Campus?'' ''Is Free Speech Dead on Campus?'' And of course, the left's rapidly growing appetite for censorship is not limited to the legal realm. Earlier this week, in a truly bizarre and disturbing moment, the White House Press Sec-retary said the Biden administration is\u2014listen to this\u2014''keeping an eye on'' the social media company Twitter, which was recently purchased by an owner who doesn't happen to be a lib-eral. The antidote to all this toxic non- sense is renewed appreciation for the deeply American principle of free speech and open debate. No one in my lifetime has understood the importance of free speech and the competition of ideas better than the recently departed Judge Laurence Silberman. Larry was a legal genius and a patriot, whose rich and varied career culminated on the DC Circuit, where many came to view him as the single most important ju-rist in American history who never sat on the Supreme Court. The last major address Judge Silber- man gave before his death was a power-ful and important speech on free speech, which he delivered at Dart-mouth in September. He explained how un-American and dangerous it is to enter an era where ''some political speech is attacked as if it were blas-phemy drawn from the colonial period when witches were burned at the stake.'' I will have more to say on this sub- ject soon. But for now, I ask unani-mous consent to have printed in the R ECORD the published text of Judge Sil- berman's final speech, in full, at the conclusion of my remarks. There being no objection, the mate- rial was ordered to be printed in the R ECORD , as follows: [From Dartmouth University, Sept. 20, 2022] FREESPEECH IS THE MOSTFUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN VALUE (By Laurence H. Silberman) This is a Constitution Day talk. So I will address one of today's most contentious con-stitutional subjects\u2014the First Amendment's protection of free speech. As I noted in a re-cent opinion, the First Amendment's guar-antee of free speech is not just a legal doc-trine. It represents the most fundamental value in American democracy. A national commitment to uninhibited political speech is a crucial aspect of our country's culture. It is the penumbra around the First Amend-ment, which, by itself, only prohibits govern-ment control of speech. Unless all American institutions are committed to free political speech, I fear the strain on the First Amend-ment's guarantees will become unbearable. Those seeking to suppress free speech sometimes think that provocative, even ex-treme and obnoxious, political speech is dan-gerously divisive. It should be suppressed. I think that is profoundly wrong. I think it is the very opposite. Toleration of all versions of political speech is the crucial unifying factor in our country. Some years ago, I was ambassador to Yugoslavia, a communist country where freedom of political speech did not exist. I had a small fund with which I could send promising young intellectuals to the United States in the summer. Yugoslavia, then a country of six separate ethnicities, was threatened by centrifugal ethnic forces (which ultimately resulted in six separate nationalities). The government sought to squelch talk that threatened Yugoslav unity. One intellectual that I sent to the United States came back and expressed wonderment that our country\u2014composed as it is of the descendants of an enormous number of na-tionalities\u2014could nevertheless enjoy such a uniform commitment to shared values. I ex-plained that we swore allegiance not to a sovereign nor a blood grouping, but rather to a legal document\u2014the Constitution. And nothing in that legal document was more im-portant than the First Amendment. Protec-tion of the speech of fellow Americans, even the most provocative and unpleasant, re-flects a fundamental tolerance for all Ameri-cans. I was often obliged to explain the First Amendment to the Yugoslavs who demanded that I restrain the New York Times's criti-cism of their government. Their eyes would glaze over during my First Amendment lec-tures; they didn't believe me until I pointed out that if our government could influence the New York Times a Republican adminis-tration would have every incentive to do so. That finally got across. Interestingly, even allied democratic governments that gen-erally\u2014but only generally\u2014supported free speech were mystified by the strength of our First Amendment. To be sure, I recently wrote an opinion seeking the overturning of New York Times v. Sullivan, a case that benefits the press. That case, by constitutionalizing American libel law, made it nearly impossible to sue media for certain inaccurate personal at-tacks on public figures. Some have suggested my position reflects less than vigorous sup-port for the First Amendment. On the con-trary, I oppose New York Times v. Sullivan because it was wholly illegitimate policy making by the Supreme Court. A guarantee of free press does not mean special immunization from accountability when the press libels a person. A free press is not necessarily an all-powerful press. The Supreme Court in Sullivan was concerned, legitimately, about problems created by ex-cessive libel actions against newspapers sup-porting the struggle for civil rights, but that could have been handled with legislation. It was illegitimate for the Supreme Court to literally make up constitutional law to deal with the problem. Its decision was contrary to text and history, and it created new prob-lems for society in the form of media that can spread false rumors and sling unfounded accusations directed at public figures with-out consequence. The history of the First Amendment is fas- cinating. The phrase ''freedom of speech'' first appeared in the Anglo-American tradi-tion in the English Bill of Rights written in 1689. It only protected the expression of members of Parliament. This was so because, in the English tradition, Parliament, not the general population, was the source of sov-ereignty. Our Founders extended that right to all citizens, because here the people rule as sovereign. As many of you know, the First Amend- ment was drafted by one of the most extraor-dinary of our original political leaders\u2014 James Madison. His primary focus was free-dom of the press, which was included in the constitutions of virtually all the colonies; whereas the phrase ''freedom of speech'' only existed in one of those. But if one thinks about it, which clearly Madison did, freedom of speech was a necessary corollary of free-dom of the press. It followed apodictically, if you protect words that appear in the press, you couldn't suppress those words uttered verbally. There are virtually no cases in the first half of the 19th century involving the First Amendment's freedom of speech. As you might know, the First Amendment did not apply to the states until after the Civil War, when the 14th amendment's Due Process Clause was seen to incorporate the First Amendment. The first case that I could find considering the First Amendment's free speech clause as applied to the states was Patterson v. Colo-rado in 1907. It included a dissent by one of our greatest justices, John Marshall Harlan. He was the man who dissented in Plessy v. Ferguson from the odious view that racial segregation, although separate could never-theless be equal. Patterson involved a state judge who held a litigant in contempt for criticizing the judge's opinion. The majority upheld the contempt finding. Harlan disagreed. He said: ''I cannot assent to that view if it be meant that the legislature may impair or abridge the rights of a free press and of free speech whenever it thinks that the public welfare requires that to be done. The public welfare cannot override constitutional privileges.'' He concluded that ''the privileges of free speech and of a free press\u2014belonging to every citizen of the United States\u2014con-stitute essential parts of every man's lib-erty.'' Not surprisingly, the constitutional pro- tection of free speech from government ac-tion has been most strained when we faced national security threats. First were the no-torious Alien and Sedition acts growing out of the three-corner tension between the United States, Great Britain, and France. But the statutes were abandoned before the Supreme Court had an opportunity to rule on them. Perhaps most astonishing is the degree of Lincoln's tolerance of free speech even dur-ing the bloody Civil War. He did strain the First Amendment on occasion, but given the threat to the nation, it is amazing how toler-ant Lincoln was of fierce criticism. For in-stance, he announced that the arrest of Vallandingham, a southern sympathizer, was wrong if that arrest was based purely on Vallandingham's criticism of Lincoln. In in-structions to his general in dealing with Northern civilians aiding Confederate guer-rillas, Lincoln explicitly directed Gen. Ewing to only arrest individuals or suppress assem-blies or newspapers if they were working ''palpable injury to the Military'' and that ''in no other case will you interfere with the expression of opinion in any form.'' Then, we have the 20th century's wartime pressures on the First Amendment. Some of the most celebrated First Amendment opin-ions, Abrams, Gitlow, Whitney were the re-sult of challenges to laws passed to suppress wartime protests. Perhaps the most problem-atic was the McCarthy era, which my class VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:19 Dec SENATE S6922 December 1, 2022 of 1957 experienced at the time we entered Dartmouth. The notorious senator from Wis-consin was able to intimidate politicians, academics and Hollywood writers in his wide-ranging and, in many cases, wholly un-justified pursuit of alleged communist sym-pathizers. Turning to the present, I am convinced we are faced today with a worse threat to free speech than during that earlier time. Indeed, now some political speech is attacked as if it were blasphemy drawn from the colonial pe-riod when witches were burned at the stake. Threats against political speakers are not simply levied by unscrupulous politicians, they come also from young people influenced by academics\u2014ironically the prime targets of the McCarthy era. Certain controversial subjects are placed out of bounds. I am shocked at the recent challenges to free speech in our academic institutions\u2014 particularly the Ivy League. For example, recently at Yale Law School, students at-tempted to stop, then drown out, a public dialogue between a conservative and a lib-eral lawyer. They were both supporting untrammeled political speech. The adminis-tration's response was to vaguely gesture at the importance of free speech but also to cel-ebrate ''respect and inclusion''\u2014whatever that means. The dean sent a letter calling the behavior ''unacceptable,'' but she did not so much as issue a slap on the wrist to the students who were hostile to free speech. And at Princeton, Prof. Joshua Katz was stripped of his tenure and fired after chal-lenging the university's orthodox view on race. He was terminated ostensibly based on the disputed details of a consensual relation-ship he had with a student 15 years ago\u2014for which he had already been disciplined. This was only after he criticized a Princeton fac-ulty letter that demanded preferential treat-ment both for minority faculty and a black student organization. Does anyone believe that Katz would have been fired if instead he gave a speech in support of a black student organization? Similarly, at Harvard, Prof. Roland Fryer, one of the most gifted economists in the country\u2014who happens to be black\u2014has been suspended for two years for allegations that he made inappropriate comments. His sup-posed crime was telling raunchy jokes. But Fryer's real crime was his work empirically demonstrating that police do not kill blacks at a higher rate than other races, and that black students excel when faced with high expectations\u2014challenges to the current shib-boleths on race. Amy Wax, professor at Penn Law School, was recently punished because she un-wisely\u2014indeed somewhat cruelly\u2014described her experience over many years regarding black student performance in her class. She therefore touched on the mismatch theory popularized by Richard Sander and Stuart Taylor. They wrote a book by that name and have filed an amicus brief in the Harvard case before the Supreme Court. They contend that in an effort to achieve soft quotas, elite schools artificially admit less qualified minorities thereby injuring the very students supposedly benefitted. In other words, in a less competitive school those stu-dents might do much better. I emphasize that, as a judge, I take no position on the mismatch theory. But I predict you will see reference to it in the forthcoming Supreme Court opinion. To be sure, it is unseemly for any serving professor to suggest that minority students are less qualified. (That proposition is more readily expressed openly by emeritus profes- sors no longer teaching, like Alan Dershowitz at Harvard Law School and Stan-ley Goldfarb at Penn Medical School.) In fur-therance of Amy Wax's tendency to offend minority groups, she recently attacked Asian-Americans in the most unflattering terms. I gagged when I read her remarks, but free speech is free speech. Even Dartmouth, to my distress, has en- gaged in smothering provocative speech. In January, the college cancelled an event with Andy Ngo, a controversial conservative jour-nalist. His speech was forced online based on unspecified information from the Hanover Police Department. Apparently, Dartmouth has been evasive about the ''credible threats'' it received. It has provided shifting rationales for its decision. The College Republicans have also been charged $3,600 for an event which did not ac-tually take place. Indeed, I think it is inap-propriate for the college to ever charge orga-nizations for the protection their speech re-quires. That policy simply accentuates the power of those who would discourage free speech. If the Dartmouth administration had the backbone to discipline students who shouted down speakers or to arrest nonstudents for disrupting events, the deterrent effect would obviate the need for imposing security ex-penses. Regardless of the situation, the college aligned itself with those who wish to silence speech by cancelling the event. It should be recalled that, in Terminiello, the Supreme Court squarely rejected the so-called heck-ler's-veto rationale for suppressing speech. The court held that speech cannot be pun-ished merely because it could cause unrest amongst potential listeners. A common thread of these incidents at Yale, Princeton, Harvard, U Penn and Dart-mouth is that university authorities, in dis-couraging unfashionable speech, do not do so explicitly. Rather, they perform an ''Ivy League Two Step.'' First, they pay lip serv-ice towards the value of free speech. Then they use alternative reasons as a pretext to shut down ''objectionable'' speech. That, in some ways, is more dangerous than a frontal attack. Even assuming that there are some cir- cumstances in which speech can be legiti-mately restrained, we have seen that schools have been inclined to dissemble in their jus-tifications for suppressing speech. It is for that reason, when universities take action to limit free speech, they have a solemn responsibility to be absolutely hon-est and transparent in why they are doing so\u2014they must, as Oliver Wendell Holmes said, ''turn square corners'' when demanding such accommodations. So far, our Ivy League schools have demonstrated a pattern of suppression that should upset all friends of freedom of speech. I hope that Dartmouth's new president, Sian Leah Beilock, will have the steel in her spine that is needed to take this responsi-bility seriously and stand up for free speech when it becomes difficult. Her recent state-ments are encouraging. But when the chips are down, many university presidents have folded. Admittedly, one of the most serious ques- tions the country faces is how to achieve ra-cial equality. Does it mean equal oppor-tunity or equal results? Is progress for Afri-can-Americans, for instance, held back be-cause of residual racism or because of other aspects of the black experience? Views about achieving racial equality that are uttered in good faith are repressed\u2014even shut down as ''racist''\u2014if they vary from certain orthodoxies. As a result, the charge of ''racism,'' not unlike McCarthy's frequent cry of ''com-munism,'' has been drained of much of its meaning. Similarly, debates over issues re-lating to sex education and sexual identity\u2014 issues about which many hold sharply diver-gent views, sometimes based on religious dif-ferences\u2014are ruled unacceptable. Those repressive forces come from the left side of our political spectrum, but I can think of examples coming from the opposite political pole. For instance, although it is certainly reasonable for parents to argue about the curriculum of public schools, it is intolerant to seek to ban library books on critical race theory, at least at the high school level. By the same token, efforts to prevent per- sons such as Linda Sarsour from speaking on college campuses in support of BDS (boycott, divestment and sanctions) directed against Israel are equally intolerant. As a onetime special envoy in the Middle East I regard BDS and Sarsour's views as particularly ob-noxious, but I deplore the effort of Jewish groups to prevent her from speaking at uni-versities. My class at Dartmouth entered in the fall of 1953. The previous spring Dwight D. Eisen-hower spoke at commencement. He implic-itly attacked Joe McCarthy and McCar-thyism, admonishing students: ''Don't join the book burners.'' Consider the context of Eisenhower's speech: we were in the midst of a Cold War with the Soviet Union, over 50,000 American men had been killed in Korea, and there were indeed prominent pro-communist traitors in our own government, as well as in allied gov-ernments. Nevertheless, speaking extempo-raneously, Eisenhower courageously said, ''How will we defeat communism unless we know what it is and what it teaches and why does it have such an appeal to men, why are so many people swearing allegiance to it? . . . And we have got to fight it with some-thing better, not try to conceal the thinking of our own people.'' And this is the part I love: ''They are part of America. And even if they think ideas that are contrary to ours, their right to say them, their right to record them, and their right to have them at places where they are accessible to others is unquestioned, or it isn't America.'' Because McCarthy was a Republican, it was important that Republicans\u2014most nota-bly Sen. Margaret Chase Smith and then Ei-senhower himself\u2014were the ones to speak out and put an end to his reign of intoler-ance. I hope you Dartmouth students\u2014on both sides of the political spectrum\u2014will stand up for freedom of expression. It is not a partisan issue. It is, as I have tried to ex-plain, fundamental to American democracy. To be sure, you may have to draw upon ''the granite of New Hampshire, in your mus-cles and your brains'' to withstand the im-mense pressure to bow to conformity. But I expect nothing less. TRIBUTE TO PATRICK J . LEAHY Mr. M CCONNELL. Madam President, on another matter, we begin to reach VerDate Sep 11 2014 05:28 Dec SENATE S6923 December 1, 2022 the period every 2 years when the Sen- ate begins our process of honoring and bidding farewell to our distinguished colleagues who are soon leaving our ranks. Seeing friends off is hardly a task to look forward to, but it is made more tolerable when I get to boast about and embarrass our talented col-leagues one last time before they head for the exits. I will begin today with one of only two current Senators who were around when I arrived as a freshman in 1985. By then, of course, P ATLEAHY had al- ready made history. When P ATwas first elected in 1974, he was the first non-Republican to rep-resent Vermont in the Senate since 1856. And now, after eight terms, he will depart having made history all over again as his State's longest serv-ing Senator by a comfortable margin. Of course, it is the dash in between the dates that matters the most, and to say that P ATLEAHY has made the most of his time in Washington would be truly an understatement. P ATfirst developed his habit for life- long learning growing up around the printing press of his family's news-paper in Montpelier. But I suspect our friend never hit the books as hard as he did after he found out that the girl for whom he had fallen head over heels, Marcelle, spoke not English but French at home. The way P ATtells it, he ''wanted to know what [Marcelle's] parents were saying about [him].'' So the studies began. Here in the Senate, that same energy and curiosity led P ATto collect enough policy passions for an entire congres-sional delegation\u2014from dairy farming to privacy, to landmine mitigation. P ATand I got a chance to work close- ly together during our long tenures switching off and on as chairmen and ranking members of the State and For-eign Ops Subcommittee on Appropria-tions. As often as the majority changed hands during our time, P ATand I made a point of working as partners. He al-ways knew the right time to break up tense negotiations with a stemwinder of an old Irish joke. We rolled up our sleeves and bonded over our shared commitment to ex-tending American influence and pro-moting our interests using soft power, everywhere from East Asia to the former Soviet Union. And like good appropriators, we also bonded over a firm mutual conviction that our true opponent was never each other. It was the House. Our time leading the subcommittee together saw a major landmine re-moval effort deservedly come to bear the name of its champion: the Leahy War Victims Fund. And P ATlent equal support to one of my passion projects: our work on behalf of the pro-democ-racy movement in Burma. All of this work was accompanied by great humor. One time, after an elec-tion that turned out well for my side, P ATshowed up at our next hearing having found a unique way to show grace in defeat. Here is what happened. He showed up with a yard sign from a campaign of some local candidate where he lived that read, ''McConnell for Chairman,'' and remarked that, ap-parently, the voters of his neighbor-hood had gotten their wish. Even just measuring by local votes cast, P AT'Scolossal Senate legacy put the name ''Leahy'' right up there with fellow titans like Kennedy, Stevens, and Inouye. But P AT'Slegendary serv- ice to the people of Vermont has been more than a vote tally. Over eight terms, he has made a point of becoming not just a familiar name but a friendly face and a committed servant to his neighbors. And it certainly didn't come easy. The way I have heard the story, P AT'S first Senate victory came after he wise-ly dispatched his darling French-speak-ing emissary, Marcelle, into the Francophone of Vermont's ''northeast kingdom.'' Of course, we know Marcelle is much more than a natural campaigner. She is an accomplished nurse and a treas-ured member of the Senate's family in her own right. So I know I speak for so many col- leagues, past and present, in saying the Senate will miss our distinguished President pro tempore. But we know that P ATand Marcelle have more than earned some extra free time to spend in their beautiful home State, with their kids\u2014Kevin, Alicia, and Mark\u2014and their five grandkids, and with the many neighbors who are grateful\u2014so grateful\u2014for a lifetime of outstanding service. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, while the distinguish leader is still on the floor, let me thank him for those re-marks. And I know Marcelle will thank him too. Of course, our spouses have spent a lot of time together, and we know who the real leaders are in the house. I think of what the leader has said, and he speaks of the time when we worked together. And I appreciate very much\u2014I have told him privately, but I will say it publicly: I have appreciated the friendship and the work together. We did go back and forth over a pe- riod of years. Part of the time he was chair, and part of the time I was chair, but in a very, very important sub-committee. In Foreign Ops we had everything from foreign aid to a lot of the things we did around the world. But that bill would pass on the floor, oftentimes on a Friday afternoon, when everybody would say: Bring it up; we have got to get out of here. And it passed, virtually, unani- mously. We would work out a couple of differences. First, we talked about them, and then they were gone, and off we went. I remember speaking at a symposium put together by the distinguished lead-er, and I was given and presented with a Louisville Slugger with my name on it. Now, throughout the course of any Senator's career, and certainly one of 48 years, you get presented with a lot of things, which you thank people for, and you put them in the closet or the attic. This, I would tell the distin-guished Senator, has stayed in public view in my office ever since I came home with it. And I loved showing it off at a time when we have to be back together on more things. But we have on that. You talked about the land-mine legislation and the war victims legislation, and I appreciate your work on that, Mr. Leader. And it reflected such good in this Senate but also the people who were helped by it. There are no eradicating landmines, there is no victim of land- mines that is going to come in and say: Well, we can support your next cam-paign. No, they don't even know who we are. They know we helped them. When the leader talked to me about Burma, I finally got educated on Burma. And I was an easy sell\u2014I think he would agree on that\u2014because of the case he made but also because of the history he gave me. I don't want to hold up the Senate. I will speak longer about these things on the day I leave, which will be soon. I look forward to leaving because Marcelle and I can be back home all the time, but I will miss so many friends I have made\u2014the well over 400 Senators I have served with. And I think the distinguished leader has served with hundreds also. Some were here for a long time. Some were here for, sometimes, I think, in a couple of instances, a matter of a month or two. I prefer a long time to a month or two. It is easier to get to know each other. I will speak further about this. But I was honored to be on the floor when this happened. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I walked onto the floor just as Senator L EAHY was closing his remarks, and I want to tell you that we were together in the Judiciary Committee this morn-ing, where I joined the chorus of praise for his career and his service in the Senate. And it seems like at every room he steps into, there is another tribute, and well-deserved. I thank him for being such a steadfast Member of the Senate and, particularly, of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will forever be benefitted by his con-tribution. UKRAINE Madam President, I rise today to speak on a different topic, and it is one that is very timely and important. VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:19 Dec S6924 December 1, 2022 Yesterday, a number of us received a classified briefing from the White House about Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. It was sobering. Russia continues to indiscriminately target civilian populations and infrastructure, killing tens of thousands of innocent people in Ukraine, leaving countless more in the bitter dark and cold with-out access to electricity, water, or heat. The briefing was also astonishing be- cause it raised a bigger question: What has Vladimir Putin really accom-plished with this cruel war? I will tell you the answer. Today, as a result of Putin's barbaric invasion of Ukraine, the Western alli-ance in opposition to him is stronger than ever before. Putin's actions have strengthened the resolve of the Ukrain-ian people to fight to the death for a free and democratic country, as they press back against the Russian occupa-tion and regain territory from Kharkiv to Kherson. Moreover, NATO is now stronger and more united, with two new countries, valuable additions to the NATO alli-ance\u2014Sweden and Finland\u2014soon to join the fold. And just this week, NATO also recommitted to continuing sup-port for Ukraine. Countries have rallied behind the United States in sending everything from weapons to helmets, to medical supplies, to food, and in imposing crushing sanctions that are taking a massive toll on the Russian economy. Yesterday's briefing also made one thing abundantly clear: Now is not the time for the United States or NATO to back down. While Putin deceived him-self into thinking the Ukrainian people would fold and welcome the Russian military with open arms, or that Kyiv could fall in days, the Ukrainian peo-ple\u2014and their desire for sovereignty and self-rule\u2014have prevailed. The world stepped up to help secure their freedom, bound together by the shared principles and international norms that dictators like Putin can never and will never wipe away. The day will come when Putin and his thugs are held accountable for their war crimes, and, sadly, there are many. Since February, the United States alone has committed billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine, with defense articles delivered at recordbreaking speed to support Ukrainian war efforts on the frontlines. And just weeks ago, the White House requested another supple-mental aid request for Ukraine. I sup-port it. Now, I understand that some Mem- bers of Congress have expressed a con-cern about the economic consequences of increased defense spending and whether there is appropriate oversight of the actual funds sent and spent. I share those concerns. They are legiti-mate. They are reasonable. And I pushed the administration to ensure that it strengthens efforts to fully ac-count for our assistance to Ukraine. I might just add parenthetically that over the decades that we were in war in Afghanistan, it is well known that so many dollars were wasted, American tax dollars, in an effort to stop the forces of terrorism that were residing in that country. We should never knowingly allow that to occur, and we certainly shouldn't in Ukraine despite my wholehearted support for President Biden supporting the efforts. I am glad my colleagues on the other side of the aisle finally joined us yes-terday\u2014yesterday\u2014in the confirma-tion of Robert Storch. He is going to be the next inspector general at the De-partment of Defense. If you want to keep an eye out on how the money is being spent in that great and impor-tant Department, you need an inspec-tor general. It took us months to reach the point where the Senate confirmed his nomination. He will be key to over-sight. Instead of looking for solutions, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are vowing to stop assistance to Ukraine or slow it down in another way to obstruct the Biden administra-tion. In doing so, they are undermining our broader foreign assistance pro-grams and ultimately undercutting the success of Ukraine's resistance. The Presiding Officer and I both know we have to fund the fiscal year we are currently in. It runs from Octo-ber to October. We are in that fiscal year already. We know that if we do a continuing resolution, that it will be wasteful spending, and we will not be investing in the things we really need to keep America safe and strong. If we do the Omnibus bill, the Omnibus ap-propriations bill, we can cure that problem by having specific appropria-tions bills that target the money where it is needed in our future. If we don't do that, it is going to undermine as-sistance in many areas, including Ukraine. We can't let leadership fail on either side of the aisle when it comes to the spending bill. As the Ukrainian people continue to fight, we must continue to stand by their side. When the news first broke of Russia's full-scale invasion this past February, I was sitting in an airport departure lounge 800 miles away in Lithuania. Many in this Chamber have heard me speak many times about my mother, who arrived in the United States from Russian-occupied Lithuania when she was 2 years old in the year 1911. Life was bleak and oppressive for the Lith-uanian people at that time. It was no wonder that my family tried to escape the Russian czar and his heavy hand. That was the case in Eastern Europe for many countries. So it is no surprise that when the So- viet Union collapsed, many of these same nations reached out to join the community of democracies and stand with us behind the shield of NATO. We welcomed and supported Lithuania, the Baltic States, Poland, and so many other countries, as we welcome Ukraine's efforts now to stop this inva-sion. Today, decades later, Lithuania is a thriving democracy and is among the many countries rallying to Ukraine's aid. I want to commend the people of Lithuania. So many times, this tiny little nation has spoken out in coura-geous ways to stand up for democracy and freedom. I am very proud of them and what they have done. The free nations of the world under- stand Ukraine is on the frontlines in the battle for democracy over autoc-racy. It is a fundamental struggle be-tween the rule of law and the rule of brute force. Now is not the time for the United States and the rest of the free world to in any way diminish their sup-port for Ukraine. Like the Ukrainian people, we must show resolve, deter-mination, and a commitment to fight-ing on and standing together in the de-fense of democracy. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. ELLSWORTH AIR FORCE BASE Mr. THUNE. Madam President, to- morrow, Northrop Grumman and the U.S. Air Force will unveil the new B-21 bomber, a sixth-generation aircraft that will revolutionize the Air Force's long-range strike capabilities. I had the special opportunity to see the first tails under development at Palmdale, and I am excited that this incredible feat of U.S. engineering will finally be unveiled to the American public and to our adversaries. It is an exciting day for the Air Force, and it is an especially exciting day for Ells- worth Air Force Base in South Dakota, which was chosen to be the first home\u2014Main Operating Base 1\u2014of the B-21 Raider. We have come a long way at Ells- worth since I first came to the Senate. Shortly after I took office, Ellsworth was recommended for closure by the Department of Defense's Base Realign-ment and Closure Commission. So one of my first priorities as a U.S. Senator became getting Ellsworth taken off the closure list. Statistically speaking, our odds of pulling through were not high, but thanks to an all-hands effort by the congressional delegation and State and community leaders, we won the day, and we were removed from the BRAC list that August. Then we got right to work on build- ing up the base so we would never again find ourselves in the same posi-tion. In 2007, the Air Force Financial Serv- ices Center opened at Ellsworth, and 2011 saw the arrival of the 89th Attack Squadron and its command and control stations for MQ-9 Reapers. In 2015, a nearly decade-long effort paid off with the quadrupling of the VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:19 Dec SENATE S6925 December 1, 2022 training airspace for the base. The Powder River Training Complex is now the largest training airspace in the continental United States and can be used for large-force exercises that draw combat aircraft from across the coun-try, and it is well-suited for B-21 train-ing. This is just one of the efforts that we undertook to put Ellsworth in the best possible position to secure the B- 21 mission. I am proud that it paid off with last June's announcement that Ellsworth would become the home of the Raider. The B-21 represents a significant step forward in our long-range strike capa-bilities, and it will come not a moment too soon. Between chronic under-funding and a high operational tempo during the War on Terror, our military preparedness became seriously strained. A 2018 National Defense Strategy Commission report warned that our Nation's readiness had eroded to the point where we might struggle to win a war against a major power like Russia or China. This was not just because of the wear and tear of our own forces but also because of the significant invest-ments being made by China and Russia in their militaries, with the intent of neutralizing our military strengths. We have made progress since then, but there is still a lot of work that needs to be done. The importance of continued invest- ment in our Nation's military and our technological edge cannot be over-stated. The events of the past year should remind us that there will al-ways be bad actors who represent a threat to peace and freedom, and being prepared to meet those threats is the best way of preserving peace and keep-ing our Nation secure. It is disappointing that the National Defense Authorization Act\u2014yearly leg-islation to authorize funding for our military and national defense\u2014has been so low on Democrats' priority list this year. We are 2 months in fiscal year 2023; yet the Senate still hasn't taken up the 2023 bill. Democrats were more focused on spending hundreds of billions of dollars on their Green New Deal priorities than they were on pass-ing essential legislation for our Na-tion's defense. As efforts continue to negotiate a way to bring the NDAA to the floor, I hope we are able to pass a comprehen-sive bill that rejects the President's in-adequate funding request and addresses all our key defense requirements. As always, one of my top priorities is ensuring that each year's NDAA ad-dresses the needs of our airmen at Ells-worth Air Force Base. I am working to ensure that the base continues to re-ceive full funding for the many equip-ment and support facilities that will be needed for the B-21 Raider mission. In late October, I had the oppor- tunity of reviewing the progress at Ellsworth firsthand with Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall, and suf-fice it to say, things are going to be very, very busy over the coming years. The B-21 training and operational mis-sions will require significant invest-ments in new infrastructure, including a low-observable coating restoration facility and a radio frequency facility to support the Raider's stealth prop-erties, as well as a weapons generation facility to support its nuclear capa-bility. The NDAA will continue this es-sential military construction and en-sure that it remains on pace in prepa-ration for the arrival of the B-21. We also need to ensure Ellsworth re- mains a premier training space for our bombers, which is why I am pursuing a provision to require the Federal Avia-tion Administration to establish a pilot program to support the develop-ment of dynamic airspace. Dynamic airspace\u2014sometimes called adaptive airspace\u2014refers to efficiently sched-uling and managing airspace and ad-justing airspace boundaries as military exercises or other flights proceed through them. This concept will better enable the Pentagon to meet training requirements for aircraft like the B-21, which need larger volumes of training airspace to accommodate longer en-gagement distances. As always, while we prepare for the B-21 mission, I continue to work to en-sure that our B-1s at Ellsworth receive all the resources they need to remain a responsive and lethal component of Global Strike Command, as they dem-onstrated in the just-completed Bomb-er Task Force deployment to Guam. While updated planes and equipment are essential, as always, our greatest resource is the men and women who wear the uniform. I will continue to work to improve quality of life for our Ellsworth airmen and their families. More military families will be mov- ing into the communities surrounding Ellsworth with the arrival of the B-21 mission, and another one of my prior-ities is making sure that the infra-structure is in place to provide ample support for these new families. I worked to include a provision in this year's NDAA that would allow the Secretary of Defense to continue to ad-just basic allowance for housing rates if an installation is experiencing a sud-den increase in the number of service-members assigned there. This will help ensure that families at Ellsworth and elsewhere will have the resources they need to secure appropriate accommoda-tions. I am also working to ensure that the Douglas School District is able to inte-grate and support Air Force members' children and provide sufficient class-room space. I am grateful to the other members of South Dakota's congres-sional delegation for working with me to ensure that this year's NDAA will authorize up to $15 million in Impact Aid funding for schools experiencing forced structure changes like the an-ticipated growth at Ellsworth. I am looking forward to tomorrow's unveiling of the B-21 Raider and to that day in the near future when the first Raider lands at Ellsworth. It is an honor to be part of building up the base and to represent the men and women of Ellsworth in the U.S. Senate. I will continue to do everything I can to ensure that our Ellsworth airmen and our men and women in uniform in every branch of the military have ev-erything they need to carry out their missions. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem- pore. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to get this body to act in the face of one of the most heinous forms of exploitation on the planet, which is human trafficking. The year is almost over; the Congress is coming to a close; we are running out of time; and the Senate still has not passed the Menendez-Risch Inter-national Trafficking Victims Protec-tion Reauthorization Act, which was reported out of the Foreign Relations Committee by voice vote over 5 months ago.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the nominee to be the next U.S. district court judge for the District of Minnesota\u2014that would be Jerry Blackwell. I would like to thank Senator D UR- BIN, chair of the Judiciary Committee, and all the members of the Judiciary Committee, including yourself, Mr. President, for shepherding Mr. Blackwell's nomination through the committee, and I would like to thank Leader S CHUMER for making time for the Senate to consider his nomination, and my colleague Senator S MITH for her work as well in support of the nom-ination. Jerry Blackwell is one of the most respected and accomplished litigators in the State of Minnesota. He has near-ly 35 years of trial experience, has been named Minnesota Attorney of the Year five times, has argued over 1,000 mo-tions in State and Federal court, and served as lead counsel in over 100 cases. This is why he received a bipartisan vote in the Judiciary Committee, in- cluding with the support of the ranking member, and why I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support his confirmation. Jerry has always been driven by his commitment to serve others\u2014a com-mitment that started early in his life. His dad was a truckdriver who started working after the 10th grade, and his mom worked in a textile mill. She struggled with health conditions and was on dialysis from the time Jerry was 5 years old. They raised Jerry in a textile mill town in North Carolina in a home without running water. And al-though they did not have much, they raised their kids to believe that no matter what their life circumstances were, it was their responsibility to give back to their community. As Jerry said at his nomination hearing, his mom taught him at a young age that ''in serving others we find our own well-being.'' Those words inspired Jer-ry's brother to serve as a police officer and led Jerry to use his skills as an at-torney to improve the lives of others. He was the first in his family to at- tend college. He attended the Univer-sity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as a recipient of the prestigious Morehead Scholarship. He went on to earn his J.D. from the University of North Carolina School of Law and then had the wisdom to move to Minnesota to begin his legal career at a firm in Min-neapolis. After working at several prominent Minneapolis law firms, Jerry went on to found Blackwell Burke, one of the largest minority-owned trial law firms in our State. The firm was, at one point, the second-largest Black-owned law firm in the United States of Amer-ica. It is highly regarded by the Min-nesota legal community and has been rated Minnesota's top litigation firm by Benchmark Litigation for 4 years in a row. Jerry is also known for his humil- ity\u2014so much so that I did not learn until after his nomination hearing, when his aunt told me, that Jerry has never lost a case in the nearly 35 years he has been practicing. I then went to Jerry and said ''Your aunt was probably kind of exag-gerating?'' And he said ''No, it's true. I've never lost a case.'' As an attorney in Minnesota, Jerry never lost touch with his commitment to serve others. Even while he main-tained a busy private practice, he al-ways found ways to give back. He was widely praised for his work obtaining the first posthumous pardon in State history for Max Mason, a young Black man who was wrongfully convicted of rape in 1920. And he captured the atten-tion of our State and the country dur-ing his time as Special Assistant At-torney General in one of the most high- profile criminal trials in the history of our country: the prosecution of Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd. Many of the pages in this room and many of the people watching today will remember Jerry's argument at the trial and the fine lawyering that he demonstrated. He didn't make it about himself. He didn't make it about some hotshot litigation move. He made it about George Floyd, and he made it about the community members and the police officers who came to testify against Derek Chauvin at that trial. It was an extraordinary job, along with his colleagues that also prosecuted the case and Attorney General Ellison who supervised it. Jerry has broad respect in Min- nesota's legal community. He was ini-tially recommended by a judicial selec-tion committee that I convened with Senator S MITH consisting of accom- plished Minnesota judges, attorneys, and legal scholars, headed up by Alan Page, the former Minnesota Supreme Court justice, also known as an ex-traordinary Minnesota Viking. Jerry earned support from 25 experi- enced Federal prosecutors from across the political spectrum, who wrote to the Judiciary Committee in support of his nomination that he ''distinguished himself as a civil practitioner and has earned a national reputation as a skilled and persuasive advocate.'' The Judiciary Committee also di- rectly heard from a number of current and former police chiefs in Minnesota who wrote: We are confident that as a federal district court judge, Mr. Blackwell will approach each case with an open mind and will apply the law consistently and fairly. That is why he got the highest rating from the ABA. That is why he got bi-partisan support in the Judiciary Com-mittee. I am so proud to have Jerry as our nominee, and I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting his nomination. It is not often that you have a nomi- nee with this breadth of experience, this breadth of support, and also the willingness to take on one of the hard-est cases our Nation has ever known and win it. I yield the floor. CLOTURE MOTION The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.

Mr. President, I call up my amendment, No. 6503, and I ask that it be reported by number. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from Alaska [Mr. S ULLIVAN ], for himself and for Mr. C OTTON , proposes an amendment numbered 6503. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute) Strike all after the resolving clause and in- sert the following: SECTION 1. CONDITIONS FOR RESOLVING DIS- PUTES. Consistent with the purposes of the Rail- way Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) to avoid any labor dispute that threatens substan-tially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive any section of the country of essential transportation service, except as provided in section 2, with regard to the disputes subject to Presidential Emer-gency Board Numbered 250, established pur-suant to Executive Order 14077 of July 15, 2022 (87 Fed. Reg. 43203; relating to estab-lishing an emergency board to investigate disputes between certain railroads rep-resented by the National Carriers' Con-ference Committee of the National Railway Labor Conference and their employees rep-resented by certain labor organizations), and the provisions of section 10 of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 160)\u2014 (1) during the 60-day period beginning on the date of enactment of this joint resolu-tion, no change shall be made, by the rail-roads represented by the National Carriers' Conference Committee of the National Rail-way Labor Conference or by the employees of such railroads represented by a labor organi-zation that is party to such disputes, in the conditions out of which such disputes arose as such conditions existed on the date of en-actment of this joint resolution; and (2) the parties to such disputes shall nego- tiate during such period to resolve any such dispute that is unresolved. SEC. 2. MUTUAL AGREEMENT. Nothing in this joint resolution shall pre- vent any mutual, written agreement by the parties after the enactment of this joint res-olution\u2014 (1) to implement the terms and conditions established by this joint resolution; or (2) to any terms and conditions different from those established by this joint resolu-tion. Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, no- body wants a strike right now in our country. We have had challenges with supply chains. We have had challenges with finding enough workers with re-gard to our businesses. Nobody wants a strike. My amendment would certainly focus on not having a strike but making sure that the sides in this disagreement, be-tween management and labor, get back to work to resolve the problems at hand. It is a simple amendment. It says we need a cooling-off period for 60 more days. Congress finds itself in another last- minute emergency being rushed to the floor of the Senate. We got the details of this about 24 hours ago on a very complicated subject. Since 2019, negotiations have been going on between labor unions rep-resenting railway employees and the railway industry over employee pay, hours of service, benefits, sick leave\u2014 complicated negotiations. Now that the negotiations have met an impasse, we have been asked to en-dorse a proposal that the Presidential Emergency Board has endorsed and that the union members have rejected. Complicated. Barring additional action, as I men- tioned, there could be a strike that would harm our economy and workers and families and other businesses. Again, we don't want that. Here is the other issue: We also don't want Congress to become the de facto endgame for all future negotiations\u2014 private contract negotiations\u2014enact-ing the agreements reached at the bar-gaining table or having Congress then dictate the terms of minutia in these contracts with regard to sick leave or other things. Now, I know Senator S ANDERS has a provision on this. It might be a great idea; it might not be a good idea. I don't know. But we got this 24 hours ago. No hearings, no discussion. So all I am asking for is a 60-day cooling-off period so the sides can get back to the bargaining table, so the President of the United States and the Secretary of Labor, Secretary Walsh, can get involved and do their jobs. That is it: a cooling off period for 60 days, handing this negotiation back to the parties involved to resolve. Now, some people say, well, that is just kicking the can down the road. Well, there is precedent for this course of action by Congress. The legislation covering these kind of labor agree-ments contemplate Congress asking for additional cooling-off periods. We have done this many times before, including in 1986, where it actually worked. A 60- day cooling off period. The sides went back to the bargaining table, and they resolved their issues on their own with-out the Congress of the United States having to come and dictate terms. As I mentioned, less than 36 hours ago, we were asked to decide on issues that are complicated, that are impor-tant\u2014without necessary deliberations, without congressional hearings to gain knowledge and expertise required to make informed decisions. My amendment would certainly avoid a strike. We all agree on that. It will give negotiators more time to get to an agreement, and it will not make Congress the entity of last resort in these kind of negotiations where the knowledge of the issues that are very complicated have not been thoroughly studied and have not received the due diligence that I believe every Amer-ican, every union Member wants us to have. It has worked before. Exactly this kind of amendment has worked be-fore in this kind of situation. It can work again. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on my amendment. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Vermont. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have an addi- tional 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, we are soon to be voting on the situation with the rail industry, which is an enor-mously important issue, not only for the 125,000 rail workers involved but for the entire country, because rail plays an enormous role in transporting very, very basic and important goods that all of us depend upon. It becomes a health issue, et cetera, et cetera. But I want to take a half a moment to put this rail issue into a broader context and then get back to the rail situation. And that is, what polls are telling us and what I think each and every Member of the Senate sees and hears from his or her constituents is, people in this country are increasingly disgusted with the kind of selfishness and corporate greed that we are seeing. VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:19 Dec SENATE S6931 December 1, 2022 Now, we don't talk about it much, and the media doesn't talk about it much, but there is more income and wealth inequality in America today than we have seen in at least 100 years. And the gap between the very, very rich and the middle class and every-body else is growing wider and wider. And today, in the midst of this infla- tionary period, when so many of our workers are struggling to put food on the table, when they are falling behind economically, the billionaire class has literally never had it so good. These guys don't know what to do with their money. You don't know how many mansions they can own, how many is-lands they can have. Some of them are building spaceships to take them to Mars. They don't know what to do with their many billions of dollars. And yet, as we speak, 85 million Americans can't afford health insurance; 60,000 a year die because they don't get to a doctor on time; 45 million people deal-ing with student debt; families can't afford childcare for their kids. We have 600,000 people who are homeless in America, including people a few blocks away from the U.S. Capitol. The rich are getting much richer. The middle class continues to shrink. And if you want to talk about the ex-cesses of corporate greed, then you have got to talk about the rail indus-try and what is going on here right now. Now, everybody understands that businesses sometimes have trouble. They lose money. They are in trouble. They go to their workers and say: Hey, things are tough, we all have to cut back. We understand that. That is not the case today with the rail industry. For the rail industry, business has never been better, record-breaking profits. This year alone, for the first three quarters, their profits are up by over $21 billion. They have so much money that they are able to give over $25 billion in stock buybacks and in dividends. That is what is going on with the rail industry. One of the CEOs in the rail industry makes $20 million a year. An-other guy makes $14 million a year. They are doing phenomenally well. But what is also going on in the rail indus-try is that over the last 6 years, they have cut back on their workforce by 30 percent, which means that workers in the rail industry are asked to do more with less support. So for 3 12years, there have been ne- gotiations between the industry and the 12 rail unions. And the end result of this is that the workers received a 24- percent increase in their wages. It sounds like a lot of money. That is for a 5-year period. They have not received a pay increase in the last 3 years. And if you average it out, that pay increase is less than inflation to date. It is not a great wage increase. It is not ter-rible, but it is not a great wage in-crease. I have heard talk about healthcare. They wanted healthcare. They didn't win on healthcare. What the industry, unbelievably, wanted to do, despite rec-ordbreaking profits, is ask workers to pay more for their health insurance. That was beaten back. So they remain at a status quo. Not a victory, but not a defeat. But most egregiously, if you talk to the workers as I have\u2014what is the issue? It is not wages. It is not benefits. Their issue is paid sick leave. They are one of the few industries in America today that have zero sick paid leave. Unbelievably, if a worker today on the rail industry gets sick, that worker gets a mark for missing work and can and\u2014in some cases\u2014will be fired. Can you imagine that? Here in Con- gress, we all\u2014conservatives, progres-sives\u2014we have staff\u2014all of us, and peo-ple get sick. Of course, they take time off. You don't fire them. You don't give them marks. You don't punish them because they got sick. This is America, 2022. You don't treat people\u2014especially in the rail industry, who are doing dan-gerous, difficult work. Now, I have to be honest. I know that the Secretary of Labor and the Sec-retary of Transportation have worked really hard on this issue. But I need to hear from them the willingness, which I think there will be, to demand that the industry do what has to be done, and that is to provide paid sick leave for their workers. I will have an amendment. I assume that is coming up in a few moments. This is not a radical idea. It is a very conservative idea. And it says, if you work in the rail industry, you will get 7 paid sick days. And I would hope that we would have strong support and the 60 votes that we need to pass this very, very important amendment that is wanted by every one of the rail unions and, I think, is overwhelmingly supported by the American people. With that, I yield all time back. VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO . 6503 I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, the American people are increasingly dis-gusted at the level of corporate greed that we see today. We have more in-come and wealth inequality in America now than we have had in 100 years\u2014bil-lionaires getting richer, working peo-ple falling further and further behind. And there is no clearer example of corporate greed than what we see in the rail industry today. In the last year, that industry earned $21 billion in profits\u2014recordbreaking\u2014 and provided $25 billion in stock buybacks and dividends to their wealthy shareholders. And yet, today, in that industry, workers who do dif-ficult and dangerous work have zero paid sick days. Zero. You get sick, you get a mark against you; couple of marks, you get fired. This cannot and must not happen in America in 2022. This amendment simply says 7 paid sick days for workers in the rail indus-try, and I hope we can win it.

Madam President, ear- lier this week, I did something I haven't done in a number of years, which is to attend a session of the U.S. Supreme Court, their oral arguments. Of course, as you know, during the COVID pandemic, even the Supreme Court had to change the way it oper-ated, but now the Court is back in the Supreme Court Building, meeting to-gether, and listening to oral arguments and deciding some of the most impor-tant cases that are confounding the country and our legal system. But the case that I listened to oral arguments in hit very close to home because the style of the case was United States v. Texas. It centers on a memo issued by the Department of Homeland Security Secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, which he released last fall. In it, he provided specific con-firmation\u2014indeed, actually direction\u2014 to our Border Patrol agents that they would no longer have any hard and fast rules when it comes to removing illegal entry into the United States, particu-larly by those who commit serious crimes. So rather than a mandatory rule, Secretary Mayorkas said: Well, you have to weigh these various factors to see whether somebody who is guilty of a serious crime should be removed from the United States. Under this memorandum, officers with Immigration and Customs En-forcement were discouraged from ar-resting or removing illegal immigrants unless they posed a threat to national security, public safety, or border secu-rity. That sounds reasonable, but it is a little more amorphous, a little more vague than specifically people who have committed aggravated felonies. The memorandum, though, goes on to say that the Agency will prioritize anyone who poses a ''current threat to public safety,'' but it is unclear exactly what that means. The guidelines state that this ''is not to be determined ac-cording to bright lines or categories.'' If you are a law enforcement officer, like the Border Patrol, what do you want? You want bright lines. You don't want categories. You don't want some woke statement about, well, on one hand, you have to consider these fac-tors; on the other hand, you have to consider these factors. They need bright lines so they can make, perhaps, even life-and-death decisions. But what Secretary Mayorkas has said in this memorandum is that there VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:10 Dec SENATE S6933 December 1, 2022 is really no clear guidance, no clear definition for our Border Patrol in terms of the people they need to detain and remove from the United States be-cause they are a public safety threat. I would hope that crimes like murder, rape, and aggravated assault would meet this balancing test by Secretary Mayorkas, but the memo does not offer any specifics. It is, on this hand, you have to consider these factors; on the other hand, you have to consider these without any real guidance. We know it is unfair to our law en- forcement officials to not provide them with better guidance because they have to make difficult decisions\u2014sometimes split-second decisions, sometimes life- and-death decisions. And to have some-body come back and say, ''Well, you didn't properly balance the consider-ations,'' as opposed to having a bright line rule or category, which is less dis-cretionary and which provides much more clarity and certainty, I think it is a disservice to them, as well. What about domestic violence, what about child pornography, what about driving under the influence of alcohol, money laundering, embezzlement? You can look in this memorandum and you won't find any answers to those ques-tions, just the old balancing test: On the one hand, think about these things; on the other hand, think about those. The administration has offered such vague guidance with the term ''current threat to public safety'' that different ICE officers may well reach different conclusions. Making matters worse, the memo outlines mitigating factors. So not only do you consider these factors and these factors and balance them, then you need to consider mitigating factors that an officer should consider whether to enforce the law or simply walk away. This includes the age of the mi-grant, as well as how long they have been living in the United States, as if a migrant entering the country illegally somehow would acquire some equity or vested interest because they have been here longer than somebody else. That makes no sense at all. The memorandum also said that the law enforcement officer must also in-clude a consideration of the physical or mental condition of the migrant. It even directs ICE officers to consider how the removal of somebody illegally in the United States would impact other people and their family. Just to be clear, these are not man- dates from Congress. This is the prod-uct of a made-up memorandum by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Con-gress has given the Department the au-thority to exercise some prosecutorial decision, but there is a difference be-tween prioritizing certain offenses for removal and effectively exempting en-tire categories for enforcement. I think one of the problems that Sec- retary Mayorkas has is that he thinks he has the authority to pick and choose which laws to enforce. He has no such authority. Now, he does have authority in terms of prioritizing them. But, basically, he said that somebody who was in the country illegally be-cause they violated immigration laws is the lowest of priorities for detention and removal. That is what gets you several million people over the last couple years. That is what gets you a border crisis, which allows for the ille-gal importation of the drugs that killed 108,000 Americans last year\u2014 that sort of wokeness and lawlessness. We have seen previous administra- tions prioritize the removal of terror-ists, transnational criminals, or people who pose a threat to public safety or national security, and that is fine. I think we can all agree that law en-forcement should use its limited re-sources to address the biggest threats but not in the process exempt other people who have violated the law from any potential consequences. It defies all common sense to instruct a law en-forcement officer to turn a blind eye when they encounter individuals who came here illegally and committed other crimes just because those crimes aren't, in the opinion of Secretary Mayorkas, serious enough or because of the age of the individual or how long they have actually resided here in the United States. The lower court, the District Court for the Southern District of Texas, found that Secretary Mayorkas's memorandum guidance doesn't justify common sense. They found that it breaks the law. Congress has provided the requirement and said that the Sec-retary ''shall take into custody'' non-citizens who commit certain crimes\u2014 ''shall.'' The question Chief Justice Roberts kept asking is, Does ''shall'' mean ''shall'' or does ''shall'' mean ''may,''\u2014 because the law, which Congress has passed and was signed by the President of the United States, says that you ''shall take into custody'' illegal immi-grants who commit certain crimes and you ''shall remove'' those individuals once they are released from criminal custody. So the word ''shall'' is manda-tory. It is not discretionary. Congress's law that we passed isn't just a polite suggestion. It is an instruction, it is a direction. It is a requirement. It is a mandate. The reality of this situation, however inconvenient it may be for some of our colleagues, is that by entering the United States illegally, these individ-uals have, by definition, broken the law. The Secretary of Homeland Secu-rity doesn't have the authority to de-termine whether those individuals should face the legal consequences that Congress has mandated. That is our job, and the decision was made long be-fore President Biden or Secretary Mayorkas took office. The State of Texas is disproportion- ately affected because we have a 1,200- mile common border with Mexico, and we are seeing the bulk of this wave of humanity and the drugs coming across the border, and it has imposed a sig- nificant burden on our border commu-nities and on our State. But I believe that the State provided a strong case that the Justices should vacate this dangerous and illegal memo once and for all. If you think about it a minute, by saying, ''Well, you have to weigh these factors against these factors and, oh, by the way, if somebody is of a certain age or has been here a while then you exclude them entirely,'' what this memo-randum did and does is sent a clear message to the world that if you come to the United States illegally, you will be able to stay as long as you don't get caught committing a murder or some other heinous crime. But if you com-mit other crimes, you still might be re-leased by the Department of Homeland Security because there is no bright line rule requiring removal under those cir-cumstances. This turns on its head what the obli- gation of the Secretary of Homeland Security should be. He takes an oath similar to the one we take to uphold the law, the Constitution and laws of the United States. I believe it is a clear violation of his oath and his responsi-bility to try to provide this watered- down memorandum. It is completely impossible for an individual Customs and Border Protection officer to know how they should strike the balance. It is going to be second-guessed. As I said earlier, two Border Patrol agents looking at the same individual may weigh these factors differently. Well, it is contributing to the Biden border crisis that we have seen raging for the past 2 years. The United States, as we like to say, is a nation of laws, not men and women. In other words, it doesn't depend on who you are. It de-pends on what the law is, and we all have the same obligation to follow the law. The Secretary simply doesn't have the authority to cherry-pick which laws he wants to enforce and which ones he doesn't. Congress writes the laws, and the ex- ecutive branch is charged with enforc-ing those laws as written, not as how you wish they would be\u2014nothing more and nothing less. But, unfortunately, we have seen, time and time again\u2014not for days, not for weeks, but for months and even now years\u2014that the Biden ad-ministration has simply failed to clear this very low bar\u2014enforce the law. It is discouraging ICE personnel\u2014 again, ICE is Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2014from enforcing our im-migration laws. You remember that, a couple of years ago, some of the more radical members of our colleagues' political party said: You should abolish ICE. We shouldn't enforce any of our laws. But the consequences are pretty clear now. They failed to secure the border or provide frontline law enforce-ment and agents with the resources they need in order to do their job. These can sometimes be very dan-gerous jobs. VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:10 SENATE S6934 December 1, 2022 What is more, the administration has actually sanctioned villainizing Border Patrol and ICE personnel for doing the very job that we asked them to do\u2014en-forcing our immigration laws. Frequently, if you talk to the Border Patrol agents, they will talk about the push factors that encourage people to leave their home country, like poverty and violence. And then they talk about the pull factors, or what they can ex-pect to encounter at the border as to discourage them from coming or to en-courage them. There has been no attempt by the Biden administration to address the pull factor that encourages people to make the dangerous trek from their homes and come to the United States illegally. That would be something called de- terrence, discouraging somebody from illegally coming to the country in the first place. And the asylum program, which has now resulted in millions of cases on the backlog of immigration courts, there has been no effort made to try to fix the broken asylum proc-ess, no attempt to strengthen law en-forcement and to actually remove peo-ple who have no legal right to be here in the United States. If you go to the border now\u2014as I have been many times\u2014and you talk to the Border Patrol agents, they will tell you that they routinely detain people from as many as 150 different coun-tries. This isn't just people coming from Mexico or Central America; these are literally people coming from around the world. You will find Ukrainians. You will find Russians. You will find people from the Middle East. You will find people from Iran, North Korea, China. The fact of the matter is that if you have enough money, if you are willing to pay the price that these human smugglers require, you can make your way into the United States and through our southern border illegally. So it is an abdication of duty and a complete embarrassment to our law- abiding society. I think many Ameri-cans watch what is happening at the border, and they wonder, is this the same country I grew up in, or did I miss something? Because they feel like something has gone terribly awry with this sort of lawlessness and chaos. The Biden administration's laissez faire attitude toward our Nation's im-migration laws is absolutely disgrace-ful, and there must be consequences. The American people deserve better than this, and I hope to see more ac-countability next Congress once Re-publicans take control of the House. That means that we will have new chairmen of the various committees, and they will call people like Secretary Mayorkas before those committees and hold them accountable. But until that happens, I don't expect things to get much better, because if the Biden ad-ministration hasn't been motivated to get off the dime and actually do some-thing about this chaos and lawlessness at the border, I don't know what it will take to change their minds. But sometimes when public officials don't do what they are supposed to do and you can't change their minds, sometimes you need to change who those public officials are. Unfortu-nately, we may have to wait until the next election to do that. Immigration enforcement is a bigger job today than it was a few years ago, and I am afraid it is getting ready to become even more challenging. Just last month, the DC district court judge vacated the Center For Disease Con-trol's title 42 order, and the judge granted a 5-week stay which will expire here in less than 3 weeks. Title 42\u2014just to remind everybody\u2014 is a pandemic-related order designed to protect public health. It is not really an immigration order, but it is a public health order. So when people are com-ing across the border untested and unvaccinated, we recognize that is a potential to spread even more of the coronavirus. And so Border Patrol has told me as long ago as about a year ago that they have been able to expel some people, particularly adult males, from coming across the border using the title 42 au-thority. But that is getting ready to go away in 5 weeks\u2014or less than 3 weeks now. And we have not heard any plan out of the Biden administration for how they are going to do the job without that authority, because they simply refuse to use any other authorities, like expedited removal, in order to dis-courage people from illegally entering the country. Back when I sat down with some of the leaders of the Customs and Border Protection and Border Patrol, about a year ago now, they told me that once title 42 goes away, unless there is an-other alternative plan for controlling people's access to the border, they will lose control completely. At this point, title 42 is one of the few remaining tools we have to prevent even more chaos at the border. Of the more than 230,000 encounters at the southern border in October, 230,000 mi-grants came to the border, more than 78,000 were removed under title 42. You might ask what happened to the rest of them. Well, they were ushered into the country, perhaps never to be heard from again, based on weak asy-lum claims or other refusals by the Biden administration simply to enforce our immigration laws. But 78,000 is not inconsequential. That is 78,000 people the Border Patrol didn't have to process, feed or house, or take care of. But once title 42 is gone, that will all change. And the con-sequences will be dire. It has been 2 weeks since the Federal judge struck down title 42, and I have yet to hear a peep out of the Biden administration what they will do to address these con-sequences. A few weeks ago, President Biden held a post-election press conference and was asked what he intends to do differently over the next 2 years, given the fact that 75 percent of the voters say the country is headed in the wrong direction. He said: Nothing. He intends to do nothing differently. Three out of four Americans believe the country is heading in the wrong di-rection, and the President of the United States of America says: I am not going to change the direction. The Senate majority leader shared the same sentiment, calling the elec-tion results a vindication for Demo-crats. Given their recent comments, President Biden and Senator S CHUMER don't seem to recognize there is a prob-lem at all. In fact, they seem happy with the way things are going, and they have assured us that Democrats are just going to keep moving in the same direction. So if you think this is bad\u2014and two- thirds of the voters believe we are headed in the wrong direction\u2014just get ready, because it is about to get worse. I yield the floor.

Madam President, on December 1, we mark the 34th anniver-sary of World AIDS Day. World AIDS Day calls on us to remember those lost to AIDS and support those who live with HIV/AIDS-related illnesses. On this day, we also raise awareness for the global health crisis and redouble our efforts in the fight against HIV/ AIDS. Established in 1998, World AIDS Day marked the first international day for global health. Since then, World AIDS Day has adopted targeted themes to raise awareness and encourage inter-national cooperation. This year's theme, ''Equalize,'' focuses on address-ing persisting inequalities in the fight against AIDS. Vulnerable groups such as young women, gay men, transgender people, people of color, and sex workers struggle to access contraception, test-ing, treatment, and new technologies. Criminalization, discrimination, and social stigmas continue to target these vulnerable populations across the globe. The 2022 ''Equalize'' campaign reminds us that our fight cannot be won until such inequalities are elimi-nated. Since the first U.S. cases of AIDS were reported in June 1981, over 700,000 people in the U.S. have died from HIV- related illnesses. As of 2019, nearly 1.2 million people were living with HIV. In 2020, 30,635 people received an HIV diag-nosis in the U.S. and dependent areas. My home State of Maryland is not im-mune to this issue. As of 2021, over 32,000 Marylanders over 13 years old are living with HIV, with 773 new diagnoses that same year. Furthermore, recent data shows that minority populations remain disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDs. In 2020, Black Americans ac-counted for 42 percent of HIV diag-noses, while Hispanic/Latino Ameri-cans accounted for 27 percent of HIV diagnoses. This is evidence of the per-sistent health challenge HIV/AIDS pre-sents Maryland and the U.S. Fortunately, scientists have made significant strides in developing antiretroviral therapies\u2014ART\u2014against HIV infections over recent decades. Thanks to breakthroughs in the pri-vate and public sectors, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2014FDA\u2014has now approved more than 30 medicines VerDate Sep 11 2014 05:28 Dec SENATE S6939 December 1, 2022 to treat HIV infection. These treat- ment regimens help extend and sta-bilize the lives of those living with HIV while reducing further risk of HIV transmission. I particularly applaud Maryland's scientific community and academic partners\u2014including the National Insti-tutes of Health\u2014NIH\u2014the Walter Reed Army Institute of Infectious Disease Research, the Institute of Human Vi-rology at the University of Maryland, and Johns Hopkins University\u2014for their groundbreaking research initia-tives. For example, NIH-funded re-search, including clinical trials, to de-velop pre-exposure prophylaxis\u2014 PrEP\u2014medication designed to prevent high-risk individuals from contracting HIV. Thanks to cutting-edge advance- ments in treatment, Maryland has reached significant milestones in re-ducing HIV case numbers. For the first time in over three decades, Maryland reported fewer than 1,000 new cases in 2018 and continues to remain below the 1,000 new case benchmark as of 2021. State-supported efforts such as safe-sex education programs, condom distribu-tion, and the expansion of prophylactic medications have all mitigated HIV transmission. The Maryland Depart-ment of Health's antiretroviral therapy campaign has also contributed to viral suppression for 60 percent of the State's HIV patients. Additionally, city and county needle exchange pro-grams have broadened efforts to reduce the circulation of unclean syringes, provide testing for infectious diseases such as HIV, and extend resources for substance abuse. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act\u2014 ACA\u2014Americans diagnosed with HIV or at risk of transmission have more meaningful access to healthcare cov-erage and health insurance. Today, Americans cannot be dropped or denied coverage because of pre-existing health conditions such as HIV. The ACA also gives States the option to expand Med-icaid, the largest payer for those who need HIV treatment in the country. The ACA's investments in community health centers' Ending the HIV Epi-demic Initiative is an integral part of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. The ACA has also established new health plan standards or essential health benefits that must be covered under certain health plans. Benefits such as prescription drug services, hos-pital inpatient care, lab tests, HIV screening, PrEP, and other preventive services aim to preserve the health of those with HIV while mitigating fur-ther transmission. Under the ACA, most health insurance plans must pro-vide preventative services, including HIV testing for those aged 15 to 65. PrEP to inhibit HIV is also provided for HIV-negative adults at high risk for contracting HIV. I am proud to cospon-sor the PrEP Access and Coverage Act of 2021, which would expand access to PrEP and work to reduce disparities among those recommended and pre-scribed the medication through mul-tiple initiatives, including eliminating out-of-pocket costs for the medication. These investments in an infrastruc- ture to test and treat HIV have helped reduce the spread of HIV/AIDs, but have also been essential in curbing the spread of mpox. It has provided natural points of care for testing, access to treatment, and education to popu-lations also vulnerable to contracting mpox. However, HIV/AIDS is not an issue the U.S. faces in isolation. Outside the U.S., the global HIV/AIDs epidemic re-mains a grave public health challenge. In 2021, approximately 38.4 million peo-ple lived with HIV across the globe, in-cluding 1.7 million children between 0 and 14 years of age. Last year, roughly 1.5 million people contracted HIV. Nev-ertheless, the international community has made significant process in HIV testing and treatment over recent dec-ades. By the end of 2021, 28.7 million people with HIV, about 75 percent, were receiving ART, while approximately 68 percent of all people with HIV reached viral suppression. In 2021, an estimated 650,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses worldwide, down from 2 mil-lion people in 2004 and 1.4 million in 2010. Since its inception in 2003, the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief\u2014PEPFAR\u2014represents an ex-traordinary commitment to global health, aiming to prevent, diagnose, and treat HIV infections. Over nearly 20 years, the U.S. has invested more than $100 billion in the global response to HIV/AIDS. Because of this, we have made significant inroads in access to testing and ART. In 2021, PEPFAR provided HIV test- ing services for more than 50 million people and supported ART for nearly 19 million people. As of today, U.S. lead-ership through PEPFAR has saved an estimated 20 million lives and pre-vented millions of HIV infections. PEPFAR now operates in over 50 coun-tries, training hundreds of thousands of healthcare workers and providing crit-ical support to healthcare systems. PEPFAR is a powerful example of sin-cere, effective, and transparent U.S. global health leadership and coopera-tion. The COVID-19 pandemic produced a stark reminder that we must swiftly respond to global health crises. It dem-onstrates that diseases cannot be eas-ily confined to national borders and re-gional spheres. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted HIV treatments and prevention services, separating patients from healthcare providers. Vulnerable populations have also been disconnected from edu-cational and counseling services while economic downturns exasperated social and economic inequalities. Marginalized populations and now more susceptible to HIV infection and less likely to access necessary services than before the pandemic's onset. Our interconnected world demands Amer-ican vigilance, conscientiousness, and our strong investment in global health systems. Our battle against HIV is far from over. The U.S. must continue to define global health leadership and facilitate cooperation with our foreign partners and allies. I commend President Biden for his enduring support for PEPFAR. I also recognize international partner-ships, including the Global Fund along with faith-based organizations and civil society for their long-held com-mitment to eradicating HIV/AIDS. Most importantly, I want to recognize those living with HIV/AIDS across the globe. Your dignity, fortitude, and en-durance testify to the extraordinary power of the human spirit. And in ac-cordance with that drive and spirit, we will prevail in this fight. f ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS TRIBUTE TO MARK GHILARDUCCI Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to honor Mark Ghilarducci, director of the California Office of Emergency Services\u2014CalOES\u2014as he retires following years of committed and extraordinarily capable public service. Director Ghilarducci's laudable ca- reer spans 30 years of service in public safety and government management at the local, State, and Federal levels, as well as more than 12 years in the pri-vate sector, working in security and crisis management globally. I, myself, have had the pleasure of working with Mr. Ghilarducci and have witnessed firsthand his dedication to the safety of all Californians. Early in his career, Director Ghilarducci served as the deputy State fire chief at CalOES. In this role, he oversaw special operations such as the State Urban Search and Rescue Re-sponse System. Director Ghilarducci helped develop this search and rescue system in the wake of the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, and this system has since served as the model for the Nation. In fact, Ghilarducci relied on this system as he led the Federal search and rescue operations in the wake of the 1995 terrorist bombings in Oklahoma City, demonstrating the sys-tem's effectiveness, as well as his own courage in the face of disaster. Twenty years later, he served as an adviser to the State of Louisiana and Governor Kathleen Blanco in the wake of Hurri-cane Katrina and provided on the ground assistance. In 2000, he was appointed deputy di- rector of CalOES, where he oversaw statewide emergency operations, plan-ning, and training. Drawing from his experience in State and national emer-gency response, Director Ghilarducci utilized his position to advocate for preventative disaster management and clearer communication between local, State, and Federal agencies with dis-aster-relief organizations. During his VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:30 S6940 December 1, 2022 tenure, CalOES expanded its mission to encompass more than natural disas-ters, adding programs that focused on terrorism prevention and cybersecurity attacks and developed faster and broader disaster response to public health emergencies like COVID-19. In February 2012, Governor Jerry Brown appointed Ghilarducci to sec-retary of the California Emergency Management Agency, a great fit for someone so well-qualified. The fol-lowing year, the Governor appointed him to director of CalOES and he has held this position ever since. While in this role, Ghilarducci briefed President Obama in 2014 on California's historic drought, as well as President Trump and President Biden during their re-spective visits to California after nat-ural disaster events, including the Camp and Caldor fires. Under his direc-tion, CalOES improved and modernized the State's emergency management. Earlier this year, CalOES announced a first in the Nation grant program fo-cused on building community resil-ience to prevent long-term disaster im-pacts. As one of California's Senators, I ex- tend my deepest gratitude to Director Ghilarducci for his tireless commit-ment to the safety of Californians and Americans nationwide. Please join me in wishing him a safe, prosperous, and well-earned retirement. f TRIBUTE TO CHRISTINA GRETTLER Mr. THUNE.

A bill to amend the Immigra- tion and Nationality Act to include aliens passing in transit through the United States to board a vessel on which the alien will perform ship-to- ship liquid cargo transfer operations within a class of nonimmigrant aliens, and for other purposes; to the Com-mittee on the Judiciary. Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Energy Security and Lightering Independence Act of 2022. This bipartisan bill would allow foreign crewmembers of lightering ships to ob-tain a visa for a time period consistent with the duties of their work in the United States. This bill would amend the C and D visa categories in the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow foreign crew-members who are involved in ship-to- ship liquid transfer to be granted non-immigrant visas for up to 180 days. This affects those crewmembers who are involved in moving oil from one ship to another and then transporting it into the interior of the United States. The bill also clarifies that these crewmembers are engaged in foreign trade and are not considered to be per-forming labor within the United States. Many vessels carrying crude oil or liquid natural gas are too large to enter U.S. ports, so lightering crews transfer these imports onto smaller vessels capable of entering U.S. ports. Crews may also transfer oil and liquified natural gas from smaller ves-sels to larger ships to consolidate ex-ports bound for foreign ports. Approxi-mately 74 percent of all U.S. exports and 44 percent of all U.S. imports of crude oil or natural gas are conducted by lightering. Currently, crewmember visas are granted for 29 days, which is an insuffi-cient time for lightering crews to get their work done. Customs and Border Protection must parole crewmembers into the United States on a case-by- case basis, which is administratively burdensome on the Agency. In fact, it is estimated that this bill could save CBP $250,000 and 6,000 man-hours per year. I want to thank Senator C ORNYN for joining me in this effort, and I urge my colleagues to join us in passing this technical fix as quickly as possible. f SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS SENATE RESOLUTION 855\u2014RECOG- NIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION Mr. BLUMENTHAL (for himself and Mrs. B LACKBURN ) submitted the fol- lowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation: S. R ES. 855 Whereas, on October 27, 1972, Congress passed, and President Richard Milhous Nixon VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:30 SENATE S6943 December 1, 2022 signed into law, the Consumer Product Safe- ty Act (15 U.S.C. 2051 et seq.), which estab-lished the Consumer Product Safety Com-mission (referred to in this preamble as the ''Commission'') to protect consumers from unsafe products; Whereas, for 50 years, the Commission has acted to fulfill the purposes of the Consumer Product Safety Act, which include\u2014 (1) protecting the public against unreason- able risks of injury associated with con-sumer products, substantial product hazards, imminently hazardous consumer products, and products in violation of consumer prod-uct safety rules; (2) assisting consumers in evaluating the comparative safety of consumer products; (3) developing uniform safety standards for consumer products and minimizing con-flicting State and local regulations; and (4) promoting research and investigation into the causes and prevention of product-re-lated deaths, illnesses, and injuries; Whereas, in addition to the responsibilities of the Commission under the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Commission en-forces numerous other statutes, including\u2014 (1) the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261 et seq.); (2) the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1191 et seq.); (3) the Refrigerator Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1211 \u00a51214); (4) the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.); and (5) the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 8001 et seq.); Whereas millions of serious and fatal inju- ries have been prevented, saving the lives of consumers, thanks to the work of the Com-mission\u2014 (1) developing safety standards; (2) working with voluntary standards orga- nizations to bring industry groups, manufac-turers, and consumer groups together to es-tablish voluntary standards; (3) removing unreasonably dangerous prod- ucts from the marketplace; and (4) holding companies accountable when they fail to meet consumer product protec-tion standards and laws; Whereas the many successes of the Com- mission in protecting consumers of the United States include\u2014 (1) with respect to refrigerators, that\u2014 (A) 96 children died due to being trapped and suffocating in refrigerators between 1973 and 1984; and (B) only 2 children reportedly died under similar circumstances in the 25 years pre-ceding the date of adoption of this resolu-tion; (2) with respect to garage doors, that\u2014 (A) after the deaths of 46 children involv- ing garage doors during the period of 1982 to 1990, in 1992 the Commission introduced a safety standard; and (B) there have been only 2 child deaths in- volving garage doors in the decade preceding the date of adoption of this resolution; (3) with respect to fires, that between 1980 and 2018 there was a 43 percent decrease in residential fires, a 47 percent decrease in fire deaths, and a 41 percent decrease in fire inju-ries; (4) with respect to child poisonings, that between 1972 and 2020 there was an 80 percent decline in pediatric poisonings for children under the age of 5; (5) with respect to bicycles, that\u2014 (A) the bicycle safety standards developed by the Commission became effective in 1975; and (B) between 1973 and 2020, bicycle injuries in the United States declined 35 percent; and (6) with respect to pools, that between 1975 and 2019, injuries associated with in-ground swimming pools and equipment declined 55 percent; and Whereas the Commission works to meet the ongoing challenges of consumer product safety: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate\u2014 (1) recognizes the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051 et seq.), which created the Consumer Product Safety Commission (re-ferred to in this resolution as the ''Commis-sion''); (2) expresses appreciation for the actions of the Commission taken to protect the people of the United States from dangerous con-sumer products; (3) acknowledges that while the Commis- sion has made great strides in consumer product safety, the risk of injury or death from consumer products, both new and old, remains; and (4) commits to working with the Commis- sion in furtherance of making consumer products as safe as possible. f SENATE RESOLUTION 856\u2014COM- MEMORATING AND SUPPORTING THE GOALS OF WORLD AIDS DAY Mr. BOOKER (for himself and Mr. S ULLIVAN ) submitted the following res- olution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations: S. R ES. 856 Whereas, as of the end of 2021, an estimated 38,400,000 people were living with human im-munodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired im-munodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), including 1,700,000 children; Whereas, in the United States, more than 770,000 people with AIDS have died since the beginning of the HIV epidemic, including over 18,000 deaths among people with diag-nosed HIV in 2020, with the disease dis-proportionately affecting communities of color; Whereas, in 2020, over 30,000 people became newly diagnosed with HIV in the United States; Whereas communities of color are dis- proportionately affected by HIV in the United States; Whereas, in order to address the HIV epi- demic in the United States, on August 18, 1990, Congress enacted the Ryan White Com-prehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act (Public Law 101-381; commonly referred to as the ''Ryan White CARE Act'') to provide pri-mary medical care and essential support services for people living with HIV who are uninsured or underinsured; Whereas the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Pro- gram provides services and support for over half of all people diagnosed with HIV in the United States; Whereas, to further focus attention on the HIV/AIDS epidemic among minority commu-nities in the United States, in 1998 the Mi-nority AIDS Initiative was established to provide funds to State and local institutions and organizations to best serve the health care costs and support the needs of racial and ethnic minorities living with HIV; Whereas the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals established a global tar-get to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030; Whereas, in order to further address the global HIV/AIDS epidemic, in 2003, Congress and the White House created the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (referred to in this preamble as ''PEPFAR''); Whereas the United States PEPFAR pro- gram remains the largest commitment in history by any country to combat a single disease; Whereas, as of September 30, 2022, PEPFAR has supported treatment for more than 20,000,000 people, and has enabled 5,500,000 in- fants of mothers living with HIV to be born HIV-free; Whereas, in fiscal year 2021, PEPFAR di- rectly supported HIV testing and counseling for 64,700,000 people; Whereas the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was launched in 2002, and, as of 2021, has helped provide antiretroviral therapy to approximately 23,300,000 people living with HIV/AIDS and to 670,000 pregnant women to prevent the trans-mission of HIV/AIDS to their children, sav-ing an estimated 50,000,000 lives; Whereas the United States is the largest donor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tu-berculosis and Malaria, and every $1 contrib-uted by the United States leverages an addi-tional $2 from other donors, as required by law; Whereas, with United States leadership, global partners pledged record amounts to combat infectious diseases at the seventh re-plenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS in September 2022; Whereas considerable progress has been made in the fight against HIV/AIDS, includ-ing a nearly 30-percent reduction in new HIV infections, an over 50-percent reduction in new HIV infections among children, and an over 45-percent reduction in the number of AIDS-related deaths between 2010 and 2020; Whereas approximately 28,700,000 people had access to antiretroviral therapy in 2021, compared to only 7,800,000 people who had ac-cess to such therapy in 2010; Whereas research funded by the National Institutes of Health found that HIV treat-ment not only saves the lives of people living with HIV, but people living with HIV on ef-fective antiretroviral therapy and who are durably virally suppressed cannot sexually transmit HIV-proving that HIV treatment is prevention; Whereas it is estimated that, without treatment, half of all infants living with HIV will die before their second birthday; Whereas, despite the remarkable progress in combating HIV, significant challenges re-main; Whereas there were approximately 1,500,000 new HIV infections in 2021 globally, struc-tural barriers continue to make testing and treatment programs inaccessible to highly vulnerable populations, and an estimated 5,900,000 people living with HIV globally still do not know their HIV status; Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nearly 31,000 people were diagnosed with HIV in the United States in 2020 and 13 percent of the 1,200,000 people in the United States living with HIV are not aware of their HIV status; Whereas men who have sex with men (re- ferred to in this preamble as ''MSM''), par-ticularly young MSM of color, are the popu-lation most affected by HIV in the United States; Whereas southern States bear the greatest burden of HIV in the United States, account-ing for 51 percent of new infections in 2018; Whereas people living with HIV are fre- quently susceptible to other infections, such as hepatitis B and C and tuberculosis; Whereas the opioid and heroin epidemics have led to increased numbers of new HIV in-fections among people who inject drugs, and the crisis has disproportionately affected nonurban areas, where HIV prevalence rates have been low historically and have limited services for HIV prevention and treatment and substance use disorder treatment; Whereas the COVID-19 pandemic has placed a significant burden on the public health systems across the United States and the globe; Whereas 2023 marks the 20th anniversary of the PEPFAR program, an initiative VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:30 SENATE S6944 December 1, 2022 launched by President George W. Bush with bi-partisan support that has become the pri-mary policy instrument of the United States to address HIV/AIDS in the developing world; Whereas December 1 of each year is inter- nationally recognized as ''World AIDS Day''; and Whereas, in 2022, commemorations for World AIDS Day recognize that the inequal-ities which perpetuate the AIDS pandemic are not inevitable and that the world can tackle them: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate\u2014 (1) supports the goals and ideals of World AIDS Day, including the goal to achieve zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination, and zero AIDS-related deaths; (2) commends the efforts and achievements in combating HIV/AIDS through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act, the Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative, the Cen-ters for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Adminis-tration, the Office of Minority Health, and the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services; (3) commends the efforts and achievements in combating HIV/AIDS made by the Presi-dent's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS; (4) supports efforts to end the HIV epi- demic in the United States and around the world by 2030; (5) supports continued funding for preven- tion, care, and treatment services, and re-search programs for communities impacted by HIV and people living with HIV in the United States and globally; (6) urges, in order to ensure that an AIDS- free generation is achievable, rapid action by all countries toward further expansion and scale-up of antiretroviral treatment pro-grams, including efforts to reduce disparities and improve access for children to life saving medications; (7) encourages the scaling up of com- prehensive prevention services, including biomedical and structural interventions, to ensure inclusive access to programs and ap-propriate protections for all people at risk of contracting HIV, especially in communities disproportionately impacted; (8) calls for greater focus on the HIV-re- lated vulnerabilities of women and girls, in-cluding women and girls at risk for or who have survived violence or faced discrimina-tion as a result of the disease; (9) supports continued leadership by the United States in domestic, bilateral, multi-lateral, and private sector efforts to fight HIV; (10) encourages input from civil society in the development and implementation of do-mestic and global HIV policies and programs that guide the response; (11) encourages and supports greater de- grees of ownership and shared responsibility by developing countries in order to ensure the sustainability of the domestic responses to HIV/AIDS by those countries; and (12) urges other members of the inter- national community to sustain and scale up their support for and financial contributions to efforts around the world to combat HIV. f SENATE RESOLUTION 857\u2014CON- GRATULATING THE LOS ANGE-LES FOOTBALL CLUB FOR WIN-NING THE 2022 MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER CUP Mr. PADILLA (for himself and Mrs. F EINSTEIN ) submitted the following res-olution; which was considered and agreed to: S.

PETER A. DeFAZIO OF OREGON IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, November 30, 2022 Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, we're here today to end three years of contract negotia-tions between the freight railroads and their workforce. For three years, more than 115,000 essen- tial railroad employees have worked without a new contract or a pay raise, all the while en-during a global pandemic and new work rules that further erode their quality of life. We shouldn't be here today. But the freight railroads brought us here, and now we have to act. This all could have been avoided had the railroads been willing to provide their employ-ees with a basic protection and what so many Americans already have: paid sick time. While 75 percent of private industry workers have paid sick time, more than 100,000 rail-road employees who work 24/7 operations in all types of weather don't have a single day of paid sick time. And, let's be clear, it's not be-cause the Class I railroads can't afford it. In the last three years, five of the Class I railroad CEOs were paid more than $200 mil-lion. One of the CEOs made 144 times what the average railroad worker makes. Since 2010, the seven Class I railroads spent $230 billion to line the pockets of their owners and shareholders through stock buybacks and divi-dends. That includes the $26 billion they sent to shareholders in 2021, on top of $29 billion they reported in profits. The railroad CEOs\u2014who I'm sure have paid sick leave\u2014are watching their record profits soar, while worrying that their stock prices may drop slightly if they give their workers paid sick leave. Why? Thanks to the vultures on Wall Street, the seven Class I railroads have all implemented so-called precision scheduled railroading\u2014or PSR\u2014an operating strategy that focuses on cutting costs in order to increase profits, which are returned to shareholders. In implementing PSR, the seven Class I rail- roads have cut their workforces so deeply\u2014by nearly one-third\u2014that it has significantly im-pacted service. While the railroads were dithering on their contract negotiations, rail-road shippers, including the agricultural, en-ergy, and construction industries\u2014have all at-tested to how these workforce impacts have contributed to delayed shipments, disruptions to business, and extra shipping costs that get passed on to consumers. And what has been the railroads' solution to these self-imposed wounds? To force their re-maining employees to work harder and longer, and unilaterally impose harsh attendance poli-cies that penalize workers if they have the au-dacity to call in sick. This is an industry where an inch in the wrong direction can cost you your life or limb\u2014yet the railroads are incentivizing people to come to work sick. It's as dangerous as it is unconscionable. The railroads argued to the Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) that their record prof-its were not due to ''any contributions by labor.'' Despite a 75 percent decrease in work-er-hours and a 602 percent increase in work-er-hour productivity, the railroads argued that productivity was not the result of labor and they claimed that their employees are not overworked or fatigued. However, hour-of- service violations have increased by 60 per-cent over the last decade. It's 2022, but the robber barons are back. We're here today because we recognize what makes this country run. It's frontline workers. Without them, just under one third of our country's freight would sit idle. We know the current conditions cannot continue\u2014be-cause without improvements to their ability to reliably spend time with family, be sick without punishment, schedule a doctor appointment, or plan a vacation, railroad workers will con-tinue to leave this industry. And when the best of our essential workers leave, we all suffer. I believe it's well past time that these workers have paid sick leave and it's something the railroads can easily afford. In 2021 the seven Class I railroads could have paid for their workers to have seven days of paid sick leave by spending just 6/10 of a penny for every dollar they reported in profit and shareholder returns. These highly compensated railroad CEOs should not be op-posed to paid sick days for their front-line em-ployees\u2014employees who are responsible for their very success. The reality is that the robber barons are nothing without the labor of their employees, who deserve better. But recognizing that the parties are no closer to a solution today than they were three years ago, and that railroad workers make this country run, the House will consider this joint resolution to bring an end to this fight in its current form, lock in the ten-tative agreements that provide historic pay in-creases, guarantee reimbursement for work expenses, and prevent a massive disruption to our economy that would hurt millions of work-ing people and their families. I will proudly vote to lock in the tentative agreements and provide railroaders seven paid sick days. The CEOs can take a shift in the rail yard to cover them. RECOGNIZING DISTRICT 10 COM- MISSIONER JAVIER SOUTO FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Miami-Dade County Commis-sioner Javier D. Souto for his exemplary public service to the Miami community. Since his election to the County Board of Commis-sioners in April 1993, Senator Souto has served District 10\u2014which includes portions of Kendall, Westchester, and Fontainebleau\u2014 with distinction for over 29 years. Before that, he was elected twice to the Florida Senate. Senator Souto's work on behalf of his con- stituents has been wide-ranging and com-prehensive. His passion for our parks and places that bring people together is truly in-spiring. He has built a legacy of helping others in need and fighting against the brutal dictator-ship of the Castro regime in Cuba. Commis-sioner Souto is a veteran of the Bay of Pigs Invasion and his contributions to the Cuban exile community are immeasurable. I had the pleasure of serving as County Commissioner and then Mayor of Miami-Dade County, where I worked with Senator Souto extensively and witnessed firsthand his hard work and determination. His love for Miami is evident through his life of dedication to its people. It is my deep pleasure to honor Sen-ator Souto as he retires from the Board of Commisioners, and I wish him all the very best. f HONORING MICHAEL POWERS, PRESIDENT OF THE ARC OF THE OZARKS HON. BILLY LONG OF MISSOURI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Michael Powers, President of The Arc of the Ozarks.

He has been instru-mental in the creation of innovative programs like Renovations, which is the first program of its kind in Missouri for individuals with dual di-agnosis. His influence has elevated The Arc VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:37 Dec Extensions of Remarks E1194 December 1, 2022 as an industry leader that continues to im- prove community access and quality of life to people with disabilities at all stages of life. Through impeccable financial stewardship and leadership, Michael has built a team of leaders in the disability services industry. Mi-chael displays his dedication to the disability community through his longtime state and fed-eral legislative advocacy on issues that impact individuals with disabilities. He serves on nu-merous nonprofit advisory and leadership boards with the city of Springfield and the statewide group of industry professionals, the Missouri Association of Rehabilitation Facilities (MARF) who has selected him as President Elect. The Arc of the Ozarks was named the larg- est local charity nonprofit for 2022 by the Springfield Business Journal and the largest disability service provider in Missouri that pro-vides jobs for 1,460 employees. This organiza-tions' mission is to support individuals with dis-abilities to direct their own lives as valued members of the community. Michael Powers has embraced and passionately lives out that mission daily. As a result of Michael's exceptional guid- ance, he has been instrumental in countless accomplishments that have benefitted thou-sands of individuals with disabilities over the years with access to a variety of services and supports that empower people with disabilities to live their best lives. Madam Speaker, his commitment and dedi- cation are exemplified in the lives that have been touched with disabilities and their fami-lies. I am proud to honor his lifetime of accom-plishments today. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. DARIN LaHOOD OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. L AHOOD.

JENNIFER WEXTON OF VIRGINIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the admirable work done by Leesburg Chief of Police, Gregory C. Brown. On December 1, 2022, Chief Brown is set to officially retire and conclude a 26-year career of law enforcement service to the Leesburg and Loudoun communities. Throughout his tenure, he has successfully implemented innovative leadership and man-agement techniques. Additionally, he has ex-panded the department to include 90 sworn officers and 18 civilians. As described by his fellow colleagues, Chief Brown has ''consist-ently utilized Community Policing philosophies and strongly believes that the needs of the community should be at the heart of every- thing we do''. Chief Brown is known for his commitment to building trusting and meaningful partnerships within the community. To do so, he has over-seen numerous projects for technological ad-vancements within the department, all with the intent of aiding the general public. It is evident that Chief Brown embraces the concept of ''Servant Leadership''. He began his long-tenured law enforcement career with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Police Department in 1996. Later, he joined the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office. Here, he served for nearly 20 years, achieving the rank of Captain before being appointed Leesburg Chief of Police. Upon his official retirement, Chief Brown will remain in the area to serve the community in a new role. He will be re-suming the title of the Executive Director of the Northern Virginia Criminal Justice Training Academy (NVCJTA), where he will oversee the training of members of the Town of Lees-burg Police Department and 16 other regional law enforcement agencies. I want to formally recognize the contribu- tions that Chief of Police Gregory C. Brown has made to our community and the nation. He is the embodiment of integrity and dedica-tion, consistently striving to improve the well- being of citizens throughout the 10th district of Virginia and our Nation. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. DANIEL T. KILDEE OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, on November 29, 2022, I missed a roll call vote on S. 4003. Had I been present, I would have proudly voted for this bill to provide law enforcement the resources and flexibility needed to train their officers. Had I been present, I would have voted ''yea'' on rollcall No. 486. f TRIBUTE TO KTLA ON ITS 75TH ANNIVERSARY HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my heartfelt congratulations to KTLA television station, ''L.A.'s Very Own,'' as it celebrates 75 years of broadcasting from the heart of my district on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California. Founded on January 22, 1947 as the very first television station west of the Mississippi li-censed for commercial broadcasts, KTLA-TV Channel 5 blossomed and flourished right alongside the city of Los Angeles as the area's population grew during the post-war years. Entering a media landscape then dic-tated by theater and radio, its televised broad-casts were\u2014and remain\u2014groundbreaking, il-lustrated by an inaugural telecast that featured legends like Cecil B. DeMille and Bob Hope. KTLA has since been an integral force in shaping L.A.'s diverse media landscape, Southern Californians' conversations around the issues that matter most, and the trajectory of the television news industry writ large. KTLA is particularly famous for being on the cutting edge of new technology over its many decades on air. Beyond being a pioneer of live, breaking-news coverage, the station prides itself on many firsts: first broadcast on- the-spot news from the field, first telecast from a ship at sea, first simulcast in Spanish, and first use of a helicopter to broadcast news\u2014 the latter of which has become an L.A. news calling card. KTLA reporters have also been some of the first on the scene for every history-making event in Southern California, with a well-estab-lished reputation for unflinching, accurate, and reliable coverage. When a three-year-old fell into an abandoned well in San Marino in 1949, reporter and legend Stan Chambers was there to broadcast the tragedy for 27 consecutive hours\u2014the world's first extended broadcast. KTLA was the first to broadcast the tape showing Rodney King's beating at the hands of police, earning the station a prestigious Peabody Award for its handling of the footage. It was the only television station to provide ''gavel-to-gavel'' coverage of the infamous O.J. Simpson criminal trial. And in more recent memory, the station has provided Southern Californians with invaluable minute-by-minute coverage of local and national politics, wildfires and the COVID-19 pandemic. These achievements have earned KTLA nu- merous awards, including many Golden Mikes, over 150 Emmys, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and an Academy Award\u2014the first and only Oscar ever given to a TV station. And beyond its enriching reporting, KTLA finds ways to give even more to our communities by supporting numerous charitable organizations throughout Southern California. Today, KTLA produces over 100 hours of local programming each week, and the station regularly draws thousands of viewers who rely on its informative daily broadcasts\u2014along with the millions of viewers who enjoy its special coverage of premier events, like the annual Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parade. Our city and its residents are so fortunate to benefit from such a prestigious, purposeful, and dynamic local news institution right in our backyard. I cannot wait to watch KTLA con-tinue to grow and flourish for many more dec-ades to come, especially as it prepares to air from its revamped set. I am proud to recognize ''L.A.'s Very Own'' for its immeasurable contributions to the tele-vision and news industry and to the greater Los Angeles area, and I ask all members to join me in congratulating KTLA on its 75th an-niversary. f IN REMEMBRANCE OF CHARLOTTE NEWFELD HON. MIKE QUIGLEY OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of LGBTQ activist, com-munity leader and friend, Charlotte Newfeld. Since the early 1970s, Charlotte was a fierce advocate for the gay and lesbian com-munity in Chicago. I first had the pleasure of VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:37 Dec Extensions of Remarks E1195 December 1, 2022 working with Charlotte during the No Lights at Wrigley campaign in the 1980s. In that time, I was witness to the commitment she had to working for the community. We both served on the Lakeview Citizens Council where she taught me the importance of putting the local community above all else. Her contributions have included advocating for the appointment of a mayoral liaison and her active lobbying to secure passage of Chi-cago's human rights ordinance, which pro-hibits discrimination because of sexual orienta-tion. She lived in Lakeview for nearly 60 years, and in that time, worked to improve education, open spaces, neighborhood protec-tions and AIDS awareness in the area. Charlotte was a true trailblazer and will be dearly missed, but the impact she had on Chi-cago and on the LGBTQ community, will be felt for generations to come. I am thinking of her family, particularly her daughter Julie, dur-ing this time. f RECOGNIZING DISTRICT 6 COMMIS- SIONER REBECA SOSA FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Commissioner Rebeca Sosa for an extraordinary career in public service. Commissioner Sosa has been serving the residents of Miami-Dade County across many different areas for over 20 years and has done so honorably. I had the privilege of working closely with Commissioner Sosa for many years during my tenure in Miami-Dade County and know how dedicated she is to protecting our community and our environment. Commissioner Sosa won her first election as the District 6 commissioner. She has been re-elected 4 times to the county commission and has represented residents all over the county. In 2012, while I was mayor of the county, she was elected chairwoman of the county commission. She served a two-year term as chairwoman and during those two years, we worked closely together to get things done for the residents of Miami-Dade County. Over the years, Commissioner Sosa has been a driving force in the expansion and modernization of Miami International Airport and PortMiami. Commissioner Sosa has made her residents proud by the tenacity with which she has fought for them and ensuring Miami-Dade County continues to be the best place to live, work, and raise a family. It was an honor to serve with her, and I know she will excel in the next chapter of her life. Lourdes and I wish her the best and look forward to seeing what she does next. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. BRAD FINSTAD OF MINNESOTA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. FINSTAD. Madam Speaker, blizzard conditions caused airport cancellations in my home state of Minnesota on November 29, 2022. Had I been present, I would have voted NAY on Roll Call No. 486 (S. 4003); YEA on Roll Call No. 487 (S. 3846); and NAY on Roll Call No. 488 (H.R. 5455). f HONORING PROFESSIONAL BASS FISHING HALL OF FAMER STACEY KING HON. BILLY LONG OF MISSOURI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Professional Bass Fishing Hall of Fame and Missouri Sports Hall of Fame inductee Stacey King. Stacey was born in Springfield, Missouri on February 21, 1949. When he was a young boy, he spent many weekends and summers with a cousin of his fathers and her husband who was an avid hunter and fisherman. Stacey loved hunting and fishing from the be-ginning. In his late teens he began some part- time guiding for trout on Lake Taneycomo. Table Rock Lake had recently been im-pounded and at that time was rated the #1 fishing destination in the U.S. Stacey was spending every spare minute learning to bass fish on Table Rock Lake. In 1970 he joined the Ozarks Bass Club, one of the very first or-ganized bass clubs in the U.S. Stacey guided full-time during the 1970's along with fishing local and regional bass tournaments. In the early 1980's he began competing in the Ray Scott's Bassmaster events that had become extremely popular nationwide. For the next twenty years he competed on a national level qualifying for twelve Bassmaster Classics. Then for the next several years he competed on the Fishing League Worldwide tour with much success. During that timeframe, he had many suc- cessful sponsorships. First and foremost, with Bass Pro Shops. His career has enabled him to travel and fish from Europe to China and everywhere in-between. He has filmed many videos, tv shows, and appeared on Fox News representing Bass Pro Shops several times. In 2015 he was inducted into the Profes- sional Bass Fishing Hall of Fame. And in 2020 he was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame. A major part of his career has been helping people learn to fish and enjoy the outdoors. A lot of his time now is spent donating fishing trips to organizations and taking kids and vet-erans fishing. Madam Speaker, not only has Stacey dedi- cated his life to what he loves, he has also given back so much to the fishing community. His storied career is well deserving of being honored today. HONORING MAUREEN SCALLEN FAILOR OF THE DAKOTA COUN-TY REGIONAL CHAMBER OF COM-MERCE HON. ANGIE CRAIG OF MINNESOTA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Maureen Scallen Failor on a suc-cessful five-year tenure as President of the Dakota County Regional Chamber of Com-merce as she wraps up her impressive run on December 16. Maureen is an incredible advocate for her small business members across Dakota Coun-ty. Throughout her time as President, she suc-cessfully navigated her membership through the pandemic, oversaw membership growth throughout the region and increased DCRC's presence within the community. Maureen's input on pandemic related legislation and ad-vocacy to ensure Chambers received PPP loans was vital to Minnesota's Second District. I'll always appreciate our coffee and conversa-tions and am thankful for her willingness to moderate many of my monthly town halls. Small business leaders like Maureen and chambers like DCRC are vital to our local Main Street economies. I'm grateful for the nu-merous opportunities I had to work with Maureen and wish her the best in her future endeavors. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. BETTY McCOLLUM OF MINNESOTA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Ms. M CCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 110 and H.J. Res. 119 which adopts the Tentative Railway Labor Agreement forged by months of hard-fought negotiations between railway workers and rail-road companies and provides paid sick leave for workers. These votes put rail workers' rights over corporate profits. I am proud to support the Tentative Agreement which will provide impor-tant advances for freight rail workers. These advances include a 24 percent pay raise, a $5,000 bonus, no changes in copays, deductibles, or coinsurance, and seven days of paid medical leave. Additionally, my votes for these resolutions are to avert a devastating rail shutdown that would slam the brakes on our economy and impact the lives of nearly every American. Communities in Minnesota and across our na-tion need reliable access to safe drinking water. A rail shutdown would disrupt deliveries of essential products like chlorine, that are necessary to keep our water supplies safe and clean. Further, a rail stoppage would prevent timely deliveries of groceries, medications, and other vital goods. Some families would be hit even harder as it is estimated that as many as 765,000 Americans, many of them union work-ers, would lose their jobs within weeks. My votes for H.J. Res. 110 and H.J. Res. 119 are to put workers' rights, the safety of our communities, and Americans' economic security over corporate profits. Railroad work-ers deserve fair compensation, benefits, and VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:37 Dec Extensions of Remarks E1196 December 1, 2022 sick leave, and I will continue to fight for their rights. f TRIBUTE TO DON HORSLEY ON HIS RETIREMENT HON.

He has worked in law en-forcement, education, as elected Sheriff and President of the Healthcare District Board. His life has been one devoted to the wellbeing of others. Don Horsley is married to Elaine and they reside in Emerald Hills. They have three adult children and one grandchild. Don is a native San Franciscan who was raised in Daly City. He graduated from Westmoor High School and earned his Bachelor's degree with Honors from San Francisco State University. He later earned a secondary school teaching creden-tial.

Don began his career with the San Mateo County Sheriffs office as a Patrol Deputy in East Palo Alto in 1972. He won the race for San Mateo County Sheriff in 1993 and served as the elected Sheriff for nearly 14 years. His tenure was marked by innovation, moderniza-tion and upgrading the tools used by law en-forcement. He helped establish a gang inves-tigative unit, and his work resulted in the low-est county homicide rate in California. Don Horsley was elected to the Sequoia Healthcare District where he served as Presi-dent until he was elected to the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors. At the Healthcare District he spearheaded efforts to increase funding to the North Fair Oaks Clinic and the Community Grant Program, and advo-cated annexation of the San Mateo Coastside into the District, and worked successfully to fund school nurses and health programs in District schools. Don Horsley was elected to the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors for District 3 in 2010 and has served with great distinction for three terms. The District includes the cities of Atherton, southeast Belmont, Half Moon Bay, Pacifica, Portola Valley, San Carlos and Woodside.

Don Horsley hosted Getting Prohibited Guns Off the Street: Firearm Relinquishment in San Mateo County, an inter-agency partnership with the Giffords Law Center on March 11, 2022. Subsequently, the Board of Supervisors committed $1 million to taking guns away from people with violent offenses and restraining or-ders. Don Horsley is a tireless advocate for farm- workers on the Coast and helped develop the San Mateo County Farm Labor Housing Loan Program. The program finances the construc-tion of new and renovated housing for farm-workers, in partnership with agricultural opera-tors. Don is an outspoken supporter of civilian oversight of law enforcement, a strong advo-cate for affordable housing, and is committed to ensuring that policies and funding for hous-ing, transportation, job training and other serv-ices reach the most vulnerable residents. Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House to join me in thanking Don Horsley for his exem-plary service to the people of San Mateo County and in wishing him every blessing in the next chapter of his life. He is a good and great man and we are a better community and a stronger country because of him and his work. f HONORING KRISTI HOWELL HON. ANDY KIM OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Kristi Howell, a champion for small businesses who has dedicated her career to empowering business owners that shape New Jersey's economy every day. As we celebrate her 20th anniversary of joining the Burlington County Regional Cham-ber of Commerce (BCRCC) as President and CEO, it's important to note how her work has transformed the Chamber's impact on our dis-trict and across the state. Kristi has been at the forefront of leading rebranding efforts, strengthening key partnerships, including with Joint Base McGuire-Dix Lakehurst, and ex-panding programming from 20 annual net-working and educational events to 60. Through Lunch N' Learns, Women's Business Conferences, Workforce Development Con-ferences, and more, Kristi has created a wel-coming space for businesses and their em-ployees to find success. Beyond her service through the Chamber of Commerce, Kristi has also been an active member of our community. From advising law-makers in Trenton before deciding to apply her government background and communica-tion skills to the business world, she has had an impact on multiple sectors of service. Kristi continues to give back as a board member and advisor for numerous organizations in-cluding the Military Support Alliance of NJ, the YMCA of the Pines, the Girl Scouts of Central and Southern New Jersey, Visit South Jersey, and the Burlington County Institute of Tech-nology. Kristi's passion for service has also been recognized through a number of prestigious awards and honors over the years. More re-cently, Kristi was recognized by South Jersey Biz Magazine as Executive of the Year, by SJ Magazine's Women of Excellence for her Leadership, and by Gloucester County's Chamber of Commerce Foundation for her commitment to small businesses. Having worked with Kristi on the Small Busi- ness Advisory Council in 2019, I am humbled to know firsthand the value of her leadership and expertise. We are grateful for the work that Kristi has done. I know I speak for the 3rd District in congratulating her for a remarkable milestone of 20-years leading the BCRCC. f RECOGNIZING CHAIRMAN JOSE ''PEPE'' DIAZ FOR AN EXTRAOR-DINARY CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of my good friend, Chairman Jose ''Pepe'' Diaz for his out-standing work as a Miami-Dade County Com-missioner and Chairman of the Board of County Commissioners. During my tenure as Mayor of Miami-Dade County, I had the pleas-ure of working closely with Chairman Diaz on many important issues over the years. We were able to come together to serve the resi-dents of Miami-Dade County and formed a strong friendship that has continued even after my time at the County. Chairman Diaz is the quintessential public servant. He started his career in public service at a young age as a member of the U.S. Ma-rine Corps and has continued down a path of lifelong service to the community he so deeply admires. Chairman Diaz has served on nu-merous boards and been appointed to count-less committees, which is a testament to his leadership and dedication to improving the lives of the residents of South Florida. Chair-man Diaz has spearheaded countless projects and initiatives for Miami-Dade County over the span of his 20 years serving on the County Commission and most recently led a bid com-mittee to support Miami as a future host city for the World Cup. He has always been deep-ly committed to serving the county's veterans and active-duty service members. It is my honor to recognize and honor Chair- man Diaz for his service to the South Florida community. I had the distinct honor of working with Chairman Diaz for a large portion of my career, and I know the kind of focus and lead-ership he has brought to his entire career of public service. Although his time as a county commissioner is coming to an end, I know he will continue to thrive in his upcoming endeav-ors. I look forward to seeing what the future has in store and wish Chairman Diaz all the very best. f PAYING TRIBUTE TO MELVIN C. HIGH, SHERIFF OF PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY HON. STENY H. HOYER OF MARYLAND IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I want to rec- ognize the loss of an exceptional law enforce-ment official and community leader in Prince George's County, Maryland: Sheriff Melvin C. High. After a barrier-breaking career in law en-forcement spanning 53 years, Sheriff High VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:37 Dec Extensions of Remarks E1197 December 1, 2022 passed away on November 17, 2022, just weeks before he was set to start a well-de-served retirement. Although many throughout the region and throughout the country will mourn his loss, his legacy endures through his profound impact on the communities he served and on policing broadly. Most impor-tantly, his memory lives on through his wife, Brenda, and his daughter. Tracy. Throughout his life, Melvin displayed an unyielding commitment to serving others. After teaching high school science in Mississippi, he served his country in Vietnam as a United States Marine. When he returned, he joined the Metropolitan Police Department here in Washington, DC in 1969. As one of the only Black officers in the ranks, he had to work his beat on foot since the police cruisers were re-served exclusively for his white colleagues. When he left the department after 24 years, however, he did so as Assistant Chief of Po-lice\u2014the first Black person in the department's history to serve as second-in-command. Mel-vin then spent a decade as Chief of Police in Norfolk, Virginia, before he came to Prince George's County in 2003. Melvin was appointed Chief of the Prince George's County Police Department at a time of immense distrust between law enforcement and the community. He worked to restore the public's faith in his department by improving accountability, addressing mismanagement, and implementing policies to build safer com-munities. From rewriting the department's use- of-force policy to instituting the county's first system to detect and track the early signs of abuse, High's stringent standards and innova-tive leadership got his department back on track. Prince Georgians were so pleased with his work that they elected him to serve as their county's sheriff in 2010 and again in 2014 and 2018. In that role, he continued to make accountability a priority and worked to bring attention to pressing issues facing his community, including domestic abuse. Melvin faced many obstacles over the years, but he worked to dismantle them for those who followed in his footsteps. Through-out his career, he cultivated greater diversity in law enforcement, developed more equitable and more effective community policing meth-ods, and mentored numerous officers. While Melvin's many achievements are impressive, his humility is what makes them so inspiring. Despite being one of the most accomplished law enforcement professionals in the country, he still saw himself as a father and husband first. I am sure that he would remind us that he was just one of the many law enforcement officers across America who serve quietly to keep their communities and country safe. Nevertheless, I ask all my colleagues to join me in mourning his loss, honoring his life's work, and wishing strength to his family. f RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF CAPTAIN RYAN CASEY HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN OF VIRGINIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Captain Ryan Casey and his service to Virginia's First District and the Nation. Ryan earned his bachelor's degree in Fi- nance, Economics, and Political Science from Carthage College. After graduating from Carthage College, he commissioned as an of-ficer in the U.S. Marine Corps. While in the U.S. Marine Corps, he worked his way up from Student Officer to Weapons Platoon Commander, eventually earning the rank of Captain. Ryan then graduated from the Expeditionary Warfare School at Marine Corps University. He subsequently earned his master's degree in Public Policy from the Schar School of Pol-icy and Government at George Mason Univer-sity. Ryan joined my office as a Department of Defense Legislative Fellow in January 2022. As a Defense Fellow, he served our Nation both as a Marine and a public servant. He contributed mightily and invaluably to my House Armed Services Committee work, which included my role as the Ranking Mem-ber of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee. I would like to thank Ryan for his contribu- tions and dedicated service over the last year. He has been a key member of my defense team and staff, and I wish him all the best as he continues his journey here in the Capitol as a House Liaison Officer in the U.S. Marine Corps House Liaison Office. Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in recognizing Captain Ryan Casey for his serv-ice to Virginia's First District and the Nation. May God bless Ryan as he continues his ca-reer in public service and the U.S. Marine Corps. f HONORING JACK STACK, PRESI- DENT AND CEO OF SRC HOLD-INGS CORPORATION HON. BILLY LONG OF MISSOURI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Jack Stack, the President and CEO of SRC Holdings Corporation. Jack, a graduate of Elmhurst College, came to SRC in 1979 as the Plant Manager of Inter-national Harvester after eleven years of direct supply chain management experience. In 1983, Stack and the SRC employees bought the company from IH and have turned it into what INC. magazine has proclaimed ''one of America's most competitive small companies''. They currently employ more than 1,800 peo-ple, with annual sales over $600,000,000. SRC remanufactures gasoline and diesel en-gines for the automotive and off-highway mar-kets, distributes engine kits, manufactures power units and remanufactures electrical components, and conducts seminars and training programs specializing in all aspects of teaching people how to implement open-book management. Jack has authored three books on business, The Great Game of Business (1992), A Stake in the Outcome (2002) and Change The Game: Saving the American Dream by Closing the Gap (2019).

These are just a few of his many rec-ognitions. On top of his business work, Jack has been active in his local community, previously serv-ing as director of Care to Learn, a local not- for-profit agency that provides relief to children with emergent hunger, health, and hygiene needs. Jack is the founder of the Boys and Girls Clubs Invest to Invest Club which was created in order to generate a new source of funds for their youth programs and to serve as a tool to teach business basics to Club mem-bers and provide a friendly and competitive venue for the Invest to Invest group members. Madam Speaker, Jack Stack has achieved truly great things, and I am proud to honor him today. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. RICHARD HUDSON OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I was un- avoidably detained and missed a vote. Had I been present, I would have voted NAY on Roll Call No. 490. f REMEMBERING MRS. CAROLINE STOKES HON. HALEY M. STEVENS OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in memory of Mrs. Caroline Stokes of West Bloomfield, Michigan. Mrs. Stokes is re-membered as a kind, strong, and loving per-son who will be truly missed by all who knew her. While it is difficult to bid farewell to Mrs. Stokes, it is an honor to commemorate her life today, and I thank my colleagues for helping pay their respects to this remarkable woman. Caroline was born on January 18, 1945, in Wyandotte, Michigan. She grew up in Wyan-dotte with her two beloved siblings, Irene Hart-ley and Ralph Romanowski, both of whom proceeded her in death. At an early age, Caroline found companionship in Karen Bolin, who was born and raised across the street. Karen, now of Indiana, was fortunate to have this friendship with Caroline that stretched over 77 years. Caroline was the cherished wife of Mr. Lance Stokes and beloved mother of Bonnie (Jason) Garcia, David (Angela) Medved, John (Shannon) Medved, Anna Medved, Tehophil Stokes, and Megan Stokes. In addition, she was a devoted ''nana'' to Ricky, Caroline, Alec, Jonathon, Beonka, Evan, Aubree, Benjamin, Julia, Emelia, Jack, Alexander, and Ellie Grace, along with ''grand- nana'' to Cora Lynn. Caroline valued the bond she shared with her family and was proud to be the caring aunt to Rose, Laura, Lorraine, and Douglas, and to her grandnephew, Jazz. VerDate Sep 11 2014 of Remarks E1198 December 1, 2022 Mrs. Stokes' primary profession was as an insurance agent, but she found great joy in pursuing her passion as a photographic artist, taking her on many new adventures in her adult life. Mr. and Mrs. Stokes conducted photo shoots across the United States, in Canada, and even Italy. Canada's ''wild and untamed beauty'' captivated Caroline, as she often expressed a desire to live in the beau-tiful country. The ''McCutcheon Clan'' in On-tario were wonderful friends to the Stokes and considered them honorary McCutcheons, sharing many years of friendship. In addition to her knack for photography, Caroline was an avid reader, painter, and en-thusiastic traveler. As a woman of faith, Caro-line greatly cherished her travel to Assisi, as St. Francis of Assisi was her favorite saint. She was a music lover, enjoying a variety of genres and artists. Her family says that her music tastes ranged from Willie Nelson and Neil Diamond to opera, Pavarotti, Julio Iglesias, and Yanni as well as Soul and Polish music. Madam Speaker, Mrs. Caroline Stokes led by example, demonstrating the impact one person can make on the lives of so many by embodying the values that connect us. Caro-line's devotion to her family and friends, along with her passion for travelling and the arts will continue to inspire those who knew her for a long time to come. I ask my colleagues to please join me in honoring the life of Mrs. Caroline Stokes. f IN MEMORY OF BARBARA THARPE RAINES HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. OF GEORGIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-brance that I rise today to honor the life and legacy of a loving wife, dedicated mother, dot-ing grandmother and a woman after God's own heart, First Lady Emeritus Barbara Tharpe Raines. Sadly, First Lady Raines passed from labor to reward after a long and fruitful journey of service to humankind. A service celebrating her remarkable life will be held on Saturday, December 3, 2022 in Macon, Georgia at 12:00 p.m. at the Macon Centreplex. She leaves a legacy of service that is worthy of emulation. Barbara Tharpe Raines was born on Janu- ary 30, 1951, in Macon, Georgia to the late James Bryant and Alma Jones Tharpe. She was the oldest of six children. First Lady Raines was a lifelong learner and was a proud product of the Bibb County School System, graduating from Ballard Hud-son High School in 1968. The next stop on her educational journey was Fort Valley State College (now University), graduating in 1972 with a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Edu-cation. She also received a Master's Degree in Counseling from Georgia College and State University with more study at Georgia South-ern University . Equipped with great educational tools, she embarked on a thirty-year education career, serving in multiple roles, including First Grade Teacher, Second Grade Teacher and Guid-ance Counselor. She retired from the Bibb County School system with her final duty sta- tion at Burghurd Elementary School. Never one to rest on her laurels or one to stop trying to help those in need, she came out of retire-ment to do independent counseling for the school system, setting up independent coun-seling programs and serving as she did so often in her life as a mentor for new coun-selors. First Lady Raines was also an instruc-tor with Hicks and Hicks Associates of Atlanta, Georgia, where she taught child development courses. Central to her life and character was her commitment to God that she formed at an early age. An unbreakable bond was ce-mented with her beloved husband and life partner, the Reverend Curtis Raines as they were both founding members of the Mount Vernon Baptist Church. She and Rev. Raines were members of the church's Youth Depart-ment and played an integral role in the Church's spiritual and social development. First Lady Raines and Reverend Raines formed a true partnership as she became a deaconess and he became a deacon under the leadership of their pastor at Mount Vernon, the Reverend Dr. Henry Ficklin. Applying the lessons that he learned at Mount Vernon, Reverend Raines began his own ministerial journey along with First Lady Raines who supported him at every turn, as a sterling example of what a First Lady should be. She served as the First Lady of New Pil-grim Baptist Church for 34 years and Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church Bolingbroke for 31 years. First Lady Raines was involved with many ministries that had as their goal the development of the whole person. When Reverend Raines became President of the General Missionary Convention of Geor-gia, First Lady Raines was once again a full partner with her husband serving in numerous capacities with the Convention. George Washington Carver once said, ''How far you go in life depends on your being ten-der with the young, compassionate with the aged sympathetic with the striving and tolerant with the weak and strong, because someday in your life you will have been all of these.'' First Lady Emeritus Barbara Raines used her life's work to help people from all walks of life. She was a member of many social and civic organizations to include the Macon Alum-nae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., Bibb Retired Education Association and Retired Counselors, Mentor at the Macon Youth Development Center, Rainbow Grief Counselor, Co-Team Captain of American Cancer Society, Former Member of the Amer-ican Lung Association, and Cancer Relay for Life. Because of her remarkable service to oth- ers, she has been recognized by local, state and national organizations. Besides being one of God's Children, her greatest role in life was being a dedicated wife, loving mother and grandmother. As out-lined already, she supported and served as the greatest cheerleader to her husband of al-most 44 Years, Rev. Curtis Raines in various endeavors. Moreover, she always supported her children and grandchildren, Madam Speaker, I am proud to have known a woman with the grace, class and dignity of First Lady Emeritus Barbara Tharpe Raines. I ask my colleagues to join my wife Vivian and me, along with the 730,000 people of the Sec-ond Congressional District in extending our deepest condolences to her family, friends and all who mourn her loss. May they be com-forted by their faith, the grace of God and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks and months ahead. f RECOGNIZING DISTRICT 2 COMMIS- SIONER JEAN MONESTIME FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Commissioner Jean Monestime of the Miami-Dade Board of County Commis-sioners for his exemplary accomplishments and commitment to the betterment of the resi-dents of South Florida. Commissioner Monestime served as the Chairman of the Board of County Commissioners during my first term as Mayor. He is a true public servant that has worked tirelessly on behalf of his con-stituents in District 2 and our entire commu-nIty. Commissioner Monestime has been a fight- er his entire career. In 2010, he became the first Haitian American to serve on the Board of County Commissioners. He has fought relent-lessly to expand opportunities for others. Com-missioner Monestime has a long history of ad-vocating for equal justice and economic devel-opment throughout Miami-Dade County. He has served on numerous boards and nation-ally recognized organizations to make sure that the economy in South Florida works for all people and that there is equal opportunity for individuals of all backgrounds. I have known Commissioner Monestime for a very long time, and I am proud of our work together. He has helped bring much-needed economic growth to some of the most impov-erished areas of our county and has always focused his energy on the most vulnerable. I look forward to seeing how he continues his career and thank him for his years of service to the residents of Miami-Dade. f RECOGNIZING THE BRAVERY OF SPC SOLOMON DOSS HON. MIKE ROGERS OF ALABAMA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize SPC Solomon Doss. On the morning of August 13, 2022, while on duty as a Piedmont Police Officer, SPC Solomon J Doss received a call to respond to an active structure fire. When he arrived on the scene with his partner, they saw flames and heavy smoke coming from the house and assessed that there was no time to wait for additional help. On scene, they coordinated briefly with an off-duty officer that had already attempted to gain entry but had been forced to exit due to the severity of the smoke and fire. Without hesitation, SPC Doss entered the structure in search of the occupant but was forced back out for clean air and to clear his lungs. He then reentered the structure in a VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:37 Extensions of Remarks E1199 December 1, 2022 second attempt, during which he located the occupant of the home, an elderly woman that had become incapacitated due to smoke inha-lation. SPC Doss and his partner carried her safely out of the structure shortly before it was engulfed in flames, ultimately saving the wom-an's life. SPC Doss is the 2022 National Guardsman of the Year for this act of selfless bravery. SPC Solomon Doss serves with the Ala- bama National Guard's 1166th Military Police Company and is from Piedmont, Alabama. During the 1166th MP Company's mobilization to Kuwait in 2020, SPC Doss served as a U.S. CENTCOM Customs Border Clearance Agent supporting Operation Spartan Shield. Outside the National Guard, SPC Doss works as a Patrol Officer at Piedmont Police Department in Piedmont, AL. Madam Speaker, please join me in recog- nizing SPC Solomon Doss' act of selfless bravery. SPC Doss represents the best of our community, and I'm honored to recognize him. f RECOGNIZING THE EUROPEAN PRAYER BREAKFAST'S 25TH AN-NIVERSARY HON. GARY J. PALMER OF ALABAMA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. PALMER. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec- ognize the 25th anniversary of the European Prayer Breakfast. In honor of this milestone, I offer this brief history of the breakfast and its initial beginnings. In 1996, Prince Nikolaus von Liechtenstein co-hosted a prayer group in his home of sen-ior political, diplomatic, and NATO leaders of Europe, along with Sir Paul Petrie. The group met weekly in his dining room in Brussels, Belgium, for over a year in rich fellowship and mutual sharing of scripture, focused on and around, the Person of Jesus. Deep relation-ships between the participants in this small group were formed as a result. At the end of a year, one of the group sug- gested that there were others in Brussels who would enjoy and benefit from a similar experi-ence. As a result, an invitation to others from the same spheres of responsibility was issued to attend a Saturday breakfast. Nearly 100 attended this by-invitation-only event in 1997. They shared their unique sto-ries with one another and were greatly encour-aged. Following the gathering, the participants were asked if they would be interested in con-tinuing to meet. With their approval, the par-ticipants sent out initiations to 157 people, and 155 accepted. This 1st annual European Prayer Breakfast was held in 1997. Prince Nikolaus moderated in 4 languages in French, Dutch, German, and English. Prayers were offered and scriptures read in all 4 languages. The Honorable Georgina Dufoix, then the French Minister of the Interior under President Mitterrand, shared her testimony in French, simply and power-fully. At its conclusion, people were so moved that there was weeping among many. After closing in unison with The Lord's Prayer in 28 different languages simultaneously, no one moved. There was such a powerful presence evident among them. When the group was later asked . . . ''Would you like to do this again?'' There was a universal agreement .... Yes. Thus began the European Prayer Breakfast of European diplomats, elected officials, mili-tary officials, and friends in Brussels, Belgium. Sometime later Paul Petrie began to col- laborate with Doug Coe, a coordinator of the U.S. National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC. Doug offered Paul the opportunity to in-vite European members of Parliament and others to the U.S. National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC, and so began the relation-ship of mutual encouragement. As the European Prayer Breakfast contin- ued, Paul, Prince Nikolaus and others re-ceived requests from multiple European Na-tional Parliamentarians to receive invitations to the Brussels event and they came by the doz-ens, then hundreds. This would bring many re-quests to help start similar events in National Parliaments across Europe. In each case Paul would visit the respective country's capital and encourage the initial step to be a weekly prayer gathering for a year, in preparation for the larger event. The group would consist of like-minded followers of Jesus from political, diplomatic, and adminis-trative roles, with an intentional effort to in-clude opposing political parties. This smaller, weekly group who would pray, study scripture, and develop personal relationships, long be-fore initiating a larger gathering. The inclusion of opposing political parties into a small week-ly group would become a foundational prin-ciple of the prayer breakfast, in every location. Today there are 40 smaller prayer groups across Europe who gather in the same spirit, to study and discuss the teachings of Jesus, and to pray. It was in 2002 that, at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC, that Paul Petrie, along with friends Dennis Coll, Bill Hightower and others, would organize the European Suite & Dinner. Here, European political lead-ers would come together during the week of the U.S. National PrayerBreakfast to mutually share and encourage one another. Subse-quently, Paul Petrie would host the European Prayer Breakfast Leader's dinner at the Stanhope Hotel in Brussels during the week of the European Prayer Breakfast. In 2017, Paul Petrie was knighted into the Ancient Order of St. George, by His Royal and Imperial Highness The Archduke Karel Van Hapsburg of Austria, for his ''30 years of influ-ence for the Kingdom of God upon European Royal Families, Governments, and Par-liaments.'' Subsequently he was granted an Honorary Doctorate from Asbury Theological Seminary for his work to extend the message of Jesus to others. The spirit of the European Prayer Breakfast has been extended to many countries since its inception. The Israeli Knesset was one of those places. The Israeli-Christian Caucus came to visit the European Prayer Breakfast in Brussels, and subsequently made the deci-sion, with the support of Israeli President at the time, Ruven Rivlen, to initiate the Jeru-salem Prayer Breakfast in 2016, of which Paul Petrie was a Founding Member. It continues today. It is with deep appreciation that this procla- mation is offered in honor of Prince Nikolaus von Leichtenstein and Sir Paul Petrie, for their profound positive effect upon this movement across Europe, and for their deep and abiding friendship for over a quarter of a century. f RECOGNIZING TWENTY-THREE YEARS OF SERVICE FROM ELIM CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP HON. BRIAN HIGGINS OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak- er, today I am pleased to honor a pillar within the city of Buffalo, ELIM Christian Fellowship. ELIM has had unwavering support for all of Western New York since its creation in 1999, and their congregation is now celebrating their twenty-third year of service. I would like to congratulate them on their perseverance through struggles and wish them a successful night of celebration. Under the leadership of Senior Pastor T. Anthony Bronner. ELIM Christian Fellowship was founded as a non-denominational and bible-based ministry, inviting people of all communities. According to Senior Pastor Bronner, ''The name ELIM conceptually means a place of refreshing, reviving, and re-newing for weary travelers and has proven to be a fitting symbol of spiritual revitalization and restoration. It is known for its spirit-led praise, worship, and intercessory prayer. Peo-ple from all races, religions, age groups, and denominational affiliations engage weekly to see God's Face.'' On the Fellowship's first day of worship, over seven-hundred men, women, and chil-dren gathered at the former Buffalo Christian Center in downtown Buffalo. Many of the origi-nal members were also attendees of the Re-gional Morning Prayer Movement. It drew in people of all kinds from many different com-munities. This Regional Morning Prayer con-tinued uninterrupted since its inception, even through the COVID-19 pandemic. ELIM moved from the Christian Center to Turner Carroll High School in February of 2000. After only six months of occupancy, membership grew from 700 to over 1600. Due to the growth in membership at ELIM, in June 2000, they had the opportunity to purchase a property across from The Central Park Plaza for a new Worship and Youth Center. When the Center opened in August 2000, more than 700 members, several commu-nities, and political leaders attended the trail-blazing ceremony. In that same year, ELIM members and visitors had the opportunity to meet with First Lady, Hillary R. Clinton, and hear her words of encouragement. Also, under the leadership of Senior Pastor T. Anthony Bronner, ELIM Christian Fellow-ship, created a chapter in Rochester, NY in November 2002. The expansion was a major evolution for the Fellowship and expanded the tightly knit community. The expansion also demonstrated an expansion in its mission and who that mission can reach. With the evolution in leadership, ELIM saw a large increase in permanent members due to holding worship at an unconventional time in the afternoon. In September 2004, ELIM finally officially ob-tained a worship center in the heart of Roch-ester, cementing their welcomed expansion. Then on April 30, 2006, ELIM had the privi- lege of opening a new worship center with a VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:37 Dec Extensions of Remarks E1200 December 1, 2022 service of thanksgiving. Many community lead- ers and congregational members celebrated the event with prayer and a march from the Central Park Plaza to the new edifice. Moving forward to 2008, the Consecration and Ordina-tion Service for leader Bishop T. Anthony Bronner occurred with the Fellowship mem-bers as witnesses. Everyone was extremely excited and joyful over Pastor Bronner's initi-ation into the Bishopric. Undoubtedly, ELIM faced an unprecedented amount of hardship, but years of struggle were made worthwhile when ELIM Christian Fellow-ship just recently made its final payment on its multimillion-dollar mortgage. Now the ministry can move forward and serve the community without hesitation. They have a permanent home. Our community is grateful for the leadership of the ELIM Christian Fellowship and for their dedication to guiding countless Buffalonians in faith and service. f CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF HAL DONALDSON AND CONVOY OF HOPE HON. BILLY LONG OF MISSOURI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the founder of Convoy of Hope, Hal Donaldson. In 1994, Hal took a trip to India and was in- spired to start serving his local community. He bought $600 worth of groceries and distributed them to families in need. In 1996, Convoy of Hope opened its headquarters in Springfield, MO, and in 1997 a friend donated a tractor trailer to assist in transporting goods. It was the first of many tractor trailers which are now iconic. Since 1994, Convoy of Hope has ex-panded into a global charity, serving more than 100 countries. They have served more than 200 million people and given out nearly $2 billion in resources and essential supplies. They have responded to more than 600 disas-ters worldwide, including the 9/11 terror at-tacks, Hurricane Katrina in 2005 where they sent nearly 1,000 tractor trailer loads of food and supplies as well as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in 2017. They also provided more than 200 million meals during the COVID pandemic and are currently helping to provide meals for Ukrainians impacted by the war. These are but a few examples of the in-credible work done by Convoy of Hope. Convoy of Hope continues to expand their efforts, and in 2021, they completed construc-tion on their new World Distribution Center in Springfield and are currently working to build a new headquarters next door, which is ex-pected to be completed in 2023. Madam Speaker, since their humble begin- nings in 1994, Hal Donaldson and Convoy of Hope have become a global leader in re-sponding to disasters and providing food for the hungry. They continue to grow through the help of volunteers and generous donations. I am proud to honor them today, and thank them for all of their efforts to date and going forward. HONORING LIBERTY BANK AND TRUST ON CELEBRATING 50 YEARS OF QUALITY BANKING IN AMERICA AS THE FIRST BLACK RUN BANK IN LOUISIANA HON. TROY A. CARTER OF LOUISIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Liberty Bank and Trust, a financial institution celebrating 50 years of quality banking in America as the first Black-run bank in Louisiana. In November 1972, New Orleans was a city with a majority African American population. However, there were very few African Ameri-cans in elective office and limited resources for the development of African American busi-nesses and personal wealth building. Fol-lowing decades of segregation and limited vot-ing rights, New Orleans was a city awakening to increased opportunities for its African Amer-ican citizens. Dr. Norman C. Francis conceived the idea of starting an African American owned bank in New Orleans following the failure of at least two other efforts to start such an institution. In late 1971, he approached a bi-racial group of businesspeople and elected officials with the idea and was able to secure the resources to open Liberty Bank on November 16, 1972, in a bank trailer on the site of its first Head-quarters Building on Tulane Avenue in New Orleans. During its first week of operations, Liberty opened over 2,000 accounts, clearly demonstrating the need for an African Amer-ican owned financial institution in New Orle-ans. With $2 million dollars in assets, Liberty re- ported a substantial profit for its first year of operations and has reported profitable years 46 of its 50 years in existence The Liberty Bank Building on Tulane Avenue opened 2 years later. That same year, Liberty opened its first branch office on Gentilly Blvd. Liberty's mission is to provide cost-effective delivery of high quality, innovative, customer driven financial products and services to di-verse markets with a focus on disadvantaged minority communities who have traditionally been underserved. Concurrent with the bank's mission, Liberty strives to maintain the com-pany's status as a catalyst for economic and community development while generating fair returns to shareholders and being an excellent corporate citizen. Some of the members of the bi-racial group that worked with Dr. Francis in the early years to get the bank started included: C.C. Dejoie\u2014Publisher, Louisiana Weekly Judge Ernest N. ''Dutch'' Morial, Then State Senator Mike O'Keefe Judge Israel Augustine Owen Brennan, Jr., Prominent Restaurant owner William J. Connick Benjamin J. Johnson, Esq. Ambrose J. Pratt, Jr., MD Dr. Langston F. Reed, Local Dentist and Ac- tivist Norman P. Zucker Joseph O. Misshore Ms. Jesse W. Cook Joseph E. Berrigan, Jr. Ben D. Bridgeman Joseph G. Landrieu, Jr. Jennings Courville Tricon (Clem) Sehrt A key development in the early years was the financing of Doley Securities', the first Black seat on the New York Stock Exchange owned by Harold Doley, Jr., becoming the only African American in its history to do so. The bank's additional key notes include asset growth over first 20 years, mortgages proc-essed, work with National Bankers Association and community outreach efforts. Once committed to opening an African American owned bank, Dr. Francis secured the only African American working above the level of teller in any bank in the New Orleans community to run the bank. That was Alden McDonald, joining the bank at the ripe age of 29 years old. Effective May 2, 2022, the board of directors of Liberty Bank and Trust Com-pany announced that Todd O. McDonald was named the bank's president. Liberty's former President and CEO Alden J. McDonald Jr., Todd's father, continues to lead the Liberty Fi-nancial Holding Company. Dr. Francis is still chair of the Liberty Bank Board 50 years later, and Alden McDonald was one of the longest serving African American Bank Presidents in America. Liberty Bank established its Baton Rouge presence in 1994 and opened a third branch in 2004. Liberty then moved into Mississippi in 2003, acquiring First American Bank in Jack-son. This was followed by expansion into the Greater Kansas City market with the acquisi-tion of Douglass bank in Kansas City, Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri, in 2008. Liberty Bank and Trust Company expanded across Greater New Orleans with the 2009 ac-quisition of United Bank and Trust Company, securing four additional locations to serve that market. That was followed by the acquisition of Home Federal Savings in Detroit, Michigan, which increased the bank's reach to six states. In 2013, Liberty Bank entered the Chicago market with the acquisition of Covenant Bank of Illinois, and in 2015, the bank expanded to Montgomery and Tuskegee, Alabama through the purchase of First Tuskegee Bank. Liberty Bank's growth has been the result of acquisitions, fruitful partnerships, aggressive marketing, strong management, staff produc-tivity and the trust it enjoys in the community. It all adds up to an efficient, well-capitalized institution that is perfectly positioned to con-tinue fast-paced growths in both profits and assets. Liberty Bank is passionate about help-ing more people achieve more economic free-dom. Today Liberty Bank is the largest financial institution in the United States owned by Afri-can Americans. It has assets of more than $1 billion dollars, a customer base of over 40,000 accounts with 175 employees, and still grow-ing, while recognized as one of the fastest growing financial institutions in the country. Todd McDonald said in a press release, ''I've been singularly driven to build solid stakeholder partnerships and evolve financial products which meet the financial needs of an ever-changing world. This next 50 years will be extraordinary as we reshape our culture, talent and organizational capabilities which will make us more agile, more competitive, and more effective in our efforts to close the wealth gap in underserved communities across the country.''

ROSA L. DeLAURO OF CONNECTICUT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Ms. D ELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to join Con-gregation Or Shalom, located in Orange, Con-necticut in paying tribute to their outstanding leader, Rabbi Alvin Wainhaus as he marks his 40th Anniversary with the synagogue. Indeed, he has been the Temple's only rabbi since it opened its doors in 1981. The son of Holocaust survivors, Rabbi Wainhaus was raised in Boro Park, Brooklyn and attended Brooklyn College, where he re-ceived a degree in philosophy, as well as New York University, where he earned a master's degree in education, before he was ordained at Yeshiva Beth Meir in Tel Aviv, Israel some five decades ago. He served several syna-gogues before coming to Congregation Or Shalom where he has led the conservative synagogue with integrity, wisdom, and com-passion for the last forty years. In that time, Rabbi Wainhaus has officiated two hundred weddings, named as many babies, and pre-sided over more than five hundred Bar and Bat Mitzvahs. Through his dedicated leader-ship, both within the synagogue and the com-munity at large, he has touched the lives of many. Rabbi Wainhaus is also known as a profes- sional musician, having performed and made numerous recordings with the late Hebrew folk singer Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach as well as most recently recording a disc to accompany a text of Biblical Hebrew, published by Yale University Press. Rabbi Wainhaus frequently incorporates his inspirational and traditional music into his sermons and services. He is also fluent in Yiddish and is a noted lecturer on Yiddish humor. With his own background in education, Rabbi Wainhaus has focused much of his en-ergy on the teaching of Jewish tradition and faith, particularly with children. He guides the synagogue's educational program for all ages. His door is always open to those of the Jewish faith and to the entire community\u2014to those who wish to learn. For the past sixteen years he led the Kristallnacht Program which is open community-wide and recognizes unsung he-roes of the Holocaust. Through his spiritual leadership, as well as his love for music and teaching, Rabbi Alvin Wainhaus has left an indelible mark on our community. His infinite compassion and com-mitment to service inspires others to make a difference\u2014a gift that has and continues to make the Greater New Haven community a better place to live, learn, and grow. I am so pleased to have the opportunity to extend my deepest thanks to him for all of his good work and to join Congregation Or Shalom in con-gratulating him on his 40th Anniversary.

Madam Speaker, on Saturday, December 17, 2022, Brevard County families, businesses and local community organizations will gather to celebrate the Fourteenth Annual Family Christmas Extravaganza. This wonder-ful event, which will take place at Fred Poppe Regional Park in Palm Bay, FL, will provide an uplifting message of hope and future during this Christmas season. The House Church, Elevation Church, Eastwind Pentecostal Church, Victory in Christ Jesus, Centerpointe Church, Grace Bible Church, Jornada al Cielo, Church on the Rock, River of Life Christian Center, Brevard Worship Center, and Hope Ministries of Flor-ida, Wings of Grace Ministries, CITA Rescue Mission, and ANEW International have all united to bring the Annual Family Christmas Extravaganza to our City and County. Working with several community and busi- ness partners such as the City of Palm Bay Parks & Recreation, Thrifty Specialty Produce, Chick-Fil-A, Fruits of my Labor, Gator Auto-motive, Florida Blue, Frog Bones-Family Shooting Center, Travel Camp, Al Dia Today Newspaper, Hometown News, and Premiere Oaks 10 Cinema, the mission is to provide a positive venue for residents and children to celebrate Christmas, serve others and give back to their community. Over 60 local businesses and organizations have made donations of Toys, food, gift certifi-cates, equipment, finances, and goodie bags, and will feature Musicians and Artist such as Unified Sound with Joel Lopez, Peabod, KD3, Boannski, Eddie Anthony as Eddie Frost and much more. Senior Pastor Ken Delgado of The House at Palm Bay said: ''With today's news being filled with division, contention, and expressions of hatred, it is exciting to see the City of Palm Bay, along with the city's businesses and the citizens, create an event where love, joy and peace are expressed. The Family Christmas Extravaganza is the greatest expression that so many people yearn for and is what the an-gels proclaimed at the birth of Jesus, saying 'Peace and good will towards all men'.'' The Mayor of the City of Palm Bay, Rob Medina, issued a proclamation in support for this year's celebration, recognizing the Ex-travaganza has become the largest Christmas party on the Space Coast and December 17, 2022, as Family Christmas Extravaganza Day. The spirit of the holidays is all about giving and spending time with loved ones. This year's Extravaganza brings our community to-gether to remind us of that. I ask my col-leagues to join me in saluting all those who are doing their part to spread the Christmas spirit this holiday season and those who have worked so hard to make the Fourteenth An-nual Family Christmas Extravaganza possible. RECOGNIZING DISTRICT 4 COMMIS- SIONER SALLY HEYMAN FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Commissioner Sally A. Heyman for an outstanding career in public service. For over 35 years, Commissioner Heyman has faithfully served Miami-Dade County residents in a variety of capacities. Since her election to the County Board of Commissioners in Sep-tember 2002, her selflessness and dedication to District 4 residents has been unparalleled. Commissioner Heyman developed a pas- sion for public service at an early age, encour-aged by her parents to work with local char-ities and civic institutions. After teaching in the public school system and getting her Juris Doctorate degree from the University of Miami, Commissioner Heyman was elected to the Florida Legislature in 1994. As a state rep-resentative, she co-sponsored ordinances to address juvenile justice issues and support environmental protection efforts. Her convic-tion that every human being should be treated with dignity and respect led her to fight to eliminate the stigma of mental health illnesses. And as a breast cancer survivor herself, Com-missioner Heyman advocates yearly for breast cancer awareness and education. During her tenure on the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners, Commissioner Heyman worked relentlessly for her constitu-ents, advocating especially for reliable public transportation systems and affordable housing. One notable accomplishment was the devel-opment of Aventura station, a Brightline com-muter stop which will relieve traffic and pro-vide residents with an easy means of trans-portation. The station is expected to open this December. Miami-Dade County is a better place be- cause of Commissioner Heyman. I was lucky enough to work with her at the county level and personally witness her tenacity and dedi-cation. I wish Commissioner Heyman all the very best as she retires from the Board of Commissioners. f WORLD AIDS DAY DECEMBER 1, 2022 HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I want to thank you all for being here today at the NMAC Capitol Hill Champions Reception to commemorate World AIDS Day and cele-brate our progress over the years. It is invigorating to be among a room full of leaders fighting the good fight against AIDS worldwide; and as so many here have contrib-uted mightily to this effort, it is an honor, and quite humbling, to be this year's recipient of the John Lewis Good Trouble Award from NMAC. I first want us to remember our deal friend and long-time colleague, Congressman John VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:37 Extensions of Remarks E1202 December 1, 2022 Lewis. He was a true warrior fighting for a more just, equitable, fairer, and better world. John Lewis earnestly believed that healthcare is a human right. Through his inde-fatigable leadership, he demonstrated the ur-gency of elevating the U.S. commitment to protect people worldwide from HIV and AIDS. He was a role model in so many respects, in-cluding his persistence in combating AIDS globally. World AIDS Day provides us the opportunity to reflect on the AIDS epidemic and where progress has been made. This day also allows us to rededicate ourselves to eradicating the disease once and for all. Since the first World AIDS Day in 1988, we have greatly increased our investments in HIV/ AIDS prevention, care, treatment, and re-search. When the HIV/AIDS epidemic started, the outlook was very grim. There wasn't an under-standing of the disease, antivirals were not available, and life expectancy for those diag-nosed was frighteningly short. Today, there is a better understanding of HIV/AIDS, how it spreads, and how to treat it. There are medications such as PrEP, which is taken daily to prevent HIV, and PEP, which is taken up to 72 hours potential HIV expo-sure. Treatment has advanced tremendously to the point where many HIV patients have viral loads that are so low that they are undetectable. The U.S. government has worked hard to combat the spread of this devastating disease. Through legislation like the Ryan White CARE Act and the U.S. President's Emer-gency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), we have been able to improve HIV/AIDS edu-cation, quality of care, and distribution of re-sources to those who need them most, both domestically and globally. The NIH provides the largest public invest- ment in HIV/AIDS research globally. Dr. An-thony Fauci deserves credit for a large part of our country's AIDS response as Director of the Office of AIDS Research. As we all know, racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS, both in the United States and globally. In the U.S., African Americans account for higher proportions of HIV diagnoses and peo-ple living with HIV, in comparison to other races and ethnicities. In my home of Houston, Texas, 6 out of every 10 diagnosed HIV infections are among African Americans. It is estimated that 1 in 90 Houstonians are living with HIV/AIDS. Racism, HIV stigma, homophobia, poverty, and barriers to health care exacerbate dispari-ties and pose obstacles that prevent people from proper testing and treatment that would reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS. I am proud to fight against racism, discrimi- nation, and other societal deformities that cause disparities in health status and keep people from seeking urgently needed health care. I have worked to declare HIV/AIDS a state of emergency among our African American community, which faces an infection rate near-ly eleven times that of white Americans. Internationally, I have worked to support PEPFAR in all they have done and continue to do to help those who struggle to combat the brutal HIV/AIDS virus. It is estimated that there are 38.4 million people worldwide living with HIV. In 2021, 1.5 million individuals acquired HIV, which is a 32 percent decline in new infections since 2010. This decline shows the impact that access to testing, treatment, care, and support services have on transmission and new diagnosis. In 2021, around 650,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses worldwide, compared to 2 million people in 2004 and 1.4 million in 2010. Through the work of the CDC, the NIH, and the UN's World Health Organization, we have made great strides in reducing the trans-mission of HIV through antiretroviral therapies (ART) that reduce detectable viral loads. Those who take ART as prescribed are often able to have undetectable viral loads, live long healthy lives, and not transmit HIV to partners through sex. In fiscal year 2021, PEPFAR provided HIV testing services for more than 50 million peo-ple and supported ART for nearly 19 million men, women and children globally. Because of PEPFAR, 2.8 million babies in 2021 were born HIV-free to parents living with HIV. But there is still much work to be done. The United Nations reports that progress on HIV treatment and prevention in the last three years has flatlined. As a leader in the global fight against HIV and AIDS, the United States must continue to support HIV/AIDS prevention, care, treatment, and research. My hope is that, through bipartisan support, Congress will continue to pass legislation that expands resources to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS both in the U.S. and globally. Beyond our borders, our efforts have ex- tended care to millions in the developing world, through increased resources for PEPFAR and the Global Fund. This collective progress reflects the heights that can be reached when all stakeholders work together to achieve common goals. I look forward to working with my col- leagues, federal agencies, foundations and philanthropists, the NGO sector, community partners, and other global leaders to put an end to this epidemic that continues to plague us. I want to thank everyone here today for sup- porting this extremely important issue. This is something that impacts us all and it should be a priority for all of us. And again, I want to thank NMAC for award- ing me with this year's John Lewis Good Trou-ble Award. I will do my best to continually earn this award by persistently supporting efforts to eradicate HIV/AIDS and advocating for minori-ties in Houston, the United States, and across the globe. May we all ''never, ever be afraid to make some noise and get in good trouble, nec-essary trouble''. f HONORING ART HAINS, THE VOICE OF THE MISSOURI STATE BEARS FOOTBALL TEAM HON. BILLY LONG OF MISSOURI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the long-time voice of the Missouri State Bears, Art Hains. Art grew up in Marshall, MO, working at the local radio station KMMO while still in high school. He went on to graduate from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX, studying broadcast journalism and working in the SMU sports information office from 1973 to 1976. After graduation he moved to Springfield, MO, working as the sports director and serving as the voice of the Southwest Missouri State Bears football and basketball teams for KGBX until 1981. He moved back to Dallas working for KRLD and hosting a daily sports show while also providing pre- and post-game cov-erage of the Dallas Cowboys. He also called SMU basketball games and was a studio host for the Southwest Conference Football Radio Network from 1982 to 1984. He returned to Springfield in 1985 and was again the voice of the Southwest Missouri State Bears football, basketball, and baseball teams as well as the coordinator of athletic promotions at Southwest Missouri State Uni-versity. He has continued to be the voice of the Bears ever since, even after the university changed its name to Missouri State University in 2005. He has hosted Sports Talk since 1995, originally on KWTO in Springfield before he switched to KBFL in 2020. In 2008, he started as the studio host for the Kansas City Chiefs and was a part of their 2020 Super Bowl win. He was inducted into the Springfield Area Sports Hall of Fame in 2003, and the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in 2017. Apart from his on-air work, Art has been ac- tive in the Springfield community. He is an or-dained elder at First and Calvary Presbyterian Church in Springfield, serves on the boards for Springfield Little Theater and the Springfield Area Sports Hall of Fame. He is also an active member of the Southeast Rotary Club and is a Paul Harris Fellow, the Free Masons and Shriners. He previously served on the board of the Dickerson Park Zoo in Springfield and still volunteers his time at Care Animal Shelter. Madam Speaker, since moving to Spring- field Art Hains has been actively involved in the local community and has been known for nearly four decades as the voice of the Mis-souri State Bears. His lifetime of work and service to the community is commendable. f IN MEMORY OF LUCIUS HOLLOWAY, SR. HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. OF GEORGIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-brance that I rise today to honor the life and legacy of a loving husband, dedicated father, distinguished Army Veteran, determined Civil Rights Advocate, faithful public servant, a be-nevolent man of God and my friend of long-standing, Deacon Lucius Holloway, Sr. Sadly, Deacon Holloway transitioned from labor to re-ward on Thursday, November 24, 2022. His life will be celebrated on Saturday, December 3, 2022, at Cooper Carver Elementary School in Dawson, Georgia. The remarkable journey of Deacon Lucius Holloway, Sr. began on April 1, 1932, as he was born to the union of Mr. Bobby Holloway, Sr. and Mrs. Mary Louise Thornton Holloway in Dawson, Georgia. VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:37 Dec Extensions of Remarks E1203 December 1, 2022 Deacon Holloway was educated in the Terrell County School System. He received his Auto Body and Frame Construction certifi-cation from the Albany Vocational Technical College in Albany, Georgia. He was married to his beloved wife and life partner, the late Emma Kate Holloway, for 60 years and they built a life of service and advo-cacy for humankind. Armed with a servant's heart, Deacon Hollo- way gave of himself to serve our country for three years of active duty in the United States Army during the Korean War. He retired as a Staff Sergeant after serving 22 years in the Army National Guard. His professional journey also took him to Delco Remy and Delphi, where he retired after 18 years of service. Deacon Holloway was a committed freedom fighter for the cause of justice and equality. He truly believed in the words that Dr. King penned from the Birmingham Jail: ''Injustice anywhere is threat to justice everywhere.'' Deacon Holloway was one of Terrell County's most influential Civil Rights activists, always speaking up for the voiceless and the hope-less. He was always concerned about African Americans exercising their rights as American citizens through the ballot box. Deacon Hollo-way engaged in many voter registration drives and mass meetings during his lifetime. His advocacy did not come without great cost to him and his family. Deacon Holloway had to endure many challenges during his Civil Rights advocacy, including having the gas line at his house cut during a cold day in the 1960s because he housed Freedom Rid-ers and members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee at his home. He was also arrested; he and his family were threat-ened, and a cross was burned in his front yard. But through all these indignities, he never wavered in his support for the cause of Civil and Human Rights. His relationship with the NAACP is long and storied. Deacon Holloway became the first Vice President of the Terrell County Branch in 1955. He served as Vice President for 65 years and President for one year. Deacon Holloway cemented his commitment by be-coming a lifetime member of the organization that he had given so much to for so long. Deacon Holloway was also a committed public servant. He served on the Terrell Coun-ty Board of Commissioners for 27 years, retir-ing in January of this year. Deacon Holloway was a tireless advocate for his constituents, constantly pushing to do the right thing for those that he represented. Most importantly, Deacon Holloway was a man of God who allowed Him to order his steps. He began his walk with Christ at an early age, first fellowshipping with the saints at County Line Missionary Baptist Church in Sas-ser, Georgia. In 1956, his Christian journey continued when he became a member of Sar-dis Missionary Baptist Church in Dawson, Georgia where he served faithfully in many ca-pacities, including as Ordained Deacon, Chair-man of the Deacon Board, Sunday School Su-perintendent, Youth Sunday School Teacher, Adult Sunday School Teacher and Vice Treas-urer of Finance. Anne Morrow Lindbergh once said that ''Only when a tree has fallen can you take the measure of it. It is the same with a man.'' A great tree has fallen, and we can all agree that we can take the measure of this great man for the great things he has done to uplift humanity. Deacon Lucius Holloway, Sr. achieved countless successes in his life. But none would have been possible with the grace of God and love and support of his dearly de-parted wife of 60 years, Emma Kate Holloway, his five children, one of whom preceded him in death, and his eleven grandchildren. On a personal note, Deacon Holloway was my friend. He always supported and encour-aged me with his wise counsel and sage ad-vice. He will be sorely missed, but the world is better because of him. Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House of Representatives join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the more than 730,000 people of the 2nd District in honoring and celebrating the life and legacy of Deacon Lucius Holloway, Sr. for his service to God, his country and humanity and in extending our deepest condolences to his family, friends and all who mourn his loss. May they be consoled and comforted by their faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks and months ahead. f HONORING MR. GEORGE HOLLAND, SR. HON. BARBARA LEE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary work of George Holland, Sr., and his indispensable contributions as an advocate in the fight for equal rights and racial justice, as the Presi-dent of the National Association for the Ad-vancement of Colored People in Oakland. Mr. Holland was born in Shreveport, Lou- isiana and raised in California, where he re-sided in segregated housing projects until his early adulthood, experiencing the impacts of institutional racism firsthand. In South San Francisco, Mr. Holland's family resided in the Lindenville Housing Project. The Lindenville Housing Project had a ''Colored Section,'' where he, his family, and 71 other Black fami-lies lived. Mr. Holland's experience living in segregated housing continued in 1955, when his family relocated to the Sunnydale Housing Project, which had only desegregated earlier that year. Mr. Holland was a trailblazer from a young age, he was the first member of his family to attend college, earning his Bachelor of Arts from San Francisco State College. He then earned his Juris Doctorate from the Golden Gate University School of Law. Mr. Holland went on to serve as a board member for sev-eral legal associations, including the Bar Asso-ciation of San Francisco and the Bar Associa-tion of Alameda County. Mr. Holland's legacy lies in his champion- ship of civil rights throughout his academic and professional career. As a young commu-nity activist, Mr. Holland participated in civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s throughout San Francisco, Oakland, and the greater Bay Area to advocate for racial equity. As an attor-ney, he contributed to the founding of the Cali-fornia Association of Black Lawyers, Califor-nia's first legal association dedicated to ad-dressing the needs and struggles of Black lawyers and to eradicating racism imbedded in our legal system. Since 2005, Mr. Holland has continued his service to our community as the President of the NAACP chapter in Oakland. Throughout his exemplary tenure as Presi- dent, Mr. Holland's efforts have distinguished the Oakland NAACP chapter for its engage-ment with the local community and for its lead-ership on national issues. Under his guidance, the organization collaborated with the Oakland Mayor and School Superintendent's ''Oakland Promise'' program, a community-based non- profit that aims to triple the number of college graduates from Oakland within the next dec-ade. Further, under Mr. Holland's leadership, the Oakland NAACP chapter partnered with the Chapel of Chimes to construct the Nelson Mandela Human Rights Memorial at Skylawn Memorial Park. Mr. Holland also oversaw the creation of a police commission in Oakland to improve police accountability and community trust in law enforcement. George has been a dear friend and loyal supporter. Whenever I needed help, he was there for me and our community. If ever, I needed anyone to watch my back\u2014there he was, generous and steady as always. For this, I am deeply grateful. On behalf of the 13th Congressional district, I would like to congratulate Mr. Holland on his incredible achievements throughout his career. He has been a wonderful activist, attorney, and a fierce advocate for racial justice and eq-uity for all people. I thank him for all his hard work, and congratulations again. I wish him the very best in his journey ahead. f RECOGNIZING THE 100TH BIRTH- DAY OF LILLIAN C. OVERTON HON. MIKE ROGERS OF ALABAMA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th birthday of Lillian C. Overton. Lillian was born October 29, 1922, to James Edwin and Esther Darnell Cooper in Franklin, Alabama. She was one of six children. On January 29, 1944, she was married to Herman A. Overton in Tuskegee, Alabama, and remained married until his death on April 9, 1996. They were blessed with one daugh-ter, Kathy O. Hadaway. Mrs. Overton was part owner and operator of M & L Jewelers in Tuskegee in the 1950s and early 1960s. After selling the jewelry store, she became account manager for Skinner's Furniture Store in Tuskegee until her retirement. She was a member of Tuskegee First Bap- tist Church for over 50 years. As an active member, she taught Sunday School, Training Union, Bible Drill and was active in the Wom-en's Missionary Union (WMU). After her husband's death, Mrs. Overton moved to Opelika, Alabama, and became an active member at First Baptist Church of Opelika (in Sunday School, WMU, and in the Nursery Department). Due to a brief illness in early 2022, she had to relinquish her duties at church. Prior to COVID, Mrs. Overton volunteered for 38 years at East Alabama Medical Center as a ''Pink Lady'' in Escort Services. This al-lowed her to meet numerous wonderful people and help others. She fulfills her most important job by telling others about Jesus, inviting them to church VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:37 Dec Extensions of Remarks E1204 December 1, 2022 and talking about her faith and the importance of knowing Jesus Christ. Madam Speaker, please join me in recog- nizing Lillian and wishing her a very happy 100th birthday. f REMEMBERING MR. JOHNNY SIMMONS HON. HALEY M. STEVENS OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, December 1, 2022 Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in memory of Mr. Johnny Simmons, a lifelong servant to others and longtime resi-dent of Oakland County, who passed away on August 29, 2022. As Mr. Simmons's family re-flected upon their loved one's life, they affec-tionately recall him as a faithful, loving, and kind person to all. While Mr. Simmons will be missed by the many who had the honor of knowing him, there is no doubt that these qualities have been impressed upon those around him and continue to positively influ-ence the community. On September 4, 1936, Mr. Johnny B. Sim- mons was born in Highlandal, Mississippi, to Albert Simmons and Annie Bell Dantzler and was raised by a ''village'' of Simmons that cared for him as he grew. Early in his life, Mr. Simmons moved from his small community of ''Sun-Side'' in Mississippi to the South Side of Chicago, Illinois. As Mr. Simmons was earning his high school education, racial discrimination plagued the City of Chicago. He attended an integrated grammar school before then attend-ing and graduating from the racially seg-regated DuSable High School. Following completion of his studies, Mr. Simmons served his country for four years with the United States Marine Corp and was honorably discharged in 1961. Shortly after his return to civilian life, Mr. Simmons married the love of his life, Charlene ''Chuck'' Simmons. Years later, he was quoted saying, ''My mem-ory of love will be of Chuck Simmons. I thank God for the many outstanding years we shared.'' Their commitment was lifelong, en-joying 61 years of marriage together. At the age of 26, Mr. Simmons was also united with his father in what was described as ''love at first sight,'' rounding out his young family. While in Illinois, Mr. Simmons, was inducted into the Chicago police force. 1968 was a time of significant social change as black Ameri-cans continued to experience devastating ra-cial discrimination throughout the country. Mr. Simmons witnessed the effects of this injustice as he performed his duties and was present for the unrest that resulted from the assas-sination of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968. After his time as an officer in Chicago, the family relocated to make Michigan their new home. Mr. Simmons became active in his new community, joining the Southside Seventh-day Adventist Church and maintained his service to the church for the remainder of his life. He proudly served as the patriarch of his beloved family in Pontiac, Michigan. Helping others and contributing to his community was a way of life for him, and many were fortunate to benefit from his selfless acts. Many are fortunate to carry on Mr. Sim- mons' wisdom, including his children, grand-children, and the many who respect Mr. Sim-mons' life serving others. Continuing this leg-acy are three outstanding children\u2014Jackie, Jon Eric, and Kelli Lyn. He also earned two ''bonus daughters'' with Jon Eric's marriage to his wife Michelle, welcoming her sisters, Paula and Candace, to the family and then gained an additional son with Kelli's marriage to Ladon. He will be truly missed by all. Mr. Simmons' friends and family bid him farewell at his funeral on Friday, September 9th, at the Troy Seventh-day Adventist Church, following visitation services on Sep-tember 8th. Mr. Simmons was given the great honor of receiving a military burial at the Great Lakes National Cemetery in Holly, Michigan, on September 12th, a fitting recognition to his years with the Marine Corps. Madam Speaker, it is a great honor to rec- ognize the life of Mr. Johnny Simmons today, and I ask my colleagues to join me in cele-brating his numerous contributions to our Na-tion. Mr. Simmons truly has lived a life worth celebrating and is owed a thanks for his life of service. f HONORING RICK ZIEGENFUSS, CITY ADMINISTRATOR OF HOL-LISTER, MO HON.
