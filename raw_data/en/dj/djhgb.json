I now feel confident and happy that I'm honouring mamma cacao in ceremony, from the time I make the cacao to when I close the ceremony - my main objective at the beginning of the course was blown out the water as I have left with so much more than I could have ever imagined including a beautiful book with all the information (so much information!) to refer back to. I absolutely recommend this course to anyone who feels called!\" LJ, Therapist, Healer and Mexican Cacao Farmer! \"I am in absolute bliss after the amazing 8 week online Cacao Spirit Medicine, cacaoista training. I can't find the words that come close enough to express the profound gratitude that I have for Sorrell for sharing her wisdom and welcoming me into her circle, to support her in her mission to spread the message that mama Cacao has for each one of us and begin a special unique relationship with her. With all the respect this wisdom has brought into my heart, I humbly say that I heard the call of the medicine of cacao and this training truly brought me closer to my Mexican roots, to the history of cacao and to the womb of Mother Earth. I am grateful for all the love and dedication of Sorrell in guiding us in the classes. I have been able to see, feel, and start a real, genuine, pure, and joyful relationship with cacao. If mama cacao is calling you, Sorrell is your teacher!\" An Amazing Course from a Talented and Passionate Teacher!
