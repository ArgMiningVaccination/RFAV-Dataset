Since the Coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic, it's not surprising to learn that during these times of great uncertainty, anxiety is at its highest and affecting individuals even more. For some, the symptoms are mild and manageable and for others, the anxiety is debilitating and having a huge impact on their lives. For those who already suffer from health anxiety, this virus can feel like a personal nightmare as they cope to manage their heightened fears. The good news is there are hundreds of possible homeopathic remedies that can help a person reduce their anxiety naturally. The most effective and rapid relief will come from a personalised prescription and selecting a remedy and potency that is most similar to your needs. Below is a brief outline of 6 top homeopathic remedies I use in my practice to help people stress less and relieve anxiety and panic attacks, quickly and naturally, where the symptom picture fits. * This is a useful remedy for acute panic attacks, intense anxiety or when fear overtakes rapidly without warning. There is a great sense of terror and fright with a fear that they might actually die. They are inconsolable. The person is restlessness and may experience palpitations, faintness, shortness of breath, flushing of the face or a throbbing headache. This is a highly excited and distressed state - not a calm one. It is intense - sudden - and acute. For people who are anxious or fearful due to uncertainty or anticipation. The \"What If\" remedy. What if this happens? What if I decide this? What if I make the wrong decision? This is anxiety or dread rather than sheer terror. Like the broken record, they keep replaying the same worrying thoughts over and over again. They are fearful not only about their personal health but also have problems with closed or open spaces, heights, flying or being trapped. They will seek out the exit route so they know they can escape easily. There is a great sense of dread, urgency and nervousness. This person is hurried, restless and impulsive. They speak quickly and everything they do or say is rushed. They also suffer from sleep deprivation, tossing and turning at night because of worry. The anxiety may be accompanied by trembling, dizziness, weakness, bloating, belching, palpitations or diarrhoea. There may be obsessive-compulsive behaviour. The anxiety is worse in the morning and before appointments or events. They crave sugary foods which make their digestive issues worse. They feel worse in hot stuffy rooms and get some relief in the fresh air. This remedy may be used for someone who is experiencing great anguish over their health and that of their family. The anxiety can overwhelm and dominate their life. They have a deep fear about dying and a profound fear of being alone. They are extremely despairing and fussy and worry about health matters, security and money. They need people around them and want constant reassurance that everything will be ok. To relieve their anxiety they can be controlling and critical particularly when unwell. They are fastidious and organised in their environment as feelings of security come from order. This can result in perfectionism, or the extreme compulsive behaviours and constant rechecking. Symptoms may include a painful gnawing in the pit of the stomach or sitting heavily on the chest. They are restless and fretting and pace the floor up and down. Pains are burning and are relieved from heat. Symptoms come on and are worse after midnight. They are chilly and thirsty for sips of water. Weakness and exhaustion are common symptoms too. The person needing Phosphorus is sensitive, nervous, excitable and full of intensive and vivid fears. They are an anxious person worrying about many things especially their health. They fear that something will happen, fear being alone at night in the darkness and this fear often continues into adulthood. They are open natured, affectionate and naturally kind, warm and considerate to others. As they tend to be overconcerned and sympathetic towards others, their energy can become easily diffused. In this stage, they become indifferent, \"spaced out\" or get ill because of \"sympathy exhaustion\". They have lots of friends and make friends easily. They feel better from conversation, company and are easily reassured. With physical ailments, they have a tendency towards respiratory tract conditions, coughs, bronchitis and colds that drop to the chest. The pain is described as a tightness or heaviness in the chest. With digestive upsets, they experience burning pains in the stomach and while thirsty for cold drinks, this is often vomited when unwell. They may suffer from recurrent nosebleeds and tend to faint and become weak when they don't eat. They crave ice-cream, salt, sweets and chocolate. In health, they are bubbly, energetic and vibrant. When ill they can appear low, apathetic, flat and indifferent - just like a glass of flat champagne! Those who need Calc Carb have many fears including a deep anxiety about their health and that of their families. They are terrible worriers, especially about the future, and they are overly concerned about catching infections and becoming ill. While strong-willed, they are very sensitive, cautious and often feel overwhelmed. Safety and routine are paramount and there is a craving for protection, security, and stability. They feel uncomfortable with change or new things and get security with routine and the familiar. Because of this, they can be insistent that plans go ahead as agreed, so they may appear stubborn or obstinate if changes are proposed. Being very responsible, they are methodical, determined, and hard-working. As an enthusiastic and diligent type of person, there is a tendency to take on too much which often leads to a state of overwhelm and exhaustion. This results in tremendous anxiety as they worry when things don't go according to plan or when tasks or left unfinished. They can describe the anxiety as a feeling that they are losing their mind or going insane. If it persists, it may eventually lead to a state of collapse on the physical or mental level. By nature, they are placid, easy-going and calm and have a shy contemplative nature. When upset they can withdraw as they fear embarrassing themselves. When ill they can become mildly depressed or introspective. Being a sensitive soul, they cannot bear to see cruelty or hear sad stories, as it affects them profoundly. They may have many other strong fears including fear of dogs, insects, spiders, mice and rats. There is also extreme fear of disaster, the darkness, death, having cancer or an incurable disease. Weak areas of their health include bones, joints, teeth, glands, skin, ear, nose, throat and a sluggish digestive system often accompanied with constipation. A great female hormonal remedy also, it is used to help with menstrual problems, menopausal symptoms, PMS and candida. For a person to benefit from the remedy Pulsatilla, anxiety tends to show itself as insecurity, with a need for reassurance and support to feel better. These are mild, gentle and affectionate people. They are easy-going, sensitive and have a soft demeanour. Being highly emotional, their moods can swing rapidly, without reason. One minute they are laughing or crying, and the next they are anxious and irritable. It can be hard to work out what they actually want! They dislike confrontation and will try to keep the peace. It is difficult for them to say no as they like to please others and the opinion of others affects them deeply. Becoming too warm or overheated can increase their anxiety and fresh air or gentle exercise will bring some welcomed relief. Stress and worry can keep them awake at night or cause anxious dreams. Hormonal fluctuations such as those experienced during puberty, menstruation or with the menopause, can heighten anxiety further. Most of their ailments, both physical and emotional are better in the fresh air, and worse at night. They respond well to receiving sympathy, support, and affection. They have many fears including abandonment, being alone, the darkness, being in a crowd or being overly concerned about what people think of them. Weak areas of their health include the stomach, veins, digestion, bladder and the female reproductive organs.
