[GET STARTED](https://infiniwell.com/collections/yunique-medical-iw) Suffering from injuries during an exercise can be a nightmare for professional athletes or those who wish to gain a better body shape through the workout. But, go with me on this: there will be no more of those days when you have to live with the pain. BPC-157 is a new healing method that has amazed the scientific community. Let's look at why it's so revolutionary and how you can use a daily BPC-157 dosage to heal your body faster. RELATED: [BPC-157 | A Potent Anti Inflammatory Peptide With Multiple Benefits](https://yuniquemedical.com/bpc-157-benefits/?utm_medium=Yunique&utm_source=link&utm_campaign=bpc-157-benefits) What Is BPC-157? Standing for Body Protecting Compound, BPC-157 is an entirely natural, healing-promoting [peptide](https://yuniquemedical.com/benefits-peptide-therapy/?utm_source=link&utm_medium=ym&utm_campaign=benefits-peptide-therapy) that delivers miraculous effects. When administered into the body, BPC-157 promotes the healing processes that aid your body's recovery, especially your connective tissues like tendons and ligaments. BPC-157 is composed of 15 amino acids isolated from human gastric juice. So yes, this pharmaceutical comes from our stomach! That's why BPC-157 is 100% natural and provides various consistent and well-tolerated benefits to the human body. BPC-157 only emerged as a new pharmaceutical a few years back but has already gained much attention from the scientific community and the fitness industry. So why is it so popular? And how has it become the focal point of popularity within such a short time? What Does BPC-157 Do? Tendon and ligament injury is one of the most common injuries in sports. In professional athletes, the constant, high-intensity physical activity causes tears in these connective tissues at a microscopic level. Aged people whose body has been weakened through time may also suffer from wear and tear. These injuries, in return, force people to live in distress. Unfortunately, the body's connective tissues are typically hypovascular, meaning that they are not connected with adequate numbers of blood vessels. This lack of blood supply results in a deficiency of blood, nutrients, and oxygen when an injury occurs. As a result, any damage to these body parts requires much time to recover fully. On this account, there is an urgent need for a peptide that accelerates the healing process. And here, the BPC-157 comes into play. According to a study by the [Journal of Applied Physiology](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00945.2010), BPC-157 has been shown to promote tendon healing. However, since the body contains more types of tissue than only the tendons, it is widely believed that this emerging peptide can benefit a broader range of organs, including the: - Ligament [Muscle](https://yuniquemedical.com/muscle-mass/?utm_source=link&utm_medium=ym&utm_campaign=muscle-mass) - Gastrointestinal tissues (stomach and intestines) - Skin - Cornea - Pancreas - Liver - Heart - Bone How Does BPC-157 Work? Understanding the Healing Process The healing process of any connective tissue consists of three consecutive stages: inflammation, regeneration, and remodeling. - Inflammation is when the body notices the damage and sends the inflammatory cells to the injured site, preparing for the regeneration process. - In the regeneration stage, the fibroblasts (the cells that build the fibers of the connective tissues) proliferate and produce collagens and glycoproteins to form the new tissues. - The final stage of healing - remodeling - begins weeks after the onset of the damage. The role of this stage is to regain the maximum strength of the once injured tissue. Regeneration is thought to be the most critical stage of the healing process since this is when the body gathers all the materials, like the fibroblasts and collagens, for the healing process. Nonetheless, as mentioned above, the hypovascular nature of the connective tissues makes it challenging to utilize the fundamental \"building blocks\" of the bloodstream. BPC-157 and Angiogenesis Due to its angiogenic effect (angiogenesis), BPC-157 can promote the formation of new blood vessels. Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels. Endothelial cells, which make up the inner lining of blood vessels and act as a barrier between the vessel wall and blood, move, proliferate, and differentiate during this process. So, the more blood vessels formed due to BPC-157, the more efficiently blood, nutrients, and oxygen are delivered to the injured sites, leading to quicker recovery. BPC-157 and Collagen Formation The [Journal of Applied Physiology](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00945.2010) study also mentions that BPC-157 may also control the function of collagen fragments. In case you're not familiar with this term, collagen fragmentation is the breakdown of collagen into smaller fragments. So we don't want our [collagens](https://yuniquemedical.com/benefits-of-collagen-for-men/) to fragment. Instead, we want it to be intact to maintain the structural integrity of the connective tissues. Although BPC-157's role in controlling collagen has yet to be proven experimentally, it is believed that this peptide is involved in the formation of collagen, or the defragmentation of collagen, which is vital to recovery since connective tissues contain collagen mostly. RELATED: [Peptide Therapy is the Next Thing in Optimization](https://yuniquemedical.com/peptide-therapy/?utm_medium=Yunique&utm_source=link&utm_campaign=peptide-therapy) Does BPC-157 Build Muscle? No. BPC-157 does not directly [build muscle](https://yuniquemedical.com/lose-fat-or-build-muscle/?utm_source=link&utm_medium=ym&utm_campaign=lose-fat-or-build-muscle). However, BPC-157 can aid in muscle recovery, which helps you shorten the interval between rehabilitation and the next workout. Two crucial factors that lead to muscle growth are muscle tension and muscle damage. During a training session, we all want to challenge ourselves and lift a heavier weight than we did the day before. Tackling a challenging yet achievable weight and adapting to the new, higher intensity is muscle tension. Everyone feels sore after a workout. That's called muscle damage. Straining our muscles to elevate hefty weight repeatedly tears the muscles at a microscopic level. The body then sends all the necessary materials to the damaged muscles. It then repairs and replaces them, leading to muscle growth. How Do You Take a BPC-157 Dosage? There are two main ways to use a BPC-157 dosage: injection and oral capsules. Depending on each individual's preference and expectation, BPC-157 can be taken either way while delivering relatively similar effects. If you're uncomfortable with needles, go for the capsules. However, keep in mind that you may not absorb 100% of the BPC-157 dosage due to digestion and metabolism. Injecting a BPC-157 dosage is a little more efficient and faster-acting. Professional athletes supposedly prefer this route of administration since injecting BPC-157 into the bloodstream and muscles can directly benefit the target injured site. That said, both injections and capsules provide systemic effects of a BPC-157 dosage. Check out the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2auWI6jcg) below to learn more about how to inject a BPC-157 dosage. BPC-157 Injection Benefits The superiority of BPC-157 injections over capsules is that it provides instant, local effects on the injection site. The [Journal of Applied Physiology](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00945.2010) shows that a BPC-157 dosage is highly stable, easily dissolved in water, and doesn't need a carrier for its application. Moreover, BPC-157 usually shows apparent beneficial effects after one application, while long-lasting activity has also been recorded. What Is the Right BPC-157 Dosage? Basic dosage: [2.5-3.75 micrograms/kilogram Injections: 16 syringe units/time/twice a day (injected BPC-157 must be diluted with bacteriostatic water). Please follow the instructions on the vial. - Oral capsules: maximum 500 micrograms (0.5 milligrams)/day/2 times a day. You should take BPC-157 consistently daily for up to 3 months, then give it a break for one month. BPC-157 is a prescription pharmaceutical in some states, so consult your doctor to decide if you're qualified for drug use. Below is the BPC-157 single dosage based on How Long Does a BPC-157 Dosage Take to Work? After about a week, you should start seeing some results. However, many reported that pain relief began less than a week after taking this medication. Factors like dosage or the severity of the wound might influence how quickly effects become apparent. Some people see results right away, but for the most part, the advantages build over time. Does BPC-157 Have Any Side Effects? Until now, research on BPC-157 is limited, and records for its side effects are not substantial. Considering the short half-life nature of peptides, of which BPC-157 is an example, it can initially be that the agent is generally safe. Unlike hormones that stay in the body for a long time, peptides bind to the receptor of cells, cause a chemical reaction, then go away. However, it is better not to overlook any possible side effects. If you take BPC-157 via an injection, you may get: - Itchiness, pain, or numbness at the injection site - Vein, muscle, or skin discomfort - Higher blood pressure - Increased water retention - Unintentional weight gain/loss - Tiredness Who Can Benefit From BPC-157? - Professional athletes or regular people with post-workout injuries - Aged people with wear and tear damage to the tendon, ligament, muscle, and bone - Patients with gastrointestinal diseases, like gastric ulcers, leaky gut, irritable bowel syndrome, and Crohn's disease More applications for BPC-157 are under investigation. Until then, we can safely and effectively use BPC-157 to aid in the recovery of various injuries.
