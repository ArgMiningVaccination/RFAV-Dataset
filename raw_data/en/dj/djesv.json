A quantitative assessment of gland weight and acinar area, and detailed [serum] analyses, were also performed.</p><p><b>RESULTS</b> [Parotid gland] [weights] were significantly decreased in the 15 and 20 Gy groups at 4 and 16 weeks post-IR. The [acinar cell] area in glands of both IR groups was significantly reduced. Parotid flow rates decreased by 60% with 15 Gy at 16 weeks post-IR. In the 20 Gy group, salivary flow rates were reduced by 80% at 16 weeks post-IR. Additionally, parotid flow rates significantly reduced in contralateral glands with 20 Gy at 16 weeks, while structure and weight did not changes in [parotid glands] .</p><p><b>CONCLUSION</b>Structural changes in [salivary gland] parenchyma occurred relatively early after IR, while the alterations in salivary output were relatively delayed. Further, reductions in salivary flow were not proportional to [acinar cell] area loss. There isn't a significant structured change of contralateral glands, but significant reduction of parotid flow "}
