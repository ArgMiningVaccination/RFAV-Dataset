It has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization as of March 12, 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which caused millions of people to be infected and killed many people worldwide, is a severe public health problem. The average incubation period is 4-5 days (0-14 days). The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, joint pains, headache, and shortness of breath. The disease can show severe and mortal effects in people with advanced age and different treatments. The disease diagnosis is made by molecular analysis of respiratory samples of suspected cases using special primers. In addition to supportive vitamin and protein support in treatment, specific vaccines are produced, the number of which increases day by day. The absence of close contact, such as handshaking and hugging, and the isolation of possible patients are among the most effective methods to prevent the disease's spread. In addition to personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves, continuous cleaning is essential in the fight against the epidemic. This study looks at the COVID-19 pandemic from a general perspective, especially with the current advances in vaccines, and evaluates the past pandemic processes worldwide. It is to make inferences by considering the impact of COVID-19 on the world and Turkey. |Primary = = volume number pages = {281 - 291}, title = {Past to Present, Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Ways of Treatment: A Review}, key = (2022).
