One issue that we are all surely aware of, and therefore warrants greater understanding is the detoxing industry. This includes ready-made detoxification beverages, natural detoxes and many more techniques besides. Here we will let you in on the 5 most common misconceptions surrounding the detox industry. Fact: There are many detox techniques that emphasize the body's excretion of waste products, with a particular focus on our bowel movements, which can leave us feeling lighter. However, the truth is that we only pass fecal matter and liquids during bowel movements, meaning that no fat is burned at all in the process. Moreover, in some cases, the increase in bowel movements may even lead to a loss of essential vitamins and minerals. Fact: There are no shortcuts to good health, and detoxifying the body is no different. Before buying supplements or detoxifying drinks at markets or online, you should be sure to study them fully, checking the ingredients as well as whether they have been approved by the FDA. It is best not to buy any products for your own personal consumption before you've consulted a qualified pharmacist or physician. Fact: Fermented drinks using fruits and vegetables as an ingredient cannot help with detoxifying. Instead, it can pose a health risk in cases where those ingredients have not been properly cleaned before use. This is especially the case in self-styled homemade products which do not meet basic health and safety standards as these could become contaminated during the fermenting process. Both the type of container and the raw ingredients used have the potential to increase the contamination risk in terms of dangerous diseases or bacterial infections that can result in diarrhea, as well as negative long-term effects on the digestive system. Fact: Laxatives work by helping the body to draw out liquids from the intestinal walls, making the fecal matter softer and easier to pass. Laxatives are not capable of flushing our waste products or descaling intestinal walls. In addition, frequent use of laxatives may have effect on your health so if you are suffering from symptoms associated with constipation, it is best to consult your doctor. Fact: Buying detox equipments and tending to your intestinal health on your own at home is not recommended because it may increase the risk of contracting diseases or infections, and be dangerous in cases where mistakes are made during the detox process. Our bodies naturally process waste products by filtering them out in the kidneys and liver, thus making detoxification of the intestines an unnecessary process. Nevertheless, if food is consumed which contains toxins, the body will absorb these, alongside the other vitamins and minerals, in the small intestines. Then, whatever cannot be digested or absorbed then becomes stored as fiber in the large intestines. However, if you are afraid that your body is becoming contaminated with toxins, you should start by paying care and attention to your diet. Do this by eating a healthy, balanced diet, low in fat and foods which could contain toxins harmful to the body. Avoid eating ready-made meals, chargrilled foods and deep fried products, especially those fried in oils that may have been used more than once. articles "}
