Chanterelles are also grown in other parts of the world, including North America. They have a fruity, apricot-like odor. Also called \"girole\" or \"girolle\" in France, these mushrooms are often added to pasta and other savory dishes. Chanterelles and other types of mushrooms have a meaty texture that can provide heartiness to meat-free dishes. Like most mushrooms, chanterelles are very low in calories and provide fiber and other nutrients such as vitamin D and copper. Chanterelle Mushroom Nutrition Facts The following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for 1 cup (54g) of provide 17 calories in a full cup serving. The total carb count is only 3.7 grams. Two grams of carbohydrate comes from beneficial fiber. The glycemic index of chanterelles (specifically) is not known. But the glycemic load of a one-cup serving of raw mushrooms (variety unspecified) is estimated to be 2, making them a low glycemic food. Glycemic load takes portion size into account when estimating a food's impact on blood glucose. Fats There is almost no fat in chanterelle mushrooms. A single serving provides just 0.3 grams. However, if you cook them in oil or butter your fat intake will increase. Protein Chanterelle mushrooms contain a small amount of protein, just 0.8 grams per one-cup serving. However, even though they're not a substantial source of this macronutrient, they do provide all of the essential amino acids. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein. Your body doesn't make all of them, so some of them (called essential amino acids) must be consumed in food. A Complete Guide to Amino Acids Vitamins and Minerals Chanterelle mushrooms are a good source of vitamins. A one-cup serving of raw chanterelles provides 0.1mg riboflavin, which is of niacin (about 15% RDI); and 2.9mcg vitamin D (about 14% RDI). Chanterelle mushrooms are an excellent source of copper (0.2mg, or 21% RDI, per cup). This essential mineral helps your body maintain a healthy nervous system and immune function. Copper is also important for brain development. Chanterelle mushrooms also contain a good amount of non-heme iron, 1.9mg per 1 cup serving. This equates to 10% of the recommended daily intake. Calories Chanterelle mushrooms contain 17.3 calories in a 1 cup (54g) serving. Of those calories, 71% come from carbs, 16% from protein, and 13% from fat. Chanterelles are a low-calorie food in terms of volume compared to caloric density. Summary Chanterelle mushrooms are a nutrient-dense, low-calorie food that provides several important vitamins and minerals, often rare in plant sources. These include copper, iron, and vitamin D. They are also a good source of fiber. Health Benefits Different types of mushrooms and mushroom extracts have been used as natural remedies for hundreds of years by Greeks, Romans, and in traditional Chinese medicine. Research investigating the benefits of mushrooms in general and chanterelles specifically has found evidence to support health claims. Improves Immune Function Mushrooms such as chanterelles are known to contain flavonoids including myricetin and catechin. They are also known to contain phenolic acids that have valuable immune-boosting properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticarcinogenic properties. Some preliminary research suggests that mushrooms may support healthy immune function through interaction with the gut microbiota, enhancing the development of adaptive immunity and improved immune cell functionality. How Flavonoids Benefit Your Health Supports Heart Health The fiber in mushrooms is useful for cholesterol reduction. In addition, mushrooms are known to contain ergosterol, a type of sterol that has antioxidant properties and is important in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Since mushrooms are naturally low in sodium and almost entirely fat-free, mushrooms can be a heart-healthy food, especially when consumed instead of fatty meats. Reduces Risk of Prostate Cancer A study published in a 2020 issue of the International Journal of Cancer found that men who consume mushrooms more often have a reduced risk of prostate cancer. Researchers followed 36,499 Japanese men, aged 40 to 79 years. Those who consumed mushrooms more than three times per week had the lowest risk, whereas those who consumed mushrooms less than one time per week had the highest risk. Researchers attribute the relationship to ergothioneine, an antioxidant commonly found in mushrooms. Lowers Risk of Infectious Disease Chanterelle mushrooms can be an excellent source of vitamin D. This important nutrient plays several important roles in the body, including helping the immune system to fight off invading bacteria and viruses. Researchers are currently investigating the relationship between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. While much more research needs to be done, there is some speculation that getting more vitamin D may help reduce the severity of the disease, especially in older people. Can a Vitamin D Supplement Prevent COVID-19? Supports Bone Health Another important role that vitamin D plays in the body is to help build strong bones. This nutrient is needed to absorb calcium and maintain bone health. People who get too little vitamin D may develop soft, thin, and brittle bones. Many people meet their vitamin D needs by spending time in the sun. But you can also boost your vitamin D levels by eating foods like mushrooms. In fact, there are some mushrooms that have higher levels of vitamin D as a result of increased exposure to ultraviolet light. Allergies Reports of mushroom allergy are rare. But it is not impossible to have a reaction to certain varieties. For example, there is a report of a patient who developed a red rash and systemic anaphylactic shock immediately after ingesting button mushrooms. There is some concern that those with mold allergies may have a reaction after exposure to mushrooms. If you suspect that you may be allergic to chanterelles or any variety of mushroom, speak to your healthcare provider to get personalized advice. Adverse Effects It is not likely that you will experience adverse effects after consuming chanterelle mushrooms in amounts commonly consumed as food. However, there are many mushroom extracts and supplements that might contain ingredients other than mushrooms. It's important to keep in mind that supplements are largely unregulated and not tested for safety. Use caution and speak to your healthcare provider before taking supplements. Varieties There are many different species of chanterelle mushrooms, with some more common in North America and others more common in Europe. The golden chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius) is the most common. Chanterelle mushrooms and other mushroom varieties can be found in most grocery stores. You're likely to find them in the fresh produce section, although chanterelle mushrooms can also be sold in dried form. When It's Best Chanterelles are often found from summer through late December. But in some areas, the season may extend from July through February. Many people hunt for the mushrooms in forested areas throughout the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere in the U.S. Like many other mushrooms, chanterelles grow near hardwood trees like maple, poplar, and oak trees. If you do your own mushroom hunting, it's important to use a reliable guide to make sure that the mushrooms you harvest are safe to consume. Another similar mushroom variety, called the Jack O' Lantern mushroom, is toxic to humans (although not lethal). When choosing fresh mushrooms at your local market, look for those that are flexible but firm and supple. Chanterelles are usually funnel-shaped and can be as big as 5 inches in diameter (they are usually much smaller). Avoid mushrooms that have signs of slime or mold. Storage and Food Safety If you buy fresh chanterelles that are pre-packaged, remove any plastic wrap as soon as you bring them home. Store the mushrooms in a breathable paper bag. Place them in a dark, cool environment\u2014the refrigerator is best. Chanterelles may last up to a week if properly stored, but it's best to consume them within 3 to 5 days. Immediately before use, clean your mushrooms with a mushroom brush or a damp paper towel. Avoid rinsing them in water, as it can affect the taste. Use a paring knife to trim the stems if you choose. Chanterelle mushrooms can also be frozen, but it is best to cook them first. Soak them for about 5 minutes, then steam for up to 3 minutes. Place the mushrooms in an airtight container or flash-freeze them so that they don't stick together. Chanterelles and other mushrooms can also be dried in a low heat oven. Place them on a clean baking sheet lined with parchment and place in a 200-degree oven with an open door. It may take up to an hour for the mushrooms to dry out fully. You can also use a food dehydrator. Once the dried mushrooms are room temperature, store them in a cool dark place. When you are ready to use them reconstitute by soaking in water for 20 minutes. How to Prepare Chanterelle mushrooms pair well with fish, steak, poultry, game, and savory vegetables. The simplest way to prepare them is simply to saut\u00e9 them in a hot pan with a small amount of olive oil or white wine. Sprinkle the mushrooms with salt and pepper (or your favorite herb) and eat them as a side dish, top your burger with them, or toss them into pasta. 11 Sources Verywell Fit uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
