Massage is a great way to relieve the underlying muscle tension. Pranamat ECO triggers a release of powerful pain-blocking endorphins. 2Clear Head 80% of study participants reported disappearance or significant alleviation of headaches Tension in the neck muscles cause blood vessels to narrow, which is one of the most common causes of headaches. The nerve cells in the brain do not get enough oxygen, causing pain attacks that can last from a few hours to several days. 3Energy Boost 100% of clients noticed a reduction of fatigue and low energy A period of stress, an infection or loss can trigger fatigue in many of us. Clinical studies prove that Pranamat ECO Massage can improve overall wellness and help to restore energy levels. This offers the freedom to live, work and love as you deserve. Everyone agrees it's a fantastic fatigue fighter! 4Sound Sleep 95% of people say that massage at bedtime helped them fall asleep faster, and wake fewer times during the night Sleep is the cradle of wellness. Pranamat ECO induces natural, restful sleep. It encourages your body to suppress cortisol and release endorphins. Cortisol is the stress neurotransmitter associated with wakefulness. 5Sunny Mood 90% of study participants observed feeling significantly happier when using Pranamat ECO for thirty days Low mood can be the result of stress, poor lifestyle, underlying illness, a change of seasons or simple human sadness. By activating the \"happiness\" neurochemistry in the brain, Pranamat ECO Massage has been proven to lift mood. 6Strong Mind 90% of study participants felt calmer and more resistant to stress with their daily massage Stress is the body-mind reaction to external stimulus, such as work pressure or family problems. Anxiety is an internalised baseline of fear or worry. Pranamat ECO Massage has an immediate calming effect that you can feel in your body. 7Supple Muscles 97% observed total muscle relaxation, improved posture, and a stronger-feeling spine Pranamat ECO Massage improves blood flow to the area of massage. This blast of warmth, oxygen and nutrients deeply relaxes the muscle tissue. Twenty minutes is all it takes to relieve a stiff neck, aching shoulders or knotted back. 8Light Legs 97% of people say that regular massage improves circulation, breaking the numbness-pain cycle Leg pain has many causes. It can be the result of rigorous exercise, poor circulation, trapped or inflamed nerves, or a symptom of the immobility associated with other conditions. Whatever the cause, it has a serious impact on quality of waking life. 9Toned Skin 90% agree that the appearance of cellulite is reduced over time The skin loses its tone over time due to poor blood flow. Thighs and butts hold a protective layer of fat that inhibits blood flow, causing cellulite. Pranamat ECO Massage draws blood to the skin, which leaves it looking smoother and more toned. 0reason_0_title reason_0_prc reason_0_desc reason_0_text Feel the results in seconds Lie down and feel the difference A pleasant tingling runs through your body Blood circulation is activated Soothing heat spreads through your body Cell regeneration is kick-started A powerful flood of endorphins block pain Deep relief from muscle tension Euphoric calm in body and mind - 30 seconds - 1 MIN - 2 min - 3 min - 5 min - 10 min - 20 min Handpicked for you [Full Body Original Massage Set](/eshop/massage-set-mat-pillow-and-mini/black-edition) [](/eshop/massage-set-mat-pillow-and-mini/black-edition) Mat + Pillow + Mini \u20ac350 \u20ac350 Add to cart [Basic Massage Set](/eshop/massage-set-mat-and-pillow/orange) [](/eshop/massage-set-mat-and-pillow/orange) Mat + Pillow \u20ac235 \u20ac235 Add to cart High quality standards High quality standards This high-performance massage element, in the form of the lotus, has a unique shape that deeply stimulates the skin without hurting it.
