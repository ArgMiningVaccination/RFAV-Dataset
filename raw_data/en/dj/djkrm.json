As a powerhouse antioxidant, Quercetin Phytosome benefits an optimized immune response, offers support for allergy sufferers, and promotes a healthy aging process for well-rounded daily wellness support. Key Ingredient: About Quercetin Phytosome An antioxidant flavonoid that supports balanced immune function, inflammatory response, and histamine release* Quercetin is a flavonoid found in many plant-based foods - onions having the highest amount. Other fruits and vegetables that contain significant amounts of quercetin include apples, berries, grapes, and green leafy vegetables. As ubiquitous as quercetin is in nature, it also has wide-ranging benefits in the body. One important actions is to strengthen mast cell membranes (a type of white blood cell), which down-regulates the release of histamine, providing nutritional support for skin sensitivity (like hives) and seasonal allergies.* Quercetin also has important antioxidant activities and supports balanced immune function and inflammatory response - all of which provide benefit for respiratory health, athletic performance, healthy aging, and more.* New research is emerging that supports quercetin's role in healthy aging.* Quercetin is the first natural substance to be identified as a senolytic - a substance that clears worn out, dysfunctional cells (senescent cells) from the body.*Senescent cells have been identified as a major contributor to the aging process. The Thorne DifferenceIn its unbound form, quercetin is known for its poor absorption. The crucial advantage attributable to quercetin phytosome is that it's made using advanced phytosome technology. Phytosome complexes are created by a patented process that binds a botanical constituent (in this case quercetin) to phospholipids that are key components of cell membranes. In the case of quercetin phytosome, the quercetin is combined with sunflower-sourced phospholipids, thus creating a phytosome complex that can easily cross the gut barrier. A recent study found up to 20-times greater blood levels of quercetin following ingestion of quercetin phytosome compared to unbound quercetin.
