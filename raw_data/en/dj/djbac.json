Only later, and with some effort, did I remind myself that I jog as much as current medical opinion says is needed to keep my heart and lungs fit. Dr. Harvey Simon of the Harvard Cardiovascular Health Center, for one, recommends 20 to 30 minutes of aerobic exercise three times a week, at 75 percent of maximal pulse rate for one's age. So more jogging than I'm doing might not be better for me, but worse. For exceeding recommended amounts of almost all prescribed health practices, from the rigorous to the most innocuous exercise programs and beneficial diets, poses definite health risks. Indeed, the present American mania for strenuous exercise and megadose vitamin therapies is making many people needlessly sick; they could spare themselves misery (and save money and time) by thinking not that more is better but that more is worse. Running within prescribed limits, for instance, has definite benefits, but long cross-country competitive racing, marathons, and even jogging well in excess of the recommended amount can clearly be dangerous. Two of the risks of overjogging: Hyperthermia (prolonged elevated body temperature): This, according to the American College of Sports Medicine, ''is the most common serious problem encountered in North American fun runs and races.'' It can cause heat shock, with collapse and unconsciousness (usually transient), or heat stroke, which, unless treated promptly and effectively, results in convulsions and permanent brain damage or death. Injuries, particularly of the knee or foot: Some 50 percent to 70 percent of runners suffer them, according to medical reports. The more running, the more injuries. One survey of a large group of runners found that only a fifth of those who ran less than nine miles a week developed musculoskeletal problems, as compared to half of those who ran 30 miles a week. Other prolonged, physically strenuous activities can cause less conspicuous but no less important damage - to the blood, for example, resulting in what the medical profession now calls sports anemia. The symptoms include weakness, fatigue, irritability and, in adolescent girls, stunted growth. One recent study found that 4 out of 10 teen-age female joggers had iron deficiency. Females, because they lose blood through the menses, are particularly prone to sports anemia; 44 percent of ballerinas had athletic amenorrhea, irregular menses or none at all. The condition is most common in women who train most intensively, and it is not a minor problem. The lack of menses is the result of low estrogen output, due to excessive exercise, which can cause osteoporosis long before menopause. Why it is that strenuous exercise causes sports anemia isn't clear, but what does seem clear is, again, that more is worse. One theory is that red blood cells are simply pounded to death; another is that such overactivity creates microscopic breaks in the intestine and bladder - which are hurled around like unsecured cargo in a storm-tossed ship - and that blood seeps out through these temporary apertures. The slothful or inactive may take these untoward effects to justify avoiding all exercise and indulging, whenever possible, in total inactivity. Obese people, harried mothers of small children, and overworked executives often say that what they'd like most would be a few days in bed - sleeping and reading. It may be that, as an Italian proverb has it, ''Bed is a medicine,'' but beyond reasonable doses this medicine, too, can be dangerous to one's health. Bed rest is essential for patients with certain cardiac, pulmonary and musculoskeletal disorders, but hundreds of studies have documented its adverse effects on the metabolism and on vital functions. Thorough rest in bed has much the same effect on healthy people. Volunteers, after only two or three days of bed rest, begin to lose calcium through the urine, the rate of loss increasing sharply with time; the long-term results are erosion of the skeleton and the formation of urinary stones. Cardiac output decreases, studies have shown, by 16 percent after 10 days of bed rest and by 26 percent after three weeks. According to one report, presented in 1982 at the National Conference on Fitness and Aging, three weeks of bed rest results in a functional decline equal to 30 years of aging. All of which suggests that the person who frequently spends the weekend resting in bed probably functions during the week like a person some years older. The more-is-better fallacy is particularly common and harmful when it comes to diet supplements. One form this takes is the ''megadose therapy'' of vitamins, which, says the Harvard Medical School Health Letter, has recently become a growth industry. Many ''orthomolecular'' doctors, ''healthologists,'' certain nutritionists, and health-food faddists have touted megadoses of vitamin B6 for premenstrual symptoms, vitamin A for allergies, diabetes, eczema and heart disease, vitamin E for a wide variety of disorders. Then, of course, there are the claims of Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling that huge doses of vitamin C can prevent or cure colds and prolong the lives of cancer victims. Megadose therapies reported in the medical literature range from 10 times to several thousand times the recommended daily allowances specified by the Food and Drug Administration. For a few conditions, such doses are beneficial; a case in point is the treatment of pernicious anemia by megadoses of vitamin B12. But megadose therapy isn't something to play around with or undertake on the advice of faddists; the medical literature abounds in cautionary tales. The New England Journal of Medicine reports that seven patients, taking up to 3,000 times the recommended daily allowances of vitamin B6 for premenstrual edema and other conditions, developed unsteadiness when walking, clumsiness handling objects, and loss of sensation in the hands and feet, due to the degeneration of sensory nerve fibers. Some other common examples of hypervitaminosis: * Vitamin A: hair loss, skin rashes, chronic liver disease. * Vitamin B3: peptic ulcer, arrhythmias, low blood pressure. * Vitamin D: anorexia, vomiting, weakness, impaired kidney function. * Vitamin E: headache, blurred vision, gastrointestinal disturbances, reduced resistance to infection. Even megadoses of vitamin C, which is rapidly excreted by the kidneys - the only side effect, it is said, is high-priced urine - are not wholly innocuous. In some people, vitamin megadoses cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and leg swelling, and may increase the risk of the formation of kidney stones. (The level at which megadoses are harmful varies with each vitamin; details are spelled out in such readily available reference works as the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy.) EVEN FIBER IN THE DIET, WHICH IS CURRENTLY so highly praised because of the reduction in the chance of bowel cancer - by promoting swifter passsage of the feces - can be harmful in excess, because some kinds of fiber interfere with the absorption of needed minerals. And outlandish as it may seem, a high-fiber diet may be risky to life itself: Franz Ingelfinger, the late editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, once reported that Andean Indians of Peru, who eat a very high-fiber diet, develop long and convoluted sigmoid colons and, as a result, frequently suffer fatal obstructions because of the knotting of that organ. The National Cancer Institute says the average American consumes 11 grams of fiber a day, recommends 20 to 30 grams - and advises that no more than 35 a day be eaten. Well, at least one thing taken in large quantities - pure water, drunk when running long distances or to cleanse the system - can't hurt, can it? It can. A 1985 report in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise presents the cases of four runners who drank too much during endurance races, and who developed hyponatremia, or ''water intoxication.'' All had to be hospitalized after they lost consciousness, and two had grand mal seizures. Even people who simply drink large amounts of water to purify the body have been known to suffer lethargy, confusion, stupor and coma, the consequences of electrolyte imbalance - overdilution of essential chemicals dissolved in body fluids - and of body fluids and the wash-out of sodium. How curious that we need to relearn, again and again, a lesson the ancient Greeks taught: the value of the Golden Mean, of moderation in all things. Yet it was the Father of Medicine himself, Hippocrates, who, though he never heard of hyponatremia or hypervitaminosis, much less athletic amenorrhea, said, ''Everything in excess is opposed to nature.''
