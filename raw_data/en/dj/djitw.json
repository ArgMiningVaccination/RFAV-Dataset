DR. JAMES L ANDREWS I entered in to the Chiropractic profession with a deep sense of compassion for those struggling with various health issues that in many cases allopathic medicine seemingly could not address. I am intent on really listening to my patients as I believe that is the most important aspect of a good examination. I am dedicated to treat each patient with respect and attentiveness focusing on each one as a complete person. I look forward to providing excellent care for my patients. I have been in family practice for nearly 20 years. I have patients of all ages from new born to the very elderly. My very gentle instrument adjusting technique is well tolerated by all and very effective even in the most difficult cases. I utilize both Neuromechanical Innovations Impulse IQ and Activator Method Chiropractic Techniques. I am committed to keeping up with the most current research in the Chiropractic profession. I have been married to Janine for over 34 years and I have 3 grown children and 3 grandchildren. I like to go camping, hiking, hunting and fishing with my kids and grand kids (when available) in the great northwest. I also like to go skiing on occasion. I am active with my church family and am involved with Campus Ministries at one of the local universities. DR. MARK R. JOHANSEN Dr. Mark is a gregarious, adventurous, and passionate individual. His pursuit of science prompted his studies in chemistry and human biology. After finishing university in 2008 he volunteered for 6 months administering tropical medicine in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. During this volunteering he came to have an understanding of healthcare and had the privilege to help many people. These experiences in healing created a desire to practice holistic medicine. He returned to the states to study chiropractic and he graduated with his doctorate in 2012. In practice he works to combine the latest research and developments in medicine with time-proven healing methods. He enjoys being a multi-talented and effective doctor and providing excellent relief and recovery for his patients. Dr. Mark and his bride Allison live in Historic Milwaukie with their dog Abe.
