The information provided on these pages should not be taken as individual medical advice. Your medical team (neurologist, MS nurse, GP) is still your primary source of contact for any concerns or specific questions you may have about COVID-19, vaccinations and timing of MS treatments and other medicines. For general queries about MS, please contact [your state or territory MS Member Organisation](https://www.msaustralia.org.au/support-services), or the Coronavirus Hotline on [1800 675 398](tel:1800675398). If you test positive for COVID-19 please contact your medical team for further advice. New advice for COVID-19 vaccine boosters has been issued by ATAGI on the 1 September 2023.

To access the latest information, please click [here](https://www.msif.org/news/2020/02/10/the-coronavirus-and-ms-what-you-need-to-know/). As the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination roll-out remain global health priorities, collecting, sharing and analysing data from all around the world is more important than ever. This data sharing initiative means we will gain faster and more accurate insights into COVID-19 and MS, to help people with MS and their healthcare teams make evidence-based decisions on how to manage their condition during the pandemic, how to manage the illness if they develop a COVID-19 infection and how to manage the COVID-19 vaccination process. For more information about how the MS global data sharing initiative works, and how the data is used, please click [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wj1oo9o8weh2v2y/MS%20Data%20sharing%20initiative%20-%20MS%20organisation%20overview.pdf?dl=0). The unique aspects of MS and specific medications make it difficult to give broad and general advice. If you still have questions that are not answered in these resources, please contact your neurologist, MS healthcare team or your GP. Together we can build on the extensive information we already have gained through the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to help people and families living with MS to live their best lives possible as we navigate this new world.
