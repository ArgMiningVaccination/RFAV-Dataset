Doing \"nothing\" appears like good medicine UBC SBM History of Homeopathy Invented by Samuel Hahnemann in 1796 - Germany Was bothered by current explanation for how cinchona bark cured malaria. - \"Strengthens the stomach\" - In fact contains Quinine kills malaria parasite UBC SBM History of Homeopathy Decided to dose himself with cinchona - Palpitations - Anxiety - Trembling - NO fever (malaria causes very high fevers) Concluded first tenant: \"like cures like\" - If two diseases with \"similar\" symptoms affect patient, the \"stronger\" disease cures \"weaker\" - Only experiment behind \"like cures like\" UBC SBM History of - Serial dilutions and succussions (shakings) - Believed made remedy more potent Not a single molecule remained UBC SBM History of Homeopathy \"Provings\" - Healthy subjects given preparation - EVERY sensation, feeling, mood change, and physical change over days to months caused by preparation No matter how trivial or vague Example: \"dreams which are not remembered\" or \"tickling sensation on the palm which obliges a person to scratch\" UBC SBM History of Homeopathy Materia Medica - Textbook of provings - 1300 recorded - Half before 19th century - 65 from Hahnemann Randomized controlled trials: - \"provers\" not able to distinguish between homeopathic preparation and placebo UBC SBM Modern Homeopathy Same core tenants - Homeopathic vaccines Opposition to immunizations - \"Nosodes\" Potentized diseased animal parts UBC SBM Homeopathic Logic Example: A drug that wakes you up? Does decaf coffee put you to sleep? ... Lets look at dilutions - More SBM Dilute! Dilutions Exactly how dilute does homeopathy go? Listed as multiples of \"C\". - C is diluted 100 times. - 2C is 100 x 100 = 10 000 times diluted. - Up to 200C ... The \"most potent\" homeopathic dose is a dilution of 12C homeopathic remedy would you need to get just 1 molecule of caffeine? - The ENTIRE Atlantic Ocean!!! - How many molecules are you getting in a pill? Zilch. Nada. Zero. UBC SBM How do Vaccines Work? Vaccines can be made several different ways: weakening the bug, killing it, using only some of its proteins, etc What all of these methods do is allow your body to recognize part of the bug so that you can strengthen your immune system UBC SBM Homeopathic Vaccines Has no molecule of the bug! Your body cannot build an immune response Homeopathic vaccines have been shown to not be effective to stop infection - Use proper immunizations! UBC SBM Misconceptions Homeopathy is NOT naturopathy. - But often naturopaths practice homeopathy All who trained in BC are taught it - Homeopathy = lots and lots of dilutions UBC SBM Examples Oscillococcinum - Very popular as \"flu treatment\" or \"vaccine\" - Duck liver and heart diluted 10400 times - No evidence to work \"Neurexan\" sleeping pill - Made from coffee! - Famously, people try to overdose on it They can't. UBC SBM Ethics It is unethical to knowingly give a patient a placebo without telling them - Truth telling Homeopathy has been shown consistently to be no different from placebo. Therefore, it is unethical to not inform people that it is no better than placebo. UBC SBM Summary Homeopathy started in Germany in 1700s, not thousands of years ago. Belief that \"like cures like\" - At infinitesimal doses No good evidence that it works No scientific plausibility that it could work Ultimately: Very expensive water UBC References its Origin; its Conflict, Gould & Son, London 1885. p.103.
