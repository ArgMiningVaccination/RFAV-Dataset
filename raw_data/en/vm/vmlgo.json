His daily routine starts with an early workout and caps off with a family meal around the table.My days start early. With three boys ages 8, 6 and 3, I need to head to the gym by 5:00 a.m. There are a lot of people at the gym in the morning trying to balance their schedules and nd time for their health. Like them, if I don 't make time to work out in the morning, I won 't get there, so having a routine and consistency is key. The back-to-school season can add complexity. Take this time to establish healthy habits for you and your family. To get my day started, I make or purchase smoothies. If I have to be at the of ce early, I grab a bottled shake and a banana. The challenge with kids is limiting sugar. A great breakfast option is oatmeal with walnuts and raisins. We also stock low-sugar cereals and always have Greek yogurt. We do menu preparation for dinnertime, which has saved our tails forever. Having a plan is the most important step to having a meal ready to share as a family, even if the plan is to pick up premade meals from Hy-Vee or eat together at the ballpark. Read about the bene ts of family meals on page 42 and commit to making dinnertime a priority. Hy-Vee can help parents manage this busy time of year and help kids start the school year strong. At the Hy-Vee Pharmacy, you can check to see what vaccines your child needs and get them taken care of on the spot or you can stop by for a fl u shot, all without an appointment. Read more on preventative services available at Hy-Vee in \" An Ounce of Prevention, \" page 54 . A new school year is an exciting time of change and growth.

I do a 20-minute workout where I do a hard one minute, and then an easy two minutes. I'll do that four to six times, so I end up burning 200 calories in that period of time. MEDICAL Dr. Joseph Brunkhorst, D.O., Sports Medicine and Knee, Hip and Shoulder Surgeon at DMOS Orthopaedic Center, Ankeny, Iowa I would reinforce the importance of fl exibility and proprioceptive strength. Therefore, doing some quick, easy stretching when you rst get out of bed or even in the shower or while brushing your teeth will help keep your muscles and tendons healthy and decrease risk of injury. Proprioceptive strength will help decrease risk of ankle sprains and can be improved with balance exercises. While standing at the kitchen counter, one can work on standing on one foot alone for 30 seconds. Once that is mastered, do it with your eyes closed. MEDICAL Dr. Matthew DeWall, M.D., Sports Medicine and Knee and Hip Surgeon at DMOS Orthopaedic Center, West Des Moines, Iowa Try to nd time during your normal schedule to squeeze in some exercise.

A: Artificial sweeteners are a better option if you are trying to cut your calories. They can still satisfy that sweet tooth. Just don't overdo it. Everything in moderation! Q: How much sugar should we have? A: The new dietary guidelines recommend that no more than 10 percent of your daily calories come from added sugars. For most of us this is no more than 100 to 150 calories, or 25 to 36 grams. Q: How can customers cut back on sugar? A: Eat whole foods instead of sugary treats. Eat more protein, which digests more slowly and will help you feel full longer, and fill up on whole grains with plenty of fiber, which will give you the prolonged energy your body needs. Q: Where can you find unexpected sugar? A: Although some foods don't seem sweet, look out for the hidden sugars. Condiments like barbecue sauce, salad dressing and even ketchup can have some extra sugar. Most fat-free products cut out fat but may replace it with sugar, so get in the habit of reading the label. TRUTHTHESWEETHY-VEE DIETITIANS: Julie is a Registered Dietitian and the Assistant Vice President o f Retail Dietetics for Hy-Vee. Talk to the dietitian at your local Hy-Vee for help managing the sugars in your diet! Q: What are sugars? A: Scientifically, sugars are a class of carbohydrates. There are many types of natural sugars, includingglucose, fructose (sugar found in fruit), lactose (the most common sugar found in milk), galactose (another sugar found in milk),sucrose (table sugar) and maltose (malt sugar).Carbohydrates are needed for energy, so some natural sugars are OK. Q: What are the dangers of too much sugar? A: Eating and drinking too many high-sugar foods can potentially result in poor nutrition, weight gain, increased triglycerides and tooth decay. Added sugar is a simple carbohydrate with very little nutritional benefit and a heavy load of calories. Foods and beverages high in sugar generally contribute to extra unwanted calories in your diet. Q: Why is sugar in so many foods we eat? A: Taste is the number one reason sugar is added to so many products. However, sugar can also play an important function in many products. Baked products require sugar not only for taste but for a desirable texture and color. A little is needed in bread to help it rise effectively. Sugar also helps to balance the acidity of foods containing vinegar and tomatoes, and it preserves produce in jams and jellies.QAAND PHOTOS Cameron Sadeghpour Q: Are BALANCE 006-009 Dietitian-MorningRoutine-Ad_07-20 2.indd 6 8/2/17 10:19 AM RAW SUGAR From sugarcane or sugar beets.

With each revolution of the rope, alternate foot positions, landing on both feet simultaneously. Continue for 30 to 60 seconds. 3 CRISSCROSS COORDINATION Begin jumping rope normally. When rope passes overhead, start to cross hands, completing the motion at hip level. Hands should reach opposite hip as rope touches the fl oor.

HE'S ONE OF THE MOST EFFICIENT AND DEPENDABLE PLAYERS IN THE LEAGUE. HE'S THE BACKBONE OF A FOOTBALL REVIVAL IN KANSAS CITY THAT'S TRANSFORMED THE CHIEFS INTO A TOP FIVE WINNINGEST TEAM OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS. THOUGH HE'S KNOWN FOR HIS LEVELHEADED CONSISTENCY ON THE FIELD, HE'S HAD A WINDING ROLLER-COASTER RIDE OF A CAREER. Contagious passion is everywhere in Kansas City, and Smith credits his ongoing love of the game to the Chiefs ' unstoppable support system. \"Around the community, the support they have for you here is so crazy,\" Smith says. \"The sense of pride for the Chiefs, the colors and Arrowhead Stadium ... it all jumps out at you. You show up to Arrowhead on game day and it 's such a different feel of fans.\" Smith thrives in the close-knit community, which brings back memories of playing college football, the ful llment of his childhood dream. In his rst season with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2013, Smith led the team to a 9-0 start and the team's rst playoff win since 1994, rebounding from a two-win season the year before. Smith was recognized for his individual performance as well, earning his rst Pro Bowl selection. The team bene ted from opening its playbook to him, implementing his previously underutilized rushing ability and making him a legitimate dual-threat option. BALANCE | September 2017 18 018-025 10:09 AM\"I DON 'T EVEN THINK ABOUT LEGACY. WHEN YOU PUT IN THIS MUCH TIME, I THINK IT 'S MORE JUST THE CHALLENGE OF, 'CAN WE DO THIS RIGHT? CAN WE FIND A WAY AS A TEAM? CAN I FIND A WAY AS A QUARTERBACK? CAN WE FIND A WAY TO GET IT DONE? ' OBVIOUSLY, EVERY OTHER TEAM AND GUY IS TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING, AND WHO 'S GONNA DO IT THE BEST? \" -ALEX SMITH\"\"I DONI DON THIS MUCH TIME, I THINK ITTHIS MUCH TIME, I THINK IT OF, OF, ''CAN WE DO THIS RIGHT?CAN WE DO THIS RIGHT? TEAM? CAN I FIND A WAY TEAM? CAN I FIND A WAY FIND A WAY TO FIND A WAY TO In his four seasons as the Chiefs ' starting quarterback, Smith already holds the franchise record for career rushing yards by a quarterback (2,078), and his 312 consecutive completions without an interception during the 2015 season ranks second all-time behind Tom Brady. Statistically, Smith has had the best four-year start ever by a Chiefs quarterback, leading the team to 41 regular season wins and three playoff appearances, closing out the 2016 season with his second Pro Bowl appearance. PATH TO VICTORY In college, Smith led the University of Utah to victory at the 2005 Fiesta Bowl and a national top- ve nish during his junior season. He was an All-American quarterback with all of the tools to be great. \"I was a huge college football fan. My uncle coached at the college level, my dad played college football. I loved being a student-athlete, playing for your school and the selfl essness,\" Smith says. Smith, a three-year graduate, was drafted in 2005 No. 1 overall and praised as a savior by the San Francisco 49ers; he was given the keys to a franchise in distress and expected to lead it to the promised land. He was a talented rookie with high expectations. But after several disappointing seasons lled with growing pains and a revolving door of coaches and teammates, Smith became a target of blame for eager fans and national pundits. His perceived inability to make game-breaking plays and his conservative approach made some question whether he was the right t. But Smith tuned out the noise, learned from his experiences and continually looked ahead at the bigger picture. \"You learn to embrace the challenge. I learned to embrace game day ... to embrace the expectations a little more,\" Smith says. \"I think when I was younger, sometimes I felt the weight of all that pressure in the form of anxiety.\" His experience and boosted con dence, along with an aggressive new coaching staff, transformed the team into a winner. The 49ers took the league by storm and broke an eight-year playoff drought in 2011. Even in light of this success, many still questioned whether Smith was the solution for the hottest team in football, powered by a physical run game and an attacking defense. Heading into the next season, an underestimated Smith took this disrespect as a challenge and quickly became one of the league 's most ef cient quarterbacks, guiding his team to a 6-2 start and thoughts of a championship. Just when things couldn't get better, he was sidelined with a concussion and replaced in the starting lineup. He was later traded during the 2013 off-season to a struggling Kansas City Chiefs squad. This move turned out to be the perfect t for a guy who's fueled by a deep passion for the game and values the loyalty of die-hard Chiefs fans. A 13-year veteran, Smith has experienced the gamut of professional football. He's used those experiences to grow as a player, but more importantly to him, he has gained the con dence to be comfortable with himself. \"Nobody has an easy road, nobody. Tom Brady, Peyton Manning\u2014all those guys\u2014Joe Montana. Nobody's got it easy. Everybody's road is different. Everybody deals with crap. It's the guys that can handle it and move on that overcome, get better and keep getting up. Those are the guys that play a long time and, I think, succeed ultimately,\" Smith says. He's no longer a wide-eyed rookie, only looking to avoid mistakes. He's a resilient, battle-tested quarterback\u2014a calculated surgeon between the hashes. He's the real Chief of Kansas City.

ANSWER. Obviously, in season, football takes a priority and rightfully so. It 's actually a fun dynamic. It 's so fun every year to buckle down and have this big goal to work and strive for. A lot of people don 't get that in life. In the off-season, it definitely shifts. My family takes a priority, because they sacrifice so much in season. QUESTION. Was it your dream to play professional football? ANSWER. No. I dreamt about playing college football. I was a huge college football fan. I grew up on the West Coast, so you name the PAC 10 team. QUESTION. Did you play any other sports besides football? ANSWER. I grew up playing soccer, but I also played golf, basketball and baseball growing up. I 've skied since I was 2 years old. Snowboarding, skateboarding, you name the sport, I feel like I 've done it. And that 's just the way it was. I was just very active, and that was the best part about growing up in San Diego. There was no winter. Year- round, I was playing sports. QUESTION. How important is the mental side of sports? ANSWER. There certainly are a portion of plays, playing quarterback, that you can 't prepare for. Your preparation is going to help you on those plays and timing and all the reps we do on the practice field and that stuff. Football also is just an instinctive sport, and things break down and stuff happens, and your instincts have to take over and you have to trust them. QUESTION. What are your thoughts on injuries from football? ANSWER. Very real. I won 't let my kids play until high school. They can play flag football and play all the other sports. I loved high school football and at that point, I think everybody 's kind of mature and there 's an even playing field.QUESTION. What's the best way to keep a healthy lifestyle? ANSWER. There are so many different ways to do it. Everybody has different ways. Yoga, dance, working out, CrossFit, you name it. Playing pickup, jogging, running, whatever. Whatever your deal is, go do it. Just keep doing and keep trying new things. Don 't be afraid. I think it 's easy to shy away from stuff. I think just keep going, learning, doing more. QUESTION. What's your diet like? ANSWER. When I 'm in a routine, I try to eat really healthy, but at the same time I think you also have to have balance, and there 's gotta be times to let loose and you gotta know when you can do that. You can 't be so strict that you go crazy with it. I eat pretty clean, mostly natural and organic stuff and certainly low-sugar. But there 's certainly times when you splurge. QUESTION. Most surprising death on Game of Thrones? ANSWER. (Spoiler alert!) Oh, you gotta go to Season One and Ned Stark. You were such a fan of his, I couldn 't actually believe it, especially because it was the first season. His wife and son would be like number two in line. That was definitely pretty rough. QUESTION. Has there been a new activity you're terrible at? ANSWER. Oh, for sure. We have a basketball hoop in our locker room. The deal is, especially during the season, the quarterbacks play once a week. So every Thursday, we play \"C-H-I-E-F-S. \" I didn 't play in high school, but I grew up playing basketball. These guys are ridiculous. They shoot all day in there, and they 're really good. So, yeah, I get crushed at \"C-H-I-E-F-S,\" so I make them play with trick shots. No straight shots. You gotta do trick shots. It gives me a much better chance. QUESTION. Any childhood nicknames? ANSWER. Axe Handle, because I was skinny. QUESTION. What are your plans after football? ANSWER. I have this huge wealth of knowledge and I could take it straight into something geared around football, whether it be coaching, or TV or analyzing. Part of me, though, is definitely of the mind-set that when football is done, I 'm done, and I want to go do something else. Life is too short to keep it about the game, and I have too many other interests to not go try to explore those. So, I 'm really torn with that. Luckily, I don 't have to make that decision today. 22 BALANCE | September 2017 018-025 Alex Smith_7.17 2.indd 22 23 8/1/17 10:09 AMNOTHING MAKES YOU WALK THE WALK MORE THAN HAVING KIDS, ESPECIALLY LITTLE BOYS THAT WATCH MY EVERY MOVE.

I just grew up always giving back, being grateful for what I have and knowing there are others out there that are less fortunate. It 's always been ingrained in me. I grew up volunteering. And then when I got drafted, I knew I wanted to do something. QUESTION. How did you decide you wanted to help support foster children? ANSWER. When I first got exposed to the reality of what happens to foster kids as they age out of the system, I was 20 or 21, and a lot of these kids were 18 or 19 years old, so I wasn 't that far removed from them. But I was in a different world as far as life experiences. My parents drove me up to college and moved me into the dorms, and if anything went wrong they were a phone call away. These kids were 18 and were the complete opposite. They were getting dropped off at a shelter, not college, and their stuff got thrown into a trash bag and handed to them. They had a different reality. I was worried about being a college kid and getting up for class and practice, and these guys had to worry about where they were gonna sleep and what they were gonna eat that day. I couldn 't imagine doing what these kids were doing. QUESTION. What do you hope to help them achieve? ANSWER. It's all about staying in school, finishing school and being a normal kid. None of these kids finish high school. They have so many mounting obstacles and walk that path alone. So for me, the whole goal is to help these kids focus on what they should be focusing on. That 's just being a student and focusing on finishing school. QUESTION. How does the foundation help these kids focus on school? ANSWER. If these kids are ever gonna have a chance, you have to take some of that burden off of them. [The foundation] helps with that, provides support, motivates, takes out some of that stuff and lets them be normal kids, normal 18-year-olds, worried about normal things.

But the pain doesn't stop there. A 20-year-long study by the American Academy of Pediatrics discovered that the rate of ACL tears, the most common knee injury, has increased 2.3 percent annually among adolescents (ages 6-18). The worst part is, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than half of these sports-related injuries were preventable. If injury treatment and prevention have advanced farther than ever, why the increase? Many experts credit overtraining as the main factor in the rise of knee-related injuries. \"This increase is likely the result of aggressive sports participation, rather than any change occurring within children,\" says Dr. Matthew DeWall, a hip and knee surgeon at DMOS Orthopaedic Centers, who specializes in sports medicine. \"It 's becoming more and more common for children and adolescents to participate in competitive sports, often nearly year-round,\" DeWall says. An ultracompetitive environment has youth athletes playing more than ever, with 60 percent of kids playing organized sports outside of school-based teams. To put it simply, kids are being pushed harder than ever to achieve athletic success and it's costing them their health. Developing growth plates and lack of proper muscle maturity make it difficult for children to sustain such rigorous activities without injury. \"Adolescent knees may be more susceptible to chronic or overuse injuries, as younger athletes are often the least involved in cross-training and strength, stretching and conditioning exercises,\" DeWall says. \"These more ' boring ' aspects of sports are often overlooked or resisted by the younger athlete but can be vital to joint health.\" APPLY THE R.I.C.E.

BALANCE | hy-vee.com 27 026-029 Joint Effort_7.10.indd 27 8/1/17 10:24 AMThe knee is a complex joint that allows the leg to bend and support body weight. It connects the thigh bone (femur) and lower leg (tibia and fibula) with four main ligaments (ACL, LCL, MCL and PCL) and a group of muscles. Known as soft tissue, this area is shielded by the kneecap (patella). The kneecap is a sesamoid which is an uncommon type of bone embedded within soft tissue. Because of this somewhat unusual soft tissue attachment, the knee is highly flexible. However, range of motion comes at a cost, as it puts the knee at a greater risk of damage from stress loads. Two crescent-shaped pieces of cartilage (menisci) act as shock absorbers to protect the knee. OF SPORTS-RELATED INJURIES AMONG CHILDREN OCCUR DURING PRACTICE, ACCORDING TO JOHNS HOPKINS MEDICINE.

JOSEPH BRUNKHORST, D.O., SPORTS MEDICINE AND KNEE, HIP AND SHOULDER SURGEON AT DMOS ORTHOPAEDIC CENTERS: Q. WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON KNEE PROBLEMS THAT YOU SEE IN ADOLESCENTS? A. Overuse injuries are seen very commonly and include \"jumper 's knee\" (pain or damage to the patellar tendon) and \"runner 's knee\" (pain from abnormal contact and movement patterns of the patella). I also see patella dislocations, meniscus tears and ligament tears. In adults, the main knee problem is osteoarthritis. This is a degenerative breakdown of the cartilage of the joint and the cause is multifactorial, but genetics seems to play the biggest role. Q. ARE THERE MOVEMENTS WE SHOULD AVOID? A. Pivots, cutting and sudden stops put the knee ligaments and menisci at increased risk of injury. As one ages, these structures become more vulnerable to injury when undergoing the maneuvers. Q. ARE THERE WAYS TO PREVENT JOINT DISEASES, LIKE ARTHRITIS? A. Unfortunately, there really isn 't a pill you can take to prevent arthritis. Some people are more at risk to suffer from arthritis due to their genetics. Trauma is a predisposing factor, and if one can avoid injury or repeated injury to the knee, they can reduce the risk of arthritis. Also, maintaining a healthy weight is important in decreasing the risk of developing arthritis. Q. HOW CAN PARENTS WITH CHILDREN PLAYING SPORTS PREVENT KNEE INJURIES? A. Listen and talk to [your] kids. Make sure they are getting enough rest and are not trying to play through pain. There are also ACL prevention prehab programs that can be initiated through sports and usually involve specific dynamic warm-up routines. Every parent with a kid in sports and every coach should be familiar with the website stopsportsinjuries .org. This website discusses how sports injuries can be prevented.

Although he 's a fan of interval training (short periods of intense anaerobic exercise with lower-intensity active-recovery periods), he warns against overdoing it. \" When you overdo it, you risk hurting your joints and spraining muscles, \" he says. \" Mix it up. Walk a day, swim a day, bike a day, so you can rest body parts. \" To exercise most effectively you need to understand your heartbeat. It tells whether you're working hard enough to get results without going overboard. Before you exercise aerobically, find this heartbeat zone or range, and monitor it throughout your routine. Here 's how health and exercise experts generally suggest you find the bull 's-eye: First, determine your maximum heart rate (MHR). This is the upper limit of what your cardiovascular system can handle during strenuous exercise. It can be found by subtracting your age from 220. The result represents the maximum number of beats per minute your heart should reach during exercise. Next, calculate a percentage of your maximum as a cruising zone for most of your workout. The American College of Sports Medicine suggests 50 to 65 percent of your MHR if you are just beginning to exercise regularly and up to 85 percent if you are more experienced.L Periodically check your heart rate to ensure it is gradually increasing during warm-up, at targeted speed for the workout, and slowly dropping during your cooldown. EVERY WORKOUT SHOULD START WITH A WARM-UP AND END WITH A COOLDOWN. A WARM-UP PREPS YOUR BODY FOR EXERCISE BY SLOWLY INCREASING HEART RATE AND BLOOD FLOW. THE COOLDOWN ACCLIMATES IT TO RESTING STATE.

To limit interrupting your routine, check your pulse rate for 15 seconds and multiply by 4 to get your beats per minute. Place your index and third fingers over the radial artery, located under the thumb, or on your neck to the side of your windpipe over the carotid artery.WORKOUT MACHINE. Some exercise machines have built-in heart rate monitors to calculate your target heart rate and provide ongoing readings. Follow the manufacturer 's instructions to enter your age and other information.HEART RATE MONITOR. Wearable bands and watches can be inconsistent, so make sure to find your normal range over time and use manual methods if you see a surprising heart rate. Some wearable tech even include calorie counters and GPS for tracking distance and number of steps taken (biking, running).ON YOUR OWN. Once you 're in a normal exercise routine, you can get a good idea of your target heart rate by listening to your body. High-paced breathing, heavy sweating and inability to carry a conversation after 10 minutes might mean you should slow down.138bpm 034-037 To the Beat_07-13 2.indd 35 8/1/17 10:17 AMR TOOLS OF THE TRADE FITNESS TRACKERS Track fitness or check vitals with these helpful workout accessories.

If you 're not there yet, build up to it. \" The average person isn't doing that much physical activity to start, and a moderate level is a good idea, \" says kinesiology and nutrition Professor Craig Horswill. A good starting point could be walking 100 steps per minute on level terrain, starting with a 10-minute walk and eventually moving on to a 30-minute walk (3,000 steps). Going beyond your ability risks burnout, muscle strains, tendonitis and more. Listen to your body. These signs will tell you when you're working too hard: SORE, TIGHT MUSCLES Start workouts slowly and build up. Otherwise, muscles and joints can tighten and become extremely sore. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends amping up in 5 percent increments each time the routine seems too easy. IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT Studies reported by Cleveland Clinic and Mayo Clinic said some endurance athletes who exercised extremely for marathons, triathlons and long-distance cycling developed arrythmia and other heart damage. INSOMNIA Research also indicates that even moderate daytime exercise can have a hormonal effect on some people, which can affect their nighttime sleep. IRRITABILITY/DEPRESSION Anxiety, mood changes and depression can occur when your body is overstressed and constantly fatigued. \"HEART RATE MONITORS ...

YOUR BODY 'S CONTROL CENTER, YOUR BRAIN RUNS THE SHIP, TELLING ALL OTHER BODY PARTS AND SYSTEMS WHAT TO DO. IT 'S A HIGHLY COMPLEX JOB, AND TO DO IT, THE BRAIN HAS SEVERAL MAJOR PARTS. EACH ONE PLAYS A SPECIFIC ROLE IN CONTROLLING BODILY FUNCTIONS AND KEEPING THE BOAT ON COURSE. CEREBRUM Similar to a globe, the cerebrum is split into two halves called hemispheres. The left hemisphere controls analytical thought, reasoning, language and logic. It also processes mathematical and scientific reasoning. The right hemisphere engages in more abstract activities and increases your awareness to music, art, imagination, insight, and ability to process three-dimensional images. The right hemisphere controls the left hand, and the left hemisphere controls the right hand. One part of the cerebrum, called the prefrontal cortex, located just beneath the forehead, processes short-term memory and stores longer-term memories. CEREBELLUM This heart-shaped tissue mass controls the body's balance and coordination. It also fine-tunes motor functions that allow you to eat, swim, walk and even write. BRAIN STEM Found at the base of the brain just above the spinal cord, the brain stem controls autonomic functions in the body (the functions that do not require conscious effort or thought). These include digestion, hunger, thirst, sleep, blood pressure and emotional behaviors. It also regulates body temperature, controls eye movements and allows you to create facial expressions. PITUITARY GLAND It may be only the size of a pea, but the pituitary gland plays a herculean role in many bodily functions. It regulates the release of many hormones in the body that affect growth, development and metabolism. Also known as the master gland, it produces and orchestrates the release of hormones and helps control other glands such as adrenal, ovaries, thyroid and testicles. 38 BALANCE | September 2017 038-041 Brain Games 7.7 2.indd 38 8/1/17 10:31 AM GAM ESPEOPLE ALREADY FACING COGNITIVE CHALLENGES CAN STILL REAP BENEFITS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. \"WHEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS HAVE AN EXERCISE REGIMEN, THEIR SYMPTOMS PROGRESS MORE SLOWLY,\" SAYS DR.

Mental health is your emotional, psychological and social well- being\u2014how you think, how you feel and how you behave. It helps determine how you respond to stress, relate to others and make choices. A number of factors can affect mental health, including genetics, chemical imbalances in the brain, having a family member who has mental illness and experiencing abuse or trauma. \"Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood,\" says Dr. James Ellison, M.D. THE ACADEMY OF NUTRITION AND DIETETICS RECOMMENDS YOU EAT MORE OF THE FOLLOWING TO KEEP YOUR BRAIN HEALTHY: BERRIES BROCCOLI CAULIFLOWER CHERRIES KALE SALMON SARDINES SPINACH TUNA WALNUTSExercise is one of the best things you can do to keep your mind sharp.

Sleep helps the brain rest, store memory and rejuvenate itself. \"Sleep is generally more successful when a person establishes a regimen of going to bed and waking up at the same time and aims for at least 8 hours of sleep,\" advises Ellison. 43 The human brain works 24/7/365 and generates enough electricity to power a lightbulb.

THE BENEFITS WILL BUILD A BETTER FAMILY! READY , READY , READY SET WORDS , SET, GO! COMMUNICATION Make mealtime a meeting point for the whole family (without feeling forced or formal). For kids, regular meals at the table increase communication and take the pressure off talking through tricky topics. Teens who eat family meals at least five times a week have a much lower risk of using drugs and alcohol than teens who eat two or fewer family meals per week. TRUST Build better relationships. According to the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, dinners provide a time and place for family members to talk about their day, which helps parents show kids they are a priority. Over time, this turns into trust and interest. Studies show that children who eat frequent meals with their family have closer relationships to their siblings and parents. AWARENESS Keep tabs on your kids. Parents who consistently spend time with their children can keep an eye on behavior patterns. This makes them more likely to recognize behavioral changes, which may be an indication of an issue.Hy-Vee is proud to be a recognized leader in National Family Meals Month, a nationwide event designed to promote the signi cant bene ts of regular family meals.

MYTH : SCRUBBING SKIN MAKES IT GLOW. Exfoliating a few times a week can be an important part of your skin cleansing routine, but remember to be gentle with yourself and avoid rough loofahs or scratchy sponges. MYTH : TOO MUCH WASHING DAMAGES SKIN. Some people believe that cleansing your skin too much strips it of oils, encouraging it to make more. This might be true if you use a drying, harsh product. Instead, stick to a gentle cleanser, like Dove. Or try new Dove Shower Foam for a lightweight, airy lather that rinses quickly and hydrates skin. MYTH : HOT WATER IS BEST. Wave good-bye to those hot, long steamy showers: Hot water can actually be bad for your skin. It can strip skin's natural moisturizing oils, leaving it dry and sensitive. So if you've been experiencing dry skin, stick to warm water in the shower. MYTH : IT'S NORMAL FOR SKIN TO FEEL TIGHT AFTER WASHING. If your skin feels tight after washing, you're using the wrong shower products.

Pharmacists often recommend screenings, which are usually carried out by Hy-Vee dietitians. Hy-Vee also offers the Begin \u00ae Healthy Lifestyle and Weight Management Program, a 10-week course which helps patients manage their weight and reduce risk for disease. Hy-Vee also has a diabetes-speci c Begin \u00ae program to help customers better manage their diet. Some pharmacists also offer special screenings. For instance, Jane Allen occasionally sets up free osteoporosis screenings using equipment from Drake University. Patients' foot bones are analyzed to determine if there is any indication of osteoporosis\u2014a deterioration of the bones\u2014becoming a future problem. Hy-Vee pharmacists are always ready to answer your health questions.HEALTH SCREENINGS: Your body by the numbersSupplements While not intended to be a substitute for food, dietary supplements can provide you with essential ber, nutritients and protective substances. Talk to your Hy-Vee pharmacist about the research backing products ' health claims. Jane says, \"Some supplements are helpful but only if you take the right type. \" Patients often ask about taking a daily small-dose, 81 mg aspirin to lower risk of heart attack. It is recommended for those who have had or are at high risk of having a heart attack or stroke. Other low-cost, over-the-counter drugs include pills to tame seasonal allergies, prevent upper respiratory tract infections and avoid irregularity. Though multivitamins aren't necessary for all of us, Jane says they can help people with poor diets or those whose bodies lack some essential vitamins that may not be properly absorbing. To prevent health issues, Jane says, \"If someone is lacking in speci c nutrients, they will de nitely need to start taking a multivitamin. Nobody's diet is perfect.\" Ask for your pharmacist's advice in selecting a multivitamin.

But in a weakened state, often infl uenced by poor diet and other unhealthy lifestyle choices, our immune system can be confused into attacking healthy tissue, leading to long-lasting infl ammation that opens our bodies to disease. \"Chronic infl ammation has side effects that aren 't good, \" says Hy-Vee Dietitian Amber Groeling in Topeka, Kansas. \"Eating deeply colored green, red and orange vegetables and fruits, plus proteins rich in omega-3 fats, combats that problem. \" Try the recipes ahead to ll up on foods that help reduce infl ammation . with baked Inflammation_7.26 2.indd 56 8/1/17 10:45 AM BERRY-FARRO salad O s a s a s l l a l d Total Time 40 minutes Serves 4 1 cup dried farro 4 (4-oz.) salmon fillets Hy-Vee nonstick olive oil1 Tbsp. juice2 garlic cloves, minced1 Tbsp. finely chopped parsley, plus more for garnish4 cups baby spinach2 cups sliced strawberries1 small jicama, peeled and cut into matchsticks (about 1 cup) 1 cup blueberries, halving large berries1 oz.

ALL YOU NEED IS A STURDY CHAIR AND FOUR BASIC MOVES. TARGET EVERY MAJOR MUSCLE GROUP with micro movements that sculpt and stretch. Barre classes stem from the work of ballerina Lotte Berk, who opened her first barre studio in New York City in 1971. Looking for a way to keep her body toned and flexible, Berk developed movements that could help women strengthen their bodies in a manner that keeps muscles lean and supple. Today, typical barre classes combine Berk 's work with practices from yoga as well as Pilates. Low-impact moves protect joints and offer a workout safe for all ages. SLIM DOWN AND TONE UP Through small muscle contractions and micro movements, barre classes burn fat, and create long, lean physiques. Typical classes emphasize full-body work, including core, and retain many of the traditional positions of Berk 's original concept. This 1ST POSITION PLI\u00c9 Stand with right side to chair and right hand rested lightly on chairback, left arm lifted. Bring heels together with toes turned outward slightly. Relev\u00e9; lift heels from floor. Pli\u00e9; bend at knees to lower. Knees should track over toes. 2ND POSITION PLI\u00c9 Stand with right side to chair and right hand rested lightly on chairback. Step feet out wider than hips, turning toes slightly outward. Relev\u00e9; lift heels from floor. Pli\u00e9; bend at knees to lower. Repeat, adding a bicep curl to incorporate arm work. CHAIR WITH STABILITY BALL Stand facing chairback, arm's length away; hold chairback in both hands. With ball between thighs, hinge knees and hips 90 degrees, stacking knees above ankles and shoulders above hips. Relev\u00e9; lift heels from floor. Engage core to keep spine straight. Squeeze ball with tiny pulses. SINGLE LEG LIFTS Stand facing chair, and hold chairback in both hands. Lift right leg back and up, keeping hips square to chair and right toes pointed. Lower and lift leg or hold at top and pulse. Maintain a slight knee bend in standing leg to protect joints.encourages long, lean muscle development. PROP SHOP Most studios will provide any equipment your instructors choose to implement. These often include hand weights, therapy bands and stability balls. Toss together a gym bag with plenty of bottled water and a hand towel. If you have a yoga mat, pack it as well or pick one up at your local Hy-Vee store. SUIT UP Barre moves call for bare feet and fitted leggings or spandex shorts. These options provide the widest range of motion and won't make you timid about sending legs into the air. A sports bra for women and loose-fitting tanks are the norm. For men, compression shorts are advisable under a pair of regular shorts. Many studios offer classes at increased room temperatures to pick up the workout intensity. In those cases wear quick-drying fabrics that will wick away sweat.means sculpted arms, toned thighs and a lifted bottom. Many barre studios integrate motivational playlists to keep students fired up and heart rates pumping so they burn fat while they break a sweat. Approachable workout sequences help engage students of all levels and include a thorough cooldown to prevent injuriesand promote lean muscle growth. EMBRACE THE SHAKE Just before the point of fatigue, many students will feel their body begin to shake. Don't give up! The goal of every class is to target specific muscles to be pushed to their limit, and that challenge equals change. Shaking means you are working hard enough to transform your body. At the end of class you will have plenty of time to recover and stretch out tired muscles while they are still warm and elastic.

Stock up on these items to ght the cold and fl u, or better yet, stave them off: Hand sanitizer Bottles come in all sizes\u2014for a backpack, the glove compartment, a purse and every room in your house. Thoroughly wash hands with soap and hot water. Disinfecting wipes and cleaners Clean surfaces regularly (don 't forget your cell phone!), especially in the kitchen and bath. Keep a stock of disinfectant wipes handy in each room. Basic meds Stock up on cold and fl u relief, right, and purge your medicine cabinet of any expired products. Symptom relief Invest in quality tissues that won 't leave noses raw. Additionally, nasal saline solutions can also help thin mucus and cleanse the nasal passage. To soothe dry or itchy eyes, look for eye drops. A humidi er may help ease congestion and coughing. TALK TO YOUR PHARMACIST \"Ask questions to make sure you 're taking products appropriately, \" says Bob Steffl , Hy-Vee Pharmacy Manager in Albert Lea, Minnesota. Read labels, including warnings, carefully so you don 't duplicate ingredients or mix incompatible ones. \" Most over- the-counter drugs now are combinations, \" notes Steffl . \" Some have acetaminophen with a decongestant and an antihistamine. Another will take out the antihistamine so it 's nondrowsy. \" Look for medications that zero in on your speci c symptoms.BY THE SYMPTOM Cough Use an expectorant for a productive cough to remove mucus from the chest. For a dry, hacking cough try a suppressive with dextromethorphan. Stuffy nose Some prescription nasal sprays are now over-the- counter (OTC). These steroid nasal sprays help with infl ammation. Decongestants in pill form that have pseudoephedrine are found behind the counter; otherwise look for OTC products with phenylephrine. Decongestants narrow blood vessels, so people with high blood pressure or heart disease should be careful using them. Runny nose Antihistamine options include those that help you sleep and nondrowsy ones. Antihistamines can help dry out a drippy runny nose or watery eyes. Aches, fever Acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) or aspirin are common choices. Make sure acetaminophen isn't also in another remedy you 're taking. For children 6 months or younger, give only acetaminophen. The Federal Drug Administration warns against using OTC cold and cough drugs for kids under age 6.

CABINETS, DRAWERS & DOORS Purchase and install childproof locks or latches to keep children out of the trash can, medicine cabinet, garage or any other dangerous area. CARPETS AND RUGS Routinely smooth out carpets and rugs to avoid trips and falls. When walking, clearance from a child 's foot to the ground is much less than that for an adult. CLEANING SUPPLIES Store household cleaners, laundry pods and other poisonous chemicals out of reach of children. Employ childproof locks where needed. Every day, 300 children are poisoned by these items (CDC). DISHWASHER Keep machine doors closed when not loading or unloading. Open doors mean easy access to sharp objects, detergent and a warm, damp environment that can breed harmful bacteria. LOUD NOISES Keep sound levels below 85 decibels. Avoid exposing children to harsh noises from car alarms, loud music and even common children' s toys. These have been measured by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery as generating unsafe decibel levels of 110 to 150. Babies and young children are at a greater risk of hearing damage. ELECTRICAL OUTLETS Shield outlets with plastic covers or plugs to prevent electrical shock. Each year 2,400 children are treated for injuries caused by electrical outlets, according to the Electrical Safety Foundation International. FURNITURE AND LARGE OBJECTS Anchor top-heavy furniture, mirrors, televisions and other unstable objects to walls or floor. Every two weeks, a child dies from a falling television or furniture, according to anchorit.gov. OVENS AND STOVES Install oven knob covers and door locks to prevent children from accidentally using the oven and causing injury or fire.Home cooking equipment is the largest cause of childhood burns. SMALL OBJECTS The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development advises parents to watch out for tiny items or food lying around, as these are the number one source of suffocation among toddlers. WINDOWS Keep shut and install window locks. Additionally, tie up window blind cords to prevent strangulation. Every year, 5,000 children are injured from falling out of windows, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. OH BABY Get a handle on these common household hazards and create a safe living environment for curious tykes. The bad news: Injury is the number one cause of childhood deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The good news: Injuries can be prevented. Shop the aisles of your local Hy-Vee for childproof cabinet locks, doorknob covers, smoke alarms and other items that help protect children from common household dangers.
