I will address the nutrition component. Listed are some nutrient deficiencies that can lead to hair loss: Vitamin A - this vitamin is imperative for the growth and health of all cells and tissues, including the hair and scalp. Vitamin A also is necessary for sebum production, which keeps hair moisturized. To make sure you get enough Vitamin A in your diet pick yellow and orange colored produce and plenty of dark green leafy vegetables. It is also found in animal products like milk and eggs and liver. Please remember moderation because too much Vitamin A can also cause hair loss. The B vitamins that affect hair growth are Vitamin B6, folic acid, and Vitamin B12. These vitamins are important for proper formation of red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the tissues, including the hair. Vitamin B6 is highest in fish, liver, pork and eggs but it is also in wheat germ, and cooked and dried beans and peas. It is also found in soybeans, oats, peanuts, green leafy vegetables, bananas, avocados and cauliflower. Vitamin B12 is found only in animal products. Folic acid is also found in green leafy vegetables and brewer's yeast, fortified cereals and citrus fruit (especially OJ) beets, broccoli and whole grains and tomatoes. Vitamin C - Deficiency of this vitamin leads to hair breakage, because Vitamin C is necessary for collagen production. Like Vitamin A, Vitamin C is also necessary for sebum production. Vitamin C is found in citrus fruits, berries, peppers, dark green leafy vegetables, broccoli , cabbage and sweet potatoes and tomatoes. Iron carries the oxygen in the hemoglobin of the red blood cells. Hair loss is a classic symptom of iron deficiency - anemia. The best source of iron is heme iron, which is only found in meat. Non-heme iron is not absorbed that well. Non-heme iron is found in spinach, dried fruits, beans and bran. Note: Vitamin C helps in the absorption of iron, so squeeze lemon on your spinach! Zinc - this mineral promotes cell reproduction, as well as tissue growth and repair. It also is important for the maintenance of oil-secreting glands attached to the hair follicle. Zinc deficiency can lead to hair shedding. Zinc is found in some meats, eggs, milk, nuts, seeds, legumes and whole grains. Too much zinc can also lead to hair loss so it is best to get enough zinc from foods, rather than over taking it in supplements. Protein - People who do not eat enough protein will have dry and brittle hair. Protein is found in many foods, including meat,seafood, dairy foods, soy, beans, seeds and nuts. Hopefully after evaluating your daily intake, you can add the suggested foods to your diet and with time, see some results and have a healthier head of hair. I will address the nutrition component.
