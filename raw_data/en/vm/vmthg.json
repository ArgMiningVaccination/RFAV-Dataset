JAW-DROPPING RESULTS: An #NCStateVetMed study of whether low-dose radiation therapy could relieve Feline Idiopathic Cystitis has been so successful that clinicians are ready to start offering the treatment to cats at the NC State Veterinary Hospital. Data is pending on the study`s final cat, treated last month, but Dr. Allison Kendall and Dr. Michael Nolan say every other cat has shown improvement, with most never having another episode of cystitis. Archer Seaman, pictured, was the first cat treated in 2021, and he`s been a happy and healthy boy for two years.
