The entire contents of the above-identified applications are hereby fully incorporated herein by reference.REFERENCE TO AN ELECTRONIC SEQUENCE LISTING The contents of the electronic sequence listing (BROD-2970WP_ST25.txt\"; Size is 529,278 bytes and it was created on Dec. 6, 2018) is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.TECHNICAL FIELD The subject matter disclosed herein is generally relates to systems, methods and compositions related to Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and components thereof. The present invention also generally relates to delivery of large payloads and includes novel delivery particles, particularly using lipid and viral particle, and also novel viral capsids, both suitable to deliver large payloads, such as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic protein like), CRISPR-Cas or CRISPR system or CRISPR-Cas complex, components thereof, nucleic acid molecules, e.g., vectors, involving the same and uses of all of the foregoing, amongst other aspects. Additionally, the present invention relates to methods for developing or designing CRISPR-Cas system based therapy or therapeutics.BACKGROUND Recent advances in genome sequencing techniques and analysis methods have significantly accelerated the ability to catalog and map genetic factors associated with a diverse range of biological functions and diseases. Precise genome targeting technologies are needed to enable systematic reverse engineering of causal genetic variations by allowing selective perturbation of individual genetic elements, as well as to advance synthetic biology, biotechnological, and medical applications. Although genome-editing techniques such as designer zinc fingers, transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), or homing meganucleases are available for producing targeted genome perturbations, there remains a need for new genome engineering technologies that employ novel strategies and molecular mechanisms and are affordable, easy to set up, scalable, and amenable to targeting multiple positions within the eukaryotic genome. This would provide a major resource for new applications in genome engineering and biotechnology. The CRISPR-Cas systems of bacterial and archaeal adaptive immunity show extreme diversity of protein composition and genomic loci architecture. The CRISPR-Cas system loci have more than 50 gene families and there is no strictly universal genes indicating fast evolution and extreme diversity of loci architecture. So far, adopting a multi-pronged approach, there is comprehensive cas gene identification of about 395 profiles for 93 Cas proteins. Classification includes signature gene profiles plus signatures of locus architecture. A new classification of CRISPR-Cas systems is proposed in which these systems are broadly divided into two classes, Class 1 with multisubunit effector complexes and Class 2 with single-subunit effector modules exemplified by the Cas9 protein. Novel effector proteins associated with Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems may be developed as powerful genome engineering tools and the prediction of putative novel effector proteins and their engineering and optimization is important. The development of CRISPR-Cas RNA-guided endonucleases for eukaryotic genome editing has sparked intense interest in the use of this technology for therapeutic applications. Extensive research has led to the identification of different technologies which can address the challenges of safety and efficacy. In order to allow the translation of this genome editing technologies to the clinic. There is a need for the development of an algorithm for developing a CRISPR-Cas based therapeutic, which takes into account the different variables which need to be considered. In contrast to small molecule therapies, which target highly conserved protein active sites, treatment of disease at the genomic level contend with significant levels of genetic variation in patient populations. Recently, large scale sequencing datasets from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) and 1000 Genomes Project have provided an unprecedented view of the landscape of human genetic variation. This variation can affect both the efficacy of a CRISPR-based therapeutic, by disrupting the target site, and its safety, by generating off-target candidate sites.

In general, \"nucleic acid-targeting system\" as used in the present application refers collectively to transcripts and other elements involved in the expression of or directing the activity of nucleic acid-targeting CRISPR-associated (\"Cas\") genes (also referred to herein protein), including sequences encoding a nucleic acid-targeting Cas (effector) protein and a guide RNA (comprising crRNA sequence and a trans-activating CRISPR/Cas system RNA (tracrRNA) sequence), or other sequences and from a nucleic acid-targeting CRISPR locus. In some embodiments, one or more elements of a nucleic acid-targeting system are derived from a Type V/Type VI nucleic acid-targeting CRISPR system. In some embodiments, one or more elements of a nucleic acid-targeting system is derived from a particular organism comprising an endogenous nucleic acid-targeting CRISPR system. In general, a nucleic acid-targeting system is characterized by elements that promote the formation of a nucleic acid-targeting complex at the site of a target sequence. In the context of formation of a nucleic acid-targeting complex, \"target sequence\" refers to a sequence to which a guide sequence is designed to have complementarity, where hybridization between a target sequence and a guide RNA promotes the formation of a DNA or RNA-targeting complex. Full complementarity is not necessarily required, provided there is sufficient complementarity to cause hybridization and promote formation of a nucleic acid-targeting complex. A target sequence may comprise RNA polynucleotides. In some embodiments, a target sequence is located in the nucleus or cytoplasm of a cell. In some embodiments, the target sequence may be within an organelle of a eukaryotic cell, for example, mitochondrion or chloroplast. A sequence or template that may be used for recombination into the targeted locus comprising the target sequences is referred to as an \"editing template\" or \"editing RNA\" or \"editing sequence\". In aspects of the invention, an exogenous template RNA may be referred to as an editing template. In an aspect of the invention the recombination is homologous recombination. Typically, in the context of an endogenous nucleic acid-targeting system, formation of a nucleic acid-targeting complex (comprising a guide RNA hybridized to a target sequence and complexed with one or more nucleic acid-targeting effector proteins) results in cleavage of one or both RNA strands in or near (e.g. within 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 50, or more base pairs from) the target sequence. In some embodiments, one or more vectors driving expression of one or more elements of a nucleic acid-targeting system are introduced into a host cell such that expression of the elements of the nucleic acid-targeting system direct formation of a nucleic acid-targeting complex at one or more target sites. For example, a nucleic acid-targeting effector protein and a guide RNA could each be operably linked to separate regulatory elements on separate vectors. Alternatively, two or more of the elements expressed from the same or different regulatory elements, may be combined in a single vector, with one or more additional vectors providing any components of the nucleic acid-targeting system not included in the first vector. Nucleic acid-targeting system elements that are combined in a single vector may be arranged in any suitable orientation, such as one element located 5 with respect to (\"upstream\" of) or 3 with respect to (\"downstream\" of) a second element. The coding sequence of one element may be located on the same or opposite strand of the coding sequence of a second element, and oriented in the same or opposite direction. In some embodiments, a single promoter drives expression of a transcript encoding a nucleic acid-targeting effector protein and a guide RNA embedded within one or more intron sequences (e.g. each in a different intron, two or more in at least one intron, or all in a single intron). In some embodiments, the nucleic acid-targeting effector protein and guide RNA are operably linked to and expressed from the same promoter. In general, a CRISPR system is characterized by elements that promote the formation of a CRISPR complex at the site of a target sequence (also referred to as a protospacer in the context of an endogenous CRISPR system). In the context of formation of a CRISPR complex, \"target sequence\" refers to a sequence to which a guide sequence is designed to target, e.g. have complementarity, where hybridization between a target sequence and a guide sequence promotes the formation of a CRISPR complex. The section of the guide sequence through which complementarity to the target sequence is important for cleavage activity is referred to herein as the seed sequence. A target sequence may comprise any polynucleotide, such as DNA or RNA polynucleotides and is comprised within a target locus of interest. In some embodiments, a target sequence is located in the nucleus or cytoplasm of a cell. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid-targeting effector protein is part of a fusion protein comprising one or more heterologous protein domains (e.g., about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more domains in addition to the nucleic acid-targeting effector protein). In some embodiments, the CRISPR effector protein is part of a fusion protein comprising one or more heterologous protein domains (e.g. about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more domains in addition to the CRISPR enzyme). As used herein, the term \"fuse,\" or \"fused\"\" refers to the covalent linkage between two polypeptides in a fusion protein. The polypeptides may be fused via a peptide bond, either directly to each other or via a linker. The term \"\"fusion protein\" refers to a protein having at least two polypeptides covalently linked, either directly or via a linker (e.g, an amino acid linker). The polypeptides forming a fusion protein may be linked C-terminus to N-terminus, C-terminus to to C-terminus. The polypeptides of the fusion protein may be in any order and may include more than one of either or both of the constituent polypeptides. The term \"fusion the antigens that make up the fusion protein. A fusion protein may be a protein developed from a fusion gene that is created through a joining of two or more genes originally coding for separate proteins. Translation of this fusion gene may result in a single or multiple polypeptides with functional properties derived from each of the original proteins. Fusion proteins of the disclosure may also comprise additional copies of a component antigen or immunogenic fragment thereof. A CRISPR enzyme fusion protein may comprise any additional protein sequence, and optionally a linker sequence between any two domains. Examples of protein domains that may be fused to a CRISPR enzyme include, without limitation, epitope tags, reporter gene sequences, and protein domains having one or more of the following activities: methylase activity, demethylase activity, transcription activation activity, transcription repression activity, transcription release factor activity, histone modification activity, RNA cleavage activity and nucleic acid binding activity. Non-limiting examples of epitope tags include histidine (His) tags, V5 tags, FLAG tags, influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tags, Myc tags, VSV-G tags, and thioredoxin (Trx) tags. Examples of reporter genes include, but are not limited to, glutathione-S-transferase blue fluorescent protein (BFP). A CRISPR enzyme may be fused to a gene sequence encoding a protein or a fragment of a protein that bind DNA molecules or bind other cellular molecules, including but not limited to maltose binding protein (MBP), S-tag, Lex A DNA binding domain fusions, (HSV) BP16 protein fusions. Additional domains that may form part of a fusion protein comprising a CRISPR enzyme are described in US20110059502, incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, a tagged CRISPR enzyme is used to identify the location of a target sequence. In some embodiments, a CRISPR enzyme may form a component of an inducible system. The inducible nature of the system would allow for spatiotemporal control of gene editing or gene expression using a form of energy. The form of energy may include but is not limited to electromagnetic radiation, sound energy, chemical energy and thermal energy. Examples of inducible system include tetracycline inducible promoters (Tet-On or Tet-Off), small molecule two-hybrid transcription systems (FKBP, ABA, etc), or light inducible systems (Phytochrome, LOV domains, or cryptochrome). In one embodiment, the CRISPR enzyme may be a part of a Light Inducible Transcriptional Effector (LITE) to direct changes in transcriptional activity in a sequence-specific manner. The components of a light may include a CRISPR enzyme, a light-responsive transcriptional activation/repression domain.

In some embodiments, a recombination template is also provided. A recombination template may be a component of another vector as described herein, contained in a separate vector, or provided as a separate polynucleotide. In some embodiments, a recombination template is designed to serve as a template in homologous recombination, such as within or near a target sequence nicked or cleaved by a nucleic acid-targeting effector protein as a part of a nucleic acid-targeting complex. In an embodiment, the template nucleic acid alters the sequence of the target position. In an embodiment, the template nucleic acid results in the incorporation of a modified, or non-naturally occurring base into the target nucleic acid. The template sequence may undergo a breakage mediated or catalyzed recombination with the target sequence. In an embodiment, the template nucleic acid may include sequence that corresponds to a site on the target sequence that is cleaved by an Cpf1 mediated cleavage event. In an embodiment, the template nucleic acid may include sequence that corresponds to both, a first site on the target sequence that is cleaved in a first Cpf1 mediated event, and a second site on the target sequence that is cleaved in a second Cpf1 mediated event. In certain embodiments, the template nucleic acid can include sequence which results in an alteration in the coding sequence of a translated sequence, e.g., one which results in the substitution of one amino acid for another in a protein product, e.g., transforming a mutant allele into a wild type allele, transforming a wild type allele into a mutant allele, and/or introducing a stop codon, insertion of an amino acid residue, deletion of an amino acid residue, or a nonsense mutation. In certain embodiments, the template nucleic acid can include sequence which results in an alteration in a non-coding sequence, e.g., an alteration in an exon or in a 5 or 3 non-translated or non-transcribed region. Such alterations include an alteration in a control element, e.g., a promoter, enhancer, and an alteration in a cis-acting or trans-acting control element. A template nucleic acid having homology with a target position in a target gene may be used to alter the structure of a target sequence. The template sequence may be used to alter an unwanted structure, e.g., an unwanted or mutant nucleotide. The template nucleic acid may include sequence which, when integrated, results in: decreasing the activity of a positive control element; increasing the activity of a positive control element; decreasing the activity of a negative control element; increasing the activity of a negative control element; decreasing the expression of a gene; increasing the expression of a gene; increasing resistance to a disorder or disease; increasing resistance to viral entry; correcting a mutation or altering an unwanted amino acid residue conferring, increasing, abolishing or decreasing a biological property of a gene product, e.g., increasing the enzymatic activity of an enzyme, or increasing the ability of a gene product to interact with another molecule. The template nucleic acid may include sequence which results in: a change in sequence of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 or more nucleotides of the target sequence. A template polynucleotide may be of any suitable length, such as about or more than about 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 500, 1000, or more nucleotides in length. In an embodiment, the template an embodiment, the template nucleic acid is 10 to 1,000, 20 to 900, 30 to 800, 40 to 700, 50 to 600, 50 to 500, 50 to 400, 50 to 300, 50 to 200, or 50 to 100 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the template polynucleotide is complementary to a portion of a polynucleotide comprising the target sequence. When optimally aligned, a template polynucleotide might overlap with one or more nucleotides of a target sequences (e.g. about or more than about 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 or more nucleotides). In some embodiments, when a template sequence and a polynucleotide comprising a target sequence are optimally aligned, the nearest nucleotide of the template polynucleotide is within about 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, or more nucleotides from the target sequence. The exogenous polynucleotide template comprises a sequence to be integrated (e.g., a mutated gene). The sequence for integration may be a sequence endogenous or exogenous to the cell. Examples of a sequence to be integrated include polynucleotides encoding a protein or a non-coding RNA (e.g., a microRNA). Thus, the sequence for integration may be operably linked to an appropriate control sequence or sequences. Alternatively, the sequence to be integrated may provide a regulatory function. An upstream or downstream sequence may comprise from about 20 bp to about 2500 bp, for example, about 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2400, or 2500 bp. In some methods, the exemplary upstream or downstream sequence have about 200 bp to about 2000 bp, about 600 bp to about 1000 bp, or more particularly about 700 bp to about 1000. An upstream or downstream sequence may comprise from about 20 bp to about 2500 bp, for example, about 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2400, or 2500 bp. In some methods, the exemplary upstream or downstream sequence have about 200 bp to about 2000 bp, about 600 bp to about 1000 bp, or more particularly about 700 bp to about 1000 In certain embodiments, one or both homology arms may be shortened to avoid including certain sequence repeat elements. For example, a 5 homology arm may be shortened to avoid a sequence repeat element. In other embodiments, a 3 homology arm may be shortened to avoid a sequence repeat element. In some embodiments, both the 5 and the 3 homology arms may be shortened to avoid including certain sequence repeat elements. In some methods, the exogenous polynucleotide template may further comprise a marker. Such a marker may make it easy to screen for targeted integrations. Examples of suitable markers include restriction sites, fluorescent proteins, or selectable markers. The exogenous polynucleotide template of the invention can be constructed using recombinant techniques (see, for example, Sambrook et al., 2001 and Ausubel et al., 1996). In certain embodiments, a template nucleic acids for correcting a mutation may designed for use as a single-stranded oligonucleotide. When using a single-stranded oligonucleotide, 5 and 3 homology arms may range up to about 200 base pairs (bp) in length, e.g., at least 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, or 200 bp in length. Suzuki et al. describe in vivo genome editing via CRISPR/Cas9 mediated homology-independent targeted integration (2016, Nature 540:144-149).

In some examples, a nucleic acid-targeting system may comprise one or more components of a CRISOR-Cas system. Accordingly, in an aspect, the present invention relates to methods for increasing specificity of CRISPR-Cas systems, such as CRISPR-Cas system based therapy or therapeutics. In a further aspect, the invention relates to methods for increasing efficacy of CRISPR-Cas systems, such as CRISPR-Cas system based therapy or therapeutics. In a further aspect, the invention relates to methods for increasing safety of CRISPR-Cas systems, such as CRISPR-Cas system based therapy or therapeutics. In a further aspect, the present invention relates to methods for increasing specificity, efficacy, and/or safety, preferably all, of CRISPR-Cas systems, such as CRISPR-Cas system based therapy or therapeutics. In certain embodiments, the CRISPR-Cas system comprises a CRISPR effector as defined herein elsewhere. The methods of the present invention in particular involve optimization of selected parameters or variables associated with the CRISPR-Cas system and/or its functionality, as described herein further elsewhere. Optimization of the CRISPR-Cas system in the methods as described herein may depend on the target(s), such as the therapeutic target or therapeutic targets, the mode or type of CRISPR-Cas system modulation, such as CRISPR-Cas system based therapeutic target(s) modulation, modification, or manipulation, as well as the delivery of the CRISPR-Cas system components. One or more targets may be selected, depending on the genotypic and/or phenotypic outcome. For instance, one or more therapeutic targets may be selected, depending on (genetic) disease etiology or the desired therapeutic outcome. The (therapeutic) target(s) may be a single gene, locus, or other genomic site, or may be multiple genes, loci or other genomic sites. As is known in the art, a single gene, locus, or other genomic site may be targeted more than once, such as by use of multiple gRNAs. CRISPR-Cas system activity, such as CRISPR-Cas system design may involve target disruption, such as target mutation, such as leading to gene knockout. CRISPR-Cas system activity, such as CRISPR-Cas system design may involve replacement of particular target sites, such as leading to target correction. CISPR-Cas system design may involve removal of particular target sites, such as leading to target deletion. CRISPR-Cas system activity may involve modulation of target site functionality, such as target site activity or accessibility, leading for instance to (transcriptional and/or epigenetic) gene or genomic region activation or gene or genomic region silencing. The skilled person will understand that modulation of target site functionality may involve CRISPR effector mutation (such as for instance generation of a catalytically inactive CRISPR effector) and/or functionalization (such as for instance fusion of the CRISPR effector with a heterologous functional domain, such as a transcriptional activator or repressor), as described herein elsewhere. Accordingly, in another aspect the invention relates to engineered compositions for site directed base editing comprising modified CRISPR effector protein and functional domain(s). In certain embodiments, the functional domains comprise deaminases or catalytic domains thereof, including cytidine and nucleotide deaminases. Example functional domains suitable for use in the embodiments disclosed herein are discussed in further detail below. In the methods and systems of the present invention use is made of a CRISPR-Cas protein and corresponding guide molecule. More particularly, the CRISPR-Cas protein is a class 2 CRISPR-Cas protein. In certain embodiments, said CRISPR-Cas protein Cpf1. The CRISPR-Cas system does not require the generation of customized proteins to target specific sequences but rather a single Cas protein can be programmed by guide molecule to recognize a specific nucleic acid target, in other words the Cas enzyme protein can be recruited to a specific nucleic acid target locus of interest using said guide molecule. Engineered CRISPR-Cas Systems In general, CRISPRs (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), also known as SPIDRs (SPacer Interspersed Direct Repeats), constitute a family of DNA loci that are usually specific to a particular bacterial species. The CRISPR locus comprises a distinct class of interspersed short sequence repeats (SSRs) that were recognized in E. coli (Ishino et al., J. Bacteriol., 169:5429-5433 [1987]; and Nakata et al., J. Bacteriol., 171:3553-3556 [1989]), and associated genes. Similar interspersed in Haloferax mediterranei, Streptococcus loci typically differ from other SSRs by the structure of the repeats, which have been termed short regularly spaced repeats (SRSRs) (Janssen et al., OMICS J. [2000]). In general, the repeats are short elements that occur in clusters that are regularly spaced by unique intervening sequences with a substantially constant length (Mojica et al., [2000], supra). Although the repeat sequences are highly conserved between strains, the number of interspersed repeats and the sequences of the spacer regions typically differ from strain to strain (van Embden et al., J. Bacteriol., 182:2393-2401 [2000]). CRISPR loci have been identified in more than 40 prokaryotes (See e.g., Jansen et al., Mol. Microbiol., 43:1565-1575 [2002]; and Mojica et Molecule The CRISPR-Cas system may comprise one or more guide molecules. The guide molecule or guide RNA of a Class 2 type V CRISPR-Cas protein comprises a tracr-mate sequence (encompassing a \"direct repeat\" in the context of an endogenous CRISPR system) and a guide sequence (also referred to as a \"spacer\" in the context of an endogenous CRISPR system). Indeed, in contrast to the type II CRISPR-Cas proteins, the CRISPR-Cas Cpf1 protein does not rely on the presence of a tracr sequence. In some embodiments, the CRISPR-Cas system or complex as described herein does not comprise and/or does not rely on the presence of a tracr sequence (e.g. if the Cas protein is Cpf1). In certain embodiments, the guide molecule may comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of a direct repeat sequence fused or linked to a guide sequence or spacer sequence. In general, a CRISPR system is characterized by elements that promote the formation of a CRISPR complex at the site of a target sequence. In the context of formation of a CRISPR complex, \"target sequence\" refers to a sequence to which a guide sequence is designed to have complementarity, where hybridization between a target RNA sequence and a guide sequence promotes the formation of a CRISPR complex. The terms \"guide molecule\" and \"guide RNA\" are used interchangeably herein to refer to RNA-based molecules that are capable of forming a complex with a CRISPR-Cas protein and comprises a guide sequence having sufficient complementarity with a target nucleic acid sequence to hybridize with the target nucleic acid sequence and direct sequence-specific binding of the complex to the target nucleic acid sequence. The guide molecule or guide RNA specifically encompasses RNA-based molecules having one or more chemically modifications (e.g., by chemical linking two ribonucleotides or by replacement of one or more ribonucleotides with one or more deoxyribonucleotides), as described herein.Guide Sequence As used herein, the term \"guide sequence\" in the context of a CRISPR-Cas system, comprises any polynucleotide sequence having sufficient complementarity with a target nucleic acid sequence to hybridize with the target nucleic acid sequence and direct sequence-specific binding of a nucleic acid-targeting complex to the target nucleic acid sequence. In the context of the present invention the target nucleic acid sequence or target sequence is the sequence comprising the target adenosine to be deaminated also referred to herein as the \"target adenosine\". In some embodiments, except for the intended dA-C mismatch, the degree of complementarity, when optimally aligned using a suitable alignment algorithm, is about or more than alignment may be determined with the use of any suitable algorithm for aligning sequences, non-limiting example of which include the Smith-Waterman algorithm, the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, algorithms based on SOAP (available at soap.genomics.org.cn), and Maq (available at maq.sourceforge.net). In some embodiments, a guide sequence is about or more than about 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 75, or more nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, a guide sequence is less than about 75, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 12, or fewer nucleotides in length. The ability of a guide sequence (within a nucleic acid-targeting guide RNA) to direct sequence-specific binding of a nucleic acid-targeting complex to a target nucleic acid sequence may be assessed by any suitable assay (as described in EP3009511 or US2016208243). For example, the components of a nucleic acid-targeting CRISPR system sufficient to form a nucleic acid-targeting complex, including the guide sequence to be tested, may be provided to a host cell having the corresponding target nucleic acid sequence, such as by transfection with vectors encoding the components of the nucleic acid-targeting complex, followed by an assessment of preferential targeting (e.g., cleavage) within or in the vicinity of the target nucleic acid sequence, such as by Surveyor assay as described herein. Similarly, cleavage of a target nucleic acid sequence (or a sequence in the vicinity thereof) may be evaluated in a test tube by providing the target nucleic acid sequence, components of a nucleic acid-targeting complex, including the guide sequence to be tested and a control guide sequence different from the test guide sequence, and comparing binding or rate of cleavage at or in the vicinity of the target sequence between the test and control guide sequence reactions. Other assays are possible, and will occur to those skilled in the art. A guide sequence, and hence a nucleic acid-targeting guide RNA may be selected to target any target nucleic acid sequence. In some embodiments, the guide molecule comprises a guide sequence that is designed to have at least one mismatch with the target sequence, such that a RNA-RNA duplex formed between the guide sequence and the target sequence comprises a non-pairing C in the guide sequence opposite to the target A for deamination on the target sequence. In some embodiments, aside from this A-C mismatch, the degree of complementarity, when optimally aligned using a suitable alignment algorithm, is about or more than embodiments, the guide sequence or spacer length of the guide molecules is from 15 to 50 nt. In certain embodiments, the spacer length of the guide RNA is at least 15 nucleotides. In certain embodiments, the spacer length is from 15 to 17 nt, e.g., 15, 16, or 17 nt, from 17 to 20 nt, e.g., 17, 18, 19, or 20 nt, from 20 to 24 nt, e.g., 20, 21, 22, 23, or 24 nt, from 23 to 25 nt, e.g., 23, 24, or 25 nt, from 24 to 27 nt, e.g., 24, 25, 26, or 27 nt, from 27-30 nt, e.g., 27, 28, 29, or 30 nt, from 30-35 nt, e.g., 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, or 35 nt, or 35 nt or longer. In certain example embodiment, the guide sequence is 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or 100 nt. A guide sequence may be selected to target any target sequence. In some embodiments, the target sequence is a sequence within a gene transcript or mRNA. In some embodiments, the target sequence is a sequence within a genome of a cell. In some embodiments, the guide sequence is an RNA sequence of between 10 to 50 nt in length, but more particularly of about 20-30 nt advantageously about 20 nt, 23-25 nt or 24 nt. The guide sequence is selected so as to ensure that it hybridizes to the target sequence comprising the adenosine to be deaminated. This is described more in detail below. Selection can encompass further steps which increase efficacy and specificity of deamination. In some embodiments, the guide sequence is about 20 nt to about 30 nt long and hybridizes to the target RNA strand to form an almost perfectly matched duplex, except for having a dA-C mismatch at the target adenosine site. Particularly, in some embodiments, the dA-C mismatch is located close to the center of the target sequence (and thus the center of the duplex upon hybridization of the guide sequence to the target sequence), thereby restricting the nucleotide deaminase to a narrow editing window (e.g., about 4 bp wide). In some embodiments, the target sequence may comprise more than one target adenosine to be deaminated. In further embodiments the target sequence may further comprise one or more dA-C mismatch 3 to the target adenosine site. In some embodiments, to avoid off-target editing at an unintended Adenine site in the target sequence, the guide sequence can be designed to comprise a non-pairing Guanine at a position corresponding to said unintended Adenine to introduce a dA-G mismatch, which is catalytically unfavorable for certain nucleotide deaminases such as ADAR1 and ADAR2. See Wong et al., RNA 7:846-858 (2001), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, a Cpf1 guide sequence having a canonical length (e.g., about 24 nt for AsCpf1) is used to form a RNA-RNA duplex with the target RNA. In some embodiments, a Cpf1 guide molecule longer than the canonical length (e.g., >24 nt for AsCpf1) is used to form a RNA-RNA duplex with the target RNA including outside of the Cpf1-guide RNA-target RNA complex. This can be of interest where deamination of more than one adenine within a given stretch of nucleotides is of interest. In alternative embodiments, it is of interest to maintain the limitation of the canonical guide sequence length. In some embodiments, the guide sequence is designed to introduce a dA-C mismatch outside of the canonical length of Cpf1 guide, which may decrease steric hindrance by Cpf1 and increase the frequency of contact between the nucleotide deaminase and the dA-C mismatch. In some embodiments, the position of the mismatched nucleobase (e.g., cytidine) is calculated from where the PAM would be on a RNA target.

In some embodiments, the sequence of the guide molecule (direct repeat and/or spacer) is selected to reduce the degree secondary structure within the guide molecule. In some embodiments, about or less than the nucleic acid-targeting guide RNA participate in self-complementary base pairing when optimally folded. Optimal folding may be determined by any suitable polynucleotide folding algorithm. Some programs are based on calculating the minimal Gibbs free energy. An example of one such algorithm is mFold, as described by Zuker and Stiegler (Nucleic Acids Res. 9 (1981), 133-148). Another example folding algorithm is the online webserver RNAfold, developed at Institute for Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Vienna, using the centroid structure prediction algorithm (see e.g., A. R. Gruber et al., 2008, Cell 106(1): 23-24; and PA Carr and GM Church, 2009, Nature Biotechnology 27(12): 1151-62).

In certain embodiments of the invention, the guide RNA or mature crRNA comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of a direct repeat sequence and a guide sequence or spacer sequence. In certain embodiments, the guide RNA or mature crRNA comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of a direct repeat sequence linked to a guide sequence or spacer sequence. In certain embodiments the guide RNA or mature crRNA comprises 19 nts of partial direct repeat followed by 23-25 nt of guide sequence or spacer sequence. In certain embodiments, the effector protein is a Cpf1 effector protein and requires at least 16 nt of guide sequence to achieve detectable DNA cleavage and a minimum of 17 nt of guide sequence to achieve efficient DNA cleavage in vitro. In certain embodiments, the direct repeat sequence is located upstream (i.e., 5) from the guide sequence or spacer sequence. In a preferred embodiment the seed sequence (i.e. the sequence essential critical for recognition and/or hybridization to the sequence at the target locus) of the Cpf1 guide RNA is approximately within the first 5 nt on the 5 end of the guide sequence or spacer sequence. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the mature crRNA comprises a stem loop or an optimized stem loop structure or an optimized secondary structure.

In certain embodiments, the mature crRNA preferably comprises a single stem loop. In certain embodiments, the direct repeat sequence preferably comprises a single stem loop. In certain embodiments, the cleavage activity of the effector protein complex is modified by introducing mutations that affect the stem loop RNA duplex structure. In preferred embodiments, mutations which maintain the RNA duplex of the stem loop may be introduced, whereby the cleavage activity of the effector protein complex is maintained.

In some embodiments, direct repeats may be identified in silico by searching for repetitive motifs that fulfill any or all of the following criteria: 1. found in a 2Kb window of genomic sequence flanking the type II CRISPR locus; 2. span from 20 to 50 bp; and 3. interspaced by 20 to 50 bp. In some embodiments, 2 of these criteria may be used, for instance 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 1 and 3. In some embodiments, all 3 criteria may be used. The \"tracrRNA\" sequence or analogous terms includes any polynucleotide sequence that has sufficient complementarity with a crRNA sequence to hybridize. As indicated herein above, in embodiments of the present invention, the tracrRNA is not required for cleavage activity of Cpf1 effector protein complexes. In some embodiments, it is of interest to reduce the susceptibility of the guide molecule to RNA cleavage, such as to cleavage by Cpf1. Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the guide molecule is adjusted to avoid cleavage by Cpf1 or other RNA-cleaving enzymes. In certain embodiments, the guide molecule comprises non-naturally occurring nucleic acids and/or non-naturally occurring nucleotides and/or nucleotide analogs, and/or chemically modifications. Preferably, these non-naturally occurring nucleic acids and non-naturally occurring nucleotides are located outside the guide sequence. Non-naturally occurring nucleic acids can include, for example, mixtures of naturally and non-naturally occurring nucleotides. Non-naturally occurring nucleotides and/or nucleotide analogs may be modified at the ribose, phosphate, and/or base moiety. In an embodiment of the invention, a guide nucleic acid comprises ribonucleotides and non-ribonucleotides. In one such embodiment, a guide comprises one or more ribonucleotides and one or more deoxyribonucleotides. In an embodiment of the invention, the guide comprises one or more non-naturally occurring nucleotide or nucleotide analog such as a phosphorothioate a locked nucleic acid (LNA) nucleotides comprising a methylene bridge between the 2 and 4 carbons of the ribose ring, or bridged nucleic acids (BNA). Other examples of nucleotides include 2-O-methyl analogs, 2-deoxy analogs, or 2-fluoro analogs. Further examples of modified bases include, but are not limited to, 2-aminopurine, 5-bromo-uridine, pseudouridine, inosine, 7-methylguanosine. Examples of guide RNA chemical modifications include, without limitation, incorporation of 2-O-methyl (M), 2-O-methyl 3phosphorothioate (MS), S-constrained ethyl(cEt), at one or more terminal nucleotides. Such chemically modified guides can comprise increased stability and increased activity as compared to unmodified guides, though on-target vs. off-target specificity is not predictable. (See, Hendel, 2015, Nat Biotechnol. 33(9):985-9, doi: 10.1038/nbt.3290, published al., 0215, PNAS, E7110-E7111; Allerson et al., J. Med. Chem. 2005, 48:901-904; Bramsen et al., Front. Genet., 2012, 3:154; Deng et 2015, 112:11870-11875; Sharma al., al., Nat. Biotechnol. (2015) 33(9): 985-989; Li et al., Nature Biomedical Engineering, 2017, 1, 0066 DOI:10.1038/s41551-017-0066). In some embodiments, the 5 and/or 3 end of a guide RNA is modified by a variety of functional moieties including fluorescent dyes, polyethylene glycol, cholesterol, proteins, or detection tags. (See Kelly et al., 2016, J. Biotech. 233:74-83). In certain embodiments, a guide comprises ribonucleotides in a region that binds to a target RNA and one or more deoxyribonucletides and/or nucleotide analogs in a region that binds to Cpf1. In an embodiment of the invention, deoxyribonucleotides and/or nucleotide analogs are incorporated in engineered guide structures, such as, without limitation, stem-loop regions, and the seed region. For Cpf1 guide, in certain embodiments, the modification is not in the 5-handle of the stem-loop regions. Chemical modification in the 5-handle of the stem-loop region of a guide may abolish its function (see Li, et al., Nature Biomedical Engineering, 2017, 1:0066). In certain embodiments, at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, or 75 nucleotides of a guide is chemically modified. In some embodiments, 3-5 nucleotides at either the 3 or the 5 end of a guide is chemically modified. In some embodiments, only minor modifications are introduced in the seed region, such as 2-F modifications. In some embodiments, 2-F modification is introduced at the 3 end of a guide. In certain embodiments, three to five nucleotides at the 5 and/or the 3 end of the guide are chemically modified with 2-O-methyl (M), 2-O-methyl 3 phosphorothioate (MS), S-constrained ethyl(cEt), thioPACE Such modification can enhance genome editing efficiency (see Hendel et al., Nat. Biotechnol. (2015) 33(9): 985-989). In certain embodiments, all of the phosphodiester bonds of a guide are substituted with phosphorothioates (PS) for enhancing levels of gene disruption. In certain embodiments, more than five nucleotides at the 5 and/or the 3 end of the guide are chemically modified with 2-O-Me, 2-F or S-constrained ethyl(cEt). Such chemically modified guide can mediate enhanced levels of gene disruption (see Ragdarm et al., 0215, PNAS, E7110-E7111). In an embodiment of the invention, a guide is modified to comprise a chemical moiety at its 3 and/or 5 end. Such moieties include, but are not limited to amine, moiety is conjugated to the guide by a linker, such as an alkyl chain. In certain embodiments, the chemical moiety of the modified guide can be used to attach the guide to another molecule, such as DNA, RNA, protein, or nanoparticles. Such chemically modified guide can be used to identify or enrich cells generically edited by a CRISPR system (see Lee et al., eLife, 2017, 6:e25312, DOI:10.7554). In some embodiments, the guide comprises a modified Cpf1 crRNA, having a 5-handle and a guide segment further comprising a seed region and a 3-terminus. In some embodiments, the modified guide can be used with a Cpf1 of any one In some embodiments, the modification to the guide is a chemical modification, an insertion, a deletion or a split. In some embodiments, the chemical modification includes, but is not limited to, incorporation of In some embodiments, the guide comprises one or more of phosphorothioate modifications. In certain embodiments, at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or 25 nucleotides of the guide are chemically modified. In certain embodiments, one or more nucleotides in the seed region are chemically modified. In certain embodiments, one or more nucleotides in the 3-terminus are chemically modified. In certain embodiments, none of the nucleotides in the 5-handle is chemically modified. In some embodiments, the chemical modification in the seed region is a minor modification, such as incorporation of a 2-fluoro analog. In a specific embodiment, one nucleotide of the seed region is replaced with a 2-fluoro analog. In some embodiments, 5 to 10 nucleotides in the 3-terminus are chemically modified. Such chemical modifications at the 3-terminus of the Cpf1 CrRNA may improve Cpf1 activity (see Li, et al., Nature Biomedical Engineering, 2017, 1:0066). In a specific embodiment, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 nucleotides in the 3-terminus are replaced with 2-fluoro analogues. In a specific embodiment, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 nucleotides in the 3-terminus are replaced with 2-O-methyl (M) analogs. In some embodiments, the loop of the 5-handle of the guide is modified. In some embodiments, the loop of the 5-handle of the guide is modified to have a deletion, an insertion, a split, or chemical modifications. In certain embodiments, the modified loop comprises 3, 4, or 5 nucleotides. In certain embodiments, the loop comprises the sequence of UCUU, UUUU, UAUU, or UGUU. In some embodiments, the guide molecule forms a stem loop with a separate non-covalently linked sequence, which can be DNA or RNA. In particular embodiments, the sequences forming the guide are first synthesized using the standard phosphoramidite synthetic protocol (Herdewijn, P., ed., Methods in Molecular Biology Col 288, Oligonucleotide Synthesis: Methods and Applications, Humana Press, New Jersey (2012)). In some embodiments, these sequences can be functionalized to contain an appropriate functional group for ligation using the standard protocol known in the art (Hermanson, G. T., Bioconjugate Techniques, Academic Press (2013)). Examples of functional groups include, but are not limited to, hydroxyl, amine, carboxylic is functionalized, a covalent chemical bond or linkage can be formed between this sequence and the direct repeat sequence. Examples of chemical bonds include, but are not limited to, those based Diels-Alder cyclo-addition pairs or ring-closing metathesis pairs, and Michael reaction pairs. In some embodiments, these stem-loop forming sequences can be chemically synthesized. In some embodiments, the chemical synthesis uses automated, solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis machines with 2-acetoxyethyl orthoester (2-ACE) (Scaringe Am. J. Am. Chem. Soc. (2011) 133: 11540-11546; Hendel et al., Nat. Biotechnol. (2015) 33:985-989). In certain embodiments, the guide molecule (capable of guiding Cpf1 to a target locus) comprises (1) a guide sequence capable of hybridizing to a target locus and (2) a tracr mate or direct repeat sequence whereby the direct repeat sequence is located upstream (i.e., 5) from the guide sequence. In a particular embodiment the seed sequence (i.e. the sequence essential critical for recognition and/or hybridization to the sequence at the target locus) of the Cpf1 guide sequence is approximately within the first 10 nucleotides of the guide sequence. In particular embodiments, the Cpf1 is FnCpf1 and the seed sequence is approximately within the first 5 nt on the 5 end of the guide sequence. In a particular embodiment the guide molecule comprises a guide sequence linked to a direct repeat sequence, wherein the direct repeat sequence comprises one or more stem loops or optimized secondary structures. In particular embodiments, the direct repeat has a minimum length of 16 nts and a single stem loop. In further embodiments the direct repeat has a length longer than 16 nts, preferably more than 17 nts, and has more than one stem loops or optimized secondary structures. In particular embodiments the guide molecule comprises or consists of the guide sequence linked to all or part of the natural direct repeat sequence. A typical Type V Cpf1 guide molecule comprises (in 3 to 5 direction): a guide sequence a first complimentary stretch (the \"repeat\"), a loop (which is typically 4 or 5 nucleotides long), a second complimentary stretch (the \"anti-repeat\" being complimentary to the repeat), and a poly A (often poly U in RNA) tail (terminator). In certain embodiments, the direct repeat sequence retains its natural architecture and forms a single stem loop. In particular embodiments, certain aspects of the guide architecture can be modified, for example by addition, subtraction, or substitution of features, whereas certain other aspects of guide architecture are maintained. Preferred locations for engineered guide molecule modifications, including but not limited to insertions, deletions, and substitutions include guide termini and regions of the guide molecule that are exposed when complexed with the Cpf1 protein and/or target, for example the stemloop of the direct repeat sequence. In particular embodiments, the stem comprises at least about 4 bp comprising complementary X and Y sequences, although stems of more, e.g., 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 or fewer, e.g., 3, 2, base pairs are also contemplated. Thus, for example X2-10 and Y2-10 (wherein X and Y represent any complementary set of nucleotides) may be contemplated. In one aspect, the stem made of the X and Y nucleotides, together with the loop will form a complete hairpin in the overall secondary structure; and, this may be advantageous and the amount of base pairs can be any amount that forms a complete hairpin. In one aspect, any complementary X:Y basepairing sequence (e.g., as to length) is tolerated, so long as the secondary structure of the entire guide molecule is preserved. In one aspect, the loop that connects the stem made of X:Y basepairs can be any sequence of the same length (e.g., 4 or 5 nucleotides) or longer that does not interrupt the overall secondary structure of the guide molecule. In one aspect, the stemloop can further comprise, e.g. an MS2 aptamer. In one aspect, the stem comprises about 5-7 bp comprising complementary X and Y sequences, although stems of more or fewer basepairs are also contemplated. In one aspect, non-Watson Crick basepairing is contemplated, where such pairing otherwise generally preserves the architecture of the stemloop at that position. In particular embodiments the natural hairpin or stemloop structure of the guide molecule is extended or replaced by an extended stemloop. It has been demonstrated that extension of the stem can enhance the assembly of the guide molecule with the CRISPR-Cas protein (Chen et al. Cell. (2013); 155(7): 1479-1491). In particular embodiments the stem of the stemloop is extended by at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more complementary basepairs (i.e. corresponding to the addition of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or more nucleotides in the guide molecule). In particular embodiments these are located at the end of the stem, adjacent to the loop of the stemloop. In particular embodiments, the susceptibility of the guide molecule to RNAses or to decreased expression can be reduced by slight modifications of the sequence of the guide molecule which do not affect its function. For instance, in particular embodiments, premature termination of transcription, such as premature transcription of U6 Pol-III, can be removed by modifying a putative Pol-II terminator (4 consecutive U's) in the guide molecules sequence. Where such sequence modification may be needed in the stemloop of the guide molecule, it is preferably ensured by a basepair flip. In a preferred embodiment the direct repeat may be modified to comprise one or more protein-binding RNA aptamers. In a particular embodiment, one or more aptamers may be included such as part of optimized secondary structure. Such aptamers may be capable of binding a bacteriophage coat protein as detailed further herein. In some embodiments, the guide molecule forms a duplex with a target RNA strand comprising at least one target adenosine residues to be edited. Upon hybridization of the guide RNA molecule to the target RNA strand, the nucleotide deaminase binds to the duplex and catalyzes deamination of one or more target adenosine residues comprised within the RNA-RNA duplex. A guide sequence, and hence a nucleic acid-targeting guide RNA may be selected to target any target nucleic acid sequence. The target sequence may be RNA. The target sequence may be mRNA. In certain embodiments, the target sequence should be associated with a PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) or PFS (protospacer flanking sequence or site); that is, a short sequence recognized by the CRISPR complex. Depending on the nature of the CRISPR-Cas protein, the target sequence should be selected such that its complementary sequence in the RNA duplex (also referred to herein as the non-target sequence) is upstream or downstream of the PAM. In the embodiments of the present invention where the CRISPR-Cas protein is a Cpf1 protein, the complementary sequence of the target sequence in a is downstream or 3 of the PAM. The precise sequence and length requirements for the PAM differ depending on the Cpf1 protein used, but PAMs are typically 2-5 base pair sequences adjacent the protospacer (that is, the target sequence). Examples of the natural PAM sequences for different Cpf1 orthologues are provided herein below and the skilled person will be able to identify further PAM sequences for use with a given Cpf1 protein. Further, engineering of the PAM Interacting (PI) domain may allow programing of PAM specificity, improve target site recognition fidelity, and increase the versatility of the CRISPR-Cas protein, for example as described for Cas9 in Kleinstiver B P et al. Engineered CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases with altered PAM specificities. Nature. 2015 Jul. 23; 523(7561):481-5. doi: 10.1038/nature14592. As further detailed herein, the skilled person will understand that Cpf1 proteins may be modified analogously. In particular embodiments, the guide sequence is selected in order to ensure optimal efficiency of the deaminase on the adenine to be deaminated. The position of the adenine in the target strand relative to the cleavage site of the Cpf1 nickase may be taken into account. In particular embodiments it is of interest to ensure that the nickase will act in the vicinity of the adenine to be deaminated, on the non-target strand. For instance, particular Cpf1 nickase cuts the non-targeting strand 17 nucleotides of the PAM (e.g. AsCpf1, LbCpf1) or 18 nucleotides downstream of the PAM (e.g. FnCpf1), and it can be of interest to design the guide that the cytosine which is to correspond to the adenine to be deaminated is located in the guide sequence within 10 bp upstream or downstream of the nickase cleavage site in the sequence of the corresponding non-target strand.Dead Guide Sequence In one aspect, the invention provides guide sequences which are modified in a manner which allows for formation of the CRISPR complex and successful binding to the target, while at the same time, not allowing for successful nuclease activity (i.e. without nuclease activity/without indel activity). For matters of explanation such modified guide sequences are referred to as \"dead guides\" or \"dead guide sequences\". These dead guides or dead guide sequences can be thought of as catalytically inactive or conformationally inactive with regard to nuclease activity. Nuclease activity may be measured using surveyor analysis or deep sequencing as commonly used in the art, preferably surveyor analysis. Similarly, dead guide sequences may not sufficiently engage in productive base pairing with respect to the ability to promote catalytic activity or to distinguish on-target and off-target binding activity. The ability of a dead guide sequence to direct sequence-specific binding of a CRISPR complex to a target sequence may be assessed by any suitable assay. For example, the components of a CRISPR system sufficient to form a CRISPR complex, including the dead guide sequence to be tested, may be provided to a host cell having the corresponding target sequence, such as by transfection with vectors encoding the components of the CRISPR sequence, followed by an assessment of preferential cleavage within the target sequence, such as by Surveyor assay as described herein. Similarly, cleavage of a target polynucleotide sequence may be evaluated in a test tube by providing the target sequence, components of a CRISPR complex, including the dead guide sequence to be tested and a control guide sequence different from the test dead guide sequence, and comparing binding or rate of cleavage at the target sequence between the test and control guide sequence reactions. Other assays are possible, and will occur to those skilled in the art. A dead guide sequence may be selected to target any target sequence. In some embodiments, the target sequence is a sequence within a genome of a cell. Several structural parameters allow for a proper framework to arrive at such dead guides. As known in the art, one aspect of gRNA-CRISPR effector protein specificity is the direct repeat sequence, which is to be appropriately linked to such guides. In particular, this implies that the direct repeat sequences are designed dependent on the origin of the CRISPR effector protein. Thus, structural data available for validated dead guide sequences may be used for designing Cpf1 specific equivalents. Structural similarity between, e.g., the orthologous nuclease domains RuvC of two or more Cpf1 effector proteins may be used to transfer design equivalent dead guides. In particular embodiments, the dead guide sequences are shorter than respective guide sequences which result in active Cpf1-specific indel formation. Dead guides are 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, shorter than respective guides directed to the same Cpf1 leading to active Cpf1-specific indel formation. The use of dead guides in the context herein as well as the state of the art provides a surprising and unexpected platform for network biology and/or systems biology in both in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo applications, allowing for multiplex gene targeting, and in particular bidirectional multiplex gene targeting. Prior to the use of dead guides, addressing multiple targets, for example for activation, repression and/or silencing of gene activity, has been challenging and in some cases not possible. With the use of dead guides, multiple targets, and thus multiple activities, may be addressed, for example, in the same cell, in the same animal, or in the same patient. Such multiplexing may occur at the same time or staggered for a desired timeframe. For example, the dead guides now allow for the first time to use gRNA as a means for gene targeting, without the consequence of nuclease activity, while at the same time providing directed means for activation or repression. Guide RNA comprising a dead guide may be modified to further include elements in a manner which allow for activation or repression of gene activity, in particular protein adaptors (e.g. aptamers) as described herein elsewhere allowing for functional placement of gene effectors (e.g. activators or repressors of gene activity). One example is the incorporation of aptamers, as explained herein and in the state of the art. By engineering the gRNA comprising a dead guide to incorporate protein-interacting aptamers (Konermann et al., \"Genome-scale transcription activation by an engineered CRISPR-Cas9 complex,\" doi:10.1038/nature14136, incorporated herein by reference), one may assemble a synthetic transcription activation complex consisting of multiple distinct effector domains. Such may be modeled after natural transcription activation processes. For example, an aptamer, which selectively binds an effector (e.g. an activator or repressor; dimerized MS2 bacteriophage coat proteins as fusion proteins with an activator or repressor), or a protein which itself binds an effector (e.g. activator or repressor) may be appended to a dead gRNA tetraloop and/or a stem-loop 2. In the case of MS2, the fusion protein MS2-VP64 binds to the tetraloop and/or stem-loop 2 and in turn mediates transcriptional up-regulation, for example for Neurog2. Other for example, VP64. P65, HSF1, and MyoD1. By mere example of this concept, replacement of the MS2 stem-loops with PP7-interacting stem-loops may be used to recruit repressive elements. Accordingly, in particular embodiments of the methods provided herein, use is made of a dead guide, wherein the gRNA further comprises modifications which provide for gene activation or repression, as described herein. The dead gRNA may comprise one or more aptamers. The aptamers may be specific to gene effectors, gene activators or gene repressors. Alternatively, the aptamers may be specific to a protein which in turn is specific to and recruits/binds a specific gene effector, gene activator or gene repressor. If there are multiple sites for activator or repressor recruitment, it is preferred that the sites are specific to either activators or repressors. If there are multiple sites for activator or repressor binding, the sites may be specific to the same activators or same repressors. The sites may also be specific to different activators or different repressors. The gene effectors, gene activators, gene repressors may be present in the form of fusion proteins. In particular embodiments, the dead gRNA includes a non-naturally occurring or engineered composition comprising two or more adaptor proteins, wherein each protein is associated with one or more functional domains and wherein the adaptor protein binds to the distinct RNA sequence(s) inserted into the at least one loop of the dead gRNA. In certain embodiments, the adaptor protein is a fusion protein comprising the functional domain, the fusion protein optionally comprising a linker between the adaptor protein and the functional domain, the linker optionally including a GlySer linker. In certain embodiments, the one or more functional domains associated with the adaptor protein are selected from: transcriptional activation domains and transcriptional repressor domains. In certain embodiments, the one or more functional domains associated with the adaptor protein are selected from: VP64, p65, MyoD1, HSF1, RTA or SET7/9, KRAB domain, NcoR domain, SID domain or a SID4X domain. In certain embodiments, at least one of the one or more functional domains associated with the adaptor protein have one or more activities comprising methylase activity, demethylase activity, transcription activation activity, transcription repression activity, transcription release factor activity, histone modification activity, DNA integration activity RNA cleavage activity, DNA cleavage activity or nucleic acid binding activity. In certain embodiments, the DNA cleavage activity is due to a Fok1 nuclease. In certain embodiments, the dead gRNA is modified so that, after dead gRNA binds the adaptor protein and further binds to the Cpf1 and target, the functional domain is in a spatial orientation allowing for the functional domain to function in its attributed function. In certain embodiments, the at least one loop of the dead gRNA is tetra loop and/or loop2. In certain embodiments, the tetra loop and loop 2 of the dead gRNA are modified by the insertion of the distinct RNA sequence(s). In certain embodiments, the insertion of distinct RNA sequence(s) that bind to one or more adaptor proteins is an aptamer sequence. In certain embodiments, the aptamer sequence is two or more aptamer sequences specific to the same adaptor protein. In certain embodiments, the aptamer sequence is two or more aptamer sequences specific to different adaptor protein. In certain embodiments, the adaptor protein comprises MS2, first adaptor protein is associated with a p65 domain and a second adaptor protein is associated with a HSF1 domain. In certain embodiments, the composition comprises a Cpf1 CRISPR-Cas complex having at least three functional domains, at least one of which is associated with the Cpf1 and at least two of which are associated with dead gRNA. The use of two different aptamers (each associated with a distinct nucleic acid-targeting guide RNAs) allows an activator-adaptor protein fusion and a repressor-adaptor protein fusion to be used, with different nucleic acid-targeting guide RNAs, to activate expression of one DNA or RNA, whilst repressing another. They, along with their different guide RNAs can be administered together, or substantially together, in a multiplexed approach. A large number of such modified nucleic acid-targeting guide RNAs can be used all at the same time, for example 10 or 20 or 30 and so forth, whilst only one (or at least a minimal number) of effector protein molecules need to be delivered, as a comparatively small number of effector protein molecules can be used with a large number modified guides. The adaptor protein may be associated (preferably linked or fused to) one or more activators or one or more repressors. For example, the adaptor protein may be associated with a first activator and a second activator. The first and second activators may be the same, but they are preferably different activators. Three or more or even four or more activators (or repressors) may be used, but package size may limit the number being higher than 5 different functional domains. Linkers are preferably used, over a direct fusion to the adaptor protein, where two or more functional domains are associated with the adaptor protein. Suitable linkers might include the GlySer linker. It is also envisaged that the nucleic acid-targeting effector protein-guide RNA complex as a whole may be associated with two or more functional domains. For example, there may be two or more functional domains associated with the nucleic acid-targeting effector protein, or there may be two or more functional domains associated with the guide RNA (via one or more adaptor proteins), or there may be one or more functional domains associated with the nucleic acid-targeting effector protein and one or more functional domains associated with the guide RNA (via one or more adaptor proteins). The fusion between the adaptor protein and the activator or repressor may include a linker. For example, GlySer linkers GGGS (SEQ ID NO: 12) can be used. They can be used in repeats of 3 ((GGGGS)3 (SEQ ID NO: 1)) or 6 (SEQ ID NO: 9 (SEQ ID NO: 3) or even 12 (SEQ ID NO: 4) or more, to provide suitable lengths, as required. Linkers can be used between the guide RNAs and the functional domain (activator or repressor), or between the nucleic acid-targeting Cas protein (Cas) and the functional domain (activator or repressor). The linkers the user to engineer appropriate amounts of \"mechanical flexibility\". The invention comprehends a nucleic acid-targeting complex comprising a nucleic acid-targeting effector and a guide RNA, wherein the nucleic acid-targeting effector protein comprises at least one mutation, such that the nucleic acid-targeting effector protein has no more than 5% of the activity of the nucleic acid-targeting effector protein not having the at least one mutation and, optional, at least one or more nuclear localization sequences; the guide RNA comprises a guide sequence capable of hybridizing to a target sequence in a RNA of interest in a cell; and wherein: the nucleic acid-targeting effector protein is associated with two or more functional domains; or at least one loop of the guide RNA is modified by the insertion of distinct RNA sequence(s) that bind to one or more adaptor proteins, and wherein the adaptor protein is associated with two or more functional domains; or the nucleic acid-targeting Cas protein is associated with one or more functional domains and at least one loop of the guide RNA is modified by the insertion of distinct RNA sequence(s) that bind to one or more adaptor proteins, and wherein the adaptor protein is associated with one or more functional domains. In certain embodiments, the methods may involve the use of a second gRNA, wherein the second gRNA is a live gRNA capable of hybridizing to a second target sequence such that a second Cpf1 CRISPR-Cas system is directed to a second genomic locus of interest in a cell with detectable indel activity at the second genomic locus resultant from nuclease activity of the Cpf1 enzyme of the system. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the methods involve a plurality of dead gRNAs and/or a plurality of live gRNAs. Methods for designing, evaluating, or selecting a dead guide RNA targeting sequence (dead guide sequence) for guiding a Cpf1 CRISPR-Cas system to a target gene locus are described e.g. in WO2016094872, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In particular embodiments, the method of selecting a dead guide RNA targeting sequence for directing a functionalized Cpf1 to a gene locus in an organism, without cleavage, comprises a) locating one or more CRISPR motifs in the gene locus; b) analyzing the sequence downstream of each CRISPR motif by i) selecting 10 to 15 nt adjacent to the CRISPR motif, ii) determining the GC content of the sequence, and c) selecting the 10 to 15 nt sequence as a targeting sequence for use in a dead guide RNA if the GC content of the sequence is 30% more, 40% or more. In certain embodiments, the GC content of the targeting sequence is 35% or more, 40% or more, 45% or more, 50% or more, 55% or more, 60% or more, 65% or more, or 70% or more. In certain embodiments, the GC content of the targeting sequence is from 30% to 40% or from 40% to 50% or from 50% to 60% or from 60% to 70%. In an embodiment of the invention, two or more sequences in a gene locus are analyzed and the sequence having the highest GC content is selected. In an embodiment, the portion of the targeting sequence in which GC content is evaluated is 10 to 15 contiguous nucleotides of the 15 target nucleotides nearest to the PAM. In an embodiment of the invention, the portion of the guide in which GC content is considered is the 10 to 11 nucleotides or 11 to 12 nucleotides or 12 to 13 nucleotides or 13, or 14, or 15 contiguous nucleotides of the 15 nucleotides nearest to the PAM. It has been observed that increased GC content in dead guide RNAs of 16 to 20 nucleotides coincides with increased DNA cleavage and reduced functional activation. It has been demonstrated herein that efficiency of functionalized Cpf1 can be increased by addition of nucleotides to the 3 end of a guide RNA which do not match a target sequence downstream of the CRISPR motif. For example, of dead guide RNA 11 to 15 nt in length, shorter guides may be less likely to promote target cleavage, but are also less efficient at promoting CRISPR system binding and functional control. It is believed that similar effects can be observed for Cpf1.CPF1 Collateral Activity The programmability, specificity, and collateral activity of the RNA-guided Cpf1 also make it an ideal switchable nuclease for cleavage of nucleic acids. In one embodiment, a Cpf1 system is engineered to provide and take advantage of collateral non-specific cleavage of RNA. In another embodiment, a Cpf1 system is engineered to provide and take advantage of collateral non-specific cleavage of ssDNA. Accordingly, engineered Cpf1 systems provide platforms for nucleic acid detection and transcriptome manipulation, and inducing cell death. Cpf1 is developed for use as a mammalian transcript knockdown and binding tool. Cpf1 is capable of robust collateral cleavage of RNA and ssDNA when activated by sequence-specific targeted DNA binding. In certain embodiments, Cpf1 is provided or expressed in an in vitro system or in a cell, transiently or stably, and targeted or triggered to non-specifically cleave cellular nucleic acids. In one embodiment, Cpf1 is engineered to knock down ssDNA, for example viral ssDNA. In another embodiment, Cpf1 is engineered to knock down RNA. The system can be devised such that the knockdown is dependent on a target DNA present in the cell or in vitro system, or triggered by the addition of a target nucleic acid to the system or cell. In an embodiment, the Cpf1 system is engineered to non-specifically cleave RNA in a subset of cells distinguishable by the presence of an aberrant DNA sequence, for instance where cleavage of the aberrant DNA might be incomplete or ineffectual. In one non-limiting example, a DNA translocation that is present in a cancer cell and drives cell transformation is targeted. Whereas a subpopulation of cells that undergoes chromosomal DNA and repair may survive, non-specific collateral ribonuclease activity advantageously leads to cell death of potential survivors. Collateral activity was recently leveraged for a highly sensitive and specific nucleic acid detection platform termed SHERLOCK that is useful for many clinical diagnoses (Gootenberg, J. S. et al. Nucleic acid detection with CRISPR-Cas13a/C2c2. Science 356, 438-442 (2017)). According to the invention, engineered Cpf1 systems are optimized for DNA or RNA endonuclease activity and can be expressed in mammalian cells and targeted to effectively knock down reporter molecules or transcripts in cells. The collateral effect of engineered Cpf1 with isothermal amplification provides a CRISPR-based diagnostic providing rapid DNA or RNA detection with high sensitivity and single-base mismatch specificity. The Cpf1-based molecular detection platform is used to detect specific strains of virus, distinguish pathogenic bacteria, genotype human DNA, and identify cell-free tumor DNA mutations. Furthermore, reaction reagents can be lyophilized for cold-chain independence and long-term storage, and readily reconstituted on paper for field applications. The ability to rapidly detect nucleic acids with high sensitivity and single-base specificity on a portable platform may aid in disease diagnosis and monitoring, epidemiology, and general laboratory tasks. Although methods exist for detecting nucleic acids, they have trade-offs among sensitivity, specificity, simplicity, cost, and speed. Microbial Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (CRISPR-Cas) adaptive immune systems contain programmable endonucleases that can be leveraged for CRISPR-based diagnostics (CRISPR-Dx). Cpf1, can be reprogrammed with CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to provide a platform for specific DNA sensing. Upon recognition of its DNA target, activated Cpf1 engages in \"collateral\" cleavage of nearby non-targeted nucleic acids (i.e., RNA and/or ssDNA). This crRNA-programmed collateral cleavage activity allows Cpf1 to detect the presence of a specific DNA in vivo by triggering programmed cell death or by nonspecific degradation of labeled RNA or ssDNA. Here is described an in vitro nucleic acid detection platform with high sensitivity based on nucleic acid amplification and Cpf1-mediated collateral cleavage of a commercial reporter RNA, allowing for real-time detection of the target.RNA-Based and DNA-Based Masking Constructs As used herein, a \"masking construct\" refers to a molecule that can be cleaved or otherwise deactivated by an activated CRISPR system effector protein described herein. The term \"masking construct\" may also be referred to in the alternative as a \"detection construct.\" Depending on the nuclease activity of the CRISPR effector protein, the masking construct may be a RNA-based or a DNA-based masking construct. The Nucleic Acid-based masking constructs comprises a acid element that is cleavable by a CRISPR effector protein. Cleavage of the nucleic acid element releases agents or produces conformational changes that allow a detectable signal to be produced. Example constructs demonstrating how the nucleic acid element may be used to prevent or mask generation of detectable signal are described below and embodiments of the invention comprise variants of the same. Prior to cleavage, or when the masking construct is in an 'active' state, the masking construct blocks the generation or detection of a positive detectable signal. It will be understood that in certain example embodiments a minimal background signal may be produced in the presence of an active masking construct. A positive detectable signal may be any signal that can be detected using optical, fluorescent, chemiluminescent, electrochemical or other detection methods known in the art. The term \"positive detectable signal\" is used to differentiate from other detectable signals that may be detectable in the presence of the masking construct. For example, in certain embodiments a first signal may be detected when the masking agent is present (i.e. a negative detectable signal), which then converts to a second signal (e.g. the positive detectable signal) upon detection of the target molecules and cleavage or deactivation of the masking agent by the activated CRISPR effector protein. In certain example embodiments, the masking construct may suppress generation of a gene product. The gene product may be encoded by a reporter construct that is added to the sample. The masking construct may be an interfering RNA involved in a RNA interference pathway, such as a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or small interfering RNA (siRNA). The masking construct may also comprise microRNA (miRNA). While present, the masking construct suppresses expression of the gene product. The gene product may be a fluorescent protein or other RNA transcript or proteins that would otherwise be detectable by a labeled probe, aptamer, or antibody but for the presence of the masking construct. Upon activation of the effector protein the masking construct is cleaved or otherwise silenced allowing for expression and detection of the gene product as the positive detectable signal. In certain example embodiments, the masking construct may sequester one or more reagents needed to generate a detectable positive signal such that release of the one or more reagents from the masking construct results in generation of the detectable positive signal. The one or more reagents may combine to produce a colorimetric signal, a chemiluminescent signal, a fluorescent signal, or any other detectable signal and may comprise any reagents known to be suitable for such purposes. In certain example embodiments, the one or more reagents are sequestered by RNA aptamers that bind the one or more reagents. The one or more reagents are released when the effector protein is activated upon detection of a target molecule and the RNA or DNA aptamers are degraded. In certain example embodiments, the masking construct may be immobilized on a solid substrate in an individual discrete volume (defined further below) and sequesters a single reagent. For example, the reagent may be a bead comprising a dye. When sequestered by the immobilized reagent, the individual beads are too diffuse to generate a detectable signal, but upon release from the masking construct are able to generate a detectable signal, for example by aggregation or simple increase in solution concentration. In certain example embodiments, the immobilized masking agent is a RNA- or DNA-based aptamer that can be cleaved by the activated effector protein upon detection of a target molecule. In certain other example embodiments, the masking construct binds to an immobilized reagent in solution thereby blocking the ability of the reagent to bind to a separate labeled binding partner that is free in solution. Thus, upon application of a washing step to a sample, the labeled binding partner can be washed out of the sample in the absence of a target molecule. However, if the effector protein is activated, the masking construct is cleaved to a degree sufficient to interfere with the ability of the masking construct to bind the reagent thereby allowing the labeled binding partner to bind to the immobilized reagent. Thus, the labeled binding partner remains after the wash step indicating the presence of the target molecule in the sample. In certain aspects, the masking construct that binds the immobilized reagent is a DNA or RNA aptamer. The immobilized reagent may be a protein and the labeled minding partner may be a labeled antibody. Alternatively, the immobilized reagent may be streptavidin and the labeled binding partner may be labeled biotin. The label on the binding partner used in the above embodiments may be any detectable label known in the art. In addition, other known binding partners may be used in accordance with the overall design described herein. In certain example embodiments, the masking construct may comprise a ribozyme. Ribozymes are RNA molecules having catalytic properties. Ribozymes, both naturally and engineered, comprise or consist of RNA that may be targeted by the effector proteins disclosed herein. The ribozyme may be selected or engineered to catalyze a reaction that either generates a negative detectable signal or prevents generation of a positive control signal. Upon deactivation of the ribozyme by the activated effector protein the reaction generating a negative control signal, or preventing generation of a positive detectable signal, is removed thereby allowing a positive detectable signal to be generated. In one example embodiment, the ribozyme may catalyze a colorimetric reaction causing a solution to appear as a first color. When the ribozyme is deactivated the solution then turns to a second color, the second color being the detectable positive signal. An example of how ribozymes can be used to catalyze a colorimetric reaction are described in Zhao et al. 16:337-42, and provide an example of how such a system could be modified to work in the context of the embodiments disclosed herein. Alternatively, ribozymes, when present can generate cleavage products of, for example, RNA transcripts. Thus, detection of a positive detectable signal may comprise detection of non-cleaved RNA transcripts that are only generated in the absence of the ribozyme. In certain example embodiments, the one or more reagents is a protein, such as an enzyme, capable of facilitating generation of a detectable signal, such as a colorimetric, chemiluminescent, or fluorescent signal, that is inhibited or sequestered such that the protein cannot generate the detectable signal by the binding of one or more DNA or RNA aptamers to the protein. Upon activation of the effector proteins disclosed herein, the DNA or RNA aptamers are cleaved or degraded to an extent that they no longer inhibit the protein's ability to generate the detectable signal. In certain example embodiments, the aptamer is a thrombin a sequence of 5). When this aptamer is cleaved, thrombin will become active and will cleave a peptide colorimetric or fluorescent substrate. In certain example embodiments, the substrate is para-nitroanilide (pNA) covalently linked for thrombin. Upon cleavage by thrombin, pNA is released and becomes yellow in color and easily visible to the eye. In certain example embodiments, the fluorescent substrate is 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin a blue fluorophore that can be detected using a fluorescence detector. Inhibitory aptamers may also be (HRP), beta-galactosidase, or calf alkaline phosphatase (CAP) and within the general principals laid out above. In certain embodiments, RNAse or DNAse activity is detected colorimetrically via cleavage of enzyme-inhibiting aptamers. One potential mode of converting DNAse or RNAse activity into a colorimetric signal is to couple the cleavage of a DNA or RNA aptamer with the re-activation of an enzyme that is capable of producing a colorimetric output. In the absence of RNA or DNA cleavage, the intact aptamer will bind to the enzyme target and inhibit its activity. The advantage of this readout system is that the enzyme provides an additional amplification step: once liberated from an aptamer via collateral activity (e.g. Cpf1 collateral activity), the colorimetric enzyme will continue to produce colorimetric product, leading to a multiplication of signal. In certain embodiments, an existing aptamer that inhibits an enzyme with a colorimetric readout is used. Several aptamer/enzyme pairs with colorimetric readouts such as thrombin, These proteases have colorimetric substrates based upon pNA and are commercially available. In certain embodiments, a novel aptamer targeting a common colorimetric enzyme is used. Common and robust enzymes, such as beta-galactosidase, horseradish peroxidase, or calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, could be targeted by engineered aptamers designed by selection strategies such as SELEX. Such strategies allow for quick selection of aptamers with nanomolar binding efficiencies and could be used for the development of additional enzyme/aptamer pairs for colorimetric readout. In certain embodiments, RNAse activity is colorimetrically via cleavage of RNA-tethered inhibitors. Many common colorimetric enzymes have competitive, reversible inhibitors: for example, beta-galactosidase can be inhibited by galactose. Many of these inhibitors are weak, but their effect can be increased by increases in local concentration. By linking local concentration of inhibitors to DNase RNAse activity, colorimetric enzyme and inhibitor pairs can DNase and RNAse sensors. The colorimetric DNase or RNAse sensor upon inhibitors involves three components: the colorimetric enzyme, the inhibitor, and a bridging RNA or DNA that is covalently linked to both the inhibitor and enzyme, tethering the inhibitor to the enzyme. In the uncleaved configuration, the enzyme is inhibited by the increased local concentration of the small molecule; when the DNA or RNA is cleaved (e.g. by Cas13 or Cas12 collateral cleavage), the inhibitor will be released and the colorimetric enzyme will be activated. In certain embodiments, RNAse activity is detected colorimetrically via formation and/or activation of G-quadruplexes. G quadraplexes in DNA can complex with heme (iron (III)-protoporphyrin IX) to form a DNAzyme with peroxidase activity. When supplied with a peroxidase substrate (e.g. ABTS: (2,2-Azinobis [3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid]-diammonium salt)), the G-quadraplex-heme complex in the presence of hydrogen peroxide causes oxidation of the substrate, which then forms a green color in solution. An example G-quadraplex forming DNA sequence is: GGGTAGGGCGGGTTGGGA (SEQ ID NO: 6). By hybridizing an additional DNA or RNA sequence, referred to herein as a \"staple,\" to this DNA aptamer, formation of the G-quadraplex structure will be limited. Upon collateral activation, the staple will be cleaved allowing the G quadraplex to form and heme to bind. This strategy is particularly appealing because color formation is enzymatic, meaning there is additional amplification beyond collateral activation. In certain example embodiments, the masking construct may be immobilized on a solid substrate in an individual discrete volume (defined further below) and sequesters a single reagent. For example, the reagent may be a bead comprising a dye. When sequestered by the immobilized reagent, the individual beads are too diffuse to generate a detectable signal, but upon release from the masking construct are able to generate a detectable signal, for example by aggregation or simple increase in solution concentration. In certain example embodiments, the immobilized masking agent is a DNA- or RNA-based aptamer that can be cleaved by the activated effector protein upon detection of a target molecule. In one example embodiment, the masking construct comprises a detection agent that changes color depending on whether the detection agent is aggregated or dispersed in solution. For example, certain nanoparticles, such as colloidal gold, undergo a visible purple to red color shift as they move from aggregates to dispersed particles. Accordingly, in certain example embodiments, such detection agents may be held in aggregate by one or more bridge molecules. At least a portion of the bridge molecule comprises RNA or DNA. Upon activation of the effector proteins disclosed herein, the RNA or DNA portion of the bridge molecule is cleaved allowing the detection agent to disperse and resulting in the corresponding change in color. In certain example embodiments, the detection agent is a colloidal metal. The colloidal metal material may include water-insoluble metal particles or metallic compounds dispersed in a liquid, a hydrosol, or a metal sol. The colloidal metal may be selected from the metals in groups IA, IB, IIB and IIIB of the periodic table, as well as the transition metals, especially those of group VIII. Preferred metals include gold, silver, aluminum, ruthenium, zinc, iron, nickel and calcium. Other suitable metals also include the following in all of their various oxidation states: lithium, sodium, magnesium, potassium, rhenium, gadolinium. The metals are preferably provided in ionic form, derived from an appropriate metal compound, for example the A13+, Ru3+, Zn2+, Fe3+, Ni2+ and Ca2+ ions. When the RNA or DNA bridge is cut by the activated CRISPR effector, the aforementioned color shift is observed. In certain example embodiments the particles are colloidal metals. In certain other example embodiments, the colloidal metal is a colloidal gold. In certain example embodiments, the colloidal nanoparticles are 15 nm gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Due to unique surface properties of colloidal gold nanoparticles, maximal absorbance is observed at 520 nm when fully dispersed in solution and appear red in color to the naked eye. Upon aggregation of AuNPs, they exhibit a red-shift in maximal absorbance and appear darker in color, eventually precipitating from solution as a dark purple aggregate. In certain example embodiments the nanoparticles are modified to include DNA linkers extending from the surface of the nanoparticle. Individual particles are linked together by single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) or single-stranded DNA bridges that hybridize on each end to at least a portion of the DNA linkers. Thus, the nanoparticles will form a web of linked particles and aggregate, appearing as a dark precipitate. Upon activation of the CRISPR effectors disclosed herein, the ssRNA or ssDNA bridge will be cleaved, releasing the AU NPS from the linked mesh and producing a visible red color. Example DNA linkers and bridge sequences are listed below. Thiol linkers on the end of the DNA linkers may be used for surface conjugation to the AuNPS. Other forms of conjugation may be used. In certain example embodiments, two populations of AuNPs may be generated, one for each DNA linker. This will help facilitate proper binding of the ssRNA bridge with proper orientation. In certain example embodiments, a first DNA linker is conjugated by the 3 end while a second DNA linker is conjugated by the 5 end. In certain other example embodiments, the masking construct may comprise an RNA or DNA oligonucleotide to which are attached a detectable label and a masking agent of that detectable label. An example of such a detectable label/masking agent pair is a fluorophore and a quencher of the fluorophore. Quenching of the fluorophore can occur as a result of the formation of a non-fluorescent complex between the fluorophore and another fluorophore or non-fluorescent molecule. This mechanism is known as ground-state complex formation, static quenching, or contact quenching. Accordingly, the RNA or DNA oligonucleotide may be designed so that the fluorophore and quencher are in sufficient proximity for contact quenching to occur. Fluorophores and their cognate quenchers are known in the art and can be selected for this purpose by one having ordinary skill in the art. The particular fluorophore/quencher pair is not critical in the context of this invention, only that selection of the fluorophore/quencher pairs ensures masking of the fluorophore. Upon activation of the effector proteins disclosed herein, the RNA or DNA oligonucleotide is cleaved thereby severing the proximity between the fluorophore and quencher needed to maintain the contact quenching effect. Accordingly, detection of the fluorophore may be used to determine the presence of a target molecule in a sample. In certain other example embodiments, the masking construct may comprise one or more RNA oligonucleotides to which are attached one or more metal nanoparticles, such as gold nanoparticles. In some embodiments, the masking construct comprises a plurality of metal nanoparticles crosslinked by a plurality of RNA or DNA oligonucleotides forming a closed loop. In one embodiment, the masking construct comprises three gold nanoparticles crosslinked by three RNA or DNA oligonucleotides forming a closed loop. In some embodiments, the cleavage of the RNA or DNA oligonucleotides by the CRISPR effector protein leads to a detectable signal produced by the metal nanoparticles. In certain other example embodiments, the masking construct may comprise one or more RNA or DNA oligonucleotides to which are attached one or more quantum dots. In some embodiments, the cleavage of the RNA or DNA oligonucleotides by the CRISPR effector protein leads to a detectable signal produced by the quantum dots. In one example embodiment, the masking construct may comprise a quantum dot. The quantum dot may have multiple linker molecules attached to the surface. At least a portion of the linker molecule comprises RNA or DNA. The linker molecule is attached to the quantum dot at one end and to one or more quenchers along the length or at terminal ends of the linker such that the quenchers are maintained in sufficient proximity for quenching of the quantum dot to occur. The linker may be branched. As above, the quantum dot/quencher pair is not critical, only that selection of the quantum dot/quencher pair ensures masking of the fluorophore. Quantum dots and their cognate quenchers are known in the art and can be selected for this purpose by one having ordinary skill in the art. Upon activation of the effector proteins disclosed herein, the RNA or DNA portion of the linker molecule is cleaved thereby eliminating the proximity between the quantum dot and one or more quenchers needed to maintain the quenching effect. In certain example embodiments the quantum dot is streptavidin conjugated. RNA or DNA are attached via biotin linkers and recruit quenching molecules with 10) /5Biosg/ is a biotin tag and/31AbRQSp/ is an Iowa black quencher. Upon cleavage, by the activated effectors disclosed herein the quantum dot will fluoresce visibly. In a similar fashion, fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) may be used to generate a detectable positive signal. FRET is a non-radiative process by which a photon from an energetically excited fluorophore (i.e. \"donor fluorophore\") raises the energy state of an electron in another molecule (i.e. \"the acceptor\") to higher vibrational levels of the excited singlet state. The donor fluorophore returns to the ground state without emitting a fluoresce characteristic of that fluorophore. The acceptor can be another fluorophore or non-fluorescent molecule. If the acceptor is a fluorophore, the transferred energy is emitted as fluorescence characteristic of that fluorophore. If the acceptor is a non-fluorescent molecule the absorbed energy is loss as heat. Thus, in the context of the embodiments disclosed herein, the fluorophore/quencher pair is replaced with a donor fluorophore/acceptor pair attached to the oligonucleotide molecule. When intact, the masking construct generates a first signal (negative detectable signal) as detected by the fluorescence or heat emitted from the acceptor. Upon activation of the effector proteins disclosed herein the RNA oligonucleotide is cleaved and FRET is disrupted such that fluorescence of the donor fluorophore is now detected (positive detectable signal). In certain example embodiments, the masking construct comprises the use of intercalating dyes which change their absorbance in response to cleavage of long RNAs or DNAs to short nucleotides. Several such dyes exist. For example, pyronine-Y will complex with RNA and form a complex that has an absorbance at 572 nm. Cleavage of the RNA results in loss of absorbance and a color change. Methylene blue may be used in a similar fashion, with changes in absorbance at 688 nm upon RNA cleavage. Accordingly, in certain example embodiments the masking construct comprises a RNA and intercalating dye complex that changes absorbance upon the cleavage of RNA by the effector proteins disclosed herein. In certain example embodiments, the masking construct may comprise an initiator for an HCR reaction. See e.g. Dirks and Pierce. PNAS 101, 15275-15728 (2004). HCR reactions utilize the potential energy in two hairpin species. When a single-stranded initiator having a portion of complementary to a corresponding region on one of the hairpins is released into the previously stable mixture, it opens a hairpin of one speces. This process, in turn, exposes a single-stranded region that opens a hairpin of the other species. This process, in turn, exposes a single stranded region identical to the original initiator. The resulting chain reaction may lead to the formation of a nicked double helix that grows until the hairpin supply is exhausted. Detection of the resulting products may be done on a gel or colorimetrically. Example colorimetric detection methods include, for example, those disclosed in Lu et al. \"Ultra-sensitive colorimetric assay system based on the reaction amplification and split aptamers\" Analyst 2015, 150, 7657-7662, and Song et al. \"Non covalent fluorescent labeling of hairpin DNA probe coupled with hybridization chain reaction for sensitive DNA detection.\" Applied Spectroscopy, 70(4): 686-694 (2016). In certain example embodiments, the masking construct may comprise a HCR initiator sequence and a cleavable structural element, such as a loop or hairpin, that prevents the initiator from initiating the HCR reaction. Upon cleavage of the structure element by an activated CRISPR effector protein, the initiator is then released to trigger the HCR reaction, detection thereof indicating the presence of one or more targets in the sample. In certain example embodiments, the masking construct comprises a hairpin with a RNA loop. When an activated CRISRP effector protein cuts the RNA loop, the initiator can be released to trigger the HCR reaction.Amplification of Target In certain example embodiments, target RNAs and/or DNAs may be amplified prior to activating the CRISPR effector protein. Any suitable RNA or DNA amplification technique may be used. In certain example embodiments, the RNA or DNA amplification is an isothermal amplification. In certain example embodiments, non-isothermal amplification methods may be used which include, but are not limited to, PCR, multiple displacement amplification (MDA), rolling circle amplification (RCA), ligase chain reaction (LCR), or ramification amplification method (RAM). In certain example embodiments, the RNA or DNA amplification is NASBA, which is initiated with reverse transcription of target RNA by a sequence-specific reverse primer to create a RNA/DNA duplex. RNase H is then used to degrade the RNA template, allowing a forward primer containing a promoter, such as the T7 promoter, to bind and initiate elongation of the complementary strand, generating a double-stranded DNA product. The RNA polymerase promoter-mediated transcription of the DNA template then creates copies of the target RNA sequence. Importantly, each of the new target RNAs can be detected by the guide RNAs thus further enhancing the sensitivity of the assay. Binding of the target RNAs by the guide RNAs then leads to activation of the CRISPR effector protein and the methods proceed as outlined above. The NASBA reaction has the additional advantage of being able to proceed under moderate isothermal conditions, for example at approximately 41\u00b0 C., making it suitable for systems and devices deployed for early and direct detection in the field and far from clinical laboratories. In certain other example embodiments, a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) reaction may be used to amplify the target nucleic acids. RPA reactions employ recombinases which are capable of pairing sequence-specific primers with homologous sequence in duplex DNA. If target DNA is present, DNA amplification is initiated and no other sample manipulation such as thermal cycling or chemical melting may be needed. The entire RPA amplification system is stable as a dried formulation and can be transported safely without refrigeration. RPA reactions may also be carried out at isothermal temperatures with an optimum reaction temperature of 37-42\u00b0 C. The sequence specific primers are designed to amplify a sequence comprising the target nucleic acid sequence to be detected. In certain example embodiments, a RNA polymerase promoter, such as a T7 promoter, is added to one of the primers. This results in an amplified double-stranded DNA product comprising the target sequence and a RNA polymerase promoter. After, or during, the RPA reaction, a RNA polymerase is added that will produce RNA from the double-stranded DNA templates. The amplified target RNA can then in turn be detected by the CRISPR effector system. In this way target DNA can be detected using the embodiments disclosed herein. RPA reactions can also be used to amplify target RNA. The target RNA is first converted to cDNA using a reverse transcriptase, followed by second strand DNA synthesis, at which point the RPA reaction proceeds as outlined above. Accordingly, in certain example embodiments the systems disclosed herein may include amplification reagents. Different components or reagents useful for amplification of nucleic acids are described herein. For example, an amplification reagent as described herein may include a buffer, such as a Tris buffer. A Tris buffer may be used at any concentration appropriate for the desired application or use, for example including, but not limited to, a concentration of 1 mM, 2 mM, 3 mM, 4 mM, 5 mM, 6 mM, 7 mM, 8 mM, 9 mM, 10 mM, 11 mM, 12 mM, 13 mM, 14 mM, 15 mM, 25 mM, 50 mM, 75 mM, 1 M, or the like. One of skill in the art will be able to determine an appropriate concentration of a buffer such as Tris for use with the present invention. A salt, such as magnesium chloride (MgCl2), potassium chloride (KCl), or sodium chloride (NaCl), be included in an amplification reaction, such as PCR, in order to improve the amplification of nucleic acid fragments. Although the salt concentration will depend on the particular reaction and application, in some embodiments, nucleic acid fragments of a particular size may produce optimum results at particular salt concentrations. Larger products may need altered salt concentrations, typically lower salt, in order to produce desired results, while amplification of smaller products may produce better results at higher salt concentrations. One of skill in the art will understand that the presence and/or concentration of a salt, along with alteration of salt concentrations, may alter the stringency of a biological or chemical reaction, and therefore any salt may be used that provides the appropriate conditions for a reaction of the present invention and as described herein. Other components of a biological or chemical reaction may include a cell lysis component in order to break open or lyse a cell for analysis of the materials therein. A cell lysis component may include, but is not limited to, a detergent, a salt as described above, such as NaCl, KCl, ammonium sulfate [(NH4)2SO4], or others. Detergents that may be appropriate for the invention may include Triton X-100, sodium dodecyl sulfate nonyl phenoxypolyethoxylethanol (NP-40). Concentrations of detergents may depend on the particular application, and may be specific to the reaction in some cases. Amplification reactions may include dNTPs and nucleic acid primers used at any concentration appropriate for the invention, such as including, but not limited to, a concentration of 100 nM, 150 nM, 200 nM, 250 nM, 850 nM, 900 nM, 950 nM, 1 mM, 2 mM, 3 mM, 4 mM, 5 mM, 6 mM, 7 mM, 8 mM, 9 mM, 10 mM, 20 mM, 30 mM, 40 mM, 50 mM, 60 mM, 70 mM, 80 mM, 90 mM, 100 mM, 150 mM, 200 mM, 250 mM, 300 mM, 350 mM, 400 mM, 450 mM, 500 mM, or the like. Likewise, a polymerase useful in accordance with the invention may be any specific or general polymerase known in the art and useful or the invention, including Taq polymerase, Q5 polymerase, or the like. In some embodiments, amplification reagents as described herein may be appropriate for use in hot-start amplification. Hot start amplification may be beneficial in some embodiments to reduce or eliminate dimerization of adaptor molecules or oligos, or to otherwise prevent unwanted amplification products or artifacts and obtain optimum amplification of the desired product. Many components described herein for use in amplification may also be used in hot-start amplification. In some embodiments, reagents or components appropriate for use with hot-start amplification may be used in place of one or more of the composition components as appropriate. For example, a polymerase or other reagent may be used that exhibits a desired activity at a particular temperature or other reaction condition. In some embodiments, reagents may be used that are designed or optimized for use in hot-start amplification, for example, a polymerase may be activated after transposition or after reaching a particular temperature. Such polymerases may be antibody-based or aptamer-based. Polymerases as described herein are known in the art. Examples of such reagents may include, but are not limited to, hot-start polymerases, hot-start dNTPs, and photo-caged dNTPs. Such reagents are known and available in the art. One of skill in the art will be able to determine the optimum temperatures as appropriate for individual reagents. Amplification of nucleic acids may be performed using specific thermal cycle machinery or equipment, and may be performed in single reactions or in bulk, such that any desired number of reactions may be performed simultaneously. In some embodiments, amplification may be performed using microfluidic or robotic devices, or may be performed using manual alteration in temperatures to achieve the desired amplification. In some embodiments, optimization may be performed to obtain the optimum reactions conditions for the particular application or materials. One of skill in the art will understand and be able to optimize reaction conditions to obtain sufficient amplification. In certain embodiments, detection of DNA with the methods or systems of the invention needs transcription of the (amplified) DNA into RNA prior to detection.CRISPR-Cas its unmodified form, a CRISPR-Cas protein is a catalytically active protein. This implies that upon formation of a nucleic acid-targeting complex (comprising a guide RNA hybridized to a target sequence one or both DNA strands in or near (e.g., within 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 50, or more base pairs from) the target sequence is modified (e.g. cleaved). As used herein the term \"sequence(s) associated with a target locus of interest\" refers to sequences near the vicinity of the target sequence (e.g. within 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 50, or more base pairs from the target sequence, wherein the target sequence is comprised within a target locus of interest). The unmodified catalytically active Cpf1 protein generates a staggered cut, whereby the cut sites are typically within the target sequence. More particularly, the staggered cut is typically 13-23 nucleotides distal to the PAM. In particular embodiments, the cut on the non-target strand is 17 nucleotides downstream of the PAM (i.e. between nucleotide 17 and 18 downstream of the PAM), while the cut on the target strand (i.e. strand hybridizing with the guide sequence) occurs a further 4 nucleotides further from the sequence complementary to the PAM (this is 21 nucleotides upstream of the complement of the PAM on the 3 strand or between nucleotide 21 and 22 upstream of the complement of the PAM).General Features of Cpf1 Effector Protein The present invention encompasses the use of a Cpf1 effector protein, derived from V-A. Herein such effector also referred to as \"Cpf1p\", e.g., a Cpf1 protein (and such effector protein or Cpf1 protein or protein derived from a Cpf1 locus is also called (CRISPR-associated PREFRAN) is a large protein (about 1300 amino acids) that contains a RuvC-like nuclease domain homologous to the corresponding domain of Cas9 along with a counterpart to the characteristic arginine-rich cluster of Cas9. However, Cpf1 lacks the HNH nuclease domain that is present in all Cas9 proteins, and the RuvC-like domain is contiguous in the Cpf1 sequence, in contrast to Cas9 where it contains long inserts including the HNH domain. Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the CRISPR-Cas enzyme comprises a RuvC-like nuclease domain.Orthologs \"orthologue\" (also referred to as \"ortholog\" herein) and \"homologue\" (also referred to as \"homolog\" herein) are well known in the art. By means of further guidance, a \"homologue\" of a protein as used herein is a protein of the same species which performs the same or a similar function as the protein it is a homologue of. Homologous proteins may but need not be structurally related, or are only partially structurally related. An \"orthologue\" of a protein as used herein is a protein of a different species which performs the same or a similar function as the protein it is an orthologue of. Orthologous proteins may but need not be structurally related, or are only partially structurally related. Homologs and orthologs may be identified by homology modelling (see, e.g., Greer, Science vol. 228 (1985) 1055, and Blundell et al. Eur J Biochem vol 172 (1988), 513) or \"structural BLAST\" (Dey F, Cliff Zhang Q, Petrey D, Honig B. Toward a \"structural BLAST\": using structural relationships to infer function. Protein Sci. 2013 April; 22(4):359-66. doi: 10.1002/pro.2225.). See also Shmakov et al. (2015) for application in the field of CRISPR-Cas loci. Homologous proteins may but need not be structurally related, or are only partially structurally related. The Cpf1 gene is found in several diverse bacterial genomes, typically in the same locus with cas1, cas2, and cas4 genes and a (for example, FNFX1_1431-FNFX1_1428 of Francisella cf. novicida Fx1). Thus, the layout of this putative novel CRISPR-Cas system appears to be similar to that of type II-B. Furthermore, similar to Cas9, the Cpf1 protein contains a readily identifiable C-terminal region that is homologous to the transposon ORF-B and includes an active RuvC-like nuclease, an arginine-rich region, and a Zn finger (absent in Cas9). However, unlike Cas9, Cpf1 is also present in several genomes without a CRISPR-Cas context and its relatively high similarity with ORF-B suggests that it might be a transposon component. It was suggested that if this was a genuine CRISPR-Cas system and Cpf1 is a functional analog of Cas9 it would be a novel CRISPR-Cas type, namely type V (See Annotation and Classification of CRISPR-Cas Systems. Makarova K S, Koonin E V. However, be in subtype V-A to distinguish it from Cpf1p which does not have an identical domain structure and is hence denoted to be in subtype V-B. In particular embodiments, the effector protein is a Cpf1 effector protein from an organism from a embodiments, the Cpf1 effector protein is from an organism selected from S. mutans, S. agalactiae, S. equisimilis, S. sanguinis, C. difficile, C. tetani, C. sordellii. The effector protein may comprise a chimeric effector protein comprising a first fragment from a first effector protein (e.g., a Cpf1) ortholog and a second fragment from a second effector (e.g., a Cpf1) protein ortholog, and wherein the first and second effector protein orthologs are different. At least one of the first and second effector protein (e.g., a Cpf1) orthologs may comprise an effector protein (e.g., a Cpf1) chimeric effector protein comprising a first fragment and a second fragment wherein each of the first and second fragments is selected from a Cpf1 of an organism wherein the first and second fragments are not from the same bacteria; for instance a chimeric effector protein comprising a first fragment and a second fragment wherein each of the first and second fragments is selected from a Cpf1 of S. mutans, S. agalactiae, S. equisimilis, macacae, wherein the first and second fragments are not from the same bacteria.

BV3L6, Lachnospiraceae bacterium MA2020. In certain embodiments, the effector protein is derived from a subspecies of Francisella tularensis 1, including but not limited to Francisella tularensis subsp. Novicida. In some embodiments, the Cpf1p is derived from an organism from the genus of Eubacterium.

In embodiments, the Cpf1 effector protein has a sequence homology or sequence identity of at least 60%, more particularly at least 70, such as at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, even more preferably at least 90%, such as for instance at least 95%, with NCBI Reference Sequence WP_055225123.1, NCBI Reference Reference Sequence WP_055272206.1, or GenBank ID OLA16049.1. The skilled person will understand that this includes truncated forms of the Cpf1 protein whereby the sequence identity is determined over the length of the truncated form. In some embodiments, the Cpf1 effector recognizes the PAM sequence of TTTN or CTTN. In particular embodiments, the homologue or orthologue of Cpf1 as referred to herein has a sequence homology or identity of at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, even more preferably at least 90%, such as for instance at least 95% with Cpf1. In further embodiments, the homologue or orthologue of Cpf1 as referred to herein has a sequence identity of at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, even more preferably at least 90%, such as for instance at least 95% with the wild type Cpf1. Where the Cpf1 has one or more mutations (mutated), the homologue or orthologue of said Cpf1 as referred to herein has a sequence identity of at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, even more preferably at least 90%, such as for instance at least 95% with the mutated Cpf1. In an embodiment, the Cpf1 protein may be an ortholog of an organism of a genus which includes, but is not limited to Acidaminococcus sp, Lachnospiraceae bacterium or Moraxella bovoculi; in particular embodiments, the type V Cas protein may be an ortholog of an organism of a species which includes, but is not limited to Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6; Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006 or orthologue of Cpf1 as referred to herein has a sequence homology or identity of at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, even more preferably at least 90%, such as for instance at least 95% with one or more of the Cpf1 sequences disclosed herein. In further embodiments, the homologue or orthologue of Cpf as referred to herein has a sequence identity of at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, even more preferably at least 90%, such as for instance at least 95% with the wild type FnCpf1, AsCpf1 or LbCpf1. In particular embodiments, the Cpf1 protein has a sequence homology or identity of at least 60%, more particularly at least 70, such as at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, even more preferably at least 90%, such as for instance at least 95% with FnCpf1, AsCpf1 or LbCpf1.

In particular embodiments, the Cpf1 protein has less than 60% sequence identity with FnCpf1. The skilled person will understand that this includes truncated forms of the Cpf1 protein whereby the sequence identity is determined over the length of the truncated form.Modified Cpf1 Enzymes In the methods according to the present invention, the CRISPR-Cas protein is preferably mutated with respect to a corresponding wild-type enzyme such that the mutated CRISPR-Cas protein lacks the ability to cleave one or both DNA strands of a target locus containing a target sequence. In particular embodiments, one or more catalytic domains of the Cpf1 protein are mutated to produce a mutated Cas protein which cleaves only one DNA strand of a target sequence. In particular embodiments, the CRISPR-Cas protein may be mutated with respect to a corresponding wild-type enzyme such that the mutated CRISPR-Cas protein lacks substantially all DNA cleavage activity. In some embodiments, a CRISPR-Cas protein may be considered to substantially lack all DNA and/or RNA cleavage activity when the cleavage activity of the mutated enzyme is about no more than 25%, 10%, 5%, 0.01%, or cleavage activity of the non-mutated form of the enzyme; an example can be when the nucleic acid cleavage activity of the mutated form is nil or negligible as compared with the non-mutated form. In certain embodiments of the methods provided herein the CRISPR-Cas protein is a mutated CRISPR-Cas protein which cleaves only one DNA strand, i.e. a nickase. More particularly, in the context of the present invention, the nickase ensures cleavage within the non-target sequence, i.e. the sequence which is on the opposite DNA strand of the target sequence and which is 3 of the PAM sequence. By means of further guidance, and without limitation, an arginine-to-alanine substitution (R1226A) in the Nuc domain of Cpf1 from Acidaminococcus sp. converts Cpf1 from a nuclease that cleaves both strands to a nickase (cleaves a single strand). It will be understood by the skilled person that where the enzyme is not AsCpf1, a mutation may be made at a residue in a corresponding position. In particular embodiments, the Cpf1 is FnCpf1 and the mutation is at the arginine at position R1218. In particular embodiments, the Cpf1 is LbCpf1 and the mutation is at the arginine at position R1138. In particular embodiments, the Cpf1 is MbCpf1 and the mutation is at the arginine at position R1293. In certain embodiments of the methods provided herein the CRISPR-Cas protein has reduced or no catalytic activity. Where the CRISPR-Cas protein is a Cpf1 protein, the mutations may include but are not limited to one or more mutations in the catalytic RuvC-like domain, such as D908A or E993A with reference to the positions in AsCpf1. In some embodiments, a CRISPR-Cas protein is considered to substantially lack all DNA cleavage activity when the DNA cleavage activity of the mutated enzyme is about no more than 25%, 10%, 5%, 1%, 0.1%, 0.01%, or less of the cleavage activity of the non-mutated form of the enzyme; an example can be when the DNA cleavage activity of the mutated form is nil or negligible as compared with the non-mutated form. In these embodiments, the CRISPR-Cas protein is used as a generic DNA binding protein. The mutations may be artificially introduced mutations or gain- or loss-of-function mutations. In addition to the mutations described above, the CRISPR-Cas protein may be additionally modified. As used herein, the term \"modified\" with regard to a CRISPR-Cas protein generally refers to a CRISPR-Cas protein having one or more modifications or mutations (including point mutations, truncations, insertions, deletions, chimeras, fusion proteins, etc.) compared to the wild type Cas protein from which it is derived. By derived is meant that the derived enzyme is largely based, in the sense of having a high degree of sequence homology with, a wildtype enzyme, but that it has been mutated (modified) in some way as known in the art or as described herein. The additional modifications of the CRISPR-Cas protein may or may not cause an altered functionality. By means of example, and in particular with reference to CRISPR-Cas protein, modifications which do not result in an altered functionality include for instance codon optimization for expression into a particular host, or providing the nuclease with a particular marker (e.g. for visualization). Modifications with may result in altered functionality may also include mutations, including point mutations, insertions, deletions, truncations (including split nucleases), etc. Fusion proteins may without limitation include for instance fusions with heterologous domains or functional domains (e.g. localization signals, catalytic domains, etc.). In certain embodiments, various different modifications may be combined (e.g. a mutated nuclease which is catalytically inactive and which further is fused to a functional domain, such as for instance to induce DNA methylation or another nucleic acid modification, such as including without limitation a break (e.g. by a different nuclease (domain)), a mutation, a deletion, an insertion, a replacement, a ligation, a digestion, a break or a recombination). As used herein, \"altered functionality\" includes without limitation an altered specificity (e.g. altered target recognition, increased (e.g. \"enhanced\" Cas proteins) or decreased specificity, or altered PAM recognition), altered activity (e.g. increased or decreased catalytic activity, including catalytically inactive nucleases or nickases), and/or altered stability (e.g. fusions with destabilization domains). Suitable heterologous domains include without limitation a nuclease, a ligase, a repair protein, a methyltransferase, (viral) transposase, an phosphatase, phosphorylase, a sulpfurylase, a kinase, a polymerase, an exonuclease, etc. Examples of all these modifications are known in the art. It will be understood that a \"modified\" nuclease as referred to herein, and in particular a \"modified\" Cas or \"modified\" CRISPR-Cas system or complex preferably still has the capacity to interact with or bind to the polynucleic acid (e.g. in complex with theguide molecule). Such modified Cas protein can be combined with the deaminase protein or active domain thereof as described herein. In certain embodiments, CRISPR-Cas protein may comprise one or more modifications resulting in enhanced activity and/or specificity, such as including mutating residues that stabilize the targeted or non-targeted strand (e.g. eCas9; \"Rationally engineered Cas9 et al. (2016), Science, 351(6268):84-88, incorporated herewith in its entirety by reference). In certain embodiments, the altered or modified activity of the engineered CRISPR protein comprises increased targeting efficiency or decreased off-target binding. In certain embodiments, the altered activity of the engineered CRISPR protein comprises modified cleavage activity. In certain embodiments, the altered activity comprises increased cleavage activity as to the target polynucleotide loci. In certain embodiments, the altered activity comprises decreased cleavage activity as to the target polynucleotide loci. In certain embodiments, the altered activity comprises decreased cleavage activity as to off-target polynucleotide loci. In certain embodiments, the altered or modified activity of the modified nuclease comprises altered helicase kinetics. In certain embodiments, the modified nuclease comprises a modification that alters association of the protein with the nucleic acid molecule comprising RNA (in the case of a Cas protein), or a strand of the target polynucleotide loci, or a strand of off-target polynucleotide loci. In an aspect of the invention, the engineered CRISPR protein comprises a modification that alters formation of the CRISPR complex. In certain embodiments, the altered activity comprises increased cleavage activity as to off-target polynucleotide loci. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, there is increased specificity for target polynucleotide loci as compared to off-target polynucleotide loci. In other embodiments, there is reduced specificity target polynucleotide loci as compared to off-target polynucleotide loci. In certain embodiments, the mutations result in decreased off-target effects (e.g. cleavage or binding properties, activity, or kinetics), such as in case for Cas proteins for instance resulting in a lower tolerance for mismatches between target and guide RNA. Other mutations may lead to increased off-target effects (e.g. cleavage or binding properties, activity, or kinetics). Other mutations may lead to increased or decreased on-target effects (e.g. cleavage or binding properties, activity, or kinetics). In certain embodiments, the mutations result in altered (e.g. increased or decreased) helicase activity, association or formation of the functional nuclease complex (e.g. CRISPR-Cas complex). In certain embodiments, as described above, the mutations result in an altered PAM recognition, i.e. a different PAM may be (in addition or in the alternative) be recognized, compared to the unmodified Cas protein. Particularly preferred mutations include positively charged residues and/or (evolutionary) conserved residues, such as conserved positively charged residues, in order to enhance specificity. In certain embodiments, such residues may be mutated to uncharged residues, such as alanine. In particular embodiments, it is of interest to make us of an engineered Cpf1 protein as defined herein, such as Cpf1, wherein the protein complexes with a nucleic acid molecule comprising RNA to form a CRISPR complex, wherein when in the CRISPR complex, the nucleic acid molecule targets one or more target polynucleotide loci, the protein comprises at least one modification compared to unmodified Cpf1 protein, and wherein the CRISPR complex comprising the modified protein has altered activity as compared to the complex comprising the unmodified Cpf1 protein. It is to be understood that when referring herein to CRISPR \"protein\", the Cpf1 protein preferably is a modified CRISPR enzyme (e.g. having increased or decreased (or no) enzymatic activity, such as without limitation including Cpf1. The term \"CRISPR protein\" may be used interchangeably with \"CRISPR enzyme\", irrespective of whether the CRISPR protein has altered, such as increased or decreased (or no) enzymatic activity, compared to the wild type CRISPR protein. In certain example embodiments, a modified Cpf1 protein comprises at least one modification that alters editing preference as compared to wild type. In certain example embodiments, the editing preference is for a specific insert or deletion within the target region. In certain example embodiments, the at least one modification increases formation of one or more specific indels. In certain example embodiments, the at least one modification is in a C-terminal RuvC like domain, the N-terminal alpha-helical region, the mixed alpha and beta region, or a combination thereof. In certain example embodiments the altered editing preference is indel formation. In certain example embodiments, the at least one modification increases formation of one or more specific insertions. In certain example embodiments, the at least one modification increases formation of one or more specific insertions. In certain example embodiments, the at least one modification results in an insertion of an A adjacent to an A, T, G, or C in the target region. In another example embodiment, the at least one modification results in insertion of a T adjacent to an A, T, G, or C in the target region. In another example embodiment, the at least one modification results in insertion of a G adjacent to an A, T, G, or C in the target region. In another example embodiment, the at least one modification results in insertion of a C adjacent to an A, T, C, or G in the target region. The insertion may be 5 or 3 to the adjacent nucleotide. In one example embodiment, the one or more modification direct insertion of a T adjacent to an existing T. In certain example embodiments, the existing T corresponds to the 4th position in the binding region of a guide sequence. In certain example embodiments, the one or more modifications result in an enzyme which ensures more precise one-base insertions or deletions, such as those described above. More particularly, the one or more modifications may reduce the formations of other types of indels by the enzyme. The ability to generate one-base insertions or deletions can be of interest in a number of applications, such as correction of genetic mutants in diseases caused by small deletions, more particularly where HDR is not possible. For example correction of the F508del mutation in CFTR via delivery of three sRNA directing insertion of three T's, which is the most common genotype of cystic fibrosis, or correction of Alia Jafar's single nucleotide deletion in CDKL5 in the brain. As the editing method may need NHEJ, the editing would be possible in post-mitotic cells such as the brain. The ability to generate one base pair insertions/deletions may also be useful in genome-wide CRISPR-Cas negative selection screens. In certain example embodiments, the at least one modification, is a mutation. In certain other example embodiment, the one or more modification may be combined with one or more additional modifications or mutations described below including modifications to increase binding specificity and/or decrease off-target effects. In certain example embodiments, the engineered CRISPR-cas effector comprising at least one modification that alters editing preference as compared to wild type may further comprise one or more additional modifications that alters the binding property as to the nucleic acid molecule comprising RNA or the target polypeptide loci, altering binding kinetics as to the nucleic acid molecule or target molecule or target polynucleotide or alters binding specificity as to the nucleic acid molecule. Example of such modifications are summarized in the following paragraph. Based on the above information, mutants can be generated which lead to inactivation of the enzyme or which modify the double strand nuclease to nickase activity. In alternative embodiments, this information is used to develop enzymes with reduced off-target effects (described elsewhere herein) In certain of the above-described Cpf1 enzymes, the enzyme is modified by mutation of one or more residues including but not limited to positions D917, E1006, E1028, D1227, D1255A, N1257, according to FnCpf1 protein or any corresponding ortholog. In an aspect the invention provides a herein-discussed composition wherein the Cpf1 enzyme is an inactivated enzyme which comprises one or more mutations selected from the group consisting or corresponding positions in a Cpf1 ortholog. In an aspect the invention provides a herein-discussed composition, wherein the CRISPR enzyme comprises D917, or D917, or D917 and D1255, according to FnCpf1 protein or a corresponding position in a Cpf1 ortholog. In certain of the above-described Cpf1 enzymes, the enzyme is modified by mutation of one or more residues (in the RuvC domain) including but not limited acid position numbering of AsCpf1 (Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6). In certain of the above-described non-naturally-occurring CRISPR enzymes, the enzyme is modified by mutation of one or more residues (in the RAD50) domain including but not acid position numbering of AsCpf1 (Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6). In certain of the Cpf1 enzymes, the enzyme is modified by mutation of one or more residues including but not limited acid position numbering of AsCpf1 (Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6). In certain embodiments, the Cpf1 enzyme is modified by mutation of one or more residues including but not limited acid position numbering of LbCpf1 (Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006). In certain embodiments, the Cpf1 enzyme is modified by mutation of one or more residues including but not limited acid position numbering of AsCpf1 (Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6). In certain embodiments, the enzyme is modified by mutation of one or more residues including but not limited numbering of FnCpf1 (Francisella novicida U112). In certain embodiments, the enzyme is modified by mutation of one or more residues including but not limited acid position numbering of LbCpf1 (Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006). In certain embodiments, the enzyme is modified by mutation of one or more residues including but not limited acid position numbering of MbCpf1 (Moraxella bovoculi 237). Recently a method was described for the generation of Cas9 orthologs with enhanced specificity (Slaymaker et al. 2015). This strategy can be used to enhance the specificity of Cpf1 orthologs. The following modifications are presently considered to provide enhanced Cpf1 specificity. Additional candidates are positive charged residues that are conserved between different orthologs (Table 2). Table 2 provides the positions of conserved Lysine and Arginine residues in can be used to generate Cpf1 mutants with enhanced specificity. With a similar strategy used to improve Cas9 specificity, specificity of Cpf1 can be improved by mutating residues that stabilize the non-targeted DNA strand. This may be accomplished without a crystal structure by using linear structure alignments to predict 1) which domain of Cpf1 binds to which strand of DNA and 2) which residues within these domains contact DNA. However, this approach may be limited due to poor conservation of Cpf1 with known proteins. Thus it may be desirable to probe the function of all likely DNA interacting amino acids (lysine, histidine and arginine). Positively charged residues in the RuvC domain are more conserved throughout Cpf1s than those in the Rad50 domain indicating that RuvC residues are less evolutionarily flexible. This suggests that rigid control of nucleic acid binding is needed in this domain (relative to the Rad50 domain). Therefore, it is possible this domain cuts the targeted DNA strand because of the requirement for RNA:DNA duplex stabilization (precedent in Cas9). Furthermore, more arginines are present in the RuvC domain (5% of RuvC residues 904 to 1307 vs 3.8% in the proposed Rad50 domains) suggesting again that RuvC targets the DNA strand complexed with the guide RNA. Arginines are more involved in binding nucleic acid major and minor grooves (Rohs et al. Nature (2009): Vol 461: 1248-1254). Major/minor grooves would only be present in a duplex (such as DNA:RNA targeting duplex), further suggesting that RuvC cuts the \"targeted strand\". From these specific observations about AsCpf1 we can identify similar residues in Cpf1 from other species by sequence alignments. Example given in Where the Cpf1 protein has nuclease activity, the Cpf1 protein may be modified to have diminished nuclease activity e.g., nuclease inactivation of at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, or 100% as compared with the wild type enzyme; or to put in another way, a Cpf1 enzyme having advantageously about 0% of the nuclease activity non-mutated or wild type Cpf1 enzyme or CRISPR enzyme, or no more than about 3% or about 5% or about 10% of the nuclease activity of the non-mutated or wild type Cpf1 enzyme, e.g. of This is possible by introducing mutations into the nuclease domains of the Cpf1 and orthologs thereof. In certain embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme is engineered and can comprise one or more mutations that reduce or eliminate a nuclease activity. The amino acid positions in the FnCpf1p RuvC domain include but are identified a putative second nuclease domain which is most similar to PD-(D/E)XK nuclease superfamily and HincII endonuclease like. The point mutations to be generated in this putative nuclease domain to substantially reduce nuclease activity include but in the FnCpf1p RuvC domain is D917A or E1006A, wherein the D917A or E1006A mutation completely inactivates the DNA cleavage activity of the FnCpf1 effector protein. In another embodiment, the mutation in the FnCpf1p RuvC domain is D1255A, wherein the mutated FnCpf1 effector protein has significantly reduced nucleolytic activity. More particularly, the inactivated Cpf1 enzymes include enzymes mutated in amino acid positions As908, As993, As1263 of AsCpf1 or corresponding positions in Cpf1 orthologs. Additionally, the inactivated Cpf1 enzymes include enzymes mutated in amino acid position Lb832, 925, 947 or 1180 of LbCpf1 or corresponding positions in Cpf1 orthologs. More particularly, the inactivated Cpf1 enzymes include enzymes comprising one or more of mutations AsD908A, AsE993A, AsD1263A of AsCpf1 or corresponding mutations in Cpf1 orthologs. Additionally, the inactivated Cpf1 enzymes include enzymes comprising one or more of mutations LbD832A, E925A, D947A or D1180A of LbCpf1 or corresponding mutations in Cpf1 orthologs. Mutations can also be made at neighboring residues, e.g., at amino acids near those indicated above that participate in the nuclease activity. In some embodiments, only the RuvC domain is inactivated, and in other embodiments, another putative nuclease domain is inactivated, wherein the effector protein complex functions as a nickase and cleaves only one DNA strand. In a preferred embodiment, the other putative nuclease domain is a HincII-like FnCpf1, AsCpf1 or LbCpf1 variants (each a different nickase) are used to increase specificity, two nickase variants are used to cleave DNA at a target (where both nickases cleave a DNA strand, while minimizing or eliminating off-target modifications where only one DNA strand is cleaved and subsequently repaired). In preferred embodiments the Cpf1 effector protein cleaves sequences associated with or at a target locus of interest as a homodimer comprising two Cpf1 effector protein molecules. In a preferred embodiment the homodimer may comprise two Cpf1 effector protein molecules comprising a different mutation in their respective RuvC domains. The inactivated Cpf1 CRISPR enzyme may have associated (e.g., via fusion protein or suitable linkers) one or more functional domains, including for example, one or more domains from the group comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of deaminase activity, methylase activity, demethylase activity, transcription activation activity, transcription repression activity, transcription release factor activity, histone modification activity, RNA cleavage activity, DNA cleavage activity, nucleic acid binding activity, and molecular switches (e.g., light inducible). Suitable linkers for use in the methods of the present invention are well known to those of skill in the art and include, but are not limited to, straight or branched-chain carbon linkers, heterocyclic carbon linkers, or peptide linkers. However, used the linker may also be a covalent bond (carbon-carbon bond or carbon-heteroatom bond). In particular embodiments, the linker is used to separate the targeting domain and the nucleotide deaminase by a distance sufficient to ensure that each protein retains its required functional property. Preferred peptide linker sequences adopt a flexible extended conformation and do not exhibit a propensity for developing an ordered secondary structure. In certain embodiments, the linker can be a chemical moiety which can be monomeric, dimeric, multimeric or polymeric. Preferably, the linker comprises amino acids. Typical amino acids in flexible linkers include Gly, Asn and Ser. Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the linker comprises a combination of one or more of Gly, Asn and Ser amino acids. Other near neutral amino acids, such as Thr and Ala, also may be used in the linker sequence. Exemplary linkers are disclosed in Maratea et al. (1985), Gene 40: 39-46; Murphy et al. (1986) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. 83: 8258-62; GGS, GGGS (SEQ or GGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 12) linkers can be used in repeats of 3 (such as (GGS)3 (SEQ ID No: 14), (GGGGS)3) (SEQ ID (SEQ NO: 6 (SEQ ID NO: 2), 7 (SEQ ID NO: 16), 9 (SEQ ID NO: 3) or even 12 (SEQ ID NO: 4) or more, to provide suitable lengths. In particular embodiments, linkers such as (GGGGS)3 (SEQ ID (GGGGS)12 (SEQ ID NO: 4) may preferably be used as alternatives. Other preferred alternatives are (GGGGS)1 (SEQ ID NO: yet a further embodiment, LEPGEKPYKCPECGKSFSQSGALTRHQRTHTR (SEQ ID No: 453) is used as a linker. In yet an additional embodiment, the linker is XTEN linker. In addition, N- and NLSs also function as linker (e.g., PKKKRKVEASSPKKRKVEAS (SEQ ID NO: 22) Preferred functional domains are nucleotide deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) and other MyoD1. In the event that deaminase is provided, it is advantageous that a guide sequence is designed to introduce one or more mismatches in an RNA duplex or a RNA/DNA heteroduplex formed between the guide sequence and the target sequence. In particular embodiments, the duplex between the guide sequence and the target sequence comprises a A-C mismatch. In the event that Fok1 is provided, it is advantageous that multiple Fok1 functional domains are provided to allow for a functional dimer and that gRNAs are designed to provide proper spacing for functional use (Fok1) as specifically described in Tsai et al. Nature Biotechnology, Vol. 32, Number 6, June 2014). The adaptor protein may utilize known linkers to attach such functional domains. In some cases it is advantageous that additionally at least one NLS is provided. In some instances, it is advantageous to position the NLS at the N terminus. When more than one functional domain is included, the functional domains may be the same or different. In general, the positioning of the one or more functional domain on the inactivated Cpf1 enzyme is one which allows for correct spatial orientation for the functional domain to affect the target with the attributed functional effect. For example, if the functional domain is a transcription activator (e.g., VP64 or p65), the transcription activator is placed in a spatial orientation which allows it to affect the transcription of the target. Likewise, a transcription repressor will be advantageously positioned to affect the transcription of the target, and a nuclease (e.g., Fok1) will be advantageously positioned to cleave or partially cleave the target. This may include positions other than the N-/C-terminus of the CRISPR enzyme.Determination of PAM Determination of PAM can be ensured as follows This experiment closely parallels similar work in E. coli for the heterologous expression of StCas9 (Sapranauskas, R. et al. Nucleic Acids Res 39, 9275-9282 (2011)). Applicants introduce a plasmid containing both a PAM and a resistance gene into the heterologous E. coli, and then plate on the corresponding antibiotic. If there is DNA cleavage of the plasmid, Applicants observe no viable colonies. In further detail, the assay is as follows for a DNA target. Two E. coli strains are used in this assay. One carries a plasmid that encodes the endogenous effector protein locus from the bacterial strain. The other strain carries an empty plasmid (e.g. pACYC184, control strain). All possible 7 or 8 bp PAM sequences are presented on an antibiotic resistance plasmid (pUC19 with ampicillin resistance gene). The PAM is located next to the sequence of proto-spacer 1 (the DNA target to the first spacer in the endogenous effector protein locus). Two PAM libraries were cloned. One has a 8 random bp 5 of the proto-spacer (e.g. total of 65536 different PAM sequences=complexity). The other library has 7 random bp 3 of the proto-spacer (e.g. total complexity is 16384 different PAMs). Both libraries were cloned to have in average 500 plasmids per possible PAM. Test strain and control strain were transformed with 5PAM and 3PAM library in separate transformations and transformed cells were plated separately on ampicillin plates. Recognition and subsequent cutting/interference with the plasmid renders a cell vulnerable to ampicillin and prevents growth. Approximately 12 h after transformation, all colonies formed by the test and control strains where harvested and plasmid DNA was isolated. Plasmid DNA was used as template for PCR amplification and subsequent deep sequencing. Representation of all PAMs in the untransformed libraries showed the expected representation of PAMs in transformed cells. Representation of all PAMs found in control strains showed the actual representation. Representation of all PAMs in test strain showed which PAMs are not recognized by the enzyme and comparison to the control strain allows extracting the sequence of the depleted PAM. For the Cpf1 orthologues identified to date, the following PAMs have target sites preceded by a TTTV PAM, FnCpf1p, can cleave sites preceded by TTN, where N is A/C/G or T, Codon Optimized Nucleic Acid Sequences Where the effector protein is to be administered as a nucleic acid, the application envisages the use of codon-optimized Cpf1 sequences. An example of a codon optimized sequence, is in this instance a sequence optimized for expression in a eukaryote, e.g., humans (i.e. being optimized for expression in humans), or for another eukaryote, animal or mammal as herein discussed; see, e.g., SaCas9 human codon optimized sequence in WO 2014/093622 (PCT/US2013/074667) as an example of a codon optimized sequence (from knowledge in the art and this disclosure, codon optimizing coding nucleic acid molecule(s), especially as to effector protein (e.g., Cpf1) is within the ambit of the skilled artisan). Whilst this is preferred, it will be appreciated that other examples are possible and codon optimization for a host species other than human, or for codon optimization for specific organs is known. In some embodiments, an enzyme coding sequence encoding a DNA/RNA-targeting Cas protein is codon optimized for expression in particular cells, such as eukaryotic cells. The eukaryotic cells may be those of or derived from a particular organism, such as a plant or a mammal, including but not limited to human, or non-human eukaryote or animal or mammal as herein discussed, e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, livestock, or non-human mammal or primate. In some embodiments, processes for modifying the germ line genetic identity of human beings and/or processes for modifying the genetic identity of animals which are likely to cause them suffering without any substantial medical benefit to man or animal, and also animals resulting from such processes, may be excluded. In general, codon optimization refers to a process of modifying a nucleic acid sequence for enhanced expression in the host cells of interest by replacing at least one codon (e.g., about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, or more codons) of the native sequence with codons that are more frequently or most frequently used in the genes of that host cell while maintaining the native amino acid sequence. Various species exhibit particular bias for certain codons of a particular amino acid. Codon bias (differences in codon usage between organisms) often correlates with the efficiency of translation of messenger RNA (mRNA), which is in turn believed to be dependent on, among other things, the properties of the codons being translated and the availability of particular transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The predominance of selected tRNAs in a cell is generally a reflection of the codons used most frequently in peptide synthesis. Accordingly, genes can be tailored for optimal gene expression in a given organism based on codon optimization. Codon usage tables are readily available, for example, at the \"Codon Usage Database\" available at www.kazusa.orjp/codon/and these tables can be adapted in a number of ways. See Nakamura, Y., et al. \"Codon usage tabulated from the international DNA sequence databases: status for the year 2000\" Nucl. Acids Res. 28:292 (2000). Computer algorithms for codon optimizing a particular sequence for expression in a particular host cell are also available, such as Gene Forge (Aptagen; Jacobus, Pa.), are also available. In some embodiments, one or more codons (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, or more, or all codons) in a sequence encoding a DNA/RNA-targeting Cas protein corresponds to the most frequently used codon for a particular amino acid.

The nucleotide deaminase may be adenosine deaminase. Additionally or alternatively, be The term \"deaminase-functionalized CRISPR system\" as used herein refers to a nucleic acid targeting and editing system comprising (a) a CRISPR-Cas protein as described herein, more particularly a Cas protein (e.g., Cpf1) which is catalytically inactive; (b) a guide molecule which comprises a guide sequence; and (c) a nucleotid deaminase, such as an adenosine or cytodine deaminase, or a catalytic domain thereof; wherein the nucleotide deaminase protein or catalytic domain thereof is covalently or non-covalently linked to the CRISPR-Cas protein or the guide molecule or is adapted to link thereto after delivery; wherein the guide sequence is substantially complementary to the target sequence but comprises a non-pairing nucleotide corresponding to the nucleotide to be targeted for deamination, resulting in a mismatch in an RNA duplex formed by the guide sequence and the target sequence. For application in eukaryotic cells, the CRISPR-Cas protein and/or the nucleotide deaminase deaminase used herein refers to a protein, a polypeptide, or one or more functional domain(s) of a protein or a polypeptide that is capable of catalyzing a hydrolytic deamination reaction that converts an adenine (or an adenine moiety of a molecule) to a hypoxanthine (or a hypoxanthine moiety of a molecule), as shown below. In some embodiments, the adenine-containing molecule is an adenosine (A), and the hypoxanthine-containing molecule is an inosine (I). The adenine-containing molecule can be deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA). Adenosine deaminases that can be used in connection with the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, members of the enzyme family known as adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs), members of the enzyme family known as adenosine deaminases RNA (ADAR) family of enzymes mediates endogenous editing of transcripts via hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine, a nucleobase that is functionally equivalent to guanosine in translation and splicing. There are two functional human ADAR orthologs, ADAR1 and ADAR2, which consist of N-terminal double RNA-binding domains and a C-terminal catalytic deamination domain. Endogenous target sites of ADAR1 and ADAR2 contain substantial double stranded identity, and the catalytic domains may need duplexed regions for efficient editing in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, the ADAR catalytic domain is capable of deaminating target adenosines without any protein co-factors in vitro (20). ADAR1 has been found to target mainly repetitive regions whereas ADAR2 mainly targets non-repetitive coding regions. Although ADAR proteins have preferred motifs for editing that could restrict the potential flexibility of targeting, hyperactive mutants, such as ADAR(E488Q), relax sequence constraints and improve adenosine inosine editing rates. ADARs preferentially deaminate adenosines opposite cytidine bases in RNA duplexes, providing a promising opportunity for precise base editing. Although previous approaches have engineered targeted ADAR fusions via RNA guides, the specificity of these approaches has not been reported and their respective targeting mechanisms rely on RNA-RNA hybridization without the assistance of protein partners that may enhance target recognition and stringency. Crystal structures of the human ADAR2 deaminase domain bound to duplex RNA reveal a protein loop that binds the RNA on the 5 side of the modification site. This 5 binding loop is one contributor to substrate specificity differences between ADAR family members. See Wang et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 44(20):9872-9880 (2016), the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In addition, an ADAR2-specific RNA-binding loop was identified near the enzyme active site. See Mathews et al., Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol., 23(5):426-33 (2016), the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, the adenosine deaminase comprises one or more mutations in the RNA binding loop to improve editing specificity and/or efficiency. According to the present disclosure, adenosine deaminase is capable of targeting adenine in a RNA/DNA and RNA duplexes. Indeed, Zheng et al. (Nucleic Acids Res. 2017, 45(6): 3369-3377) demonstrate that ADARs can carry out inosine editing reactions on and RNA/RNA duplexes. In particular embodiments, the adenosine deaminase has been modified to increase its ability to edit RNA in a RNA/DNA and RNA duplex.

Results suggest that A's opposite C's in the targeting window of the ADAR deaminase domain may be preferentially edited over other bases. Additionally, A's base-paired with U's within a few bases of the targeted base may have low levels of editing. Accordingly, multiple A's in the activity window of Cpf1-ADAR fusions could be specified for editing by mismatching all A's to be edited with C's. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, multiple A:C mismatches in the activity window are designed to create multiple A:I edits. In certain embodiments, to suppress potential off-target editing in the activity window, non-target A's are paired with A's or G's.

Split Designs It is often desirable to deplete or kill cells based on the presence of aberrant endogenous or foreign DNA, either for basic biology applications to study the role of specific cells types or for therapeutic applications such as cancer or infected cell clearance (Baker, D. J., Childs, B. G., Durik, M., Wijers, M. E., Sieben, C. J., Zhong, J., Saltness, R. A., Jeganathan, K. B., Verzosa, G. C., Pezeshki, A., et al. (2016). Naturally occurring p16(Ink4a)-positive cells shorten healthy lifespan. Nature 530, 184-189.). This targeted cell killing can be achieved by fusing split apoptotic domains to Cpf1 proteins, which upon binding to the DNA are reconstituted, leading to death of cells specifically expressing targeted genes or sets of genes. In certain embodiments, the apoptotic domains may be split Caspase 3 (Chelur, D. S., and Chalfie, M. (2007). Targeted cell killing by reconstituted caspases. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 2283-2288.). Other possibilities are the assembly of Caspases, such as bringing two Caspase 8 (Pajvani, U. B., Trujillo, M. E., Combs, T. P., Iyengar, P., Jelicks, L., Roth, K. A., Kitsis, R. N., and Scherer, P. E. (2005). Fat apoptosis through targeted activation of caspase 8: a new mouse model of inducible and reversible lipoatrophy. Nat. Med. 11, 797-803.) or Caspase 9 (Straathof, K. C., Pul\u00e8, M. A., Yotnda, P., Dotti, G., Vanin, E. F., Brenner, M. K., Heslop, H. E., Spencer, D. M., and Rooney, C. M. (2005). An inducible caspase 9 safety switch for T-cell therapy. Blood 105, 4247-4254.) effectors in proximity via Cpf1 binding. It is also possible to reconstitute a split TEV (Gray, D. C., Mahrus, S., and Wells, J. A. (2010). Activation of specific apoptotic caspases with an engineered small-molecule-activated protease. Cell 142, 637-646.) via Cpf1 binding on a transcript. This split TEV can be used in a variety of readouts, including luminescent and fluorescent readouts (Wehr, M. C., Bolz, U., Fischer, T. M., Grunewald, S., Scheek, S., Bach, A., Nave, K.-A., and Rossner, M J. (2006). Monitoring regulated protein-protein interactions using split TEV. Nat. Methods 3, 985-993.). One embodiment involves the reconstitution of this split TEV to cleave modified pro-caspase 3 or pro-caspase 7 (Gray, D. C., Mahrus, S., and Wells, J. A. (2010). Activation of specific apoptotic caspases with an engineered small-molecule-activated protease. Cell 142, 637-646), resulting in cell death.Inducible Apoptosis According to the invention, guides can be used to locate Cpf1 complexes bearing functional domains to induce apoptosis. The Cpf1 can be any ortholog. In one embodiment, functional domains are fused at the C-terminus of the protein. The Cpf1 is catalytically inactive for example via mutations that knock out nuclease activity. The adaptability of system can be demonstrated by employing various methods of caspase activation, and optimization of guide spacing along a target nucleic acid. Caspase 8 and caspase 9 (aka\"initiator\" caspases) activity can be induced using Cpf1 complex formation to bring together caspase 8 or caspase 9 enzymes associated with Cpf1. Alternatively, caspase 3 and caspase 7 (aka \"effector\" caspases) activity can be induced R when Cpf1 complexes bearing tobacco etch virus (TEV) N-terminal and C-terminal portions (\"snipper\") are maintained in proximity, activating the TEV protease activity and leading to cleavage and activation of caspase 3 or caspase 7 pro-proteins. The system can employ split caspase 3, with heterodimerization of the caspase 3 portions by attachment to Cpf1 complexes bound to a target nucleic acid. Exemplary apoptotic components are set forth in the table 4 below. Split-fluorophore constructs are useful for imaging with reduced background via reconstitution of a split fluorophoreupon binding of two Cpf1 proteins to a transcript. These split proteins include iSplit (Filonov, G. S., and Verkhusha, V V. (2013). A near-infrared BiFC reporter for in vivo imaging of protein protein-interactions. ALAEPGAA A Chem. Biol. 20, 1086.), Split Venus (Wu, B., Chen, J, and Singer, R. H (2014). Background free imaging of single mRNTAs in live cells using split fluorescent proteins. Sci. Rep. 4, 3615.), and Split superpositive GFP (Blakeley, B. D., Chapman, A. M, and McNaughton, B. R. (2012). Split-superpositive GFP reassembly is a fast, efficient, and robust method for detecting protein-protein interactions in vivo. Mol. Biosyst. 8, 20362040.). Such proteins are set forth in the table 5 below: Tobacco etch virus can be used for modulating components of imaging systems such as, but not limited to fluorophores, and including spatial and temporal control. TEV can be adapted to cleavage of blocking groups that inhibit fluorescence. TEV can be adapted to cleave degrons from proteins such as transcription factors or other proteins to promote expression. TEV can be used to cleave localization factors, for example to induce relocation of imaging components within a cell, including but not limited to nucleus, membranes, and organelles.Split Designs for Activation of Transcriptional Activity Additional possible split fusions that could be constituted by Cpf1 proteins could include luciferase for luminescent imaging (Kim, S. B., Ozawa, T., Watanabe, S., and Umezawa, Y. (2004). High-throughput sensing and noninvasive imaging of protein nuclear transport by using reconstitution of split Renilla luciferase. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 101, 11542-11547.) or split transcription factors to drive expression of genes of genetic circuits. Possible split transcription factors include split-ubquitin based systems, such as the split-ubiquitin-LexA system (Petschnigg, J., Groisman, B., Kotlyar, M., Taipale, M., Zheng, Y., Kurat, C. F., Sayad, A., Sierra, J R., Mattiazzi Usaj, M., Snider, J., et al. (2014). The mammalian-membrane two-hybrid assay (MaMTH) for probing membrane-protein interactions in human cells. Nat. Methods 11, 585-592.)Methods for Identifying New CRISPR-Cas Loci The Cpf1 gene is found in several diverse bacterial genomes, typically in the same locus with cas1, cas2, and cas4 genes and a (for example, FNFX1_1431-FNFX1_1428 of Francisella cf. novicida Fx1). Thus, the layout of this novel CRISPR-Cas system appears to be similar to that of type II-B. Furthermore, similar to Cas9, the Cpf1 protein contains a readily identifiable C-terminal region that is homologous to the transposon ORF-B and includes an active RuvC-like nuclease, an arginine-rich region, and a Zn finger (absent in Cas9). However, unlike Cas9, Cpf1 is also present in several genomes without a CRISPR-Cas context and its relatively high similarity with ORF-B suggests that it might be a transposon component. It was suggested that if this was a genuine CRISPR-Cas system and Cpf1 is a functional analog of Cas9 it would be a novel CRISPR-Cas type, namely type V (See Annotation and Classification of CRISPR-Cas Systems. Makarova K S, Koonin E V. However, be in subtype V-A to distinguish it from Cpf1p which does not have an identical domain structure and is hence denoted to be in subtype V-B. The application describes methods for using CRISPR-Cas proteins in therapy. This is exemplified herein with Cpf1, whereby a number of Cpf1 orthologs or homologs have been identified. It will be apparent to the skilled person that further Cpf1 orthologs or homologs can be identified and that any of the functionalities described herein may be engineered into other Cpf1 orthologs, including chimeric enzymes comprising fragments from multiple orthologs. For instance, computational methods of identifying novel CRISPR-Cas loci are described in EP3009511 or US2016208243 and may comprise the following steps: detecting all contigs encoding the Cas1 protein; identifying all predicted protein coding genes within 20 kB of the cas1 gene; comparing the identified genes with Cas protein-specific profiles and predicting CRISPR arrays; selecting unclassified candidate CRISPR-Cas loci containing proteins larger than 500 amino acids (>500 aa); analyzing selected candidates using methods such as PSI-BLAST and HHPred to screen for known protein domains, thereby identifying novel Class 2 CRISPR-Cas loci (see also Schmakov et al. 2015, Mol Cell. 60(3):385-97). In addition to the above mentioned steps, additional analysis of the candidates may be conducted by searching metagenomics databases for additional homologs. Additionally or alternatively, to expand the search to non-autonomous CRISPR-Cas systems, the same procedure can be performed with the CRISPR array used as the seed. In one aspect the detecting all contigs encoding the Cas1 protein is performed by GenemarkS which a gene prediction program as further described in \"GeneMarkS: a self-training method for prediction of gene starts in microbial genomes. Implications for finding sequence motifs in Besemer, Alexandre Lomsadze pp 2607-2618, herein incorporated by reference. In one aspect the identifying all predicted protein coding genes is carried out by comparing the identified genes with Cas protein-specific profiles and annotating them according to NCBI Conserved Domain Database (CDD) which is a protein annotation resource that consists of a collection of well-annotated multiple sequence alignment models for ancient domains and full-length proteins. These are available as position-specific score matrices (PSSMs) for fast identification of conserved domains in protein sequences via RPS-BLAST. CDD content includes NCBI-curated domains, which use 3D-structure information to explicitly define domain boundaries and provide insights into sequence/structure/function relationships, as well as domain models imported from a number of external source databases (Pfam, SMART, COG, PRK, TIGRFAM). In a further aspect, CRISPR arrays were predicted using a PILER-CR program which is a public domain software for finding CRISPR repeats as described in \"PILER-CR: fast and accurate identification of CRISPR repeats\", Edgar, R. C., BMC Bioinformatics, January 20; 8:18(2007), herein incorporated by reference. In a further aspect, the case by case analysis is performed using PSI-BLAST (Position-Specific Iterative Basic Local Alignment Search Tool). PSI-BLAST derives a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) or profile from the multiple sequence alignment of sequences detected above a given score threshold using protein-protein BLAST. This PSSM is used to further search the database for new matches, and is updated for subsequent iterations with these newly detected sequences. Thus, PSI-BLAST provides a means of detecting distant relationships between proteins. In another aspect, the case by case analysis is performed using HHpred, a method for sequence database searching and structure prediction that is as easy to use as BLAST or PSI-BLAST and that is at the same time much more sensitive in finding remote homologs. In fact, HHpred's sensitivity is competitive with the most powerful servers for structure prediction currently available. HHpred is the first server that is based on the pairwise comparison of profile hidden Markov models (HMMs). Whereas most conventional sequence search methods search sequence databases such as UniProt or the NR, HHpred searches alignment databases, like Pfam or SMART. This greatly simplifies the list of hits to a number of sequence families instead of a clutter of single sequences. All major publicly available profile and alignment databases are available through HHpred. HHpred accepts a single query sequence or a multiple alignment as input. Within only a few minutes it returns the search results in an easy-to-read format similar to that of PSI-BLAST. Search options include local or global alignment and scoring secondary structure similarity. HHpred can produce pairwise query-template sequence alignments, merged query-template multiple alignments (e.g. for transitive searches), as well as 3D structural models calculated by the MODELLER software from HHpred alignments. In certain example embodiments, methods for identifying novel CRISPR loci may include comparison to properties and elements of known CRISPR loci. Example methods are disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/376,387 filed Aug. 17, 2016 and entitled \"Methods for identifying Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems,\" U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/376,383 filed Aug. 17, 2016 and entitled \"Methods for Identifying Novel Gene Editing Elements,\" and Shmakov et al. \"Diversity and evolution of class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems,\" Nat Rev Microbiol. 2017 15(3):169-182. Finally, methods such as those disclosed above may also be adaptive to identify genomic structures comprising repeating motifs in general as opposed to specific known CRISPR objects such as Cas9 or Cpf1. It should be further recognized that putative novel CRISPR-Cas loci may be further discovered and or integrated, in particular for relevant nuclease activity, using the methods disclosed in the section below under the header \"Methods for determining on/off target activity and selecting suitable sequences/guides.\"Optimization of CRISPR-Cas Systems In another aspect, the present invention relates to methods for developing or designing CRISPR-Cas systems.

In certain embodiments, target sequences or loci as described herein are (further) selected based on optimization of one or more parameters consisting of; PAM type (natural or modified), PAM nucleotide content, PAM length, target sequence length, PAM restrictiveness, target cleavage efficiency, and target sequence position within a gene, a locus or other genomic region. In certain embodiments, target sequences or loci as described herein are (further) selected based on optimization of one or more of target loci location, target length, target specificity, and PAM characteristics. As used herein, PAM characteristics may comprise for instance PAM sequence, PAM length, and/or PAM GC contents. In certain embodiments, optimizing PAM characteristics comprises optimizing nucleotide content of a PAM. In certain embodiments, optimizing nucleotide content of PAM is selecting a PAM with an a motif that maximizes abundance in the one or more target loci, minimizes mutation frequency, or both. Minimizing mutation frequency can for instance be achieved by selecting PAM sequences devoid of or having low or minimal CpG. In certain embodiments, the effector protein for each CRISPR-Cas system in the set of CRISPR-Cas systems is selected based on optimization of one or more parameters selected from the group consisting of; effector protein size, ability of effector protein to access regions of high chromatin accessibility, degree of uniform enzyme activity across genomic targets, epigenetic tolerance, mismatch/budge tolerance, effector specificity, effector protein stability or half-life, effector protein immunogenicity or toxicity. In certain embodiments, optimizing target (sequence) length comprises selecting a target sequence within one or more target loci between 5 and 25 nucleotides. In certain embodiments, a target sequence is 20 nucleotides. In certain embodiments, optimizing target specificity comprises selecting targets loci that minimize off-target candidates. In certain embodiments, the gRNA is a tru gRNA, an escorted gRNA, or a protected gRNA. It will be understood that the CRISPR-Cas systems according to the invention as described herein, such as the CRISPR-Cas systems for use in the methods according to the invention as described herein, may be suitably used for any type of application known for CRISPR-Cas systems, preferably in eukaryotes. In certain aspects, the application is therapeutic, preferably therapeutic in a eukaryote organism, such as including but not limited to animals (including human), plants, algae, fungi (including yeasts), etc. Alternatively, or in addition, in certain aspects, the application may involve accomplishing or inducing one or more particular traits or characteristics, such as genotypic and/or phenotypic traits or characteristics, as also described herein elsewhere. For the invention described herein, the following criteria may be taken into account when optimizing the respective parameters or variables.CRISPR Effector Choice 1. Size: Currently, CRISPR single nuclease effectors demonstrating high efficiency mammalian genome editing range from 1053 amino acids (SaCas9) to 1368 amino acids (SpCas9), and LbCpf1, 1246). While smaller orthologs of Cas9 do exist and cleave DNA with high efficiency in vitro, Cas9 orthologs smaller than SaCas9 have shown diminished mammalian DNA cleavage efficiency. The large size of current single effector CRISPR nucleases is challenging for both nanoparticle protein delivery and viral vector delivery strategies. For protein delivery, payload per particle is a function of 3-D protein size, and for viral delivery of single effectors, large gene size limits flexibility for multiplexing or use of large cell-type specific promoters. Considerations relating to delivery are described detailed further herein below.2. Protein Search: The ability of the CRISPR effector to access regions of high chromatin complexity can be viewed in two ways 1) this increases the versatility of the CRISPR effector as a tool for genome editing or 2) this may be undesirable due to cellular dysregulation resulting from perturbation of the genomic structure of cells contacted with the CRISPR effector. There have been reports that the active Cas9 guides are ones that target low nucleosomal occupancy positions: elifesciences.org/content/5/e12677, and elifesciences.org/content/5/e13450; however, over a longer time scale, cleavage can still occur (also cleavage can occur during replication when the nucleosomal occupancy is moved) Considerations relating to choice of Cpf1 and modifications thereof are described detailed further herein below.3. Efficacy: Overall efficiency: robust and uniform enzyme activity across genomic targets in regions of open chromatin is generally desirable for all single effector nucleases. On the other hand, robust and uniform enzyme activity across genomic targets with varying chromatin complexity and epigenetic marks may not be desirable for research and therapeutic applications. It has been shown that Cas9 shows robust cleavage of methylated DNA, and this increases the utility of the enzyme. On the other hand, CRISPR effector binding or cleavage at loci enriched for epigenetic marks may dysregulate cellular processes. A further aspect to be considered is whether enzymes that do not disturb chromatin structure are desirable. If cleaving a locus in a terminally differentiated cell, it may be desirable to utilize enzymes that are not capable of penetrating silenced regions of the genome. Alternatively, when cleaving a locus in a precursor of a differentiated cell type, then it may be advantageous to be able to penetrate regions of the genome inactive at the time of editing.4. show tolerance of mismatches or bulges between the RNA guide and DNA target. This tolerance is generally undesirable for therapeutic applications. For therapeutic applications, patients should be individually screened for perfect target guide RNA complementarity, and tolerance of bulges and mismatches will only increase the likelihood of off-target DNA cleavage. High specificity engineered variants have been developed, such as eSpCas9 and Cas9-HF1 for Cas9; these variants show decreased tolerance of mismatches between DNA targets and the RNA guide (relevant to mismatches in approximately the PAM distal 12-14 nucleotides of the guide RNA given 20 nt of guide RNA target complementarity).5. PAM Choice: Natural PAM vs. Modified PAM: Targets for each single effector CRISPR DNA endonuclease discovered so far may need a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) flanking the guide RNA complimentary region of the target. For the DNA endonucleases discovered so far, the PAM motifs have at least 2 nucleotides of specificity, such as 2, 3, 4, 5 or more nucleotides of specificity, such as 2-4 or 2-5 nucleotides of specificity, which curtails the fraction of possible targets in the genome that can be cleaved with a single natural enzyme. Mutation of naturally occurring DNA endonucleases has resulted in protein variants with modified PAM specificities. Cumulatively, the more such variants exist for a given protein targeting different PAMs, the greater the density of genomic targets are available for use in therapeutic design (See population efficacy). Nucleotide content: Nucleotide content of PAMs can affect what fraction of the genome can be targeted with an individual protein due to differences in the abundance of a particular motif in the genome or in a specific therapeutic locus of the genome. Additionally, nucleotide content can affect PAM mutation frequencies in the genome (See population efficacy). Cpf1 proteins with altered PAM specificity can address this issue (as described further herein). Influence of PAM length/complexity on target specificity: Cas9 interrogates the genome by first binding to a PAM site before attempting to create a stable RNA/DNA duplex by melting the double stranded DNA. Since the complexity of the PAM limits the possible space of targets interrogated, a more complex PAM will have fewer possible sites at which off-target cleavage can occur. 6. crRNA Processing Capabilities of the Enzyme: Multiplexing: For multiplexing, crRNA processing capabilities are desirable, as a transcript expressed from a single promoter can contain multiple different crRNAs. This transcript is then processed into multiple constituent crRNAs by the protein, and multiplexed editing proceeds for each target specified by the crRNA. On the other hand, the rules for RNA endonucleolytic processing of multi crRNA transcripts into crRNAs are not fully understood. Hence, for therapeutic applications, crRNA processing may be undesirable due to off-target cleavage of endogenous RNA transcripts.Target Choice 1. Target Length: Although most protospacer elements observed in naturally occurring Cas9 and Cpf1 CRISPR arrays are longer than 20 nt, protospacer complimentary regions of resulting crRNA products are often processed to 20 nt (Cas9) or do not confer specificity beyond 20 nt (Cpf1). Extension of the target complimentary region of the guide RNA beyond 20 nt likely is positioned outside of the footprint of the protein on the guide RNA and is often processed away by exonucleases (See protected guide RNAs for further discussion).2. Efficiency Screening: Screening for CRISPR effector efficacy has been performed by studying the efficacy of knockdown of cell surface proteins using different DNA targets. These studies show some evidence that position dependent nucleotide content in CRISPR effector targets and flanking nucleotides affects the efficacy of target cleavage.3. Specificity Screening: Unbiased investigation of genome-wide CRISPR nuclease activity suggests that most off-target activity occurs at loci with at most three mismatches to the RNA guide. Current approaches for CRISPR effector target selection rank off-target candidates found in the reference human genome by both the number and position of RNA guide mismatches, with the assumption that loci containing less than 3 mismatches or containing PAM distal mismatches are more likely to be cleaved. However, in a population of individuals, this strategy is complicated by the existence of multiple haplotypes (sets of associated variants), which will contain different positions or numbers of mismatches at candidate off-target sites (See: population safety).Guide RNA Design Several technologies have been developed to address different aspects of efficacy and specificity1. Tru Guide: Trimming 1-3 nt off from the 3 end of the target complimentary region of the gRNA often decreases activity at off-target loci containing at least one mismatch to the guide RNA. Likely, with fewer nucleotides of base-pairing between the off-target and gRNA, each mismatch has a greater thermodynamic consequence to the stability of the CRISPR effector-gRNA complex with the off-target DNA. Percentage of successfully cleaved targets may be reduced in using tru guides: i.e., some sites that worked with a 20 nt guide may not cut efficiently with a 17 nt guide; but the ones that do work with 17 nt generally cleavage as efficiently.2. Protected Guide: Protected guides utilize an extended guide RNA and/or trans RNA/DNA elements to 1) create stable structures in the sgRNA that compete with sgRNA base-pairing at a target or off-target site or 2) (optionally) extend complimentary nucleotides between the gRNA and target. For extended RNA implementations, secondary structure results from complementarity between the 3 extension of the guide RNA and another target complimentary region of the guide RNA. For trans implementations, DNA or RNA elements bind the extended or normal length guide RNA partially obscuring the target complimentary region of the sgRNA.Dosage The dosage of the CRISPR components should take into account the following factors1. Target Search: CRISPR effector/guide RNA-enzyme complexes use to locate targets. Given equal genomic accessibility, the probability of the complex finding an off-target or on-target is similar.2. Binding (Target Dwell Time): Once located, the binding kinetics of the complex at an on-target or an off-target with few mismatches differs only slightly. Hence, target search and binding are likely not the rate-limiting steps for DNA cleavage at on-target or off-target loci. ChIP data suggests that complex dwell time does decrease accompanying increasing mismatches between the off-target locus and RNA guide, particularly in the PAM-proximal 'seed' region of the RNA guide.3. Cutting (Thermodynamic Barrier to Assuming an Active Conformation): A major rate-limiting step for CRISPR effector enzymatic activity appears to be configuration of the target DNA and guide RNA-protein complex in an active conformation for DNA cleavage. Increasing mismatches at off-target loci decrease the likelihood of the complex achieving an active conformation at off-target loci. The difference between binding and cutting is why ChIP has very low predictive power as a tool for evaluating the off-target cleavage of Cpf1. If the probability of finding an off-target or on-target is similar, then the difference in rate of on and off-target cleavage is likely due to the fact that the probability of cleavage at an on target sites is greater than off target sites. (See temporal control) The stochastic search means that Cpf1 suggests that an incorrect model is to view Cpf1 as preferentially cleaving the on-target site first and only moving onto off-target sites after on-target cleavage is saturated; instead, all sites are interrogated at random, and the probability of progression to cutting after PAM binding is what differentiates the propensity of on vs. off-target cutting.4. Repetition in DNA Modification at an Individual Locus: NHEJ repair of DNA double strand breaks is generally high fidelity (Should find exact error rate). Hence, it is likely that a nuclease may cut an individual locus many times before an error in NHEJ results in an indel at the cut site. The probability of observing an indel is the compounding probability of observing a double strand break based on 1) target search probability, 2) target dwell time, and 3) overcoming the thermodynamic barrier to DNA cleavage.5. Enzyme Concentration: Even at very low concentrations, search may still encounter an off-target prior to an on-target. Thereafter, the number and location of mismatches in an off-target, and likely the nucleotide content of the target will influence the likelihood of DNA cleavage. Thinking about on/off target cleavage in probabilistic terms, each interaction that Cas9 or Cpf1 has with the genome can be thought of as having some probability of successful cleavage. Reducing the dose will reduce the number of effector molecules available for interacting with the genome, and thus will limit the additive probability of repeated interactions at off-target sites.Temporal and Spatial Control of the Crispr System Various technologies have been developed which provide additional options for addressing efficacy, specificity and safety issues. More particularly these options can be used to allow for temporal control. More particularly these technologies allow for temporal/spatial control (as described further herein): 1. Double nickases 2. Escorted guides 3. Split-effector protein 4. \"self-inactivating\" systems or \"governing guides\" In the following, the different variables and how they influence the design of a CRISPR-based editing system are described in more detail.Specificity\u2014Select Specific Guide RNA a. Guide Specificity While early reports were fairly contradictory on the ability to accurately predict guide RNAs with limited off-target activity, statistical analysis based on a large number of data has made it possible to identify rules governing off-target effects. Doench et al. (Nat Biotechnol. 2016 February; 34(2):184-91) describe the profiling of the off-target activity of thousands of sgRNAs and the development of a metric to predict off-target sites. Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the methods of the invention involve selecting a guide RNA which, based on statistical analysis, is less likely to generate off-target effects. b. Guide Complementarity It is generally envisaged that the degree of complementarity between a guide sequence and its corresponding target sequence should be as high as possible, such as more than about 50%, embodiments, a particular concern is reducing off-target interactions, e.g., reducing the guide interacting with a target sequence having low complementarity. It has been shown that certain mutations result in the CRISPR-Cas system being able to distinguish between target and off-target sequences that have greater than 80% to e.g., 83%-84% or 88-89% or 94-95% complementarity (for instance, distinguishing between a target having 18 nucleotides from an off-target of 18 nucleotides having 1, 2 or 3 mismatches). Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the guide is selected such that the degree of complementarity between a guide sequence and its corresponding target sequence is greater than 94.5% or 95% or 95.5% or 96% or 99.5% or 99.9%, or 100%. Off target is less than 100% or 99.9% or 99.5% or 99% or 81% or 80% complementarity between the sequence and the guide, with it advantageous that off target is 100% or 99.9% or 99.5% or 99% or 95% or 94.5% complementarity between the sequence and the guide. c. Select Guide/Enzyme Concentration For minimization of toxicity and off-target effect, it will be important to control the concentration of Cpf1 protein and guide RNA delivered. Optimal concentrations of Cpf1 protein and guide RNA can be determined by testing different concentrations in a cellular or non-human eukaryote animal model and using deep sequencing the analyze the extent of modification at potential off-target genomic loci. For example, for the guide sequence targeting 5-GAGTCCGAGCAGAAGAAGAA-3 (SEQ ID NO: 44) in the EMX1 gene of the human genome, deep sequencing can be used to assess the level of modification at the following two off-target loci, 1: 5-GAGTCCTAGCAGGAGAAGAA-3 (SEQ ID NO: 45) and 2: 5-GAGTCTAAGCAGAAGAAGAA-3 (SEQ ID NO: 46). The concentration that gives the highest level of on-target modification while minimizing the level of off-target modification should be chosen for in vivo delivery.Specificity\u2014Select Specific Enzyme a. Enzyme Modifications to Enhance Specificity In particular embodiments, a reduction of off-target cleavage is ensured by destabilizing strand separation, more particularly by introducing mutations in the Cpf1 enzyme decreasing the positive charge in the DNA interacting regions (as described herein and further exemplified for Cas9 by Slaymaker et al. 2016 (Science, 1; 351(6268):84-8). In further embodiments, a reduction of off-target cleavage is ensured by introducing mutations into Cpf1 enzyme which affect the interaction between the target strand and the guide RNA sequence, more particularly disrupting interactions between Cpf1 and the phosphate backbone of the target DNA strand in such a way as to retain target specific activity but reduce off-target activity (as described for Cas9 by Kleinstiver et al. 2016, Nature, 28; 529(7587):490-5). In particular embodiments, the off-target activity is reduced by way of a modified Cpf1 wherein both interaction with target strand and non-target strand are modified compared to wild-type Cpf1. The methods and mutations which can be employed in various combinations to increase or decrease activity and/or specificity of on-target vs. off-target activity, or increase or decrease binding and/or specificity of on-target vs. off-target binding, can be used to compensate or enhance mutations or modifications made to promote other effects. Such mutations or modifications made to promote other effects include mutations or modification to the Cpf1 effector protein and or mutation or modification made to a guide RNA. With a similar strategy used to improve Cas9 specificity (Slaymaker et al. 2015 \"Rationally engineered Cas9 nucleases with improved specificity\"), specificity of Cpf1 can be improved by mutating residues that stabilize the non-targeted DNA strand. This may be accomplished without a crystal structure by using linear structure alignments to predict 1) which domain of Cpf1 binds to which strand of DNA and 2) which residues within these domains contact DNA. However, this approach may be limited due to poor conservation of Cpf1 with known proteins. Thus it may be desirable to probe the function of all likely DNA interacting amino acids (lysine, histidine and arginine). Positively charged residues in the RuvC domain are more conserved throughout Cpf1s than those in the Rad50 domain indicating that RuvC residues are less evolutionarily flexible. This suggests that rigid control of nucleic acid binding is needed in this domain (relative to the Rad50 domain). Therefore, it is possible this domain cuts the targeted DNA strand because of the requirement for RNA:DNA duplex stabilization (precedent in Cas9). Furthermore, more arginines are present in the RuvC domain (5% of RuvC residues 904 to 1307 vs 3.8% in the proposed Rad50 domains) suggesting again that RuvC targets one of the DNA strands. Arginines are more involved in binding nucleic acid major and minor grooves (Rohs Nature 2009: rohslab.cmb.usc.edu/Papers/Rohs_etal_Nature.pdf). Major/minor grooves would only be present in a duplex (such as DNA:RNA targeting duplex), further suggesting that RuvC may be involved in cutting. Based on the structural analysis of the RuvC and Rad50 domains, it can be deduced what the relevant domains look like in Cpf1, and infer which regions and residues may contact DNA. Accordingly, in certain embodiments the Cpf1 enzyme is modified by mutation of one or more residues (in the RuvC domain) including but not acid position numbering of AsCpf1 (Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6). Additionally or alternatively, in certain embodiments, the Cpf1 enzyme is modified by mutation of one or more residues (in the RAD50) domain including but not acid position numbering of AsCpf1 (Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6). From these specific observations about AsCpf1 similar residues can be identified in Cpf1 from other species by sequence alignments. In certain embodiments, the Cpf1 enzyme is modified by mutation of one or more residues including but not limited acid position numbering of AsCpf1 (Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6). In certain embodiments, the enzyme is modified by mutation of one or more residues including but not limited acid position numbering of LbCpf1 (Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006). b. Selecting Suitable PAM Recognition The requirement of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) of most CRISPR effector proteins, ensures another level of specificity in that only the target which is preceded by the relevant motif for the enzyme, will be cleaved. Thus, in particular embodiments, where available it may be of interest to select an effector protein with a stringent PAM so as to reduce off-target effects. Such an effector protein may be a Cpf1 ortholog or an effector protein having altered specificity. On the other hand, the use of a Cpf1 effector protein can be limited by its protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), in that it will only be able to robustly cleave target sites preceded by said motif. For instance, the Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6 Cpf1 (AsCpf1), which has been successfully harnessed for genome editing can only cleave target sites precede by a TTTV protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), which limits its practical utility. Where broad applicability may be needed for multiplexing, the selection of an effector protein with a different PAM specificity may be of interest. Again, this altered specificity may be found in a Cpf1 ortholog; However, it has been found that the Cpf1 effector protein can be mutated to modify its PAM specificity. Modification of PAM specificity has been performed by a structure-guided saturation mutagenesis screen to increase the targeting range of Cpf1 (Linyi et al. 2016, BioRxiv, dx.doi.org/10.1101/091611). Two variants of AsCpf1 were engineered with the mutations S542R/K607R and S542R/K548V/N552R that can cleave target sites with TYCV/CCCC and TATV PAMs, respectively, with enhanced activities in vitro and in human cells. Genome-wide assessment of off-target activity indicated that these variants retain a high level of DNA targeting specificity. It was found that by the provision of the additional AsCpf1 effector protein variants, this results in the addition of one cleavage site for every 8.7 bp in non-repetitive regions of the human genome. Further Cpf1 mutants are also envisaged herein. In particular embodiments, a mutated Cpf1 is used wherein said mutated Cpf1 comprises one or more mutated amino acid residue at position 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 34, 36, 39, 40, 43, 46, 47, 50, 54, 57, 58, 111, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 532, 533, 534, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 565, 566, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 575, 592, 593, 594, 595, 596, 597, 598, 599, 600, 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611, 612, 613, 614, 615, 616, 617, 618, 619, 620, 626, 627, 628, 629, 630, 631, 632, 633, 634, 635, 636, 638, 782, 783, 784, 785, 786, 871, 872, 873, 874, 875, 876, 877, 878, 879, 880, 881, 882, 883, 884, or 1048; preferably, one or more mutated amino acid residue at position 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550, 551, 552, 570, 571, 572, 573, 595, 596, 597, 598, 599, 600, 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 608, 609, 610, 611, 612, 613, 614, 615, 630, 631, 632, 646, 647, 649, 650, 688, 689, or 690; more preferably one or more mutated amino acid residue at position 539, 542, 547, 548, 550, 551, 552, 167, 604, and/or 607 of or the corresponding position of an AsCpf1 orthologue, homologue, or variant, preferably mutated amino acid residues at positions 542 or 542 and 607, wherein said mutations preferably are 542R and 607R, such as S542R and K607R; or preferably mutated amino acid residues at positions 542 and 548 (and optionally 552), wherein said mutations preferably are 542R 548V 552R), such as S542R (and optionally N552R); or at position 532, 538, 542, and/or 595 of LbCpf1, or the corresponding position of an AsCpf1 orthologue, homologue, or variant, preferably mutated amino acid residues at positions 532 or 532 and 595, wherein said mutations preferably are 532R and 595R, such as G532R and K595R; or preferably mutated amino acid residues at positions 532 and 538 (and optionally 542), wherein said mutations preferably are 532R and 538V (and optionally 542R), such (and optionally Y542R). Accordingly, these variants increase the targeting range, providing a useful addition to the CRISPR/Cas genome engineering toolbox. At the same time, the provision of Cpf1 effector proteins with alternative PAM specificity allows for the selection of a particular variant with optimal specificity for a particular target sequence.System Approaches to Reduce Off-Target Effects: a. Double Nickase Alternatively, to minimize the level of toxicity and off-target effect, a Cpf1 nickase can be used with a pair of guide RNAs targeting a site of interest. Guide sequences and strategies to minimize toxicity and off-target effects can be as in WO 2014/093622 (PCT/US2013/074667); or, via mutation as described herein. The invention thus contemplates methods of using two or more nickases, in particular a dual or double nickase approach. In some aspects and embodiments, a single type FnCpf1, AsCpf1 or LbCpf1 nickase may be delivered, for example a modified FnCpf1, AsCpf1 or LbCpf1 or a modified FnCpf1, AsCpf1 or LbCpf1 nickase as described herein. This results in the target DNA being bound by two FnCpf1 nickases. In addition, it is also envisaged that different orthologs may be used, e.g., an FnCpf1, AsCpf1 or LbCpf1 nickase on one strand (e.g., the coding strand) of the DNA and an ortholog on the non-coding or opposite DNA strand. The ortholog can be, but is not limited to, a Cpf1 nickase such as a AsCpf1 nickase or a LbCpf1 nickase or FnCpf1 nickase. It may be advantageous to use two different orthologs that need different PAMs and may also have different guide requirements, thus allowing a greater deal of control for the user. In certain embodiments, DNA cleavage will involve at least four types of nickases, wherein each type is guided to a different sequence of target DNA, wherein each pair introduces a first nick into one DNA strand and the second introduces a nick into the second DNA strand. In such methods, at least two pairs of single stranded breaks are introduced into the target DNA wherein upon introduction of first and second pairs of single-strand breaks, target sequences between the first and second pairs of single-strand breaks are excised. In certain embodiments, one or both of the orthologs is controllable, i.e. inducible. b. Escorted Guides The methods provided herein may also involve the use of escorted Cpf1 CRISPR-Cas systems or complexes, especially such a system involving an escorted Cpf1 CRISPR-Cas system guide. By \"escorted\" is meant that the Cpf1 CRISPR-Cas system or complex or guide is delivered to a selected time or place within a cell, so that activity of the Cpf1 CRISPR-Cas system or complex or guide is spatially or temporally controlled. For example, the activity and destination of the Cpf1 CRISPR-Cas system or complex or guide may be controlled by an escort RNA aptamer sequence that has binding affinity for an aptamer ligand, such as a cell surface protein or other localized cellular component. Alternatively, the escort aptamer may for example be responsive to an aptamer effector on or in the cell, such as a transient effector, such as an external energy source that is applied to the cell at a particular time. The principle of escorted guides and embodiments thereof are described in detail in WO2016094874 incorporated by reference herein. Aptamers are biomolecules that can be designed or selected to bind tightly to other ligands, for example using a technique called systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX; Tuerk C, Gold L: \"Systematic Science 1990, 249:505-510). Nucleic acid aptamers can for example be selected from pools of random-sequence oligonucleotides, with high binding affinities and specificities for a wide range of biomedically relevant targets, suggesting a wide range of therapeutic utilities for aptamers (Keefe, Anthony D., Supriya Pai, and Andrew Ellington. \"Aptamers as therapeutics.\" Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 9.7 (2010): 537-550). These characteristics also suggest a wide range of uses for aptamers as drug delivery vehicles (Levy-Nissenbaum, Etgar, et al. \"Nanotechnology and aptamers: applications in drug delivery.\" Trends in biotechnology 26.8 (2008): 442-449; and, Hicke B J, Stephens A W. \"Escort aptamers: a delivery service for diagnosis and therapy.\" J Clin Invest 2000, 106:923-928.). Aptamers may also be constructed that function as molecular switches, responding to a que by changing properties, such as RNA aptamers that bind fluorophores to mimic the activity of green fluorescent protein (Paige, Jeremy S., Karen Y. Wu, and Samie R. Jaffrey. mimics of green fluorescent protein.\" Science (2011): 642-646). It has also been suggested that aptamers may be used as components of targeted siRNA therapeutic delivery systems, for example targeting cell surface proteins (Zhou, Jiehua, and John J. Rossi. \"Aptamer-targeted cell-specific RNA interference.\" Silence 1.1 (2010): 4). The aptamers used in this aspect are designed to improve gRNA delivery, including delivery across the cellular membrane, to intracellular compartments, or into the nucleus. Such a structure can include, either in addition to the one or more aptamer(s) or without such one or more aptamer(s), moiety(ies) so as to render the guide deliverable, inducible or responsive to a selected effector. In particular embodiments, a gRNA is designed that responds to normal or pathological physiological conditions, including without limitation pH, hypoxia, 02 concentration, temperature, protein concentration, enzymatic concentration, lipid structure, light exposure, mechanical disruption (e.g. ultrasound waves), magnetic fields, electric fields, or electromagnetic radiation. Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the escort aptamer has binding affinity for an aptamer ligand on or in the cell, or the escort aptamer is responsive to a localized aptamer effector on or in the cell, wherein the presence of the aptamer ligand or effector on or in the cell is spatially or temporally restricted. Once intended alterations have been introduced, such as by editing intended copies of a gene in the genome of a cell, continued CRISRP/Cpf1 expression in that cell is no longer necessary. Indeed, sustained expression would be undesirable in certain cases in case of off-target effects at unintended genomic sites, etc. Thus time-limited expression is of interest. Inducible expression offers one approach, but in addition Applicants have engineered a Self-Inactivating Cpf1 CRISPR-Cas system that relies on the use of a non-coding guide target sequence within the CRISPR vector itself. Thus, after expression begins, the CRISPR system will lead to its own destruction, but before destruction is complete it will have time to edit the genomic copies of the target gene (which, with a normal point mutation in a diploid cell, may need at most two edits). Simply, the self-inactivating Cpf1 CRISPR-Cas system includes additional RNA (i.e., guide RNA) that targets the coding sequence for the CRISPR enzyme itself or that targets one or more non-coding guide target sequences complementary to unique sequences present in one or more of the following: (a) within the promoter driving expression of the non-coding RNA elements, (b) within the promoter driving expression of the Cpf1 gene, (c) within 100 bp of the ATG translational start codon in the Cpf1 coding sequence, (d) within the inverted terminal repeat (iTR) of a viral delivery vector, e.g., in an AAV genome. Examples of inducible systems are light responsive systems. Light responsiveness of an inducible system are achieved via the activation and binding of cryptochrome-2 and CIB1. Blue light stimulation induces an activating conformational change in cryptochrome-2, resulting in recruitment of its binding partner CIB1. This binding is fast and reversible, achieving saturation in <15 sec following pulsed stimulation and returning to baseline <15 min after the end of stimulation. These rapid binding kinetics result in a system temporally bound only by the speed of transcription/translation and transcript/protein degradation, rather than uptake and clearance of inducing agents. Crytochrome-2 activation is also highly sensitive, allowing for the use of low light intensity stimulation and mitigating the risks of phototoxicity. Further, in a context such as the intact mammalian brain, variable light intensity may be used to control the size of a stimulated region, allowing for greater precision than vector delivery alone may offer. In particular embodiments, energy sources such as electromagnetic radiation, sound energy or thermal energy can induce the guide. Advantageously, the electromagnetic radiation is a component of visible light. In a preferred embodiment, the light is a blue light with a wavelength of about 450 to about 495 nm. In an especially preferred embodiment, the wavelength is about 488 nm. In another preferred embodiment, the light stimulation is via pulses. The light power may range from about 0-9 mW/cm2. In a preferred embodiment, a stimulation paradigm of as low as 0.25 sec every 15 sec should result in maximal activation. In particular embodiments, the system is chemically inducible. Exemplary designs of chemical inducible systems include: 1. ABI-PYL based system inducible by Abscisic Acid (ABA) (see, e.g., stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sigtrans;4/164/rs2), 2. FKBP-FRB based system inducible by rapamycin (or related chemicals based on rapamycin) (see, e.g., www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v2/n6/full/nmeth763.html), 3. GID1-GAI based system inducible by Gibberellin (GA) (see, e.g., www.nature.com/nchembio/journal/v8/n5/full/nchembio.922.html). Another chemical inducible system is an estrogen receptor (ER) based system inducible by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) (see, e.g., www.pnas.org/content/104/3/1027.abstract). A mutated ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor called ERT2 translocates into the nucleus of cells upon binding of 4-hydroxytamoxifen. In further embodiments of the invention any naturally occurring or engineered derivative of any nuclear receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, retinoic acid receptor, estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, progesterone receptor, androgen receptor may be used in inducible systems analogous to the ER based inducible system. In particular embodiments, the chemical inducible system is based on change in sub-cellular localization. The polypeptide can include a DNA binding domain comprising at least five or more Transcription activator-like effector (TALE) monomers and at least one or more half-monomers specifically ordered to target the genomic locus of interest linked to at least one or more effector domains are further linker to a chemical or energy sensitive protein. This protein will lead to a change in the sub-cellular localization of the entire polypeptide (i.e. transportation of the entire polypeptide from cytoplasm into the nucleus of the cells) upon the binding of a chemical or energy transfer to the chemical or energy sensitive protein. This transportation of the entire polypeptide from one sub-cellular compartments or organelles, in which its activity is sequestered due to lack of substrate for the effector domain, into another one in which the substrate is present would allow the entire polypeptide to come in contact with its desired substrate (i.e. genomic DNA in the mammalian nucleus) and result in activation or repression of target gene expression. Another inducible system is based on the design using Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel based system inducible by energy, heat or radio-wave (see, e.g., www.sciencemag.org/content/336/6081/604). These TRP family proteins respond to different stimuli, including light and heat. When this protein is activated by light or heat, the ion channel will open and allow the entering of ions such as calcium into the plasma membrane. This influx of ions will bind to intracellular ion interacting partners linked to a polypeptide including the guide and the other components of the Cpf1 CRISPR-Cas complex or system, and the binding will induce the change of sub-cellular localization of the polypeptide, leading to the entire polypeptide entering the nucleus of cells. Once inside the nucleus, the guide protein and the other components of the Cpf1 CRISPR-Cas complex will be active and modulating target gene expression in cells. This type of system could also be used to induce the cleavage of a genomic locus of interest in a cell; and, in this regard, it is noted that the Cpf1 enzyme is a nuclease. The light could be generated with a laser or other forms of energy sources. The heat could be generated by raise of temperature results from an energy source, or from nano-particles that release heat after absorbing energy from an energy source delivered in the form of radio-wave. Photoinducibility provides the potential for spatial precision. Taking advantage of the development of optrode technology, a stimulating fiber optic lead may be placed in a precise brain region. Stimulation region size may then be tuned by light intensity. This may be done in conjunction with the delivery of the Cpf1 CRISPR-Cas system or complex of the invention, or, in the case of transgenic Cpf1 animals, guide RNA of the invention may be delivered and the optrode technology can allow for the modulation of gene expression in precise brain regions. A culture medium for culturing host cells includes a medium commonly used for tissue culture, such as M199-earle Suitable culture media for specific cell types may be found at the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) or the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC). Culture media may be supplemented with amino acids such as L-glutamine, salts, anti-fungal or anti-bacterial agents such as Fungizone\u00ae, penicillin-streptomycin, animal serum, and the like. The cell culture medium may optionally be serum-free. Temporal precision can also be achieved in vivo. This may be used to alter gene expression during a particular stage of development. This may be used to time a genetic cue to a particular experimental window. For example, genes implicated in learning may be overexpressed or repressed only during the learning stimulus in a precise region of the intact rodent or primate brain. Further, the invention may be used to induce gene expression changes only during particular stages of disease development. For example, an oncogene may be overexpressed only once a tumor reaches a particular size or metastatic stage. Conversely, proteins suspected in the development of Alzheimer's may be knocked down only at defined time points in the animal's life and within a particular brain region. Although these examples do not exhaustively list the potential applications of the invention, they highlight some of the areas in which the invention may be a powerful technology.(c) Protected Guide RNAs In one aspect, it is of interest to further enhance the specificity of Cpf1 given individual guide RNAs through thermodynamic tuning of the binding specificity of the guide RNA to target DNA. This is a general approach of introducing mismatches, elongation or truncation of the guide sequence to increase/decrease the number of complimentary bases vs. mismatched bases shared between a genomic target and its potential off-target loci, in order to give thermodynamic advantage to targeted genomic loci over genomic off-targets. Thus it can be of interest to modify the guide sequence by secondary structure to increase the specificity of the Cpf1 CRISPR-Cas system whereby the secondary structure can protect against exonuclease activity. This can be ensured by hybridizing a \"protector RNA\" to a guide sequence, wherein the \"protector RNA\" is an RNA strand complementary to the 5 end of the guide RNA (gRNA), to thereby generate a partially double-stranded gRNA. Protecting the mismatched bases with a perfectly complementary protector sequence decreases the likelihood of target DNA binding to the mismatched basepairs at the 3 end. In particular embodiments, additional sequences comprising an extended length may also be present. The principle of using protected guide RNAs is described in detail in WO/2016/094867, which is incorporated herein by reference. Guide RNA (gRNA) extensions matching the genomic target provide gRNA protection and enhance specificity. Extension of the gRNA with matching sequence distal to the end of the spacer seed for individual genomic targets thus provides enhanced specificity. In particular embodiments, stable forms arise from protective states, where the extension forms a closed loop with the gRNA seed due to complimentary sequences in the spacer extension and the spacer seed. Thus, the protected guide concept also includes sequences matching the genomic target sequence distal of the 20mer spacer-binding region. Thermodynamic prediction can be used to predict completely matching or partially matching guide extensions that result in protected gRNA states as described in WO/2016/094867. An extension sequence which corresponds to the extended length (E\u00d7L) may optionally be attached directly to the guide sequence at the 3 end of the protected guide sequence. The extension sequence may be 2 to 12 nucleotides in length. Preferably E\u00d7L may be denoted as 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 nucleotides in length. In a preferred embodiment the ExL is denoted as 0 or 4 nucleotides in length. In a more preferred embodiment the ExL is 4 nucleotides in length. The extension sequence may or may not be complementary to the target sequence. An extension sequence may further optionally be attached directly to the guide sequence at the 5 end of the protected guide sequence as well as to the 3 end of a protecting sequence. As a result, the extension sequence serves as a linking sequence between the protected sequence and the protecting sequence. Without wishing to be bound by theory, such a link may position the protecting sequence near the protected sequence for improved binding of the protecting sequence to the protected sequence.(d) Formation of a RISC Through Guide Engineering In some embodiments, the guide may be a protected guide (e.g. a pgRNA) or an escorted guide (e.g. an esgRNA) as described herein. Both of these, in some embodiments, make use of RISC. A RISC is a key component of RNAi. RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) is a multiprotein, specifically a ribonucleoprotein, complex which incorporates one strand of a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) fragment, such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA), which acts as a template for RISC to recognize a complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript. The mRNA is thus cleaved by one of the components of the RISC. As such, the formation of a RISC is advantageous in some embodiments. Guide RNAs according to various aspects of the present invention, including but not limited to protected and/or escorted guide RNAs, may be adapted to include RNA nucleotides that promote formation of a RISC, for example in combination with an siRNA or miRNA that may be provided or may, for instance, already be expressed in a cell. This may be useful, for instance, as a self-inactivating system to clear or degrade the guide. Thus, the guide RNA may comprise a sequence complementary to a target miRNA or an siRNA, which may or may not be present within a cell. In this way, only when the miRNA or siRNA is present, for example through expression (by the cell or through human intervention), is there binding of the RNA sequence to the miRNA or siRNA which then results in cleavage of the guide RNA an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) within the cell. Therefore, in some embodiments, the guide RNA comprises an RNA sequence complementary to a target miRNA or siRNA, and binding of the guide RNA sequence to the target miRNA or siRNA results in cleavage of the guide RNA by an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) within the cell. RISC formation through use of escorted guides is described in W2016094874, RISC formation through use of protected guides is described in WO/2016/094867.(e) Use of Inducible Systems In some embodiments, a CRISPR enzyme may form a component of an inducible system. The inducible nature of the system would allow for spatiotemporal control of gene editing or gene expression using a form of energy. The form of energy may include but is not limited to electromagnetic radiation, sound energy, chemical energy and thermal energy. Examples of inducible system include tetracycline inducible promoters (Tet-On or Tet-Off), small molecule two-hybrid transcription systems (FKBP, ABA, etc), or light inducible systems (Phytochrome, LOV domains, or cryptochrome). In one embodiment, the CRISPR enzyme may be a part of a Light Inducible Transcriptional Effector (LITE) to direct changes in transcriptional activity in a sequence-specific manner. The components of a light may include a CRISPR enzyme, a light-responsive transcriptional activation/repression domain. Further examples of inducible DNA binding proteins and methods for their use are provided in U.S. 61/736,465 and U.S. 61/721,283, and WO 2014/018423 A2 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.(f) Use of Inducible/Split Effector Enzymes In an aspect the invention provides a (non-naturally occurring or engineered) inducible CRISPR protein according to the invention as described herein (CRISPR-Cas system), comprising: a first CRISPR protein fusion construct attached to a first half of an inducible dimer and a second CRISPR protein fusion construct attached to a second half of the inducible dimer, wherein the first Cpf1 fusion construct is operably linked to one or more nuclear localization signals, wherein the second CRISPR protein fusion construct is operably linked to one or more nuclear export signals, wherein contact with an inducer energy source brings the first and second halves of the inducible dimer together, wherein bringing the first and second halves of the inducible dimer together allows the first and second CRISPR protein fusion constructs to constitute a functional CRISPR protein (optionally wherein the CRISPR-Cas system comprises a guide RNA (gRNA) comprising a guide sequence capable of hybridizing to a target sequence in a genomic locus of interest in a cell, and wherein the functional CRISPR-Cas system binds to the target sequence and, optionally, edits the genomic locus to alter gene expression). In an aspect of the invention in the inducible CRISPR-Cas system, the inducible dimer is or comprises or consists essentially of or consists of an inducible heterodimer. In an aspect, in inducible CRISPR-Cas system, the first half or a first portion or a first fragment of the inducible heterodimer is or comprises or consists of or consists essentially of an FKBP, optionally FKBP12. In an aspect of the invention, in the inducible CRISPR-Cas system, the second half or a second portion or a second fragment of the inducible heterodimer is or comprises or consists of or consists essentially of FRB. In an aspect of the invention, in the inducible CRISPR-Cas system, the arrangement of the first CRISPR fusion construct is or comprises or consists of or consists essentially of N terminal CRISPR part-FRB-NES. In an aspect of the invention, in the inducible CRISPR-Cas system, the arrangement of the first CRISP fusion construct is or comprises or consists of or consists essentially of NES-N terminal CRISP part-FRB-NES. In an aspect of the invention, in the inducible CRISPR-Cas system, the arrangement of the second CRISP fusion construct is or comprises or consists essentially of or consists of C terminal CRISP part-FKBP-NLS. In an aspect the invention provides in the inducible Cpf1 CRISPR-Cas system, the arrangement of the second CRISP fusion construct is or comprises or consists of or consists essentially of NLS-C terminal CRISP part-FKBP-NLS. In an aspect, in inducible CRISPR-Cas system there can be a linker that separates the CRISP part from the half or portion or fragment of the inducible dimer. In an aspect, in the inducible CRISPR-Cas system, the inducer energy source is or comprises or consists essentially of or consists of rapamycin. In an aspect, in inducible CRISPR-Cas system, the inducible dimer is an aspect, the Cpf1 is AsCpf1, LbCpf1 or FnCpf1. In an aspect, the invention provides a (non-naturally occurring or engineered) inducible CRISPR-Cas system, comprising: a first CRISPR fusion construct attached to a first half of an inducible heterodimer and a second CRISPR fusion construct attached to a second half of the inducible heterodimer, wherein the first CRISPR fusion construct is operably linked to one or more nuclear localization signals, wherein the second CRISPR fusion construct is operably linked to a nuclear export signal, wherein contact with an inducer energy source brings the first and second halves of the inducible heterodimer together, wherein bringing the first and second halves of the inducible heterodimer together allows the first and second CRISPR fusion constructs to constitute a functional CRISPR (optionally wherein the CRISPR-Cas system comprises a guide RNA (gRNA) comprising a guide sequence capable of hybridizing to a target sequence in a genomic locus of interest in a cell, and wherein the functional CRISPR-Cas system edits the genomic locus to alter gene expression). Accordingly, the invention comprehends inter alia homodimers as well as heterodimers, dead-CRISPR or CRISPR protein having essentially no nuclease activity, e.g., through mutation, systems or complexes wherein there is one or more NLS and/or one or more NES; functional domain(s) linked to split Cas9; methods, including methods of treatment, and uses. An inducer energy source may be considered to be simply an inducer or a dimerizing agent. The term 'inducer energy source' is used herein throughout for consistency. The inducer energy source (or inducer) acts to reconstitute the enzyme. In some embodiments, the inducer energy source brings the two parts of the enzyme together through the action of the two halves of the inducible dimer. The two halves of the inducible dimer therefore are brought tougher in the presence of the inducer energy source. The two halves of the dimer will not form into the dimer (dimerize) without the inducer energy source. Thus, the two halves of the inducible dimer cooperate with the inducer energy source to dimerize the dimer. This in turn reconstitutes the CRISPR by bringing the first and second parts of the CRISPR together. The CRISPR protein fusion constructs each comprise one part of the split CRISPR protein. These are fused, preferably via a linker such as a GlySer linker described herein, to one of the two halves of the dimer. The two halves of the dimer may be substantially the same two monomers that together that form the homodimer, or they may be different monomers that together form the heterodimer. As such, the two monomers can be thought of as one half of the full dimer. The CRISPR protein is split in the sense that the two parts of the CRISPR protein enzyme substantially comprise a functioning CRISPR protein. That CRISPR protein may function as a genome editing enzyme (when forming a complex with the target DNA and the guide), such as a nickase or a nuclease (cleaving both strands of the DNA), or it may be a dead-CRISPR protein which is essentially a DNA-binding protein with very little or no catalytic activity, due to typically mutation(s) in its catalytic domains. The two parts of the split CRISPR protein can be thought of as the N terminal part and the C terminal part of the split CRISPR protein. The fusion is typically at the split point of the CRISPR protein. In other words, the C terminal of the N terminal part of the split CRISPR protein is fused to one of the dimer halves, whilst the N terminal of the C terminal part is fused to the other dimer half. The CRISPR protein does not have to be split in the sense that the break is newly created. The split point is typically designed in silico and cloned into the constructs. Together, the two parts of the split CRISPR protein, the N terminal and C terminal parts, form a full CRISPR protein, comprising preferably at least 70% or more of the wildtype amino acids (or nucleotides encoding them), preferably at least 80% or more, preferably at least 90% or more, preferably at least 95% or more, and preferably at least 99% or more of the wildtype amino acids (or nucleotides encoding them). Some trimming may be possible, and mutants are envisaged. Non-functional domains may be removed entirely. What is important is that the two parts may be brought together and that the desired CRISPR protein function is restored or reconstituted. The dimer may be a homodimer or a heterodimer. One or more, preferably two, NLSs may be used in operable linkage to the first CRISPR protein construct. One or more, preferably two, NESs may be used in operable linkage to the first Cpf1 construct. The NLSs and/or the NESs preferably flank the split Cpf1-dimer (i.e., half dimer) fusion, i.e., one NLS may be positioned at the N terminal of the first CRISPR protein construct and one NLS may be at the C terminal of the first CRISPR protein construct. Similarly, one NES may be positioned at the N terminal of the second CRISPR construct and one NES may be at the C terminal of the second CRISPR construct. Where reference is made to N or C terminals, it will be appreciated that these correspond to 5 ad 3 ends in the corresponding nucleotide sequence. A preferred arrangement is that the first CRISPR protein construct is arranged 5-NLS-(N terminal CRISPR protein part)-linker-(first half of the dimer)-NLS-3. A preferred arrangement is that the second CRISPR protein construct is arranged 5-NES-(second half of the dimer)-linker-(C terminal CRISPR protein part)-NES-3. A suitable promoter is preferably upstream of each of these constructs. The two constructs may be delivered separately or together. In some embodiments, one or all of the NES(s) in operable linkage to the second CPf1 construct may be swapped out for an NLS. However, this may be typically not preferred and, in other embodiments, the localization signal in operable linkage to the second Cpf1 construct is one or more NES(s). It will also be appreciated that the NES may be operably linked to the N terminal fragment of the split CRISPR protein and that the NLS may be operably linked to the C terminal fragment of the split CRISPR protein. However, the arrangement where the NLS is operably linked to the N terminal fragment of the split Cpf1 and that the NES is operably linked to the C terminal fragment of the split CRISPR protein may be preferred. The NES functions to localize the second CRISPR protein fusion construct outside of the nucleus, at least until the inducer energy source is provided (e.g., at least until an energy source is provided to the inducer to perform its function). The presence of the inducer stimulates dimerization of the two CRISPR protein fusions within the cytoplasm and makes it thermodynamically worthwhile for the dimerized, first and second, CRISPR protein fusions to localize to the nucleus. Without being bound by theory, Applicants believe that the NES sequesters the second CRISPR protein fusion to the cytoplasm (i.e., outside of the nucleus). The NLS on the first CRISPR protein fusion localizes it to the nucleus. In both cases, Applicants use the NES or NLS to shift an equilibrium (the equilibrium of nuclear transport) to a desired direction. The dimerization typically occurs outside of the nucleus (a very small fraction might happen in the nucleus) and the NLSs on the dimerized complex shift the equilibrium of nuclear transport to nuclear localization, so the dimerized and hence reconstituted CRISPR protein enters the nucleus. Beneficially, Applicants are able to reconstitute function in the split CRISPR protein. Transient transfection is used to prove the concept and dimerization occurs in the background in the presence of the inducer energy source. No activity is seen with separate fragments of the CRISPR protein. Stable expression through lentiviral delivery is then used to develop this and show that a split CRISPR protein approach can be used. This present split CRISPR protein approach is beneficial as it allows the CRISPR protein activity to be inducible, thus allowing for temporal control. Furthermore, different localization sequences may be used (i.e., the NES and NLS as preferred) to reduce background activity from auto-assembled complexes. Tissue specific promoters, for example one for each of the first and second CRISPR protein fusion constructs, may also be used for tissue-specific targeting, thus providing spatial control. Two different tissue specific promoters may be used to exert a finer degree of control if required. The same approach may be used in respect of stage-specific promoters or there may a mixture of stage and tissue specific promoters, where one of the first and second Cpf1 fusion constructs is under the control of (i.e. operably linked to or comprises) a tissue-specific promoter, whilst the other of the first and second Cpf1 fusion constructs is under the control of (i.e. operably linked to or comprises) a stage-specific promoter. The inducible CRISPR protein CRISPR-Cas system comprises one or more nuclear localization sequences (NLSs), as described herein, for example as operably linked to the first CRISPR protein fusion construct. These nuclear localization sequences are ideally of sufficient strength to drive accumulation of said first CRISPR protein fusion construct in a detectable amount in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that a nuclear localization sequence is not necessary for CRISPR-Cas complex activity in eukaryotes, but that including such sequences enhances activity of the system, especially as to targeting nucleic acid molecules in the nucleus, and assists with the operation of the present 2-part system. Equally, the second CRISPR protein fusion construct is operably linked to a nuclear export sequence (NES). Indeed, it may be linked to one or more nuclear export sequences. In other words, the number of export sequences used with the second CRISPR protein fusion construct is preferably 1 or 2 or 3. Typically 2 is preferred, but 1 is enough and so is preferred in some embodiments. Suitable examples of NLS and NES are known in the art. For example, a preferred nuclear export signal (NES) is human protein tyrosin kinase 2. Preferred signals will be species specific. Where the FRB and FKBP system are used, the FKBP is preferably flanked by nuclear localization sequences (NLSs). Where the FRB and FKBP system are used, the preferred arrangement is N terminal CRISPR protein-FRB-NES: C terminal Cpf1-FKBP-NLS. Thus, the first CRISPR protein fusion construct would comprise the C terminal CRISPR protein part and the second CRISPR protein fusion construct would comprise the N terminal CRISPR protein part. Another beneficial aspect to the present invention is that it may be turned on quickly, i.e. that is has a rapid response. It is believed, without being bound by theory, that CRISPR protein activity can be induced through dimerization of existing (already present) fusion constructs (through contact with the inducer energy source) more rapidly than through the expression (especially translation) of new fusion constructs. As such, the first and second CRISPR protein fusion constructs may be expressed in the target cell ahead of time, i.e. before CRISPR protein activity is required. CRISPR protein activity can then be temporally controlled and then quickly constituted through addition of the inducer energy source, which ideally acts more quickly (to dimerize the heterodimer and thereby provide CRISPR protein activity) than through expression (including induction of transcription) of CRISPR protein delivered by a vector, for example. Applicants demonstrate that CRISPR protein can be split into two components, which reconstitute a functional nuclease when brought back together. Employing rapamycin sensitive dimerization domains, Applicants generate a chemically inducible CRISPR protein for temporal control of CRISPR protein-mediated genome editing and transcription modulation. Put another way, Applicants demonstrate that CRISPR protein can be rendered chemically inducible by being split into two fragments and that rapamycin-sensitive dimerization domains may be used for controlled reassembly of the CRISPR protein. Applicants show that the re-assembled CRISPR protein may be used to mediate genome editing (through nuclease/nickase activity) as well as transcription modulation (as a DNA-binding domain, the so-called \"dead CRISPR protein\"). As such, the use of rapamycin-sensitive dimerization domains is preferred. Reassembly of the CRISPR protein is preferred. Reassembly can be determined by restoration of binding activity. Where the CRISPR protein is a nickase or induces a double-strand break, suitable comparison percentages compared to a wildtype are described herein. Rapamycin treatments can last 12 days. The dose can be 200 nM. This temporal and/or molar dosage is an example of an appropriate dose for Human embryonic kidney 293FT (HEK293FT) cell lines and this may also be used in other cell lines. This figure can be extrapolated out for therapeutic use in vivo into, for example, mg/kg. However, it is also envisaged that the standard dosage for administering rapamycin to a subject is used here as well. By the \"standard dosage\", it is meant the dosage under rapamycin's normal therapeutic use or primary indication (i.e. the dose used when rapamycin is administered for use to prevent organ rejection). It is noteworthy that the preferred arrangement of CRISPR protein-FRB/FKBP pieces are separate and inactive until rapamycin-induced dimerization of FRB and FKBP of a functional full-length CRISPR protein nuclease. Thus, it is preferred that first CRISPR protein fusion construct attached to a first half of an inducible heterodimer is delivered separately and/or is localized separately from the second Cpf1 fusion construct attached to a first half of an inducible heterodimer. To sequester the CRISPR protein (N)-FRB fragment in the cytoplasm, where it is less likely to dimerize with the nuclear-localized Cpf1(C)-FKBP fragment, it is preferable to use on CRISPR protein (N)-FRB a single nuclear export sequence (NES) from the human protein tyrosin kinase 2 (CRISPR protein (N)\u2014FRB-NES). In CRISPR protein (C)-FKBP-2\u00d7NLS to reconstitute a complete CRISPR protein, which shifts the balance of nuclear trafficking toward nuclear import and allows DNA targeting. In some aspects or embodiments, an inducible system for providing a CRISPR protein may be used. In some embodiments, the CRISPR protein is capable, in the presence of an inducer energy source, of forming a CRISPR complex with a target sequence and polynucleotides engineered to complex with the CRISPR protein and the target sequence. In some embodiments, the inducible system comprises: a first fusion protein, or polynucleotides encoding it; and a second fusion protein, or polynucleotides encoding it. In some embodiments, the first fusion protein comprises a first portion of the CRISPR protein, a first half of an inducible dimer and one or more Nuclear Localisation Sequences (NLS); and the second fusion protein comprises a second portion of the CRISPR protein, a second half of the inducible dimer and one or more Nuclear Export Sequences (NES). In some embodiments, contact with the inducer energy source brings the first and second portions of the inducible dimer together, so as to bring the first and second portions of the CRISPR protein together, such that the CRISPR protein is thereby capable of forming the CRISPR complex. In some embodiments, the CRISPR protein or the CRISPR system is inducible. In some embodiments, the CRISPR protein may be provided as a single 'part.' In some embodiments, delivery of the CRISPR protein is in protein (including in RNP complex with the polynucleotides) or in nucleotide form (including in mRNA form). In some embodiments, polynucleotides encoding the first fusion protein and polynucleotides encoding second fusion protein are provided on same or different constructs. WO2015/089427 describes an inducible CRISPR-Cas system based on an inducible dimer, which can be a homodimer or heterodimer. The system is also described in Zetsche et al. (Nature Biotechnology 33: 139-142 (2015) DOI: doi:10.1038/nbt.3149). Basically, the CRISPR effector protein is split into two parts, each of which is fused to one half of an inducible dimer, whereby contact with an inducer energy source brings the first and second halves of the inducible dimer together, and bringing the first and second halves of the inducible dimer together allows the first and second CRISPR effector fusion constructs to constitute a functional CRISPR-Cas system, wherein the CRISPR-Cas system comprises a guide RNA (gRNA) comprising a guide sequence capable of hybridizing to a target sequence in a genomic locus of interest in a cell, and wherein the functional CRISPR-Cas system binds to the genomic locus. In particular embodiments, the functional CRISPR-Cas system edits the genomic locus to alter gene expression. In particular embodiments the first half is an FKBP and the second half is an FRB. An inducer energy source may be considered to be simply an inducer or a dimerizing agent as it acts to reconstitute the CRISPR effector protein. Examples of inducers include light and hormones. A preferred example of first and second light-inducible dimer halves is the CIB1 and CRY2 system. The CIB1 domain is a heterodimeric binding partner of the light-sensitive Cryptochrome 2 (CRY2). In another example, the blue light-responsive Magnet dimerization system (pMag and nMag) may be fused to the two parts of a split Cpf1 protein. In response to light stimulation, pMag and nMag dimerize and Cpf1 reassembles. For example, such system is described in connection with Cas9 in Nihongaki et al. (Nat. Biotechnol. 33, 755-790, 2015). The inducer energy source may be heat, ultrasound, electromagnetic energy or chemical. In a preferred embodiment the inducer energy source may be an antibiotic, a small molecule, a hormone, a hormone derivative, a steroid or a steroid derivative. In a more preferred embodiment, the inducer energy source may be rapamycin, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT), estrogen or ecdysone. The at least one switch may be selected from the group consisting of antibiotic based inducible systems, electromagnetic energy based inducible systems, small molecule based inducible systems, nuclear receptor based inducible systems and hormone based inducible systems. In a more preferred embodiment the at least one switch may be selected from the group consisting of tetracycline (Tet)/DOX inducible systems, light Such are also discussed herein and in PCT/US2013/051418, incorporated herein by reference. Also, it is described in WO2015/089427 that the half of an inducible dimer can be linked to the effector protein with a linker. Optionally, the CRISPR effector protein has reduced or no nuclease activity, e.g. contains one or more inactivating mutations. Further it is described that one or more functional domains can be associated with one or both parts of the effector protein, WO2015/089427 identifies split points within SpCas9. Similar suitable split points can be identified for Cpf1. The following table 6 presents non-limiting potential split regions within As and LbCpf1. A split site within such a region may be opportune. For Fn, As and Lb Cpf1 mutants, it should be readily apparent what the corresponding position for a potential split site is, for example, based on a sequence alignment. For non-Fn, As and Lb enzymes one can use the crystal structure of an ortholog if a relatively high degree of homology exists between the ortholog and the intended Cpf1, or one can use computational prediction. Further it is described that the first and second fusion constructs of the CRISPR effector protein can be delivered in the same or separate vectors. In particular embodiments, a first half of the inducible dimer is fused to one or more nuclear localization constructs while the second half is fused to one or more nuclear export signals. The therapeutic methods which involve the use of the inducible dimer comprise the step of administering the vectors comprising the first and second fusion constructs to the subject and administering an inducer energy source to the subject. In particular embodiments, the inducer energy source is rapamycin. It is further envisaged that the methods can involve administering, a repair template, in the same or a different vector as the inducible dimer fragments. An exemplary treatment regimen with Rapamycin can last 12 days. The use of the split Cpf1 effector protein system described herein allows a further control of the CRISPR-Cas activity. More particularly the use of an inducible system allows for temporal control. In addition, the use of different localization sequences (i.e., the NES and NLS as preferred) can reduce background activity from auto-assembled complexes. Tissue specific promoters, allow for spatial control. Two different tissue specific promoters may be used to exert a finer degree of control if required.f) Use of Self-Inactivating Systems Once all copies of a gene in the genome of a cell have been edited, continued CRISPR/Cpf1 expression in that cell is no longer necessary. Indeed, sustained expression is undesirable to avoid off-target effects and other toxicity issues. WO 2015089351 describes self-Inactivating CRISPR systems which rely on the use of a non-coding guide target sequence within the CRISPR vector itself. Thus, after expression begins, the CRISPR system will lead to its own destruction, but before destruction is complete it will have time to edit the genomic copies of the target gene (which, with a normal point mutation in a diploid cell, may need at most two edits). Accordingly, the methods may involve the use of a self-inactivating CRISPR-Cas system which includes one additional RNA (i.e., guide RNA) that targets the coding sequence for the CRISPR enzyme itself or that targets one or more non-coding guide target sequences complementary to unique sequences present in within the promoter driving expression of the non-coding RNA elements, within the promoter driving expression of the Cpf1 gene, within 100 bp of the ATG translational start codon in the Cpf1 coding sequence, or within the inverted terminal repeat (iTR) of a viral delivery vector, e.g., in the AAV genome. Similarly, self-inactivating systems which make use of \"governing guides\" are exemplified in relation to Cas9 in US2015232881A1 (also published as WO2015070083 (A1) referenced elsewhere herein and incorporated herein by reference, and may be extrapolated to Cpf1. More particularly Methods and compositions that use, or include, a nucleic acid, e.g., a DNA, that encodes a Cpf1 molecule or a gRNA molecule, can, in addition, use or include a \"governing gRNA molecule.\" The governing gRNA molecule can complex with the Cpf1 molecule to inactivate or silence a component of a Cpf1 system. The additional gRNA molecule, referred to herein as a governing gRNA molecule, comprises a targeting domain which targets a component of the Cpf1 system. In an embodiment, the governing gRNA molecule targets and silences (1) a nucleic acid that encodes a Cpf1 molecule (i.e., a Cpf1-targeting gRNA molecule), (2) a nucleic acid that encodes a gRNA molecule (i.e., a gRNA-targeting gRNA molecule), or (3) a nucleic acid sequence engineered into the Cpf1 components that is designed with minimal homology to other nucleic acid sequences in the cell to minimize off-target cleavage (i.e., an engineered control sequence-targeting gRNA molecule). The targeting sequence for the governing gRNA can be selected to increase regulation or control of the Cpf1 system and/or to reduce or minimize off-target effects of the system. For example, a governing gRNA can minimize undesirable cleavage, e.g., \"recleavage\" after Cpf1 mediated alteration of a target nucleic acid or off-target cutting of Cpf1, by inactivating (e.g., cleaving) a nucleic acid that encodes a Cpf1 molecule. In an embodiment, a governing gRNA places temporal or other limit(s) on the level of expression or activity of the Cpf1 molecule/gRNA molecule complex. In an embodiment, the governing gRNA reduces off-target or other unwanted activity. The additional guide RNA can be delivered via a vector, e.g., a separate vector or the same vector that is encoding the CRISPR complex. When provided by a separate vector, the CRISPR RNA that targets Cpf1 expression can be administered sequentially or simultaneously. When administered sequentially, the CRISPR RNA that targets Cpf1 expression is to be delivered after the CRISPR RNA that is intended for e.g. gene editing or gene engineering. This period may be a period of minutes (e.g. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 60 minutes). This period may be a period of hours (e.g. 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours). This period may be a period of days (e.g. 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 7 days). This period may be a period of weeks (e.g. 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks). This period may be a period of months (e.g. 2 months, 4 months, 8 months, 12 months). This period may be a period of years (2 years, 3 years, 4 years). In this fashion, the Cas enzyme associates with a first gRNA capable of hybridizing to a first target, such as a genomic locus or loci of interest and undertakes the function(s) desired of the CRISPR-Cas system (e.g., gene engineering); and subsequently the Cpf1 enzyme may then associate with the second gRNA capable of hybridizing to the sequence comprising at least part of the Cpf1 or CRISPR cassette. Where the gRNA targets the sequences encoding expression of the Cpf1 protein, the enzyme becomes impeded and the system becomes self-inactivating. In the same manner, CRISPR RNA that targets Cpf1 expression applied via, for example liposome, lipofection, nanoparticles, microvesicles as explained herein, may be administered sequentially or simultaneously. Similarly, self-inactivation may be used for inactivation of one or more guide RNA used to target one or more targets. In some embodiments, a single gRNA is provided that is capable of hybridization to a sequence downstream of a CRISPR enzyme start codon, whereby after a period of time there is a loss of the CRISPR enzyme expression. In some embodiments, one or more gRNA(s) are provided that are capable of hybridization to one or more coding or non-coding regions of the polynucleotide encoding the CRISPR-Cas system, whereby after a period of time there is a inactivation of one or more, or in some cases all, of the CRISPR-Cas systems. In some aspects of the system, and not to be limited by theory, the cell may comprise a plurality of CRISPR-Cas complexes, wherein a first subset of CRISPR complexes comprise a first chiRNA capable of targeting a genomic locus or loci to be edited, and a second subset of CRISPR complexes comprise at least one second chiRNA capable of targeting the polynucleotide encoding the CRISPR-Cas system, wherein the first subset of CRISPR-Cas complexes mediate editing of the targeted genomic locus or loci and the second subset of CRISPR eventually inactivate the CRISPR-Cas system, thereby inactivating further CRISPR-Cas expression in the cell. Thus the invention provides a CRISPR-Cas system comprising one or more vectors for delivery to a eukaryotic cell, wherein the vector(s) encode(s): (i) a CRISPR enzyme; (ii) a first guide RNA capable of hybridizing to a target sequence in the cell; (iii) a second guide RNA capable of hybridizing to one or more target sequence(s) in the vector which encodes the CRISPR enzyme; (iv) at least one tracr mate sequence; and (v) at least one tracr sequence, The first and second complexes can use the same tracr and tracr mate, thus differing only by the guide sequence, wherein, when expressed within the cell: the first guide RNA directs sequence-specific binding of a first CRISPR complex to the target sequence in the cell; the second guide RNA directs sequence-specific binding of a second CRISPR complex to the target sequence in the vector which encodes the CRISPR enzyme; the CRISPR complexes comprise (a) a tracr mate sequence hybridised to a tracr sequence and (b) a CRISPR enzyme bound to a guide RNA, such that a guide RNA can hybridize to its target sequence; and the second CRISPR complex inactivates the CRISPR-Cas system to prevent continued expression of the CRISPR enzyme by the cell. The CRISPR enzyme can be Cpf1, particularly FnCpf1 or AsCpf1. Further characteristics of the vector(s), the encoded enzyme, the guide sequences, etc. are disclosed elsewhere herein. For instance, one or both of the guide sequence(s) can be part of a chiRNA sequence which provides the guide, tracr mate and tracr sequences within a single RNA, such that the system can encode (i) a CRISPR enzyme; (ii) a first chiRNA comprising a sequence capable of hybridizing to a first target sequence in the cell, a first tracr mate sequence, and a first tracr sequence; (iii) a second guide RNA capable of hybridizing to the vector which encodes the CRISPR enzyme, a second tracr mate sequence, and a second tracr sequence. Similarly, the enzyme can include one or more NLS, etc. The various coding sequences (CRISPR enzyme, guide RNAs, tracr and tracr mate) can be included on a single vector or on multiple vectors. For instance, it is possible to encode the enzyme on one vector and the various RNA sequences on another vector, or to encode the enzyme and one chiRNA on one vector, and the remaining chiRNA on another vector, or any other permutation. In general, a system using a total of one or two different vectors is preferred. Where multiple vectors are used, it is possible to deliver them in unequal numbers, and ideally with an excess of a vector which encodes the first guide RNA relative to the second guide RNA, thereby assisting in delaying final inactivation of the CRISPR system until genome editing has had a chance to occur. Thus the target sequence in the vector may be capable of inactivating expression of the CRISPR effector protein. Suitable target sequences can be, for instance, near to or within the translational start codon for the Cpf1 coding sequence, in a non-coding sequence in the promoter driving expression of the non-coding RNA elements, within the promoter driving expression of the Cpf1 gene, within 100 bp of the ATG translational start codon in the Cpf1 coding sequence, and/or within the inverted terminal repeat (iTR) of a viral delivery vector, e.g., in the AAV genome. A double stranded break near this region can induce a frame shift in the Cpf1 coding sequence, causing a loss of protein expression. An alternative target sequence for the \"self-inactivating\" guide RNA would aim to edit/inactivate regulatory regions/sequences needed for the expression of the CRISPR-Cpf1 system or for the stability of the vector. For instance, if the promoter for the Cpf1 coding sequence is disrupted then transcription can be inhibited or prevented. Similarly, if a vector includes sequences for replication, maintenance or stability then it is possible to target these. For instance, in a AAV vector a useful target sequence is within the iTR. Other useful sequences to target can be promoter sequences, polyadenlyation sites, etc. Furthermore, if the guide RNAs are expressed in array format, the \"self-inactivating\" guide RNAs that target both promoters simultaneously will result in the excision of the intervening nucleotides from within the CRISPR-Cas expression construct, effectively leading to its complete inactivation. Similarly, excision of the intervening nucleotides will result where the guide RNAs target both ITRs, or targets two or more other CRISPR-Cas components simultaneously. Self-inactivation as explained herein is applicable, in general, with CRISPR-Cpf1 systems in order to provide regulation of the CRISPR-Cpf1. For example, self-inactivation as explained herein may be applied to the CRISPR repair of mutations, for example expansion disorders, as explained herein. As a result of this self-inactivation, CRISPR repair is only transiently active. Addition of non-targeting nucleotides to the 5 end (e.g. 1-10 nucleotides, preferably 1-5 nucleotides) of the \"self-inactivating\" guide RNA can be used to delay its processing and/or modify its efficiency as a means of ensuring editing at the targeted genomic locus prior to CRISPR-Cpf1 shutdown. In one aspect of the self-inactivating AAV-CRISPR-Cpf1 system, plasmids that co-express one or sgRNAs that target a Cpf1 sequence at or near the engineered ATG start site (e.g. within 5 nucleotides, within 15 nucleotides, within 30 nucleotides, within 50 nucleotides, within 100 nucleotides). A regulatory sequence in the U6 promoter region can also be targeted with an sgRNA. The U6-driven sgRNAs may be designed in an array format such that multiple sgRNA sequences can be simultaneously released. When first delivered into target tissue/cells (left cell) sgRNAs begin to accumulate while Cpf1 protein levels rise in the nucleus. Cpf1 complexes with all of the sgRNAs to mediate genome editing and self-inactivation of the CRISPR-Cpf1 plasmids. One aspect of a self-inactivating CRISPR-Cpf1 system is expression of singly or in tandam array format from 1 up to 4 or more different guide sequences; e.g. up to about 20 or about 30 guides sequences. Each individual self-inactivating guide sequence may target a different target. Such may be processed from, e.g. one chimeric pol3 transcript. Pol3 promoters such as U6 or H1 promoters may be used. Pol2 promoters such as those mentioned throughout herein. Inverted terminal repeat (iTR) sequences may flank the Pol3 promoter-sgRNA(s)-Pol2 promoter-Cas9. In particular embodiments one or more guide(s) edit the one or more target(s) while one or more self-inactivating guides inactivate the CRISPR/Cpf1 system. Thus, for example, the described CRISPR-Cpf1 system for repairing expansion disorders may be directly combined with the self-inactivating CRISPR-Cpf1 system described herein. Such a system may, for example, have two guides directed to the target region for repair as well as at least a third guide directed to self-inactivation of the CRISPR-Cpf1. Reference is made to Application Ser. No. PCT/US2014/069897, entitled \"Compositions And Methods Of Use Of Crispr-Cas Systems In Nucleotide Repeat Disorders,\" published Dec. 12, 2014 as WO/2015/089351. In particular embodiments, the gene editing systems described herein are placed under the control of a passcode kill switch, which is a mechanism which efficiently kills the host cell when the conditions of the cell are altered. This is ensured by introducing hybrid LacI-GalR family transcription factors, which may need the presence of IPTG to be switched on (Chan et al. 2015 Nature Chemical Biology doi:10.1038/nchembio.1979 which can be used to drive a gene encoding an enzyme critical for cell-survival. By combining different transcription factors sensitive to different chemicals, a \"code\" can be generated. This system can be used to spatially and temporally control the extent of CRISPR-induced genetic modifications, which can be of interest in different fields including therapeutic applications and may also be of interest to avoid the \"escape\" of GMOs from their intended environment.g) Use of \"Off-Switches\" In particular embodiments, it may be possible to make use of specific inhibitors and/or agonist of Cpf1. Off-switches and On-switches may be any molecules (i.e. peptides, proteins, small molecules, nucleic acids) capable of interfering with or acting as an agonist for any aspect of the Cas9 effector protein. For instance, Pawluck et al. 2016 (Cell 167, 1-10) describe mobile elements from bacteria that encode protein inhibitors of Cas9. Three families of anti-CRISPRs were found to inhibit N. meningitidis Cas9 in vivo and in vitro. The anti-CRISPRs bind directly to NmeCas9. These proteins are described to be potent \"off-switches\" for NmeCas9 genome editing in human cells. Methods for identifying small molecules which affect efficiency of Cas9 are described for example by Yu et al. (Cell Stem Cell 16, 142-147, 2015). In certain embodiments small molecules may be used for control Cas9. Maji et al. describe a small molecule-regulated protein degron domain to control Cas9 system editing. Maji et al. \"Multidimensional chemical control of CRISPR-Cas9\" Nature Chemical Biology (2017) 13:9-12. In certain example embodiments, the inhibitor may be a bacteriophage derived protein. See Rauch et \"Inhibition of CRISPR-Cas9 Bacteriophage example embodiments, the anti-CRISPR may inhibit CRISPR-Cas systems by binding to guide molecules. See Shin et al. \"Disabling Cas9 by an anti-CRISPR DNA doi:dx.doi.org/10.1101/129627. In particular embodiments, intracellular DNA is removed by genetically encoded DNai which responds to a transcriptional input and degrades user-defined DNA as described in Voigt, Nature Communications 6: 6989 (2015).Efficacy a. Enzyme Stability The level of expression of a protein is dependent on many factors, including the quantity of mRNA, its stability and rates of ribosome initiation. The stability or degradation of mRNA is an important factor. Several strategies have been described to increase mRNA stability. One aspect is codon-optimization. It has been found that GC-rich genes are expressed several-fold to over a 100-fold more efficiently than their GC-poor counterparts. This effect could be directly attributed to increased steady-state mRNA levels, and more particularly to efficient transcription or mRNA processing (not decreased degradation) (Kudla et al. Plos Biology dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio0040180). Also, it has been found that ribosomal density has a significant effect on the transcript half-life. More particularly, it was found that an increase in stability can be achieved through the incorporation of nucleotide sequences that are capable of forming secondary structures, which often recruit ribosomes, which impede mRNA degrading enzymes. WO2011/141027 describes that slowly-read codons can be positioned in such a way as to cause high ribosome occupancy across a critical region of the 5 end of the mRNA can increase the half-life of a message by as much as 25%, and produce a similar uplift in protein production. In contrast, positioning even a single slow-read codon before this critical region can significantly destabilize the mRNA and result in an attenuation of protein expression. This understanding enables the design of mRNAs so as to suit the desired functionality. In addition, chemical modifications such as those described for guide sequences herein can be envisaged to increase mRNA stability. b. Guide Stability In certain embodiments, the methods make use of chemically modified guide RNAs. Examples of guide RNA chemical modifications include, without limitation, incorporation of 2 is critical region can significantly o increased steady-state mRNA levels, and more) at one or more terminal nucleotides. Such chemically modified guide RNAs can comprise increased stability and increased activity as compared to unmodified guide RNAs, though on-target vs. off-target specificity is (See, Hendel, 2015, Nat Biotechnol. 33(9):985-9, doi: 10.1038/nbt.3290, published online 29 Jun. 2015). Chemically modified guide RNAs father include, without limitation, RNAs with phosphorothioate linkages and locked nucleic acid (LNA) nucleotides comprising a methylene bridge between the 2 and 4 carbons of the ribose ring.Select Best Target Site in Gene a) Selection within a Target Gene Studies to date suggest that while sgRNA activity can be quite high, there is significant variability among sgRNAs in their ability to generate the desired target cleavage. Efforts have been made to identify design criteria to maximize guide RNA efficacy. Doench et al. (Nat Biotechnol. 2014 December; 32(12): 1262-1267 and Nat Biotechnol. PubMed PMID: 26780180) describe the development of a quantitative model to optimize sgRNA activity prediction, and a tool to use this model for sgRNA design. Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the methods provided herein comprise identifying an optimal guide sequence based on a statistical comparison of active guide RNAs, such as described by Doench et al. (above). In particular embodiments, at least five gRNAs are designed per target and these are tested empirically in cells to generate at least one which has sufficiently high activity. ***Note that there is mention of a manual entitled \"]\" ]How to design CRISPR crRNA for gene disruption \"from integrated technologies which apparently mentions concept of \"targeting an early 5 exon of your gene reduces the chances of functional [off-target]\" but this link is no longer working.b) Identification of Suitable Guide Sequence Currently RNA guides are designed using the reference human genome; however, failing to take into account variation in the human population may confound the therapeutic outcome for a given RNA guide. The recently released ExAC dataset, based on 60,706 individuals, contains on average one variant per eight nucleotides in the human exome (Lek, M. et al. Analysis of protein-coding genetic variation in 60,706 humans. Nature 536, 285-291 (2016)). This highlights the potential for genetic variation to impact the efficacy of certain RNA guides across patient populations for CRISPR-based gene therapy, due to the presence of mismatches between the RNA guide and variants present in the target site of specific patients. To assess this impact, we use the ExAC dataset to catalog variants present in all possible targets in the human reference exome that either (i) disrupt the target PAM sequence or (ii) introduce mismatches between the RNA guide and the genomic DNA, which can collectively be termed target variation ( Ideally, personalized genomic medicine would tailor RNA-guided endonuclease therapeutics for each patient. However, it would likely be cost-prohibitive and infeasible from a regulatory standpoint to design an individual RNA guide for each patient receiving a genome editing therapy. The analysis of the impact of genetic variation on the efficacy and safety of RNA-guided endonucleases motivates the following framework to streamline the design and testing of genome editing therapeutics ( Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the methods provided herein comprise one or more of the following steps: (1) identifying platinum targets, (2) selection of the guides to minimize the number of off-target candidates occurring on high frequency haplotypes in the patient population; (3) select guide (and/or effector protein) based low frequency variation captured in large scale sequencing datasets to estimate the number of guide RNA-enzyme combinations required to effectively and safely treat different sizes of patient populations, and (4) confirm or select guide based on pre-therapeutic whole genome sequencing of individual patient. In particular embodiments, a \"platinum\" target is one that does not contain variants occurring at >0.01% allele frequency. Methods for Determining on/Off-Target Activity and Selecting Suitable Target Sequences/Guides In certain example embodiments, parameters such as, but not limited to, off-target candidates, PAM restrictiveness, target cleavage efficiency, or effector protein specific may be determined using sequencing-based double-strand 29, 1446-1457 (2010)), BLESS (Crosetto et al. Nat. Methods 10, 361-365 (2013); Ran et al. Nature 520, 186-191 (2015); Slaymaker et al. Science 351, 84-88 (2016)), GUIDEseq (Tsai et al. Nat. Biotech 33, 187-197 (2015)), Digenome-seq (Kim et al. Nat. Methods 12, 237-43 (2015)), IDLV-mediated DNA break capture (Wang et al. Nat. Biotechnol. 33, 179-186 (2015), HTGTS (Frock et al. End-Seq al. Mol. Cell 63, 898-911 (2016), and DSBCapture (Lensing et al. Nat. Methods 13, 855-857 (2016). Additional methods that may be used to assess target cleavage efficiency include SITE-Seq (Cameron et al. Nature Methods, 14, 600-606 (2017), and CIRCLE-seq (Tsai et al. Nature Methods 14, 607-614 (2017)). Methods useful for assessing Cpf1 RNase activity include those disclosed in Zhong et al. Nature Chemical Biology Jun. 19, 2017 doi: 10.1038/NCHEMBIO.2410. Increased RNase activity and the ability to excise multiple CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) from a single RNA polymerase I-driven RNA transcript can simplify modification of multiple genomic targets and can be used to increase the efficiency of Cpf1-mediated editing.Bliss Other suitable assays include those described in Yan et al. (\"BLISS: quantitative and versatile genome-wide profiling of DNA breaks in situ\", BioRxiv, Dec. 4, 2016, doi: dx.doi.org/10.1101/091629) describe a versatile, sensitive and quantitative method for detecting DSBs applicable to low-input specimens of both cells and tissues that is scalable for high-throughput DSB mapping in multiple samples. Breaks Labeling In Situ and Sequencing (BLISS), features efficient in situ DSB labeling in fixed cells or tissue sections immobilized onto a solid surface, linear amplification of tagged DSBs via T7-mediated in vitro transcription (IVT) for greater sensitivity, and accurate DSB quantification by incorporation of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs).Curtain A further method, has been developed which may also be useful in assessing certain parameters disclosed herein. The method allowing on target and off target cutting of a nuclease to be assessed in a direct and unbiased way using in vitro cutting of immobilized nucleic acid molecules. Further reference is made to International Patent Application No. PCT/US2017/028009 entitled \"Unbiased Detection of Nucleic Acid Modifications\" filed on Jun. 16, 2017. This method may also be used to select a suitable guide RNA. The method allows the detection of a nucleic acid modification, by performing the following steps: i) contacting one or more nucleic acid molecules immobilized on a solid support (immobilized nucleic acid molecules) with an agent capable of inducing a nucleic acid modification; and ii) sequencing at least part of said one or more immobilized nucleic acid molecules that comprises the nucleic acid modification using a primer specifically binding to a primer binding site. This method further allows the selection of a guide RNA from a plurality of guide RNAs specific for a selected target sequence. In particular embodiments, the method comprises contacting a plurality of nucleic acid molecules immobilized on a solid support (immobilized nucleic acid molecules) with a plurality of RNA-guided nuclease complexes capable of inducing a nucleic acid break, said plurality of RNA-guided nuclease complexes comprising a plurality of different guide RNA's, thereby inducing one or more nucleic acid breaks; attaching an adapter comprising a primer binding site to said one or more immobilized nucleic acid molecules comprising a nucleic acid break; sequencing at least part of said one or more immobilized nucleic acid molecules comprising a nucleic acid break using a primer specifically binding to said primer binding site; and selecting a guide RNA based on location and/or amount of said one or more breaks. In particular embodiments, the method comprises determining one or more locations in said one or more immobilized nucleic acid molecules comprising a break other than a location comprising said selected target sequence (off-target breaks) and selecting a guide RNA based on said one or more locations. In particular embodiments, step v comprises determining a number of sites in said one or more immobilized nucleic acid molecules comprising off-target breaks and selecting a guide RNA based on said number of sites. In a further embodiment, step iv comprises both determining the location of off-targets breaks and the number of locations of off-target breaks.Safety 1. Select Protein with Shortest Half-Lifea) Inherent Half-Life of the Effector Protein The extended presence of an effector protein after having performed its function at the target site is a potential safety concern, both for off-target effects and direct toxicity of the effector protein. It has been reported that upon direct delivery to the cell by LNP, CRISPR effector proteins degrade rapidly within the cell (Kim et al. Genome Res. 2014 June; 24(6): 1012-1019). Where the effector protein is to be expressed from a plasmid, strategies to actively reduce the half-life of the protein may be of interest.b) Use of Destabilized Domains In certain embodiments, the methods provided herein involve the use of a Cpf1 effector protein which is associated with or fused to a destabilization domain (DD). The technology relating to the use of destabilizing domains is described in detail in WO2016/106244, which is incorporated by reference herein. Destabilizing domains (DD) are domains which can confer instability to a wide range of proteins; see, e.g., Miyazaki, J Am Chem Soc. Mar. 7, 2012; 134(9): 3942-3945, and Chung H Nature Chemical Biology Vol. 11 Sep. 2015 pgs 713-720, incorporated herein by reference. DD can be associated with, e.g., fused to, advantageously with a linker, to a CRISPR enzyme, whereby the DD can be stabilized in the presence of a ligand and when there is the absence thereof the DD can become destabilized, whereby the CRISPR enzyme is entirely destabilized, or the DD can be stabilized in the absence of a ligand and when the ligand is present the DD can become destabilized; the DD allows the Cpf1 effector to be regulated or controlled, thereby providing means for regulation or control of the system. For instance, when a protein of interest is expressed as a fusion with the DD tag, it is destabilized and rapidly degraded in the cell, e.g., by proteasomes. Thus, absence of stabilizing ligand leads to a DD-associated Cpf1 being degraded. Peak activity of the Cpf1 effector is relevant to reduce off-target effects and for the general safety of the system. Advantages of the DD system include that it can be dosable, orthogonal (e.g., a ligand only affects its cognate DD so two or more systems can operate independently), transportable (e.g., may work in different cell types or cell lines) and allows for temporal control. Suitable DD\u2014stabilizing ligand pairs are known in the art and also described in WO2016/106244. The size of Destabilization Domain varies but is typically approx.-approx. 100-300 amino acids in size. Suitable examples include ER50 and/or DHFR50. A corresponding stabilizing ligand for ER50 is, for example, 4HT or CMP8. In some embodiments, one or two DDs may be fused to the N-terminal end of the CRISPR enzyme with one or two DDs fused to the C-terminal of the CRISPR enzyme. While the DD can be provided directly at N and/or C terminal(s) of the Cpf1 effector protein, they can also be fused via a linker, such as a GlySer linker, or an NLS and/or NES. A commercially available DD system is the CloneTech, ProteoTuner system; the stabilizing ligand is Shield1. the stabilizing ligand is a 'small molecule', preferably it is cell-permeable and has a high affinity for its corresponding DD.2. Select Least Immunogenic RNP When administering an agent to a mammal, there is always the risk of an immune response to the agent and/or its delivery vehicle. Circumventing the immune response is a major challenge for most delivery vehicles. Viral vectors, which express immunogenic epitopes within the organism typically induce an immune response. Nanoparticle and lipid-based vectors to some extent address this problem. Yin et al. demonstrate a therapeutic approach combining viral delivery of the guide RNA with lipid nanoparticle-mediated delivery of the CRISPR effector protein (Nature Biotechnology 34:328-33(2016)). Ziris et al. describes cationin-lipid mediated delivery of Cas9:guideRNA nuclease complexes to cells. The CRISPR effector proteins, which are of bacterial origin, also inherently carry the risk of eliciting an immune response. This may be addressed by humanizing the Cpf1 effector protein.3. Introduce Modifications in Guide RNA to Minimize Immunogenicity Chemical modifications of RNAs have been used to avoid reactions of the innate immune system. Judge et al. (2006) demonstrated that immune stimulation by synthetic siRNA can be completely abrogated by selective incorporation of 2-O-methyl (2OMe) uridine or Biol., 365 (2007), pp. 90-108) observed that replacement of only uridine bases of siRNA with either 2-fluoro or 2-O-methyl modified counterparts abrogated upregulation of genes involved in the regulation of the immune response. Similarly Hendel et al. tested sgRNAs with both backbone and sugar modifications that confer nuclease stability and can reduce immunostimulatory effects (Hendel et al., Nat. Biotechnol., 33 (2015), pp. 985-989). Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the methods comprise modifying the guide RNA so as to minimize immunogenicity using one or more of these methods.Identify Optimal Dosage to Minimize Toxicity and Maximize Specificity It is generally accepted that the dosage of CRISPR components will be relevant to toxicity and specificity of the system (Pattanayak et al. Nat Biotechnol. 2013 September; 31(9): al. (Nat Biotechnol. September; 827-832) demonstrated that the dosage of SpCas9 and sgRNA can be titrated to address these issues. In certain example embodiments, toxicity is minimized by saturating complex with guide by either pre-forming complex, putting guide under control of a strong promoter, or via timing of delivery to ensure saturating conditions available during expression of the effector protein.Identifying Appropriate Delivery Vector In some embodiments, the components of the CRISPR system may be delivered in various form, such as combinations of DNA/RNA or RNA/RNA or protein/RNA. For example, the Cpf1 may be delivered as a DNA-coding polynucleotide or an RNA-coding polynucleotide or as a protein. The guide may be delivered as a DNA-coding polynucleotide or an RNA. All possible combinations are envisioned, including mixed forms of delivery. In some aspects, the invention provides methods comprising delivering one or more polynucleotides, such as or one or more vectors as described herein, one or more transcripts thereof, and/or one or proteins transcribed therefrom, to a host cell.Delivery The methods herein may include delivering one or more compositions herein into a cell, a tissue, an organ, or a subject.Vectors In general, and throughout this specification, the term \"vector\" refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. It is a replicon, such as a plasmid, phage, or cosmid, into which another DNA segment may be inserted so as to bring about the replication of the inserted segment. Generally, a vector is capable of replication when associated with the proper control elements. Vectors include, but are not limited to, nucleic acid molecules that are single-stranded, double-stranded, or partially double-stranded; nucleic acid molecules that comprise one or more free ends, no free ends (e.g., circular); nucleic acid molecules that comprise DNA, RNA, or both; and other varieties of polynucleotides known in the art. One type of vector is a \"plasmid,\" which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments can be inserted, such as by standard molecular cloning techniques. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein virally-derived DNA or RNA sequences are present in the vector for packaging into a virus (e.g., retroviruses, replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses, replication defective adenoviruses, and adeno-associated viruses). Viral vectors also include polynucleotides carried by a virus for transfection into a host cell. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively-linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as \"expression vectors.\" Vectors for and that result in expression in a eukaryotic cell can be referred to herein as \"eukaryotic expression vectors.\" Common expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. Recombinant expression vectors can comprise a nucleic acid of the invention in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell, which means that the recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulatory elements, which may be selected on the basis of the host cells to be used for expression, that is operatively-linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. Within a recombinant expression vector, \"operably linked\" is intended to mean that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory element(s) in a manner that allows for expression of the nucleotide sequence (e.g., in an in vitro transcription/translation system or in a host cell when the vector is introduced into the host cell). Advantageous vectors include lentiviruses and adeno-associated viruses, and types of such vectors can also be selected for targeting particular types of cells. With regards to recombination and cloning methods, mention is made of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/815,730, published Sep. 2, 2004 as US 2004-0171156 A1, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. The term \"regulatory element\" is intended to include promoters, enhancers, internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES), and other expression control elements (e.g., transcription termination signals, such as polyadenylation signals and poly-U sequences). Such regulatory elements are described, for example, in Goeddel, GENE EXPRESSION TECHNOLOGY: METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990). Regulatory elements include those that direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in many types of host cell and those that direct expression of the nucleotide sequence only in certain host cells (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory sequences). A tissue-specific promoter may direct expression primarily in a desired tissue of interest, such as muscle, neuron, bone, skin, blood, specific organs (e.g., liver, pancreas), or particular cell types (e.g., lymphocytes). Regulatory elements may also direct expression in a temporal-dependent manner, such as in a cell-cycle dependent or developmental stage-dependent manner, which may or may not also be tissue or cell-type specific. In some embodiments, a vector comprises one or more pol III promoter (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more pol III promoters), one or more pol II promoters (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more pol II promoters), one or more pol I promoters (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more pol I promoters), or combinations thereof. Examples of pol III promoters include, but are not limited to, U6 and H1 promoters. Examples of pol II promoters include, but are not limited to, the retroviral Rous sarcoma virus promoter, the phosphoglycerol kinase (PGK) promoter, and the EFa promoter. Also encompassed by the term \"regulatory element\" are enhancer elements, such as the 3 of rabbit -globin (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., Vol. 78(3), p. 1527-31, 1981). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector can depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression desired, etc. A vector can be introduced into host cells to thereby produce transcripts, proteins, or peptides, including fusion proteins or peptides, encoded by nucleic acids as described herein (e.g., clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) transcripts, proteins, enzymes, mutant forms thereof, fusion proteins thereof, etc.). With regards to regulatory sequences, mention is made of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/491,026, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. With regards to promoters, mention is made of PCT publication WO 2011/028929 and U.S. application Ser. No. 12/511,940, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Advantageous vectors include lentiviruses and adeno-associated viruses, and types of such vectors can also be selected for targeting particular types of cells. In particular embodiments, use is made of bicistronic vectors for guide RNA and (optionally modified or mutated) CRISPR enzymes (e.g. Cpf1). Bicistronic expression vectors for guide RNA and (optionally modified or mutated) CRISPR enzymes are preferred. In general and particularly in this embodiment (optionally modified or mutated) CRISPR enzymes are preferably driven by the CBh promoter. The RNA may preferably be driven by a Pol III promoter, such as a U6 promoter. Ideally the two are combined. Vectors can be designed for expression of CRISPR transcripts (e.g. nucleic acid transcripts, proteins, or enzymes) in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. For example, CRISPR transcripts can be expressed in bacterial cells such as Escherichia coli, insect cells (using baculovirus expression vectors), yeast cells, or mammalian cells. Suitable host cells are discussed further in Goeddel, GENE EXPRESSION TECHNOLOGY: METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990). Alternatively, the recombinant expression vector can be transcribed and translated in vitro, for example using T7 promoter regulatory sequences and T7 polymerase. Vectors may be introduced and propagated in a prokaryote or prokaryotic cell. In some embodiments, a prokaryote is used to amplify copies of a vector to be introduced into a eukaryotic cell or as an intermediate vector in the production of a vector to be introduced into a eukaryotic cell (e.g. amplifying a plasmid as part of a viral vector packaging system). In some embodiments, a prokaryote is used to amplify copies of a vector and express one or more nucleic acids, such as to provide a source of one or more proteins for delivery to a host cell or host organism. Expression of proteins in prokaryotes is most often carried out in Escherichia coli with vectors containing constitutive or inducible promoters directing the expression of either fusion or non-fusion proteins. Fusion vectors add a number of amino acids to a protein encoded therein, such as to the amino terminus of the recombinant protein. Such fusion vectors may serve one or more purposes, such as: (i) to increase expression of recombinant protein; (ii) to increase the solubility of the recombinant protein; and (iii) to aid in the purification of the recombinant protein by acting as a ligand in affinity purification. Often, in fusion expression vectors, a proteolytic cleavage site is introduced at the junction of the fusion moiety and the recombinant protein to enable separation of the recombinant protein from the fusion moiety subsequent to purification of the fusion protein. Such enzymes, and their cognate recognition sequences, include Factor Xa, thrombin and enterokinase. Example fusion expression vectors include pGEX (Pharmacia Biotech Inc; Smith and Johnson, 1988. Gene 67: pMAL (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) and Piscataway, N.J.) that fuse glutathione S-transferase (GST), maltose E binding protein, or protein A, respectively, to the target recombinant protein. Examples of suitable inducible non-fusion E. coli expression vectors include pTrc (Amrann et al., (1988) Gene 69:301-315) and pET I1d (Studier et al., GENE EXPRESSION TECHNOLOGY: METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990) 60-89). In some embodiments, a vector is a yeast expression vector. Examples of vectors for expression in yeast Saccharomyces cerivisae include pYepSecl 1987. Gene 54: (Invitrogen Corporation, San Diego, Calif.), and picZ (InVitrogen Corp, San Diego, Calif.). In some embodiments, a vector drives protein expression in insect cells using baculovirus expression vectors. Baculovirus vectors available for expression of proteins in cultured insect cells (e.g., SF9 cells) include the pAc series (Smith, et al., 1983. Mol. Cell. Biol. 3: 2156-2165) and the pVL series (Lucklow and Summers, 1989. Virology 170: 31-39). In some embodiments, a vector is capable of driving expression of one or more sequences in mammalian cells using a mammalian expression vector. Examples of mammalian expression vectors include pCDM8 (Seed, 1987. Nature 329: 840) and pMT2PC (Kaufman, et al., 1987. EMBO J. 6: 187-195). When used in mammalian cells, the expression vector's control functions are typically provided by one or more regulatory elements. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma, adenovirus 2, cytomegalovirus, simian virus 40, and others disclosed herein and known in the art. For other suitable expression systems for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells see, e.g., Chapters 16 and 17 of Sambrook, et al., MOLECULAR CLONING: A LABORATORY MANUAL. 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989. In some embodiments, the recombinant mammalian expression vector is capable of directing expression of the nucleic acid preferentially in a particular cell type (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory elements are used to express the nucleic acid). Tissue-specific regulatory elements are known in the art. Non-limiting examples of suitable tissue-specific promoters include the albumin promoter (liver-specific; Pinkert, et al., 1987. Genes Dev. 1: (Calame and Eaton, 1988. Adv. Immunol. 43: 235-275), in particular promoters of T cell receptors (Winoto and Baltimore, 1989. EMBO J. 8: 729-733) and immunoglobulins (Baneiji, et al., 1983. Queen and Baltimore, 1983. Cell 33: 741-748), neuron-specific mammary gland-specific promoters (e.g., milk whey promoter; U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,316 and European Application Publication No. 264,166). Developmentally-regulated promoters are also encompassed, e.g., the murine hox promoters (Kessel and Gruss, 1990. Science 249: 374-379) and the -fetoprotein promoter (Campes and Tilghman, 1989. Genes Dev. 3: 537-546). With regards to these prokaryotic and eukaryotic vectors, mention is made of U.S. Pat. No. 6,750,059, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Other embodiments of the invention may relate to the use of viral vectors, with regards to which mention is made of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/092,085, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Tissue-specific regulatory elements are known in the art and in this regard, mention is made of U.S. Pat. No. 7,776,321, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In some embodiments, a regulatory element is operably linked to one or more elements of a CRISPR system so as to drive expression of the one or more elements of the CRISPR system. In some embodiments, one or more vectors driving expression of one or more elements of a nucleic acid-targeting system are introduced into a host cell such that expression of the elements of the nucleic acid-targeting system direct formation of a nucleic acid-targeting complex at one or more target sites. For example, a nucleic acid-targeting effector enzyme and a nucleic acid-targeting guide RNA could each be operably linked to separate regulatory elements on separate vectors. RNA(s) of the nucleic acid-targeting system can be delivered to a transgenic nucleic acid-targeting effector protein animal or mammal, e.g., an animal or mammal that constitutively or inducibly or conditionally expresses nucleic acid-targeting effector protein; or an animal or mammal that is otherwise expressing nucleic acid-targeting effector proteins or has cells containing nucleic acid-targeting effector proteins, such as by way of prior administration thereto of a vector or vectors that code for and express in vivo nucleic acid-targeting effector proteins. Alternatively, two or more of the elements expressed from the same or different regulatory elements, may be combined in a single vector, with one or more additional vectors providing any components of the nucleic acid-targeting system not included in the first vector. nucleic acid-targeting system elements that are combined in a single vector may be arranged in any suitable orientation, such as one element located 5 with respect to (\"upstream\" of) or 3 with respect to (\"downstream\" of) a second element. The coding sequence of one element may be located on the same or opposite strand of the coding sequence of a second element, and oriented in the same or opposite direction. In some embodiments, a single promoter drives expression of a transcript encoding a nucleic acid-targeting effector protein and the nucleic acid-targeting guide RNA, embedded within one or more intron sequences (e.g., each in a different intron, two or more in at least one intron, or all in a single intron). In some embodiments, the nucleic acid-targeting effector protein and the nucleic acid-targeting guide RNA may be operably linked to and expressed from the same promoter. Delivery vehicles, vectors, particles, nanoparticles, formulations and components thereof for expression of one or more elements of a nucleic acid-targeting system are as used in the foregoing documents, such as WO 2014/093622 (PCT/US2013/074667). In some embodiments, a vector comprises one or more insertion sites, such as a restriction endonuclease recognition sequence (also referred to as a \"cloning site\"). In some embodiments, one or more insertion sites (e.g., about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more insertion sites) are located upstream and/or downstream of one or more sequence elements of one or more vectors. When multiple different guide sequences are used, a single expression construct may be used to target nucleic acid-targeting activity to multiple different, corresponding target sequences within a cell. For example, a single vector may comprise about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, or more guide sequences. In some embodiments, about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more such guide-sequence-containing vectors may be provided, and optionally delivered to a cell. In some embodiments, a vector comprises a regulatory element operably linked to an enzyme-coding sequence encoding a or RNA(s) can be delivered separately; and advantageously at least one of these is delivered via a particle complex. nucleic acid-targeting effector protein mRNA can be delivered prior to the nucleic acid-targeting guide RNA to give time for nucleic acid-targeting protein to be expressed. Nucleic acid-targeting effector mRNA might be administered 1-12 hours (preferably around 2-6 hours) prior to the administration of nucleic acid-targeting guide Alternatively, nucleic acid-targeting effector protein mRNA nucleic acid-targeting guide RNA can be administered together. Advantageously, a second booster dose of guide RNA can be administered 1-12 hours (preferably around 2-6 hours) after the initial administration of nucleic acid-targeting effector protein mRNA+guide RNA. Additional administrations of nucleic acid-targeting effector protein mRNA and/or guide RNA might be useful to achieve the efficient levels of genome modification. In some embodiments, a vector encodes a Cpf1 effector protein comprising one or more nuclear localization sequences (NLSs), such as about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more NLSs. More particularly, vector comprises one or more NLSs not naturally present in the Cpf1 effector protein. Most particularly, the NLS is present in the vector 5 and/or 3 of the Cpf1 effector protein sequence In some embodiments, the RNA-targeting effector protein comprises about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more NLSs at or near the amino-terminus, about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more NLSs at or near the carboxy-terminus, or a combination of these (e.g., zero or at least one or more NLS at the amino-terminus and zero or at one or more NLS at the carboxy terminus). When more than one NLS is present, each may be selected independently of the others, such that a single NLS may be present in more than one copy and/or in combination with one or more other NLSs present in one or more copies. In some embodiments, an NLS is considered near the N- or C-terminus when the nearest amino acid of the NLS is within about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, or more amino acids along the polypeptide chain from the N- or C-terminus. Non-limiting examples of NLSs include an NLS sequence derived from: the NLS of the SV40 virus large T-antigen, having the amino acid sequence PKKKRKV (SEQ ID sequence RMRIZFKNKGKDTAELRRRRVEVSVELRKAKKDEQILKRRNV (SEQ ID domain from sequences (SEQ ID NO: T protein; sequence PQPKKKPL (SEQ ID NO: human p53; the ID of the influenza virus NS1; the sequence RKLKKKIKKL (SEQ ID NO: 60) of the Hepatitis virus delta antigen; the sequence REKKKFLKRR (SEQ ID NO: 61) of Mxl protein; the sequence KRKGDEVDGVDEVAKKKSKK (SEQ ID NO: 62) poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; and the sequence RKCLQAGMNLEARKTKK (SEQ ID NO: 63) of the steroid hormone receptors (human) glucocorticoid. In general, the one or more NLSs are of sufficient strength to drive accumulation of the DNA/RNA-targeting Cas protein in a detectable amount in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell. In general, strength of nuclear localization activity may derive from the number of NLSs in the nucleic acid-targeting effector protein, the particular NLS(s) used, or a combination of these factors. Detection of accumulation in the nucleus may be performed by any suitable technique. For example, a detectable marker may be fused to the nucleic acid-targeting protein, such that location within a cell may be visualized, such as in combination with a means for detecting the location of the nucleus (e.g., a stain specific for the nucleus such as DAPI). Cell nuclei may also be isolated from cells, the contents of which may then be analyzed by any suitable process for detecting protein, such as immunohistochemistry, Western blot, or enzyme activity assay. Accumulation in the nucleus may also be determined indirectly, such as by an assay for the effect of nucleic acid-targeting complex formation (e.g., assay for DNA or RNA cleavage or mutation at the target sequence, or assay for altered gene expression activity affected by DNA or RNA-targeting complex formation and/or DNA or RNA-targeting Cas protein activity), as compared to a control not exposed to the nucleic acid-targeting Cas protein or nucleic acid-targeting complex, or exposed to a nucleic acid-targeting Cas protein lacking the one or more NLSs. In preferred embodiments of the herein described Cpf1 effector protein complexes and systems the codon optimized Cpf1 effector proteins comprise an NLS attached to the C-terminal of the protein. In certain embodiments, other localization tags may be fused to the Cas protein, such as without limitation for localizing the Cas to particular sites in a cell, such as organelles, such mitochondria, The invention also provides a non-naturally occurring or engineered composition, or one or more polynucleotides encoding components of said composition, or vector systems comprising one or more polynucleotides encoding components of said composition for use in a therapeutic method of treatment. The therapeutic method of treatment may comprise gene or genome editing, or gene therapy. The nucleic acids-targeting systems, the vector systems, the vectors and the compositions described herein may be used in various nucleic acids-targeting applications, altering or modifying synthesis of a gene product, such as a protein, nucleic acids cleavage, nucleic acids editing, nucleic acids splicing; trafficking of target nucleic acids, tracing of target nucleic acids, isolation of target nucleic acids, visualization of target nucleic acids, etc. In general, and throughout this specification, the term \"vector\" refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. Vectors include, but are not limited to, nucleic acid molecules that are single-stranded, double-stranded, or partially double-stranded; nucleic acid molecules that comprise one or more free ends, no free ends (e.g., circular); nucleic acid molecules that comprise DNA, RNA, or both; and other varieties of polynucleotides known in the art. One type of vector is a \"plasmid,\" which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments can be inserted, such as by standard molecular cloning techniques. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein virally-derived DNA or RNA sequences are present in the vector for packaging into a virus (e.g., retroviruses, replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses, replication defective adenoviruses, and adeno-associated viruses). Viral vectors also include polynucleotides carried by a virus for transfection into a host cell. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively-linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as \"expression vectors.\" Vectors for and that result in expression in a eukaryotic cell can be referred to herein as \"eukaryotic expression vectors.\" Common expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In certain embodiments, a vector system includes promoter-guide expression cassette in reverse order. Recombinant expression vectors can comprise a nucleic acid of the invention in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell, which means that the recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulatory elements, which may be selected on the basis of the host cells to be used for expression, that is operatively-linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. Advantageous vectors include lentiviruses and adeno-associated viruses, and types of such vectors can also be selected for targeting particular types of cells. In some embodiments, one or more vectors driving expression of one or more elements of a nucleic acid-targeting system are introduced into a host cell such that expression of the elements of the nucleic acid-targeting system direct formation of a nucleic acid-targeting complex at one or more target sites. For example, a nucleic acid-targeting effector module and a nucleic acid-targeting guide RNA could each be operably linked to separate regulatory elements on separate vectors. RNA(s) of the nucleic acid-targeting system can be delivered to a transgenic nucleic acid-targeting effector module animal or mammal, e.g., an animal or mammal that constitutively or inducibly or conditionally expresses nucleic acid-targeting effector module; or an animal or mammal that is otherwise expressing nucleic acid-targeting effector modules or has cells containing nucleic acid-targeting modules, such as by way of prior administration thereto of a vector or vectors that code for and express in vivo nucleic acid-targeting effector modules. Alternatively, two or more of the elements expressed from the same or different regulatory elements, may be combined in a single vector, with one or more additional vectors providing any components of the nucleic acid-targeting system not included in the first vector. nucleic acid-targeting system elements that are combined in a single vector may be arranged in any suitable orientation, such as one element located 5 with respect to (\"upstream\" of) or 3 with respect to (\"downstream\" of) a second element. The coding sequence of one element may be located on the same or opposite strand of the coding sequence of a second element, and oriented in the same or opposite direction. In some embodiments, a single promoter drives expression of a transcript encoding a nucleic acid-targeting effector module and the nucleic acid-targeting guide RNA, embedded within one or more intron sequences (e.g., each in a different intron, two or more in at least one intron, or all in a single intron). In some embodiments, the nucleic acid-targeting effector module and the nucleic acid-targeting guide RNA may be operably linked to and expressed from the same promoter. In an aspect, the invention provides in a vector system comprising one or more vectors, wherein the one or more vectors comprises: a) a first regulatory element operably linked to a nucleotide sequence encoding the engineered CRISPR protein as defined herein; and optionally b) a second regulatory element operably linked to one or more nucleotide sequences encoding one or more nucleic acid molecules comprising a guide RNA comprising a guide sequence, a direct repeat sequence, optionally wherein components (a) and (b) are located on same or different vectors. The invention also provides an engineered, non-naturally occurring Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated (Cas effector module) (CRISPR-Cas effector module) vector system comprising one or more vectors comprising: a) a first regulatory element operably linked to a nucleotide sequence encoding a non-naturally-occurring CRISPR enzyme of any one of the inventive constructs herein; and b) a second regulatory element operably linked to one or more nucleotide sequences encoding one or more of the guide RNAs, the guide RNA comprising a guide sequence, a direct repeat sequence, wherein: components (a) and (b) are located on same or different vectors, the CRISPR complex is formed; the guide RNA targets the target polynucleotide loci and the enzyme alters the polynucleotide loci, and the enzyme in the CRISPR complex has reduced capability of modifying one or more off-target loci as compared to an unmodified enzyme and/or whereby the enzyme in the CRISPR complex has increased capability of modifying the one or more target loci as compared to an unmodified enzyme. As used herein, a CRISPR Cas effector module or CRISRP effector module includes, but is not limited to, Cas9, Cpf1, C2c2, Group 13b, and C2c1. In some embodiments, the CRISPR-Cas effector module may be engineered. In such a system, component (II) may comprise a first regulatory element operably linked to a polynucleotide sequence which comprises the guide sequence, the direct repeat sequence, and wherein component (II) may comprise a second regulatory element operably linked to a polynucleotide sequence encoding the CRISPR enzyme. In such a system, where applicable the guide RNA may comprise a chimeric RNA. In such a system, component (I) may comprise a first regulatory element operably linked to the guide sequence and the direct repeat sequence, and wherein component (II) may comprise a second regulatory element operably linked to a polynucleotide sequence encoding the CRISPR enzyme. Such a system may comprise more than one guide RNA, and each guide RNA has a different target whereby there is multiplexing. Components (a) and (b) may be on the same vector. In any such systems comprising vectors, the one or more vectors may comprise one or more viral vectors, such as one or more retrovirus, lentivirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus or herpes simplex virus. In any such systems comprising regulatory elements, at least one of said regulatory elements may comprise a tissue-specific promoter. The tissue-specific promoter may direct expression in a mammalian blood cell, in a mammalian liver cell or in a mammalian eye. In any of the above-described compositions or systems the direct repeat sequence, may comprise one or more protein-interacting RNA aptamers. The one or more aptamers may be located in the tetraloop. The one or more aptamers may be capable of binding MS2 bacteriophage coat protein. In any of the above-described compositions or systems the cell may be a eukaryotic cell or a prokaryotic cell; wherein the CRISPR complex is operable in the cell, and whereby the enzyme of the CRISPR complex has reduced capability of modifying one or more off-target loci of the cell as compared to an unmodified enzyme and/or whereby the enzyme in the CRISPR complex has increased capability of modifying the one or more target loci as compared to an unmodified enzyme. The invention also provides a CRISPR complex of any of the above-described compositions or from any of the above-described systems. The invention also provides a method of modifying a locus of interest in a cell comprising contacting the cell with any of the herein-described engineered CRISPR enzymes (e.g. engineered Cas effector module), compositions or any of the herein-described systems or vector systems, or wherein the cell comprises any of the herein-described CRISPR complexes present within the cell. In such methods the cell may be a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell, preferably a eukaryotic cell. In such methods, an organism may comprise the cell. In such methods the organism may not be a human or other animal. In certain embodiment, the invention also provides a non-naturally-occurring, engineered composition (e.g., engineered Cas9, Cpf1, C2c2, C2c1, Group 29/30, 13b, or any Cas protein which can fit into an AAV vector). Reference is made to Any such method may be ex vivo or in vitro. In certain embodiments, a nucleotide sequence encoding at least one of said guide RNA or Cpf1 effector module is operably connected in the cell with a regulatory element comprising a promoter of a gene of interest, whereby expression of at least one CRISPR-Cas effector module system component is driven by the promoter of the gene of interest. \"operably connected\" is intended to mean that the nucleotide sequence encoding the guide RNA and/or the Cas effector module is linked to the regulatory element(s) in a manner that allows for expression of the nucleotide sequence, as also referred to herein elsewhere. The term \"regulatory element\" is also described herein elsewhere. According to the invention, the regulatory element comprises a promoter of a gene of interest, such as preferably a promoter of an endogenous gene of interest. In certain embodiments, the promoter is at its endogenous genomic location. In such embodiments, the nucleic acid encoding the CRISPR and/or Cas effector module is under transcriptional control of the promoter of the gene of interest at its native genomic location.

In some embodiments, the first regulatory element is a polymerase III promoter. In some embodiments, the second regulatory element is a polymerase II promoter. In some embodiments, each of the guide sequences is at least 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25 nucleotides, or between 16-30, or between 16-25, or between 16-20 nucleotides in length. Recombinant expression vectors can comprise the polynucleotides encoding the Cas effector module, system or complex for use in multiple targeting as defined herein in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell, which means that the recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulatory elements, which may be selected on the basis of the host cells to be used for expression, that is operatively-linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. Within a recombinant expression vector, \"operably linked\" is intended to mean that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory element(s) in a manner that allows for expression of the nucleotide sequence (e.g., in an in vitro transcription/translation system or in a host cell when the vector is introduced into the host cell). In some embodiments, a host cell is transiently or non-transiently transfected with one or more vectors comprising the polynucleotides encoding the Cas effector module, system or complex for use in multiple targeting as defined herein. In some embodiments, a cell is transfected as it naturally occurs in a subject. In some embodiments, a cell that is transfected is taken from a subject. In some embodiments, the cell is derived from cells taken from a subject, such as a cell line. A wide variety of cell lines for tissue culture are known in the art and exemplified herein elsewhere. Cell lines are available from a variety of sources known to those with skill in the art (see, e.g., the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, Va.)). In some embodiments, a cell transfected with one or more vectors comprising the polynucleotides encoding the Cas effector module, system or complex for use in multiple targeting as defined herein is used to establish a new cell line comprising one or more vector-derived sequences.

In some embodiments, cells transiently or non-transiently transfected with one or more vectors comprising the polynucleotides encoding Cas effector module, system or complex for use in multiple targeting as defined herein, or cell lines derived from such cells are used in assessing one or more test compounds. The term \"regulatory element\" is as defined herein elsewhere. Advantageous vectors include lentiviruses and adeno-associated viruses, and types of such vectors can also be selected for targeting particular types of cells. In one aspect, the invention provides a eukaryotic host cell comprising (a) a first regulatory element operably linked to a direct repeat sequence and one or more insertion sites for inserting one or more guide RNA sequences up- or downstream (whichever applicable) of the direct repeat sequence, wherein when expressed, the guide sequence(s) direct(s) sequence-specific binding of the CRISPR complex to the respective target sequence(s) in a eukaryotic cell, wherein the CRISPR complex comprises a Cas effector module complexed with the one or more guide sequence(s) that is hybridized to the respective target sequence(s); and/or (b) a second regulatory element operably linked to an enzyme-coding sequence encoding said Cas effector module comprising preferably at least one nuclear localization sequence and/or NES.

Several aspects of the invention relate to vector systems comprising one or more vectors, or vectors as such. Vectors can be designed for expression of CRISPR transcripts (e.g. nucleic acid transcripts, proteins, or enzymes) in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. For example, CRISPR transcripts can be expressed in bacterial cells such as Escherichia coli, insect cells (using baculovirus expression vectors), yeast cells, or mammalian cells. Suitable host cells are discussed further in Goeddel, GENE EXPRESSION TECHNOLOGY: METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990). Alternatively, the recombinant expression vector can be transcribed and translated in vitro, for example using T7 promoter regulatory sequences and T7 polymerase. In certain aspects the invention involves vectors. Recombinant expression vectors can comprise a nucleic acid of the invention in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell, which means that the recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulatory elements, which may be selected on the basis of the host cells to be used for expression, that is operatively-linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. Within a recombinant expression vector, \"operably linked\" is intended to mean that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory element(s) in a manner that allows for expression of the nucleotide sequence (e.g. in an in vitro transcription/translation system or in a host cell when the vector is introduced into the host cell). With regards to recombination and cloning methods, mention is made of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/815,730, published Sep. 2, 2004 as US 2004-0171156 A1, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. The vector(s) can include the regulatory element(s), e.g., promoter(s). The vector(s) can comprise Cas encoding sequences, and/or a single, but possibly also can comprise at least 3 or 8 or 16 or 32 or 48 or 50 guide RNA(s) (e.g., sgRNAs) a single vector there can be a promoter for each RNA (e.g., sgRNA), advantageously when there are up to about 16 RNA(s) (e.g., sgRNAs); and, when a single vector provides for more than 16 RNA(s) (e.g., sgRNAs), one or more promoter(s) can drive expression of more than one of the RNA(s) (e.g., sgRNAs), e.g., when there are 32 RNA(s) (e.g., sgRNAs), each promoter can drive expression of two RNA(s) (e.g., sgRNAs), and when there are 48 RNA(s) (e.g., sgRNAs), each promoter can drive expression of three RNA(s) (e.g., sgRNAs). By simple arithmetic and well established cloning protocols and the teachings in this disclosure one skilled in the art can readily practice the invention as to the RNA(s) (e.g., sgRNA(s) for a suitable exemplary vector such as AAV, and a suitable promoter such as the U6 promoter, e.g., U6-sgRNAs. For example, the packaging limit of AAV is 4.7 kb. The length of a single U6-sgRNA (plus restriction sites for cloning) is 361 bp. Therefore, the skilled person can readily fit about 12-16, e.g., 13 U6-sgRNA cassettes in a single vector. This can be assembled by any suitable means, such as a golden gate strategy used for TALE assembly (www.genome-engineering.org/taleffectors/). The skilled person can also use a tandem guide strategy to increase the number of U6-sgRNAs by approximately 1.5 times, e.g., to increase from 12-16, e.g., 13 to approximately 18-24, e.g., about 19 U6-sgRNAs. Therefore, one skilled in the art can readily reach approximately 18-24, e.g., about 19 promoter-RNAs, e.g., U6-sgRNAs in a single vector, e.g., an AAV vector. A further means for increasing the number of promoters and RNAs, e.g., sgRNA(s) in a vector is to use a single promoter (e.g., U6) to express an array of RNAs, e.g., sgRNAs separated by cleavable sequences. And an even further means for increasing the number of promoter-RNAs, e.g., sgRNAs in a vector, is to express an array of promoter-RNAs, e.g., sgRNAs separated by cleavable sequences in the intron of a coding sequence or gene; and, in this instance it is advantageous to use a polymerase II promoter, which can have increased expression and enable the transcription of long RNA in a tissue specific manner. (see, e.g., nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/7/e53.short, www.nature.com/mt/journal/v16/n9/abs/mt2008144a.html).In an advantageous embodiment, AAV may package U6 tandem sgRNA targeting up to about 50 genes. Accordingly, from the knowledge in the art and the teachings in this disclosure the skilled person can readily make and use vector(s), e.g., a single vector, expressing multiple RNAs or guides or sgRNAs under the control or operatively or functionally linked to one or more promoters-especially as to the numbers of RNAs or guides or sgRNAs discussed herein, without any undue experimentation. The guide RNA(s), e.g., sgRNA(s) encoding sequences and/or Cas encoding sequences, can be functionally or operatively linked to regulatory element(s) and hence the regulatory element(s) drive expression. The promoter(s) can be constitutive promoter(s) and/or conditional promoter(s) and/or inducible promoter(s) and/or tissue specific promoter(s). The promoter can be selected from the group consisting of RNA polymerases, pol I, pol II, pol III, T7, U6, promoter, the phosphoglycerol kinase (PGK) promoter, and the EF1 promoter. An advantageous promoter is the promoter is U6. Aspects of the invention relate to bicistronic vectors for guide RNA and (optionally modified or mutated) Cas effector modules. Bicistronic expression vectors for guide RNA and (optionally modified or mutated) CRISPR enzymes are preferred. In general and particularly in this embodiment (optionally modified or mutated) CRISPR enzymes are preferably driven by the CBh promoter. The RNA may preferably be driven by a Pol III promoter, such as a U6 promoter. Ideally the two are combined. In some embodiments, a loop in the guide RNA is provided. This may be a stem loop or a tetra loop. The loop is preferably GAAA, but it is not limited to this sequence or indeed to being only 4 bp in length. Indeed, preferred loop forming sequences for use in hairpin structures are four nucleotides in length, and preferably have the sequence GAAA. However, longer or shorter loop sequences may be used, as may alternative sequences. The sequences preferably include a nucleotide triplet (for example, AAA), and an additional nucleotide (for example C or G). Examples of loop forming sequences include CAAA and AAAG. The term \"regulatory element\" is intended to include promoters, enhancers, internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES), and other expression control elements (e.g. transcription termination signals, such as polyadenylation signals and poly-U sequences). Vectors can be designed for expression of CRISPR transcripts (e.g. nucleic acid transcripts, proteins, or enzymes) in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. For example, CRISPR transcripts can be expressed in bacterial cells such as Escherichia coli, insect cells (using baculovirus expression vectors), yeast cells, or mammalian cells. Suitable host cells are discussed further in Goeddel, GENE EXPRESSION TECHNOLOGY: METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990). Alternatively, the recombinant expression vector can be transcribed and translated in vitro, for example using T7 promoter regulatory sequences and T7 polymerase. Vectors may be introduced and propagated in a prokaryote or prokaryotic cell. In some embodiments, a prokaryote is used to amplify copies of a vector to be introduced into a eukaryotic cell or as an intermediate vector in the production of a vector to be introduced into a eukaryotic cell (e.g. amplifying a plasmid as part of a viral vector packaging system). In some embodiments, a prokaryote is used to amplify copies of a vector and express one or more nucleic acids, such as to provide a source of one or more proteins for delivery to a host cell or host organism. Expression of proteins in prokaryotes is most often carried out in Escherichia coli with vectors containing constitutive or inducible promoters directing the expression of either fusion or non-fusion proteins. Fusion vectors add a number of amino acids to a protein encoded therein, such as to the amino terminus of the recombinant protein. Such fusion vectors may serve one or more purposes, such as: (i) to increase expression of recombinant protein; (ii) to increase the solubility of the recombinant protein; and (iii) to aid in the purification of the recombinant protein by acting as a ligand in affinity purification. Often, in fusion expression vectors, a proteolytic cleavage site is introduced at the junction of the fusion moiety and the recombinant protein to enable separation of the recombinant protein from the fusion moiety subsequent to purification of the fusion protein. Such enzymes, and their cognate recognition sequences, include Factor Xa, thrombin and enterokinase. Example fusion expression vectors include pGEX (Pharmacia Biotech Inc; Smith and Johnson, 1988. Gene 67: pMAL (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) and Piscataway, N.J.) that fuse glutathione S-transferase (GST), maltose E binding protein, or protein A, respectively, to the target recombinant protein. Examples of suitable inducible non-fusion E. coli expression vectors include pTrc (Amrann et al., (1988) Gene 69:301-315) and pET 11d (Studier et al., GENE EXPRESSION TECHNOLOGY: METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990) 60-89). In some embodiments, a vector is a yeast expression vector. Examples of vectors for expression in yeast Saccharomyces cerivisae include pYepSecl 1987. Gene 54: (Invitrogen Corporation, San Diego, Calif.), and picZ (InVitrogen Corp, San Diego, Calif.). In some embodiments, a vector drives protein expression in insect cells using baculovirus expression vectors. Baculovirus vectors available for expression of proteins in cultured insect cells (e.g., SF9 cells) include the pAc series (Smith, et al., 1983. Mol. Cell. Biol. 3: 2156-2165) and the pVL series (Lucklow and Summers, 1989. Virology 170: 31-39). In some embodiments, a vector is capable of driving expression of one or more sequences in mammalian cells using a mammalian expression vector. Examples of mammalian expression vectors include pCDM8 (Seed, 1987. Nature 329: 840) and pMT2PC (Kaufman, et al., 1987. EMBO J. 6: 187-195). When used in mammalian cells, the expression vector's control functions are typically provided by one or more regulatory elements. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma, adenovirus 2, cytomegalovirus, simian virus 40, and others disclosed herein and known in the art. For other suitable expression systems for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells see, e.g., Chapters 16 and 17 of Sambrook, et al., MOLECULAR CLONING: A LABORATORY MANUAL. 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989. In some embodiments, the recombinant mammalian expression vector is capable of directing expression of the nucleic acid preferentially in a particular cell type (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory elements are used to express the nucleic acid). Tissue-specific regulatory elements are known in the art. Non-limiting examples of suitable tissue-specific promoters include the albumin promoter (liver-specific; Pinkert, et al., 1987. Genes Dev. 1: (Calame and Eaton, 1988. Adv. Immunol. 43: 235-275), in particular promoters of T cell receptors (Winoto and Baltimore, 1989. EMBO J. 8: 729-733) and immunoglobulins (Baneiji, et al., 1983. Queen and Baltimore, 1983. Cell 33: 741-748), neuron-specific mammary gland-specific promoters (e.g., milk whey promoter; U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,316 and European Application Publication No. 264,166). Developmentally-regulated promoters are also encompassed, e.g., the murine hox promoters (Kessel and Gruss, 1990. Science 249: 374-379) and the -fetoprotein promoter (Campes and Tilghman, 1989. Genes Dev. 3: 537-546). With regards to these prokaryotic and eukaryotic vectors, mention is made of U.S. Pat. No. 6,750,059, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Other embodiments of the invention may relate to the use of viral vectors, with regards to which mention is made of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/092,085, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Tissue-specific regulatory elements are known in the art and in this regard, mention is made of U.S. Pat. No. 7,776,321, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In some embodiments, a regulatory element is operably linked to one or more elements of a CRISPR system so as to drive expression of the one or more elements of the CRISPR system. In general, CRISPRs (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), also known as SPIDRs (SPacer Interspersed Direct Repeats), constitute a family of DNA loci that are usually specific to a particular bacterial species. The CRISPR locus comprises a distinct class of interspersed short sequence repeats (SSRs) that were recognized in E coli (Ishino et al., J. Bacteriol., 169:5429-5433 [1987]; and Nakata et al., J. Bacteriol., 171:3553-3556 [1989]), and associated genes. Similar interspersed in Haloferax mediterranei, Streptococcus loci typically differ from other SSRs by the structure of the repeats, which have been termed short regularly spaced repeats (SRSRs) (Janssen et al., OMICS J. [2000]). In general, the repeats are short elements that occur in clusters that are regularly spaced by unique intervening sequences with a substantially constant length (Mojica et al., [2000], supra). Although the repeat sequences are highly conserved between strains, the number of interspersed repeats and the sequences of the spacer regions typically differ from strain to strain (van Embden et al., J. Bacteriol., 182:2393-2401 [2000]). CRISPR loci have been identified in more than 40 prokaryotes (See e.g., Jansen et al., Mol. Microbiol., 43:1565-1575 [2002]; and Mojica et the context of an endogenous nucleic acid-targeting system, formation of a nucleic acid-targeting complex (comprising a guide RNA hybridized to a target sequence and complexed with one or more nucleic acid-targeting effector modules) results in cleavage of one or both RNA strands in or near (e.g. within 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 50, or more base pairs from) the target sequence. In some embodiments, one or more vectors driving expression of one or more elements of a nucleic acid-targeting system are introduced into a host cell such that expression of the elements of the nucleic acid-targeting system direct formation of a nucleic acid-targeting complex at one or more target sites. For example, a nucleic acid-targeting effector module and a guide RNA could each be operably linked to separate regulatory elements on separate vectors. Alternatively, two or more of the elements expressed from the same or different regulatory elements, may be combined in a single vector, with one or more additional vectors providing any components of the nucleic acid-targeting system not included in the first vector. nucleic acid-targeting system elements that are combined in a single vector may be arranged in any suitable orientation, such as one element located 5 with respect to (\"upstream\" of) or 3 with respect to (\"downstream\" of) a second element. The coding sequence of one element may be located on the same or opposite strand of the coding sequence of a second element, and oriented in the same or opposite direction. In some embodiments, a single promoter drives expression of a transcript encoding a nucleic acid-targeting effector module and a guide RNA embedded within one or more intron sequences (e.g. each in a different intron, two or more in at least one intron, or all in a single intron). In some embodiments, the nucleic acid-targeting effector module and guide RNA are operably linked to and expressed from the same promoter. In certain aspects the invention involves vectors. A used herein, a \"vector\" is a tool that allows or facilitates the transfer of an entity from one environment to another. It is a replicon, such as a plasmid, phage, or cosmid, into which another DNA segment may be inserted so as to bring about the replication of the inserted segment. Generally, a vector is capable of replication when associated with the proper control elements. In general, the term \"vector\" refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. Vectors include, but are not limited to, nucleic acid molecules that are single-stranded, double-stranded, or partially double-stranded; nucleic acid molecules that comprise one or more free ends, no free ends (e.g. circular); nucleic acid molecules that comprise DNA, RNA, or both; and other varieties of polynucleotides known in the art. One type of vector is a \"plasmid,\" which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments can be inserted, such as by standard molecular cloning techniques. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein virally-derived DNA or RNA sequences are present in the vector for packaging into a virus (e.g. retroviruses, replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses, replication defective adenoviruses, and adeno-associated viruses (AAVs)). Viral vectors also include polynucleotides carried by a virus for transfection into a host cell. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g. bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively-linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as \"expression vectors.\" Common expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. Conventional viral and non-viral based gene transfer methods can be used to introduce nucleic acids in mammalian cells or target tissues. Such methods can be used to administer nucleic acids encoding components of a nucleic acid-targeting system to cells in culture, or in a host organism. Non-viral vector delivery systems include DNA plasmids, RNA (e.g. a transcript of a vector described herein), naked nucleic acid, and nucleic acid complexed with a delivery vehicle, such as a liposome. Viral vector delivery systems include DNA and RNA viruses, which have either episomal or integrated genomes after delivery to the cell. For a review of gene therapy procedures, see Anderson, Science 256:808-813 51(1):31-44 (1995); Haddada et al., in Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology, Doerfler and Bohm (eds) (1995); and Yu et al., Gene Therapy 1:13-26 (1994). Methods of non-viral delivery virions, and agent-enhanced uptake of DNA. Lipofection is described in e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,049,386, 4,946,787; and 4,897,355) and lipofection reagents are Transfectam and Lipofectin) Cationic and neutral lipids that are suitable for efficient receptor-recognition lipofection of polynucleotides include those of Felgner, WO 91/17424; WO 91/16024. Delivery can be to cells (e.g. in vitro or ex vivo administration) or target tissues (e.g. in vivo administration). Plasmid delivery involves the cloning of a guide RNA into a CRISPR effector protein expressing plasmid and transfecting the DNA in cell culture. Plasmid backbones are available commercially and no specific equipment is required. They have the advantage of being modular, capable of carrying different sizes of CRISPR effector coding sequences (including those encoding larger sized proteins) as well as selection markers. Both an advantage of plasmids is that they can ensure transient, but sustained expression. However, delivery of plasmids is not straightforward such that in vivo efficiency is often low. The sustained expression can also be disadvantageous in that it can increase off-target editing. In addition excess build-up of the CRISPR effector protein can be toxic to the cells. Finally, plasmids always hold the risk of random integration of the dsDNA in the host genome, more particularly in view of the double-stranded breaks being generated (on and off-target). The preparation of lipid:nucleic acid complexes, including targeted liposomes such as immunolipid complexes, is well known to one of skill in the art (see, e.g., Crystal, Science 270:404-410 (1995); Blaese et al., Cancer Gao et al., Gene Therapy 2:710-722 (1995); Ahmad et al., Cancer Res. is discussed more in detail below.

The use of RNA or DNA viral based systems for the delivery of nucleic acids takes advantage of highly evolved processes for targeting a virus to specific cells in the body and trafficking the viral payload to the nucleus. Viral vectors can be administered directly to patients (in vivo) or they can be used to treat cells in vitro, and the modified cells may optionally be administered to patients (ex vivo). Conventional viral based systems could include retroviral, lentivirus, adenoviral, adeno-associated and herpes simplex virus vectors for gene transfer. Integration in the host genome is possible with the retrovirus, lentivirus, and adeno-associated virus gene transfer methods, often resulting in long term expression of the inserted transgene. Additionally, high transduction efficiencies have been observed in many different cell types and target tissues. The tropism of a retrovirus can be altered by incorporating foreign envelope proteins, expanding the potential target population of target cells. Lentiviral vectors are retroviral vectors that are able to transduce or infect non-dividing cells and typically produce high viral titers. Selection of a retroviral gene transfer system would therefore depend on the target tissue. Retroviral vectors are comprised of cis-acting long terminal repeats with packaging capacity for up to 6-10 kb of foreign sequence. The minimum cis-acting LTRs are sufficient for replication and packaging of the vectors, which are then used to integrate the therapeutic gene into the target cell to provide permanent transgene expression. Widely used retroviral vectors include those based upon murine leukemia virus (MuLV), gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV), Simian Immuno deficiency virus (SIV), human immuno deficiency virus (HIV), and combinations thereof (see, e.g., Buchscher et al., J. Virol. al., J. Virol. 65:2220-2224 (1991); PCT/US94/05700). In applications where transient expression is preferred, adenoviral based systems may be used. Adenoviral based vectors are capable of very high transduction efficiency in many cell types and do not require cell division. With such vectors, high titer and levels of expression have been obtained. This vector can be produced in large quantities in a relatively simple system. Adeno-associated virus (\"AAV\") vectors may also be used to transduce cells with target nucleic acids, e.g., in the in vitro production of nucleic acids and peptides, and for in vivo and ex vivo gene therapy procedures (see, e.g., West et al., Virology 160:38-47 (1987); U.S. Pat. No. 4,797,368; WO 5:793-801 (1994); Muzyczka, J. Clin. Invest. 94:1351 (1994). Construction of recombinant AAV vectors are described in a number of publications, including U.S. Pat. No. 5,173,414; Tratschin et Mol. J. Virol. 63:03822-3828 (1989). The invention provides AAV that contains or consists essentially of an exogenous nucleic acid molecule encoding a CRISPR system, e.g., a plurality of cassettes comprising or consisting a first cassette comprising or consisting essentially of a promoter, a nucleic acid molecule encoding a CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein (putative nuclease or helicase proteins), e.g., Cpf1 and a terminator, and a two, or more, advantageously up to the packaging size limit of the vector, e.g., in total (including the first cassette) five, cassettes comprising or consisting essentially of a promoter, nucleic acid molecule encoding guide RNA (gRNA) and a terminator (e.g., each cassette schematically represented as Promoter-gRNA1-terminator, Promoter-gRNA2-terminator . . . Promoter-gRNA(N)-terminator (where N is a number that can be inserted that is at an upper limit of the packaging size limit of the vector), or two or more individual rAAVs, each containing one or more than one cassette of a CRISPR system, e.g., a first rAAV containing the first cassette comprising or consisting essentially of a promoter, a nucleic acid molecule encoding Cas, e.g., Cas (Cpf1) and a terminator, and a second rAAV containing a plurality, four, cassettes comprising or consisting essentially of a promoter, nucleic acid molecule encoding guide RNA (gRNA) and a terminator (e.g., each cassette schematically represented as Promoter-gRNAl-terminator, Promoter-gRNA2-terminator . . . Promoter-gRNA(N)-terminator (where N is a number that can be inserted that is at an upper limit of the packaging size limit of the vector). As rAAV is a DNA virus, the nucleic acid molecules in the herein discussion concerning AAV or rAAV are advantageously DNA. The promoter is in some embodiments advantageously human Synapsin I promoter (hSyn). Additional methods for the delivery of nucleic acids to cells are known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, US20030087817, incorporated herein by reference. In another embodiment, Cocal vesiculovirus envelope pseudotyped retroviral vector particles are contemplated (see, e.g., US Patent Publication No. 20120164118 assigned to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center). Cocal virus is in the Vesiculovirus genus, and is a causative agent of vesicular stomatitis in mammals. Cocal virus was originally isolated from mites in Trinidad (Jonkers et al., Am. J. Vet. Res. 25:236-242 (1964)), and infections have been identified in Trinidad, Brazil, and Argentina from insects, cattle, and horses. Many of the vesiculoviruses that infect mammals have been isolated from naturally infected arthropods, suggesting that they are vector-borne. Antibodies to vesiculoviruses are common among people living in rural areas where the viruses are endemic and laboratory-acquired; infections in humans usually result in influenza-like symptoms. The Cocal virus envelope glycoprotein shares 71.5% identity at the amino acid level with VSV-G Indiana, and phylogenetic comparison of the envelope gene of vesiculoviruses shows that Cocal virus is serologically distinct from, but most closely related to, VSV-G Indiana strains among the vesiculoviruses. Jonkers et al., Am. J. Vet. Res. 25:236-242 (1964) and Travassos da Rosa et al., Am. J. Tropical Med. & Hygiene 33:999-1006 (1984). The Cocal vesiculovirus envelope pseudotyped retroviral alpharetroviral, betaretroviral, gammaretroviral, deltaretroviral, and epsilonretroviral vector particles that may comprise retroviral Gag, Pol, and/or one or more accessory protein(s) and a Cocal vesiculovirus envelope protein. Within certain aspects of these embodiments, the Gag, Pol, and accessory proteins are lentiviral and/or gammaretroviral. In some embodiments, a host cell is transiently or non-transiently transfected with one or more vectors described herein. In some embodiments, a cell is transfected as it naturally occurs in a subject optionally to be reintroduced therein. In some embodiments, a cell that is transfected is taken from a subject. In some embodiments, the cell is derived from cells taken from a subject, such as a cell line. A wide variety of cell lines for tissue culture are known in the art. Examples of cell lines include, but are not limited and transgenic varieties thereof. Cell lines are available from a variety of sources known to those with skill in the art (see, e.g., the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, Va.)). In some embodiments, a cell transfected with one or more vectors described herein is used to establish a new cell line comprising one or more vector-derived sequences. In some embodiments, a cell transiently transfected with the components of a CRISPR system as described herein (such as by transient transfection of one or more vectors, or transfection with RNA), and modified through the activity of a CRISPR complex, is used to establish a new cell line comprising cells containing the modification but lacking any other exogenous sequence. In some embodiments, cells transiently or non-transiently transfected with one or more vectors described herein, or cell lines derived from such cells are used in assessing one or more test compounds. In some embodiments it is envisaged to introduce the RNA and/or protein directly to the host cell. For instance, the CRISPR effector can be delivered as CRISPR effector-encoding mRNA together with an in vitro transcribed guide RNA. Such methods can reduce the time to ensure effect of the CRISPR effector protein and further prevents long-term expression of the CRISPR system components. In some embodiments the RNA molecules of the invention are delivered in liposome or lipofectin formulations and the like and can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Such methods are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,593,972, 5,589,466, and 5,580,859, which are herein incorporated by reference. Delivery systems aimed specifically at the enhanced and improved delivery of siRNA into mammalian cells have been developed, (see, for example, Shen et al FEBS Let. 2003, 539:111-114; Xia et al., Nat. Biotech. 2002, 20:1006-1010; Reich et al., Mol. Vision. 2003, 9: al., J. Mol. Biol. 2003, et al., Nat. Gen. 2002, 32: 107-108 and Simeoni et al., NAR 2003, 31, 11: 2717-2724) and may be applied to the present invention. siRNA has recently been successfully used for inhibition of gene expression in primates (see for example. Tolentino et al., Retina 24(4):660 which may also be applied to the present invention. Indeed, RNA delivery is a useful method of in vivo delivery. It is possible to deliver Cpf1 and gRNA (and, for instance, HR repair template) into cells using liposomes or nanoparticles. Thus delivery of the CRISPR enzyme, such as a Cpf1 and/or delivery of the RNAs of the invention may be in RNA form and via microvesicles, liposomes or particle or particles. For example, Cpf1 mRNA and gRNA can be packaged into liposomal particles delivery in vivo. Liposomal transfection reagents such as lipofectamine from Life Technologies and other reagents on the market can effectively deliver RNA molecules into the liver. Means of delivery of RNA also preferred include delivery of RNA via particles (Cho, S., Goldberg, M., Son, S., Xu, Q., Yang, F., Mei, Y., Bogatyrev, S., Langer, R. and Anderson, D., Lipid-like nanoparticles for small interfering RNA delivery to endothelial cells, Advanced Functional Materials, 19: 3112-3118, 2010) or exosomes (Schroeder, A., Levins, C., Cortez, Langer, R., and Anderson, D., Lipid-based nanotherapeutics for siRNA delivery, Journal of Internal Medicine, 267: 9-21, 2010, PMID: 20059641). Indeed, exosomes have been shown to be particularly useful in delivery siRNA, a system with some parallels to the CRISPR system. For instance, El-Andaloussi S, et al. (\"Exosome-mediated delivery of siRNA in vitro 2012 December; doi: 10.1038/nprot.2012.131. Epub 2012 Nov. 15.) describe how exosomes are promising tools for drug delivery across different biological barriers and can be harnessed for delivery of siRNA in vitro and in vivo. Their approach is to generate targeted exosomes through transfection of an expression vector, comprising an exosomal protein fused with a peptide ligand. The exosomes are then purify and characterized from transfected cell supernatant, then RNA is loaded into the exosomes. Delivery or administration according to the invention can be performed with exosomes, in particular but not limited to the brain. Vitamin E (-tocopherol) may be conjugated with CRISPR Cas and delivered to the brain along with high density lipoprotein (HDL), for example in a similar manner as was done by Uno et al. (HUMAN GENE THERAPY 22:711-719 (June 2011)) for delivering short-interfering RNA (siRNA) to the brain. Mice were infused via Osmotic minipumps (model 1007D; Alzet, Cupertino, Calif.) filled with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or free TocsiBACE or Toc-siBACE/HDL and connected with Brain Infusion Kit 3 (Alzet). A brain-infusion cannula was placed about 0.5 mm posterior to the bregma at midline for infusion into the dorsal third ventricle. Uno et al. found that as little as 3 nmol of Toc-siRNA with HDL could induce a target reduction in comparable degree by the same ICV infusion method. A similar dosage of CRISPR Cas conjugated to -tocopherol and co-administered with HDL targeted to the brain may be contemplated for humans in the present invention, for example, about 3 nmol to about 3 mol of CRISPR Cas targeted to the brain may be contemplated. Zou et al. ((HUMAN GENE THERAPY 22:465-475 (April 2011)) describes a method of lentiviral-mediated delivery of short-hairpin RNAs targeting PKC for in vivo gene silencing in the spinal cord of rats. Zou et al. administered about 10 l of a recombinant lentivirus having a titer of 1\u00d710 transducing units (TU)/ml by an intrathecal catheter. A similar dosage of CRISPR Cas expressed in a lentiviral vector targeted to the brain may be contemplated for humans in the present invention, for example, about 10-50 ml of CRISPR Cas targeted to the brain in a lentivirus having a titer of 1\u00d710 transducing units (TU)/ml may be contemplated. Vector delivery, e.g., plasmid, viral delivery: The CRISPR enzyme, for instance a Cpf1, and/or any of the present RNAs, for instance a guide RNA, can be delivered using any suitable vector, e.g., plasmid or viral vectors, such as adeno associated virus (AAV), lentivirus, adenovirus or other viral vector types, or combinations thereof. Cpf1 and one or more guide RNAs can be packaged into one or more vectors, e.g., plasmid or viral vectors. In some embodiments, the vector, e.g., plasmid or viral vector is delivered to the tissue of interest by, for example, an intramuscular injection, while other times the delivery is via intravenous, transdermal, intranasal, oral, mucosal, or other delivery methods. Such delivery may be either via a single dose, or multiple doses. One skilled in the art understands that the actual dosage to be delivered herein may vary greatly depending upon a variety of factors, such as the vector choice, the target cell, organism, or tissue, the general condition of the subject to be treated, the degree of transformation/modification sought, the administration route, the administration mode, the type of transformation/modification sought, etc. Such a dosage may further contain, for example, a carrier (water, saline, ethanol, glycerol, lactose, sucrose, calcium phosphate, gelatin, dextran, agar, pectin, peanut oil, sesame oil, etc.), a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier (e.g., phosphate-buffered saline), a pharmaceutically-acceptable excipient, and/or other compounds known in the art. The dosage may further contain one or more pharmaceutically acceptable salts such as, for example, a mineral acid salt such as a hydrochloride, a hydrobromide, a phosphate, a sulfate, etc.; and the salts of organic acids such as acetates, propionates, malonates, benzoates, etc. Additionally, auxiliary substances, such as or emulsifying agents, pH buffering substances, gels or gelling materials, flavorings, colorants, microspheres, polymers, suspension agents, etc. may also be present herein. In addition, one or more other conventional pharmaceutical ingredients, such as preservatives, humectants, suspending agents, surfactants, antioxidants, anticaking agents, fillers, chelating agents, coating agents, chemical stabilizers, etc. may also be present, especially if the dosage form is a reconstitutable form. Suitable exemplary ingredients include microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, polysorbate 80, phenylethyl phenol, parachlorophenol, gelatin, and a combination thereof. A thorough discussion of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients is available in REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES (Mack Pub. Co., N.J. 1991) which is incorporated by reference herein. In an embodiment herein the delivery is via an adenovirus, which may be at a single booster dose containing at least 1\u00d710 particles (also referred to as particle units, pu) of adenoviral vector. In an embodiment herein, the dose preferably is at least about 1\u00d7106 particles (for example, about 1\u00d7106-1\u00d71012 particles), more preferably at least about 1\u00d7107 particles, more preferably at least about 1\u00d710 particles (e.g., about 1\u00d7108-1\u00d7101 particles or about 1\u00d7108-1\u00d71012 particles), and preferably at least about 1\u00d7100 particles (e.g., about 1\u00d7109-1\u00d710 particles or about 1\u00d7109-1\u00d71012 particles), or even at least about 1\u00d71010 particles (e.g., about 1\u00d71010-1\u00d71012 particles) of the adenoviral vector. Alternatively, the dose comprises no more than about 1\u00d71014 particles, preferably no more than about 1\u00d71013 particles, even more preferably no more than about 1\u00d71012 particles, even more preferably no more than about 1\u00d71011 particles, and preferably no more than about 1\u00d71010 particles (e.g., no more than about 1\u00d710 articles). Thus, the dose may contain a single dose of adenoviral vector with, for example, about 1\u00d7106 particle units (pu), about 2\u00d7106 pu, about 4\u00d7106 pu, about 1\u00d710 pu, about 2\u00d710 pu, about 4\u00d710 pu, about 1\u00d710 pu, about 2\u00d710 pu, about 4\u00d710 pu, about 1\u00d7109 pu, about 2\u00d7109 pu, about 4\u00d7109 pu, about 1\u00d71010 pu, about 2\u00d71010 pu, about 4\u00d71010 pu, about 1\u00d71011 pu, about 2\u00d71011 pu, about 4\u00d71011 pu, about 1\u00d71012 pu, about 2\u00d71012 pu, or about 4\u00d71012 pu of adenoviral vector. See, for example, the adenoviral vectors in U.S. Pat. No. 8,454,972 B2 to Nabel, et. al., granted on Jun. 4, 2013; incorporated by reference herein, and the dosages at col 29, lines 36-58 thereof. In an embodiment herein, the adenovirus is delivered via multiple doses. In an embodiment herein, the delivery is via an AAV. A therapeutically effective dosage for in vivo delivery of the AAV to a human is believed to be in the range of from about 20 to about 50 ml of saline solution containing from about 1\u00d71010 to about 1\u00d7110 functional AAV/ml solution. The dosage may be adjusted to balance the therapeutic benefit against any side effects. In an embodiment herein, the AAV dose is generally in the range of concentrations of from about 1\u00d7105 to 1\u00d71050 genomes AAV, from about 1\u00d7108 to AAV, about 1\u00d71010 to genomes, or about 1\u00d71011 to about 1\u00d71016 genomes AAV. A human dosage may be about 1\u00d71013 genomes AAV. Such concentrations may be delivered in from about 0.001 ml to about 100 ml, about 0.05 to about 50 ml, or about 10 to about 25 ml of a carrier solution. Other effective dosages can be readily established by one of ordinary skill in the art through routine trials establishing dose response curves. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,404,658 B2 to Hajjar, et al., granted on Mar. 26, 2013, at col. 27, lines 45-60. Among vectors that may be used in the practice of the invention, integration in the host genome of a cell is possible with retrovirus gene transfer methods, often resulting in long term expression of the inserted transgene. In a preferred embodiment the retrovirus is a lentivirus. Additionally, high transduction efficiencies have been observed in many different cell types and target tissues. The tropism of a retrovirus can be altered by incorporating foreign envelope proteins, expanding the potential target population of target cells. A retrovirus can also be engineered to allow for conditional expression of the inserted transgene, such that only certain cell types are infected by the lentivirus. Cell type specific promoters can be used to target expression in specific cell types. Lentiviral vectors are retroviral vectors (and hence both lentiviral and retroviral vectors may be used in the practice of the invention). Moreover, lentiviral vectors are preferred as they are able to transduce or infect non-dividing cells and typically produce high viral titers. Selection of a retroviral gene transfer system may therefore depend on the target tissue. Retroviral vectors are comprised of cis-acting long terminal repeats with packaging capacity for up to 6-10 kb of foreign sequence. The minimum cis-acting LTRs are sufficient for replication and packaging of the vectors, which are then used to integrate the desired nucleic acid into the target cell to provide permanent expression. Widely used retroviral vectors that may be used in the practice of the invention include those based upon murine leukemia virus (MuLV), gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV), Simian Immuno deficiency virus (SIV), human immuno deficiency virus (HIV), and combinations thereof (see, e.g., Buchscher et al., (1992) J. Virol. 66:2731-2739; Johann et al., J. Virol. 66:1635-1640; Sommnerfelt et al., (1990) Virol. 176:58-59; Wilson et al., (1998) J. Virol. 63:2374-2378; Miller et al., (1991) J. Virol. 65:2220-2224; PCT/US94/05700). Zou et al. administered about 10 l of a recombinant lentivirus having a titer of 1\u00d7109 transducing units (TU)/ml by an intrathecal catheter. These sort of dosages can be adapted or extrapolated to use of a retroviral or lentiviral vector in the present invention.Vector Packaging of Cpf1 Ways to package inventive Cpf1 coding nucleic acid molecules, e.g., DNA, into vectors, e.g., viral vectors, to mediate genome modification in vivo include: - - To achieve NHEJ-mediated gene knockout: - Single virus vector: - Vector containing two or more expression cassettes: - Promoter-Cpf1 coding nucleic acid molecule-terminator - Promoter-gRNA1-terminator - Promoter-gRNA2-terminator - Promoter-gRNA(N)-terminator (up to size limit of vector) - Double virus vector: - Vector 1 containing one expression cassette for driving the expression of Cpf1 - Promoter-Cpf1 coding nucleic acid molecule-terminator - Vector 2 containing one more expression cassettes for driving the expression of one or more guideRNAs - Promoter-gRNA1-terminator - Promoter-gRNA(N)-terminator (up to size limit of vector) - To mediate homology-directed repair. - In addition to the single and double virus vector approaches described above, an additional vector can be used to deliver a homology-direct repair template. The promoter used to drive Cpf1 coding nucleic acid molecule expression can include: - - AAV ITR can serve as a promoter: this is advantageous for eliminating the need for an additional promoter element (which can take up space in the vector). The additional space freed up can be used to drive the expression of additional elements (gRNA, etc.). Also, ITR activity is relatively weaker, so can be used to reduce potential toxicity due to over expression of Cpf1. - For ubiquitous expression, promoters that can be used include: CMV, CAG, CBh, PGK, SV40, Ferritin heavy or light chains, etc. For brain or other CNS expression, can use promoters: SynapsinI for all neurons, CaMKIIalpha excitatory neurons, GAD67 or GAD65 or VGAT for GABAergic neurons, etc. For liver expression, can use Albumin promoter. For lung expression, can use SP-B. For endothelial cells, can use ICAM. For hematopoietic cells can use IFNbeta or CD45. For Osteoblasts can one can use the OG-2. The promoter used to drive guide RNA can include: - - Pol III promoters such as U6 or H1 - Use of Pol II promoter and intronic cassettes to express gRNA Cpf1 and one or more guide RNA can be delivered using adeno associated virus (AAV), lentivirus, adenovirus or other plasmid or viral vector types, in particular, using formulations and doses from, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,454,972 (formulations, doses for adenovirus), U.S. Pat. No. 8,404,658 (formulations, doses for AAV) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,946 (formulations, doses for DNA plasmids) and from clinical trials and publications regarding the clinical trials involving lentivirus, AAV and adenovirus. For examples, for AAV, the route of administration, formulation and dose can be as in U.S. Pat. No. 8,454,972 and as in clinical trials involving AAV. For Adenovirus, the route of administration, formulation and dose can be as in U.S. Pat. No. 8,404,658 and as in clinical trials involving adenovirus. For plasmid delivery, the route of administration, formulation and dose can be as in U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,946 and as in clinical studies involving plasmids. Doses may be based on or extrapolated to an average 70 kg individual (e.g. a male adult human), and can be adjusted for patients, subjects, mammals of different weight and species. Frequency of administration is within the ambit of the medical or veterinary practitioner (e.g., physician, veterinarian), depending on usual factors including the age, sex, general health, other conditions of the patient or subject and the particular condition or symptoms being addressed. The viral vectors can be injected into the tissue of interest. For cell-type specific genome modification, the expression of Cpf1 can be driven by a cell-type specific promoter. For example, liver-specific expression might use the Albumin promoter and neuron-specific expression (e.g. for targeting CNS disorders) might use the Synapsin I promoter. In terms of in vivo delivery, AAV is advantageous over other viral vectors for a couple of reasons: - - Low toxicity (this may be due to the purification method not requiring ultra centrifugation of cell particles that can activate the immune response) and - Low probability of causing insertional mutagenesis because it doesn't integrate into the host genome. AAV has a packaging limit of 4.5 or 4.75 Kb. This means that Cpf1 as well as a promoter and transcription terminator may need to be all fit into the same viral vector. Constructs larger than 4.5 or 4.75 Kb will lead to significantly reduced virus production. SpCas9 is quite large, the gene itself is over 4.1 Kb, which makes it difficult for packing into AAV. Therefore embodiments of the invention include utilizing homologs of Cpf1 that are shorter. For example: rAAV vectors are preferably produced in insect cells, e.g., Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells, grown in serum-free suspension culture. Serum-free insect cells can be purchased from commercial vendors, e.g., Sigma Aldrich (EX-CELL 405). These species are therefore, in general, preferred Cpf1 species. As to AAV, the AAV can be AAV1, AAV2, AAV5 or any combination thereof. One can select the AAV of the AAV with regard to the cells to be targeted; e.g., one can select AAV serotypes 1, 2, 5 or a hybrid capsid AAV1, AAV2, AAV5 or any combination thereof for targeting brain or neuronal cells; and one can select AAV4 for targeting cardiac tissue. AAV8 is useful for delivery to the liver. The herein promoters and vectors are preferred individually. A tabulation of certain AAV serotypes as to these cells (see Grimm, D. et al, J. Virol. 82: 5887-5911 (2008)) is as follows: Lentiviruses are complex retroviruses that have the ability to infect and express their genes in both mitotic and post-mitotic cells. The commonly known lentivirus is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which uses the envelope glycoproteins of other viruses to target a broad range of cell types. Lentiviruses may be prepared as follows. After cloning pCasES10 (which contains a lentiviral transfer plasmid backbone), HEK293FT at low passage (p=5) were seeded in a T-75 flask to 50% confluence the day before transfection in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and without antibiotics. After 20 hours, media was changed to OptiMEM (serum-free) media and transfection was done 4 hours later. Cells were transfected with 10 g of lentiviral transfer plasmid (pCasES10) and the following packaging plasmids: 5 pseudotype), and 7.5 ug psPAX2 (gag/pol/rev/tat). done in 4 mL with a cationic lipid delivery agent (50 uL Lipofectamine 2000 and 100 ul Plus reagent). After 6 hours, the media was changed to antibiotic-free DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. These methods use serum during cell culture, but serum-free methods are preferred. Lentivirus may be purified as follows. Viral supernatants were harvested after 48 hours. Supernatants were first cleared of debris and filtered through a 0.45 um low protein binding (PVDF) filter. They were then spun in a ultracentrifuge for 2 hours at 24,000 rpm. Viral pellets were resuspended in 50 ul of DMEM overnight at 4C. They were then aliquotted and immediately frozen at 80\u00b0 C. In another embodiment, minimal non-primate lentiviral vectors based on the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) are also contemplated, especially for ocular gene therapy (see, e.g., Balagaan, J Gene Med 2006; 8: 275-285). an equine lentiviral gene therapy vector that expresses angiostatic proteins endostatin and angiostatin that is delivered via a subretinal injection for the treatment of the web form of age-related macular degeneration is also contemplated (see, e.g., Binley et al., HUMAN GENE THERAPY 23:980-991 (September 2012)) and this vector may be modified for the CRISPR-Cas system of the present invention. In another embodiment, self-inactivating lentiviral vectors with an siRNA targeting a common exon shared by HIV tat/rev, a nucleolar-localizing TAR decoy, and an anti-CCR5-specific hammerhead ribozyme e.g., DiGiusto et al. (2010) Sci Transl Med 2:36ra43) may be used/and or adapted to the CRISPR-Cas system of the present invention. A minimum of 2.5\u00d7106 CD34+ cells per kilogram patient weight may be collected and prestimulated for 16 to 20 hours in X-VIVO 15 medium (Lonza) containing 2 mol/L-glutamine, stem cell cells/ml. cells may be transduced with lentiviral at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for 16 to 24 hours in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks coated with fibronectin (25 mg/cm2) (RetroNectin, Takara Bio Inc.). Lentiviral vectors have been disclosed as in the treatment for Parkinson's Disease, see, e.g., US Patent Publication No. 20120295960 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,303,910 and 7,351,585. Lentiviral vectors have also been disclosed for the treatment of ocular diseases, see e.g., US Patent Publication Nos. 20060281180, 20090007284, US20110117189; US20090017543; US20070054961, US20100317109. Lentiviral vectors have also been disclosed for delivery to the brain, see, e.g., US Patent Publication Nos. US20110293571; US20110293571, US20040013648, US20070025970, US20090111106 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,259,015. Use of Minimal Promoters The present application provides a vector for delivering an effector protein and at least one CRISPR guide RNA to a cell comprising a minimal promoter operably linked to a polynucleotide sequence encoding the effector protein and a second minimal promoter operably linked to a polynucleotide sequence encoding at least one guide RNA, wherein the length of the vector sequence comprising the minimal promoters and polynucleotide sequences is less than 4.4Kb. In an embodiment, the vector is an AAV vector. In another embodiment, the effector protein is a CRISPR anzyme. Cpf1, Cas13b or C2c2. In a related aspect, the invention provides a lentiviral vector for delivering an effector protein and at least one CRISPR guide RNA to a cell comprising a promoter operably linked to a polynucleotide sequence encoding Cpf1 and a second promoter operably linked to a polynucleotide sequence encoding at least one guide RNA, wherein the polynucleotide sequences are in reverse orientation. In another aspect, the invention provides a method of expressing an effector protein and guide RNA in a cell comprising introducing the vector according any of the vector delivery systems disclosed herein. In an embodiment of the vector for delivering an effector protein, the minimnal promoter is the Mecp2 promoter, tRNA promoter, or U6. In a further embodiment, the minimal promoter is tissue specific.Dosage of Vectors In some embodiments, the vector, e.g., plasmid or viral vector is delivered to the tissue of interest by, for example, an intramuscular injection, while other times the delivery is via intravenous, transdermal, intranasal, oral, mucosal, or other delivery methods. Such delivery may be either via a single dose, or multiple doses. One skilled in the art understands that the actual dosage to be delivered herein may vary greatly depending upon a variety of factors, such as the vector choice, the target cell, organism, or tissue, the general condition of the subject to be treated, the degree of transformation/modification sought, the administration route, the administration mode, the type of transformation/modification sought, etc. Such a dosage may further contain, for example, a carrier (water, saline, ethanol, glycerol, lactose, sucrose, calcium phosphate, gelatin, dextran, agar, pectin, peanut oil, sesame oil, etc.), a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier (e.g., phosphate-buffered saline), a pharmaceutically-acceptable excipient, and/or other compounds known in the art. The dosage may further contain one or more pharmaceutically acceptable salts such as, for example, a mineral acid salt such as a hydrochloride, a hydrobromide, a phosphate, a sulfate, etc.; and the salts of organic acids such as acetates, propionates, malonates, benzoates, etc. Additionally, auxiliary substances, such as or emulsifying agents, pH buffering substances, gels or gelling materials, flavorings, colorants, microspheres, polymers, suspension agents, etc. may also be present herein. In addition, one or more other conventional pharmaceutical ingredients, such as preservatives, humectants, suspending agents, surfactants, antioxidants, anticaking agents, fillers, chelating agents, coating agents, chemical stabilizers, etc. may also be present, especially if the dosage form is a reconstitutable form. Suitable exemplary ingredients include microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, polysorbate 80, phenylethyl phenol, parachlorophenol, gelatin, and a combination thereof. A thorough discussion of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients is available in REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES (Mack Pub. Co., N.J. 1991) which is incorporated by reference herein. In an embodiment herein the delivery is via an adenovirus, which may be at a single booster dose containing at least 1\u00d7105 particles (also referred to as particle units, pu) of adenoviral vector. In an embodiment herein, the dose preferably is at least about 1\u00d7106 particles (for example, about 1\u00d7106-1\u00d71012 particles), more preferably at least about 1\u00d7107 particles, more preferably at least about 1\u00d7106 particles (e.g., about 1\u00d7108-1\u00d71011 particles or about 1\u00d710-1\u00d71012 particles), and preferably at least about 1\u00d7100 particles (e.g., about 1\u00d7109-1\u00d71010 particles or about 1\u00d7109-1\u00d71012 particles), or even at least about 1\u00d71010 particles (e.g., about 1\u00d71010-1\u00d71012 particles) of the adenoviral vector. Alternatively, the dose comprises no more than about 1\u00d71014 particles, preferably no more than about 1\u00d71013 particles, even more preferably no more than about 1\u00d71012 particles, even more preferably no more than about 1\u00d71011 particles, and preferably no more than about 1\u00d71010 particles (e.g., no more than about 1\u00d7109 articles). Thus, the dose may contain a single dose of adenoviral vector with, for example, about 1\u00d7106 particle units (pu), about 2\u00d7106 pu, about 4\u00d7106 pu, about 1\u00d7107 pu, about 2\u00d7107 pu, about 4\u00d7107 pu, about 1\u00d7108 pu, about 2\u00d7108 pu, about 4\u00d710 pu, about 1\u00d7109 pu, about 2\u00d7109 pu, about 4\u00d7109 pu, about 1\u00d71010 pu, about 2\u00d71010 pu, about 4\u00d71010 pu, about 1\u00d71011 pu, about 2\u00d71011 pu, about 4\u00d71011 pu, about 1\u00d71012 pu, about 2\u00d71012 pu, or about 4\u00d71012 pu of adenoviral vector. See, for example, the adenoviral vectors in U.S. Pat. No. 8,454,972 B2 to Nabel, et. al., granted on Jun. 4, 2013; incorporated by reference herein, and the dosages at col 29, lines 36-58 thereof. In an embodiment herein, the adenovirus is delivered via multiple doses. In an embodiment herein, the delivery is via an AAV. A therapeutically effective dosage for in vivo delivery of the AAV to a human is believed to be in the range of from about 20 to about 50 ml of saline solution containing from about 1\u00d71010 to about 1\u00d71010 functional AAV/ml solution. The dosage may be adjusted to balance the therapeutic benefit against any side effects. In an embodiment herein, the AAV dose is generally in the range of concentrations of from about 1\u00d7105 to 1\u00d71050 genomes AAV, from about 1\u00d7108 to AAV, about 1\u00d71010 to genomes, or about 1\u00d71011 to about 1\u00d71016 genomes AAV. A human dosage may be about 1\u00d71013 genomes AAV. Such concentrations may be delivered in from about 0.001 ml to about 100 ml, about 0.05 to about 50 ml, or about 10 to about 25 ml of a carrier solution. Other effective dosages can be readily established by one of ordinary skill in the art through routine trials establishing dose response curves. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,404,658 B2 to Hajjar, et al., granted on Mar. 26, 2013, at col. 27, lines 45-60. In an embodiment herein the delivery is via a plasmid. In such plasmid compositions, the dosage should be a sufficient amount of plasmid to elicit a response. For instance, suitable quantities of plasmid DNA in plasmid compositions can be from about 0.1 to about 2 mg, or from about 1 g to about 10 g per 70 kg individual. Plasmids of the invention will generally comprise (i) a promoter; (ii) a sequence encoding a CRISPR enzyme, operably linked to said promoter; (iii) a selectable marker; (iv) an origin of replication; and (v) a transcription terminator downstream of and operably linked to (ii). The plasmid can also encode the RNA components of a CRISPR complex, but one or more of these may instead be encoded on a different vector. The doses herein are based on an average 70 kg individual. The frequency of administration is within the ambit of the medical or veterinary practitioner (e.g., physician, veterinarian), or scientist skilled in the art. It is also noted that mice used in experiments are typically about 20 g and from mice experiments one can scale up to a 70 kg individual. The dosage used for the compositions provided herein include dosages for repeated administration or repeat dosing. In particular embodiments, the administration is repeated within a period of several weeks, months, or years. Suitable assays can be performed to obtain an optimal dosage regime. Repeated administration can allow the use of lower dosage, which can positively affect off-target modifications.Examples of Delivery Methods and Vehicles RNA Delivery In particular embodiments, RNA based delivery is used. In these embodiments, mRNA of the CRISPR effector protein is delivered together with in vitro transcribed guide RNA. Liang et al. describes efficient genome editing using RNA based delivery (Protein Cell. 2015 May; 6(5): 363-372). RNA delivery: The CRISPR enzyme, for instance a Cpf1, and/or any of the present RNAs, for instance a guide RNA, can also be delivered in the form of RNA. Cpf1 mRNA can be generated using in vitro transcription. For example, Cpf1 mRNA can be synthesized using a PCR cassette containing the following elements: T7_promoter-kozak sequence (GCCACC)-Cpf1-3 UTR from beta globin-polyA tail (a string of 120 or more adenines). The cassette can be used for transcription by T7 polymerase. Guide RNAs can also be transcribed using in vitro transcription from a cassette containing T7_promoter-GG-guide RNA sequence. To enhance expression and reduce possible toxicity, the CRISPR enzyme-coding sequence and/or the guide RNA can be modified to include one or more modified nucleoside e.g. using pseudo-U or 5-Methyl-C. mRNA delivery methods are especially promising for liver delivery currently. Much clinical work on RNA delivery has focused on RNAi or antisense, but these systems can be adapted for delivery of RNA for implementing the present invention. References below to RNAi etc. should be read accordingly. CRISPR enzyme mRNA and guide RNA might also be delivered separately. CRISPR enzyme mRNA can be delivered prior to the guide RNA to give time for CRISPR enzyme to be expressed. CRISPR enzyme mRNA might be administered 1-12 hours (preferably around 2-6 hours) prior to the administration of guide RNA. Alternatively, CRISPR enzyme mRNA and guide RNA can be administered together. Advantageously, a second booster dose of guide RNA can be administered 1-12 hours (preferably around 2-6 hours) after the initial administration of CRISPR enzyme mRNA+guide In particular embodiments, pre-complexed guide protein are delivered as a ribonucleoprotein (RNP). RNPs have the advantage that they lead to rapid editing effects even more so than the RNA method because this process avoids the need for transcription. An important advantage is that both RNP delivery is transient, reducing off-target effects and toxicity issues. Efficient genome editing in different cell types has been observed by Kim et al. (2014, Genome Res. 24(6):1012-9), Paix et al. (2015, Genetics 204(1):47-54), Chu et al. (2016, BMC Biotechnol. 16:4), and Wang et al. (2013, Cell. 9; 153(4):910-8). In particular embodiments, the ribonucleoprotein is delivered by way of a polypeptide-based shuttle agent as described in WO2016161516. WO2016161516 describes efficient transduction of polypeptide cargos using synthetic peptides comprising an endosome leakage domain (ELD) operably linked to a cell penetrating domain (CPD), to a histidine-rich domain and a CPD. Similarly these polypeptides can be used for the delivery of CRISPR-effector based RNPs in eukaryotic cells. Indeed, RNA delivery is a useful method of in vivo delivery. It is possible to deliver Cpf1 and gRNA (and, for instance, HR repair template) into cells using liposomes or particles. Thus delivery of the CRISPR enzyme, such as a Cpf1 and/or delivery of the RNAs of the invention may be in RNA form and via microvesicles, liposomes or particles. For example, Cpf1 mRNA and gRNA can be packaged into liposomal particles delivery in vivo. Liposomal transfection reagents such as lipofectamine from Life Technologies and other reagents on the market can effectively deliver RNA molecules into the liver. Means of delivery of RNA also preferred include delivery of RNA via nanoparticles (Cho, S., Goldberg, M., Son, S., Xu, Q., Yang, F., Mei, Y., Bogatyrev, S., Langer, R. and Anderson, D., Lipid-like nanoparticles for small interfering RNA delivery to endothelial cells, Advanced Functional Materials, 19: 3112-3118, 2010) or exosomes (Schroeder, A., Levins, C., Cortez, Langer, R., and Anderson, D., Lipid-based nanotherapeutics for siRNA delivery, Journal of Internal Medicine, 267: 9-21, 2010, PMID: 20059641). Indeed, exosomes have been shown to be particularly useful in delivery siRNA, a system with some parallels to the CRISPR system. For instance, El-Andaloussi S, et al. (\"Exosome-mediated delivery of siRNA in vitro 2012 December; doi: 10.1038/nprot.2012.131. Epub 2012 Nov. 15.) describe how exosomes are promising tools for drug delivery across different biological barriers and can be harnessed for delivery of siRNA in vitro and in vivo. Their approach is to generate targeted exosomes through transfection of an expression vector, comprising an exosomal protein fused with a peptide ligand. The exosomes are then purify and characterized from transfected cell supernatant, then RNA is loaded into the exosomes. Delivery or administration according to the invention can be performed with exosomes, in particular but not limited to the brain. Vitamin E (-tocopherol) may be conjugated with CRISPR Cas and delivered to the brain along with high density lipoprotein (HDL), for example in a similar manner as was done by Uno et al. (HUMAN GENE THERAPY 22:711-719 (June 2011)) for delivering short-interfering RNA (siRNA) to the brain. Mice were infused via Osmotic minipumps (model 1007D; Alzet, Cupertino, Calif.) filled with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or free TocsiBACE or Toc-siBACE/HDL and connected with Brain Infusion Kit 3 (Alzet). A brain-infusion cannula was placed about 0.5 mm posterior to the bregma at midline for infusion into the dorsal third ventricle. Uno et al. found that as little as 3 nmol of Toc-siRNA with HDL could induce a target reduction in comparable degree by the same ICV infusion method. A similar dosage of CRISPR Cas conjugated to -tocopherol and co-administered with HDL targeted to the brain may be contemplated for humans in the present invention, for example, about 3 nmol to about 3 mol of CRISPR Cas targeted to the brain may be contemplated. Zou et al. ((HUMAN GENE THERAPY 22:465-475 (April 2011)) describes a method of lentiviral-mediated delivery of short-hairpin RNAs targeting PKC for in vivo gene silencing in the spinal cord of rats. Zou et al. administered about 10 l of a recombinant lentivirus having a titer of 1\u00d7109 transducing units (TU)/ml by an intrathecal catheter. A similar dosage of CRISPR Cas expressed in a lentiviral vector may be contemplated for humans in the present invention, for example, about 10-50 ml of CRISPR Cas in a lentivirus having a titer of 1\u00d7109 transducing units (TU)/ml may be contemplated. A similar dosage of CRISPR Cas expressed in a lentiviral vector targeted to the brain may be contemplated for humans in the present invention, for example, about 10-50 ml of CRISPR Cas targeted to the brain in a lentivirus having a titer of 1\u00d7109 transducing units (TU)/ml may be contemplated. Anderson et al. (US 20170079916) provides a modified dendrimer nanoparticle for the delivery of therapeutic, prophylactic and/or diagnostic agents to a subject, comprising: one or more zero to seven generation alkylated dendrimers; one or more amphiphilic polymers; and one or more therapeutic, prophylactic and/or diagnostic agents encapsulated therein. One alkylated dendrimer may be selected from and diagnostic agent may be selected from the group consisting of proteins, peptides, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, lipids, small molecules and combinations thereof. Anderson et aL (US 20160367686) provides a compound of Formula (I): and salts thereof, wherein each instance of R L is independently optionally substituted C6-C40 alkenyl, and a composition for the delivery of an agent to a subject or cell comprising the compound, or a salt thereof; an agent; and optionally, an excipient. The agent may be an organic molecule, inorganic molecule, nucleic acid, protein, peptide, polynucleotide, targeting agent, an isotopically labeled chemical compound, vaccine, an immunological agent, or an agent useful in bioprocessing. The composition may further comprise cholesterol, a PEGylated lipid, a phospholipid, or an apolipoprotein. Anderson et al. (US20150232883) provides a delivery particle formulations and/or systems, preferably nanoparticle delivery formulations and/or systems, comprising (a) a CRISPR-Cas system RNA polynucleotide sequence; or (b) Cas9; or (c) both a CRISPR-Cas system RNA polynucleotide sequence and Cas9; or (d) one or more vectors that contain nucleic acid molecule(s) encoding (a), (b) or (c), wherein the CRISPR-Cas system RNA polynucleotide sequence and the Cas9 do not naturally occur together. The delivery particle formulations may further comprise a surfactant, lipid or protein, wherein the surfactant may comprise a cationic lipid. Anderson et al. (US20050123596) provides examples of microparticles that are designed to release their payload when exposed to acidic conditions, wherein the microparticles comprise at least one agent to be delivered, a pH triggering agent, and a polymer, wherein the polymer is selected from the group of polymethacrylates and polyacrylates. Anderson et al (US 20020150626) provides lipid-protein-sugar particles for delivery of nucleic acids, wherein the polynucleotide is encapsulated in a lipid-protein-sugar matrix by contacting the polynucleotide with a lipid, a protein, and a sugar; and spray drying mixture of the polynucleotide, the lipid, the protein, and the sugar to make microparticles. In terms of local delivery to the brain, this can be achieved in various ways. For instance, material can be delivered intrastriatally e.g. by injection. Injection can be performed stereotactically via a craniotomy. Enhancing NHEJ or HR efficiency is also helpful for delivery. It is preferred that NHEJ efficiency is enhanced by co-expressing end-processing enzymes such as Trex2 (Dumitrache et al. Genetics. 2011 August; 188(4): 787-797). It is preferred that HR efficiency is increased by transiently inhibiting NHEJ machineries such as Ku70 and Ku86. HR efficiency can also be increased by co-expressing prokaryotic or eukaryotic homologous recombination enzymes such as RecBCD, RecA.Particles In some aspects or embodiments, a composition comprising a delivery particle formulation may be used. In some aspects or embodiments, the formulation comprises a CRISPR complex, the complex comprising a CRISPR protein and-a guide which directs sequence-specific binding of the CRISPR complex to a target sequence. In some embodiments, the delivery particle comprises a lipid-based particle, optionally a lipid nanoparticle, or cationic lipid and optionally biodegradable polymer. In some embodiments, the cationic lipid comprises 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP). In some embodiments, the hydrophilic polymer comprises ethylene glycol or polyethylene glycol. In some embodiments, the delivery particle further comprises a lipoprotein, preferably cholesterol. In some embodiments, the delivery particles are less than 500 nm in diameter, optionally less than 250 nm in diameter, optionally less than 100 nm in diameter, optionally about 35 nm to about 60 nm in diameter. Several types of particle delivery systems and/or formulations are known to be useful in a diverse spectrum of biomedical applications. In general, a particle is defined as a small object that behaves as a whole unit with respect to its transport and properties. Particles are further classified according to diameter. Coarse particles cover a range between 2,500 and 10,000 nanometers. Fine particles are sized between 100 and 2,500 nanometers. Ultrafine particles, or nanoparticles, are generally between 1 and 100 nanometers in size. The basis of the 100-nm limit is the fact that novel properties that differentiate particles from the bulk material typically develop at a critical length scale of under 100 nm. As used herein, a particle delivery system/formulation is defined as any biological delivery system/formulation which includes a particle in accordance with the present invention. A particle in accordance with the present invention is any entity having a greatest dimension (e.g. diameter) of less than 100 microns (m). In some embodiments, inventive particles have a greatest dimension of less than 10 in. In some embodiments, inventive particles have a greatest dimension of less than 2000 nanometers (nm). In some embodiments, inventive particles have a greatest dimension of less than 1000 nanometers (nm). In some embodiments, inventive particles have a greatest dimension of less than 900 nm, 800 nm, 700 nm, 600 nm, 500 300 nm, 200 nm, or 100 nm. Typically, inventive particles have a greatest dimension (e.g., diameter) of 500 nm or less. In some embodiments, inventive particles have a greatest dimension (e.g., diameter) of 250 nm or less. In some embodiments, inventive particles have a greatest dimension (e.g., diameter) of 200 nm or less. In some embodiments, inventive particles have a greatest dimension (e.g., diameter) of 150 nm or less. In some embodiments, inventive particles have a greatest dimension (e.g., diameter) of 100 nm or less. Smaller particles, e.g., having a greatest dimension of 50 nm or less are used in some embodiments of the invention. In some embodiments, inventive particles have a greatest dimension ranging between 25 nm and 200 nm. In terms of this invention, it is preferred to have one or more components of CRISPR complex, e.g., CRISPR enzyme or mRNA or guide RNA delivered using nanoparticles or lipid envelopes. Other delivery systems or vectors are may be used in conjunction with the nanoparticle aspects of the invention. In general, a \"nanoparticle\" refers to any particle having a diameter of less than 1000 nm. In certain preferred embodiments, nanoparticles of the invention have a greatest dimension (e.g., diameter) of 500 nm or less. In other preferred embodiments, nanoparticles of the invention have a greatest dimension ranging between 25 nm and 200 nm. In other preferred embodiments, nanoparticles of the invention have a greatest dimension of 100 nm or less. In other preferred embodiments, nanoparticles of the invention have a greatest dimension ranging between 35 nm and 60 nm. It will be appreciated that reference made herein to particles or nanoparticles can be interchangeable, where appropriate. It will be understood that the size of the particle will differ depending as to whether it is measured before or after loading. Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the term \"nanoparticles\" may apply only to the particles pre loading. Nanoparticles encompassed in the present invention may be provided in different forms, e.g., as solid nanoparticles (e.g., metal such as silver, gold, iron, titanium), non-metal, lipid-based solids, polymers), suspensions of nanoparticles, or combinations thereof. Metal, dielectric, and semiconductor nanoparticles may be prepared, as well as hybrid structures (e.g., core-shell nanoparticles). Nanoparticles made of semiconducting material may also be labeled quantum dots if they are small enough (typically sub 10 nm) that quantization of electronic energy levels occurs. Such nanoscale particles are used in biomedical applications as drug carriers or imaging agents and may be adapted for similar purposes in the present invention. Semi-solid and soft nanoparticles have been manufactured, and are within the scope of the present invention. A prototype nanoparticle of semi-solid nature is the liposome. Various types of liposome nanoparticles are currently used clinically as delivery systems for anticancer drugs and vaccines. Nanoparticles with one half hydrophilic and the other half hydrophobic are termed Janus particles and are particularly effective for stabilizing emulsions. They can self-assemble at water/oil interfaces and act as solid surfactants. Particle characterization (including e.g., characterizing morphology, dimension, etc.) is done using a variety of different techniques. Common techniques are electron microscopy (TEM, SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), dynamic light interferometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Characterization (dimension measurements) may be made as to native particles (i.e., preloading) or after loading of the cargo (herein cargo refers to e.g., one or more components of CRISPR-Cas system e.g., CRISPR enzyme or mRNA or guide RNA, or any combination thereof, and may include additional carriers and/or excipients) to provide particles of an optimal size for delivery for any in vitro, ex vivo and/or in vivo application of the present invention. In certain preferred embodiments, particle dimension (e.g., diameter) characterization is based on measurements using dynamic laser scattering (DLS). Mention is made of U.S. Pat.

Control Release, 2017 Jan. 31. pii: S0168-3659(17)30038-X. Nov. 15, 2016; Wang et al., PNAS, 113(11):2868-73 Mar. al., Adv. Healthc Mater., 3(9):1398-403, September 2014; and Wang et al., Agnew Chem Int Ed Engl., 53(11):2893-8, Mar. 10, 2014. US patent application 20110293703 relates to lipidoid compounds are also particularly useful in the administration of polynucleotides, which may be applied to deliver the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention. In one aspect, the aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds are combined with an agent to be delivered to a cell or a subject to form microparticles, nanoparticles, liposomes, or micelles. The agent to be delivered by the particles, liposomes, or micelles may be in the form of a gas, liquid, or solid, and the agent may be a polynucleotide, protein, peptide, or small molecule. The aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds may be combined with other aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds, polymers (synthetic or natural), surfactants, cholesterol, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, etc. to form the particles. These particles may then optionally be combined with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a pharmaceutical composition. US Patent Publication No. 20110293703 also provides methods of preparing the aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds. One or more equivalents of an amine are allowed to react with one or more equivalents of an epoxide-terminated compound under suitable conditions to form an aminoalcohol lipidoid compound of the present invention. In certain embodiments, all the amino groups of the amine are fully reacted with the epoxide-terminated compound to form tertiary amines. In other embodiments, all the amino groups of the amine are not fully reacted with the epoxide-terminated compound to form tertiary amines thereby resulting in primary or secondary amines in the aminoalcohol lipidoid compound. These primary or secondary amines are left as is or may be reacted with another electrophile such as a different epoxide-terminated compound. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, reacting an amine with less than excess of epoxide-terminated compound will result in a plurality of different aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds with various numbers of tails. Certain amines may be fully functionalized with two epoxide-derived compound tails while other molecules will not be completely functionalized with epoxide-derived compound tails. For example, a diamine or polyamine may include one, two, three, or four epoxide-derived compound tails off the various amino moieties of the molecule resulting in primary, secondary, and tertiary amines. In certain embodiments, all the amino groups are not fully functionalized. In certain embodiments, two of the same types of epoxide-terminated compounds are used. In other embodiments, two or more different epoxide-terminated compounds are used. The synthesis of the aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds is performed with or without solvent, and the synthesis may be performed at higher temperatures ranging from 30100\u00b0 C., preferably at approximately 50-90\u00b0 C. The prepared aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds may be optionally purified. For example, the mixture of aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds may be purified to yield an aminoalcohol lipidoid compound with a particular number of epoxide-derived compound tails. Or the mixture may be purified to yield a particular stereo- or regioisomer. The aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds may also be alkylated using alkyl halide (e.g., methyl iodide) or other alkylating agent, and/or they may be acylated. US Patent Publication No. 20110293703 also provides libraries of aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds prepared by the inventive methods. These aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds may be prepared and/or screened using high-throughput techniques involving liquid handlers, robots, microtiter plates, computers, etc. In certain embodiments, the aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds are screened for their ability to transfect polynucleotides or other agents (e.g., proteins, peptides, small molecules) into the cell. US Patent Publication No. 20130302401 relates to a class of poly(beta-amino alcohols) (PBAAs) has been prepared using combinatorial polymerization. The inventive PBAAs may be used in biotechnology and biomedical applications as coatings (such as coatings of films or multilayer films for medical devices or implants), additives, materials, excipients, non-biofouling agents, micropatterning agents, and cellular encapsulation agents. When used as surface coatings, these PBAAs elicited different levels of inflammation, both in vitro and in vivo, depending on their chemical structures. The large chemical diversity of this class of materials allowed us to identify polymer coatings that inhibit macrophage activation in vitro. Furthermore, these coatings reduce the recruitment of inflammatory cells, and reduce fibrosis, following the subcutaneous implantation of carboxylated polystyrene microparticles. These polymers may be used to form polyelectrolyte complex capsules for cell encapsulation. The invention may also have many other biological applications such as antimicrobial coatings, DNA or siRNA delivery, and stem cell tissue engineering. The teachings of US Patent Publication No. 20130302401 may be applied to the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention. In another embodiment, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are contemplated. An antitransthyretin small interfering RNA has been encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles and delivered to humans (see, e.g., Coelho et al., N Engl J Med 2013; 369:819-29), and such a system may be adapted and applied to the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention. Doses of about 0.01 to about 1 mg per kg of body weight administered intravenously are contemplated. Medications to reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions are contemplated, such as dexamethasone, acetampinophen, diphenhydramine or cetirizine, and ranitidine are contemplated. Multiple doses of about 0.3 mg per kilogram every 4 weeks for five doses are also contemplated. Zhu et al. (US20140348900) provides for a process for preparing liposomes, lipid discs, and other lipid nanoparticles using a multi-port manifold, wherein the lipid solution stream, containing an organic solvent, is mixed with two or more streams of aqueous solution (e.g., buffer). In some aspects, at least some of the streams of the lipid and aqueous solutions are not directly opposite of each other. Thus, the process does not require dilution of the organic solvent as an additional step. In some embodiments, one of the solutions may also contain an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). This invention provides a robust process of liposome manufacturing with different lipid formulations and different payloads. Particle size, morphology, and the manufacturing scale can be controlled by altering the port size and number of the manifold ports, and by selecting the flow rate or flow velocity of the lipid and aqueous solutions. Cullis et al. (US 20140328759) provides limit size lipid nanoparticles with a diameter from 10-100 nm, in particular comprising a lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core. Methods and apparatus for preparing such limit size lipid nanoparticles are also disclosed. Manoharan et al. (US 20140308304) provides cationic lipids of formula (I) or a salt thereof, wherein X is N or P; R is absent, hydrogen, or alkyl; with respect to R1 and R2, (i) R1 and R2 are R1 and R2, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form an optionally substituted heterocylic ring; or (iii) one of alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, a 4-10 member heterocyclic ring or heteroaryl with (a) the adjacent nitrogen atom and (b) the (R)a group adjacent to the nitrogen atom; each occurrence of R is, independently, \u2014(CR3R4)\u2014; each occurrence of R3 and R4 are, independently H, OH, alkylamino, or dialkylamino; or R3 and R4, together with the carbon atom to which they are directly attached, form a cycloalkyl group, wherein no more than three R groups in each chain attached to the atom X* are cycloalkyl; each occurrence of R.sup.10 is independently selected from PEG and polymers based on and poly(amino acid)s, wherein (i) the PEG or polymer is linear or branched, (ii) the PEG or polymer is polymerized by n subunits, (iii) n is a number-averaged degree of polymerization between 10 and 200 units, and (iv) wherein the compound of formula has at most two R10 groups; Q is H, \u2014(CR3R4)\u2014, aryl, or a cholesterol moiety; each occurrence of A1, A2, A3 and A4 is, independently, \u2014(CR5R5\u2014CR5.dbd.CR5)\u2014; each occurrence of R5 is, independently, H or alkyl; M1 and M2 are each, independently, a biodegradable or \u2014O\u2014P(O)(OH)\u2014O\u2014; each ----- attached to Z is an optional bond, such that when Z is absent, Q3 and Q4 are not directly covalently bound together; a is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6; b is 0, 1, 2, or 3; c, d, e, f, i, j, m, n, q and r are each, independently, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10; g and h are each, independently, 0, 1 or 2; k and 1 are each, independently, 0 or 1, where at least one of k and 1 is 1; and o and p are each, independently, 0, 1 or 2, wherein Q3 and Q4 are each, independently, separated from the tertiary atom marked with an asterisk (X*) by a chain of 8 or more atoms. The cationic lipid can be used with other lipid components such as cholesterol and PEG-lipids to form lipid nanoparticles with oligonucleotides, to facilitate the cellular uptake and endosomal escape, and to knockdown target mRNA both in vitro and in vivo. LNPs have been shown to be highly effective in delivering siRNAs to the liver (see, e.g., Tabernero et al., Cancer Discovery, April 2013, Vol. 3, No. 4, pages 363-470) and are therefore contemplated for delivering RNA encoding CRISPR Cas to the liver. A dosage of about four doses of 6 mg/kg of the LNP every two weeks may be contemplated. Tabernero et al. demonstrated that tumor regression was observed after the first 2 cycles of LNPs dosed at 0.7 mg/kg, and by the end of 6 cycles the patient had achieved a partial response with complete regression of the lymph node metastasis and substantial shrinkage of the liver tumors. A complete response was obtained after 40 doses in this patient, who has remained in remission and completed treatment after receiving doses over 26 months. Two patients with RCC and extrahepatic sites of disease including kidney, lung, and lymph nodes that were progressing following prior therapy with VEGF pathway inhibitors had stable disease at all sites for approximately 8 to 12 months, and a patient with PNET and liver metastases continued on the extension study for 18 months (36 doses) with stable disease. However, the charge of the LNP may be taken into consideration. As cationic lipids combined with negatively charged lipids to induce nonbilayer structures that facilitate intracellular delivery. Because charged LNPs are rapidly cleared from circulation following intravenous injection, ionizable cationic lipids with pKa values below 7 were developed (see, e.g., Rosin et al, Molecular Therapy, vol. 19, no. 12, pages 1286-2200, December 2011). Negatively charged polymers such as RNA may be loaded into LNPs at low pH values (e.g., pH 4) where the ionizable lipids display a positive charge. However, at physiological pH values, the LNPs exhibit a low surface charge compatible with longer circulation times. Four species of ionizable cationic lipids have that LNP siRNA systems containing these lipids exhibit remarkably different gene silencing properties in hepatocytes in vivo, with potencies varying according to the series DLinKC2-DMA>DLinKDMA>DLinDMA>>DLinDAP employing a Factor VII gene silencing model (see, e.g., Rosin et al, Molecular Therapy, vol. 19, no. 12, pages 1286-2200, December 2011). A dosage of 1 g/ml of LNP or CRISPR-Cas RNA in or associated with the LNP may be contemplated, especially for a formulation containing DLinKC2-DMA. Preparation of LNPs and CRISPR Cas encapsulation may be used/and or adapted from Rosin et al, Molecular Therapy, vol. 19, no. 12, pages 1286-2200, December be provided by Tekmira Pharmaceuticals (Vancouver, Canada) or synthesized. Cholesterol may be purchased from Sigma (St Louis, Mo.). The specific CRISPR Cas RNA may be encapsulated required, 0.2% SP-DiOC18 (Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada) may be incorporated to assess cellular uptake, intracellular delivery, and biodistribution. Encapsulation may be performed by dissolving lipid mixtures comprised of cationic lipid:DSPC:cholesterol:PEG-c-DOMG (40:10:40:10 molar ratio) in ethanol to a final lipid concentration of 10 mmol/l. This ethanol solution of lipid may be added drop-wise to 50 mmol/l citrate, pH 4.0 to form multilamellar vesicles to produce final concentration of 30% ethanol vol/vol. Large unilamellar vesicles may be formed following vesicles through two stacked 80 nm Nuclepore filters using the Extruder (Northern Lipids, Vancouver, Canada). Encapsulation may be achieved by adding RNA dissolved at 2 mg/ml in 50 mmol/l citrate, pH 4.0 vesicles and incubation at 31\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes with constant mixing to a final RNA/lipid weight ratio of 0.06/1 wt/wt. Removal of ethanol and neutralization of formulation buffer were performed by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 for 16 hours using Spectra/Por 2 regenerated cellulose dialysis membranes. Nanoparticle size distribution may be determined by dynamic light scattering using a NICOMP 370 particle sizer, the vesicle/intensity modes, and Gaussian fitting (Nicomp Particle Sizing, Santa Barbara, Calif.). The particle size for all three LNP systems may be 70 nm in diameter. RNA encapsulation efficiency may be determined by removal of free RNA using VivaPureD MiniH columns (Sartorius Stedim Biotech) from samples collected before and after dialysis. The encapsulated RNA may be extracted from the eluted nanoparticles and quantified at 260 nm. RNA to lipid ratio was determined by measurement of cholesterol content in vesicles using the Cholesterol E enzymatic assay from Wako Chemicals USA (Richmond, Va.). In conjunction with the herein discussion of LNPs and PEG lipids, PEGylated liposomes or LNPs are likewise suitable for delivery of a CRISPR-Cas system or components thereof. Preparation of large LNPs may be used/and or adapted from Rosin et al, Molecular Therapy, vol. 19, no. 12, pages 1286-2200, December 2011. A lipid premix solution (20.4 mg/ml total lipid concentration) may be prepared in ethanol containing DLinKC2-DMA, DSPC, and cholesterol at 50:10:38.5 molar ratios. Sodium acetate may be added to the lipid premix at a molar ratio of 0.75:1 (sodium acetate:DLinKC2-DMA). The lipids may be subsequently hydrated by combining the mixture with 1.85 volumes of citrate buffer (10 mmol/l, pH 3.0) with vigorous stirring, resulting in spontaneous liposome formation in aqueous buffer containing 35% ethanol. The liposome solution may be incubated at 37\u00b0 C. to allow for time-dependent increase in particle size. Aliquots may be removed at various times during incubation to investigate changes in liposome size by dynamic light scattering (Zetasizer Nano Z S, Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK). Once the desired particle size is achieved, an aqueous PEG lipid solution (stock=10 mg/ml PEG-DMG in 35% (vol/vol) ethanol) may be added to the liposome mixture to yield a final PEG molar concentration of 3.5% of total lipid. Upon addition of PEG-lipids, the liposomes should their size, effectively quenching further growth. RNA may then be added to the empty liposomes at an RNA to total lipid ratio of approximately 1:10 (wt:wt), followed by incubation for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. to form loaded LNPs. The mixture may be subsequently dialyzed overnight in PBS and filtered with a 0.45 m syringe filter. Preassembled recombinant CRISPR-Cpf1 complexes comprising Cpf1 and crRNA may be transfected, for example by electroporation, resulting in high mutation rates and absence of detectable off-target mutations. Hur, J. K. et al, Targeted mutagenesis in mice by electroporation of Cpf1 ribonucleoproteins, Nat Jun. 6. doi: 10.1038/nbt.3596. [Epub ahead of print] In terms of local delivery to the brain, this can be achieved in various ways. For instance, material can be delivered intrastriatally e.g. by injection. Injection can be performed stereotactically via a craniotomy. Enhancing NHEJ or HR efficiency is also helpful for delivery. It is preferred that NHEJ efficiency is enhanced by co-expressing end-processing enzymes such as Trex2 (Dumitrache et al. Genetics. 2011 August; 188(4): 787-797). It is preferred that HR efficiency is increased by transiently inhibiting NHEJ machineries such as Ku70 and Ku86. HR efficiency can also be increased by co-expressing prokaryotic or eukaryotic homologous recombination enzymes such as RecBCD, RecA. In some embodiments, sugar-based particles may be used, for example GaNAc, as described herein and with reference to WO2014118272 (incorporated herein by reference) and Nair, J K et al., 2014, Journal of the American Chemical Society 136 (49), 16958-16961) and the teaching herein, especially in respect of delivery applies to all particles unless otherwise apparent. This may be considered to be a sugar-based particle and further details on other particle delivery systems and/or formulations are provided herein. GalNAc can therefore be considered to be a particle in the sense of the other particles described herein, such that general uses and other considerations, for instance delivery of said particles, apply to GaNAc particles as well. A solution-phase conjugation strategy may for example be used to attach triantennary GalNAc clusters (mol. wt. 2000) pp 1451-1455). Similarly, poly(acrylate) polymers have been described for in vivo nucleic acid delivery (see WO2013158141 incorporated herein by reference). In further alternative embodiments, pre-mixing CRISPR nanoparticles (or protein complexes) with naturally occurring serum proteins may be used in order to improve delivery (Akinc A et al, 2010, Molecular Therapy vol. 18 no. 7, 1357-1364). Nanoclews Further, the CRISPR system may be delivered using nanoclews, for example as described in Sun W et al, Cocoon-like self-degradable DNA nanoclew for anticancer drug delivery., J Soc. 2014 Oct. 22; 136(42):14722-5. doi: 10.1021/ja5088024. Epub 2014 Oct. 13.; or in Sun W et al, Self-Assembled DNA Nanoclews for the Efficient Delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 for Genome Editing., Angew Chem Epub is by encapsulation of the Cpf1 protein or mRNA form in a lipid particle such as an LNP. In some embodiments, therefore, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are contemplated. An antitransthyretin small interfering RNA has been encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles and delivered to humans (see, e.g., Coelho et al., N Engl J Med 2013; 369:819-29), and such a system may be adapted and applied to the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention. Doses of about 0.01 to about 1 mg per kg of body weight administered intravenously are contemplated. Medications to reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions are contemplated, such as dexamethasone, acetampinophen, diphenhydramine or cetirizine, and ranitidine are contemplated. Multiple doses of about 0.3 mg per kilogram every 4 weeks for five doses are also contemplated. LNPs have been shown to be highly effective in delivering siRNAs to the liver (see, e.g., Tabernero et al., Cancer Discovery, April 2013, Vol. 3, No. 4, pages 363-470) and are therefore contemplated for delivering RNA encoding CRISPR Cas to the liver. A dosage of about four doses of 6 mg/kg of the LNP every two weeks may be contemplated. Tabernero et al. demonstrated that tumor regression was observed after the first 2 cycles of LNPs dosed at 0.7 mg/kg, and by the end of 6 cycles the patient had achieved a partial response with complete regression of the lymph node metastasis and substantial shrinkage of the liver tumors. A complete response was obtained after 40 doses in this patient, who has remained in remission and completed treatment after receiving doses over 26 months. Two patients with RCC and extrahepatic sites of disease including kidney, lung, and lymph nodes that were progressing following prior therapy with VEGF pathway inhibitors had stable disease at all sites for approximately 8 to 12 months, and a patient with PNET and liver metastases continued on the extension study for 18 months (36 doses) with stable disease. However, the charge of the LNP may be taken into consideration. As cationic lipids combined with negatively charged lipids to induce nonbilayer structures that facilitate intracellular delivery. Because charged LNPs are rapidly cleared from circulation following intravenous injection, ionizable cationic lipids with pKa values below 7 were developed (see, e.g., Rosin et al, Molecular Therapy, vol. 19, no. 12, pages 1286-2200, December 2011). Negatively charged polymers such as RNA may be loaded into LNPs at low pH values (e.g., pH 4) where the ionizable lipids display a positive charge. However, at physiological pH values, the LNPs exhibit a low surface charge compatible with longer circulation times. Four species of ionizable cationic lipids have that LNP siRNA systems containing these lipids exhibit remarkably different gene silencing properties in hepatocytes in vivo, with potencies varying according to the series DLinKC2-DMA>DLinKDMA>DLinDMA>>DLinDAP employing a Factor VII gene silencing model (see, e.g., Rosin et al, Molecular Therapy, vol. 19, no. 12, pages 1286-2200, December 2011). A dosage of 1 g/ml of LNP or CRISPR-Cas RNA in or associated with the LNP may be contemplated, especially for a formulation containing DLinKC2-DMA. Preparation of LNPs and CRISPR Cas encapsulation may be used/and or adapted from Rosin et al, Molecular Therapy, vol. 19, no. 12, pages 1286-2200, December be provided by Tekmira Pharmaceuticals (Vancouver, Canada) or synthesized. Cholesterol may be purchased from Sigma (St Louis, Mo.). The specific CRISPR Cas RNA may be encapsulated required, 0.2% SP-DiOC18 (Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada) may be incorporated to assess cellular uptake, intracellular delivery, and biodistribution. Encapsulation may be performed by dissolving lipid mixtures comprised of cationic lipid:DSPC:cholesterol:PEG-c-DOMG (40:10:40:10 molar ratio) in ethanol to a final lipid concentration of 10 mmol/l. This ethanol solution of lipid may be added drop-wise to 50 mmol/l citrate, pH 4.0 to form multilamellar vesicles to produce final concentration of 30% ethanol vol/vol. Large unilamellar vesicles may be formed following vesicles through two stacked 80 nm Nuclepore filters using the Extruder (Northern Lipids, Vancouver, Canada). Encapsulation may be achieved by adding RNA dissolved at 2 mg/ml in 50 mmol/l citrate, pH 4.0 vesicles and incubation at 31\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes with constant mixing to a final RNA/lipid weight ratio of 0.06/1 wt/wt. Removal of ethanol and neutralization of formulation buffer were performed by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 for 16 hours using Spectra/Por 2 regenerated cellulose dialysis membranes. Nanoparticle size distribution may be determined by dynamic light scattering using a NICOMP 370 particle sizer, the vesicle/intensity modes, and Gaussian fitting (Nicomp Particle Sizing, Santa Barbara, Calif.). The particle size for all three LNP systems may be 70 nm in diameter. RNA encapsulation efficiency may be determined by removal of free RNA using VivaPureD MiniH columns (Sartorius Stedim Biotech) from samples collected before and after dialysis. The encapsulated RNA may be extracted from the eluted nanoparticles and quantified at 260 nm. RNA to lipid ratio was determined by measurement of cholesterol content in vesicles using the Cholesterol E enzymatic assay from Wako Chemicals USA (Richmond, Va.). In conjunction with the herein discussion of LNPs and PEG lipids, PEGylated liposomes or LNPs are likewise suitable for delivery of a CRISPR-Cas system or components thereof. A lipid premix solution (20.4 mg/ml total lipid concentration) may be prepared in ethanol containing DLinKC2-DMA, DSPC, and cholesterol at 50:10:38.5 molar ratios. Sodium acetate may be added to the lipid premix at a molar ratio of 0.75:1 (sodium acetate:DLinKC2-DMA). The lipids may be subsequently hydrated by combining the mixture with 1.85 volumes of citrate buffer (10 mmol/l, pH 3.0) with vigorous stirring, resulting in spontaneous liposome formation in aqueous buffer containing 35% ethanol. The liposome solution may be incubated at 37\u00b0 C. to allow for time-dependent increase in particle size. Aliquots may be removed at various times during incubation to investigate changes in liposome size by dynamic light scattering (Zetasizer Nano Z S, Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK). Once the desired particle size is achieved, an aqueous PEG lipid solution (stock=10 mg/ml PEG-DMG in 35% (vol/vol) ethanol) may be added to the liposome mixture to yield a final PEG molar concentration of 3.5% of total lipid. Upon addition of PEG-lipids, the liposomes should their size, effectively quenching further growth. RNA may then be added to the empty liposomes at an RNA to total lipid ratio of approximately 1:10 (wt:wt), followed by incubation for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. to form loaded LNPs. The mixture may be subsequently dialyzed overnight in PBS and filtered with a 0.45-m syringe filter. Spherical Nucleic Acid (SNA) constructs and other nanoparticles (particularly gold nanoparticles) are also contemplated as a means to delivery CRISPR-Cas system to intended targets. Significant data show that AuraSense Therapeutics' Spherical Nucleic Acid (SNA) constructs, based upon nucleic acid-functionalized gold nanoparticles, are useful.

Self-assembling nanoparticles with RNA may be constructed with polyethyleneimine that is PEGylated with an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide ligand attached at the distal end of the polyethylene glycol (PEG). This system has been used, for example, as a means to target tumor neovasculature expressing integrins and deliver siRNA inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGF R2) expression and thereby achieve tumor angiogenesis (see, e.g., Schiffelers et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2004, Vol. 32, No. 19). Nanoplexes may be prepared by mixing equal volumes of aqueous solutions of cationic polymer and nucleic acid to give a net molar excess of ionizable nitrogen (polymer) to phosphate (nucleic acid) over the range of 2 to 6. The electrostatic interactions between cationic polymers and nucleic acid resulted in the formation of polyplexes with average particle size distribution of about 100 nm, hence referred to here as nanoplexes. A dosage of about 100 to 200 mg of CRISPR Cas is envisioned for delivery in the self-assembling nanoparticles of Schiffelers et al. The nanoplexes of Bartlett et al. (PNAS, Sep. 25, 2007, vol. 104, no. 39) may also be applied to the present invention. The nanoplexes of Bartlett et al. are prepared by mixing equal volumes of aqueous solutions of cationic polymer and nucleic acid to give a net molar excess of ionizable nitrogen (polymer) to phosphate (nucleic acid) over the range of 2 to 6. The electrostatic interactions between cationic polymers and nucleic acid resulted in the formation of polyplexes with average particle size distribution of about 100 nm, hence referred to here as nanoplexes. The DOTA-siRNA of Bartlett et al. was synthesized as follows: 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid mono(N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) (DOTA-NHSester) was ordered from Macrocyclics (Dallas, Tex.). The amine modified RNA sense strand with a 100-fold molar excess of DOTA-NHS-ester in carbonate buffer (pH 9) was added to a microcentrifuge tube. The contents were reacted by stirring for 4 h at room temperature. The DOTA-RNAsense conjugate was ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in water, antisense yield DOTA-siRNA. All liquids were pretreated with Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.) to remove trace metal contaminants. Tf-targeted and nontargeted siRNA nanoparticles may be formed by using cyclodextrin-containing polycations. Typically, nanoparticles were formed in water at a charge ratio of 3 (+/) and an siRNA concentration of 0.5 g/liter. One percent of the adamantane-PEG molecules on the surface of the targeted nanoparticles were modified with Tf (adamantane-PEG-Tf). The nanoparticles were suspended in a 5% (wt/vol) glucose carrier solution for injection. Davis et al. (Nature, Vol464, 15 Apr. 2010) conducts a RNA clinical trial that uses a targeted nanoparticle-delivery system (clinical trial registration number NCT00689065). Patients with solid cancers refractory to standard-of-care therapies are administered doses of targeted nanoparticles on days 1, 3, 8 and 10 of a 21-day cycle by a 30-min intravenous infusion. The nanoparticles consist of a synthetic delivery system containing: (1) a linear, cyclodextrin-based polymer (CDP), (2) a human transferrin protein (TF) targeting ligand displayed on the exterior of the nanoparticle to engage TF receptors (TFR) on the surface of the cancer cells, (3) a hydrophilic polymer (polyethylene glycol (PEG) used to promote nanoparticle stability in biological fluids), and (4) siRNA designed to reduce the expression of the RRM2 (sequence used in the clinic was previously denoted siR2B+5). The TFR has long been known to be upregulated in malignant cells, and RRM2 is an established anti-cancer target. These nanoparticles (clinical version denoted as CALAA-01) have been shown to be well tolerated in multi-dosing studies in non-human primates. Although a single patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia has been administered siRNA by liposomal delivery, Davis et al.'s clinical trial is the initial human trial to systemically deliver siRNA with a targeted delivery system and to treat patients with solid cancer. To ascertain whether the targeted delivery system can provide effective delivery of functional siRNA to human tumors, Davis et al. investigated biopsies from three patients from three different dosing cohorts; patients A, B and C, all of whom had metastatic melanoma and received CALAA-01 doses of 18, 24 and 30 mg m-2 siRNA, respectively. Similar doses may also be contemplated for the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention. The delivery of the invention may be achieved with nanoparticles containing a linear, cyclodextrin-based polymer (CDP), a human transferrin protein (TF) targeting ligand displayed on the exterior of the nanoparticle to engage TF receptors (TFR) on the surface of the cancer cells and/or a hydrophilic polymer (for example, polyethylene glycol (PEG) used to promote nanoparticle stability in biological fluids).

To reduce immunogenicity, Alvarez-Erviti et al. (2011, Nat Biotechnol 29: 341) used self-derived dendritic cells for exosome production. Targeting to the brain was achieved by engineering the dendritic cells to express Lamp2b, an exosomal membrane protein, fused to the neuron-specific RVG peptide. Purified exosomes were specifically to neurons, microglia, oligodendrocytes in the brain, resulting in a specific gene knockdown. Pre-exposure to RVG exosomes did not attenuate knockdown, and non-specific uptake in other tissues was not observed. The therapeutic potential of exosome-mediated siRNA delivery was demonstrated by the strong mRNA (60%) and protein (62%) knockdown of BACE1, a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease. To obtain a pool of immunologically inert exosomes, Alvarez-Erviti et al. harvested bone marrow from inbred C57BL/6 mice with a homogenous major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype. As immature dendritic cells produce large quantities of exosomes devoid of T-cell activators such as MHC-II and CD86, Alvarez-Erviti et al. selected for dendritic cells with granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for 7 d. Exosomes were purified from the culture supernatant the following day using well-established ultracentrifugation protocols. The exosomes produced were physically homogenous, with a size distribution peaking at 80 nm in diameter as determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and electron microscopy. Alvarez-Erviti et al. obtained 6-12 g of exosomes (measured based on protein concentration) per 106 cells. Next, Alvarez-Erviti et al. investigated the possibility of loading modified exosomes with exogenous cargoes using electroporation protocols adapted for nanoscale applications. As electroporation for membrane particles at the nanometer scale is not well-characterized, nonspecific Cy5-labeled RNA was used for the empirical optimization of the electroporation protocol. The amount of encapsulated RNA was assayed after ultracentrifugation and lysis of exosomes. Electroporation at 400 V and 125 F resulted in the greatest retention of RNA and was used for all subsequent experiments. Alvarez-Erviti et al. administered 150 g of each BACE1 siRNA encapsulated in 150 g of RVG exosomes to normal C57BL/6 mice and compared the knockdown efficiency to four controls: untreated mice, mice injected with RVG exosomes only, mice injected with electrostatically binds to the siRNA. Cortical tissue samples were analyzed 3 d after administration and a significant protein knockdown (45%, P<0.05, versus 62%, P<0.01) in both siRNA-RVG-9R-treated and siRNARVG exosome-treated mice was observed, resulting from a significant decrease in BACE1 mRNA levels (66% Applicants demonstrated significant decrease (55%, P<0.05) in the total [beta]-amyloid 1-42 levels, a main component of the amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's pathology, in the RVG-exosome-treated animals. The decrease observed was greater than the -amyloid 1-40 decrease demonstrated in normal mice after intraventricular injection of BACE1 inhibitors. Alvarez-Erviti et al. carried out 5-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) on BACE1 cleavage product, which provided evidence of RNAi-mediated knockdown by the siRNA. Finally, Alvarez-Erviti et al. investigated whether RNA-RVG exosomes induced immune responses vivo by and IFN- exosome treatment, in all cytokines were registered similar to siRNA-transfection reagent treatment in contrast to siRNA-RVG-9R, which potently stimulated IL-6 secretion, confirming the immunologically inert profile of the exosome treatment. Given that exosomes encapsulate only 20% of siRNA, delivery with RVG-exosome appears to be more efficient than RVG-9R delivery as comparable mRNA knockdown and greater protein knockdown was achieved with fivefold less siRNA without the corresponding level of immune stimulation. This experiment demonstrated the therapeutic potential of RVG-exosome technology, which is potentially suited for long-term silencing of genes related to neurodegenerative diseases. The exosome delivery system of Alvarez-Erviti et al. may be applied to deliver the CRISPR-Cas system of the present invention to therapeutic targets, especially neurodegenerative diseases. A dosage of about 100 to 1000 mg of CRISPR Cas encapsulated in about 100 to 1000 mg of RVG exosomes may be contemplated for the present invention. El-Andaloussi et al. (Nature Protocols 7, 2112-2126(2012)) discloses how exosomes derived from cultured cells can be harnessed for delivery of RNA in vitro and in vivo. This protocol first describes the generation of targeted exosomes through transfection of an expression vector, comprising an exosomal protein fused with a peptide ligand. Next, El-Andaloussi et al. explain how to purify and characterize exosomes from transfected cell supernatant. Next, El-Andaloussi et al. detail crucial steps for loading RNA into exosomes. Finally, El-Andaloussi et al. outline how to use exosomes to efficiently deliver RNA in vitro and in vivo in mouse brain. Examples of anticipated results in which exosome-mediated RNA delivery is evaluated by functional assays and imaging are also provided. The entire protocol takes 3 weeks. Delivery or administration according to the invention may be performed using exosomes produced from self-derived dendritic cells. From the herein teachings, this can be employed in the practice of the invention. In another embodiment, the plasma exosomes of Wahlgren et al. (Nucleic Acids Research, 2012, Vol. 40, No. 17 e130) are contemplated. Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles (30-90 nm in size) produced by many cell types, including dendritic cells (DC), B cells, T cells, mast cells, epithelial cells and tumor cells. These vesicles are formed by inward budding of late endosomes and are then released to the extracellular environment upon fusion with the plasma membrane. Because exosomes naturally carry RNA between cells, this property may be useful in gene therapy, and from this disclosure can be employed in the practice of the instant invention. Exosomes from plasma can be prepared by centrifugation of buffy coat at 900 g for 20 min to isolate the plasma followed by harvesting cell supernatants, centrifuging at 300 g for 10 min to eliminate cells and at 16 500 g for 30 min followed by filtration through a 0.22 mm filter. Exosomes are pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 120 000 g for 70 min. Chemical transfection of siRNA into exosomes is carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions in RNAi Human/Mouse Starter Kit (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany). siRNA is added to 100 ml PBS at a final concentration of 2 mmol/ml. After adding HiPerFect transfection reagent, the mixture is incubated for 10 min at RT. In order to remove the excess of micelles, the exosomes are re-isolated using aldehyde/sulfate latex beads. The chemical transfection of CRISPR Cas into exosomes may be conducted similarly to siRNA. The exosomes may be co-cultured with monocytes and lymphocytes isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors. Therefore, it may be contemplated that exosomes containing CRISPR Cas may be introduced to monocytes and lymphocytes of and autologously reintroduced into a human. Accordingly, delivery or administration according to the invention may be performed using plasma exosomes.Liposomes The lipid, lipid particle, or lipid bylayer or lipid entity of the invention can be prepared by methods well known in the art.

In one embodiment, the lipid compound is preferably a bio-reducible material, e.g., a bio-reducible polymer and a bio-reducible lipid-like compound. In embodiment, the lipid compound comprises a hydrophilic head, and a hydrophobic tail, and optionally a linker. In one embodiment, the hydrophilic head contains one or more hydrophilic functional groups, e.g., hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, phosphate, amide, ester, ether, carbamate, carbonate, carbamide and phosphodiester. These groups can form hydrogen bonds and are optionally positively or negatively charged, in particular at physiological conditions such as physiological pH. In one embodiment, the hydrophobic tail is a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, acyclic or cyclic, aromatic or nonaromatic hydrocarbon moiety, wherein the saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, acyclic or cyclic, aromatic or nonaromatic hydrocarbon moiety optionally contains a disulfide bond and/or 8-24 carbon atoms. One or more of the carbon atoms can be replaced with a heteroatom, such as N, O, P, B, S, Si, Sb, Al, Sn, As, Se, and Ge. The lipid or lipid-like compounds containing disulfide bond can be bioreducible. In one embodiment, the linker of the lipid or lipid-like compound links the hydrophilic head and the hydrophobic tail. The linker can be any chemical group that is hydrophilic or hydrophobic, polar or non-polar, e.g., O, S, Si, amino, alkylene, ester, amide, carbamate, carbamide, carbonate phosphate, phosphite, sulfate, sulfite, and thiosulfate. The lipid or lipid-like compounds described above include the compounds themselves, as well as their salts and solvates, if applicable. A salt, for example, can be formed between an anion and a positively charged group (e.g., amino) on a lipid-like compound. Suitable anions salt can also be formed between a cation and a negatively charged group (e.g., carboxylate) on a lipid-like compound. Suitable cations include sodium ion, potassium ion, magnesium ion, calcium ion, and an ammonium cation such as tetramethylammonium ion. The lipid-like compounds also include those salts containing quaternary nitrogen atoms. A solvate refers to a complex formed between a lipid-like compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable solvents include water, ethanol, isopropanol, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine. Delivery or administration according to the invention can be performed with liposomes. Liposomes are spherical vesicle structures composed of a uni- or multilamellar lipid bilayer surrounding internal aqueous relatively impermeable outer lipophilic phospholipid bilayer. Liposomes have gained considerable attention as drug delivery carriers because they are biocompatible, nontoxic, can deliver both hydrophilic and lipophilic drug molecules, protect their cargo from degradation by plasma enzymes, and transport their load across biological membranes and the blood brain barrier (BBB) (see, e.g., Spuch and Navarro, Journal of Drug Delivery, vol. 2011, Article ID 469679, 12 pages, 2011. doi:10.1155/2011/469679 for review). Liposomes can be made from several different types of lipids; however, phospholipids are commonly used to generate liposomes as drug carriers. Although liposome formation is spontaneous when a lipid film is mixed with an aqueous solution, it can also be expedited by applying force in the form of shaking by using a homogenizer, sonicator, or an extrusion apparatus (see, e.g., Spuch and Navarro, Journal of Drug Delivery, vol. 2011, Article ID 469679, 12 pages, 2011. doi:10.1155/2011/469679 for review). Several other additives may be added to liposomes in order to modify their structure and properties. For instance, either cholesterol or sphingomyelin may be added to the liposomal mixture in order to help stabilize the liposomal structure and to prevent the leakage of the liposomal inner cargo. Further, liposomes are prepared from hydrogenated egg phosphatidylcholine or egg phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and dicetyl phosphate, and their mean vesicle sizes were adjusted to about 50 and 100 nm. (see, e.g., Spuch and Navarro, Journal of Drug Delivery, vol. 2011, Article ID 469679, 12 pages, 2011. doi:10.1155/2011/469679 for review). A liposome formulation may be mainly comprised of natural phospholipids and lipids such as 1,2-distearoryl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidyl choline (DSPC), sphingomyelin, egg phosphatidylcholines and monosialoganglioside. Since this formulation is made up of phospholipids only, liposomal formulations have encountered many challenges, one of the ones being the instability in plasma. Several attempts to overcome these challenges have been made, specifically in the manipulation of the lipid membrane. One of these attempts focused on the manipulation of cholesterol. Addition of cholesterol to conventional formulations reduces rapid release of the encapsulated bioactive compound into the plasma or 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) increases the stability (see, e.g., Spuch and Navarro, Journal of Drug Delivery, vol. 2011, Article ID 469679, 12 pages, 2011. doi:10.1155/2011/469679 for review). In a particularly advantageous embodiment, Trojan Horse liposomes (also known as Molecular Trojan Horses) are desirable and protocols may be found at cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2010/4/pdb.prot5407.long. These particles allow delivery of a transgene to the entire brain after an intravascular injection. Without being bound by limitation, it is believed that neutral lipid particles with specific antibodies conjugated to surface allow crossing of the blood brain barrier via endocytosis. Applicant postulates utilizing Trojan Horse Liposomes to deliver the CRISPR family of nucleases to the brain via an intravascular injection, which would allow whole brain transgenic animals without the need for embryonic manipulation. About 1-5 g of DNA or RNA may be contemplated for in vivo administration in liposomes. In another embodiment, the CRISPR Cas system or components thereof may be administered in liposomes, such as a stable nucleic-acid-lipid particle (SNALP) (see, e.g., Morrissey et al., Nature Biotechnology, Vol. 23, No. 8, August 2005). Daily intravenous injections of about 1, 3 or 5 mg/kg/day of a specific CRISPR Cas targeted in a SNALP are contemplated. The daily treatment may be over about three days and then weekly for about five weeks. In another embodiment, a specific CRISPR Cas encapsulated SNALP) administered by intravenous injection to at doses of about 1 or 2.5 mg/kg are also contemplated (see, e.g., Zimmerman et al., Nature Letters, Vol. 441, 4 May 2006). The SNALP formulation may contain in a 2:40:10:48 molar percent ratio (see, e.g., Zimmerman et al., Nature Letters, Vol. 441, 4 May 2006). In another embodiment, stable nucleic-acid-lipid particles (SNALPs) have proven to be effective delivery molecules to highly vascularized HepG2-derived liver tumors but not in poorly vascularized HCT-116 derived liver tumors (see, e.g., Li, Gene Therapy (2012) 19, 775-780). The SNALP liposomes may be prepared by formulating D-Lin-DMA and PEG-C-DMA distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), Cholesterol and siRNA using a 25:1 lipid/siRNA ratio and a 48/40/10/2 molar ratio of Cholesterol/D-Lin-DMA/DSPC/PEG-C-DMA. The resulted SNALP liposomes are about 80-100 nm in size. In yet another embodiment, a SNALP may comprise synthetic cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Mo., USA), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, USA), 3-N-[(w-methoxy et al., 1896-905). A dosage of about 2 mg/kg total CRISPR Cas per dose administered as, for example, a bolus intravenous infusion may be contemplated. In yet another embodiment, a SNALP may comprise synthetic cholesterol e.g., Judge, J. Clin. Invest. 119:661-673 (2009)). Formulations used for in vivo studies may comprise a final lipid/RNA mass ratio of about 9:1. The safety profile of RNAi nanomedicines has been reviewed by Barros and Gollob of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (see, e.g., Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 64 (2012) 1730-1737). The stable nucleic acid lipid particle (SNALP) is comprised of four different lipids\u2014an ionizable lipid (DLinDMA) that is cationic at low pH, a neutral helper lipid, cholesterol, and a diffusible polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid. The particle is approximately 80 nm in diameter and is charge-neutral at physiologic pH. During formulation, the ionizable lipid serves to condense lipid with the anionic RNA during particle formation. When positively charged under increasingly acidic endosomal conditions, the ionizable lipid also mediates the fusion of SNALP with the endosomal membrane enabling release of RNA into the cytoplasm. The PEG-lipid stabilizes the particle and reduces aggregation during formulation, and subsequently provides a neutral hydrophilic exterior that improves pharmacokinetic properties. To date, two clinical programs have been initiated using SNALP formulations with RNA. Tekmira Pharmaceuticals recently completed a phase I single-dose study of SNALP-ApoB in adult volunteers with elevated LDL cholesterol. ApoB is predominantly expressed in the liver and jejunum and is essential for the assembly and secretion of VLDL and LDL. Seventeen subjects received a single dose of SNALP-ApoB (dose escalation across 7 dose levels). There was no evidence of liver toxicity (anticipated as the potential dose-limiting toxicity based on preclinical studies). One (of two) subjects at the highest dose experienced flu-like symptoms consistent with immune system stimulation, and the decision was made to conclude the trial. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals has similarly advanced ALN-TTR01, which employs the SNALP technology described above and targets hepatocyte production of both mutant and wild-type TTR to treat TTR amyloidosis autosomal dominant mutations in TTR; and senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA) cause by wildtype TTR. A placebo-controlled, single dose-escalation phase I trial of ALN-TTRO1 was recently completed in patients with ATTR. ALN-TTRO1 was administered as a 15-minute IV infusion to 31 patients (23 with study drug and 8 with placebo) within a dose range of 0.01 to 1.0 mg/kg (based on siRNA). Treatment was well tolerated with no significant increases in liver function tests. Infusion-related reactions were noted in 3 of 23 patients at >0.4 mg/kg; all responded to slowing of the infusion rate and all continued on study. Minimal and transient elevations of serum cytokines IL-6, IP-10 and IL-1ra were noted in two patients at the highest dose of 1 mg/kg (as anticipated from preclinical and NHP studies). Lowering of serum TTR, the expected pharmacodynamics effect of ALN-TTR01, was observed at 1 mg/kg. In yet another embodiment, a SNALP may be made by solubilizing a cationic lipid, DSPC, cholesterol and PEG-lipid e.g., in ethanol, e.g., at a molar ratio of 40:10:40:10, respectively (see, Semple et al., Nature Niotechnology, Volume 28 Number 2 Feb. 2010, pp. 172-177). The lipid mixture was added to an aqueous buffer (50 mM citrate, pH 4) with mixing to a final ethanol and lipid concentration of 30% (vol/vol) and 6.1 mg/ml, respectively, and allowed to equilibrate at 22\u00b0 C. for 2 min before extrusion. The hydrated lipids were extruded through two stacked 80 nm pore-sized filters (Nuclepore) at 22\u00b0 C. using a Lipids) until a vesicle diameter of 70-90 nm, as determined by dynamic light scattering analysis, was obtained. This generally required 1-3 passes. The siRNA (solubilized in a 50 mM citrate, pH 4 aqueous solution containing 30% ethanol) was added to the pre-equilibrated (35\u00b0 C.) vesicles at a rate of 5 ml/min with mixing. After a final target siRNA/lipid ratio of 0.06 (wt/wt) was reached, the mixture was incubated for a further 30 min at 35\u00b0 C. to allow vesicle reorganization and encapsulation of the siRNA. The ethanol was then removed and the external buffer replaced with PBS (155 mM NaCl, 3 mM Na2HPO4, 1 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.5) by either dialysis or tangential flow diafiltration. siRNA were encapsulated in SNALP using a controlled step-wise dilution method process. The lipid of (cationic lipid), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC; Avanti Polar Lipids), synthetic cholesterol (Sigma) and PEG-C-DMA used at a molar ratio of 57.1:7.1:34.3:1.4. Upon formation of the loaded particles, SNALP were dialyzed against PBS and filter sterilized through a 0.2 m filter before use. Mean particle sizes were 75-85 nm and 90-95% of the siRNA was encapsulated within the lipid particles. The final siRNA/lipid ratio in formulations used for in vivo testing was 0.15 (wt/wt). LNP-siRNA systems containing Factor VII siRNA were diluted to the appropriate concentrations in sterile PBS immediately before use and the formulations were administered intravenously through the lateral tail vein in a total volume of 10 ml/kg. This method and these delivery systems may be extrapolated to the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention.Other Lipids Other cationic lipids, such as amino lipid 2,2-dilinoleyl-4-dimethylaminoethyl-[1,3]-dioxolane (DLin-KC2-DMA) may be utilized to encapsulate CRISPR Cas or components thereof or nucleic acid molecule(s) coding therefor e.g., similar to SiRNA (see, e.g., Jayaraman, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2012, 51, 8529-8533), and hence may be employed in the practice of the invention. A preformed vesicle with the following lipid composition may be contemplated: distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), cholesterol and ratio 40/10/40/10, respectively, and a FVII siRNA/total lipid ratio of approximately 0.05 (w/w). To ensure a narrow particle size distribution in the range of 70-90 nm and a low polydispersity index of 0.11+0.04 (n=56), the particles may be extruded up to three times through 80 nm membranes prior to adding the guide RNA. Particles containing the highly potent amino lipid 16 may be used, in which the molar ratio of the four lipid components 16, DSPC, cholesterol and PEG-lipid (50/10/38.5/1.5) which may be further optimized to enhance in vivo activity. Michael S D Kormann et al. (\"Expression of therapeutic proteins after delivery of chemically modified mRNA in mice: Nature Biotechnology, Volume: 29, Pages: 154-157 (2011)) describes the use of lipid envelopes to deliver RNA. Use of lipid envelopes is also preferred in the present invention. In another embodiment, lipids may be formulated with the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention or component(s) thereof or nucleic acid molecule(s) coding therefor to form lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Lipids include, limited and colipids disteroylphosphatidyl choline, cholesterol, and PEG-DMG may be formulated with CRISPR Cas instead of siRNA (see, e.g., Novobrantseva, Molecular Therapy-Nucleic Acids (2012) 1, e4; doi:10.1038/mtna.2011.3) using a spontaneous vesicle formation procedure. The component molar ratio may be about 50/10/38.5/1.5 (DLin-KC2-DMA or C12-200/disteroylphosphatidyl choline/cholesterol/PEG-DMG). The final lipid:siRNA weight ratio may be 12:1 and 9:1 in the case of DLin-KC2-DMA and C12-200 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), respectively. The formulations may have mean particle diameters of 80 nm with >90% entrapment efficiency. A 3 mg/kg dose may be contemplated. Tekmira has a portfolio of approximately 95 patent families, in the U.S. and abroad, that are directed to various aspects of LNPs and LNP formulations (see, e.g., 1519714; 1781593 and 1664316), all of which may be used and/or adapted to the present invention. The CRISPR Cas system or components thereof or nucleic acid molecule(s) coding therefor may be delivered encapsulated in PLGA Microspheres such as that further described in US published applications 20130252281 and 20130245107 and 20130244279 (assigned to Moderna Therapeutics) which relate to aspects of formulation of compositions comprising modified nucleic acid molecules which may encode a protein, a protein precursor, or a partially or fully processed form of the protein or a protein precursor. The formulation may have a molar ratio 50:10:38.5:1.5-3.0 (cationic lipid:fusogenic lipid:cholesterol:PEG lipid). The PEG lipid may be selected from, but is not limited to PEG-c-DOMG, PEG-DMG. The fusogenic lipid may be DSPC. See also, Schrum et al., Delivery and Formulation of Engineered Nucleic Acids, US published application 20120251618. Nanomerics' technology addresses bioavailability challenges for a broad range of therapeutics, including low molecular weight hydrophobic drugs, peptides, and nucleic acid based therapeutics (plasmid, siRNA, miRNA). Specific administration routes for which the technology has demonstrated clear advantages include the oral route, transport across the blood-brain-barrier, delivery to solid tumours, as well as to the eye. See, e.g., Mazza et al., 2013, ACS Nano. 2013 Feb. 26; 7(2):1016-26; Uchegbu and Siew, 2013, J Pharm Sci. 102(2):305-10 and Lalatsa et al., 2012, J Control Release. 2012 Jul. 20; 161(2):523-36. US Patent Publication No. 20050019923 describes cationic dendrimers for delivering bioactive molecules, such as polynucleotide molecules, peptides and polypeptides and/or pharmaceutical agents, to a mammalian body. The dendrimers are suitable for targeting the delivery of the bioactive molecules to, for example, the liver, spleen, lung, kidney or heart (or even the brain). Dendrimers are synthetic 3-dimensional macromolecules that are prepared in a step-wise fashion from simple branched monomer units, the nature and functionality of which can be easily controlled and varied. Dendrimers are synthesised from the repeated addition of building blocks to a multifunctional core (divergent approach to synthesis), or towards a multifunctional core (convergent approach to synthesis) and each addition of a 3-dimensional shell of building blocks leads to the formation of a higher generation of the dendrimers. Polypropylenimine dendrimers start from a diaminobutane core to which is added twice the number of amino groups by a double Michael addition of acrylonitrile to the primary amines followed by the hydrogenation of the nitriles. This results in a doubling of the amino groups. Polypropylenimine dendrimers contain 100% protonable nitrogens and up to 64 terminal amino groups (generation 5, DAB 64). Protonable groups are usually amine groups which are able to accept protons at neutral pH. The use of dendrimers as gene delivery agents has largely focused on the use of the polyamidoamine. and phosphorous containing compounds with a mixture of amine/amide or N\u2014P(O2)S as the conjugating units respectively with no work being reported on the use of the lower generation polypropylenimine dendrimers for gene delivery. Polypropylenimine dendrimers have also been studied as pH sensitive controlled release systems for drug delivery and for their encapsulation of guest molecules when chemically modified by peripheral amino acid groups. The cytotoxicity and interaction of polypropylenimine dendrimers with DNA as well as the transfection efficacy of DAB 64 has also been studied. US Patent Publication No. 20050019923 is based upon the observation that, contrary to earlier reports, cationic dendrimers, such as polypropylenimine dendrimers, display suitable properties, such as specific targeting and low toxicity, for use in the targeted delivery of bioactive molecules, such as genetic material. In addition, derivatives of the cationic dendrimer also display suitable properties for the targeted delivery of bioactive molecules. See also, Bioactive Polymers, US published polymers, are shown to possess anti-proliferative activity, and may therefore be useful for treatment of disorders characterised by undesirable cellular proliferation such as neoplasms and tumours, inflammatory disorders (including autoimmune disorders), psoriasis and atherosclerosis. The polymers may be used alone as active agents, or as delivery vehicles for other therapeutic agents, such as drug molecules or nucleic acids for gene therapy. In such cases, the polymers' own intrinsic anti-tumour activity may complement the activity of the agent to be delivered.\" The disclosures of these patent publications may be employed in conjunction with herein teachings for delivery of CRISPR Cas system(s) or component(s) thereof or nucleic acid molecule(s) coding therefor.Supercharged Proteins Supercharged proteins are a class of engineered or naturally occurring proteins with unusually high positive or negative net theoretical charge and may be employed in delivery of CRISPR Cas system(s) or component(s) thereof or nucleic acid molecule(s) coding therefor. Both supernegatively and superpositively charged proteins exhibit a remarkable ability to withstand thermally or chemically induced aggregation. Superpositively charged proteins are also able to penetrate mammalian cells. Associating cargo with these proteins, such as plasmid DNA, RNA, or other proteins, can enable the functional delivery of these macromolecules into mammalian cells both in vitro and in vivo. David Liu's lab reported the creation and characterization of supercharged proteins in 2007 (Lawrence et al., 2007, Journal of the American Chemical Society 129, 10110-10112). The nonviral delivery of RNA and plasmid DNA into mammalian cells are valuable both for research and therapeutic applications (Akinc et al., 2010, Nat. Biotech. 26, 561-569). Purified+36 GFP protein (or other superpositively charged protein) is mixed with RNAs in the appropriate serum-free media and allowed to complex prior addition to cells. Inclusion of serum at this stage inhibits formation of the supercharged protein-RNA complexes and reduces the effectiveness of the treatment. The following protocol has been found to be effective for a variety of cell lines (McNaughton et al., 2009, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 106, 6111-6116) (However, pilot experiments varying the dose of protein and RNA should be performed to optimize the procedure for specific cell lines): (1) One day before treatment, plate 1\u00d7105 cells per well in a 48-well plate. (2) On the day of treatment, dilute purified+36 GFP protein in serumfree media to a final concentration 200 nM. Add RNA to a final concentration of 50 nM. Vortex to mix and incubate at room temperature for 10 min. (3) During incubation, aspirate media from cells and wash once with PBS. (4) Following incubation of +36 GFP and RNA, add the protein-RNA complexes to cells. (5) Incubate cells with complexes at 37\u00b0 C. for 4h. (6) Following incubation, aspirate the media and wash three times with 20 U/mL heparin PBS. Incubate cells with serum-containing media for a further 48h or longer depending upon the assay for activity. (7) Analyze cells by immunoblot, qPCR, phenotypic assay, or other appropriate method. David Liu's lab has further found +36 GFP to be an effective plasmid delivery reagent in a range of cells. As plasmid DNA is a larger cargo than siRNA, proportionately more +36 GFP protein may be needed to effectively complex plasmids. For effective plasmid delivery Applicants have developed a variant of +36 GFP bearing a C-terminal HA2 peptide tag, a known endosome-disrupting peptide derived from the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein. The following protocol has been effective in a variety of cells, but as above it is advised that plasmid DNA and supercharged protein doses be optimized for specific cell lines and delivery applications: (1) One day before treatment, plate 1\u00d710 per well in a 48-well plate. (2) On the d ay of treatment, dilute purified 36 GFP protein in serumfree media to a final concentration 2 mM. Add 1 mg of plasmid DNA. Vortex to mix and incubate at room temperature for 10 min. (3) During incubation, aspirate media from cells and wash once with PBS. (4) Following incubation of 36 GFP and plasmid DNA, gently add the protein-DNA complexes to cells. (5) Incubate cells with complexes at 37 C for 4h. (6) Following incubation, aspirate the media and wash with PBS. Incubate cells in serum-containing media and incubate for a further 24-48h. (7) Analyze plasmid delivery (e.g., by plasmid-driven gene expression) as appropriate. See also, e.g., McNaughton et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 106, 6111-6116 ACS Chemical Biology 5, 747-752 (2010); Cronican et al., Chemistry & Biology 18, 833-838 Thompson et al., Methods in Enzymology 503, 293-319 (2012); Thompson, D. B., et al., Chemistry & Biology 19 (7), 831-843 (2012). The methods of the super charged proteins may be used and/or adapted for delivery of the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention. These systems of Dr. Lui and documents herein in conjunction with herein teaching can be employed in the delivery of CRISPR Cas system(s) or component(s) thereof or nucleic acid molecule(s) coding therefor.Cell Penetrating Peptides (CPPs) In yet another embodiment, cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are contemplated for the delivery of the CRISPR Cas system. CPPs are short peptides that facilitate cellular uptake of various molecular cargo (from nanosize particles to small chemical molecules and large fragments of DNA). The term \"cargo\" as used herein includes but is not limited to the group consisting of therapeutic agents, diagnostic probes, peptides, nucleic acids, antisense oligonucleotides, plasmids, proteins, particles, including nanoparticles, liposomes, chromophores, small molecules and radioactive materials. In aspects of the invention, the cargo may also comprise any component of the CRISPR Cas system or the entire functional CRISPR Cas system. Aspects of the present invention further provide methods for delivering a desired cargo into a subject comprising: (a) preparing a complex comprising the cell penetrating peptide of the present invention and a desired cargo, and the complex to a subject. The cargo is associated with the peptides either through chemical linkage via covalent bonds or through non-covalent interactions. The function of the CPPs are to deliver the cargo into cells, a process that commonly occurs through endocytosis with the cargo delivered to the endosomes of living mammalian cells. Cell-penetrating peptides are of different sizes, amino acid sequences, and charges but all CPPs have one distinct characteristic, which is the ability to translocate the plasma membrane and facilitate the delivery of various molecular cargoes to the cytoplasm or an organelle. CPP translocation may be classified into three main entry mechanisms: direct penetration in the membrane, endocytosis-mediated entry, and translocation through the formation of a transitory structure. CPPs have found numerous applications in medicine as drug delivery agents in the treatment of different diseases including cancer and virus inhibitors, as well as contrast agents for cell labeling. Examples of the latter include acting as a carrier for GFP, MRI contrast agents, or quantum dots. CPPs hold great potential as in vitro and in vivo delivery vectors for use in research and medicine. CPPs typically have an amino acid composition that either contains a high relative abundance of positively charged amino acids such as lysine or arginine or has sequences that contain an alternating pattern of polar/charged amino acids and non-polar, hydrophobic amino acids. These two types of structures are referred to as polycationic or amphipathic, respectively. A third class of CPPs are the hydrophobic peptides, containing only apolar residues, with low net charge or have hydrophobic amino acid groups that are crucial for cellular uptake. One of the initial CPPs discovered was the trans-activating transcriptional activator (Tat) from Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) which was found to be efficiently taken up from the surrounding media by numerous cell types in culture. Since then, the number of known CPPs has expanded considerably and small molecule synthetic analogues with more effective protein transduction properties have been generated. CPPs include but are not limited to Penetratin, Tat (48-60), Transportan, and (R-AhX-R4) (Ahx=aminohexanoyl). U.S. Pat. No. 8,372,951, provides a CPP derived from eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) which exhibits highly cell-penetrating efficiency and low toxicity. Aspects of delivering the CPP with its cargo into a vertebrate subject are also provided. Further aspects of CPPs and their delivery are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,575,305; 8,614,194 and 8,044,019. CPPs can be used to deliver the CRISPR-Cas system or components thereof. That CPPs can be employed to deliver the CRISPR-Cas system or components thereof is also provided in the manuscript \"Gene disruption by cell-penetrating peptide-mediated delivery of 2014 Apr. 2. [Epub ahead of print], incorporated by reference in its entirety, wherein it is demonstrated that treatment with CPP-conjugated recombinant Cas9 protein and CPP-complexed guide RNAs lead to endogenous gene disruptions in human cell lines. In the paper the Cas9 protein was conjugated to CPP via a thioether bond, whereas the guide RNA was complexed with CPP, forming condensed, positively charged particles. It was shown that simultaneous and sequential treatment of human cells, including embryonic stem cells, dermal fibroblasts, HEK293T cells, HeLa cells, and embryonic carcinoma cells, with the modified Cas9 and guide RNA led to efficient gene disruptions with reduced off-target mutations relative to plasmid transfections.Implantable Devices In another embodiment, implantable devices are also contemplated for delivery of the CRISPR Cas system or component(s) thereof or nucleic acid molecule(s) coding therefor. For example, US Patent Publication 20110195123 discloses an implantable medical device which elutes a drug locally and in prolonged period is provided, including several types of such a device, the treatment modes of implementation and methods of implantation. The device comprising of polymeric substrate, such as a matrix for example, that is used as the device body, and drugs, and in some cases additional scaffolding materials, such as metals or additional polymers, and materials to enhance visibility and imaging. An implantable delivery device can be advantageous in providing release locally and over a prolonged period, where drug is released directly to the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the diseased area such as tumor, inflammation, degeneration or for symptomatic objectives, or to injured smooth muscle cells, or for prevention. One kind of drug is RNA, as disclosed above, and this system may be used/and or adapted to the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention. The modes of implantation in some embodiments are existing implantation procedures that are developed and used today for other treatments, including brachytherapy and needle biopsy. In such cases the dimensions of the new implant described in this invention are similar to the original implant. Typically a few devices are implanted during the same treatment procedure. US Patent Publication 20110195123, provides a drug delivery implantable or insertable system, including systems applicable to a cavity such as the abdominal cavity and/or any other type of administration in which the drug delivery system is not anchored or attached, comprising a biostable and/or degradable and/or bioabsorbable polymeric substrate, which may for example optionally be a matrix. It should be noted that the term \"insertion\" also includes implantation. The drug delivery system is preferably implemented as a \"Loder\" as described in US Patent Publication 20110195123. The polymer or plurality of polymers are biocompatible, incorporating an agent and/or plurality of agents, enabling the release of agent at a controlled rate, wherein the total volume of the polymeric substrate, such as a matrix for example, in some embodiments is optionally and preferably no greater than a maximum volume that permits a therapeutic level of the agent to be reached. As a non-limiting example, such a volume is preferably within the range of 0.1 m3 to 1000 mm3, as required by the volume for the agent load. The Loder may optionally be larger, for example when incorporated with a device whose size is determined by functionality, for example and without limitation, a knee joint, an intra-uterine or cervical ring and the like. The drug delivery system (for delivering the composition) is designed in some embodiments to preferably employ degradable polymers, wherein the main release mechanism is bulk erosion; or in some embodiments, non degradable, or slowly degraded polymers are used, wherein the main release mechanism is diffusion rather than bulk erosion, so that the outer part functions as membrane, and its internal part functions as a drug reservoir, which practically is not affected by the surroundings for an extended period (for example from about a week to about a few months). Combinations of different polymers with different release mechanisms may also optionally be used. The concentration gradient at the surface is preferably maintained effectively constant during a significant period of the total drug releasing period, and therefore the diffusion rate is effectively constant (termed \"zero mode\" diffusion). By the term \"constant\" it is meant a diffusion rate that is preferably maintained above the lower threshold of therapeutic effectiveness, but which may still optionally feature an initial burst and/or may fluctuate, for example increasing and decreasing to a certain degree. The diffusion rate is preferably so maintained for a prolonged period, and it can be considered constant to a certain level to optimize the therapeutically effective period, for example the effective silencing period. The drug delivery system optionally and preferably is designed to shield the nucleotide based therapeutic agent from degradation, whether chemical in nature or due to attack from enzymes and other factors in the body of the subject. The drug delivery system of US Patent Publication 20110195123 is optionally associated with sensing and/or activation appliances that are operated at and/or after implantation of the device, by non and/or minimally invasive methods of activation and/or acceleration/deceleration, for example optionally including but not limited to thermal heating and cooling, laser beams, and ultrasonic, including focused ultrasound and/or RF (radiofrequency) methods or devices. According to some embodiments of US Patent Publication 20110195123, the site for local delivery may optionally include target sites characterized by high abnormal proliferation of cells, and suppressed apoptosis, including tumors, active and or chronic inflammation and infection including autoimmune diseases states, degenerating tissue including muscle and nervous tissue, chronic pain, degenerative sites, and location of bone fractures and other wound locations for enhancement of regeneration of tissue, and injured cardiac, smooth and striated muscle. The site for implantation of the composition, or target site, preferably features a radius, area and/or volume that is sufficiently small for targeted local delivery. For example, the target site optionally has a diameter in a range of from about 0.1 mm to about 5 cm. The location of the target site is preferably selected for maximum therapeutic efficacy. For example, the composition of the drug delivery system (optionally with a device for implantation as described above) is optionally and preferably implanted within or in the proximity of a tumor environment, or the blood supply associated thereof. For example the composition (optionally with the device) is optionally implanted within or in the proximity to pancreas, prostate, breast, liver, via the nipple, within the vascular system and so forth. The target location is optionally selected from the group comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of (as non-limiting examples only, as optionally any site within the body may be suitable for implanting a Loder): 1. brain at degenerative sites like in Parkinson or Alzheimer disease at the basal ganglia, white and gray matter; 2. spine as in the case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); 3. uterine cervix to prevent HPV infection; 4. active and chronic inflammatory joints; 5. dermis as in the case of psoriasis; 6. sympathetic and sensoric nervous sites for analgesic effect; 7. Intra osseous implantation; 8. acute and chronic infection sites; 9. Intra vaginal; 10. Inner ear-auditory system, labyrinth of the inner ear, vestibular system; 11. Intra tracheal; 14. biliary system; 15. parenchymal tissue including and not limited to the kidney, liver, spleen; 16. lymph nodes; 17. salivary glands; 18. dental Intra-articular 21. Brain tissue; 22. Brain ventricles; 23. Cavities, including abdominal cavity (for example but without limitation, for ovary cancer); 24. Intra esophageal and 25. Intra rectal. Optionally insertion of the system (for example a device containing the composition) is associated with injection of material to the ECM at the target site and the vicinity of that site to affect local pH and/or temperature and/or other biological factors affecting the diffusion of the drug and/or drug kinetics in the ECM, of the target site and the vicinity of such a site. Optionally, according to some embodiments, the release of said agent could be associated with sensing and/or activation appliances that are operated prior and/or at and/or after insertion, by non and/or minimally invasive and/or else methods of activation and/or acceleration/deceleration, including laser beam, radiation, thermal heating and cooling, and ultrasonic, including focused ultrasound and/or RF (radiofrequency) methods or devices, and chemical activators. According to other embodiments of US Patent Publication 20110195123, the drug preferably comprises a RNA, for example for localized cancer cases in breast, pancreas, brain, kidney, bladder, lung, and prostate as described below. Although exemplified with RNAi, many drugs are applicable to be encapsulated in Loder, and can be used in association with this invention, as long as such drugs can be encapsulated with the Loder substrate, such as a matrix for example, and this system may be used and/or adapted to deliver the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention. As another example of a specific application, neuro and muscular degenerative diseases develop due to abnormal gene expression. Local delivery of RNAs may have therapeutic properties for interfering with such abnormal gene expression. Local delivery of anti apoptotic, anti inflammatory and anti degenerative drugs including small drugs and macromolecules may also optionally be therapeutic. In such cases the Loder is applied for prolonged release at constant rate and/or through a dedicated device that is implanted separately. All of this may be used and/or adapted to the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention. As yet another example of a specific application, psychiatric and cognitive disorders are treated with gene modifiers. Gene knockdown is a treatment option. Loders locally delivering agents to central nervous system sites are therapeutic options for psychiatric and cognitive disorders including but not limited to psychosis, bi-polar diseases, neurotic disorders and behavioral maladies. The Loders could also deliver locally drugs including small drugs and macromolecules upon implantation at specific brain sites. All of this may be used and/or adapted to the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention. As another example of a specific application, silencing of innate and/or adaptive immune mediators at local sites enables the prevention of organ transplant rejection. Local delivery of RNAs and immunomodulating reagents with the Loder implanted into the transplanted organ and/or the implanted site renders local immune suppression by repelling immune cells such as CD8 activated against the transplanted organ. All of this may be used/and or adapted to the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention. As another example of a specific application, vascular growth factors including VEGFs and angiogenin and others are essential for neovascularization. Local delivery of the factors, peptides, peptidomimetics, or suppressing their repressors is an important therapeutic modality; silencing the repressors and local delivery of the factors, peptides, macromolecules and small drugs stimulating angiogenesis with the Loder is therapeutic for peripheral, systemic and cardiac vascular disease. The method of insertion, such as implantation, may optionally already be used for other types of tissue implantation and/or for insertions and/or for sampling tissues, optionally without modifications, or alternatively optionally only with non-major modifications in such methods. Such methods optionally include but are not limited to brachytherapy methods, biopsy, endoscopy with and/or without ultrasound, such as ERCP, stereotactic methods into the brain tissue, Laparoscopy, including implantation with a laparoscope into joints, abdominal organs, the bladder wall and body cavities. Implantable devices may also include cells, such as epidermal progenitor cells that have been edited or modified to express the CRISPR-Cas systems disclosed herein and embedded with an implantable device, such as a patch. See. Yue et al. \"Engineered Epidermal Progenitor Cells Can Correct Diet-Induced Obesity and Stem Cell (2017) 21(2):256-263. Implantable device technology herein discussed can be employed with herein teachings and hence by this disclosure and the knowledge in the art, CRISPR-Cas system or components thereof or nucleic acid molecules thereof or encoding or providing components may be delivered via an implantable device.Aerosol Delivery Subjects treated for a lung disease may for example receive pharmaceutically effective amount of aerosolized AAV vector system per lung endobronchially delivered while spontaneously breathing. As such, aerosolized delivery is preferred for AAV delivery in general. An adenovirus or an AAV particle may be used for delivery. Suitable gene constructs, each operably linked to one or more regulatory sequences, may be cloned into the delivery vector.Hybrid Viral Capsid Delivery Systems In one aspect, the invention provides a particle delivery system comprising a hybrid virus capsid protein or hybrid viral outer protein, wherein the hybrid virus capsid or outer protein comprises a virus capsid or outer protein attached to at least a portion of a non-capsid protein or peptide. The genetic material of a virus is stored within a viral structure called the capsid. The capsid of certain viruses are enclosed in a membrane called the viral envelope. The viral envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer embedded with viral proteins including viral glycoproteins. As used herein, an \"envelope protein\" or \"outer protein\" means a protein exposed at the surface of a viral particle that is not a capsid protein. For example envelope or outer proteins typically comprise proteins embedded in the envelope of the virus. Non-limiting examples of outer or envelope proteins include, without limit, gp41 and gp120 of HV, hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and M2 proteins of influenza virus.

With regard to targeting moieties, mention is made of Deshpande et al, \"Current trends in the use of liposomes for tumor targeting,\" Nanomedicine (Lond). 8(9), doi:10.2217/nnm.13.118 (2013), and the documents it cites, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Mention is also made of WO/2016/027264, and the documents it cites, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. And mention is made of Lorenzer et al, \"Going beyond the liver: Progress and challenges of targeted delivery of siRNA therapeutics,\" Journal of Controlled Release, 203: 1-15 (2015), and the documents it cites, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. An actively targeting lipid particle or nanoparticle or liposome or lipid bylayer delivery system (generally as to embodiments of the invention, \"lipid entity of the invention\" delivery systems) are prepared by conjugating targeting moieties, including small molecule ligands, peptides and monoclonal antibodies, on the lipid or liposomal surface; for example, certain receptors, such as folate and transferrin (Tf) receptors (TfR), are overexpressed on many cancer cells and have been used to make liposomes tumor cell specific. Liposomes that accumulate in the tumor microenvironment can be subsequently endocytosed into the cells by interacting with specific cell surface receptors. To efficiently target liposomes to cells, such as cancer cells, it is useful that the targeting moiety have an affinity for a cell surface receptor and to link the targeting moiety in sufficient quantities to have optimum affinity for the cell surface receptors; and determining these aspects are within the ambit of the skilled artisan. In the field of active targeting, there are a number of cell-, e.g., tumor-, specific targeting ligands. Also as to active targeting, with regard to targeting cell surface receptors such as cancer cell surface receptors, targeting ligands on liposomes can provide attachment of liposomes to cells, e.g., vascular cells, via a noninternalizing epitope; and, this can increase the extracellular concentration of that which is being delivered, thereby increasing the amount delivered to the target cells. A strategy to target cell surface receptors, such as cell surface receptors on cancer cells, such as overexpressed cell surface receptors on cancer cells, is to use receptor-specific ligands or antibodies. Many cancer cell types display upregulation of tumor-specific receptors. For example, TfRs and folate receptors (FRs) are greatly overexpressed by many tumor cell types in response to their increased metabolic demand. Folic acid can be used as a targeting ligand for specialized delivery owing to its ease of conjugation to nanocarriers, its high affinity for FRs and the relatively low frequency of FRs, in normal tissues as compared with their overexpression in activated macrophages and cancer cells, e.g., certain ovarian, breast, lung, colon, kidney and brain tumors. Overexpression of FR on macrophages is an indication of inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis; accordingly, folate-mediated targeting of the invention can also be used for studying, addressing or treating inflammatory disorders, as well as cancers. Folate-linked lipid particles or nanoparticles or liposomes or lipid bylayers of the invention (\"lipid entity of the invention\") deliver their cargo intracellularly through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Intracellular trafficking can be directed to acidic compartments that facilitate cargo release, and, importantly, release of the cargo can be altered or delayed until it reaches the cytoplasm or vicinity of target organelles. Delivery of cargo using a lipid entity of the invention having a targeting moiety, such as a folate-linked lipid entity of the invention, can be superior to nontargeted lipid entity of the invention. The attachment of folate directly to the lipid head groups may not be favorable for intracellular delivery of folate-conjugated lipid entity of the invention, since they may not bind as efficiently to cells as folate attached to the lipid entity of the invention surface by a spacer, which may can enter cancer cells more efficiently. A lipid entity of the invention coupled to folate can be used for the delivery of complexes of lipid, e.g., liposome, e.g., anionic liposome and virus or capsid or envelope or virus outer protein, such as those herein discussed such as adenovirous or AAV. Tf is a monomeric serum glycoprotein of approximately 80 KDa involved in the transport of iron throughout the body. Tf binds to the TfR and translocates into cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The expression of TfR is can be higher in certain cells, such as tumor cells (as compared with normal cells and is associated with the increased iron demand in rapidly proliferating cancer cells. Accordingly, the invention comprehends a TfR-targeted lipid entity of the invention, e.g., as to liver cells, liver cancer, breast cells such as breast cancer cells, colon such as colon cancer cells, ovarian cells such as ovarian cancer cells, head, neck and lung cells, such as head, neck and non-small-cell lung cancer cells, cells of the mouth such as oral tumor cells. Also as to active targeting, a lipid entity of the invention can be multifunctional, i.e., employ more than one targeting moiety such as CPP, along with Tf; a bifunctional system; e.g., a combination of Tf and poly-L-arginine which can provide transport across the endothelium of the blood-brain barrier. EGFR, is a tyrosine kinase receptor belonging to the ErbB family of receptors that mediates cell growth, differentiation and repair in cells, especially non-cancerous cells, but EGF is overexpressed in certain cells such as many solid tumors, including colorectal, non-small-cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the ovary, kidney, head, pancreas, neck and prostate, and especially breast cancer. The invention comprehends EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibody(ies) linked to a lipid entity of the invention. HER-2 is often overexpressed in patients with breast cancer, and is also associated with lung, bladder, prostate, brain and stomach cancers. HER-2, encoded by the ERBB2 gene. The invention comprehends a HER-2-targeting lipid entity of the invention, e.g., an anti-HER-2-antibody (or binding fragment thereof)-lipid entity of the invention, a HER-2-targeting-PEGylated lipid entity of the invention (e.g., having an anti-HER-2-antibody or binding fragment thereof), a HER-2-targeting-maleimide-PEG polymer-lipid entity of the invention (e.g., having an anti-HER-2-antibody or binding fragment thereof). Upon cellular association, the receptor-antibody complex can be internalized by formation of an endosome for delivery to the cytoplasm. With respect to receptor-mediated targeting, the skilled artisan takes into consideration ligand/target affinity and the quantity of receptors on the cell surface, and that PEGylation can act as a barrier against interaction with receptors. The use of antibody-lipid entity of the invention targeting can be advantageous. Multivalent presentation of targeting moieties can also increase the uptake and signaling properties of antibody fragments. In practice of the invention, the skilled person takes into account ligand density (e.g., high ligand densities on a lipid entity of the invention may be advantageous for increased binding to target cells). Preventing early by macrophages can be addressed with a sterically stabilized lipid entity of the invention and linking ligands to the terminus of molecules such as PEG, which is anchored in the lipid entity of the invention (e.g., lipid particle or nanoparticle or liposome or lipid bylayer). The microenvironment of a cell mass such as a tumor microenvironment can be targeted; for instance, it may be advantageous to target cell mass vasculature, such as the the tumor vasculature microenvironment. Thus, the invention comprehends targeting VEGF. VEGF and its receptors are well-known proangiogenic molecules and are well-characterized targets for antiangiogenic therapy. Many small-molecule inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as VEGFRs or basic FGFRs, have been developed as anticancer agents and the invention comprehends coupling any one or more of these peptides to a lipid entity of the invention, e.g., phage IVO peptide(s) (e.g., via or with a PEG such as APRPG-PEG-modified. VCAM, a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammation, thrombosis and atherosclerosis. CAMs are involved in inflammatory disorders, including cancer, and are a logical target, E- and P-selectins, VCAM-1 and ICAMs. Can be used to target a lipid entity of the invention., e.g., with PEGylation. Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) belong to the family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases. They are involved in tissue remodeling, tumor invasiveness, resistance to apoptosis and metastasis. There are four MMP inhibitors called TIMP1-4, which determine the balance between tumor growth inhibition and metastasis; a protein involved in the angiogenesis of tumor vessels is MT1-MMP, expressed on newly formed vessels and tumor tissues. The proteolytic activity of MT1-MMP cleaves proteins, such as fibronectin, elastin, collagen and laminin, at the plasma membrane and activates soluble MMPs, such as MMP-2, which degrades the matrix. An antibody or fragment thereof such as a Fab fragment can be used in the practice of the invention such as for an antihuman MT-MMP monoclonal antibody linked to a lipid entity of the invention, e.g., via a spacer such as a PEG spacer. ap-integrins or integrins are a group of transmembrane glycoprotein receptors that mediate attachment between a cell and its surrounding tissues or extracellular matrix. Integrins contain two distinct chains (heterodimers) called - and -subunits. The tumor tissue-specific expression of integrin receptors can be been utilized for targeted delivery in the invention, e.g., whereby the targeting moiety can be an RGD peptide such as a cyclic RGD. Aptamers are ssDNA or RNA oligonucleotides that impart high affinity and specific recognition of the target molecules by electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding and hydro phobic interactions as opposed to the Watson-Crick base pairing, which is typical for the bonding interactions of oligonucleotides. Aptamers as a targeting moiety can have advantages over antibodies: aptamers can demonstrate higher target antigen recognition as compared with antibodies; aptamers can be more stable and smaller in size as compared with antibodies; aptamers can be easily synthesized and chemically modified for molecular conjugation; and aptamers can be changed in sequence for improved selectivity and can be developed to recognize poorly immunogenic targets. Such moieties as a sgc8 aptamer can be used as a targeting moiety (e.g., via covalent linking to the lipid entity of the invention, e.g., via a spacer, such as a PEG spacer). The targeting moiety can be stimuli-sensitive, e.g., sensitive to an externally applied stimuli, such as magnetic fields, ultrasound or light; and pH-triggering can also be used, e.g., a labile linkage can be used between a hydrophilic moiety such as PEG and a hydrophobic moiety such as a lipid entity of the invention, which is cleaved only upon exposure to the relatively acidic conditions characteristic of the a particular environment or microenvironment such as an endocytic vacuole or the acidotic tumor mass. pH-sensitive copolymers can also be incorporated in embodiments of the can provide shielding; cysteine-cleavable lipopolymers, are a few examples of pH-sensitive bonds that are quite stable at pH 7.5, but are hydrolyzed relatively rapidly at pH 6 and below, e.g., a terminally alkylated copolymer of N-isopropylacrylamide and methacrylic acid that copolymer facilitates destabilization of a lipid entity of the invention and release in compartments with decreased pH value; or, the invention comprehends ionic polymers for generation of a pH-responsive lipid entity of the invention (e.g., poly(methacrylic acid), poly(diethylaminoethyl methacrylate), poly(acrylamide) and poly(acrylic acid)). Temperature-triggered delivery is also within the ambit of the invention. Many pathological areas, such as inflamed tissues and tumors, show a distinctive hyperthermia compared with normal tissues. Utilizing this hyperthermia is an attractive strategy in cancer therapy since hyperthermia is associated with increased tumor permeability and enhanced uptake. This technique involves local heating of the site to increase microvascular pore size and blood flow, which, in turn, can result in an increased extravasation of embodiments of the invention. Temperature-sensitive lipid entity of the invention can be prepared from thermosensitive lipids or polymers with a low critical solution temperature. Above the low critical solution temperature (e.g., at site such as tumor site or inflamed tissue site), the polymer precipitates, disrupting the liposomes to release. Lipids with a specific gel-to-liquid phase transition temperature are used to prepare these lipid entities of the invention; and a lipid for a thermosensitive embodiment can be dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. Thermosensitive polymers can also facilitate destabilization followed by release, and a useful thermosensitive polymer is poly (N-isopropylacrylamide). Another temperature triggered system can employ lysolipid temperature-sensitive liposomes. The invention also comprehends redox-triggered delivery: The difference in redox potential between normal and inflamed or tumor tissues, and between the intra- and extra-cellular environments has been exploited for delivery; e.g., GSH is a reducing agent abundant in cells, especially in the cytosol, mitochondria and nucleus. The GSH concentrations in blood and extracellular matrix are just one out of 100 to one out of 1000 of the intracellular concentration, respectively. This high redox potential difference caused by GSH, cysteine and other reducing agents can break the reducible bonds, destabilize a lipid entity of the invention and result in release of payload. The disulfide bond can be used as the cleavable/reversible linker in a lipid entity of the invention, because it causes sensitivity to redox owing to the disulfideto-thiol reduction reaction; a lipid entity of the invention can be made reduction sensitive by using two (e.g., two forms of a disulfide-conjugated multifunctional lipid as cleavage of the disulfide bond (e.g., via tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, dithiothreitol, L-cysteine or GSH), can cause removal of the hydrophilic head group of the conjugate and alter the membrane organization leading to release of payload. Calcein release from reduction-sensitive lipid entity of the invention containing a disulfide conjugate can be more useful than a reduction-insensitive embodiment. Enzymes can also be used as a trigger to release payload. Enzymes, including MMPs been found to be overexpressed in certain tissues, e.g., tumor tissues. In the presence of these enzymes, specially engineered enzyme-sensitive lipid entity of the invention can be disrupted and release the payload. an MMP2-cleavable octapeptide (Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Ile-Ala-Gly-Gln) can be incorporated into a linker, and can have antibody targeting, e.g., antibody 2C5. The invention also comprehends light- or energy-triggered delivery, e.g., the lipid entity of the invention can be light-sensitive, such that light or energy can facilitate structural and conformational changes, which lead to direct interaction of the lipid entity of the invention with the target cells via membrane fusion, photo-isomerism, photofragmentation or photopolymerization; such a moiety therefor can be benzoporphyrin photosensitizer. Ultrasound can be a form of energy to trigger delivery; a lipid entity of the invention with a small quantity of particular gas, including air or perfluorated hydrocarbon can be triggered to release with ultrasound, e.g., low-frequency ultrasound (LFUS). Magnetic delivery: A lipid entity of the invention can be magnetized by incorporation of magnetites, such as Fe3O4 or -Fe2O3, e.g., those that are less than 10 nm in size. Targeted delivery can be then by exposure to a magnetic field. Also as to active targeting, the invention also comprehends intracellular delivery. Since liposomes follow the endocytic pathway, they are entrapped in the endosomes (pH 6.5-6) and subsequently fuse with lysosomes (pH<5), where they undergo degradation that results in a lower therapeutic potential. The low endosomal pH can be taken advantage of to escape degradation. Fusogenic lipids or peptides, which destabilize the endosomal membrane after the conformational transition/activation at a lowered pH. Amines are protonated at an acidic pH and cause endosomal swelling and rupture by a buffer effect Unsaturated dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) readily adopts an inverted hexagonal shape at a low pH, which causes fusion of liposomes to the endosomal membrane. This process destabilizes a lipid entity containing DOPE and releases the cargo into the cytoplasm; fusogenic lipid GALA, cholesteryl-GALA and PEG-GALA may show a highly efficient endosomal release; a pore-forming protein listeriolysin O may provide an endosomal escape mechanism; and, histidine-rich peptides have the ability to fuse with the endosomal membrane, resulting in pore formation, and can buffer the proton pump causing membrane lysis. Also as to active targeting, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) facilitate uptake of macromolecules through cellular membranes and, thus, enhance the delivery of CPP-modified molecules inside the cell. CPPs can be split into two classes: amphipathic helical peptides, such as transportan and MAP, where lysine residues are major contributors to the positive charge; and Arg-rich peptides, such as TATp, Antennapedia or penetratin. TATp is a transcription-activating factor with 86 amino acids that contains a highly basic (two Lys and six Arg among nine residues) protein transduction domain, which brings about nuclear localization and RNA binding. Other CPPs that have been used for the modification of liposomes include the following: the minimal protein transduction domain of Antennapedia, a Drosophilia called penetratin, which is a 16-mer peptide (residues 43-58) present in the third helix of the homeodomain; a 27-amino acid-long chimeric CPP, containing the peptide sequence from the amino terminus of the neuropeptide galanin bound via the Lys residue, mastoparan, a wasp venom peptide; VP22, a major structural transportan (18-mer) amphipathic model translocates plasma membranes of cells and endothelial cells by both energy-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The invention comprehends a lipid entity of the invention modified with CPP(s), for intracellular delivery that may proceed via energy dependent macropinocytosis followed by endosomal escape. The invention further comprehends organelle-specific targeting. A lipid entity of the invention surface-functionalized with the triphenylphosphonium (TPP) moiety or a lipid entity of the invention with a lipophilic cation, rhodamine 123 can be effective in delivery of cargo to mitochondria. DOPE/sphingomyelin/stearyl-octa-arginine can delivers cargos to the mitochondrial interior via membrane fusion. A lipid entity of the invention surface modified with a lysosomotropic ligand, octadecyl rhodamine B can deliver cargo to lysosomes. Ceramides are useful in inducing lysosomal membrane permeabilization; the invention comprehends intracellular delivery of a lipid entity of the invention having a ceramide. The invention further comprehends a lipid entity of the invention targeting the nucleus, e.g., via a DNA-intercalating moiety. The invention also comprehends multifunctional liposomes for targeting, i.e., attaching more than one functional group to the surface of the lipid entity of the invention, for instance to enhances accumulation in a desired site and/or promotes organelle-specific delivery and/or target a particular type of cell and/or respond to the local stimuli such as temperature (e.g., elevated), pH (e.g., decreased), respond to externally applied stimuli such as a magnetic field, light, energy, heat or ultrasound and/or promote intracellular delivery of the cargo. All of these are considered actively targeting moieties. An embodiment of the invention includes the delivery system comprising an actively targeting lipid particle or nanoparticle or liposome or lipid bylayer delivery system; or comprising a lipid particle or nanoparticle or liposome or lipid bylayer comprising a targeting moiety whereby there is active targeting or wherein the targeting moiety is an actively targeting moiety.

Green fluorescent protein-tagged adeno-associated virus particles allow the study of cytosolic and nuclear trafficking. J. Virol. 79:11776-11787, Munch R C, et al. 2012. \"Displaying high-affinity ligands on adeno-associated viral vectors Ther.

Adeno-associated virus type 2 VP2 capsid protein is nonessential and can tolerate large peptide insertions at its N terminus. J. Virol. 78:6595-6609, each incorporated herein by reference, one can obtain a modified AAV capsid of the invention. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the modifications described herein if inserted into the AAV cap gene may result in modifications in the VP1, VP2 and/or VP3 capsid subunits. Alternatively, the capsid subunits can be expressed independently to achieve modification in only one or two of the capsid subunits (VP1, VP2, VP3, VP1+VP2, VP1+VP3, or VP2+VP3). One can modify the cap gene to have expressed at a desired location a non-capsid protein advantageously a large payload protein, such as a CRISPR-protein. Likewise, these can be fusions, with the protein, e.g., large payload protein such as a CRISPR-protein fused in a manner analogous to prior art fusions. See, e.g., US Patent Publication 20090215879; Nance et al., \"Perspective on Adeno-Associated Virus Capsid Muscular Dystrophy Gene Therapy,\" Hum Gene Ther. 26(12):786-800 (2015) and documents cited therein, incorporated herein by reference. The skilled person, from this disclosure and the knowledge in the art can make and use modified AAV or AAV capsid as in the herein invention, and through this disclosure one knows now that large payload proteins can be fused to the AAV capsid. Applicants provide AAV capsid-CRISPR protein (e.g., Cas, Cas9) fusions can be a recombinant AAV that contains nucleic acid molcule(s) encoding or providing CRISPR-Cas or CRISPR system or complex RNA guide(s), whereby the CRISPR protein (e.g., Cas, Cas9) fusion delivers a CRISPR-Cas or CRISPR system complex (e.g., the CRISPR protein or Cas or Cas9 or Cpf1 is provided by the fusion, e.g., VP1, VP2, pr VP3 fusion, and the guide RNA is provided by the coding of the recombinant virus, whereby in vivo, in a cell, the CRISPR-Cas or CRISPR system is assembled from the nucleic acid molecule(s) of the recombinant providing the guide RNA and the outer surface of the virus providing the CRISPR-Enzyme or Cas or Cas9. Such as complex may herein be termed an \"AAV-CRISPR or an \"AAV\u2014CRISPR-Cas\" or \"AAV-CRISPR complex\" or AAV\u2014CRISPR-Cas complex.\" Accordingly, the instant invention is also applicable to a virus in the genus Dependoparvovirus or in the family Parvoviridae, for instance, AAV, or a virus of Amdoparvovirus, e.g., Carnivore amdoparvovirus 1, a virus of Aveparvovirus, e.g., Galliform aveparvovirus 1, a virus of Bocaparvovirus, e.g., bocaparvovirus 1, a virus of Copiparvovirus, e.g., copiparvovirus 1, a virus of Dependoparvovirus, e.g., Adeno-associated dependoparvovirus A, a virus of Erythroparvovirus, e.g., Primate erythroparvovirus 1, a virus of Protoparvovirus, e.g., Rodent protoparvovirus 1, a virus of Tetraparvovirus, e.g., Primate tetraparvovirus 1. Thus, a virus of within the family Parvoviridae or the genus Dependoparvovirus or any of the other foregoing genera within Parvoviridae is contemplated as within the invention with discussion herein as to AAV applicable to such other viruses. In one aspect, the invention provides a non-naturally occurring or engineered composition comprising a CRISPR enzyme which is part of or tethered to a AAV capsid domain, i.e., VP1, VP2, or VP3 domain of Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) capsid. In some embodiments, part of or tethered to a AAV capsid domain includes associated with associated with a AAV capsid domain. In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme may be fused to the AAV capsid domain. In some embodiments, the fusion may be to the N-terminal end of the AAV capsid domain. As such, in some embodiments, the C-terminal end of the CRISPR enzyme is fused to the N-terminal end of the AAV capsid domain. In some embodiments, an NLS and/or a linker (such as a GlySer linker) may be positioned between the C-terminal end of the CRISPR enzyme and the N-terminal end of the AAV capsid domain. In some embodiments, the fusion may be to the C-terminal end of the AAV capsid domain. In some embodiments, this is not preferred due to the fact that the VP1, VP2 and VP3 domains of AAV are alternative splices of the same RNA and so a C-terminal fusion may affect all three domains. In some embodiments, the AAV capsid domain is truncated. In some embodiments, some or all of the AAV capsid domain is removed. In some embodiments, some of the AAV capsid domain is removed and replaced with a linker (such as a GlySer linker), typically leaving the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the AAV capsid domain intact, such as the first 2, 5 or 10 amino acids. In this way, the internal (non-terminal) portion of the VP3 domain may be replaced with a linker. It is particularly preferred that the linker is fused to the CRISPR protein. A branched linker may be used, with the CRISPR protein fused to the end of one of the braches. This allows for some degree of spatial separation between the capsid and the CRISPR protein. In this way, the CRISPR protein is part of (or fused to) the AAV capsid domain. Alternatively, the CRISPR enzyme may be fused in frame within, i.e. internal to, the AAV capsid domain. Thus in some embodiments, the AAV capsid domain again preferably retains its N-terminal and C-terminal ends. In this case, a linker is preferred, in some embodiments, either at one or both ends of the CRISPR enzyme. In this way, the CRISPR enzyme is again part of (or fused to) the AAV capsid domain. In certain embodiments, the positioning of the CRISPR enzyme is such that the CRISPR enzyme is at the external surface of the viral capsid once formed. In one aspect, the invention provides a non-naturally occurring or engineered composition comprising a CRISPR enzyme associated with a AAV capsid domain of Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) capsid. Here, associated may mean in some embodiments fused, or in some embodiments bound to, or in some embodiments tethered to. The CRISPR protein may, in some embodiments, be tethered to the VP1, VP2, or VP3 domain. This may be via a connector protein or tethering system such as the biotin-streptavidin system. In one example, a biotinylation sequence (15 amino acids) could therefore be fused to the CRISPR protein. When a fusion of the AAV capsid domain, especially the N-terminus of the AAV AAV capsid domain, with streptavidin is also provided, the two will therefore associate with very high affinity. Thus, in some embodiments, provided is a composition or system comprising a CRISPR protein-biotin fusion and a streptavidin-AAV capsid domain arrangement, such as a fusion. The CRISPR protein-biotin and streptavidin-AAV capsid domain forms a single complex when the two parts are brought together. NLSs may also be incorporated between the CRISPR protein and the biotin; and/or between the streptavidin and the AAV capsid domain. An alternative tether may be to fuse or otherwise associate the AAV capsid domain to an adaptor protein which binds to or recognizes to a corresponding RNA sequence or motif. In some embodiments, the adaptor is or comprises a binding protein which recognizes and binds (or is bound by) an RNA sequence specific for said binding protein. In some embodiments, a preferred example is the MS2 (see Konermann et al. December 2014, cited infra, incorporated herein by reference) binding protein which recognizes and binds (or is bound by) an RNA sequence specific for the MS2 protein. With the AAV capsid domain associated with the adaptor protein, the CRISPR protein may, in some embodiments, be tethered to the adaptor protein of the AAV capsid domain. The CRISPR protein may, in some embodiments, be tethered to the adaptor protein of the AAV capsid domain via the CRISPR enzyme being in a complex with a modified guide, see Konermann et al. The modified guide is, in some embodiments, a sgRNA. In some embodiments, the modified guide comprises a distinct RNA sequence; see, e.g., PCT/US14/70175, incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, distinct RNA sequence is an aptamer. Thus, corresponding aptamer-adaptor protein systems are preferred. One or more functional domains may also be associated with the adaptor protein. An example of a preferred arrangement would be: [AAV AAV capsid domain-adaptor protein]-[modified the positioning of the CRISPR protein is such that the CRISPR protein is at the internal surface of the viral capsid once formed. In one aspect, the invention provides a non-naturally occurring or engineered composition comprising a CRISPR protein associated with an internal surface of an AAV capsid domain. Here again, associated may mean in some embodiments fused, or in some embodiments bound to, or in some embodiments tethered to. The CRISPR protein may, in some embodiments, be tethered to the VP1, VP2, or VP3 domain such that it locates to the internal surface of the viral capsid once formed. This may be via a connector protein or tethering system such as the biotin-streptavidin system as described above. When the CRISPR protein fusion is designed so as to position the CRISPR protein at the internal surface of the capsid once formed, the CRISPR protein will fill most or all of internal volume of the capsid. Alternatively the CRISPR protein may be modified or divided so as to occupy a less of the capsid internal volume. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the invention provides a CRISRP protein divided in two portions, one portion comprises in one viral particle or capsid and the second portion comprised in a second viral particle or capsid. In certain embodiments, by splitting the CRISPR protein in two portions, space is made available to link one or more heterologous domains to one or both CRISPR protein portions. Split CRISPR proteins are set forth herein and in documents incorporated herein by reference in further detail herein. In certain embodiments, each part of a split CRISRP proteins are attached to a member of a specific binding pair, and when bound with each other, the members of the specific binding pair maintain the parts of the CRISPR protein in proximity. In certain embodiments, each part of a split CRISPR protein is associated with an inducible binding pair. An inducible binding pair is one which is capable of being switched \"on\" or \"off\" by a protein or small molecule that binds to both members of the inducible binding pair. In general, according to the invention, CRISPR proteins may preferably split between domains, leaving domains intact. Preferred, non-limiting examples of such CRISPR proteins include, without C2c2, Cas13a, Cas13b, and orthologues. Preferred, non-limiting examples of split points include, with reference to SpCas9: a split position between 202A/203S; a split position between 255F/256D; a split position between 310E/3111; a split position between 534R/535K; a split position between 572E/573C; a split position between 713S/714G; a split position between 1003L/104E; a split position between 1054G/1055E; a split position between 1114N/1115S; a split position between 1152K/1153S; a split position between 1245K/1246G; or a split between 1098 and 1099. In some embodiments, any AAV serotype is preferred. In some embodiments, the VP2 domain associated with the CRISPR enzyme is an AAV serotype 2 VP2 domain. In some embodiments, the VP2 domain associated with the CRISPR enzyme is an AAV serotype 8 VP2 domain. The serotype can be a mixed serotype as is known in the art. The CRISPR enzyme may form part of a CRISPR-Cas system, which further comprises a guide RNA (sgRNA) comprising a guide sequence capable of hybridizing to a target sequence in a genomic locus of interest in a cell. In some embodiments, the functional CRISPR-Cas system binds to the target sequence. In some embodiments, the functional CRISPR-Cas system may edit the genomic locus to alter gene expression. In some embodiments, the functional CRISPR-Cas system may comprise further functional domains. In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme is a Cpf1. In some an some CRISPR is an AsCpf1, although other orthologs are envisaged. FnCpf1 and AsCpf1 are particularly preferred, in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme is external to the capsid or virus particle. In the sense that it is not inside the capsid (enveloped or encompassed with the capsid), but is externally exposed so that it can contact the target genomic DNA). In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme cleaves both strands of DNA to produce a double strand break (DSB). In some embodiments, the CRISPR nickase. some embodiments, CRISPR a dual In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme is a deadCpf1. In some general embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme is associated with one or more functional domains. In some more specific embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme is a deadCpf1 and is associated with one or more functional domains. In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme comprises a some the CRISPR enzyme is associated with the AAV VP2 domain by way of a fusion protein. In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme is fused to Destabilization Domain (DD). In other words, the DD may be associated with the CRISPR enzyme by fusion with said CRISPR enzyme. The AAV can then, by way of nucleic acid molecule(s) deliver the stabilizing ligand (or such can be otherwise delivered) In some embodiments, the enzyme may be considered to be a modified CRISPR enzyme, wherein the CRISPR enzyme is fused to at least one destabilization domain (DD) and VP2. In some embodiments, the association may be considered to be a modification of the VP2 domain. Where reference is made herein to a modified VP2 domain, then this will be understood to include any association discussed herein of the VP2 domain and the CRISPR enzyme. In some embodiments, the AAV VP2 domain may be associated (or tethered) to the CRISPR enzyme via a connector protein, for example using a system such as the streptavidin-biotin system. As such, provided is a fusion of a CRISPR enzyme with a connector protein specific for a high affinity ligand for that connector, whereas the AAV VP2 domain is bound to said high affinity ligand. For example, streptavidin may be the connector fused to the CRISPR enzyme, while biotin may be bound to the AAV VP2 domain. Upon co-localization, the streptavidin will bind to the biotin, thus connecting the CRISPR enzyme to the AAV VP2 domain. The reverse arrangement is also possible. In some embodiments, a biotinylation sequence (15 amino acids) could therefore be fused to the AAV VP2 domain, especially the N-terminus of the AAV VP2 domain. A fusion of the CRISPR enzyme with streptavidin is also preferred, in some embodiments. some embodiments, the biotinylated AAV capsids with streptavidin-CRISPR enzyme are assembled in vitro. This way the AAV capsids should assemble in a straightforward manner and the CRISPR enzyme-streptavidin fusion can be added after assembly of the capsid. In other embodiments a biotinylation sequence (15 amino acids) could therefore be fused to the CRISPR enzyme, together with a fusion of the AAV VP2 domain, especially the N-terminus of the AAV VP2 domain, with streptavidin. For simplicity, a fusion of the CRISPR enzyme and the AAV VP2 domain is preferred in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the fusion may be to the N-terminal end of the CRISPR enzyme. In other words, in some embodiments, the AAV and CRISPR enzyme are associated via fusion. In some embodiments, the AAV and CRISPR enzyme are associated via fusion including a linker. Suitable linkers are discussed herein, but include Gly Ser linkers. Fusion to the N-term of AAV VP2 domain is preferred, in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme comprises at least one Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS). In an aspect, the present invention provides a polynucleotide encoding the present CRISPR enzyme and associated AAV VP2 domain. Viral delivery vectors, for example modified viral delivery vectors, are hereby provided. While the AAV may advantageously be a vehicle for providing RNA of the CRISPR-Cas Complex or CRISPR system, another vector may also deliver that RNA, and such other vectors are also herein discussed. In one aspect, the invention provides a non-naturally occurring modified AAV having a VP2-CRISPR enzyme capsid protein, wherein the CRISPR enzyme is part of or tethered to the VP2 domain. In some preferred embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme is fused to the VP2 domain so that, in another aspect, the invention provides a non-naturally occurring modified AAV having a VP2-CRISPR enzyme fusion capsid protein. The following embodiments apply equally to either modified AAV aspect, unless otherwise apparent. Thus, reference herein to a VP2-CRISPR enzyme capsid protein may also include a VP2-CRISPR protein. In some embodiments, the VP2-CRISPR capsid protein some the VP2-CRISPR enzyme capsid protein further comprises a linker, whereby the VP2-CRISPR enzyme is distanced from the remainder of the AAV. In some embodiments, the VP2-CRISPR enzyme capsid protein further comprises at least one protein complex, e.g., CRISPR complex, such as CRISPR-Cpf1 complex guide RNA that targets a particular DNA, TALE, etc. A CRISPR complex, such as CRISPR-Cas system comprising the VP2-CRISPR enzyme capsid protein and at least one CRISPR complex, such as CRISPR-Cpf1 complex guide RNA that targets a particular DNA, is also provided in one aspect. In general, in some embodiments, the AAV further comprises a repair template. It will be appreciated that comprises here may mean encompassed thin the viral capsid or that the virus encodes the comprised protein. In some embodiments, one or more, preferably two or more guide RNAs, may be comprised/encompassed within the AAV vector. Two may be preferred, in some embodiments, as it allows for multiplexing or dual nickase approaches. Particularly for multiplexing, two or more guides may be used. In fact, in some embodiments, three or more, four or more, five or more, or even six or more guide RNAs may be comprised/encompassed within the AAV. More space has been freed up within the AAV by virtue of the fact that the AAV no longer needs to comprise/encompass the CRISPR enzyme. In each of these instances, a repair template may also be provided comprised/encompassed within the AAV. In some embodiments, the repair template corresponds to or includes the DNA target. In a further aspect, the present invention provides compositions comprising the CRISPR enzyme and associated AAV VP2 domain or the polynucleotides or vectors described herein. Also provides are CRISPR-Cas systems comprising guide RNAs. Also provided is a method of treating a subject in need thereof, comprising inducing gene editing by transforming the subject with the polynucleotide encoding the system or any of the present vectors.

In some embodiments, a single vector provides the CRISPR enzyme through (association with the viral capsid) and at least one of: guide RNA; and/or a repair template. Also provided is a method of treating a subject in need thereof, comprising inducing transcriptional activation or repression by transforming the subject with the polynucleotide encoding the present system or any of the present vectors, wherein said polynucleotide or vector encodes or comprises the catalytically inactive CRISPR enzyme and one or more associated functional domains.

The so-called 'split Cpf1' approach Split Cpf1 allows for the following. The Cpf1 is split into two pieces and each of these are fused to one half of a dimer. Upon dimerization, the two parts of the Cpf1 are brought together and the reconstituted Cpf1 has been shown to be functional. Thus, one part of the split Cpf1 may be associated with one VP2 domain and second part of the split Cpf1 may be associated with another VP2 domain. The two VP2 domains may be in the same or different capsid. In other words, the split parts of the Cpf1 could be on the same virus particle or on different virus particles. In some embodiments, one or more functional domains may be associated with or tethered to CRISPR enzyme and/or may be associated with or tethered to modified guides via adaptor proteins. These can be used irrespective of the fact that the CRISPR enzyme may also be tethered to a virus outer protein or capsid or envelope, such as a VP2 domain or a capsid, via modified guides with aptamer RAN sequences that recognize correspond adaptor proteins. In some embodiments, one or more functional domains comprise a transcriptional activator, a recombinase, DNA a cryptochrome, a inducible/controllable domain, a chemically inducible/controllable domain, an epigenetic modifying domain, or a combination thereof.

In one aspect, the invention provides a vector system comprising one or more vectors. In some embodiments, the system comprises: (a) a first regulatory element operably linked to a tracr mate sequence and one or more insertion sites for inserting one or more guide sequences upstream of the tracr mate sequence, wherein when expressed, the guide sequence directs sequence-specific binding of a AAV-CRISPR complex to a target sequence in a eukaryotic cell, wherein the CRISPR complex comprises a AAV-CRISPR enzyme complexed with (1) the guide sequence that is hybridized to the target sequence, and (2) the tracr mate sequence that is hybridized to the tracr sequence; and (b) said AAV-CRISPR enzyme comprising at least one nuclear localization sequence and/or at least one NES; wherein components (a) and (b) are located on or in the same or different vectors of the system. In some embodiments, component (a) further comprises the tracr sequence downstream of the tracr mate sequence under the control of the first regulatory element. In some embodiments, component (a) further comprises two or more guide sequences operably linked to the first regulatory element, wherein when expressed, each of the two or more guide sequences direct sequence specific binding of a AAV-CRISPR complex to a different target sequence in a eukaryotic cell. In some embodiments, the system comprises the tracr sequence under the control of a third regulatory element, such as a polymerase III promoter. In some embodiments, the tracr sequence exhibits at least 50%, 90%, 95%, or 99% of sequence complementarity the length of the tracr mate sequence when optimally aligned. Determining optimal alignment is within the purview of one of skill in the art. For example, there are publically and commercially available alignment algorithms and programs such as, but not limited to, ClustalW, Smith-Waterman in matlab, embodiments, the AAV-CRISPR complex comprises one or more nuclear localization sequences of sufficient strength to drive accumulation of said CRISPR complex in a detectable amount in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that a nuclear localization sequence is not necessary for AAV-CRISPR complex activity in eukaryotes, but that including such sequences enhances activity of the system, especially as to targeting nucleic acid molecules in the nucleus and/or having molecules exit the nucleus. In some embodiments, the AAV-CRISPR enzyme is a type II AAV-CRISPR system embodiments, the AAV-CRISPR In is mutans, sanguinis, (e.g., a Cpf1 of one of these organisms modified to have or be associated with at least one AAV), and may include further mutations or alterations or be a chimeric Cpf1. The enzyme may be a some embodiments, the AAV-CRISPR enzyme is codon-optimized for expression in a cell.

In general, and throughout this specification, the term \"vector\" refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. Vectors include, but are not limited to, nucleic acid molecules that are single-stranded, double-stranded, or partially double-stranded; nucleic acid molecules that comprise one or more free ends, no free ends (e.g., circular); nucleic acid molecules that comprise DNA, RNA, or both; and other varieties of polynucleotides known in the art. One type of vector is a \"plasmid,\" which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments can be inserted, such as by standard molecular cloning techniques. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein virally-derived DNA or RNA sequences are present in the vector for packaging into a virus (e.g., retroviruses, replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses, replication defective adenoviruses, and adeno-associated viruses). Viral vectors also include polynucleotides carried by a virus for transfection into a host cell. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively-linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as \"expression vectors.\" Common expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. Recombinant expression vectors can comprise a nucleic acid of the invention in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell, which means that the recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulatory elements, which may be selected on the basis of the host cells to be used for expression, that is operatively-linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. Within a recombinant expression vector, \"operably linked\" is intended to mean that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory element(s) in a manner that allows for expression of the nucleotide sequence (e.g., in an in vitro transcription/translation system or in a host cell when the vector is introduced into the host cell).

Aspects of the invention encompass a non-naturally occurring or engineered composition that may comprise a guide RNA (sgRNA) comprising a guide sequence capable of hybridizing to a target sequence in a genomic locus of interest in a cell and a AAV-CRISPR enzyme that may comprise at least one or more nuclear localization sequences, wherein the AAV-CRISPR enzyme comprises one or two or more mutations, such that the enzyme has altered or diminished nuclease activity compared with the wild type enzyme, wherein at least one loop of the sgRNA is modified by the insertion of distinct RNA sequence(s) that bind to one or more adaptor proteins, and wherein the adaptor protein further recruits one or more heterologous functional domains. In an embodiment of the invention the AAV-CRISPR enzyme comprises one or two or more mutations in a residue selected from the group comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of D908, E993, or D1263 according to a further embodiment the AAV-CRISPR enzyme comprises one or two or more mutations selected from the group comprising D908A, E993A, or D1263 as to D1180A as to LbCpf1. In another embodiment, the functional domain comprise, consist essentially of a transcriptional activation domain, e.g., VP64. In another embodiment, the functional domain comprise, consist essentially of a transcriptional repressor domain, e.g., KRAB domain, SID domain or a SID4X domain. In embodiments of the invention, the one or more heterologous functional domains have one or more activities selected from the group comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of methylase activity, demethylase activity, transcription activation activity, transcription repression activity, transcription release factor activity, histone modification activity, RNA cleavage activity and nucleic acid binding activity. In further embodiments of the invention the cell is a eukaryotic cell or a mammalian cell or a human cell. In further embodiments, the adaptor protein is selected from the group comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of MS2, PP7, one loop of the sgRNA is tetraloop and/or loop2. An aspect of the invention encompasses methods of modifying a genomic locus of interest to change gene expression in a cell by introducing into the cell any of the compositions described herein. An aspect of the invention is that the above elements are comprised in a single composition or comprised in individual compositions, e.g., the AAV-CRISPR enzyme delivers the enzyme as discussed as well as the guide. These compositions may advantageously be applied to a host to elicit a functional effect on the genomic level. In general, the sgRNA are modified in a manner that provides specific binding sites (e.g., aptamers) for adapter proteins comprising one or more functional domains (e.g., via fusion protein) to bind to. The modified sgRNA are modified such that once the sgRNA forms a AAV-CRISPR complex (i.e. AAV-CRISPR enzyme binding to sgRNA and target) the adapter proteins bind and, the functional domain on the adapter protein is positioned in a spatial orientation which is advantageous for the attributed function to be effective. For example, if the functional domain comprise, consist essentially of a transcription activator (e.g., VP64 or p65), the transcription activator is placed in a spatial orientation which allows it to affect the transcription of the target. Likewise, a transcription repressor will be advantageously positioned to affect the transcription of the target and a nuclease (e.g., Fok1) will be advantageously positioned to cleave or partially cleave the target. Again, the AAV-CRISPR enzyme can deliver both the enzyme and the modified guide. The skilled person will understand that modifications to the sgRNA which allow for binding of the adapter+functional domain but not proper positioning of the adapter+functional domain (e.g., due to steric hindrance within the three dimensional structure of the CRISPR complex) are modifications which are not intended. The one or more modified sgRNA may be modified at the tetra loop, the stem loop 1, stem loop 2, or stem loop 3, as described herein, preferably at either the tetra loop or stem loop 2, and preferably at both the tetra loop and stem loop 2. As explained herein the functional domains may be, for example, one or more domains from the group comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of methylase activity, demethylase activity, transcription activation activity, transcription repression activity, transcription release factor activity, histone modification activity, RNA cleavage activity, DNA cleavage activity, nucleic acid binding activity, and molecular switches (e.g., light inducible). In some cases it is advantageous that additionally at least one NLS is provided. In some instances, it is advantageous to position the NLS at the N terminus. When more than one functional domain is included, the functional domains may be the same or different. The sgRNA may be designed to include multiple binding recognition sites (e.g., aptamers) specific to the same or different adapter protein. The sgRNA may be designed to bind to the promoter region 1000 +1 nucleic acids upstream of the transcription start site (i.e. TSS), preferably 200 nucleic acids. This positioning improves functional domains which affect gene activation (e.g., transcription activators) or gene inhibition (e.g., transcription repressors). The modified sgRNA may be one or more modified sgRNAs targeted to one or more target loci (e.g., at least 1 sgRNA, at least 2 sgRNA, at least 5 sgRNA, at least 10 sgRNA, at least 20 sgRNA, at least 30 sg RNA, at least 50 sgRNA) comprised in a composition. Further, the AAV-CRISPR enzyme with diminished nuclease activity is most effective when the nuclease activity is inactivated (e.g., nuclease inactivation of at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, or 100% as compared with the wild type enzyme; or to put in another way, a AAV-Cpf1 enzyme or AAV-CRISPR enzyme having advantageously about 0% of activity non-mutated or wild type Cpf1 enzyme or CRISPR enzyme, or no more than about 3% or about 5% or about 10% of the nuclease activity of the non-mutated or wild type Cpf1 enzyme or CRISPR enzyme). This is possible by introducing mutations into the RuvC and HNH nuclease domains of the AsCpf1 and orthologs thereof. For example utilizing mutations in a residue selected from the group comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of D908, E993, or D1263 according to or D1180 according to LbCpf1, and more preferably introducing one or more of the mutations selected from the group comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of D908A, E993A, or D1263 as to inactivated CRISPR enzyme may have associated (e.g., via fusion protein) one or more functional domains, e.g., at least one destabilizing domain; or, for instance like those as described herein for the modified sgRNA adaptor proteins, including for example, one or more domains from the group comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of deaminase activity, methylase activity, demethylase activity, transcription activation activity, transcription repression activity, transcription release factor activity, histone modification activity, RNA cleavage activity, DNA cleavage activity, nucleic acid binding activity, and molecular switches (e.g., light inducible). Preferred domains are Fok1, VP64, P65, HSF1, MyoD1. Preferred domains are act on RNA (ADARs) and other MyoD1. In the event that deaminase is provided, it is advantageous that a guide sequence is designed to introduce one or more mismatches in an RNA duplex formed between the guide sequence and the target sequence. In particular embodiments, the duplex between the guide sequence and the target sequence comprises a A-C mismatch. In the event that Fok1 is provided, it is advantageous that multiple Fok1 functional domains are provided to allow for a functional dimer and that sgRNAs are designed to provide proper spacing for functional use (Fok1) as specifically described in Tsai et al. Nature Biotechnology, Vol. 32, Number 6, June 2014). The adaptor protein may utilize known linkers to attach such functional domains. In some cases it is advantageous that additionally at least one NLS is provided. In some instances, it is advantageous to position the NLS at the N terminus. When more than one functional domain is included, the functional domains may be the same or different. In general, the positioning of the one or more functional domain on the inactivated AAV-CRISPR enzyme is one which allows for correct spatial orientation for the functional domain to affect the target with the attributed functional effect. For example, if the functional domain is a transcription activator (e.g., VP64 or p65), the transcription activator is placed in a spatial orientation which allows it to affect the transcription of the target. Likewise, a transcription repressor will be advantageously positioned to affect the transcription of the target, and a nuclease (e.g., Fok1) will be advantageously positioned to cleave or partially cleave the target. This may include positions other than the N-/C-terminus of the AAV-CRISPR enzyme. Positioning the functional domain in the Rec domain, the Rec2 domain, the HNH domain, or the PI domain of the AsCpf1 protein or any ortholog corresponding to these domains is advantageous; and again, it is mentioned that the functional domain can be a DD. Positioning of the functional domains to the Rec domain or the Rec2 domain, of the AsCpf1 protein or any ortholog corresponding to these domains, in some instances may be preferred. Fok1 functional domain may be attached at the N terminus. When more than one functional domain is included, the functional domains may be the same or different. An adaptor protein may be any number of proteins that binds to an aptamer or recognition site introduced into the modified sgRNA and which allows proper positioning of one or more functional domains, once the sgRNA has been incorporated into the AAV-CRISPR complex, to affect the target with the attributed function. As explained in detail in this application such may be coat proteins, preferably bacteriophage coat proteins. The functional domains associated with such adaptor proteins (e.g., in the form of fusion protein) may include, for example, one or more domains from the group comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of methylase activity, demethylase activity, transcription activation activity, transcription repression activity, transcription release factor activity, histone modification activity, RNA cleavage activity, DNA cleavage activity, nucleic acid binding activity, and molecular switches (e.g., light inducible). Preferred domains are Fok1, VP64, P65, HSF1, MyoD1. In the event that the functional domain is a transcription activator or transcription repressor it is advantageous that additionally at least an NLS is provided and preferably at the N terminus. When more than one functional domain is included, the functional domains may be the same or different. The adaptor protein may utilize known linkers to attach such functional domains. Such linkers may be used to associate the AAV (e.g., capsid or VP2) with the CRISPR enzyme or have the CRISPR enzyme comprise the AAV (or vice versa). Thus, sgRNA, e.g., modified sgRNA, the inactivated AAV-CRISPR enzyme (with or without functional domains), and the binding protein with one or more functional domains, may each individually be comprised in a composition and administered to a host individually or collectively. Alternatively, these components may be provided in a single composition for administration to a host, e.g., the AAV-CRISPR enzyme can deliver the RNA or guide or sgRNA or modified sgRNA and/or other components of the CRISPR system. Administration to a host may be performed via viral vectors, advantageously using the AAV-CRISPR enzyme as the delivery vehicle, although other vehicles can be used to deliver components other than the enzyme of the CRISPR system, and such viral vectors can be, for example, lentiviral vector, adenoviral vector, AAV vector. Several variations are appropriate to elicit a genomic locus event, including DNA cleavage, gene activation, or gene deactivation.

Vectors include, but are not limited to, nucleic acid molecules that are single-stranded, double-stranded, or partially double-stranded; nucleic acid molecules that comprise one or more free ends, no free ends (e.g., circular); nucleic acid molecules that comprise DNA, RNA, or both; and other varieties of polynucleotides known in the art. One type of vector is a \"plasmid,\" which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments can be inserted, such as by standard molecular cloning techniques. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein virally-derived DNA or RNA sequences are present in the vector for packaging into a virus (e.g., retroviruses, replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses, replication defective adenoviruses, and adeno-associated viruses). Viral vectors also include polynucleotides carried by a virus for transfection into a host cell. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively-linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as \"expression vectors.\" Vectors for and that result in expression in a eukaryotic cell can be referred to herein as \"eukaryotic expression vectors.\" Common expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In certain embodiments, a vector system includes promoter-guide expression cassette in reverse order. Recombinant expression vectors can comprise a nucleic acid of the invention in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell, which means that the recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulatory elements, which may be selected on the basis of the host cells to be used for expression, that is operatively-linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. Within a recombinant expression vector, \"operably linked\" is intended to mean that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory element(s) in a manner that allows for expression of the nucleotide sequence (e.g., in an in vitro transcription/translation system or in a host cell when the vector is introduced into the host cell). The term \"regulatory element\" is intended to include promoters, enhancers, internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES), and other expression control elements (e.g., transcription termination signals, such as polyadenylation signals and poly-U sequences). Such regulatory elements are described, for example, in Goeddel, GENE EXPRESSION TECHNOLOGY: METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990). Regulatory elements include those that direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in many types of host cell and those that direct expression of the nucleotide sequence only in certain host cells (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory sequences). A tissue-specific promoter may direct expression primarily in a desired tissue of interest, such as muscle, neuron, bone, skin, blood, specific organs (e.g., liver, pancreas), or particular cell types (e.g., lymphocytes). Regulatory elements may also direct expression in a temporal-dependent manner, such as in a cell-cycle dependent or developmental stage-dependent manner, which may or may not also be tissue or cell-type specific. In some embodiments, a vector comprises one or more pol III promoter (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more pol III promoters), one or more pol II promoters (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more pol II promoters), one or more pol I promoters (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more pol I promoters), or combinations thereof. Examples of pol III promoters include, but are not limited to, U6 and H1 promoters. Examples of pol II promoters include, but are not limited to, the retroviral Rous sarcoma virus promoter, the phosphoglycerol kinase (PGK) promoter, and the EFa promoter. Also encompassed by the term \"regulatory element\" are enhancer elements, such as the 3 of rabbit -globin (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., Vol. 78(3), p. 1527-31, 1981). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector can depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression desired, etc. A vector can be introduced into host cells to thereby produce transcripts, proteins, or peptides, including fusion proteins or peptides, encoded by nucleic acids as described herein (e.g., clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) transcripts, proteins, enzymes, mutant forms thereof, fusion proteins thereof, etc.). Advantageous vectors include lentiviruses and adeno-associated viruses, and types of such vectors can also be selected for targeting particular types of cells. In some embodiments, one or more vectors driving expression of one or more elements of a nucleic acid-targeting system are introduced into a host cell such that expression of the elements of the nucleic acid-targeting system direct formation of a nucleic acid-targeting complex at one or more target sites. For example, a nucleic acid-targeting effector module and a nucleic acid-targeting guide RNA could each be operably linked to separate regulatory elements on separate vectors. RNA(s) of the nucleic acid-targeting system can be delivered to a transgenic nucleic acid-targeting effector module animal or mammal, e.g., an animal or mammal that constitutively or inducibly or conditionally expresses nucleic acid-targeting effector module; or an animal or mammal that is otherwise expressing nucleic acid-targeting effector modules or has cells containing nucleic acid-targeting modules, such as by way of prior administration thereto of a vector or vectors that code for and express in vivo nucleic acid-targeting effector modules. Alternatively, two or more of the elements expressed from the same or different regulatory elements, may be combined in a single vector, with one or more additional vectors providing any components of the nucleic acid-targeting system not included in the first vector. nucleic acid-targeting system elements that are combined in a single vector may be arranged in any suitable orientation, such as one element located 5 with respect to (\"upstream\" of) or 3 with respect to (\"downstream\" of) a second element. The coding sequence of one element may be located on the same or opposite strand of the coding sequence of a second element, and oriented in the same or opposite direction. In some embodiments, a single promoter drives expression of a transcript encoding a nucleic acid-targeting effector module and the nucleic acid-targeting guide RNA, embedded within one or more intron sequences (e.g., each in a different intron, two or more in at least one intron, or all in a single intron). In some embodiments, the nucleic acid-targeting effector module and the nucleic acid-targeting guide RNA may be operably linked to and expressed from the same promoter. In an aspect, the invention provides in a vector system comprising one or more vectors, wherein the one or more vectors comprises: a) a first regulatory element operably linked to a nucleotide sequence encoding the engineered CRISPR protein as defined herein; and optionally b) a second regulatory element operably linked to one or more nucleotide sequences encoding one or more nucleic acid molecules comprising a guide RNA comprising a guide sequence, a direct repeat sequence, optionally wherein components (a) and (b) are located on same or different vectors. The invention also provides an engineered, non-naturally occurring Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated (Cas effector module) (CRISPR-Cas effector module) vector system comprising one or more vectors comprising: a) a first regulatory element operably linked to a nucleotide sequence encoding a non-naturally-occurring CRISPR enzyme of any one of the inventive constructs herein; and b) a second regulatory element operably linked to one or more nucleotide sequences encoding one or more of the guide RNAs, the guide RNA comprising a guide sequence, a direct repeat sequence, wherein: components (a) and (b) are located on same or different vectors, - - the CRISPR complex is formed; - the guide RNA targets the target polynucleotide loci and the enzyme alters the polynucleotide loci, and - the enzyme in the CRISPR complex has reduced capability of modifying one or more off-target loci as compared to an unmodified enzyme and/or whereby the enzyme in the CRISPR complex has increased capability of modifying the one or more target loci as compared to an unmodified enzyme. As used herein, a CRISPR Cas effector module or CRISRP effector module includes, but is not limited to, Cas9, Cpf1, C2c2, Group 13b, and C2c1. In some embodiments, the CRISPR-Cas effector module may be engineered. In such a system, component (II) may comprise a first regulatory element operably linked to a polynucleotide sequence which comprises the guide sequence, the direct repeat sequence, and wherein component (II) may comprise a second regulatory element operably linked to a polynucleotide sequence encoding the CRISPR enzyme. In such a system, where applicable the guide RNA may comprise a chimeric RNA. In such a system, component (I) may comprise a first regulatory element operably linked to the guide sequence and the direct repeat sequence, and wherein component (II) may comprise a second regulatory element operably linked to a polynucleotide sequence encoding the CRISPR enzyme. Such a system may comprise more than one guide RNA, and each guide RNA has a different target whereby there is multiplexing. Components (a) and (b) may be on the same vector. In any such systems comprising vectors, the one or more vectors may comprise one or more viral vectors, such as one or more retrovirus, lentivirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus or herpes simplex virus. In any such systems comprising regulatory elements, at least one of said regulatory elements may comprise a tissue-specific promoter. The tissue-specific promoter may direct expression in a mammalian blood cell, in a mammalian liver cell or in a mammalian eye. In any of the above-described compositions or systems the direct repeat sequence, may comprise one or more protein-interacting RNA aptamers. The one or more aptamers may be located in the tetraloop. The one or more aptamers may be capable of binding MS2 bacteriophage coat protein. In any of the above-described compositions or systems the cell may be a eukaryotic cell or a prokaryotic cell; wherein the CRISPR complex is operable in the cell, and whereby the enzyme of the CRISPR complex has reduced capability of modifying one or more off-target loci of the cell as compared to an unmodified enzyme and/or whereby the enzyme in the CRISPR complex has increased capability of modifying the one or more target loci as compared to an unmodified enzyme. The invention also provides a CRISPR complex of any of the above-described compositions or from any of the above-described systems. The invention also provides a method of modifying a locus of interest in a cell comprising contacting the cell with any of the herein-described engineered CRISPR enzymes (e.g. engineered Cas effector module), compositions or any of the herein-described systems or vector systems, or wherein the cell comprises any of the herein-described CRISPR complexes present within the cell. In such methods the cell may be a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell, preferably a eukaryotic cell. In such methods, an organism may comprise the cell. In such methods the organism may not be a human or other animal. In certain embodiment, the invention also provides a non-naturally-occurring, engineered composition (e.g., engineered Cas9, Cpf1, C2c2, C2c1, Group 29/30, 13b, or any Cas protein which can fit into an AAV vector). Reference is made to FIGS. 19A, 19B, 19C, 19D, and 20A-F in U.S. Pat. No. 8,697,359 herein incorporated by reference to provide a list and guidance for other proteins which may also be used. Any such method may be ex vivo or in vitro.Applications and Methods of Using CRISPR-Cas Systems Methods for Applying the Crispr Cas System In particular embodiments, the methods described herein may involve targeting one or more polynucleotide targets of interest. The polynucleotide targets of interest may be targets which are relevant to a specific disease or the treatment thereof, relevant for the generation of a given trait of interest or relevant for the production of a molecule of interest. When referring to the targeting of a \"polynucleotide target\" this may include targeting one or more of a coding region, an intron, a promoter and any other 5 or 3 regulatory regions such as termination regions, ribosome binding sites, enhancers, silencers etc. The gene may encode any protein or RNA of interest. Accordingly, the target may be a coding region which can be transcribed into mRNA, tRNA or rRNA, but also recognition sites for proteins involved in replication, transcription and regulation thereof. In particular embodiments, the methods described herein may involve targeting one or more genes of interest, wherein at least one gene of interest encodes a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). While lncRNAs have been found to be critical for cellular functioning. As the lncRNAs that are essential have been found to differ for each cell type (C. P. Fulco et al., 2016, Science, doi:10.1126/science.aag2445; N. E. Sanjana et al., 2016, Science, doi:10.1126/science.aaf8325), the methods provided herein may involve the step of determining the lncRNA that is relevant for cellular function for the cell of interest. In an exemplary method for modifying a target polynucleotide by integrating an exogenous polynucleotide template, a double stranded break is introduced into the genome sequence by the CRISPR complex, the break is repaired via homologous recombination an exogenous polynucleotide template such that the template is integrated into the genome. The presence of a double-stranded break facilitates integration of the template. In other embodiments, this invention provides a method of modifying expression of a polynucleotide in a eukaryotic cell. The method comprises increasing or decreasing expression of a target polynucleotide by using a CRISPR complex that binds to the polynucleotide. In some methods, a target polynucleotide can be inactivated to effect the modification of the expression in a cell. For example, upon the binding of a CRISPR complex to a target sequence in a cell, the target polynucleotide is inactivated such that the sequence is not transcribed, the coded protein is not produced, or the sequence does not function as the wild-type sequence does. For example, a protein or microRNA coding sequence may be inactivated such that the protein is not produced. In some methods, a control sequence can be inactivated such that it no longer functions as a control sequence. As used herein, \"control sequence\" refers to any nucleic acid sequence that effects the transcription, translation, or accessibility of a nucleic acid sequence. Examples of a control sequence include, a promoter, a transcription terminator, and an enhancer are control sequences. The inactivated target sequence may include a deletion mutation (i.e., deletion of one or more nucleotides), an insertion mutation (i.e., insertion of one or more nucleotides), or a nonsense mutation (i.e., substitution of a single nucleotide for another nucleotide such that a stop codon is introduced). In some methods, the inactivation of a target sequence results in \"knockout\" of the target sequence. Also provided herein are methods of functional genomics which involve identifying cellular interactions by introducing multiple combinatorial perturbations and correlating observed genomic, genetic, proteomic, epigenetic and/or phenotypic effects with the perturbation detected in single cells, also referred to as \"perturb-seq\". In one embodiment, these methods combine single-cell RNA sequencing interspaced short palindromic (Dixit et al. 2016, Cell 167, 1853-1866; Adamson et al. 2016, Cell 167, 1867-1882). Generally, these methods involve introducing a number of combinatorial perturbations to a plurality of cells in a population of cells, wherein each cell in the plurality of the cells receives at least 1 perturbation, detecting genomic, genetic, proteomic, epigenetic and/or phenotypic differences in single cells compared to one or more cells that did not receive any perturbation, and detecting the perturbation(s) in single cells; and determining measured differences relevant to the perturbations by applying a model accounting for co-variates to the measured differences, whereby intercellular and/or intracellular networks or circuits are inferred. More particularly, the single cell sequencing comprises cell barcodes, whereby the cell-of-origin of each RNA is recorded. More particularly, the single cell sequencing comprises unique molecular identifiers (UMI), whereby the capture rate of the measured signals, such as transcript copy number or probe binding events, in a single cell is determined. These methods can be used for combinatorial probing of cellular circuits, for dissecting cellular circuitry, for delineating molecular pathways, and/or for identifying relevant targets for therapeutics development. More particularly, these methods may be used to identify groups of cells based on their molecular profiling. Similarities in gene-expression profiles between organic (e.g. disease) and induced (e.g. by small molecule) states may identify clinically-effective therapies. Accordingly, in particular embodiments, therapeutic methods provided herein comprise, determining, for a population of cells isolated from a subject, optimal therapeutic target and/or therapeutic, using perturb-seq as described above. In particular embodiments, pertub-seq methods as referred to herein elsewhere are used to determine, in an isolated cell or cell line, cellular circuits which may affect production of a molecule of interest.Effector Protein Acting as Nuclease In some embodiments, the unmodified nucleic acid-targeting effector embodiments, the RNA-targeting effector protein may direct cleavage of one or both nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) strands at the location of or near a target sequence, such as within the target sequence and/or within the complement of the target sequence or at sequences associated with the target sequence. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid-targeting effector protein may direct cleavage of one or both DNA or RNA strands within about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, or more base pairs from the first or last nucleotide of a target sequence. In some embodiments, the cleavage may be staggered, i.e. generating sticky ends. In some embodiments, the cleavage is a staggered cut with a 5 overhang. In some embodiments, the cleavage is a staggered cut with a 5 overhang of 1 to 5 nucleotides, preferably of 4 or 5 nucleotides. In some embodiments, the cleavage site is distant from the PAM, e.g., the cleavage occurs after the 18th nucleotide on the non-target strand and after the 23rd nucleotide on the targeted strand. In some embodiments, the cleavage site occurs after the 18th nucleotide (counted from the PAM) on the non-target strand and after the 23rd nucleotide (counted from the PAM) on the targeted strand. In some embodiments, a vector encodes a nucleic acid-targeting effector protein that may be mutated with respect to a corresponding wild-type enzyme such that the mutated nucleic acid-targeting effector protein lacks the ability to cleave one or both DNA or RNA strands of a target polynucleotide containing a target sequence. The methods according to the invention as described herein comprehend inducing one or more mutations in a eukaryotic cell (in vitro, i.e. in an isolated eukaryotic cell) as herein discussed comprising delivering to cell a vector as herein discussed. The mutation(s) can include the introduction, deletion, or substitution of one or more nucleotides at each target sequence of cell(s) via the guide(s) RNA(s) or sgRNA(s). The mutations can include the introduction, deletion, or substitution of 1-75 nucleotides at each target sequence of said cell(s) via the guide(s) RNA(s) or sgRNA(s). The mutations can include the introduction, deletion, or substitution of 1, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, or 75 nucleotides at each target sequence of said cell(s) via the guide(s) RNA(s) or sgRNA(s). The mutations can include the introduction, deletion, or substitution of 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, or 75 nucleotides at each target sequence of said cell(s) via the guide(s) RNA(s) or sgRNA(s). The mutations include the introduction, deletion, or substitution of 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, or 75 nucleotides at each target sequence of said cell(s) via the guide(s) RNA(s) or sgRNA(s). The mutations can include the introduction, deletion, or substitution of 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, or 75 nucleotides at each target sequence of said cell(s) via the guide(s) RNA(s) or sgRNA(s). The mutations can include the introduction, deletion, or substitution of 40, 45, 50, 75, 100, 200, 300, 400 or 500 nucleotides at each target sequence of said cell(s) via the guide(s) RNA(s) or sgRNA(s).Effector Protein Functioning as Target-Binding Protein Effector Protein Lacking Nuclease Activity As described herein, corresponding catalytic domains of a Cpf1 effector protein may also be mutated to produce a mutated Cpf1 effector protein lacking all DNA cleavage activity or having substantially reduced DNA cleavage activity. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid-targeting effector protein may be considered to substantially lack all RNA cleavage activity when the RNA cleavage activity of the mutated enzyme is about no more than 25%, 10%, 5%, 0.01%, or cleavage activity of the non-mutated form of the enzyme; an example can be when the nucleic acid cleavage activity of the mutated form is nil or negligible as compared with the non-mutated form. An effector protein may be identified with reference to the general class of enzymes that share homology to the biggest nuclease with multiple nuclease domains from the Type V/Type VI CRISPR system. Preferably, the effector protein is Cpf1. In further embodiments, the effector protein is a Type V protein. By derived, Applicants mean that the derived enzyme is largely based, in the sense of having a high degree of sequence homology with, a wildtype enzyme, but that it has been mutated (modified) in some way as known in the art or as described herein. In particular embodiments the Cpf1 effector protein comprise one or more heterologous functional domains. The one or more heterologous functional domains may comprise one or more nuclear localization signal (NLS) domains. The one or more heterologous functional domains may comprise at least two or more NLSs. The one or more heterologous functional domains may comprise one or more transcriptional activation domains. A transcriptional activation domain may comprise VP64. The one or more heterologous functional domains may comprise one or more transcriptional repression domains. A transcriptional repression domain may comprise a KRAB domain or a SID domain. The one or more heterologous functional domain may comprise one or more nuclease domains. The one or more nuclease domains may comprise Fok1. For the purposes of the following discussion, reference to a functional domain could be a functional domain associated with the CRISPR enzyme or a functional domain associated with the adaptor protein. In the practice of the invention and as will be described below, loops of the gRNA may be extended, without colliding with the Cas (e.g. Cpf1) protein by the insertion of distinct RNA loop(s) or distinct sequence(s) that may recruit adaptor proteins that can bind to the distinct RNA loop(s) or distinct sequence(s). The adaptor proteins may include but are not limited to orthogonal RNA-binding protein/aptamer combinations that exist within the diversity of bacteriophage coat proteins. A list of such coat proteins includes, but is not limited to: or orthogonal RNA binding proteins can further recruit effector proteins or fusions which comprise one or more functional domains. In some embodiments, the functional domain may be selected from the group consisting of: transposase domain, integrase domain, recombinase domain, resolvase domain, domain, nuclear-localization signal domains, transcription-regulatory protein (or transcription complex recruiting) domain, cellular uptake activity associated domain, nucleic acid binding domain, antibody presentation domain, histone modifying preferred embodiments, the functional domain is a transcriptional activation domain, such as, without limitation, VP64, p65, MyoD1, RTA, SET7/9 or a histone acetyltransferase. In some embodiments, the functional domain is a transcription repression domain, preferably KRAB. In some embodiments, the transcription repression domain is SID, or concatemers of SID (eg SID4X). In some embodiments, the functional domain is an epigenetic modifying domain, such that an epigenetic modifying enzyme is provided. In some embodiments, the functional domain is an activation domain, which may be the P65 activation domain. In some embodiments, the functional domain is a deaminase or catalytic domain thereof. In some embodiments, the deaminase is a cytidine deaminase Cytidine deaminase may be directed to a target nucleic acid to where it directs conversion of cytidine to uridine, resulting in C to T substitutions (G to A on the complementary strand). In particular embodiments, the cytidine deaminase is APOBEC 1. In some embodiments, the functional domain is a adenosine deaminase. In such an embodiment, nucleotide substitutions can be effected without DNA or RNA cleavage. In particular embodiments, the adenosine deaminase comprises one or more mutations that changes the functionality of the adenosine deaminase relative to wild type, preferably an ability of the adenosine deaminase to deaminate cytidine.Methods for Targeted Deamination of Adenine In one aspect the present invention provides methods for targeted deamination of adenine in an RNA of interest. According to the methods of the invention, the adenosine deaminase (AD) protein is recruited specifically to the relevant Adenine in the RNA of interest by a CRISPR-Cas complex which can specifically bind to a target sequence. In order to achieve this, the adenosine deaminase protein can either be covalently linked to the CRISPR-Cas enzyme or be provided as a separate protein, but adapted so as to ensure recruitment thereof to the CRISPR-Cas complex. In particular embodiments, of the methods of the present invention, recruitment of the adenosine deaminase to the target RNA is ensured by fusing the adenosine deaminase or catalytic domain thereof to the CRISPR-Cas protein, which is a Cpf1 protein. Methods of generating a fusion protein from two separate proteins are known in the art and typically involve the use of spacers or linkers. The Cpf1 protein can be fused to the adenosine deaminase protein or catalytic domain thereof on either the N- or C-terminal end thereof. In particular embodiments, the CRISPR-Cas protein is a Cpf1 protein and is linked to the N-terminus of the deaminase protein or its catalytic domain. The term \"linker\" as used in reference to a fusion protein refers to a molecule which joins the proteins to form a fusion protein. Generally, such molecules have no specific biological activity other than to join or to preserve some minimum distance or other spatial relationship between the proteins. However, in certain embodiments, the linker may be selected to influence some property of the linker and/or the fusion protein such as the folding, net charge, or hydrophobicity of the linker. Suitable linkers for use in the methods of the present invention are well known to those of skill in the art and include, but are not limited to, straight or branched-chain carbon linkers, heterocyclic carbon linkers, or peptide linkers. However, used the linker may also be a covalent bond (carbon-carbon bond or carbon-heteroatom bond). In particular embodiments, the linker is used to separate the CRISPR-Cas protein and the adenosine deaminase by a distance sufficient to ensure that each protein retains its required functional property. Preferred peptide linker sequences adopt a flexible extended conformation and do not exhibit a propensity for developing an ordered secondary structure. In certain embodiments, the linker can be a chemical moiety which can be monomeric, dimeric, multimeric or polymeric. Preferably, the linker comprises amino acids. Typical amino acids in flexible linkers include Gly, Asn and Ser. Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the linker comprises a combination of one or more of Gly, Asn and Ser amino acids. Other near neutral amino acids, such as Thr and Ala, also may be used in the linker sequence. Exemplary linkers are disclosed in Maratea et al. (1985), Gene 40: 39-46; Murphy et al. (1986) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. 83: 8258-62; For example, GlySer linkers GGS, GGGS or GGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 64) linkers can be used in repeats of 3 (such as (GGS)3 (SEQ ID NO: 67), (GGGGS)3) (SEQ ID NO: 66) or 5, 6, 7, 9 or even 12 (SEQ ID NOs: 68-70, SEQ ID NO: 72 and SEQ ID NO: 75) or more, to provide suitable lengths. In particular embodiments, linkers such as (GGGGS)3 are preferably used herein. (GGGGS)6 (GGGGS)9 or (GGGGS)12 may preferably be used as alternatives. Other preferred alternatives are (GGGGS)1, yet a further embodiment, LEPGEKPYKCPECGKSFSQSGALTRHQRTHTR (SEQ ID NO:77) is used as a linker. yet an additional embodiment, the linker is XTEN linker. In particular embodiments, the CRISPR-cas protein is a Cpf1 protein and is linked to the deaminase protein or its catalytic domain by means of an LEPGEKPYKCPECGKSFSQSGALTRHQRTHTR (SEQ ID NO:77) linker. In further particular embodiments, the Cpf1 protein is linked C-terminally to the N-terminus of a deaminase protein or its catalytic domain by means of an LEPGEKPYKCPECGKSFSQSGALTRHQRTHTR (SEQ ID NO:77) linker. In addition, N- and also function as linker (e.g., PKKKRKVEASSPKKRKVEAS (SEQ ID NO:22)). In particular embodiments of the methods of the present invention, the adenosine deaminase protein or catalytic domain thereof is delivered to the cell or expressed within the cell as a separate protein, but is modified so as to be able to link to either the Cpf1 protein or the guide molecule. In particular embodiments, this is ensured by the use of orthogonal RNA-binding protein or adaptor protein/aptamer combinations that exist within the diversity of bacteriophage coat proteins. Examples of such coat proteins include but are not limited to: MS2, naturally occurring or synthetic oligonucleotides that have been engineered through repeated rounds of in vitro selection or SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) to bind to a specific target. In particular embodiments of the methods and systems of the present invention, the guide molecule is provided with one or more distinct RNA loop(s) or distinct sequence(s) that can recruit an adaptor protein. A guide molecule may be extended, without colliding with the Cpf1 protein by the insertion of distinct RNA loop(s) or distinct sequence(s) that may recruit adaptor proteins that can bind to the distinct RNA loop(s) or distinct sequence(s). Examples of modified guides and their use in recruiting effector domains to the CRISPR-Cas complex are provided in Konermann (Nature 2015, 517(7536): 583-588). In particular embodiments, the aptamer aptamer which selectively binds dimerized MS2 bacteriophage coat proteins in mammalian cells and is introduced into the guide molecule, such as in the stemloop and/or in a tetraloop. In these embodiments, the adenosine deaminase protein is fused to MS2. The adenosine deaminase protein is then co-delivered together with the CRISPR-Cas protein and corresponding guide RNA. The RNA targeting and editing system described herein comprising (a) a CRISPR-Cas protein, more particularly a Cpf1 protein which is catalytically inactive or a nickase; (b) a guide molecule which comprises a guide sequence; and (c) an adenosine deaminase protein or catalytic domain thereof; wherein the adenosine deaminase protein or catalytic domain thereof is covalently or non-covalently linked to the CRISPR-Cas protein or the guide molecule or is adapted to link thereto after delivery; wherein the guide sequence is substantially complementary to the target sequence but comprises a non-pairing C corresponding to the A being targeted for deamination, resulting in an A-C mismatch in a RNA duplex formed by the guide sequence and the target sequence. For application in eukaryotic cells, the CRISPR-Cas protein and/or the adenosine deaminase are preferably NLS-tagged. In some embodiments, the components (a), (b) and (c) are delivered to the cell as a ribonucleoprotein complex. The ribonucleoprotein complex can be delivered via one or more lipid nanoparticles. In some embodiments, the components (a), (b) and (c) are delivered to the cell as one or more RNA molecules, such as one or more guide RNAs and one or more mRNA molecules encoding the CRISPR-Cas protein, the adenosine deaminase protein, and optionally the adaptor protein. The RNA molecules can be delivered via one or more lipid nanoparticles. In some embodiments, the components (a), (b) and (c) are delivered to the cell as one or more DNA molecules. In some embodiments, the one or more DNA molecules are comprised within one or more vectors such as viral vectors (e.g., AAV). In some embodiments, the one or more DNA molecules comprise one or more regulatory elements operably configured to express the CRISPR-Cas protein, the guide molecule, and the adenosine deaminase protein or catalytic domain thereof, optionally wherein the one or more regulatory elements comprise inducible promoters. In some embodiments, the CRISPR-Cas protein is a Cpf1 nickase. In some embodiments, the Cpf1 nickase comprises a mutation in the Nuc domain. In some embodiments, the Cpf1 nickase comprises a mutation corresponding to R1226A in AsCpf1. In some embodiments, the CRISPR-Cas protein is a dead Cpf1. In some embodiments, the dead Cpf1 comprises a mutation in the RuvC domain. In some embodiments, the dead Cpf1 comprises a mutation corresponding to D908A or E993A in AsCpf1. In some embodiments of the guide molecule is capable of hybridizing with a target sequence comprising the Adenine to be deaminated within the target RNA to form a RNA duplex which comprises a non-pairing Cytosine opposite to said Adenine. Upon RNA duplex formation, the guide molecule forms a complex with the Cpf1 protein and directs the complex to bind said target RNA of interest. In some embodiments, a Cpf1 guide RNA having a canonical length (e.g., about 24 nt for AsCpf1) is used to form a RNA duplex with the target RNA. In some embodiments, a Cpf1 guide molecule longer than the canonical length (e.g., >24 nt for AsCpf1) is used to form a RNA duplex with the target RNA including outside of the Cpf1-guide complex. In certain example embodiments, the guide sequence has a length of about 29-53 nt capable of forming a RNA duplex with said target sequence. In certain other example embodiments, the guide sequence has a length of about 40-50 nt capable of forming a RNA duplex with said target sequence. In certain example embodiments, the distance between said non-pairing C and the 3 end of said guide sequence is 2-8 nucleotides. In at least a first design, the RNA targeting and editing system comprises (a) an adenosine deaminase fused or linked to a CRISPR-Cas protein, wherein the CRISPR-Cas protein is catalytically inactive or a nickase, and (b) a guide molecule comprising a guide sequence designed to introduce an A-C mismatch in a RNA duplex formed between the guide sequence and the target sequence. In some embodiments, the CRISPR-Cas protein and/or the adenosine deaminase are NLS-tagged, on either the N- or C-terminus or both. In at least a second design, the RNA targeting and editing system comprises (a) a CRISPR-Cas protein that is catalytically inactive or a nickase, (b) a guide molecule comprising a guide sequence designed to introduce an A-C mismatch in an RNA duplex formed between the guide sequence and the target sequence, and an aptamer sequence (e.g., MS2 RNA motif or PP7 RNA motif) capable of binding to an adaptor protein (e.g., MS2 coating protein or PP7 coat protein), and (c) an adenosine deaminase fused or linked to an adaptor protein, wherein the binding of the aptamer and the adaptor protein recruits the adenosine deaminase to the RNA duplex formed between the guide sequence and the target sequence for targeted deamination at the A of the A-C mismatch. In some embodiments, the adaptor protein and/or the adenosine deaminase are NLS-tagged, on either the N- or C-terminus or both. The CRISPR-Cas protein can also be NLS-tagged. The use of different aptamers and corresponding adaptor proteins also allows orthogonal gene editing to be implemented. In one example in which adenosine deaminase are used in combination with cytidine deaminase for orthogonal gene editing/deamination, sgRNA targeting different loci are modified with distinct RNA loops in order to recruit MS2-adenosine deaminase and PP7-cytidine deaminase resulting in orthogonal deamination of A or C at the target loci of interested, respectively. PP7 is the RNA-binding coat protein of the bacteriophage Pseudomonas. Like MS2, it binds a specific RNA sequence and secondary structure. The PP7 RNA-recognition motif is distinct from that of MS2. Consequently, PP7 and MS2 can be multiplexed to mediate distinct effects at different genomic loci simultaneously. For example, an sgRNA targeting locus A can be modified with MS2 loops, recruiting MS2-adenosine deaminase, while another sgRNA targeting locus B can be modified with PP7 loops, recruiting PP7-cytidine deaminase. In the same cell, orthogonal, locus-specific modifications are thus realized. This principle can be extended to incorporate other orthogonal RNA-binding proteins. In at least a third design, the RNA targeting and editing system comprises (a) an adenosine deaminase inserted into an internal loop or unstructured region of a CRISPR-Cas protein, wherein the CRISPR-Cas protein is catalytically inactive or a nickase, and (b) a guide molecule comprising a guide sequence designed to introduce an A-C mismatch in an RNA duplex formed between the guide sequence and the target sequence. CRISPR-Cas protein split sites that are suitable for insertion of adenosine deaminase can be identified with the help of a crystal structure. One can use the crystal structure of an ortholog if a relatively high degree of homology exists between the ortholog and the intended CRISPR-Cas protein. The split position may be located within a region or loop. Preferably, the split position occurs where an interruption of the amino acid sequence does not result in the partial or full destruction of a structural feature (e.g. alpha-helixes or -sheets). Unstructured regions (regions that did not show up in the crystal structure because these regions are not structured enough to be \"frozen\" in a crystal) are often preferred options. The positions within the unstructured regions or outside loops may not need to be exactly the numbers provided above, but may vary by, for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or even 10 amino acids either side of the position given above, depending on the size of the loop, so long as the split position still falls within an unstructured region of outside loop. For Cpf1, several small stretches of unstructured regions have been predicted within the Cpf1 primary structure (see WO2016205711, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference). Unstructured regions, which are exposed to the solvent and not conserved within different Cpf1 orthologs, are preferred sides for splits. The following table presents non-limiting potential split regions within AsCpf1 and LbCpf1. A split site within such a region may be opportune. For Fn, As and Lb Cpf1 mutants, it should be readily apparent what the corresponding position for a potential split site is, for example, based on a sequence alignment. For non-Fn, As and Lb enzymes one can use the crystal structure of an ortholog if a relatively high degree of homology exists between the ortholog and the intended Cpf1, or one can use computational prediction. The RNA targeting and editing system described herein can be used to target a specific Adenine within an RNA sequence for deamination. For example, the guide molecule can form a complex with the CRISPR-Cas protein and directs the complex to bind a target sequence at the target locus of interest. Because the guide sequence is designed to have a non-pairing C, the RNA duplex formed between the guide sequence and the target sequence comprises an A-C mismatch, which directs the adenosine deaminase to contact and deaminate the A opposite to the non-pairing C, converting it to a Inosine (I). Since Inosine (I) base pairs with C and functions like G in cellular process, the targeted deamination of A described herein are useful for correction of undesirable G-A and C-T mutations, as well as for obtaining desirable A-G and T-C mutations. In some embodiments, the RNA targeting and editing system is used for targeted deamination in an RNA molecule in vitro. In some embodiments, the RNA targeting and editing system is used for targeted deamination in an RNA molecule within a cell. The cell can be a eukaryotic cell, such as an animal cell, a mammalian cell, a human, or a plant cell. The invention also relates to a method for treating or preventing a disease by the targeted deamination using the RNA targeting and editing system, wherein the deamination of the A restores a healthy genotype at the target RNA of interest, which remedies a disease caused by a G-A or C-T point mutation or a pathogenic SNP. Examples of disease that can be treated or prevented with the present invention include cancer, haemophilia, beta-thalassemia, Marfan syndrome, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. The invention also relates to a modified cell obtained by the targeted deamination using the RNA targeting and editing system, or progeny thereof, wherein the modified cell comprises an I or G in replace of the A in the target locus of interest compared to a corresponding cell before the targeted deamination. The modified cell can be a eukaryotic cell, such as an animal cell, a plant cell, an mammalian cell, or a human cell. In some embodiments, the modified cell is a therapeutic T cell, such as a T cell sutiable for CAR-T therapies. The modification may result in one or more desirable traits in the therapeutic T cell, including but not limited to, reduced expression of an immune checkpoint receptor (e.g., PDA, CTLA4), reduced expression of HLA proteins (e.g., B2M, H1LA-A), and reduced expression of an endogenous TCR. In some embodiments, the modified cell is an antibody-producing B cell. The modification may results in one or more desirable traits in the B cell, including but not limited to, enhanced antibody production. The invention also relates to a modified non-human animal or a modified plant. The modified non-human animal can be a farm animal. The modified plant can be an agricultural crop. The invention further relates to a method for cell therapy, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof the modified cell described herein, wherein the presence of the modified cell remedies a disease in the patient. In one embodiment, the modified cell for cell therapy is a CAR-T cell capable of recognizing and/or attacking a tumor cell. In another embodiment, the modified cell for cell therapy is a stem cell, such as a neural stem cell, a mesenchymal stem cell, a hematopoietic stem cell, or an iPSC cell. The invention additionally relates to an engineered, non-naturally occurring system suitable for modifying an Adenine in a target RNA of interest, comprising: a guide molecule which comprises a guide sequence, or a nucleotide sequence encoding the guide molecule; a CRISPR-Cas protein, or one or more nucleotide sequences encoding the CRISPR-Cas protein; an adenosine deaminase protein or catalytic domain thereof, or one or more nucleotide sequences encoding; wherein the adenosine deaminase protein or catalytic domain thereof is covalently or non-covalently linked to the CRISPR-Cas protein or the guide molecule or is adapted to link thereto after delivery; wherein the guide sequence is capable of hybridizing with a target sequence comprising an Adenine within the target RNA, but comprises a Cytosine at the position corresponding to the Adenine.

The invention additionally relates to in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo host cell or cell line or progeny thereof comprising the engineered, non-naturally occurring system or vector system described herein. The host cell can be a eukaryotic cell, such as an animal cell, a plant cell, an mammalian cell, or a human cell. Gene Editing or Altering a Target LOCI with Cpf1 In an embodiment, the template nucleic acid alters the structure of the target position by participating in homologous recombination. In an embodiment, the template nucleic acid alters the sequence of the target position. In an embodiment, the template nucleic acid results in the incorporation of a modified, or non-naturally occurring base into the target nucleic acid. The template sequence may undergo a breakage mediated or catalyzed recombination with the target sequence. In an embodiment, the template nucleic acid may include sequence that corresponds to a site on the target sequence that is cleaved by an Cpf1 mediated cleavage event. In an embodiment, the template nucleic acid may include sequence that corresponds to both, a first site on the target sequence that is cleaved in a first Cpf1 mediated event, and a second site on the target sequence that is cleaved in a second Cpf1 mediated event. In certain embodiments, the template nucleic acid can include sequence which results in an alteration in the coding sequence of a translated sequence, e.g., one which results in the substitution of one amino acid for another in a protein product, e.g., transforming a mutant allele into a wild type allele, transforming a wild type allele into a mutant allele, and/or introducing a stop codon, insertion of an amino acid residue, deletion of an amino acid residue, or a nonsense mutation. In certain embodiments, the template nucleic acid can include sequence which results in an alteration in a non-coding sequence, e.g., an alteration in an exon or in a 5 or 3 non-translated or non-transcribed region. Such alterations include an alteration in a control element, e.g., a promoter, enhancer, and an alteration in a cis-acting or trans-acting control element. A template nucleic acid having homology with a target position in a target gene may be used to alter the structure of a target sequence. The template sequence may be used to alter an unwanted structure, e.g., an unwanted or mutant nucleotide. The template nucleic acid may include sequence which, when integrated, results in: decreasing the activity of a positive control element; increasing the activity of a positive control element; decreasing the activity of a negative control element; increasing the activity of a negative control element; decreasing the expression of a gene; increasing the expression of a gene; increasing resistance to a disorder or disease; increasing resistance to viral entry; correcting a mutation or altering an unwanted amino acid residue conferring, increasing, abolishing or decreasing a biological property of a gene product, e.g., increasing the enzymatic activity of an enzyme, or increasing the ability of a gene product to interact with another molecule. The template nucleic acid may include sequence which results in: a change in sequence of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 or more nucleotides of the target sequence. In an embodiment, the template an embodiment, the template nucleic acid is 10 to 1,000, 20 to 900, 30 to 800, 40 to 700, 50 to 600, 50 to 500, 50 to 400, 50 to300, 50 to 200, or 50 to 100 nucleotides in length. A template nucleic acid arm]. The homology arms for recombination into the chromosome, thus replacing the undesired element, e.g., a mutation or signature, with the replacement sequence. In an embodiment, the homology arms flank the most distal cleavage sites. In an embodiment, the 3 end of the 5 homology arm is the position next to the 5 end of the replacement sequence. In an embodiment, the 5 homology arm can extend at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1500, or 2000 nucleotides 5 from the 5 end of the replacement sequence. In an embodiment, the 5 end of the 3 homology arm is the position next to the 3 end of the replacement sequence. In an embodiment, the 3 homology arm can extend at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1500, or 2000 nucleotides 3 from the 3 end of the replacement sequence. In certain embodiments, one or both homology arms may be shortened to avoid including certain sequence repeat elements. For example, a 5 homology arm may be shortened to avoid a sequence repeat element. In other embodiments, a 3 homology arm may be shortened to avoid a sequence repeat element. In some embodiments, both the 5 and the 3 homology arms may be shortened to avoid including certain sequence repeat elements. In certain embodiments, a template nucleic acid for correcting a mutation may designed for use as a single-stranded oligonucleotide. When using a single-stranded oligonucleotide, 5 and 3 homology arms may range up to about 200 base pairs (bp) in length, e.g., at least 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, or 200 bp in length.CPF1 Effector Protein Complex System knockouts. Nuclease-induced NHEJ can also be used to remove (e.g., delete) sequence in a gene of interest. Generally, NHEJ repairs a double-strand break in the DNA by joining together the two ends; however, generally, the original sequence is restored only if two compatible ends, exactly as they were formed by the double-strand break, are perfectly ligated. The DNA ends of the double-strand break are frequently the subject of enzymatic processing, resulting in the addition or removal of nucleotides, at one or both strands, prior to rejoining of the ends. This results in the presence of insertion and/or deletion (indel) mutations in the DNA sequence at the site of the NHEJ repair. Two-thirds of these mutations typically alter the reading frame and, therefore, produce a non-functional protein. Additionally, mutations that maintain the reading frame, but which insert or delete a significant amount of sequence, can destroy functionality of the protein. This is locus dependent as mutations in critical functional domains are likely less tolerable than mutations in non-critical regions of the protein. The indel mutations generated by NHEJ are unpredictable in nature; however, at a given break site certain indel sequences are favored and are over represented in the population, likely due to small regions of microhomology. The lengths of deletions can vary widely; most commonly in the 1-50 bp range, but they can easily be greater than 50 bp, e.g., they can easily reach greater than about 100-200 bp. Insertions tend to be shorter and often include short duplications of the sequence immediately surrounding the break site. However, it is possible to obtain large insertions, and in these cases, the inserted sequence has often been traced to other regions of the genome or to plasmid DNA present in the cells. Because NHEJ is a mutagenic process, it may also be used to delete small sequence motifs as long as the generation of a specific final sequence is not required. If a double-strand break is targeted near to a short target sequence, the deletion mutations caused by the NHEJ repair often span, and therefore remove, the unwanted nucleotides. For the deletion of larger DNA segments, introducing two double-strand breaks, one on each side of the sequence, can result in NHEJ between the ends with removal of the entire intervening sequence. Both of these approaches can be used to delete specific DNA sequences; however, the error-prone nature of NHEJ may still produce indel mutations at the site of repair. Both double strand cleaving Cpf1 molecules and single strand, or nickase, Cpf1 molecules can be used in the methods and compositions described herein to generate NHEJ-mediated indels. NHEJ-mediated indels targeted to the gene, e.g., a coding region, e.g., an early coding region of a gene of interest can be used to knockout (i.e., eliminate expression of) a gene of interest. For example, early coding region of a gene of interest includes sequence immediately following a transcription start site, within a first exon of the coding sequence, or within 500 bp of the transcription start site (e.g., less than 500, 450, 400, 350, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100 or 50 bp). In an embodiment, in which a guide RNA and Cpf1 nuclease generate a double strand break for the purpose of inducing NHEJ-mediated indels, a guide RNA may be configured to position one double-strand break in close proximity to a nucleotide of the target position. In an embodiment, the cleavage site may be between 0-500 bp away from the target position (e.g., less than 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, 50, 40, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 bp from the target position). In an embodiment, in which two guide RNAs complexing with Cpf1 nickases induce two single strand breaks for the purpose of inducing NHEJ-mediated indels, two guide RNAs may be configured to position two single-strand breaks to provide for NHEJ repair a nucleotide of the target position.CPf1 Effector Protein Complexes Can Deliver Functional Effectors Unlike CRISPR-Cas-mediated gene knockout, which permanently eliminates expression by mutating the gene at the DNA level, CRISPR-Cas knockdown allows for temporary reduction of gene expression through the use of artificial transcription factors. Mutating key residues in both DNA cleavage domains of the Cpf1 protein, such as FnCpf1 protein (e.g. the D917A and H1006A mutations of the FnCpf1 protein or or D1180A according to LbCpf1 protein) results of a catalytically inactive Cpf1. A catalytically inactive Cpf1 complexes with a guide RNA and localizes to the DNA sequence specified by that guide RNA's targeting domain, however, it does not cleave the target DNA. Fusion of the inactive Cpf1 protein, such as FnCpf1 protein (e.g. the D917A and H1006A mutations) to an effector domain, e.g., a transcription repression domain, enables recruitment of the effector to any DNA site specified by the guide RNA. In certain embodiments, Cpf1 may be fused to a transcriptional repression domain and recruited to the promoter region of a gene. Especially for gene repression, it is contemplated herein that blocking the binding site of an endogenous transcription factor would aid in downregulating gene expression. In another embodiment, an inactive Cpf1 can be fused to a chromatin modifying protein. Altering chromatin status can result in decreased expression of the target gene. In an embodiment, a guide RNA molecule can be targeted to a known transcription response element (e.g., promoters, enhancers, etc.), a known upstream activating sequence, and/or sequences of unknown or known function that are suspected of being able to control expression of the target DNA. In some methods, a target polynucleotide can be inactivated to affect the modification of the expression in a cell. For example, upon the binding of a CRISPR complex to a target sequence in a cell, the target polynucleotide is inactivated such that the sequence is not transcribed, the coded protein is not produced, or the sequence does not function as the wild-type sequence does. For example, a protein or microRNA coding sequence may be inactivated such that the protein is not produced. In certain embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme comprises one or more mutations selected from the group consisting of D917A, E1006A and D1225A and/or the one or more mutations is in a RuvC domain of the CRISPR enzyme or is a mutation as otherwise as discussed herein. In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme has one or more mutations in a catalytic domain, wherein when transcribed, the direct repeat sequence forms a single stem loop and the guide sequence directs sequence-specific binding of a CRISPR complex to the target sequence, and wherein the enzyme further comprises a functional domain. In some embodiments, the functional domain is a transcriptional activation domain, preferably VP64. In some embodiments, the functional domain is a transcription repression domain, preferably KRAB. In some embodiments, the transcription repression domain is SID, or concatemers of SID (eg SID4X). In some embodiments, the functional domain is an epigenetic modifying domain, such that an epigenetic modifying enzyme is provided. In some embodiments, the functional domain is an activation domain, which may be the P65 activation domain. Use of inactivated CRISPR Cpf1 enzyme for detection methods such as FISH In one aspect, the invention provides an engineered, non-naturally occurring CRISPR-Cas system comprising a catalytically inactivate Cas protein described herein, preferably an inactivate Cpf1 (dCpf1), and use this system in detection methods such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). dCpf1 which lacks the ability to produce DNA double-strand breaks may be fused with a marker, such as fluorescent protein, such as the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eEGFP) and co-expressed with small guide RNAs to target pericentric, centric and teleomeric repeats in vivo. The dCpf1 system can be used to visualize both repetitive sequences and individual genes in the human genome. Such new applications of labelled dCpf1 CRISPR-cas systems may be important in imaging cells and studying the functional nuclear architecture, especially in cases with a small nucleus volume or complex 3-D structures.

This is advantageous as nucleic acids are much easier and cheaper to produce than proteins, and the specificity can be varied according to the length of the stretch where homology is sought. Complex 3-D positioning of multiple fingers, for example is not required. The terms \"polynucleotide\", \"nucleotide\", \"nucleotide sequence\", \"nucleic acid\" and \"oligonucleotide\" are They refer to a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length, either deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides, or analogs thereof. Polynucleotides may have any three dimensional structure, and may perform any function, known or unknown.

A \"wild type\" can be a base line. As used herein the term \"variant\" should be taken to mean the exhibition of qualities that have a pattern that deviates from what occurs in nature. The terms \"non-naturally occurring\" or \"engineered\" are used interchangeably and indicate the involvement of the hand of man. The terms, when referring to nucleic acid molecules or polypeptides mean that the nucleic acid molecule or the polypeptide is at least substantially free from at least one other component with which they are naturally associated in nature and as found in nature. \"Complementarity\" refers to the ability of a nucleic acid to form hydrogen bond(s) with another nucleic acid sequence by either traditional Watson-Crick base pairing or other non-traditional types. A percent complementarity indicates the percentage of residues in a nucleic acid molecule which can form hydrogen bonds (e.g., Watson-Crick base pairing) with a second nucleic acid sequence (e.g., 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 out of 10 being 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% complementary). \"Perfectly complementary\" means that all the contiguous residues of a nucleic acid sequence will hydrogen bond with the same number of contiguous residues in a second nucleic acid sequence. \"Substantially complementary\" as used herein refers to a degree of a region of 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, or more nucleotides, or refers to two nucleic acids that hybridize under stringent conditions. As used herein, \"stringent conditions\" for hybridization refer to conditions under which a nucleic acid having complementarity to a target sequence predominantly hybridizes with the target sequence, and substantially does not hybridize to non-target sequences. Stringent conditions are generally sequence-dependent, and vary depending on a number of factors. In general, the longer the sequence, the higher the temperature at which the sequence specifically hybridizes to its target sequence. Non-limiting examples of stringent conditions are described in detail in Tijssen (1993), Laboratory Techniques In Biochemistry And Molecular Biology-Hybridization With Nucleic Acid Probes Part I, Second Chapter \"Overview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid probe assay\", Elsevier, N.Y. Where reference is made to a polynucleotide sequence, then complementary or partially complementary sequences are also envisaged. These are preferably capable of hybridizing to the reference sequence under highly stringent conditions. Generally, in order to maximize the hybridization rate, relatively low-stringency hybridization conditions are selected: about 20 to 25\u00b0 C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm). The Tm is the temperature at which 50% of specific target sequence hybridizes to a perfectly complementary probe in solution at a defined ionic strength and pH. Generally, in order to require at least about 85% nucleotide complementarity of hybridized sequences, highly stringent washing conditions are selected to be about 5 to 15\u00b0 C. lower than the Tm. In order to require at least about 70% nucleotide complementarity of hybridized sequences, moderately-stringent washing conditions are selected to be about 15 to 30\u00b0 C. lower than the Tm. Highly permissive (very low stringency) washing conditions may be as low as 50\u00b0 C. below the Tm, allowing a high level of mis-matching between hybridized sequences. Those skilled in the art will recognize that other physical and chemical parameters in the hybridization and wash stages can also be altered to affect the outcome of a detectable hybridization signal from a specific level of homology between target and probe sequences. Preferred highly stringent conditions comprise incubation in 50% formamide, 5\u00d7SSC, and 1% SDS at 42\u00b0 or incubation in 5\u00d7SSC and 1% SDS at 65\u00b0 C., with wash in 0.2\u00d7SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65\u00b0 C. \"Hybridization\" refers to a reaction in which one or more polynucleotides react to form a complex that is stabilized via hydrogen bonding between the bases of the nucleotide residues. The hydrogen bonding may occur by Watson Crick base pairing, Hoogstein binding, or in any other sequence specific manner. The complex may comprise two strands forming a duplex structure, three or more strands forming a multi stranded complex, a single self-hybridizing strand, or any combination of these. A hybridization reaction may constitute a step in a more extensive process, such as the initiation of PCR, or the cleavage of a polynucleotide by an enzyme. A sequence capable of hybridizing with a given sequence is referred to as the \"complement\" of the given sequence. As used herein, the term \"genomic locus\" or \"locus\" (plural loci) is the specific location of a gene or DNA sequence on a chromosome. A \"gene\" refers to stretches of DNA or RNA that encode a polypeptide or an RNA chain that has functional role to play in an organism and hence is the molecular unit of heredity in living organisms. For the purpose of this invention it may be considered that genes include regions which regulate the production of the gene product, whether or not such regulatory sequences are adjacent to coding and/or transcribed sequences. Accordingly, a gene includes, but is not necessarily limited to, promoter sequences, terminators, translational regulatory sequences such as ribosome internal ribosome entry sites, enhancers, silencers, insulators, boundary elements, replication origins, matrix attachment sites and locus control regions. As used herein, \"expression of a genomic locus\" or \"gene expression\" is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product. The products of gene expression are often proteins, but in non-protein coding genes such as rRNA genes or tRNA genes, the product is functional RNA. The process of gene expression is used by all known life\u2014eukaryotes (including multicellular organisms), prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) and viruses to generate functional products to survive. As used herein \"expression\" of a gene or nucleic acid encompasses not only cellular gene expression, but also the transcription and translation of nucleic acid(s) in cloning systems and in any other context. As used herein, \"expression\" also refers to the process by which a polynucleotide is transcribed from a DNA template (such as into and mRNA or other RNA transcript) and/or the process by which a transcribed mRNA is subsequently translated into peptides, polypeptides, or proteins. Transcripts and encoded polypeptides may be collectively referred to as \"gene product.\" If the polynucleotide is derived from genomic DNA, expression may include splicing of the mRNA in a eukaryotic cell. The terms \"polypeptide\", \"peptide\" and \"protein\" are used interchangeably herein to refer to polymers of amino acids of any length. The polymer may be linear or branched, it may comprise modified amino acids, and it may be interrupted by non amino acids. The terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified; for example, disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any other manipulation, such as conjugation with a labeling component. As used herein the term \"amino acid\" includes natural and/or unnatural or synthetic amino acids, including glycine and both the D or L optical isomers, and amino acid analogs and peptidomimetics. As used herein, the term \"domain\" or \"protein domain\" refers to a part of a protein sequence that may exist and function independently of the rest of the protein chain. As described in aspects of the invention, sequence identity is related to sequence homology. Homology comparisons may be conducted by eye, or more usually, with the aid of readily available sequence comparison programs. These commercially available computer programs may calculate percent (%) homology between two or more sequences and may also calculate the sequence identity shared by two or more amino acid or nucleic acid sequences. As used herein the term \"wild type\" is a term of the art understood by skilled persons and means the typical form of an organism, strain, gene or characteristic as it occurs in nature as distinguished from mutant or variant forms. A \"wild type\" can be a base line. As used herein the term \"variant\" should be taken to mean the exhibition of qualities that have a pattern that deviates from what occurs in nature. The terms \"non-naturally occurring\" or \"engineered\" are used interchangeably and indicate the involvement of the hand of man. The terms, when referring to nucleic acid molecules or polypeptides mean that the nucleic acid molecule or the polypeptide is at least substantially free from at least one other component with which they are naturally associated in nature and as found in nature. In all aspects and embodiments, whether they include these terms or not, it will be understood that, preferably, the may be optional and thus preferably included or not preferably not included. Furthermore, the terms \"non-naturally occurring\" and \"engineered\" may be used interchangeably and so can therefore be used alone or in combination and one or other may replace mention of both together. In particular, \"engineered\" is preferred in place of \"non-naturally occurring\" or \"non-naturally occurring and/or engineered.\" Sequence homologies may be generated by any of a number of computer programs known in the art, for example BLAST or FASTA, etc. A suitable computer program for carrying out such an alignment is the GCG Wisconsin Bestfit package (University of Wisconsin, U.S.A; Devereux et al., 1984, Nucleic Acids Research 12:387). Examples of other software than may perform sequence comparisons include, but are not limited to, the BLAST package (see Ausubel et al., 1999 ibid\u2014Chapter 18), FASTA (Atschul et al., 1990, J. Mol. Biol., 403-410) and the GENEWORKS suite of comparison tools. Both BLAST and FASTA are available for offline and online searching (see Ausubel et al., 1999 ibid, pages 7-58 to 7-60). However it is preferred to use the GCG Bestfit program. Percentage (%) sequence homology may be calculated over contiguous sequences, i.e., one sequence is aligned with the other sequence and each amino acid or nucleotide in one sequence is directly compared with the corresponding amino acid or nucleotide in the other sequence, one residue at a time. This is called an \"ungapped\" alignment. Typically, such ungapped alignments are performed only over a relatively short number of residues. Although this is a very simple and consistent method, it fails to take into consideration that, for example, in an otherwise identical pair of sequences, one insertion or deletion may cause the following amino acid residues to be put out of alignment, thus potentially resulting in a large reduction in % homology when a global alignment is performed. Consequently, most sequence comparison methods are designed to produce optimal alignments that take into consideration possible insertions and deletions without unduly penalizing the overall homology or identity score. This is achieved by inserting \"gaps\" in the sequence alignment to try to maximize local homology or identity. However, these more complex methods assign \"gap penalties\" to each gap that occurs in the alignment so that, for the same number of identical amino acids, a sequence alignment with as few gaps as possible\u2014reflecting higher relatedness between the two compared sequences\u2014may achieve a higher score than one with many gaps. \"Affinity gap costs\" are typically used that charge a relatively high cost for the existence of a gap and a smaller penalty for each subsequent residue in the gap. This is the most commonly used gap scoring system. High gap penalties may, of course, produce optimized alignments with fewer gaps. Most alignment programs allow the gap penalties to be modified. However, it is preferred to use the default values when using such software for sequence comparisons. For example, when using the GCG Wisconsin Bestfit package the default gap penalty for amino acid sequences is 12 for a gap and 4 for each extension. Calculation of maximum % homology therefore first include the production of an optimal alignment, taking into consideration gap penalties. A suitable computer program for carrying out such an alignment is the GCG Wisconsin Bestfit package (Devereux et al., 1984 Nuc. Acids Research 12 p387). Examples of other software than may perform sequence comparisons include, but are not limited to, the BLAST package (see Ausubel et al., 1999 Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, 4th Ed.\u2014Chapter 18), FASTA (Altschul et al., 1990 J. Mol. Biol. 403-410) and the GENEWORKS suite of comparison tools. Both BLAST and FASTA are available for offline and online searching (see Ausubel et al., 1999, Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, pages 7-58 to 7-60). However, for some applications, it is preferred to use the GCG Bestfit program. A new tool, called BLAST 2 Sequences is also available for comparing protein and and the website of the National Center for Biotechnology information at the website of the National Institutes for Health). Although the final % homology may be measured in terms of identity, the alignment process itself is typically not based on an all-or-nothing pair comparison. Instead, a scaled similarity score matrix is generally used that assigns scores to each pair-wise comparison based on chemical similarity or evolutionary distance. An example of such a matrix commonly used is the BLOSUM62 matrix\u2014the default matrix for the BLAST suite of programs. GCG Wisconsin programs generally use either the public default values or a custom symbol comparison table, if supplied (see user manual for further details). For some applications, it is preferred to use the public default values for the GCG package, or in the case of other software, the default matrix, such as BLOSUM62. Alternatively, percentage homologies may be calculated using the multiple alignment feature in DNASIS (Hitachi Software), based on an algorithm, analogous to CLUSTAL (Higgins D G & Sharp P M (1988), Gene 73(1), 237-244). Once the software has produced an optimal alignment, it is possible to calculate % homology, preferably % sequence identity. The software typically does this as part of the sequence comparison and generates a numerical result. The sequences may also have deletions, insertions or substitutions of amino acid residues which produce a silent change and result in a functionally equivalent substance. Deliberate amino acid substitutions may be made on the basis of similarity in amino acid properties (such as polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and/or the amphipathic nature of the residues) and it is therefore useful to group amino acids together in functional groups. Amino acids may be grouped together based on the properties of their side chains alone. However, it is more useful to include mutation data as well. The sets of amino acids thus derived are likely to be conserved for structural reasons. These sets may be described in the form of a Venn diagram (Livingstone C. D. and Barton G. J. (1993) \"Protein sequence alignments: a strategy for the hierarchical analysis of residue conservation\" Comput. Appl. Biosci. 9: 745-756) (Taylor W. conservation\" J. Theor. Biol. 119; 205-218). Conservative substitutions may be made, for example according to the table below which describes a generally accepted Venn diagram grouping of amino acids. The terms \"subject,\" \"individual,\" and \"patient\" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a vertebrate, preferably a mammal, more preferably a human. Mammals include, but are not limited to, murines, simians, humans, farm animals, sport animals, and pets. Tissues, cells and their progeny of a biological entity obtained in vivo or cultured in vitro are also encompassed. The terms \"therapeutic agent\", \"therapeutic capable agent\" or \"treatment agent\" are used interchangeably and refer to a molecule or compound that confers some beneficial effect upon administration to a subject. The beneficial effect includes enablement of diagnostic determinations; amelioration of a disease, symptom, disorder, or pathological condition; reducing or preventing the onset of a disease, symptom, disorder or condition; and generally counteracting a disease, symptom, disorder or pathological condition. As used herein, \"treatment\" or \"treating,\" or \"palliating\" or \"ameliorating\" are used interchangeably. These terms refer to an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results including but not limited to a therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant any therapeutically relevant improvement in or effect on one or more diseases, conditions, or symptoms under treatment. For prophylactic benefit, the compositions may be administered to a subject at risk of developing a particular disease, condition, or symptom, or to a subject reporting one or more of the physiological symptoms of a disease, even though the disease, condition, or symptom may not have yet been manifested. The term \"effective amount\" or \"therapeutically effective amount\" refers to the amount of an agent that is sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results. The therapeutically effective amount may vary depending upon one or more of: the subject and disease condition being treated, the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the disease condition, the manner of administration and the like, which can readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The term also applies to a dose that will provide an image for detection by any one of the imaging methods described herein. The specific dose may vary depending on one or more of: the particular agent chosen, the dosing regimen to be followed, whether it is administered in combination with other compounds, timing of administration, the tissue to be imaged, and the physical delivery system in which it is carried. The practice of the present invention employs, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of immunology, biochemistry, chemistry, molecular biology, microbiology, cell biology, genomics and recombinant DNA, which are within the skill of the art. See Sambrook, Fritsch and Maniatis, MOLECULAR CLONING: A LABORATORY MANUAL, 2nd edition (1989); CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (F. M. Ausubel, et al. eds., (1987)); the series METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY (Academic Press, Inc.): PCR 2: A PRACTICAL APPROACH (M. J. MacPherson, B. D. Hames and G. R. Taylor eds. (1995)), Harlow and Lane, eds. (1988) ANTIBODIES, A LABORATORY MANUAL, and ANIMAL CELL CULTURE (R. I. Freshney, ed. (1987)). Embodiments of the invention include sequences (both polynucleotide or polypeptide) which may comprise homologous substitution (substitution and replacement are both used herein to mean the interchange of an existing amino acid residue or nucleotide, with an alternative residue or nucleotide) that may occur i.e., like-for-like substitution in the case of amino acids such as basic for basic, acidic for acidic, polar for polar, etc. Non-homologous substitution may also occur i.e., from one class of residue to another or alternatively involving the inclusion of unnatural amino acids such as ornithine (hereinafter referred to as Z), diaminobutyric acid ornithine (hereinafter referred to as B), as O), pyriylalanine, thienylalanine, naphthylalanine phenylglycine. Variant amino acid sequences may include suitable spacer groups that may be inserted between any two amino acid residues of the sequence including alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl or propyl groups in addition to amino acid spacers such as glycine or -alanine residues. A further form of variation, which involves the presence of one or more amino acid residues in peptoid form, may be well understood by those skilled in the art. For the avoidance of doubt, \"the peptoid form\" is used to refer to variant amino acid residues wherein the -carbon substituent group is on the residue's nitrogen atom rather than the -carbon. Processes for preparing peptides in the peptoid form are known in the art, for example Simon R J et al., PNAS (1992) 89(20), 9367-9371 and modelling: Corresponding residues in other Cpf1 orthologs can be identified by the methods of Zhang et al., 2012 (Nature; 490(7421): 556-60) and e1004248)\u2014a computational protein-protein interactions mediated by domain-motif interfaces. PrePPI (Predicting PPI), a structure based PPI prediction method, combines structural evidence with non-structural evidence using a Bayesian statistical framework. The method involves taking a pair a query proteins and using structural alignment to identify structural representatives that correspond to either their experimentally determined structures or homology models. Structural alignment is further used to identify both close and remote structural neighbours by considering global and local geometric relationships. Whenever two neighbors of the structural representatives form a complex reported in the Protein Data Bank, this defines a template for modelling the interaction between the two query proteins. Models of the complex are created by superimposing the representative structures on their corresponding structural neighbour in the template. This approach is further described in Dey et al., 2013 (Prot Sci; 22: 359-66). For purpose of this invention, amplification means any method employing a primer and a polymerase capable of replicating a target sequence with reasonable fidelity. Amplification may be carried out by natural or recombinant DNA polymerases such as TaqGold, T7 DNA polymerase, Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase, and reverse transcriptase. A preferred amplification method is PCR.Functional Domains In some embodiments, one or more functional domains are associated with the Cpf1 effector protein. In some embodiments, one or more functional domains are associated with an adaptor protein, for example as used with the modified guides of Konnerman et al. (Nature 517, 583-588, 29 Jan. 2015). In some embodiments, one or more functional domains are associated with a dead gRNA (dRNA). In some embodiments, a dRNA complex with active Cpf1 effector protein directs gene regulation by a functional domain at on gene locus while an gRNA directs DNA cleavage by the active Cpf1 effector protein at another locus, for example as described analogously in CRISPR-Cas9 systems by Dahlman et al., 'Orthogonal gene control with a catalytically active Cas9 nuclease' (in press). In some embodiments, dRNAs are selected to maximize selectivity of regulation for a gene locus of interest compared to off-target regulation. In some embodiments, dRNAs are selected to maximize target gene regulation and minimize target cleavage For the purposes of the following discussion, reference to a functional domain could be a functional domain associated with the Cpf1 effector protein or a functional domain associated with the adaptor protein. In the practice of the invention, loops of the gRNA may be extended, without colliding with the Cpf1 protein by the insertion of distinct RNA loop(s) or distinct sequence(s) that may recruit adaptor proteins that can bind to the distinct RNA loop(s) or distinct sequence(s). The adaptor proteins may include but are not limited to orthogonal RNA-binding protein/aptamer combinations that exist within the diversity of bacteriophage coat proteins. A list of such coat proteins includes, but is not limited to: Q, or orthogonal RNA binding proteins can further recruit effector proteins or fusions which comprise one or more functional domains. In some embodiments, the functional domain may be selected from the group consisting of: transposase domain, integrase domain, recombinase domain, resolvase domain, domain, nuclear-localization signal domains, transcription-regulatory protein (or transcription complex recruiting) domain, cellular uptake activity associated domain, nucleic acid binding domain, antibody presentation domain, histone modifying preferred embodiments, the functional domain is a transcriptional activation domain, such as, without limitation, VP64, p65, MyoD1, RTA, SET7/9 or a histone acetyltransferase. In some embodiments, the functional domain is a transcription repression domain, preferably KRAB. In some embodiments, the transcription repression domain is SID, or concatemers of SID (eg SID4X). In some embodiments, the functional domain is an epigenetic modifying domain, such that an epigenetic modifying enzyme is provided. In some embodiments, the functional domain is an activation domain, which may be the P65 activation domain. In some embodiments, the one or more functional domains is an NLS (Nuclear Localization Sequence) or an NES (Nuclear Export Signal). In some embodiments, the one or more functional domains is a transcriptional activation domain comprises VP64, p65, MyoD1, references herein to activation (or activator) domains in respect of those associated with the CRISPR enzyme include any known transcriptional activation domain and MyoD1, or a histone acetyltransferase. In some embodiments, the one or more functional domains is a transcriptional repressor domain. In some embodiments, the transcriptional repressor domain a KRAB domain. In some embodiments, the transcriptional repressor domain is a NuE domain, NcoR domain, SID domain or a SID4X domain. In some embodiments, the one or more functional domains have one or more activities comprising methylase activity, demethylase activity, transcription activation activity, transcription repression activity, transcription release factor activity, histone modification activity, RNA cleavage activity, DNA cleavage activity, DNA integration activity or nucleic acid binding activity. Histone modifying domains are also preferred in some embodiments. Exemplary histone modifying domains are discussed below. Transposase domains, HR (Homologous Recombination) machinery domains, recombinase domains, and/or integrase domains are also preferred as the present functional domains. In some embodiments, DNA integration activity includes HR machinery domains, integrase domains, recombinase domains and/or transposase domains. Histone acetyltransferases are preferred in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the DNA cleavage activity is due to a nuclease. In some embodiments, J. Keith Joung 32(6): 569-77 (2014), dimeric RNA-guided Nucleases that recognize extended sequences and can edit endogenous genes with high efficiencies in human cells. In some embodiments, the one or more functional domains is attached to the Cpf1 effector protein so that upon binding to the sgRNA and target the functional domain is in a spatial orientation allowing for the functional domain to function in its attributed function. In some embodiments, the one or more functional domains is attached to the adaptor protein so that upon binding of the Cpf1 effector protein to the gRNA and target, the functional domain is in a spatial orientation allowing for the functional domain to function in its attributed function. In an aspect the invention provides a composition as herein discussed wherein the one or more functional domains is attached to the Cpf1 effector protein or adaptor protein via a GlySer linker, as discussed Repressive histone effector domains are known and an exemplary list is provided below. In the exemplary table, preference was given to proteins and functional truncations of small size to facilitate efficient viral packaging (for instance via AAV). In general, however, the domains may include HDACs, histone methyltransferases (HMTs), and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors, as well as HDAC and HMT recruiting proteins. The functional domain may be or include, in some embodiments, HDAC Inhibitor Effector Domains. Accordingly, the repress or domains of the present invention may be selected from histone methyltransferases (HMIVTs), histone HDAC and HTrecruiting proteins. The HDAC domain may be any of those in the the functional domain may be aHDAC Recruiter Effector Domain. Preferred examples include those in the below, namely MCP2, MBD2b, Sin3a, NcoR, SALL1, RCOR1. NcoR is exemplified in the present Examples and, although preferred, itis envisaged that others in the class will also be useful. In some embodiment, the functional domain may be a Methyltransferase (HMT) Effector Domain. Preferred examples include those in the namely NUE, vSET, exemplified in the present Examples and, although preferred, it is envisaged that others in the class will also be useful. In some embodiment, the functional domain may be a Histone Methyltransferase (HMT) Recruiter Effector Domain. Preferred examples include those in the Table below, namely Hp1a, PET19, and NIPP1. In some embodiment, the functional domain may be Histone Acetyltransferase Inhibitor Effector Domain. Preferred examples include SET/TAF-1 listed in the Table below. It is also preferred to target endogenous (regulatory) control elements (such as enhancers and silencers) in addition to a promoter or promoter-proximal elements. Thus, the invention can also be used to target endogenous control elements (including enhancers and silencers) in addition to targeting of the promoter. These control elements can be located upstream and downstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS), starting from 200 bp from the TSS to 100 kb away. Targeting of known control elements can be used to activate or repress the gene of interest. In some cases, a single control element can influence the transcription of multiple target genes. Targeting of a single control element could therefore be used to control the transcription of multiple genes simultaneously. Targeting of putative control elements on the other hand (e.g. by tiling the region of the putative control element as well as 200 bp up to 100 kB around the element) can be used as a means to verify such elements (by measuring the transcription of the gene of interest) or to detect novel control elements (e.g. by tiling 100 kb upstream and downstream of the TSS of the gene of interest). In addition, targeting of putative control elements can be useful in the context of understanding genetic causes of disease. Many mutations and common SNP variants associated with disease phenotypes are located outside coding regions. Targeting of such regions with either the activation or repression systems described herein can be followed by readout of transcription of either a) a set of putative targets (e.g. a set of genes located in closest proximity to the control element) or b) whole-transcriptome readout by e.g. RNAseq or microarray. This would allow for the identification of likely candidate genes involved in the disease phenotype. Such candidate genes could be useful as novel drug targets. Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors are mentioned herein. However, an alternative in some embodiments is for the one or more functional domains to comprise an acetyltransferase, preferably a histone acetyltransferase. These are useful in the field of epigenomics, for example in methods of interrogating the epigenome. Methods of interrogating the epigenome may include, for example, targeting epigenomic sequences. Targeting epigenomic sequences may include the guide being directed to an epigenomic target sequence. Epigenomic target sequence may include, in some embodiments, include a promoter, silencer or an enhancer sequence. Use of a functional domain linked to a Cpf1 effector protein as described herein, preferably a dead-Cpf1 effector protein, more preferably a dead-FnCpf1 effector protein, to target epigenomic sequences can be used to activate or repress promoters, silencer or enhancers. Examples of acetyltransferases are known but may include, in some embodiments, histone acetyltransferases. In some embodiments, the histone acetyltransferase may the catalytic core of the human acetyltransferase p300 (Gerbasch & Reddy, Nature Biotech 6th April 2015). In some preferred embodiments, the functional domain is linked to a dead-Cpf1 effector protein to target and activate epigenomic sequences such as promoters or enhancers. One or more guides directed to such promoters or enhancers may also be provided to direct the binding of the CRISPR enzyme to such promoters or enhancers. The term \"associated with\" is used here in relation to the association of the functional domain to the Cpf1 effector protein or the adaptor protein. It is used in respect of how one molecule 'associates' with respect to another, for example between an adaptor protein and a functional domain, or between the Cpf1 effector protein and a functional domain. In the case of such protein-protein interactions, this association may be viewed in terms of recognition in the way an antibody recognizes an epitope. Alternatively, one protein may be associated with another protein via a fusion of the two, for instance one subunit being fused to another subunit. Fusion typically occurs by addition of the amino acid sequence of one to that of the other, for instance via splicing together of the nucleotide sequences that encode each protein or subunit. Alternatively, this may essentially be viewed as binding between two molecules or direct linkage, such as a fusion protein. In any event, the fusion protein may include a linker between the two subunits of interest (i.e. between the enzyme and the functional domain or between the adaptor protein and the functional domain). Thus, in some embodiments, the Cpf1 effector protein or adaptor protein is associated with a functional domain by binding thereto. In other embodiments, the Cpf1 effector protein or adaptor protein is associated with a functional domain because the two are fused together, optionally via an intermediate linker. Attachment of a functional domain or fusion protein can be via a linker, e.g., a flexible glycine-serine (GlyGlyGlySer) or (GGGS)3 or a alpha-helical linker such (Ala(GluAlaAlaAlaLys)Ala). Linkers such as (GGGGS)3 are preferably used herein to separate protein or peptide domains. (GGGGS)3 is preferable because it is a relatively long linker (15 amino acids). The glycine residues are the flexible and the serine residues enhance the chance that the linker is on the outside of the protein. (GGGGS)6 (GGGGS)9 or (GGGGS)12 may preferably be used as alternatives. alternatives (GGGGS)1, available, but highly flexible linkers are thought to work best to allow for maximum opportunity for the 2 parts of the Cpf1 to come together and thus reconstitute Cpf1 activity. One alternative is that the NLS of nucleoplasmin can be used as a linker. For example, a linker can also be used between the Cpf1 and any functional domain. Again, a (GGGGS)3 linker may be used here (or the 6, 9, or 12 repeat versions therefore) or the NLS of nucleoplasmin can be used as a linker between Cpf1 and the functional domain.Multiplex (Tandem) Targeting Approach The inventors have shown that CRISPR enzymes as defined herein can employ more than one RNA guide without losing activity. This enables the use of the CRISPR enzymes, systems or complexes as defined herein for targeting multiple DNA targets, genes or gene loci, with a single enzyme, system or complex as defined herein. The guide RNAs may be tandemly arranged, optionally separated by a nucleotide sequence such as a direct repeat as defined herein. The position of the different guide RNAs is the tandem does not influence the activity. Accordingly, the Cpf1 enzyme may form part of a CRISPR system or complex, which further comprises tandemly arranged guide RNAs (gRNAs) comprising a series of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 25, 25, 30, or more than 30 guide sequences, each capable of specifically hybridizing to a target sequence in a genomic locus of interest in a cell. In some embodiments, the functional Cpf1 CRISPR system or complex binds to the multiple target sequences. In some embodiments, the functional CRISPR system or complex may edit the multiple target sequences, e.g., the target sequences may comprise a genomic locus, and in some embodiments there may be an alteration of gene expression. In some embodiments, the functional CRISPR system or complex may comprise further functional domains. In some embodiments, the invention provides a method for altering or modifying expression of multiple gene products. The method may comprise introducing into a cell containing said target nucleic acids, e.g., DNA molecules, or containing and expressing target nucleic acid, e.g., DNA molecules; for instance, the target nucleic acids may encode gene products or provide for expression of gene products (e.g., regulatory sequences). In some general embodiments, the Cpf1 enzyme used for multiplex targeting is associated with one or more functional domains. In some more specific embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme used for multiplex targeting is a deadCpf1 as defined herein elsewhere.

As such the nucleic acid-targeting complex has a broad spectrum of applications in, e.g., gene therapy, drug screening, disease diagnosis, and prognosis. An exemplary nucleic acid-targeting complex comprises a DNA or RNA-targeting effector protein complexed with a guide RNA hybridized to a target sequence within the target locus of interest.

The term plant also encompasses Algae, which are mainly photoautotrophs unified primarily by their lack of roots, leaves and other organs that characterize higher plants. The methods for genome editing using the Cpf1 system as described herein can be used to confer desired traits on essentially any plant. A wide variety of plants and plant cell systems may be engineered for the desired physiological and agronomic characteristics described herein using the nucleic acid constructs of the present disclosure and the various transformation methods mentioned above. In preferred embodiments, target plants and plant cells for engineering include, but are not limited to, those monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants, such as crops including grain crops (e.g., wheat, maize, rice, millet, barley), fruit crops (e.g., tomato, apple, pear, strawberry, orange), forage crops (e.g., alfalfa), root vegetable crops (e.g., carrot, potato, sugar beets, yam), leafy vegetable crops (e.g., lettuce, spinach); flowering plants (e.g., petunia, rose, chrysanthemum), conifers and pine trees (e.g., pine fir, spruce); plants used in phytoremediation (e.g., heavy metal accumulating plants); oil crops (e.g., sunflower, rape seed) and plants used for experimental purposes (e.g., Arabidopsis). Thus, the methods and CRISPR-Cas systems can be used over a broad range of plants, such as for example with dicotyledonous plants belonging to CRISPR-Cas systems can be used with monocotyledonous plants such as those belonging to with plants belonging to Gymnospermae, e.g those belonging to the orders Cupressales and Gnetales. and methods of use described herein can be used over a broad range of plant species, included in the non-limitative list CRISPR systems and methods of use can also be used over a broad range of \"algae\" or \"algae cells\"; including for example algea selected from several eukaryotic phyla, including the Rhodophyta (red Chlorophyta (brown algae), Bacillariophyta Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). The term a plant, i.e., a \"plant tissue\" may be treated according to the methods of the present invention to produce an improved plant. Plant tissue also encompasses plant cells. The term \"plant cell\" as used herein refers to individual units of a living plant, either in an intact whole plant or in an isolated form grown in in vitro tissue cultures, on media or agar, in suspension in a growth media or buffer or as a part of higher organized unites, such as, for example, plant tissue, a plant organ, or a whole plant. A \"protoplast\" refers to a plant cell that has had its protective cell wall completely or partially removed using, for example, mechanical or enzymatic means resulting in an intact biochemical competent unit of living plant that can reform their cell wall, proliferate and regenerate grow into a whole plant under proper growing conditions. The term \"transformation\" broadly refers to the process by which a plant host is genetically modified by the introduction of DNA by means of Agrobacteria or one of a variety of chemical or physical methods. As used herein, the term \"plant host\" refers to plants, including any cells, tissues, organs, or progeny of the plants. Many suitable plant tissues or plant cells can be transformed and include, but are not limited to, protoplasts, somatic embryos, pollen, leaves, seedlings, stems, calli, stolons, microtubers, and shoots. A plant tissue also refers to any clone of such a plant, seed, progeny, propagule whether generated sexually or asexually, and descendents of any of these, such as cuttings or seed. The term \"transformed\" as used herein, refers to a cell, tissue, organ, or organism into which a foreign DNA molecule, such as a construct, has been introduced. The introduced DNA molecule may be integrated into the genomic DNA of the recipient cell, tissue, organ, or organism such that the introduced DNA molecule is transmitted to the subsequent progeny. In these embodiments, the \"transformed\" or \"transgenic\" cell or plant may also include progeny of the cell or plant and progeny produced from a breeding program employing such a transformed plant as a parent in a cross and exhibiting an altered phenotype resulting from the presence of the introduced DNA molecule. Preferably, the transgenic plant is fertile and capable of transmitting the introduced DNA to progeny through sexual reproduction. The term \"progeny\", such as the progeny of a transgenic plant, is one that is born of, begotten by, or derived from a plant or the transgenic plant. The introduced DNA molecule may also be transiently introduced into the recipient cell such that the introduced DNA molecule is not inherited by subsequent progeny and thus not considered \"transgenic\". Accordingly, as used herein, a \"non-transgenic\" plant or plant cell is a plant which does not contain a foreign DNA stably integrated into its genome. The term \"plant promoter\" as used herein is a promoter capable of initiating transcription in plant cells, whether or not its origin is a plant cell. Exemplary suitable plant promoters include, but are not limited to, those that are obtained from plants, plant viruses, and bacteria such as Agrobacterium or Rhizobium which comprise genes expressed in plant cells. As used herein, a \"fungal cell\" refers to any type of eukaryotic cell within the kingdom of fungi. Phyla within the kingdom of fungi Glomeromycota, Microsporidia, molds, and filamentous fungi. In some embodiments, the fungal cell is a yeast cell. As used herein, the term \"yeast cell\" refers to any fungal cell within the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Yeast cells may include budding yeast cells, fission yeast cells, and mold cells. Without being limited to these organisms, many types of yeast used in laboratory and industrial settings are part of the phylum Ascomycota. In some embodiments, the yeast cell is an S. cerervisiae, Kluyveromyces marxianus, or Issatchenkia orientalis cell. Other yeast the fungal cell is a cell. As used herein, the term \"filamentous fungal cell\" refers to any type of fungal cell that grows in filaments, i.e., hyphae or mycelia. Examples of filamentous fungal cells may some embodiments, the fungal is an industrial strain. As used herein, \"industrial strain\" refers to any strain of fungal cell used in or isolated from an industrial process, e.g., production of a product on a commercial or industrial scale. Industrial strain may refer to a fungal species that is typically used in an industrial process, or it may refer to an isolate of a fungal species that may be also used for non-industrial purposes (e.g., laboratory research). Examples of industrial processes may include fermentation (e.g., in production of food or beverage products), distillation, biofuel production, production of a compound, and production of a polypeptide. Examples of industrial strains may include, without limitation, JAY270 and ATCC4124. In some embodiments, the fungal cell is a polyploid cell. As used herein, a \"polyploid\" cell may refer to any cell whose genome is present in more than one copy. A polyploid cell may refer to a type of cell that is naturally found in a polyploid state, or it may refer to a cell that has been induced to exist in a polyploid state (e.g., through specific regulation, alteration, inactivation, activation, or modification of meiosis, cytokinesis, or DNA replication). A polyploid cell may refer to a cell whose entire genome is polyploid, or it may refer to a cell that is polyploid in a particular genomic locus of interest. Without wishing to be bound to theory, it is thought that the abundance of guideRNA may more often be a rate-limiting component in genome engineering of polyploid cells than in haploid cells, and thus the methods using the Cpf1 CRISPRS system described herein may take advantage of using a certain fungal cell type. In some embodiments, the fungal cell is a diploid cell. As used herein, a \"diploid\" cell may refer to any cell whose genome is present in two copies. A diploid cell may refer to a type of cell that is naturally found in a diploid state, or it may refer to a cell that has been induced to exist in a diploid state (e.g., through specific regulation, alteration, inactivation, activation, or modification of meiosis, cytokinesis, or DNA replication). For example, the S. cerevisiae strain S228C may be maintained in a haploid or diploid state. A diploid cell may refer to a cell whose entire genome is diploid, or it may refer to a cell that is diploid in a particular genomic locus of interest. In some embodiments, the fungal cell is a haploid cell. As used herein, a \"haploid\" cell may refer to any cell whose genome is present in one copy. A haploid cell may refer to a type of cell that is naturally found in a haploid state, or it may refer to a cell that has been induced to exist in a haploid state (e.g., through specific regulation, alteration, inactivation, activation, or modification of meiosis, cytokinesis, or DNA replication). For example, the S. cerevisiae strain S228C may be maintained in a haploid or diploid state. A haploid cell may refer to a cell whose entire genome is haploid, or it may refer to a cell that is haploid in a particular genomic locus of interest. As used herein, a \"yeast expression vector\" refers to a nucleic acid that contains one or more sequences encoding an RNA and/or polypeptide and may further contain any desired elements that control the expression of the nucleic acid(s), as well as any elements that enable the replication and maintenance of the expression vector inside the yeast cell. Many suitable yeast expression vectors and features thereof are known in the art; for example, various vectors and techniques are illustrated in in Yeast Protocols, 2nd edition, Xiao, W., ed. (Humana Press, New York, 2007) and Buckholz, R. G. and Gleeson, M. A. (1991) Biotechnology (NY) 9(11): 1067-72. Yeast vectors may contain, without limitation, a centromeric (CEN) sequence, an autonomous replication sequence (ARS), a promoter, such as an RNA Polymerase III promoter, operably linked to a sequence or gene of interest, a terminator such as an RNA polymerase III terminator, an origin of replication, and a marker gene (e.g., auxotrophic, antibiotic, or other selectable markers). Examples of expression vectors for use in yeast may include plasmids, yeast artificial chromosomes, 2 plasmids, yeast integrative plasmids, yeast replicative plasmids, plasmids. integration of Cpf1 CRISPR system components in the genome of plants and plant cells In particular embodiments, it is envisaged that the polynucleotides encoding the components of the Cpf1 CRISPR system are introduced for stable integration into the genome of a plant cell. In these embodiments, the design of the transformation vector or the expression system can be adjusted depending on for when, where and under what conditions the guide RNA and/or the Cpf1 gene are expressed. In particular embodiments, it is envisaged to introduce the components of the Cpf1 CRISPR system stably into the genomic DNA of a plant cell. Additionally or alternatively, it is envisaged to introduce the components of the Cpf1 CRISPR system for stable integration into the DNA of a plant organelle such as, but not limited to a plastid, e mitochondrion or a chloroplast. The expression system for stable integration into the genome of a plant cell may contain one or more of the following elements: a promoter element that can be used to express the RNA and/or Cpf1 enzyme in a plant cell; a 5 untranslated region to enhance expression; an intron element to further enhance expression in certain cells, such as monocot cells; a multiple-cloning site to provide convenient restriction sites for inserting the guide RNA and/or the Cpf1 gene sequences and other desired elements; and a 3 untranslated region to provide for efficient termination of the expressed transcript. The elements of the expression system may be on one or more expression constructs which are either circular such as a plasmid or transformation vector, or non-circular such as linear double stranded DNA. In a particular embodiment, a Cfp1 CRISPR expression system comprises at least: (a) a nucleotide sequence encoding a guide RNA (gRNA) that hybridizes with a target sequence in a plant, and wherein the guide RNA comprises a guide sequence and a direct repeat sequence, and (b) a nucleotide sequence encoding a Cpf1 protein, wherein components (a) or (b) are located on the same or on different constructs, and whereby the different nucleotide sequences can be under control of the same or a different regulatory element operable in a plant cell. DNA construct(s) containing the components of the Cpf1 CRISPR system, and, where applicable, template sequence may be introduced into the genome of a plant, plant part, or plant cell by a variety of conventional techniques. The process generally comprises the steps of selecting a suitable host cell or host tissue, introducing the construct(s) into the host cell or host tissue, and regenerating plant cells or plants therefrom. In particular embodiments, the DNA construct may be introduced into the plant cell using techniques such as but not limited to electroporation, microinjection, aerosol beam injection of plant cell protoplasts, or the DNA constructs can be introduced directly to plant tissue using biolistic methods, such as DNA particle bombardment (see also Fu et al., Transgenic Res. 2000 February; 9(1):11-9). The basis of particle bombardment is the acceleration of particles coated with gene/s of interest toward cells, resulting in the penetration of the protoplasm by the particles and typically stable integration into the genome. (see e.g. Klein et al, Nature (1987), Klein et ah, Bio/Technology (1992), Casas et ah, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1993).). In particular embodiments, the DNA constructs containing components of the Cpf1 CRISPR system may be introduced into the plant by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The DNA constructs may be combined with suitable T-DNA flanking regions and introduced into a conventional Agrobacterium tumefaciens host vector. The foreign DNA can be incorporated into the genome of plants by infecting the plants or by incubating plant protoplasts with Agrobacterium bacteria, containing one or more Ti (tumor-inducing) plasmids. (see e.g. Fraley et al., (1985), Rogers et al., (1987) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,563,055).Plant Promoters In order to ensure appropriate expression in a plant cell, the components of the Cpf1 CRISPR system described herein are typically placed under control of a plant promoter, i.e. a promoter operable in plant cells. The use of different types of promoters is envisaged. A constitutive plant promoter is a promoter that is able to express the open reading frame (ORF) that it controls in all or nearly all of the plant tissues during all or nearly all developmental stages of the plant (referred to as \"constitutive expression\"). One non-limiting example of a constitutive promoter is the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. \"Regulated promoter\" refers to promoters that direct gene expression not constitutively, but in a temporally- and/or spatially-regulated manner, and includes tissue-specific, tissue-preferred and inducible promoters. Different promoters may direct the expression of a gene in different tissues or cell types, or at different stages of development, or in response to different environmental conditions. In particular embodiments, one or more of the Cpf1 CRISPR components are expressed under the control of a constitutive promoter, such as the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter issue-preferred promoters can be utilized to target enhanced expression in certain cell types within a particular plant tissue, for instance vascular cells in leaves or roots or in specific cells of the seed. Examples of particular promoters for use in the Cpf1 CRISPR system are found in Kawamata et al., (1997) Plant Cell Physiol 38:792-803; Yamamoto et al., (1997) Plant J 12:255-65; Hire et al, (1992) Plant Mol Biol 20:207-18, al, (1995) Plant et al., (1994) Plant Mol Biol 25:681-91. Examples of promoters that are inducible and that allow for spatiotemporal control of gene editing or gene expression may use a form of energy. The form of energy may include but is not limited to sound energy, electromagnetic radiation, chemical energy and/or thermal energy. Examples of inducible systems include tetracycline inducible promoters (Tet-On or Tet-Off), small molecule two-hybrid transcription systems (FKBP, ABA, etc), or light inducible systems (Phytochrome, LOV domains, or cryptochrome)., such as a Light Inducible Transcriptional Effector (LITE) that direct changes in transcriptional activity in a sequence-specific manner. The components of a light inducible system may include a Cpf1 transcriptional activation/repression domain. Further examples of inducible DNA binding proteins and methods for their use are provided in U.S. 61/736,465 and U.S. 61/721,283, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In particular embodiments, transient or inducible expression can be achieved by using, for example, chemical-regulated promotors, i.e. whereby the application of an exogenous chemical induces gene expression. Modulating of gene expression can also be obtained by a chemical-repressible promoter, where application of the chemical represses gene expression. Chemical-inducible promoters include, but are not limited to, the maize 1n2-2 promoter, activated by benzene sulfonamide herbicide safeners (De Veylder et al., (1997) Plant Cell Physiol 38:568-77), the maize GST promoter (GST-11-27, WO93/01294), activated by hydrophobic electrophilic compounds used as pre-emergent herbicides, and the tobacco PR-1 a promoter (Ono et al., (2004) Biosci Biotechnol Biochem 68:803-7) activated by salicylic acid. Promoters which are regulated by antibiotics, such as tetracycline-inducible and tetracycline-repressible promoters (Gatz et al., (1991) Mol Gen Genet 227:229-37; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,814,618 and 5,789,156) can also be used herein. Translocation to and/or expression in specific plant organelles The expression system may comprise elements for translocation to and/or expression in a specific plant organelle. Chloroplast Targeting In particular embodiments, it is envisaged that the Cpf1 CRISPR system is used to specifically modify chloroplast genes or to ensure expression in the chloroplast. For this purpose use is made of chloroplast transformation methods or compartmentalization of the Cpf1 CRISPR components to the chloroplast. For instance, the introduction of genetic modifications in the plastid genome can reduce biosafety issues such as gene flow through pollen. Methods of chloroplast transformation are known in the art and include Particle bombardment, PEG treatment, and microinjection. Additionally, methods involving the translocation of transformation cassettes from the nuclear genome to the pastid can be used as described in WO2010061186. Alternatively, it is envisaged to target one or more of the Cpf1 CRISPR components to the plant chloroplast. This is achieved by incorporating in the expression construct a sequence encoding a chloroplast transit peptide (CTP) or plastid transit peptide, operably linked to the 5 region of the sequence encoding the Cpf1 protein. The CTP is removed in a processing step during translocation into the chloroplast. Chloroplast targeting of expressed proteins is well known to the skilled artisan (see for instance Protein Transport into Chloroplasts, 2010, Annual Review of Plant Biology, Vol. 61: 157-180). In such embodiments it is also desired to target the guide RNA to the plant chloroplast. Methods and constructs which can be used for translocating guide RNA into the chloroplast by means of a chloroplast localization sequence are described, for instance, in US 20040142476, incorporated herein by reference. Such variations of constructs can be incorporated into the expression systems of the invention to efficiently translocate the Cpf1-guide RNA.Introduction of Polynucleotides Encoding the CRISPR-Cpf1 System in Algal Cells Transgenic algae (or other plants such as rape) may be particularly useful in the production of vegetable oils or biofuels such as alcohols (especially methanol and ethanol) or other products. These may be engineered to express or overexpress high levels of oil or alcohols for use in the oil or biofuel industries. U.S. Pat. No. 8,945,839 describes a method for engineering Micro-Algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells) species) using Cas9. Using similar tools, the methods of the Cpf1 CRISPR system described herein can be applied on Chlamydomonas species and other algae. In particular embodiments, Cpf1 and guide RNA are introduced in algae expressed using a vector that expresses Cpf1 under the control of a constitutive promoter such as Hsp70A-Rbc S2 or Beta2-tubulin. Guide RNA is optionally delivered using a vector containing T7 promoter. Alternatively, Cpf1 mRNA and in vitro transcribed guide RNA can be delivered to algal cells. Electroporation protocols are available to the skilled person such as the standard recommended protocol from the GeneArt Chlamydomonas Engineering kit. In particular embodiments, the endonuclease used herein is a Split Cpf1 enzyme. Split Cpf1 enzymes are preferentially used in Algae for targeted genome modification as has been described for Cas9 in WO 2015086795. Use of the Cpf1 split system is particularly suitable for an inducible method of genome targeting and avoids the potential toxic effect of the Cpf1 overexpression within the algae cell. In particular embodiments, Said Cpf1 split domains (RuvC and HNH domains) can be simultaneously or sequentially introduced into the cell such that said split Cpf1 domain(s) process the target nucleic acid sequence in the algae cell. The reduced size of the split Cpf1 compared to the wild type Cpf1 allows other methods of delivery of the CRISPR system to the cells, such as the use of Cell Penetrating Peptides as described herein. This method is of particular interest for generating genetically modified algae.Introduction of Polynucleotides Encoding Cpf1 Components in Yeast Cells In particular embodiments, the invention relates to the use of the Cpf1 CRISPR system for genome editing of yeast cells. Methods for transforming yeast cells which can be used to introduce polynucleotides encoding the Cpf1 CRISPR system components are well known to the artisan and are reviewed by Kawai et al., 2010, Bioeng Bugs. 2010 November-December; 1(6): 395-403). Non-limiting examples include transformation of yeast cells by lithium acetate treatment (which may further include carrier DNA and PEG treatment), bombardment or by electroporation. Transient expression of Cpf1 CRISP system components in plants and plant cell In particular embodiments, it is envisaged that the guide RNA and/or Cpf1 gene are transiently expressed in the plant cell. In these embodiments, the Cpf1 CRISPR system can ensure modification of a target gene only when both the guide RNA and the Cpf1 protein is present in a cell, such that genomic modification can further be controlled. As the expression of the Cpf1 enzyme is transient, plants regenerated from such plant cells typically contain no foreign DNA. In particular embodiments the Cpf1 enzyme is stably expressed by the plant cell and the guide sequence is transiently expressed. In particular embodiments, the Cpf1 CRISPR system components can be introduced in the plant cells using a plant viral vector (Scholthof et al. 1996, Annu Rev Phytopathol. 1996; 34:299-323). In further particular embodiments, said viral vector is a vector from a DNA virus. For example, geminivirus (e.g., cabbage leaf curl virus, bean yellow dwarf virus, wheat dwarf virus, tomato leaf curl virus, maize streak virus, tobacco leaf curl virus, or tomato golden mosaic virus) or nanovirus (e.g., Faba bean necrotic yellow virus). In other particular embodiments, said viral vector is a vector from an RNA virus. For example, tobravirus (e.g., tobacco rattle virus, tobacco mosaic virus), potexvirus (e.g., potato virus X), or hordeivirus (e.g., barley stripe mosaic virus). The replicating genomes of plant viruses are non-integrative vectors. In particular embodiments, the vector used for transient expression of Cpf1 CRISPR constructs is for instance a pEAQ vector, which is tailored for Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression (Sainsbury F. et al., Plant Biotechnol J. 2009 September; 7(7):682-93) in the protoplast. Precise targeting of genomic locations was demonstrated using a modified Cabbage Leaf Curl virus (CaLCuV) vector to express gRNAs in stable transgenic plants expressing a CRISPR enzyme (Scientific Reports 5, Article number: 14926 (2015), doi:10.1038/srep14926). In particular embodiments, double-stranded DNA fragments encoding the guide RNA and/or the Cpf1 gene can be transiently introduced into the plant cell. In such embodiments, the introduced double-stranded DNA fragments are provided in sufficient quantity to modify the cell but do not persist after a contemplated period of time has passed or after one or more cell divisions. Methods for direct DNA transfer in plants are known by the skilled artisan (see for instance Davey et al. Plant Mol Biol. 1989 September; 13(3):273-85.) In other embodiments, an RNA polynucleotide encoding the Cpf1protein is introduced into the plant cell, which is then translated and processed by the host cell generating the protein in sufficient quantity to modify the cell (in the presence of at least one guide RNA) but which does not persist after a contemplated period of time has passed or after one or more cell divisions. Methods for introducing mRNA to plant protoplasts for transient expression are known by the skilled artisan (see for instance in Gallie, Plant Cell Reports (1993), 13; 119-122). Combinations of the different methods described above are also envisaged.Delivery of Cpf1 CRISPR Components to the Plant Cell In particular embodiments, it is of interest to deliver one or more components of the Cpf1 CRISPR system directly to the plant cell. This is of interest, inter alia, for the generation of non-transgenic plants (see below). In particular embodiments, one or more of the Cpf1 components is prepared outside the plant or plant cell and delivered to the cell. For instance in particular embodiments, the Cpf1 protein is prepared in vitro prior to introduction to the plant cell. Cpf1 protein can be prepared by various methods known by one of skill in the art and include recombinant production. After expression, the Cpf1 protein is isolated, refolded if needed, purified and optionally treated to remove any purification tags, such as a His-tag. Once crude, partially purified, or more completely purified Cpf1 protein is obtained, the protein may be introduced to the plant cell. In particular embodiments, the Cpf1 protein is mixed with guide RNA targeting the gene of interest to form a pre-assembled ribonucleoprotein. The individual components or pre-assembled ribonucleoprotein can be introduced into the plant cell via electroporation, by bombardment with Cpf1-associated gene product coated particles, by chemical transfection or by some other means of transport across a cell membrane. For instance, transfection of a plant protoplast with a pre-assembled CRISPR ribonucleoprotein has been demonstrated to ensure targeted modification of the plant genome (as described by Woo et al. Nature Biotechnology, 2015; DOI: 10.1038/nbt.3389). In particular embodiments, the Cpf1 CRISPR system components are introduced into the plant cells using nanoparticles. The components, either as protein or nucleic acid or in a combination thereof, can be uploaded onto or packaged in nanoparticles and applied to the plants (such as for instance described in WO 2008042156 and US 20130185823). In particular, embodiments of the invention comprise nanoparticles uploaded with or packed with DNA molecule(s) encoding the Cpf1 protein, DNA molecules encoding the guide RNA and/or isolated guide RNA as described in WO2015089419. Further means of introducing one or more components of the Cpf1 CRISPR system to the plant cell is by using cell penetrating peptides (CPP). Accordingly, in particular, embodiments the invention comprises compositions comprising a cell penetrating peptide linked to the Cpf1 protein. In particular embodiments of the present invention, the Cpf1 protein and/or guide RNA is coupled to one or more CPPs to effectively transport them inside plant protoplasts; see also Ramakrishna (20140 Genome Res. 2014 June; 24(6):1020-7 Cas9 in human cells). In other embodiments, the Cpf1 gene and/or guide RNA are encoded by one or more circular or non-circular DNA molecule(s) which are coupled to one or more CPPs for plant protoplast delivery. The plant protoplasts are then regenerated to plant cells and further to plants. CPPs are generally described as short peptides of fewer than 35 amino acids either derived from proteins or from chimeric sequences which are capable of transporting biomolecules across cell membrane in a receptor independent manner. CPP can be cationic peptides, peptides having hydrophobic sequences, amphipatic peptides, peptides having and or bipartite peptides (Pooga and Langel 2005). CPPs are able to penetrate biological membranes and as such trigger the movement of various biomolecules across cell membranes into the cytoplasm and to improve their intracellular routing, and hence facilitate interaction of the biolomolecule with the target. Examples of CPP include amongst others: Tat, a nuclear transcriptional activator protein may be needed for viral replication by HIV type 1, penetratin, Kaposi fibroblast growth Use of the CPf1 CRISPR system to make genetically modified non-transgenic plants In particular embodiments, the methods described herein are used to modify endogenous genes or to modify their expression without the permanent introduction into the genome of the plant of any foreign gene, including those encoding CRISPR components, so as to avoid the presence of foreign DNA in the genome of the plant. This can be of interest as the regulatory requirements for non-transgenic plants are less rigorous. In particular embodiments, this is ensured by transient expression of the Cpf1 CRISPR components. In particular embodiments one or more of the CRISPR components are expressed on one or more viral vectors which produce sufficient Cpf1 protein and guide RNA to consistently steadily ensure modification of a gene of interest according to a method described herein. In particular embodiments, transient expression of Cpf1 CRISPR constructs is ensured in plant protoplasts and thus not integrated into the genome. The limited window of expression can be sufficient to allow the Cpf1 CRISPR system to ensure modification of a target gene as described herein. In particular embodiments, the different components of the Cpf1 CRISPR system are introduced in the plant cell, protoplast or plant tissue either separately or in mixture, with the aid of pariculate delivering molecules such as nanoparticles or CPP molecules as described herein above. The expression of the Cpf1 CRISPR components can induce targeted modification of the genome, either by direct activity of the Cpf1 nuclease and optionally introduction of template DNA or by modification of genes targeted using the Cpf1 CRISPR system as described herein. The different strategies described herein above allow Cpf1-mediated targeted genome editing without requiring the introduction of the Cpf1 CRISPR components into the plant genome. Components which are transiently introduced into the plant cell are typically removed upon crossing.Detecting Modifications in the Plant Genome\u2014Selectable Markers In particular embodiments, where the method involves modification of an endogenous target gene of the plant genome, any suitable method can be used to determine, after the plant, plant part or plant cell is infected or transfected with the Cpf1 CRISPR system, whether gene targeting or targeted mutagenesis has occurred at the target site. Where the method involves introduction of a transgene, a transformed plant cell, callus, tissue or plant may be identified and isolated by selecting or screening the engineered plant material for the presence of the transgene or for traits encoded by the transgene. Physical and biochemical methods may be used to identify plant or plant cell transformants containing inserted gene constructs or an endogenous DNA modification. These methods include but are not limited to: 1) Southern analysis or PCR amplification for detecting and determining the structure of the recombinant DNA insert or modified endogenous genes; 2) Northern blot, S1 RNase protection, primer-extension or reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification for detecting and examining RNA transcripts of the gene constructs; 3) enzymatic assays for detecting enzyme or ribozyme activity, where such gene products are encoded by the gene construct or expression is affected by the genetic modification; 4) protein gel electrophoresis, Western blot techniques, immunoprecipitation, or enzyme-linked immunoassays, where the gene construct or endogenous gene products are proteins. Additional techniques, such as in situ hybridization, enzyme staining, and immunostaining, also may be used to detect the presence or expression of the recombinant construct or detect a modification of endogenous gene in specific plant organs and tissues. The methods for doing all these assays are well known to those skilled in the art. Additionally (or alternatively), the expression system encoding the Cpf1 CRISPR components is typically designed to comprise one or more selectable or detectable markers that provide a means to isolate or efficiently select cells that contain and/or have been modified by the Cpf1 CRISPR system at an early stage and on a large scale. In the case of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, the marker cassette may be adjacent to or between flanking T-DNA borders and contained within a binary vector. In another embodiment, the marker cassette may be outside of the T-DNA. A selectable marker cassette may also be within or adjacent to the same T-DNA borders as the expression cassette or may be somewhere else within a second T-DNA on the binary vector (e.g., a 2 T-DNA system). For particle bombardment or with protoplast transformation, the expression system can comprise one or more isolated linear fragments or may be part of a larger construct that might contain bacterial replication elements, bacterial selectable markers or other detectable elements. The expression cassette(s) comprising the polynucleotides encoding the guide and/or Cpf1 may be physically linked to a marker cassette or may be mixed with a second nucleic acid molecule encoding a marker cassette. The marker cassette is comprised of necessary elements to express a detectable or selectable marker that allows for efficient selection of transformed cells. The selection procedure for the cells based on the selectable marker will depend on the nature of the marker gene. In particular embodiments, use is made of a selectable marker, i.e. a marker which allows a direct selection of the cells based on the expression of the marker. A selectable marker can confer positive or negative selection and is conditional or non-conditional on the presence of external substrates (Miki et al. 2004, 107(3): 193-232). Most commonly, antibiotic or herbicide resistance genes are used as a marker, whereby selection is be performed by growing the engineered plant material on media containing an inhibitory amount of the antibiotic or herbicide to which the marker gene confers resistance. Examples of such genes are genes that confer resistance to antibiotics, such as hygromycin (hpt) and kanamycin (nptII), and genes that confer resistance to herbicides, such as phosphinothricin (bar) and chlorosulfuron (als), Transformed plants and plant cells may also be identified by screening for the activities of a visible marker, typically an enzyme capable of processing a colored substrate (e.g., the -glucuronidase, luciferase, B or C1 genes). Such selection and screening methodologies are well known to those skilled in the art.Plant Cultures and Regeneration In particular embodiments, plant cells which have a modified genome and that are produced or obtained by any of the methods described herein, can be cultured to regenerate a whole plant which possesses the transformed or modified genotype and thus the desired phenotype. Conventional regeneration techniques are well known to those skilled in the art. Particular examples of such regeneration techniques rely on manipulation of certain phytohormones in a tissue culture growth medium, and typically relying on a biocide and/or herbicide marker which has been introduced together with the desired nucleotide sequences. In further particular embodiments, plant regeneration is obtained from cultured protoplasts, plant callus, explants, organs, pollens, embryos or parts thereof (see e.g. Evans et al. (1983), Handbook of Plant Cell Culture, Klee et al (1987) Ann. Rev. of Plant Phys.). In particular embodiments, transformed or improved plants as described herein can be self-pollinated to provide seed for homozygous improved plants of the invention (homozygous for the DNA modification) or crossed with non-transgenic plants or different improved plants to provide seed for heterozygous plants. Where a recombinant DNA was introduced into the plant cell, the resulting plant of such a crossing is a plant which is heterozygous for the recombinant DNA molecule. Both such homozygous and heterozygous plants obtained by crossing from the improved plants and comprising the genetic modification (which can be a recombinant DNA) are referred to herein as \"progeny\". Progeny plants are plants descended from the original transgenic plant and containing the genome modification or recombinant DNA molecule introduced by the methods provided herein. Alternatively, genetically modified plants can be obtained by one of the methods described supra using the Cfp1 enzyme whereby no foreign DNA is incorporated into the genome. Progeny of such plants, obtained by further breeding may also contain the genetic modification. Breedings are performed by any breeding methods that are commonly used for different crops (e.g., Allard, Principles of Plant Breeding, John Wiley & Sons, NY, U. of CA, Davis, Calif., 50-98 (1960). Generation of Plants with Enhanced Agronomic Traits The Cpf1 based CRISPR systems provided herein can be used to introduce targeted double-strand or single-strand breaks and/or to introduce gene activator and or repressor systems and without being limitative, can be used for gene targeting, gene replacement, targeted mutagenesis, targeted deletions or insertions, targeted inversions and/or targeted translocations. By co-expression of multiple targeting RNAs directed to achieve multiple modifications in a single cell, multiplexed genome modification can be ensured. This technology can be used to high-precision engineering of plants with improved characteristics, including enhanced nutritional quality, increased resistance to diseases and resistance to biotic and abiotic stress, and increased production of commercially valuable plant products or heterologous compounds. In particular embodiments, the Cpf1 CRISPR system as described herein is ued to introduce targeted double-strand breaks (DSB) in an endogenous DNA sequence. The DSB activates cellular DNA repair pathways, which can be harnessed to achieve desired DNA sequence modifications near the break site. This is of interest where the inactivation of endogenous genes can confer or contribute to a desired trait. In particular embodiments, homologous recombination with a template sequence is promoted at the site of the DSB, in order to introduce a gene of interest. In particular embodiments, the Cpf1 CRISPR system may be used as a generic nucleic acid binding protein with fusion to or being operably linked to a functional domain for activation and/or repression of endogenous plant genes. Exemplary functional domains may include but are not limited to translational initiator, light inducible/controllable domain or a chemically inducible/controllable domain. Typically in these embodiments, the Cpf1 protein comprises at least one mutation, such that it has no more than 5% of the activity of the Cpf1 protein not having the at least one mutation; the guide RNA comprises a guide sequence capable of hybridizing to a target sequence. The methods described herein generally result in the generation of \"improved plants\" in that they have one or more desirable traits compared to the wildtype plant. In particular embodiments, the plants, plant cells or plant parts obtained are transgenic plants, comprising an exogenous DNA sequence incorporated into the genome of all or part of the cells of the plant. In particular embodiments, non-transgenic genetically modified plants, plant parts or cells are obtained, in that no exogenous DNA sequence is incorporated into the genome of any of the plant cells of the plant. In such embodiments, the improved plants are non-transgenic. Where only the modification of an endogenous gene is ensured and no foreign genes are introduced or maintained in the plant genome, the resulting genetically modified crops contain no foreign genes and can thus basically be considered non-transgenic. The different applications of the Cpf1 CRISPR system for plant genome editing are described more in detail below:a) Introduction of One or More Foreign Genes to Confer an Agricultural Trait of Interest The invention provides methods of genome editing or modifying sequences associated with or at a target locus of interest wherein the method comprises introducing a Cpf1 effector protein complex into a plant cell, whereby the Cpf1 effector protein complex effectively functions to integrate a DNA insert, e.g. encoding a foreign gene of interest, into the genome of the plant cell. In preferred embodiments the integration of the DNA insert is facilitated by HR with an exogenously introduced DNA template or repair template. Typically, the exogenously introduced DNA template or repair template is delivered together with the Cpf1 effector protein complex or one component or a polynucleotide vector for expression of a component of the complex. The Cpf1 CRISPR systems provided herein allow for targeted gene delivery. It has become increasingly clear that the efficiency of expressing a gene of interest is to a great extent determined by the location of integration into the genome. The present methods allow for targeted integration of the foreign gene into a desired location in the genome. The location can be selected based on information of previously generated events or can be selected by methods disclosed elsewhere herein. In particular embodiments, the methods provided herein include (a) introducing into the cell a Cpf1 CRISPR complex comprising a guide RNA, comprising a direct repeat and a guide sequence, wherein the guide sequence hybridizes to a target sequence that is endogenous to the plant cell; (b) introducing into the plant cell a Cpf1 effector molecule which complexes with the guide RNA when the guide sequence hybridizes to the target sequence and induces a double strand break at or near the sequence to which the guide sequence is targeted; and (c) introducing into the cell a nucleotide sequence encoding an HDR repair template which encodes the gene of interest and which is introduced into the location of the DS break as a result of HDR. In particular embodiments, the step of introducing can include delivering to the plant cell one or more polynucleotides encoding Cpf1 effector protein, the guide RNA and the repair template. In particular embodiments, the polynucleotides are delivered into the cell by a DNA virus (e.g., a geminivirus) or an RNA virus (e.g., a tobravirus). In particular embodiments, the introducing steps include delivering to the plant cell a T-DNA containing one or more polynucleotide sequences encoding the Cpf1 effector protein, the guide RNA and the repair template, where the delivering is via Agrobacterium. The nucleic acid sequence encoding the Cpf1 effector protein can be operably linked to a promoter, such as a constitutive promoter (e.g., a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter), or a cell specific or inducible promoter. In particular embodiments, the polynucleotide is introduced by microprojectile bombardment. In particular embodiments, the method further includes screening the plant cell after the introducing steps to determine whether the repair template i.e. the gene of interest has been introduced. In particular embodiments, the methods include the step of regenerating a plant from the plant cell. In further embodiments, the methods include cross breeding the plant to obtain a genetically desired plant lineage. Examples of foreign genes encoding a trait of interest are listed below. b) Editing of Endogenous Genes to Confer an Agricultural Trait of Interest The invention provides methods of genome editing or modifying sequences associated with or at a target locus of interest wherein the method comprises introducing a Cpf1 effector protein complex into a plant cell, whereby the Cpf1 complex modifies the expression of an endogenous gene of the plant. This can be achieved in different ways, In particular embodiments, the elimination of expression of an endogenous gene is desirable and the Cpf1 CRISPR complex is used to target and cleave an endogenous gene so as to modify gene expression. In these embodiments, the methods provided herein include (a) introducing into the plant cell a Cpf1 CRISPR complex comprising a guide RNA, comprising a direct repeat and a guide sequence, wherein the guide sequence hybridizes to a target sequence within a gene of interest in the genome of the plant cell; and (b) introducing into the cell a Cpf1 effector protein, which upon binding to the guide RNA comprises a guide sequence that is hybridized to the target sequence, ensures a double strand break at or near the sequence to which the guide sequence is targeted; In particular embodiments, the step of introducing can include delivering to the plant cell one or more polynucleotides encoding Cpf1 effector protein and the guide RNA. In particular embodiments, the polynucleotides are delivered into the cell by a DNA virus (e.g., a geminivirus) or an RNA virus (e.g., a tobravirus). In particular embodiments, the introducing steps include delivering to the plant cell a T-DNA containing one or more polynucleotide sequences encoding the Cpf1 effector protein and the guide RNA, where the delivering is via Agrobacterium. The polynucleotide sequence encoding the components of the Cpf1 CRISPR system can be operably linked to a promoter, such as a constitutive promoter (e.g., a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter), or a cell specific or inducible promoter. In particular embodiments, the polynucleotide is introduced by microprojectile bombardment. In particular embodiments, the method further includes screening the plant cell after the introducing steps to determine whether the expression of the gene of interest has been modified. In particular embodiments, the methods include the step of regenerating a plant from the plant cell. In further embodiments, the methods include cross breeding the plant to obtain a genetically desired plant lineage. In particular embodiments of the methods described above, disease resistant crops are obtained by targeted mutation of disease susceptibility genes or genes encoding negative regulators (e.g. Mlo gene) of plant defense genes. In a particular embodiment, herbicide-tolerant crops are generated by targeted substitution of specific nucleotides in plant genes such as those encoding acetolactate synthase (ALS) and protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO). In particular embodiments drought and salt tolerant crops by targeted mutation of genes encoding negative regulators of abiotic stress tolerance, low amylose grains by targeted mutation of Waxy gene, rice or other grains with reduced rancidity by targeted mutation of major lipase genes in aleurone layer, etc. In particular embodiments. A more extensive list of endogenous genes encoding a traits of interest are listed below.c) Modulating of Endogenous Genes by the Cpf1 CRISPR System to Confer an Agricultural Trait of Interest Also provided herein are methods for modulating (i.e. activating or repressing) endogenous gene expression using the Cpf1 protein provided herein. Such methods make use of distinct RNA sequence(s) which are targeted to the plant genome by the Cpf1 complex. More particularly the distinct RNA sequence(s) bind to two or more adaptor proteins (e.g. aptamers) whereby each adaptor protein is associated with one or more functional domains and wherein at least one of the one or more functional domains associated with the adaptor protein have one or more activities comprising methylase activity, demethylase activity, transcription activation activity, transcription repression activity, transcription release factor activity, histone modification activity, DNA integration activity RNA cleavage activity, DNA cleavage activity or nucleic acid binding activity; The functional domains are used to modulate expression of an endogenous plant gene so as to obtain the desired trait. Typically, in these embodiments, the Cpf1 effector protein has one or more mutations such that it has no more than 5% of the nuclease activity of the Cpf1 effector protein not having the at least one mutation. In particular embodiments, the methods provided herein include the steps of (a) introducing into the cell a Cpf1 CRISPR complex comprising a guide RNA, comprising a direct repeat and a guide sequence, wherein the guide sequence hybridizes to a target sequence that is endogenous to the plant cell; (b) introducing into the plant cell a Cpf1 effector molecule which complexes with the guide RNA when the guide sequence hybridizes to the target sequence; and wherein either the guide RNA is modified to comprise a distinct RNA sequence (aptamer) binding to a functional domain and/or the Cpf1 effector protein is modified in that it is linked to a functional domain. In particular embodiments, the step of introducing can include delivering to the plant cell one or more polynucleotides encoding the (modified) Cpf1 effector protein and the (modified) guide RNA. The details the components of the Cpf1 CRISPR system for use in these methods are described elsewhere herein. In particular embodiments, the polynucleotides are delivered into the cell by a DNA virus (e.g., a geminivirus) or an RNA virus (e.g., a tobravirus). In particular embodiments, the introducing steps include delivering to the plant cell a T-DNA containing one or more polynucleotide sequences encoding the Cpf1 effector protein and the guide RNA, where the delivering is via Agrobacterium. The nucleic acid sequence encoding the one or more components of the Cpf1 CRISPR system can be operably linked to a promoter, such as a constitutive promoter (e.g., a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter), or a cell specific or inducible promoter. In particular embodiments, the polynucleotide is introduced by microprojectile bombardment. In particular embodiments, the method further includes screening the plant cell after the introducing steps to determine whether the expression of the gene of interest has been modified. In particular embodiments, the methods include the step of regenerating a plant from the plant cell. In further embodiments, the methods include cross breeding the plant to obtain a genetically desired plant lineage. A more extensive list of endogenous genes encoding a traits of interest are listed below.Use of CPf1 to Modify Polyploid Plants Many plants are polyploid, which means they carry duplicate copies of their genomes-sometimes as many as six, as in wheat. The methods according to the present invention, which make use of the Cpf1 CRISPR effector protein can be \"multiplexed\" to affect all copies of a gene, or to target dozens of genes at once. For instance, in particular embodiments, the methods of the present invention are used to simultaneously ensure a loss of function mutation in different genes responsible for suppressing defenses against a disease. In particular embodiments, the methods of the present invention are used to simultaneously suppress the expression of the TaMLO-A1, TaMLO-B1 and TaMLO-D1 nucleic acid sequence in a wheat plant cell and regenerating a wheat plant therefrom, in order to ensure that the wheat plant is resistant to powdery mildew (see also WO2015109752).Exemplary Genes Conferring Agronomic Traits As described herein above, in particular embodiments, the invention encompasses the use of the Cpf1 CRISPR system as described herein for the insertion of a DNA of interest, including one or more plant expressible gene(s). In further particular embodiments, the invention encompasses methods and tools using the Cpf1 system as described herein for partial or complete deletion of one or more plant expressed gene(s). In other further particular embodiments, the invention encompasses methods and tools using the Cpf1 system as described herein to ensure modification of one or more plant-expressed genes by mutation, substitution, insertion of one of more nucleotides. In other particular embodiments, the invention encompasses the use of Cpf1 CRISPR system as described herein to ensure modification of expression of one or more plant-expressed genes by specific modification of one or more of the regulatory elements directing expression of said genes. In particular embodiments, the invention encompasses methods which involve the introduction of exogenous genes and/or the targeting of endogenous genes and their regulatory elements, such as listed below: 1.

A developmental-arrestive protein produced in nature by a plant. For example, Logemann et al., Bio/Technology 10:305 (1992). In plants, pathogens are often host-specific. For example, some Fusarium species will cause tomato wilt but attacks only tomato, and other Fusarium species attack only wheat. Plants have existing and induced defenses to resist most pathogens. Mutations and recombination events across plant generations lead to genetic variability that gives rise to susceptibility, especially as pathogens reproduce with more frequency than plants. In plants there can be non-host resistance, e.g., the host and pathogen are incompatible or there can be partial resistance against all races of a pathogen, typically controlled by many genes and/or also complete resistance to some races of a pathogen but not to other races. Such resistance is typically controlled by a few genes. Using methods and components of the CRISP-cpf1 system, a new tool now exists to induce specific mutations in anticipation hereon. Accordingly, one can analyze the genome of sources of resistance genes, and in plants having desired characteristics or traits, use the method and components of the Cpf1 CRISPR system to induce the rise of resistance genes. The present systems can do so with more precision than previous mutagenic agents and hence accelerate and improve plant breeding programs. 2.

Nos. 6,284,479, 5,712,107, WO 97/47806, WO 97/47807, WO 97/47808 and WO 00/14249, the production of alpha-1,6 branched alpha-1,4-glucans, as disclosed in WO 00/73422, the production of alternan, as disclosed in e.g. WO 00/47727, WO 00/73422, EP 06077301.7, U.S. Pat. No. 5,908,975 and EP 0728213, the production of hyaluronan, as for example disclosed in WO 2006/032538, WO 2007/039314, WO 2007/039315, WO 2007/039316, JP 2006304779, and WO 2005/012529. Genes that improve drought resistance. For example, WO 2013122472 discloses that the absence or reduced level of functional Ubiquitin Protein Ligase protein (UPL) protein, more specifically, UPL3, leads to a decreased need for water or improved resistance to drought of said plant. Other examples of transgenic plants with increased drought tolerance are disclosed in, for example, US 2009/0144850, US 2007/0266453, and WO 2002/083911. US2009/0144850 describes a plant displaying a drought tolerance phenotype due to altered expression of a DR02 nucleic acid. US 2007/0266453 describes a plant displaying a drought tolerance phenotype due to altered expression of a DR03 nucleic acid and WO 2002/08391 1 describes a plant having an increased tolerance to drought stress due to a reduced activity of an ABC transporter which is expressed in guard cells. Another example is the work by Kasuga and co-authors (1999), who describe that overexpression of cDNA encoding DREB1 A in transgenic plants activated the expression of many stress tolerance genes under normal growing conditions and resulted in improved tolerance to drought, salt loading, and freezing. However, the expression of DREB1A also resulted in severe growth retardation under normal growing conditions (Kasuga (1999) Nat Biotechnol 17(3) 287-291). In further particular embodiments, crop plants can be improved by influencing specific plant traits. For example, by developing pesticide-resistant plants, improving disease resistance in plants, improving plant insect and nematode resistance, improving plant resistance against parasitic weeds, improving plant drought tolerance, improving plant nutritional value, improving plant stress tolerance, avoiding self-pollination, plant forage digestibility biomass, grain yield etc. A few specific non-limiting examples are provided hereinbelow. In addition to targeted mutation of single genes, Cpf1CRISPR complexes can be designed to allow targeted mutation of multiple genes, deletion of chromosomal fragment, site-specific integration of transgene, site-directed mutagenesis in vivo, and precise gene replacement or allele swapping in plants. Therefore, the methods described herein have broad applications in gene discovery and validation, mutational and cisgenic breeding, and hybrid breeding. These applications facilitate the production of a new generation of genetically modified crops with various improved agronomic traits such as herbicide resistance, disease resistance, abiotic stress tolerance, high yield, and superior quality.Use of Cpf1 Gene to Create Male Sterile Plants Hybrid plants typically have advantageous agronomic traits compared to inbred plants. However, for self-pollinating plants, the generation of hybrids can be challenging. In different plant types, genes have been identified which are important for plant fertility, more particularly male fertility. For instance, in maize, at least two genes have been identified which are important in fertility (Amitabh Mohanty International Conference on New Plant Breeding Molecular Technologies Technology Development And Regulation, Oct. 9-10, 2014, Jaipur, India; Svitashev et al. Plant Physiol. et al. Plant J. 2013 December; 76(5):888-99). The methods provided herein can be used to target genes required for male fertility so as to generate male sterile plants which can easily be crossed to generate hybrids. In particular embodiments, the Cpf1 CRISPR system provided herein is used for targeted mutagenesis of the cytochrome P450-like gene (MS26) or the meganuclease gene (MS45) thereby conferring male sterility to the maize plant. Maize plants which are as such genetically altered can be used in hybrid breeding programs.Increasing the Fertility Stage in Plants In particular embodiments, the methods provided herein are used to prolong the fertility stage of a plant such as of a rice plant. For instance, a rice fertility stage gene such as Ehd3 can be targeted in order to generate a mutation in the gene and plantlets can be selected for a prolonged regeneration plant fertility stage (as described in CN 104004782)Use of CPf1 to Generate Genetic Variation in a Crop of Interest The availability of wild germplasm and genetic variations in crop plants is the key to crop improvement programs, but the available diversity in germplasms from crop plants is limited. The present invention envisages methods for generating a diversity of genetic variations in a germplasm of interest. In this application of the Cpf1 CRISPR system a library of guide RNAs targeting different locations in the plant genome is provided and is introduced into plant cells together with the Cpf1 effector protein. In this way a collection of genome-scale point mutations and gene knock-outs can be generated. In particular embodiments, the methods comprise generating a plant part or plant from the cells so obtained and screening the cells for a trait of interest. The target genes can include both coding and non-coding regions. In particular embodiments, the trait is stress tolerance and the method is a method for the generation of stress-tolerant crop varieties Use of CPf1 to affect fruit-ripening Ripening is a normal phase in the maturation process of fruits and vegetables. Only a few days after it starts it renders a fruit or vegetable inedible. This process brings significant losses to both farmers and consumers. In particular embodiments, the methods of the present invention are used to reduce ethylene production. This is ensured by ensuring one or more of the following: a. Suppression of ACC synthase gene expression. ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) synthase is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to ACC; the second to the last step in ethylene biosynthesis. Enzyme expression is hindered when an antisense (\"mirror-image\") or truncated copy of the synthase gene is inserted into the plant's genome; b. Insertion of the ACC deaminase gene. The gene coding for the enzyme is obtained from Pseudomonas chlororaphis, a common nonpathogenic soil bacterium. It converts ACC to a different compound thereby reducing the amount of ACC available for ethylene production; c. Insertion of the SAM hydrolase gene. This approach is similar to ACC deaminase wherein ethylene production is hindered when the amount of its precursor metabolite is reduced; in this case SAM is converted to homoserine. The gene coding for the enzyme is obtained from E. coli T3 bacteriophage and d. Suppression of ACC oxidase gene expression. ACC oxidase is the enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of ACC to ethylene, the last step in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway. Using the methods described herein, down regulation of the ACC oxidase gene results in the suppression of ethylene production, thereby delaying fruit ripening. In particular embodiments, additionally or alternatively to the modifications described above, the methods described herein are used to modify ethylene receptors, so as to interfere with ethylene signals obtained by the fruit. In particular embodiments, expression of the ETR1 gene, encoding an ethylene binding protein is modified, more particularly suppressed. In particular embodiments, additionally or alternatively to the modifications described above, the methods described herein are used to modify expression of the gene encoding Polygalacturonase (PG), which is the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of pectin, the substance that maintains the integrity of plant cell walls. Pectin breakdown occurs at the start of the ripening process resulting in the softening of the fruit. Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the methods described herein are used to introduce a mutation in the PG gene or to suppress activation of the PG gene in order to reduce the amount of PG enzyme produced thereby delaying pectin degradation. Thus in particular embodiments, the methods comprise the use of the Cpf1 CRISPR system to ensure one or more modifications of the genome of a plant cell such as described above, and regenerating a plant therefrom. In particular embodiments, the plant is a tomato plant.Increasing Storage Life of Plants In particular embodiments, the methods of the present invention are used to modify genes involved in the production of compounds which affect storage life of the plant or plant part. More particularly, the modification is in a gene that prevents the accumulation of reducing sugars in potato tubers. Upon high-temperature processing, these reducing sugars react with free amino acids, resulting in brown, bitter-tasting products and elevated levels of acrylamide, which is a potential carcinogen. In particular embodiments, the methods provided herein are used to reduce or inhibit expression of the vacuolar invertase gene (VInv), which encodes a protein that breaks down sucrose to glucose and fructose (Clasen et al. DOI: 10.1111/pbi.12370).The Use of the Cpf1 CRISPR System to Ensure a Value Added Trait In particular embodiments the Cpf1 CRISPR system is used to produce nutritionally improved agricultural crops. In particular embodiments, the methods provided herein are adapted to generate \"functional foods\", i.e. a modified food or food ingredient that may provide a health benefit beyond the traditional nutrients it contains and or \"nutraceutical\", i.e. substances that may be considered a food or part of a food and provides health benefits, including the prevention and treatment of disease. In particular embodiments, the nutraceutical is useful in the prevention and/or treatment of one or more of cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. Examples of nutritionally improved crops include (Newell-McGloughlin, Plant Physiology, July 2008, Vol. 147, pp. 939-953): modified protein quality, content and/or amino acid composition, such as have been described for Bahiagrass (Luciani et al. 2005, Florida Genetics Conference Poster), Canola (Roesler et al., 1997, Plant Physiol 113 75-81), Maize (Cromwell et al, 1967, 1969 J Anim Sci 26 1325-1331, O'Quin et al. 2000 J Anim Sci 78 2144-2149, Yang et al. 2002, Transgenic Res 11 11-20, Young et al. 2004, Plant J 38 910-922), Potato (Yu J and Ao, 1997 Acta Bot Sin 39 329-334; Chakraborty et al. 2000, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97 3724-3729; Li et al. 2001) Chin Sci Bull 46 482-484, Rice (Katsube et al. 1999, Plant Physiol 120 1063-1074), Soybean (Dinkins et al. 2001, Rapp 2002, In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Plant 37 742-747), Sweet Potato (Egnin and Prakash 1997, In Vitro Cell Dev Biol 33 52A).

In particular embodiments, the value-added trait is related to the envisaged health benefits of the compounds present in the plant. For instance, in particular embodiments, the value-added crop is obtained by applying the methods of the invention to ensure the modification of or induce/increase the synthesis of one or more of the following compounds: Carotenoids, such as -Carotene present in carrots which Neutralizes free radicals that may cause damage to cells or -Carotene present in various fruits and vegetables which neutralizes free radicals Lutein present in green vegetables which contributes to maintenance of healthy vision Lycopene present in tomato and tomato products, which is believed to reduce the risk of prostate cancer Zeaxanthin, present in citrus and maize, which contributes to mainteance of healthy vision Dietary fiber such as insoluble fiber present in wheat bran which may reduce the risk of breast and/or colon cancer and -Glucan present in oat, soluble fiber present in Psylium and whole cereal grains which may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) Fatty acids, such as -3 fatty acids which may reduce the risk of CVD and improve mental and visual functions, Conjugated linoleic acid, which may improve body composition, may decrease risk of certain cancers and GLA which may reduce inflammation risk of cancer and CVD, may improve body composition Flavonoids such as Hydroxycinnamates, present in wheat which have Antioxidant-like activities, may reduce risk of degenerative diseases, flavonols, catechins and tannins present in fruits and vegetables which neutralize free radicals and may reduce risk of cancer Glucosinolates, indoles, isothiocyanates, such as Sulforaphane, present in Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, kale), horseradish, which neutralize free radicals, may reduce risk of cancer Phenolics, such as stilbenes present in grape which May reduce risk of degenerative diseases, heart disease, and cancer, may have longevity effect and caffeic acid and ferulic acid present in vegetables and citrus which have Antioxidant-like activities, may reduce risk of degenerative diseases, heart disease, and eye disease, and epicatechin present in cacao which has Antioxidant-like activities, may reduce risk of degenerative diseases and heart disease Plant stanols/sterols present in maize, soy, wheat and wooden oils which May reduce risk of coronary heart disease by lowering blood cholesterol levels Fructans, inulins, fructo-oligosaccharides present in Jerusalem artichoke, shallot, onion powder which may improve gastrointestinal health Saponins present in soybean, which may lower LDL cholesterol Soybean protein present in soybean which may reduce risk of heart disease Phytoestrogens such as isoflavones present in soybean which May reduce menopause symptoms, such as hot flashes, may reduce osteoporosis and CVD and lignans present in flax, rye and vegetables, which May protect against heart disease and some cancers, may lower LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol. Sulfides and thiols such as diallyl sulphide present in onion, garlic, olive, leek and scallon and Allyl methyl trisulfide, dithiolthiones present in cruciferous vegetables which may lower LDL cholesterol, helps to maintain healthy immune system Tannins, such as proanthocyanidins, present in cranberry, cocoa, which may improve urinary tract health, may reduce risk of CVD and high blood pressure. In addition, the methods of the present invention also envisage modifying protein/starch functionality, shelf life, taste/aesthetics, fiber quality, and allergen, antinutrient, and toxin reduction traits. Accordingly, the invention encompasses methods for producing plants with nutritional added value, said methods comprising introducing into a plant cell a gene encoding an enzyme involved in the production of a component of added nutritional value using the Cpf1 CRISPR system as described herein and regenerating a plant from said plant cell, said plant characterized in an increase expression of said component of added nutritional value. In particular embodiments, the Cpf1 CRISPR system is used to modify the endogenous synthesis of these compounds indirectly, e.g. by modifying one or more transcription factors that controls the metabolism of this compound. Methods for introducing a gene of interest into a plant cell and/or modifying an endogenous gene using the Cpf1 CRISPR system are described herein above. Some specific examples of modifications in plants that have been modified to confer value-added traits are: plants with modified fatty acid metabolism, for example, by transforming a plant with an antisense gene of stearyl-ACP desaturase to increase stearic acid content of the plant. See Knultzon et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89:2624 (1992). Another example involves decreasing phytate content, for example by cloning and then reintroducing DNA associated with the single allele which may be responsible for maize mutants characterized by low levels of phytic acid. See Raboy et al, Maydica 35:383 (1990). Similarly, expression of the maize (Zea mays) Tfs C1 and R, which regulate the production of flavonoids in maize aleurone layers under the control of a strong promoter, resulted in a high accumulation rate of anthocyanins in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), presumably by activating the entire pathway (Bruce et al., 2000, Plant Cell 12:65-80). DellaPenna (Welsch et al., 2007 found that Tf its interacting increased carotenogenesis in Arabidopsis leaves. Expressing the Tf Dof1 induced the up-regulation of genes encoding enzymes for carbon skeleton production, a marked increase of amino acid content, and a reduction of the Glc level in transgenic Arabidopsis (Yanagisawa, 2004 (Skirycz et al., 2006 Plant J 47: 10-24).Reducing Allergen in Plants In particular embodiments the methods provided herein are used to generate plants with a reduced level of allergens, making them safer for the consumer. In particular embodiments, the methods comprise modifying expression of one or more genes responsible for the production of plant allergens. For instance, in particular embodiments, the methods comprise down-regulating expression of a Lol p5 gene in a plant cell, such as a ryegrass plant cell and regenerating a plant therefrom so as to reduce allergenicity of the pollen of said plant (Bhalla et al. 1999, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 96: 11676-11680). Peanut allergies and allergies to legumes generally are a real and serious health concern. The Cpf1 effector protein system of the present invention can be used to identify and then edit or silence genes encoding allergenic proteins of such legumes. Without limitation as to such genes and proteins, Nicolaou et al. identifies allergenic proteins in peanuts, soybeans, lentils, peas, lupin, green beans, and mung beans. See, Nicolaou et al., Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology 2011; 11(3):222).Screening Methods for Endogenous Genes of Interest The methods provided herein further allow the identification of genes of value encoding enzymes involved in the production of a component of added nutritional value or generally genes affecting agronomic traits of interest, across species, phyla, and plant kingdom. By selectively targeting e.g. genes encoding enzymes of metabolic pathways in plants using the Cpf1 CRISPR system as described herein, the genes responsible for certain nutritional aspects of a plant can be identified. Similarly, by selectively targeting genes which may affect a desirable agronomic trait, the relevant genes can be identified. Accordingly, the present invention encompasses screening methods for genes encoding enzymes involved in the production of compounds with a particular nutritional value and/or agronomic traits.Use of Cpf1 CRISPR System in Biofuel Production The term \"biofuel\" as used herein is an alternative fuel made from plant and plant-derived resources. Renewable biofuels can be extracted from organic matter whose energy has been obtained through a process of carbon fixation or are made through the use or conversion of biomass. This biomass can be used directly for biofuels or can be converted to convenient energy containing substances by thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in solid, liquid, or gas form. There are two types of biofuels: bioethanol and biodiesel. Bioethanol is mainly produced by the sugar fermentation process of cellulose (starch), which is mostly derived from maize and sugar cane. Biodiesel on the other hand is mainly produced from oil crops such as rapeseed, palm, and soybean. Biofuels are used mainly for transportation.Enhancing Plant Properties for Biofuel Production In particular embodiments, the methods using the Cpf1 CRISPR system as described herein are used to alter the properties of the cell wall in order to facilitate access by key hydrolysing agents for a more efficient release of sugars for fermentation. In particular embodiments, the biosynthesis of cellulose and/or lignin are modified. Cellulose is the major component of the cell wall. The biosynthesis of cellulose and lignin are co-regulated. By reducing the proportion of lignin in a plant the proportion of cellulose can be increased. In particular embodiments, the methods described herein are used to downregulate lignin biosynthesis in the plant so as to increase fermentable carbohydrates. More particularly, the methods described herein are used to downregulate at least a first lignin biosynthesis gene selected from the group A2. In particular embodiments, the methods described herein are used to produce plant mass that produces lower levels of acetic acid during fermentation (see also WO 2010096488). More particularly, the methods disclosed herein are used to generate mutations in homologs to CaslL to reduce polysaccharide acetylation. Modifying particular Cpf1 enzyme provided herein is used for bioethanol production by recombinant micro-organisms. For instance, Cpf1 can be used to engineer micro-organisms, such as yeast, to generate biofuel or biopolymers from fermentable sugars and optionally to be able to degrade plant-derived lignocellulose derived from agricultural waste as a source of fermentable sugars. More particularly, the invention provides methods whereby the Cpf1 CRISPR complex is used to introduce foreign genes required for biofuel production into micro-organisms and/or to modify endogenous genes why may interfere with the biofuel synthesis. More particularly the methods involve introducing into a micro-organism such as a yeast one or more nucleotide sequence encoding enzymes involved in the conversion of pyruvate to ethanol or another product of interest. In particular embodiments the methods ensure the introduction of one or more enzymes which allows the micro-organism to degrade cellulose, such as a cellulase. In yet further embodiments, the Cpf1 CRISPR complex is used to modify endogenous metabolic pathways which compete with the biofuel production pathway. Accordingly, in more particular embodiments, the methods described herein are used to modify a micro-organism as follows: to introduce at least one heterologous nucleic acid or increase expression of at least one endogenous nucleic acid encoding a plant cell wall degrading enzyme, such that said micro-organism is capable of expressing said nucleic acid and of producing and secreting said plant cell wall degrading enzyme; to introduce at least one heterologous nucleic acid or increase expression of at least one endogenous nucleic acid encoding an enzyme that converts pyruvate to acetaldehyde optionally combined with at least one heterologous nucleic acid encoding an enzyme that converts acetaldehyde to ethanol such that said host cell is capable of expressing said nucleic acid; and/or to modify at least one nucleic acid encoding for an enzyme in a metabolic pathway in said host cell, wherein said pathway produces a metabolite other than acetaldehyde from pyruvate or ethanol from acetaldehyde, and wherein said modification results in a reduced production of said metabolite, or to introduce at least one nucleic acid encoding for an inhibitor of said enzyme.Modifying Algae and Plants for Production of Vegetable Oils or Biofuels Transgenic algae or other plants such as rape may be particularly useful in the production of vegetable oils or biofuels such as alcohols (especially methanol and ethanol), for instance. These may be engineered to express or overexpress high levels of oil or alcohols for use in the oil or biofuel industries. According to particular embodiments of the invention, the Cpf1 CRISPR system is used to generate lipid-rich diatoms which are useful in biofuel production. In particular embodiments it is envisaged to specifically modify genes that are involved in the modification of the quantity of lipids and/or the quality of the lipids produced by the algal cell. Examples of genes encoding enzymes involved in the pathways of fatty acid synthesis can encode proteins having for instance acetyl-CoA malic enzyme activities. In further embodiments it is envisaged to generate diatoms that have increased lipid accumulation. This can be achieved by targeting genes that decrease lipid catabolisation. Of particular interest for use in the methods of the present invention are genes involved in the activation of both triacylglycerol and free fatty acids, as well as genes directly involved in 3-oxidation of fatty acids, such system and methods described herein can be used to specifically activate such genes in diatoms as to increase their lipid content. Organisms such as microalgae are widely used for synthetic biology. Stovicek et al. (Metab. Eng. Comm., 2015; 2:13 describes genome editing of industrial yeast, for example, Saccharomyces cerevisae, to efficiently produce robust strains for industrial production. Stovicek used a CRISPR-Cas9 system codon-optimized for yeast to simultaneously disrupt both alleles of an endogenous gene and knock in a heterologous gene. Cas9 and gRNA were expressed from genomic or episomal 2-based vector locations. The authors also showed that gene disruption efficiency could be improved by optimization of the levels of Cas9 and gRNA expression. Hlavovi et al. (Biotechnol. Adv. 2015) discusses development of species or strains of microalgae using techniques such as CRISPR to target nuclear and chloroplast genes for insertional mutagenesis and screening. The methods of Stovicek and Hlavovi may be applied to the Cpf1 effector protein system of the present invention. U.S. Pat. No. 8,945,839 describes a method for engineering Micro-Algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells) species) using Cas9. Using similar tools, the methods of the Cpf1 CRISPR system described herein can be applied on Chlamydomonas species and other algae. In particular embodiments, Cpf1 and guide RNA are introduced in algae expressed using a vector that expresses Cpf1 under the control of a constitutive promoter such as Hsp70A-Rbc S2 or Beta2-tubulin. Guide RNA will be delivered using a vector containing T7 promoter. Alternatively, Cpf1 mRNA and in vitro transcribed guide RNA can be delivered to algal cells. Electroporation protocol follows standard recommended protocol from the GeneArt Chlamydomonas Engineering kit.The Use of Cpf1 in the Generation of Micro-Organisms Capable of Fatty Acid Production In particular embodiments, the methods of the invention are used for the generation of genetically engineered micro-organisms capable of the production of fatty esters, such as acid ethyl esters (\"FAEE\"), Typically, host cells can be engineered to produce fatty esters from a carbon source, such as an alcohol, present in the medium, by expression or overexpression of a gene encoding a thioesterase, a gene encoding an acyl-CoA synthase, and a gene encoding an ester synthase. Accordingly, the methods provided herein are used to modify a micro-organisms so as to overexpress or introduce a thioesterase gene, a gene encloding an acyl-CoA synthase, and a gene encoding an ester synthase.

In particular embodiments, the micro-organism is selected from the in the Generation of Micro-Organisms Capable of Organic Acid Production The methods provided herein are further used to engineer micro-organisms capable of organic acid production, more particularly from pentose or hexose sugars. In particular embodiments, the methods comprise introducing into a micro-organism an exogenous LDH gene. In particular embodiments, the organic acid production in said micro-organisms is additionally or alternatively increased by inactivating endogenous genes encoding proteins involved in an endogenous metabolic pathway which produces a metabolite other than the organic acid of interest and/or wherein the endogenous metabolic pathway consumes the organic acid.

Error-prone PCR can be used to amplify one (or more) genes involved in the xylose utilization or cellobiose utilization pathways. Examples of genes involved in xylose utilization pathways and cellobiose utilization pathways may include, without limitation, those described in Ha, S. J., et al. (2011) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 108(2):504-9 and Galazka, J. M., et al. (2010) Science 330(6000):84-6. Resulting libraries of double-stranded DNA molecules, each comprising a random mutation in such a selected gene could be co-transformed with the components of the Cpf1 CRISPR system into a yeast strain (for instance S288C) and strains can be selected with enhanced xylose or cellobiose utilization capacity, as described in WO2015138855.The Use of Cpf1 in the Generation of Improved Yeasts Strains for Use in Isoprenoid Biosynthesis Tadas Jakoiunas et al. described the successful application of a multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 system for genome engineering of up to 5 different genomic loci in one transformation step in baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Metabolic Engineering Volume 28, March 2015, Pages 213-222) resulting in strains with high mevalonate production, a key intermediate for the industrially important isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway. In particular embodiments, the Cpf1 CRISPR system may be applied in a multiplex genome engineering method as described herein for identifying additional high producing yeast strains for use in isoprenoid synthesis.The Use of Cpf1 in the Generation of Lactic Acid Producing Yeasts Strains In another embodiment, successful application of a multiplex Cpf1 CRISPR system is encompassed. In analogy with Vratislav Stovicek et al. (Metabolic Engineering Communications, Volume 2, December 2015, Pages 13-22), improved lactic acid-producing strains can be designed and obtained in a single transformation event. In a particular embodiment, the Cpf1 CRISPR system is used for simultaneously inserting the heterologous lactate dehydrogenase gene and disruption of two endogenous and PDC5 genes.Further Applications of the Cpf1 CRISPR System in Plants In particular embodiments, the CRISPR system, and preferably the Cpf1 CRISPR system described herein, can be used for visualization of genetic element dynamics. For example, CRISPR imaging can visualize either repetitive or non-repetitive genomic sequences, report telomere length change and telomere movements and monitor the dynamics of gene loci throughout the cell cycle (Chen et al., Cell, 2013). These methods may also be applied to plants. Other applications of the CRISPR system, and preferably the Cpf1 CRISPR system described herein, is the targeted gene disruption positive-selection screening in vitro and in vivo (Malina et al., Genes and Development, 2013). These methods may also be applied to plants. In particular embodiments, fusion of inactive Cpf1 endonucleases with histone-modifying enzymes can introduce custom changes in the complex epigenome (Rusk et al., Nature Methods, 2014). These methods may also be applied to plants. In particular embodiments, the CRISPR system, and preferably the Cpf1 CRISPR system described herein, can be used to purify a specific portion of the chromatin and identify the associated proteins, thus elucidating their regulatory roles in transcription (Waldrip et al., Epigenetics, 2014). These methods may also be applied to plants. In particular embodiments, present invention can be used as a therapy for virus removal in plant systems as it is able to cleave both viral DNA and RNA. Previous studies in human systems have demonstrated the success of utilizing CRISPR in targeting the single strand RNA virus, hepatitis C (A. Price, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, 2015) as well as the double stranded DNA virus, hepatitis B (V. Ramanan, et al., Sci. Rep, 2015). These methods may also be adapted for using the Cpf1 CRISPR system in plants. In particular embodiments, present invention could be used to alter genome complexicity. In further particular embodiment, the CRISPR system, and preferably the Cpf1 CRISPR system described herein, can be used to disrupt or alter chromosome number and generate haploid plants, which only contain chromosomes from one parent. Such plants can be induced to undergo chromosome duplication and converted into diploid plants containing only homozygous alleles (Karimi-Ashtiyani et al., PNAS, 2015; Anton et al., Nucleus, 2014). These methods may also be applied to plants. In particular embodiments, the Cpf1 CRISPR system described herein, can be used for self-cleavage. In these embodiments, the promotor of the Cpf1 enzyme and gRNA can be a constitutive promotor and a second gRNA is introduced in the same transformation cassette, but controlled by an inducible promoter. This second gRNA can be designated to induce site-specific cleavage in the Cpf1 gene in order to create a non-functional Cpf1. In a further particular embodiment, the second gRNA induces cleavage on both ends of the transformation cassette, resulting in the removal of the cassette from the host genome. This system offers a controlled duration of cellular exposure to the Cas enzyme and further minimizes off-target editing. Furthermore, cleavage of both ends of a CRISPR/Cas cassette can be used to generate transgene-free TO plants with bi-allelic mutations (as described for Cas9 e.g. Moore et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2014; Schaeffer et al., Plant Science, 2015). The methods of Moore et al. may be applied to the Cpf1 CRISPR systems described herein. Sugano March; 55(3):475-81. doi: 10.1093/pcp/pcu014. Epub 2014 Jan. 18) reports the CRISPR-Cas9 to targeted mutagenesis in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha L., which has emerged as a model species for studying land plant evolution. The U6 promoter of M. polymorpha was identified and cloned to express the gRNA. The target sequence of the gRNA was designed to disrupt the gene encoding auxin response factor 1 (ARF1) in M. polymorpha. Using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, Sugano et al. isolated stable mutants the generation of M. polymorpha. CRISPR-Cas9-based site-directed mutagenesis in vivo was achieved using Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S or M. polymorpha EF1 promoter to express Cas9. Isolated mutant individuals showing an auxin-resistant phenotype were not chimeric. Moreover, stable mutants were produced by asexual reproduction of T1 plants. Multiple arf1 alleles were easily established using CRIPSR-Cas9-based targeted mutagenesis. The methods of Sugano et al. may be applied to the Cpf1 effector protein system of the present invention. Kabadi et al. (Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Oct. 29; 42(19):e147. doi: 10.1093/nar/gku749. Epub 2014 Aug. 13) developed a single lentiviral system to express a Cas9 variant, a reporter gene and up to four sgRNAs from independent RNA polymerase III promoters that are incorporated into the vector by a convenient Golden Gate cloning method. Each sgRNA was efficiently expressed and can mediate multiplex gene editing and sustained transcriptional activation in immortalized and primary human cells. The methods of Kabadi et al. may be applied to the Cpf1 effector protein system of the present invention. Ling et al. (BMC Plant Biology 2014, 14:327) developed a CRISPR-Cas9 binary vector set based on the pGreen or pCAMBIA backbone, as well as a gRNA This toolkit requires no restriction enzymes besides BsaI to generate final constructs harboring maize-codon optimized Cas9 and one or more gRNAs with high efficiency in as little as one cloning step. The toolkit was validated using maize protoplasts, transgenic maize lines, and transgenic Arabidopsis lines and was shown to exhibit high efficiency and specificity. More importantly, using this toolkit, targeted mutations of three Arabidopsis genes were detected in transgenic seedlings of the TI generation. Moreover, the multiple-gene mutations could be inherited by the next generation. (guide RNA)module vector set, as a toolkit for multiplex genome editing in plants. The toolbox of Lin et al. may be applied to the Cpf1 effector protein system of the present invention. Protocols for targeted plant genome editing via CRISPR-Cpf1 are also available based on those disclosed for the CRISPR-Cas9 system in volume 1284 of the series Methods in Molecular Biology pp 239-255 10 Feb. 2015. A detailed procedure to design, construct, and evaluate dual gRNAs for plant codon optimized Cas9 Nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts s model cellular systems are described. Strategies to apply the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generating targeted genome modifications in whole plants are also discussed. The protocols described in the chapter may be applied to the Cpf1 effector protein system of the present invention. Ma et al. (Mol Plant. 2015 Aug. 3; 8(8):1274-84. doi: 10.1016/j.molp.2015.04.007) reports robust CRISPR-Cas9 vector system, utilizing a plant codon optimized Cas9 gene, for convenient and high-efficiency multiplex genome editing in monocot and dicot plants. Ma et al. designed PCR-based procedures to rapidly generate multiple sgRNA expression cassettes, which can be assembled into the binary CRISPR-Cas9 vectors in one round of cloning by Golden Gate ligation or Gibson Assembly. With this system, Ma et al. edited 46 target sites in rice with an average 85.4% rate of mutation, mostly in biallelic and homozygous status. Ma et al. provide examples of loss-of-function gene mutations in TO rice and T1Arabidopsis plants by simultaneous targeting of multiple (up to eight) members of a gene family, multiple genes in a biosynthetic pathway, or multiple sites in a single gene. The methods of Ma et al. may be applied to the Cpf1 effector protein system of the present invention. Lowder et al. (Plant Physiol. 2015 Aug. 21. pii: pp. 00636.2015) also developed a CRISPR-Cas9 toolbox enables multiplex genome editing and transcriptional regulation of expressed, silenced or non-coding genes in plants. This toolbox provides researchers with a protocol and reagents to quickly and efficiently assemble functional CRISPR-Cas9 T-DNA constructs for monocots and dicots using Golden Gate and Gateway cloning methods. It comes with a full suite of capabilities, including multiplexed gene editing and transcriptional activation or repression of plant endogenous genes. T-DNA based transformation technology is fundamental to modern plant biotechnology, genetics, molecular biology and physiology. As such, Applicants developed a method for the assembly of Cpf1 (WT, nickase or dCpf1) and gRNA(s) into a T-DNA destination-vector of interest. The assembly method is based on both Golden Gate assembly and MultiSite Gateway recombination. Three modules may be needed for assembly. The first module is a Cpf1 entry vector, which contains promoterless Cpf1 or its derivative genes flanked by attL1 and attR5 sites. The second module is a gRNA entry vector which contains entry gRNA expression cassettes flanked by attL5 and attL2 sites. The third module includes attR1-attR2-containing destination T-DNA vectors that provide promoters of choice for Cpf1 expression. The toolbox of Lowder et al. may be applied to the Cpf1 effector protein system of the present invention. Wang et al. (bioRxiv 051342; doi: doi.org/10.1101/051342; Epub. May 12, 2016) demonstrate editing of homoeologous copies of four genes affecting important agronomic traits in hexaploid wheat using a multiplexed gene editing construct with several gRNA-tRNA units under the control of a single promoter. In an advantageous embodiment, the plant may be a tree. The present invention may also utilize the herein disclosed CRISPR Cas system for herbaceous systems (see, e.g., Belhaj et al., Plant Methods 9: 39 and Harrison et al., Genes & Development 28: 1859-1872). In a particularly advantageous embodiment, the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention may target single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in trees (see, e.g., Zhou et al., New Phytologist, Volume 208, Issue 2, pages 298-301, October 2015). In the Zhou et al. study, the authors applied a CRISPR Cas system in the woody perennial Populus using the 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL) gene family as a case study and achieved 100% mutational efficiency for two 4CL genes targeted, with every transformant examined carrying biallelic modifications. In the Zhou et al., study, the CRISPR-Cas9 system was highly sensitive to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as cleavage for a third 4CL gene was abolished due to SNPs in the target sequence. These methods may be applied to the Cpf1 effector protein system of the present invention. The methods of Zhou et al. (New Phytologist, Volume 208, Issue 2, pages 298-301, October 2015) may be applied to the present invention as follows. Two 4CL genes, 4CL1 and 4CL2, associated with lignin and flavonoid CRISPR-Cas9 editing. The Populus tremula\u00d7alba clone 717-1B4 routinely used for transformation is divergent genome-sequenced Populus trichocarpa. Therefore, the 4CL1 and 4CL2 gRNAs reference genome are interrogated with in-house 717 RNA-Seq data to ensure the absence of SNPs which could limit Cas efficiency. A third gRNA designed for 4CL5, a genome duplicate of 4CL1, is also included. The corresponding 717 sequence harbors one SNP in each allele near/within the PAM, both of which are expected to abolish targeting by the 4CL5-gRNA. All three gRNA target sites are located within the first exon. For 717 transformation, the gRNA is expressed from the Medicago U6.6 promoter, along with a human codon-optimized Cas under control of the CaMV 35S promoter in a binary vector. Transformation with the Cas-only vector can serve as a control. Randomly selected 4CL1 and 4CL2 lines are subjected to amplicon-sequencing. The data is then processed and biallelic mutations are confirmed in all cases. These methods may be applied to the Cpf1 effector protein system of the present invention. In plants, pathogens are often host-specific. For example, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici causes tomato wilt but tomato, and F. oxysporum f. dianthii Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici attacks only wheat. Plants have existing and induced defenses to resist most pathogens. Mutations and recombination events across plant generations lead to genetic variability that gives rise to susceptibility, especially as pathogens reproduce with more frequency than plants. In plants there can be non-host resistance, e.g., the host and pathogen are incompatible. There can also be Horizontal Resistance, e.g., partial resistance against all races of a pathogen, typically controlled by many genes and Vertical Resistance, e.g., complete resistance to some races of a pathogen but not to other races, typically controlled by a few genes. In a Gene-for-Gene level, plants and pathogens evolve together, and the genetic changes in one balance changes in other. Accordingly, using Natural Variability, breeders combine useful genes for Yield, Quality, Uniformity, Hardiness, Resistance. The sources of resistance genes include native or foreign Varieties, Heirloom Varieties, Wild Plant Relatives, and Induced Mutations, e.g., treating plant material with mutagenic agents. Using the present invention, plant breeders are provided with a new tool to induce mutations. Accordingly, one skilled in the art can analyze the genome of sources of resistance genes, and in Varieties having desired characteristics or traits employ the present invention to induce the rise of resistance genes, with more precision than previous mutagenic agents and hence accelerate and improve plant breeding programs. The following table provides additional references and related fields for which the CRISPR-Cas complexes, modified effector proteins, systems, and methods of optimization may be used to improve bioproduction. The present invention also provides plants and yeast cells obtainable and obtained by the methods provided herein. The improved plants obtained by the methods described herein may be useful in food or feed production through expression of genes which, for instance ensure tolerance to plant pests, herbicides, drought, low or high temperatures, excessive water, etc. The improved plants obtained by the methods described herein, especially crops and algae may be useful in food or feed production through expression of, for instance, higher protein, carbohydrate, nutrient or vitamin levels than would normally be seen in the wildtype. In this regard, improved plants, especially pulses and tubers are preferred. Improved algae or other plants such as rape may be particularly useful in the production of vegetable oils or biofuels such as alcohols (especially methanol and ethanol), for instance. These may be engineered to express or overexpress high levels of oil or alcohols for use in the oil or biofuel industries. The invention also provides for improved parts of a plant. Plant parts include, but are not limited to, leaves, stems, roots, tubers, seeds, endosperm, ovule, and pollen. Plant parts as envisaged herein may be viable, nonviable, regeneratable, and/or non-regeneratable. It is also encompassed herein to provide plant cells and plants generated according to the methods of the invention. Gametes, seeds, embryos, either zygotic or somatic, progeny or hybrids of plants comprising the genetic modification, which are produced by traditional breeding methods, are also included within the scope of the present invention. Such plants may contain a heterologous or foreign DNA sequence inserted at or instead of a target sequence. Alternatively, such plants may contain only an alteration (mutation, deletion, insertion, substitution) in one or more nucleotides. As such, such plants will only be different from their progenitor plants by the presence of the particular modification. Thus, the invention provides a plant, animal or cell, produced by the present methods, or a progeny thereof. The progeny may be a clone of the produced plant or animal, or may result from sexual reproduction by crossing with other individuals of the same species to introgress further desirable traits into their offspring. The cell may be in vivo or ex vivo in the cases of multicellular organisms, particularly animals or plants. The methods for genome editing using the Cpf1 system as described herein can be used to confer desired traits on essentially any plant, algae, fungus, yeast, etc. A wide variety of plants, algae, fungus, yeast, etc and plant algae, fungus, yeast cell or tissue systems may be engineered for the desired physiological and agronomic characteristics described herein using the nucleic acid constructs of the present disclosure and the various transformation methods mentioned above. In particular embodiments, the methods described herein are used to modify endogenous genes or to modify their expression without the permanent introduction into the genome of the plant, algae, fungus, yeast, etc of any foreign gene, including those encoding CRISPR components, so as to avoid the presence of foreign DNA in the genome of the plant. This can be of interest as the regulatory requirements for non-transgenic plants are less rigorous. The CRISPR systems provided herein can be used to introduce targeted double-strand or single-strand breaks and/or to introduce gene activator and or repressor systems and without being limitative, can be used for gene targeting, gene replacement, targeted mutagenesis, targeted deletions or insertions, targeted inversions and/or targeted translocations. By co-expression of multiple targeting RNAs directed to achieve multiple modifications in a single cell, multiplexed genome modification can be ensured. This technology can be used to high-precision engineering of plants with improved characteristics, including enhanced nutritional quality, increased resistance to diseases and resistance to biotic and abiotic stress, and increased production of commercially valuable plant products or heterologous compounds. The methods described herein generally result in the generation of \"improved plants, algae, fungi, yeast, etc\" in that they have one or more desirable traits compared to the wildtype plant. In particular embodiments, the plants, algae, fungi, yeast, etc., cells or parts obtained are transgenic plants, comprising an exogenous DNA sequence incorporated into the genome of all or part of the cells.

In such embodiments, the improved plants, algae, fungi, yeast, etc. are non-transgenic. Where only the modification of an endogenous gene is ensured and no foreign genes are introduced or maintained in the plant, algae, fungi, yeast, etc. genome, the resulting genetically modified crops contain no foreign genes and can thus basically be considered non-transgenic. The different applications of the Cpf1 CRISPR system for plant, algae, fungi, yeast, etc. genome editing include, but are not limited to: introduction of one or more foreign genes to confer an agricultural trait of interest; editing of endogenous genes to confer an agricultural trait of interest; modulating of endogenous genes by the Cpf1 CRISPR system to confer an agricultural trait of interest.

In other aspects, the invention provides a eukaryotic organism; preferably a multicellular eukaryotic organism, comprising a eukaryotic host cell according to any of the described embodiments. The organism in some embodiments of these aspects may be an animal; for example a mammal. Also, the organism may be an arthropod such as an insect. The present invention may also be extended to other agricultural applications such as, for example, farm and production animals. For example, pigs have many features that make them attractive as biomedical models, especially in regenerative medicine. In particular, pigs with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) may provide useful models for regenerative medicine, xenotransplantation (discussed also elsewhere herein), and tumor development and will aid in developing therapies for human SCID patients. Lee et al., (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) system to generated targeted modifications of recombination activating gene (RAG) 2 in somatic cells at high efficiency, including some that affected both alleles. The Cpf1 effector protein may be applied to a similar system. The methods of Lee et al., (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2014 May 20; 111(20):7260-5) may be applied to the present invention analogously as follows. Mutated pigs are produced by targeted modification of RAG2 in fetal fibroblast cells followed by SCNT and embryo transfer. Constructs coding for CRISPR Cas and a reporter are electroporated into fetal-derived fibroblast cells. After 48 h, transfected cells expressing the green fluorescent protein are sorted into individual wells of a 96-well plate at an estimated dilution of a single cell per well. Targeted modification of RAG2 are screened by amplifying a genomic DNA fragment flanking any CRISPR Cas cutting sites followed by sequencing the PCR products. After screening and ensuring lack of off-site mutations, cells carrying targeted modification of RAG2 are used for SCNT. The polar body, along with a portion of the adjacent cytoplasm of oocyte, presumably containing the metaphase II plate, are removed, and a donor cell are placed in the perivitelline. The reconstructed embryos are then electrically porated to fuse the donor cell with the oocyte and then chemically activated. The activated embryos are incubated in Porcine Zygote Medium 3 (PZM3) with 0.5 M Scriptaid (S7817; Sigma-Aldrich) for 14-16 h. Embryos are then washed to remove the Scriptaid and cultured in PZM3 until they were transferred into the oviducts of surrogate pigs. The present invention is used to create a platform to model a disease or disorder of an animal, in some embodiments a mammal, in some embodiments a human. In certain embodiments, such models and platforms are rodent based, in non-limiting examples rat or mouse. Such models and platforms can take advantage of distinctions among and comparisons between inbred rodent strains. In certain embodiments, such models and platforms primate, horse, cattle, sheep, goat, swine, dog, cat or bird-based, for example to directly model diseases and disorders of such animals or to create modified and/or improved lines of such animals. Advantageously, in certain embodiments, an animal based platform or model is created to mimic a human disease or disorder. For example, the similarities of swine to humans make swine an ideal platform for modeling human diseases. Compared to rodent models, development of swine models has been costly and time intensive. On the other hand, swine and other animals are much more similar to humans genetically, anatomically, physiologically and pathophysiologically. The present invention provides a high efficiency platform for targeted gene and genome editing, gene and genome modification and gene and genome regulation to be used in such animal platforms and models. Though ethical standards block development of human models and in many cases models based on non-human primates, the present invention is used with in vitro systems, including but not limited to cell culture systems, three dimensional models and systems, and organoids to mimic, model, and investigate genetics, anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology of structures, organs, and systems of humans. The platforms and models provide manipulation of single or multiple targets. In certain embodiments, the present invention is applicable to disease models like that of Schomberg et al. (FASEB Journal, April 2016; 30(1):Suppl 571.1). To model the inherited disease neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) Schomberg used CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce mutations in the swine neurofibromin 1 gene by cytosolic microinjection of CRISPR/Cas9 components into swine embryos. CRISPR guide RNAs (gRNA) were created for regions targeting sites both upstream and downstream of an exon within the gene for targeted cleavage by Cas9 and repair was mediated by a specific single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) template to introduce a 2500 bp deletion. The CRISPR-Cas system was also used to engineer swine with specific NF-1 mutations or clusters of mutations, and futher can be used to engineer mutations that are specific to or representative of a given human individual. The invention is similarly used to develop animal models, including but not limited to swine models, of human multigenic diseases. According to the invention, multiple genetic loci in one gene or in multiple genes are simultaneously targeted using multiplexed guides and optionally one or multiple templates. The present invention is also applicable to modifying SNPs of other animals, such as cows. Tan et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2013 Oct. 8; 110(41): 16526-16531) expanded the livestock gene editing toolbox to include transcription activator-like (TAL) effector nuclease (TALEN)- and gRNA the Church lab gRNA vector (Addgene ID: 41824) according to their methods (Mali P, et al. (2013) RNA-Guided Human Genome Engineering via Cas9. Science 339(6121):823-826). The Cas9 by sub-cloning the XbaI-AgeI fragment from the cDNA) into the RCIScript plasmid. 2015 Feb. 1; 24(3):393-402. doi: 10.1089/scd.2014.0278. Epub 2014 Nov. 3) reported highly efficient gene targeting in the bovine genome using bovine pluripotent cells and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 nuclease. First, Heo et al. induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from bovine somatic fibroblasts by the and MEK inhibitor (2i) treatment. Heo et al. observed that these bovine iPSCs are highly similar to na\u00efve pluripotent stem cells with regard to gene expression and developmental potential in teratomas. Moreover, CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease, which was specific for the bovine NANOG locus, showed highly efficient editing of the bovine genome in bovine iPSCs and embryos. Igenity\u00ae provides a profile analysis of animals, such as cows, to perform and transmit traits of economic traits of economic importance, such as carcass composition, carcass quality, maternal and reproductive traits and average daily gain. The analysis of a comprehensive Igenity\u00ae profile begins with the discovery of DNA markers (often single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs). All the markers behind the Igenity\u00ae profile were discovered by independent scientists at research institutions, including universities, research organizations, and government entities such as USDA. Markers are then analyzed at Igenity\u00ae in validation populations. Igenity\u00ae uses multiple resource populations that represent various production environments and biological types, often working with industry partners from the seedstock, cow-calf, feedlot and/or packing segments of the beef industry to collect phenotypes that are not commonly available. Cattle genome databases are widely available, see, e.g., the NAGRP Cattle Genome Coordination Program (www.animalgenome.org/cattle/maps/db.html). Thus, the present invention maybe applied to target bovine SNPs. One of skill in the art may utilize the above protocols for targeting SNPs and apply them to bovine SNPs as described, for example, by Tan et al. or Heo et al. Qingjian Zou et al. (Journal of Molecular Cell Biology Advance Access published Oct. 12, 2015) demonstrated increased muscle mass in dogs by targeting targeting the first exon of the dog Myostatin (MSTN) gene (a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass). First, the efficiency of the sgRNA was validated, using cotransfection of the the sgRNA targeting MSTN with a Cas9 vector into canine embryonic fibroblasts (CEFs). Thereafter, MSTN KO dogs were generated by micro-injecting embryos with normal morphology with a mixture of Cas9 mRNA and MSTN sgRNA and auto-transplantation of the zygotes into the oviduct of the same female dog. The knock-out puppies displayed an obvious muscular phenotype on thighs compared with its wild-type littermate sister. This can also be performed using the Cpf1 CRISPR systems provided herein.Livestock\u2014Pigs Viral targets in livestock may include, in some embodiments, porcine CD163, for example on porcine macrophages. CD163 is associated with infection (thought to be through viral cell entry) by PRRSv (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus, an arterivirus). Infection by PRRSv, especially of porcine alveolar macrophages (found in the lung), results in a previously incurable porcine syndrome (\"Mystery swine disease\" or \"blue ear disease\") that causes suffering, including reproductive failure, weight loss and high mortality rates in domestic pigs. Opportunistic infections, such as enzootic pneumonia, meningitis and ear oedema, are often seen due to immune deficiency through loss of macrophage activity. It also has significant economic and environmental repercussions due to increased antibiotic use and financial loss (an estimated $660m per year). As reported by Kristin M Whitworth and Dr Randall Prather et al. (Nature Biotech 3434 published online 7 Dec. 2015) at the University of Missouri and in collaboration with Genus Plc, CD163 was targeted using CRISPR-Cas9 and the offspring of edited pigs were resistant when exposed to PRRSv. One founder male and one founder female, both of whom had mutations in exon 7 of CD163, were bred to produce offspring. The founder male possessed an 11-bp deletion in exon 7 on one allele, which results in a frameshift mutation and missense translation at amino acid 45 in domain 5 and a subsequent premature stop codon at amino acid 64. The other allele had a 2-bp addition in exon 7 and a 377-bp deletion in the preceding intron, which were predicted to result in the expression of the first 49 amino acids of domain 5, followed by a premature stop code at amino acid 85. The sow had a 7 bp addition in one allele that when translated was predicted to express the first 48 amino acids of domain 5, followed by a premature stop codon at amino acid 70. The sow's other allele was unamplifiable. Selected offspring were predicted to be a null animal (CD163/), i.e. a CD163 knock out. Accordingly, in some embodiments, porcine alveolar macrophages may be targeted by the CRISPR protein. In some embodiments, porcine CD163 may be targeted by the CRISPR protein. In some embodiments, porcine CD163 may be knocked out through induction of a DSB or through insertions or deletions, for example targeting deletion or modification of exon 7, including one or more of those described above, or in other regions of the gene, for example deletion or modification of exon 5. An edited pig and its progeny are also envisaged, for example a CD163 knock out pig. This may be for livestock, breeding or modelling purposes (i.e. a porcine model). Semen comprising the gene knock out is also provided. CD163 is a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) superfamily. Based on in vitro studies SRCR domain 5 of the protein is the domain responsible for unpackaging and release of the viral genome. As such, other members of the SRCR superfamily may also be targeted in order to assess resistance to other viruses. PRRSV is also a member of the mammalian arterivirus group, which also includes murine lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, fever arteriviruses share important pathogenesis properties, including macrophage tropism and the capacity to cause both severe disease and persistent infection. Accordingly, arteriviruses, and in particular murine lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, simian hemorrhagic fever virus and equine virus, may be targeted, for example through porcine CD163 or homologues thereof in other species, and murine, simian and equine models and knockout also provided. Indeed, this approach may be extended to viruses or bacteria that cause other livestock diseases that may be transmitted to humans, such as Swine Influenza Virus (SIV) strains which include influenza C and the subtypes of influenza A known as H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, and meningitis and oedema mentioned above.Applications in Treating, Diagnosing, and Preventing Diseases Therapeutic Targeting with RNA-Guided Cpf1 Effector Protein Complex As will be apparent, it is envisaged that the present system can be used to target any polynucleotide sequence of interest. The invention provides a non-naturally occurring or engineered composition, or one or more polynucleotides encoding components of said composition, or vector or delivery systems comprising one or more polynucleotides encoding components of said composition for use in a modifying a target cell in vivo, ex vivo or in vitro and, may be conducted in a manner alters the cell such that once modified the progeny or cell line of the CRISPR modified cell retains the altered phenotype. The modified cells and progeny may be part of a multi-cellular organism such as a plant or animal with ex vivo or in vivo application of CRISPR system to desired cell types. The CRISPR invention may be a therapeutic method of treatment. The therapeutic method of treatment may comprise gene or genome editing, or gene therapy.Treating Pathogens, Like Bacterial, Fungal and Parasitic Pathogens The present invention may also be applied to treat bacterial, fungal and parasitic pathogens. Most research efforts have focused on developing new antibiotics, which once developed, would nevertheless be subject to the same problems of drug resistance. The invention provides novel CRISPR-based alternatives which overcome those difficulties. Furthermore, unlike existing antibiotics, CRISPR-based treatments can be made pathogen specific, inducing bacterial cell death of a target pathogen while avoiding beneficial bacteria. Jiang et al. (\"RNA-guided editing of bacterial genomes using CRISPR-Cas systems,\" Nature Biotechnology vol. 31, p. 233-9, March 2013) used a CRISPR-Cas9 system to mutate or kill S. pneumoniae and E. coli. The work, which introduced precise mutations into the genomes, relied on dual-RNA:Cas9-directed cleavage at the targeted genomic site to kill unmutated cells and circumvented the need for selectable markers or counter-selection systems. CRISPR systems have be used to reverse antibiotic resistance and eliminate the transfer of resistance between strains. Bickard et al. showed that Cas9, reprogrammed to target virulence genes, kills virulent, but not avirulent, S. aureus. Reprogramming the nuclease to target antibiotic resistance genes destroyed staphylococcal plasmids that harbor antibiotic resistance genesand immunized against the spread of plasmid-borne resistance genes. (see, et al., \"Exploiting CRISPR-Cas nucleases produce sequence-specific antimicrobials,\" Nature Biotechnology vol. 32, 1146-1150, doi:10.1038/nbt.3043, published online 5 Oct. 2014.) Bikard showed that CRISPR-Cas9 antimicrobials function in vivo to kill S. aureus in a mouse skin colonization model. Similarly, Yosef et al used a CRISPR system to target genes encoding enzymes that confer resistance to -lactam antibiotics (see Yousef et al., \"Temperate and lytic kill antibiotic-resistant Sci. USA, vol. 112, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1500107112 published online May 18, 2015). CRISPR systems can be used to edit genomes of parasites that are resistant to other genetic approaches. For example, a CRISPR-Cas9 system was shown to introduce double-stranded breaks into the in the Plasmodium yoelii genome (see, Zhang et al., \"Efficient Editing of Malaria Parasite Genome Using the CRISPR/Cas9 System,\" vol. 5, e01414-14, July-August 2014). Ghorbal et al. (\"Genome editing in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparumusing the CRISPR-Cas9 system,\" Nature Biotechnology, vol. 32, p. 819-821, doi: 10.1038/nbt.2925, published online Jun. 1, 2014) modified the sequences of two genes, orcl and kelch13, which have putative roles in gene silencing and emerging resistance to artemisinin, respectively. Parasites that were altered at the appropriate sites were recovered with very high efficiency, despite there being no direct selection for the modification, indicating that neutral or even deleterious mutations can be generated using this system. CRISPR-Cas9 is also used to modify the genomes of other pathogenic parasites, including Toxoplasma gondii (see Shen et al., \"Efficient gene disruption in diverse strains of Toxoplasma gondii using One vol. 9, e100450, doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0100450, published online 27, 2014). Vyas et al. (\"A Candida albicans CRISPR system permits genetic engineering of essential genes and gene families,\" Science Advances, vol. 1, e1500248, DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.1500248, Apr. 3, 2015) employed a CRISPR system to overcome long-standing obstacles to genetic engineering in C. albicans and efficiently mutate in a single experiment both copies of several different genes. In an organism where several mechanisms contribute to drug resistance, Vyas produced homozygous double mutants that no longer displayed the hyper-resistance to fluconazole or cycloheximide displayed by the parental clinical isolate Can90. Vyas also obtained homozygous loss-of-function mutations in essential genes of C. albicans by creating conditional alleles. Null alleles of DCR1, which may be needed for ribosomal RNA processing, are lethal at low temperature but viable at high temperature. Vyas used a repair template that introduced a nonsense mutation and isolated dcr1/dcr1 mutants that failed to grow at 16\u00b0 C. The CRISPR system of the present invention for use in P. falciparum by disrupting chromosomal loci. Ghorbal et al. (\"Genome editing in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum using the CRISPR-Cas9 system\", Nature Biotechnology, 32, 819-821 (2014), DOI: 10.1038/nbt.2925, Jun. 1, 2014) employed a CRISPR system to introduce specific gene knockouts and single-nucleotide substitutions in the malaria genome. To adapt the CRISPR-Cas9 system to P. falciparum, Ghorbal et al. generated expression vectors for under the control of plasmodial regulatory elements in the pUF1-Cas9 episome that also carries the drug-selectable marker ydhodh, which to DSM1, a P. falciparum dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (PfDHODH) inhibitor used P. falciparum U6 small nuclear (sn)RNA regulatory elements placing the guide RNA and the donor DNA template for homologous recombination repair on the same plasmid, pL7. See also, Zhang C. et al. (\"Efficient editing of malaria parasite genome using 2014 (\"Efficient falciparum, Nature (2014), DOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3063).Treating Pathogens, Like Viral Pathogens Such as Hiv Cas-mediated genome editing might be used to introduce protective mutations in somatic tissues to combat nongenetic or complex diseases. For example, NHEJ-mediated inactivation of the CCR5 receptor in lymphocytes (Lombardo et al., Nat Biotechnol. 2007 November; 25(11):1298-306) may be a viable strategy for circumventing HIV infection, whereas deletion of PCSK9 (Cohen et al., Nat Genet. 2005 February; 37(2):161-5) orangiopoietin (Musunuru et al., N Engl J Med. 2010 De 2; 363(23):2220-7) may provide therapeutic effects against statin-resistant hypercholesterolemia or hyperlipidemia. Although these targets may be also addressed using siRNA-mediated protein knockdown, a unique advantage of NHEJ-mediated gene inactivation is the ability to achieve permanent therapeutic benefit without the need for continuing treatment. As with all gene therapies, it will of course be important to establish that each proposed therapeutic use has a favorable benefit-risk ratio. Hydrodynamic delivery of plasmid DNA encoding Cas9 nd guide RNA along with a repair template into the liver of an adult mouse model of tyrosinemia was shown to be able to correct the mutant Fah gene and rescue expression of the wild-type Fah protein in 1 out of 250 cells (Nat Biotechnol. 2014 June; 32(6):551-3). In addition, clinical trials successfully used ZF nucleases to combat HIV infection by ex vivo knockout of the CCR5 receptor. In all patients, HIV DNA levels decreased, and in one out of four patients, HIV RNA became undetectable (Tebas et al., N Engl J Med. 2014 Mar. 6; 370(10):901-10). Both of these results demonstrate the promise of programmable nucleases as a new therapeutic platform. In another embodiment, self-inactivating lentiviral vectors with an siRNA targeting a common exon shared by HIV tat/rev, a nucleolar-localizing TAR decoy, and an anti-CCR5-specific hammerhead ribozyme e.g., DiGiusto et al. (2010) Sci Transl Med 2:36ra43) may be used/and or adapted to the CRISPR-Cas system of the present invention. A minimum of 2.5\u00d7106 CD34+ cells per kilogram patient weight may be collected and prestimulated for 16 to 20 hours in X-VIVO 15 medium (Lonza) containing 2 mol/L-glutamine, stem cell cells/ml. cells may be transduced with lentiviral at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for 16 to 24 hours in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks coated with fibronectin (25 mg/cm2) (RetroNectin, Takara Bio Inc.). With the knowledge in the art and the teachings in this disclosure the skilled person can correct HSCs as to immunodeficiency condition such as HIV/AIDS comprising contacting an HSC with a CRISPR-Cpf1 system that targets and knocks out CCR5. An guide RNA (and advantageously a dual guide approach, e.g., a pair of different guide RNAs; for instance, guide RNAs targeting of two clinically relevant genes, B2M and CCR5, in primary human CD4+ T cells and CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs)) that targets and knocks out CCR5-and-Cpf1 protein containing particle is contacted with HSCs. The so contacted cells can be administered; and optionally treated/expanded; cf. Cartier. See also Kiem, \"Hematopoietic stem cell-based gene therapy for HIV disease,\" Cell Stem Cell. Feb. 3, 2012; 10(2): 137-147; incorporated herein by reference along with the documents it cites; Mandal et al, \"Efficient Ablation of Genes in Human Hematopoietic Stem and Effector Cells using CRISPR/Cas9,\" Cell Stem Cell, Volume 15, Issue 5, p643-652, 6 Nov. 2014; incorporated herein by reference along with the documents it cites. Mention is also made of Ebina, \"CRISPR/Cas9 system to suppress HIV-1 expression by editing HIV-1 integrated proviral DNA\" SCIENTIFIC REPORTS 3: 2510 DOI: 10.1038/srep02510, incorporated herein by reference along with the documents it cites, as another means for combatting HIV/AIDS using a CRISPR-Cpf1 system. The rationale for genome editing for HIV treatment originates from the observation that individuals homozygous for loss of function mutations in CCR5, a cellular co-receptor for the virus, are highly resistant to infection and otherwise healthy, suggesting that mimicking this mutation with genome editing could be a safe and effective therapeutic strategy [Liu, R., et al. Cell 86, 367-377 (1996)]. This idea was clinically validated when an HIV infected patient was given an allogeneic bone marrow transplant from a donor homozygous for a loss of function CCR5 mutation, resulting in undetectable levels of HIV and restoration of normal CD4 T-cell counts [Hutter, G., et al. The New England journal of medicine 360, 692-698 (2009)]. Although bone marrow transplantation is not a realistic treatment strategy for most HIV patients, due to cost and potential graft vs. host disease, HIV therapies that convert a patient's own T-cells into CCR5 are desirable. Early studies using ZFNs and NHEJ to knockout CCR5 in humanized mouse models of HIV showed that transplantation of CCR5 edited CD4 T cells improved viral load and CD4 T-cell counts [Perez, E. E., et al. Nature biotechnology 26, 808-816 (2008)]. Importantly, these models also showed that HIV infection resulted in selection for CCR5 null cells, suggesting that editing confers a fitness advantage and potentially allowing a small number of edited cells to create a therapeutic effect. As a result of this and other promising preclinical studies, genome editing therapy that knocks out CCR5 in patient T cells has now been tested in humans [Holt, N., et al. Nature biotechnology 28, 839-847 (2010); Li, L., et al. Molecular therapy: the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy 21, 1259-1269 (2013)]. In a recent phase I clinical trial, CD4+ T cells from patients with HIV were removed, edited with ZFNs designed to knockout the CCR5 gene, and autologously transplanted back into patients [Tebas, P., et al. The New England journal of medicine 370, 901-910 (2014)]. In another study (Mandal et al., Cell Stem Cell, Volume 15, Issue 5, p643-652, 6 Nov. 2014), CRISPR-Cas9 has targeted two clinical relevant genes, B2M and CCR5, in human CD4+ T cells and CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Use of single RNA guides led to highly efficient mutagenesis in HSPCs but not in T cells. A dual guide approach improved gene deletion efficacy in both cell types. HSPCs that had undergone genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9 retained multilineage potential. Predicted on- and off-target mutations were examined via target capture sequencing in HSPCs and low levels of off-target mutagenesis were observed at only one site. These results demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas9 can efficiently ablate genes in HSPCs with minimal off-target mutagenesis, which have broad applicability for hematopoietic cell-based therapy. Wang et al. (PLoS One. 9(12):e115987. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0115987) silenced CCR5 CRISPR and single guided RNAs (guide RNAs) with lentiviral vectors expressing Cas9 and CCR5 guide RNAs. Wang et al. showed that a single round transduction of lentiviral vectors expressing Cas9 and CCR5 guide RNAs into HIV-1 susceptible human CD4+ cells yields high frequencies of CCR5 gene disruption. CCR5 gene-disrupted cells are not only resistant to R5-tropic HIV-1, including transmitted/founder (T/F) HIV-1 isolates, but also have selective advantage over CCR5 gene-undisrupted cells during R5-tropic HIV-1 infection. Genome mutations at potential off-target sites that are highly homologous to these CCR5 guide RNAs in stably transduced cells even at 84 days post transduction were not detected by a T7 endonuclease I assay. Fine et al. (Sci Rep. 2015 Jul. 1; 5:10777. doi: 10.1038/srep10777) identified a two-cassette system expressing the S. pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) protein which splice together in cellula to form a functional protein capable of site-specific DNA cleavage. With specific CRISPR guide strands, Fine et al. demonstrated the efficacy of this system in cleaving the HBB and CCR5 genes in human HEK-293T cells as a single Cas9 and as a pair of Cas9 nickases. The trans-spliced SpCas9 (tsSpCas9) displayed the wild-type SpCas9 (wtSpCas9) at standard transfection doses, but had substantially decreased activity at lower dosing levels. The greatly reduced open reading frame length of the tsSpCas9 relative to wtSpCas9 potentially allows for more complex and longer genetic elements to be packaged into an AAV vector including tissue-specific promoters, multiplexed guide RNA expression, and effector domain fusions to SpCas9. Li et 2015 August; 96(8):2381-93. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.000139. Epub 2015 Apr. 8) demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9 can efficiently mediate the editing of the CCR5 locus in cell lines, resulting in the knockout of CCR5 expression on the cell surface. Next-generation sequencing revealed that various mutations were introduced around the predicted cleavage site of CCR5. For each of the three effective guide RNAs that were analyzed, no significant off-target effects were detected at the 15 top-scoring potential sites. By constructing chimeric Ad5F35 adenoviruses carrying CRISPR-Cas9 components, Li et al. efficiently transduced primary CD4+T-lymphocytes and disrupted CCR5 expression, and the positively transduced cells were conferred with HIV-1 resistance. One of skill in the art may utilize the above studies of, for example, Holt, N., et al. Nature biotechnology 28, 839-847 (2010), Li, L., et al. Molecular therapy: the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy 21, 1259-1269 (2013), Mandal et al., Cell Stem Cell, Volume 15, Issue 5, p643-652, 6 Nov. 2014, Wang et al. (PLoS One. 2014 Dec. 26; 9(12):e115987. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0115987), Fine (Sci Rep. 2015 Jul. 1; 5:10777. doi: 10.1038/srep10777) and Li August; 96(8):2381-93. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.000139. Epub 2015 Apr. 8) for targeting CCR5 with the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention.Treating Pathogens, Like Viral Pathogens, Such as HBV The present invention may also be applied to treat hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, the CRISPR Cas system may be adapted to avoid the shortcomings of RNAi, such as the risk of oversatring endogenous small RNA pathways, by for example, optimizing dose and sequence (see, e.g., Grimm et al., Nature vol. 441, 26 May 2006). For example, low doses, such as about 1-10\u00d71014 particles per human are contemplated. In another embodiment, the CRISPR Cas system directed against HBV may be administered in liposomes, such as a stable nucleic-acid-lipid particle (SNALP) (see, e.g., Morrissey et al., Nature Biotechnology, Vol. 23, No. 8, August 2005). Daily intravenous injections of about 1, 3 or 5 mg/kg/day of CRISPR Cas targeted to HBV RNA in a SNALP are contemplated. The daily treatment may be over about three days and then weekly for about five weeks. In another embodiment, the system of Chen et al. (Gene Therapy (2007) 14, 11-19) may be used/and or adapted for the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention. Chen et al. use a double-stranded adenoassociated virus 8-pseudotyped vector (dsAAV2/8) to deliver shRNA. A single administration of dsAAV2/8 vector (1\u00d71012 vector genomes per mouse), carrying HBV-specific shRNA, effectively suppressed the steady level of HBV protein, mRNA and replicative DNA in liver of HBV transgenic mice, leading to up to 2-3 log 10 decrease in HBV load in the circulation. Significant HBV suppression sustained for at least 120 days after vector administration. The therapeutic effect of shRNA was target sequence dependent and did not involve activation of interferon. For the present invention, a CRISPR Cas system directed to HBV may be cloned into an AAV vector, such as a dsAAV2/8 vector and administered to a human, for example, at a dosage of about 1\u00d71015 vector genomes to about 1\u00d71016 vector genomes per human. In another embodiment, the method of Wooddell et al. (Molecular Therapy vol. 21 no. 5, 973-985 May 2013) may be used/and or adapted to the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention. Woodell et al. show that simple coinjection of efficient F7 knockdown in mice and nonhuman primates without changes in clinical chemistry or induction of cytokines. Using transient and transgenic mouse models of HBV infection, Wooddell et al. show that a single coinjection of NAG-MLP with potent chol-siRNAs targeting conserved HBV sequences resulted in multilog repression of viral RNA, proteins, and viral DNA with long duration of effect. Intraveinous coinjections, for example, of about 6 mg/kg of NAG-MLP and 6 mg/kg of HBV specific CRISPR Cas may be envisioned for the present invention. In the alternative, about 3 mg/kg of NAG-MLP and 3 mg/kg of HBV specific CRISPR Cas may be delivered on day one, followed by administration of about about 2-3 mg/kg of NAG-MLP and 2-3 mg/kg of HBV specific CRISPR Cas two weeks later. In some embodiments, the target sequence is an HBV sequence. In some embodiments, the target sequences is comprised in an episomal viral nucleic acid molecule which is not integrated into the genome of the organism to thereby manipulate the episomal viral nucleic acid molecule. In some embodiments, the episomal nucleic acid molecule is a double-stranded DNA polynucleotide molecule or is a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). In some embodiments, the CRISPR complex is capable of reducing the amount of episomal viral nucleic acid molecule in a cell of the organism compared to the amount of episomal viral nucleic acid molecule in a cell of the organism in the absence of providing the complex, or is capable of manipulating the episomal viral nucleic acid molecule to promote degradation of the episomal nucleic acid molecule. In some embodiments, the target HBV sequence is integrated into the genome of the organism. In some embodiments, when formed within the cell, the CRISPR complex is capable of manipulating the integrated nucleic acid to promote excision of all or part of the target HBV nucleic acid from the genome of the organism. In some embodiments, said at least one target HBV nucleic acid is comprised in a double-stranded DNA polynucleotide cccDNA molecule and/or viral DNA integrated into the genome of the organism and wherein the CRISPR complex manipulates at least one target HBV nucleic acid to cleave viral cccDNA and/or integrated viral DNA. In some embodiments, said cleavage comprises one or more double-strand break(s) introduced into the viral cccDNA and/or integrated viral DNA, optionally at least two double-strand break(s). In some embodiments, said cleavage is via one or more single-strand break(s) introduced into the viral cccDNA and/or integrated viral DNA, optionally at least two single-strand break(s). In some embodiments, said one or more double-strand break(s) or said one or more single-strand break(s) leads to the formation of one or more insertion or deletion mutations (INDELs) in the viral cccDNA sequences and/or integrated viral DNA sequences. Lin et Nucleic With the HBV-specific gRNAs, the CRISPR-Cas9 system significantly reduced the production of HBV core and surface proteins in Huh-7 cells transfected with an HBV-expression vector. Among eight screened gRNAs, two effective ones were identified. One gRNA targeting the conserved HBV sequence acted against different genotypes. Using a hydrodynamics-HBV persistence mouse model, Lin et al. further demonstrated that this system could cleave the intrahepatic HBV genome-containing plasmid and facilitate its clearance in vivo, resulting in reduction of serum surface antigen levels. These data suggest that the CRISPR-Cas9 system could disrupt the HBV-expressing templates both in vitro and in vivo, indicating its potential in eradicating persistent HBV infection. Dong et al. (Antiviral Res. 2015 June; 118:110-7. doi: 10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.03.015. Epub 2015 Apr. 3) used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to target the HBV genome and efficiently inhibit HBV infection. Dong et al. synthesized four single-guide RNAs (guide RNAs) targeting the conserved regions of HBV. The expression of these guide RNAS with Cas9 reduced the viral production in Huh7 cells as well as in HBV-replication cell HepG2.2.15. Dong et al. further demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9 direct cleavage and cleavage-mediated mutagenesis occurred in HBV cccDNA transfected cells. In the mouse model carrying HBV cccDNA, injection of guide RNA-Cas9 plasmids via rapid tail vein resulted in the low level of cccDNA and HBV protein. Liu et al. (J Gen Virol. 2015 August; 96(8):2252-61. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.000159. Epub 2015 Apr. eight guide RNAs (gRNAs) that targeted the conserved regions of different HBV genotypes, which could significantly inhibit HBV replication both in vitro and in vivo to investigate the possibility of using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to disrupt the HBV DNA templates. The HBV-specific gRNA/Cpf1 system could inhibit the replication of HBV of different genotypes in cells, and the viral DNA was significantly reduced by a single gRNA/Cpf1 system and cleared by a combination of different gRNA/Cpf1 systems. Wang et al. (World J Gastroenterol. 2015 Aug. 28; 21(32):9554-65. Eleven combinations of two above gRNAs (dual-gRNAs) covering the regulatory region of HBV were chosen. The efficiency of each gRNA and 11 dual-gRNAs on the suppression of HBV (genotypes A-D) replication was examined by the measurement of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) or e antigen (HBeAg) in the culture supernatant. The destruction of HBV-expressing vector was examined in HuH7 cells co-transfected with dual-gRNAs and HBV-expressing vector using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing method, and the destruction of cccDNA was examined in HepAD38 cells using KCl precipitation, plasmid-safe DNase (PSAD) digestion, circle amplification quantitative PCR combined method. The cytotoxicity of these gRNAs was assessed by a mitochondrial tetrazolium assay. All of gRNAs could significantly reduce HBsAg or HBeAg production in the culture supernatant, which was dependent on the region in which gRNA against. All of dual gRNAs could efficiently suppress HBsAg and/or HBeAg production for HBV of genotypes A-D, and the efficacy of dual gRNAs in suppressing HBsAg and/or HBeAg production was significantly increased when compared to the single gRNA used alone. Furthermore, by PCR direct sequencing we confirmed that these dual gRNAs could specifically destroy HBV expressing template by removing the fragment between the cleavage sites of the two used gRNAs. Most importantly, gRNA-5 and gRNA-12 combination not only could efficiently suppressing HBsAg and/or HBeAg production, but also destroy the cccDNA reservoirs in HepAD38 cells. Karimova et al. (Sci identified cross-genotype conserved HBV and X region of the HBV genome that were targeted for specific and effective cleavage by a Cas9 nickase. This approach disrupted not only episomal cccDNA and chromosomally integrated HBV target sites in reporter cell lines, but also HBV replication in chronically and de novo infected hepatoma cell lines. One of skill in the art may utilize the above studies of, for example, Lin et al. (Mol Ther Nucleic Acids. 2014 Aug. 19; 3:e186. 118:110-7. doi: 10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.03.015. Epub 2015 Apr. 3), Virol. 2015 August; 96(8):2252-61. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.000159.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is prevalent, deadly, and seldom cured due to the persistence of viral episomal DNA (cccDNA) in infected cells. Ramanan et al. (Ramanan V, Shlomai A, Cox D B, Schwartz R E, Michailidis E, Bhatta A, Scott D A, Zhang F, Rice C M, Bhatia S N, Sci Rep. 2015 Jun. 2; 5:10833. doi: 10.1038/srep10833, published online 2nd June 2015.) showed that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can specifically target and cleave conserved regions in the HBV genome, resulting in robust suppression of viral gene expression and replication. Upon sustained expression of Cas9 and appropriately chosen guide RNAs, they demonstrated cleavage of cccDNA by Cas9 and a dramatic reduction in both cccDNA and other parameters of viral gene expression and replication. Thus, they showed that directly targeting viral episomal DNA is a novel therapeutic approach to control the virus and possibly cure patients. This is also described in WO2015089465 A1, in the name of The Broad Institute et al., the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference As such targeting viral episomal DNA in HBV is preferred in some embodiments. The present invention may also be applied to treat pathogens, e.g. bacterial, fungal and parasitic pathogens. Most research efforts have focused on developing new antibiotics, which once developed, would nevertheless be subject to the same problems of drug resistance. The invention provides novel CRISPR-based alternatives which overcome those difficulties. Furthermore, unlike existing antibiotics, CRISPR-based treatments can be made pathogen specific, inducing bacterial cell death of a target pathogen while avoiding beneficial bacteria. The present invention may also be applied to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV). The methods of Roelvinki et al. (Molecular Therapy vol. 20 no. 9, 1737-1749 September 2012) may be applied to the CRISPR Cas system. For example, an AAV vector such as AAV8 may be a contemplated vector and for example a dosage of about 1.25\u00d71011 to 1.25\u00d71013 vector genomes per kilogram body weight (vg/kg) may be contemplated. The present invention may also be applied to treat pathogens, e.g. bacterial, fungal and parasitic pathogens. Most research efforts have focused on developing new antibiotics, which once developed, would nevertheless be subject to the same problems of drug resistance. The invention provides novel CRISPR-based alternatives which overcome those difficulties. Furthermore, unlike existing antibiotics, CRISPR-based treatments can be made pathogen specific, inducing bacterial cell death of a target pathogen while avoiding beneficial bacteria. Jiang et al. (\"RNA-guided editing of bacterial genomes using CRISPR-Cas systems,\" Nature Biotechnology vol. 31, p. 233-9, March 2013) used a CRISPR-Cas9 system to mutate or kill S. pneumoniae and E. coli. The work, which introduced precise mutations into the genomes, relied on dual-RNA:Cas9-directed cleavage at the targeted genomic site to kill unmutated cells and circumvented the need for selectable markers or counter-selection systems. CRISPR systems have be used to reverse antibiotic resistance and eliminate the transfer of resistance between strains. Bickard et al. showed that Cas9, reprogrammed to target virulence genes, kills virulent, but not avirulent, S. aureus. Reprogramming the nuclease to target antibiotic resistance genes destroyed staphylococcal plasmids that harbor antibiotic resistance genesand immunized against the spread of plasmid-borne resistance genes. (see, et al., \"Exploiting CRISPR-Cas nucleases produce sequence-specific antimicrobials,\" Nature Biotechnology vol. 32, 1146-1150, doi:10.1038/nbt.3043, published online 5 Oct. 2014.) Bikard showed that CRISPR-Cas9 antimicrobials function in vivo to kill S. aureus in a mouse skin colonization model. Similarly, Yosef et al used a CRISPR system to target genes encoding enzymes that confer resistance to -lactam antibiotics (see Yousef et al., \"Temperate and lytic kill antibiotic-resistant Sci. USA, vol. 112, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1500107112 published online May 18, 2015). CRISPR systems can be used to edit genomes of parasites that are resistant to other genetic approaches. For example, a CRISPR-Cas9 system was shown to introduce double-stranded breaks into the in the Plasmodium yoelii genome (see, Zhang et al., \"Efficient Editing of Malaria Parasite Genome Using the CRISPR/Cas9 System,\" vol. 5, e01414-14, July-August 2014). Ghorbal et al. (\"Genome editing in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparumusing the CRISPR-Cas9 system,\" Nature Biotechnology, vol. 32, p. 819-821, doi: 10.1038/nbt.2925, published online Jun. 1, 2014) modified the sequences of two genes, orc1 and kelch13, which have putative roles in gene silencing and emerging resistance to artemisinin, respectively. Parasites that were altered at the appropriate sites were recovered with very high efficiency, despite there being no direct selection for the modification, indicating that neutral or even deleterious mutations can be generated using this system. CRISPR-Cas9 is also used to modify the genomes of other pathogenic parasites, including Toxoplasma gondii (see Shen et al., \"Efficient gene disruption in diverse strains of Toxoplasma gondii using 9, e100450, doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0100450, published online 27, 2014). Vyas et al. (\"A Candida albicans CRISPR system permits genetic engineering of essential genes and gene families,\" Science Advances, vol. 1, e1500248, DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.1500248, Apr. 3, 2015) employed a CRISPR system to overcome long-standing obstacles to genetic engineering in C. albicans and efficiently mutate in a single experiment both copies of several different genes. In an organism where several mechanisms contribute to drug resistance, Vyas produced homozygous double mutants that no longer displayed the hyper-resistance to fluconazole or cycloheximide displayed by the parental clinical isolate Can90. Vyas also obtained homozygous loss-of-function mutations in essential genes of C. albicans by creating conditional alleles. Null alleles of DCR1, which may be needed for ribosomal RNA processing, are lethal at low temperature but viable at high temperature. Vyas used a repair template that introduced a nonsense mutation and isolated dcr1/dcr1 mutants that failed to grow at 16\u00b0 C. Treating Diseases with Genetic or Epigenetic Aspects The CRISPR-Cas systems of the present invention can be used to correct genetic mutations that were previously attempted with limited success using TALEN and ZFN and have been identified as potential targets for Cas9 systems, including as in published applications of Editas Medicine describing methods to use Cas9 systems to target loci to therapeutically address diseases with gene therapy, including, WO 2015/048577 CRISPR-RELATED METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS of Gluckmann et al.; WO 2015/070083 CRISPR-RELATED METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS WITH GOVERNING gRNAS of Glucksmann et al.; In some embodiments, the treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis of Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) is provided. The target is preferably the MYOC gene. This is described in WO2015153780, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Mention is made of WO2015/134812 CRISPR/CAS-RELATED METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR TREATING USHER SYNDROME AND RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA of Maeder et al. Through the teachings herein the invention comprehends methods and materials of these documents applied in conjunction with the teachings herein. In an aspect of ocular and auditory gene therapy, methods and compositions for treating Usher Syndrome and Retinis-Pigmentosa may be adapted to the CRISPR-Cas system of the present invention (see, e.g., WO 2015/134812). In an embodiment, the WO 2015/134812 involves a treatment or delaying the onset or progression of Usher Syndrome type IIA (USH2A, USHI1A) and retinitis pigmentosa 39 (RP39) by gene editing, e.g., using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated methods to correct the guanine deletion at position 2299 in the USH2A gene (e.g., replace the deleted guanine residue at position 2299 in the USH2A gene). A similar effect can be achieved with Cpf1. In a related aspect, a mutation is targeted by cleaving with either one or more nuclease, one or more nickase, or a combination thereof, e.g., to induce HDR with a donor template that corrects the point mutation (e.g., the single nucleotide, e.g., guanine, deletion). The alteration or correction of the mutant USH2A gene can be mediated by any mechanism. Exemplary mechanisms that can be associated with the alteration (e.g., correction) of the mutant HSH2A gene include, but are not limited to, non-homologous end joining, microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), homology-directed repair (e.g., strand annealing), single-strand annealing or single strand invasion. In an embodiment, the method used for treating Usher Syndrome and Retinis-Pigmentosa can include acquiring knowledge of the mutation carried by the subject, e.g., by sequencing the appropriate portion of the USH2A gene. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis of Retinitis Pigmentosa is provided. A number of different genes are known to be associated with or result in Retinitis Pigmentosa, such as RP1, RP2 and so forth. These genes are targeted in some embodiments and either knocked out or repaired through provision of suitable a template. In some embodiments, delivery is to the eye by injection. One or more Retinitis Pigmentosa genes can, in Mention is also made of WO 2015/138510 and through the teachings herein the invention (using a CRISPR-Cas9 system) comprehends providing a treatment or delaying the onset or progression of Leber's Congenital Amaurosis 10 (LCA 10). LCA 10 is caused by a mutation in the CEP290 gene, e.g., a c.2991+1655, adenine to guanine mutation in the CEP290 gene which gives rise to a cryptic splice site in intron 26. This is a mutation at nucleotide 1655 of intron 26 of CEP290, e.g., an A to G mutation. WO 2015/138510). In an aspect of gene therapy, the invention involves introducing one or more breaks near the site of the LCA target position (e.g., c.2991+1655; A to G) in at least one allele of the CEP290 gene. Altering the LCA10 target position refers to (1) break-induced introduction of an indel (also referred to herein as NHEJ-mediated introduction of an indel) in close proximity to or including a LCA10 target position (e.g., c.2991+1655A to G), or (2) break-induced deletion (also referred to herein as NHEJ-mediated deletion) of genomic sequence including the mutation at a LCA10 target position (e.g., c.2991+1655A to G). Both approaches give rise to the loss or destruction of the cryptic splice site resulting from the mutation at the LCA 10 target position. Accordingly, the use of Cpf1 in the treatment of LCA is specifically envisaged. Researchers are contemplating whether gene therapies could be employed to treat a wide range of diseases. The CRISPR systems of the present invention based on Cpf1 effector protein are envisioned for such therapeutic uses, including, but noted limited to further exemplified targeted areas and with delivery methods as below. Some examples of conditions or diseases that might be usefully treated using the present system are included in the examples of genes and references included herein and are currently associated with those conditions are also provided there. The genes and conditions exemplified are not exhaustive.Treating Diseases of the Circulatory System The present invention also contemplates delivering the CRISPR-Cas system, specifically the novel CRISPR effector protein systems described herein, to the blood or hematopoietic stem cells. The plasma exosomes of Wahlgren et al. (Nucleic Acids Research, 2012, Vol. 40, No. 17 e130) were previously described and may be utilized to deliver the CRISPR Cas system to the blood. The nucleic acid-targeting system of the present invention is also contemplated to treat hemoglobinopathies, such as thalassemias and sickle cell disease. See, e.g., International Patent Publication No. WO 2013/126794 for potential targets that may be targeted by the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention. Drakopoulou, \"Review Article, The Ongoing Challenge of Hematopoietic Stem Cell-Based Gene Therapy for -Thalassemia,\" Stem Cells International, Volume 2011, Article ID 987980, 10 pages, doi:10.4061/2011/987980, incorporated herein by reference along with the documents it cites, as if set out in full, discuss modifying HSCs using a lentivirus that delivers a gene for -globin or -globin. In contrast to using lentivirus, with the knowledge in the art and the teachings in this disclosure, the skilled person can correct HSCs as to -Thalassemia using a CRISPR-Cas system that targets and corrects the mutation (e.g., with a suitable HDR template that delivers a coding sequence for -globin or -globin, advantageously non-sickling -globin or -globin); specifically, the guide RNA can target mutation that give rise to -Thalassemia, and the HDR can provide coding for proper expression of -globin or -globin. An guide RNA that targets the mutation-and-Cas protein containing particle is contacted with HSCs carrying the mutation. The particle also can contain a suitable HDR template to correct the mutation for proper expression of -globin or -globin; or the HSC can be contacted with a second particle or a vector that contains or delivers the HDR template. The so contacted cells can be administered; and optionally treated/expanded; cf. Cartier. In this regard mention is made of: Cavazzana, \"Outcomes of Gene Therapy for -Thalassemia Major via Transplantation of Autologous Hematopoietic Stem gene therapy of human -thalassaemia\", Nature 467, 318-322 (16 Sep. 2010) doi:10.1038/nature09328; Nienhuis, \"Development of Gene Therapy for Thalassemia, Cold Spring Harbor Perpsectives in Medicine, doi: 10.1101/cshperspect.a011833 (2012), LentiGlobin BB305, a lentiviral vector containing an engineered -globin gene (PA-T87Q); and Xie et al., \"Seamless gene correction of -thalassaemia mutations in patient-specific and piggyback\" gr.173427.114 (2014) www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.173427.114 (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press); that is the subject of Cavazzana work involving human -thalassaemia and the subject of the Xie work, are all incorporated herein by reference, together with all documents cited therein or associated therewith. In the instant invention, the HDR template can provide for the HSC to express an engineered -globin gene (e.g., 3A-T87Q), or -globin as in Xie. Xu et al. (Sci Rep. 2015 Jul. 9; 5:12065. doi: 10.1038/srep12065) have designed TALENs and CRISPR-Cas9 to target the intron2 mutation site IVS2-654 in the globin gene. Xu et al. observed different frequencies of double-strand breaks (DSBs) at IVS2-654 loci using TALENs and CRISPR-Cas9, and TALENs mediated a higher homologous gene targeting efficiency compared to CRISPR-Cas9 when combined with the piggyBac transposon donor. In addition, more obvious off-target events were observed for CRISPR-Cas9 compared to TALENs. Finally, TALENs-corrected iPSC clones were selected for erythroblast differentiation using the OP9 co-culture system and detected relatively higher transcription of HBB than the uncorrected cells. Song et al. (Stem Cells Dev. 2015 May 1; 24(9):1053-65. doi: 10.1089/scd.2014.0347. Epub iPSCs; gene-corrected cells exhibit normal karyotypes and full pluripotency as human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) showed no off-targeting effects. Then, Song et al. evaluated the differentiation efficiency of the gene-corrected 3-Thal iPSCs. Song et al. found that during hematopoietic differentiation, gene-corrected -Thal iPSCs showed an increased embryoid body ratio and various hematopoietic progenitor cell percentages. More importantly, the gene-corrected 3-Thal iPSC lines restored HBB expression and reduced reactive oxygen species production compared with the uncorrected group. Song et al.'s study suggested that hematopoietic differentiation efficiency of -Thal iPSCs was greatly improved once corrected by the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Similar methods may be performed utilizing the CRISPR-Cas systems described herein, e.g. systems comprising Cpf1 effector proteins. Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive genetic disease in which red blood cells become sickle-shaped. It is caused by a single base substitution in the -globin gene, which is located on the short arm of chromosome 11. As a result, valine is produced instead of glutamic acid causing the production of sickle hemoglobin (HbS). This results in the formation of a distorted shape of the erythrocytes. Due to this abnormal shape, small blood vessels can be blocked, causing serious damage to the bone, spleen and skin tissues. This may lead to episodes of pain, frequent infections, hand-foot syndrome or even multiple organ failure. The distorted erythrocytes are also more susceptible to hemolysis, which leads to serious anemia. As in the case of -thalassaemia, sickle cell anemia can be corrected by modifying HSCs with the CRISPR-Cas system. The system allows the specific editing of the cell's genome by cutting its DNA and then letting it repair itself. The Cas protein is inserted and directed by a RNA guide to the mutated point and then it cuts the DNA at that point. Simultaneously, a healthy version of the sequence is inserted. This sequence is used by the cell's own repair system to fix the induced cut. In this way, the CRISPR-Cas allows the correction of the mutation in the previously obtained stem cells. With the knowledge in the art and the teachings in this disclosure, the skilled person can correct HSCs as to sickle cell anemia using a CRISPR-Cas system that targets and corrects the mutation (e.g., with a suitable HDR template that delivers a coding sequence for -globin, advantageously non-sickling -globin); specifically, the guide RNA can target mutation that give rise to sickle cell anemia, and the HDR can provide coding for proper expression of -globin. An guide RNA that targets the mutation-and-Cas protein containing particle is contacted with HSCs carrying the mutation. The particle also can contain a suitable HDR template to correct the mutation for proper expression of -globin; or the HSC can be contacted with a second particle or a vector that contains or delivers the HDR template. The so contacted cells can be administered; and optionally treated/expanded; cf Cartier. The HDR template can provide for the HSC to express an engineered -globin gene (e.g., A-T87Q), or -globin as in Xie. Williams, \"Broadening the Indications for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Genetic Therapies,\" Cell Stem Cell 13:263-264 (2013), incorporated herein by reference along with the documents it cites, as if set out in full, report lentivirus-mediated gene transfer into HSC/P cells from patients with the lysosomal storage disease metachromatic leukodystrophy disease (MLD), a genetic disease caused by deficiency of arylsulfatase A (ARSA), resulting in nerve demyelination; and lentivirus-mediated gene transfer into HSCs of patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (patients with defective WAS protein, an effector of the small GTPase CDCl42 that regulates cytoskeletal function in blood cell lineages and thus suffer from immune deficiency with recurrent infections, autoimmune symptoms, and thrombocytopenia with abnormally small and dysfunctional platelets leading to excessive bleeding and an increased risk of leukemia and lymphoma). In contrast to using lentivirus, with the knowledge in the art and the teachings in this disclosure, the skilled person can correct HSCs as to MLD (deficiency of arylsulfatase A (ARSA)) using a CRISPR-Cas system that targets and corrects the mutation (deficiency of arylsulfatase A (ARSA)) (e.g., with a suitable HDR template that delivers a coding sequence for ARSA); specifically, the guide RNA can target mutation that gives rise to MLD (deficient ARSA), and the HDR can provide coding for proper expression of ARSA. An guide RNA that targets the mutation-and-Cas protein containing particle is contacted with HSCs carrying the mutation. The particle also can contain a suitable HDR template to correct the mutation for proper expression of ARSA; or the HSC can be contacted with a second particle or a vector that contains or delivers the HDR template. The so contacted cells can be administered; and optionally treated/expanded; cf. Cartier. In contrast to using lentivirus, with the knowledge in the art and the teachings in this disclosure, the skilled person can correct HSCs as to WAS using a CRISPR-Cas system that targets and corrects the mutation (deficiency of WAS protein) (e.g., with a suitable HDR template that delivers a coding sequence for WAS protein); specifically, the guide RNA can target mutation that gives rise to WAS (deficient WAS protein), and the HDR can provide coding for proper expression of WAS protein. An guide RNA that targets the mutation-and-Cpf1 protein containing particle is contacted with HSCs carrying the mutation. The particle also can contain a suitable HDR template to correct the mutation for proper expression of WAS protein; or the HSC can be contacted with a second particle or a vector that contains or delivers the HDR template. The so contacted cells can be administered; and optionally treated/expanded; cf. Cartier. Watts, Therapy\" Cytotherapy 13(10):1164-1171. doi:10.3109/14653249.2011.620748 (2011), incorporated herein by reference along with the documents it cites, as if set out in full, discusses hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy, e.g., virus-mediated HSC gene thereapy, as an highly attractive treatment option for many disorders including hematologic conditions, immunodeficiencies including HIV/AIDS, and other genetic disorders assigned to Cellectis, relates to CREI variants, wherein at least one of the two I-Crel monomers has at least two substitutions, one in each of the two functional subdomains of the LAGLIDADG (SEQ ID NO: 83) core domain situated respectively from positions 26 to 40 and 44 to 77 of I-Crel, said variant being able to cleave a DNA target sequence from the human interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain (IL2RG) gene also named common cytokine receptor gamma chain gene or gamma C gene. The target sequences identified in US Patent Publication Nos. 20110225664, 20110091441, 20100229252, 20090271881 and 20090222937 may be utilized for the nucleic acid-targeting system of the present invention. Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID) results from a defect in lymphocytes T maturation, always associated with a functional defect in lymphocytes B (Cavazzana-Calvo et al., Annu. Rev. Med., 2005, 56, 585-602; Fischer et al., Immunol. Rev., 2005, 203, 98-109). Overall incidence is estimated to 1 in 75 000 births. Patients with untreated SCID are subject to multiple opportunist micro-organism infections, and do generally not live beyond one year. SCID can be treated by allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transfer, from a familial donor. Histocompatibility with the donor can vary widely. In the case of Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) deficiency, one of the SCID forms, patients can be treated by injection of recombinant Adenosine Deaminase enzyme. Since the ADA gene has been shown to be mutated in SCID patients (Giblett et al., Lancet, 1972, 2, 1067-1069), several other genes involved in SCID have been identified (Cavazzana-Calvo et al., Annu. Rev. Med., 2005, 56, 585-602; Fischer et al., Immunol. Rev., 2005, 203, 98-109). There are four major causes for SCID: (i) the most frequent form of SCID, SCID-X1 (X-linked SCID or X-SCID), is caused by mutation in the IL2RG gene, resulting in the absence of mature T lymphocytes and NK cells. IL2RG encodes the gamma C protein (Noguchi, et al., Cell, 1993, 73, 147-157), a common component of at least five interleukin receptor complexes. These receptors activate several targets through the JAK3 kinase (Macchi et al., Nature, 1995, 377, 65-68), which inactivation results in the same syndrome as gamma C inactivation; (ii) mutation in the ADA gene results in a defect in purine metabolism that is lethal for lymphocyte precursors, which in turn results in the quasi absence of B, T and NK cells; (iii) V(D)J recombination is an essential step in the maturation of immunoglobulins and T lymphocytes receptors (TCRs). Mutations in Recombination Activating Gene 1 and 2 (RAGI and RAG2) and Artemis, three genes involved in this process, result in the absence of mature T and B lymphocytes; and (iv) Mutations in other genes such as CD45, involved in T cell specific signaling have also been reported, although they represent a minority of cases (Cavazzana-Calvo et al., Annu. Rev. Med., 2005, 56, 585-602; Fischer et al., Immunol. Rev., 2005, 203, 98-109). Since when their genetic bases have been identified, the different SCID forms have become a paradigm for gene therapy approaches (Fischer et al., Immunol. Rev., 2005, 203, 98-109) for two major reasons. First, as in all blood diseases, an ex vivo treatment can be envisioned. Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) can be recovered from bone marrow, and keep their pluripotent properties for a few cell divisions. Therefore, they can be treated in vitro, and then reinjected into the patient, where they repopulate the bone marrow. Second, since the maturation of lymphocytes is impaired in SCID patients, corrected cells have a selective advantage. Therefore, a small number of corrected cells can restore a functional immune system. This hypothesis was validated several times by (i) the partial restoration of immune functions associated with the reversion of mutations in SCID patients (Hirschhorn et al., Nat. Genet., 1996, 13, 290-295; Stephan et al., N. Engl. J. 1996, 335, 1563-1567; Bousso et al., Proc. Natl., Acad. Sci. 274-278; Wada et Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2001, 98, 8697-8702; Nishikomori et al., Blood, 2004, 103, 4565-4572), (ii) the correction of SCID-X1 deficiencies in vitro in hematopoietic cells (Candotti et al., Blood, 1996, 87, 3097-3102; Cavazzana-Calvo et al., Blood, 1996, Blood, 88, 3901-3909; Taylor et al., Blood, 1996, 87, 3103-3107; Hacein-Bey et al., Blood, 1998, 92, 4090-4097), (iii) the correction of SCID-X1 (Soudais et al., Blood, 2000, 95, 3071-3077; Tsai et al., Blood, 2002, 100, 72-79), JAK-3 (Bunting et al., Nat. Med., 1998, 4, 58-64; Bunting et al., Hum. Gene Ther., 2000, 11, 2353-2364) and RAG2 (Yates et al., Blood, 2002, 100, 3942-3949) deficiencies in vivo in animal models and (iv) by the result of gene therapy clinical trials (Cavazzana-Calvo et al., Science, 2000, 288, 669-672; Aiuti et al., Nat. Med., 2002; 8, 423-425; Gaspar et al., Lancet, 2004, 364, 2181-2187). US Patent Publication No. 20110182867 assigned to the Children's Medical Center Corporation and the President and Fellows of Harvard College relates to methods and uses of modulating fetal hemoglobin expression (HbF) in a hematopoietic progenitor cells via inhibitors of BCL11A expression or activity, such as RNAi and antibodies. The targets disclosed in US Patent Publication No. 20110182867, such as BCL11A, may be targeted by the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention for modulating fetal hemoglobin expression.

With the knowledge in the art and the teachings in this disclosure, the skilled person can correct HSCs as to a genetic hematologic disorder, e.g., -Thalassemia, Hemophilia, or a genetic lysosomal storage disease. HSC\u2014Delivery to and Editing of Hematopoetic Stem Cells; and Particular Conditions. The term \"Hematopoietic Stem Cell\" or \"HSC\" is meant to include broadly those cells considered to be an HSC, e.g., blood cells that give rise to all the other blood cells and are derived from mesoderm; located in the red bone marrow, which is contained in the core of most bones. HSCs of the invention include cells having a phenotype of hematopoietic stem cells, identified by small size, lack of lineage (lin) markers, and markers that belong to the cluster of differentiation series, like: for stem cell factor. Hematopoietic stem cells are negative for the markers that are used for detection of lineage commitment, and are, thus, called Lin-; and, during their purification by FACS, a number of up to 14 different mature blood-lineage markers, e.g., CD13 & CD33 for myeloid, in embodiments discussed herein, the HSCs can be CD34+ cells. HSCs can also be hematopoietic stem cells that are CD34-/CD38-. Stem cells that may lack c-kit on the cell surface that are considered in the art as HSCs are within the ambit of the invention, as well as CD133+ cells likewise considered HSCs in the art. The CRISPR-Cas (eg Cpf1) system may be engineered to target genetic loci in HSCs. Cas (eg Cpf1) protein, advantageously codon-optimized for a eukaryotic cell and especially a mammalian cell, e.g., a human cell, for instance, HSC, and sgRNA targeting a locus or loci in HSC, e.g., the gene EMX1, may be prepared. These may be delivered via particles. The particles may be formed by the Cas (eg Cpf1) protein and the gRNA being admixed. The gRNA and Cas (eg Cpf1) protein mixture may for example be admixed with a mixture comprising or consisting essentially of or consisting of surfactant, phospholipid, biodegradable polymer, lipoprotein and alcohol, whereby particles containing the gRNA and Cas (eg Cpf1) protein may be formed. The invention comprehends so making particles and particles from such a method as well as uses thereof. More generally, particles may be formed using an efficient process. First, Cas (eg Cpf1) protein and gRNA targeting the gene EMX1 or the control gene LacZ may be mixed together at a suitable, e.g., 3:1 to 1:3 or 2:1 to 1:2 or 1:1 molar ratio, at a suitable temperature, e.g., 15-30 C, e.g., 20-25 C, e.g., room temperature, for a suitable time, e.g., 15-45, such as 30 minutes, advantageously in sterile, nuclease free buffer, e.g., 1\u00d7PBS. Separately, particle components such as or comprising: a surfactant, cationic lipid, e.g., 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP); dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC); biodegradable polymer, such as an ethylene-glycol polymer or PEG, and a lipoprotein, such as a low-density lipoprotein, e.g., cholesterol may be dissolved in an alcohol, advantageously a C1-6 alkyl alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, e.g., 100% ethanol. The two solutions may be mixed together to form particles containing the Cas (eg Cpf1)-gRNA complexes. In certain embodiments the particle can contain an HDR template. That can be a particle co-administered with gRNA+Cas (eg Cpf1) protein-containing particle, or i.e., in an HSC with an gRNA+Cas (eg Cpf1) protein-containing particle, the HSC is contacted with a particle containing an HDR template; or the HSC is contacted with a particle containing all of the gRNA, Cas (eg Cpf1) and the HDR template. The HDR template can be administered by a separate vector, whereby in a first instance the particle penetrates an HSC cell and the separate vector also penetrates the cell, wherein the HSC genome is modified by the gRNA+Cas (eg Cpf1) and the HDR template is also present, whereby a genomic loci is modified by the HDR; for instance, this may result in correcting a mutation. After the particles form, HSCs in 96 well plates may be transfected with 15 ug Cas (eg Cpf1) protein per well. Three days after transfection, HSCs may be harvested, and the number of insertions and deletions (indels) at the EMX1 locus may be quantified. This illustrates how HSCs can be modified using CRISPR-Cas (eg Cpf1) targeting a genomic locus or loci of interest in the HSC. The HSCs that are to be modified can be in vivo, i.e., in an organism, for example a human or a non-human eukaryote, e.g., animal, such as fish, e.g., zebra fish, mammal, e.g., primate, e.g., ape, chimpanzee, macaque, rodent, e.g., mouse, rabbit, rat, canine or dog, livestock (cow/bovine, sheep/ovine, goat or pig), fowl or poultry, e.g., chicken. The HSCs that are to be modified can be in vitro, i.e., outside of such an organism. And, modified HSCs can be used ex vivo, i.e., one or more HSCs of such an organism can be obtained or isolated from the organism, optionally the HSC(s) can be expanded, the HSC(s) are modified by a composition comprising a CRISPR-Cas (eg Cpf1) that targets a genetic locus or loci in the HSC, e.g., by contacting the HSC(s) with the composition, for instance, wherein the composition comprises a particle containing the CRISPR enzyme and one or more gRNA that targets the genetic locus or loci in the HSC, such as a particle obtained or obtainable from admixing an gRNA and Cas (eg Cpf1) protein mixture with a mixture comprising or consisting essentially of or consisting of surfactant, phospholipid, biodegradable polymer, lipoprotein and alcohol (wherein one or more gRNA targets the genetic locus or loci in the HSC), optionally expanding the resultant modified HSCs and administering to the organism the resultant modified HSCs. In some instances the isolated or obtained HSCs can be from a first organism, such as an organism from a same species as a second organism, and the second organism can be the organism to which the resultant modified HSCs are administered, e.g., the first organism can be a donor (such as a relative as in a parent or sibling) to the second organism. Modified HSCs can have genetic modifications to address or alleviate or reduce symptoms of a disease or condition state of an individual or subject or patient. Modified HSCs, e.g., in the instance of a first organism donor to a second organism, can have genetic modifications to have the HSCs have one or more proteins e.g. surface markers or proteins more like that of the second organism. Modified HSCs can have genetic modifications to simulate a disease or condition state of an individual or subject or patient and would be re-administered to a non-human organism so as to prepare an animal model. Expansion of HSCs is within the ambit of the skilled person from this disclosure and knowledge in the art, see e.g., Lee, \"Improved ex vivo expansion of adult hematopoietic stem cells by overcoming CUL4-mediated degradation of HOXB4.\" Blood. 2013 May 16; 121(20):4082-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-09-455204. Epub 2013 Mar. 21. As indicated to improve activity, gRNA may be pre-complexed with the Cas (eg Cpf1) protein, before formulating the entire complex in a particle. Formulations may be made with a different molar ratio of different components known to promote delivery of nucleic acids into cells (e.g. 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP), 1,2-ditetradecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and cholesterol) For example DOTAP:DMPC:PEG:Cholesterol Molar Ratios may be DOTAP 100, DMPC 0, PEG 0, Cholesterol 0; or DOTAP 90, DMPC 0, PEG 10, Cholesterol 0; or DOTAP 90, DMPC 0, PEG 5, Cholesterol 5. DOTAP 100, DMPC 0, PEG 0, Cholesterol 0. The invention accordingly comprehends admixing gRNA, Cas (eg Cpf1) protein and components that form a particle; as well as particles from such admixing. In a preferred embodiment, particles containing the Cas (eg Cpf1)-gRNA complexes may be formed by mixing Cas (eg Cpf1) protein and one or more gRNAs together, preferably at a 1:1 molar ratio, enzyme: guide RNA. Separately, the different components known to promote delivery of nucleic acids (e.g. DOTAP, DMPC, PEG, and cholesterol) are dissolved, preferably in ethanol. The two solutions are mixed together to form particles containing the Cas (eg Cpf1)-gRNA complexes. After the particles are formed, Cas (eg Cpf1)-gRNA complexes may be transfected into cells (e.g. HSCs). Bar coding may be applied. The particles, the Cas-9 and/or the gRNA may be barcoded. The invention in an embodiment comprehends a method of preparing an gRNA-and-Cas (eg Cpf1) protein containing particle comprising admixing an gRNA and Cas (eg Cpf1) protein mixture with a mixture comprising or consisting essentially of or consisting of surfactant, phospholipid, biodegradable polymer, lipoprotein and alcohol. An embodiment comprehends an gRNA-and-Cas (eg Cpf1) protein containing particle from the method. The invention in an embodiment comprehends use of the particle in a method of modifying a genomic locus of interest, or an organism or a non-human organism by manipulation of a target sequence in a genomic locus of interest, comprising contacting a cell containing the genomic locus of interest with the particle wherein the gRNA targets the genomic locus of interest; or a method of modifying a genomic locus of interest, or an organism or a non-human organism by manipulation of a target sequence in a genomic locus of interest, comprising contacting a cell containing the genomic locus of interest with the particle wherein the gRNA targets the genomic locus of interest. In these embodiments, genomic locus interest is advantageously a genomic locus in an HSC. Considerations for Therapeutic Applications: A consideration in genome editing therapy is the choice of sequence-specific nuclease, such as a variant of a Cpf1 nuclease. Each nuclease variant may possess its own unique set of strengths and weaknesses, many of which may be balanced in the context of treatment to maximize therapeutic benefit. Thus far, two therapeutic editing approaches with nucleases have shown significant promise: gene disruption and gene correction. Gene disruption involves stimulation of NHEJ to create targeted indels in genetic elements, often resulting in loss of function mutations that are beneficial to patients. In contrast, gene correction uses HDR to directly reverse a disease causing mutation, restoring function while preserving physiological regulation of the corrected element. HDR may also be used to insert a therapeutic transgene into a defined 'safe harbor' locus in the genome to recover missing gene function. For a specific editing therapy to be efficacious, a sufficiently high level of modification may be achieved in target cell populations to reverse disease symptoms. This therapeutic modification 'threshold' is determined by the fitness of edited cells following treatment and the amount of gene product necessary to reverse symptoms. With regard to fitness, editing creates three potential outcomes for treated cells relative to their unedited counterparts: increased, neutral, or decreased fitness. In the case of increased fitness, for example in the treatment of SCID-X1, modified hematopoietic progenitor cells selectively expand relative to their unedited counterparts. SCID-X1 is a disease caused by mutations in the IL2RG gene, the function of which may be needed for proper development of the hematopoietic lymphocyte lineage [Leonard, W. J., et al. Immunological reviews 138, 61-86 (1994); Kaushansky, K. & Williams, W. J. Williams hematology, (McGraw-Hill Medical, New York, 2010)]. In clinical trials with patients who received viral gene therapy for SCID-X1, and a rare example of a spontaneous correction of SCID-X1 mutation, corrected hematopoietic progenitor cells may be able to overcome this developmental block and expand relative to their diseased counterparts to mediate therapy [Bousso, P., et al. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 97, 274-278 (2000); Hacein-Bey-Abina, S., et al. The New England journal of medicine 346, 1185-1193 (2002); Gaspar, H. B., et al. Lancet 364, 2181-2187 (2004)]. In this case, where edited cells possess a selective advantage, even low numbers of edited cells can be amplified through expansion, providing a therapeutic benefit to the patient. In contrast, editing for other hematopoietic diseases, like chronic granulomatous disorder (CGD), would induce no change in fitness for edited hematopoietic progenitor cells, increasing the therapeutic modification threshold. CGD is caused by mutations in genes encoding phagocytic oxidase proteins, which are normally used by neutrophils to generate reactive oxygen species that kill pathogens [Mukherjee, S. & Thrasher, A. J. Gene 525, 174-181 (2013)]. As dysfunction of these genes does not influence hematopoietic progenitor cell fitness or development, but only the ability of a mature hematopoietic cell type to fight infections, there would be likely no preferential expansion of edited cells in this disease. Indeed, no selective advantage for gene corrected cells in CGD has been observed in gene therapy trials, leading to difficulties with long-term cell engraftment [Malech, H. L., et al. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 94, 12133-12138 (1997); Kang, H. J., et al. Molecular therapy: the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy 19, 2092-2101 (2011)]. As such, significantly higher levels of editing would be required to treat diseases like CGD, where editing creates a neutral fitness advantage, relative to diseases where editing creates increased fitness for target cells. If editing imposes a fitness disadvantage, as would be the case for restoring function to a tumor suppressor gene in cancer cells, modified cells would be outcompeted by their diseased counterparts, causing the benefit of treatment to be low relative to editing rates. This latter class of diseases would be particularly difficult to treat with genome editing therapy. In addition to cell fitness, the amount of gene product necessary to treat disease also influences the minimal level of therapeutic genome editing that may be achieved to reverse symptoms. Haemophilia B is one disease where a small change in gene product levels can result in significant changes in clinical outcomes. This disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding factor IX, a protein normally secreted by the liver into the blood, where it functions as a component of the clotting cascade. Clinical severity of haemophilia B is related to the amount of factor IX activity. Whereas severe disease is associated with less than 1% of normal activity, milder forms of the diseases are associated with greater than 1% of factor IX activity [Kaushansky, K. & Williams, W. J. Williams hematology, (McGraw-Hill Medical, New York, 2010); Lofqvist, T., et al. Journal of internal medicine 241, 395-400 (1997)]. This suggests that editing therapies that can restore factor IX expression to even a small percentage of liver cells could have a large impact on clinical outcomes. A study using ZFNs to correct a mouse model of haemophilia B shortly after birth demonstrated that 3-7% correction was sufficient to reverse disease symptoms, providing preclinical evidence for this hypothesis [Li, H., et al. Nature 475, 217-221 (2011)]. Disorders where a small change in gene product levels can influence clinical outcomes and diseases where there is a fitness advantage for edited cells, are ideal targets for genome editing therapy, as the therapeutic modification threshold is low enough to permit a high chance of success given the current technology. Targeting these diseases has now resulted in successes with editing therapy at the preclinical level and a phase I clinical trial. Improvements in DSB repair pathway manipulation and nuclease delivery are needed to extend these promising results to diseases with a neutral fitness advantage for edited cells, or where larger amounts of gene product are needed for treatment. The Table below shows some examples of applications of genome editing to therapeutic models, and the references of the below Table and the documents cited in those references are hereby incorporated herein by reference as if set out in full. Addressing each of the conditions of the foreging table, using the CRISPR-Cas (eg Cpf1) system to target by either HDR-mediated correction of mutation, or HDR-mediated insertion of correct gene sequence, advantageously via a delivery system as herein, e.g., a particle delivery system, is within the ambit of the skilled person from this disclosure and the knowledge in the art. Thus, an embodiment comprehends contacting a Hemophilia protein containing targeting a genomic locus interest as to Hemophilia B, SCID (e.g., SCID-X1, ADA-SCID) or Hereditary tyrosinemia (e.g., as in Li, Genovese or Yin). The particle also can contain a suitable HDR template to correct the mutation; or the HSC can be contacted with a second particle or a vector that contains or delivers the HDR template. In this regard, it is mentioned that Haemophilia B is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding Factor IX, a crucial component of the clotting cascade. Recovering Factor IX activity to above 1% of its levels in severely affected individuals can transform the disease into a significantly milder form, as infusion of recombinant Factor IX into such patients prophylactically from a young age to achieve such levels largely ameliorates clinical complications. With the knowledge in the art and the teachings in this disclosure, the skilled person can correct HSCs as to Haemophilia B using a CRISPR-Cas (eg Cpf1) system that targets and corrects the mutation (X-linked recessive disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding Factor IX) (e.g., with a suitable HDR template that delivers a coding sequence for Factor IX); specifically, the gRNA can target mutation that give rise to Haemophilia B, and the HDR can provide coding for proper expression of Factor IX. An gRNA that targets the mutation-and-Cas (eg Cpf1) protein containing particle is contacted with HSCs carrying the mutation. The particle also can contain a suitable HDR template to correct the mutation for proper expression of Factor IX; or the HSC can be contacted with a second particle or a vector that contains or delivers the HDR template. The so contacted cells can be administered; and Stem Hematopoietic Stem Cell Gene Therapy in X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy,\" Brain Pathology 20 (2010) 857-862, incorporated herein by reference along with the documents it cites, as if set out in full, there is recognition that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was utilized to deliver normal lysosomal enzyme to the brain of a patient with Hurler's disease, and a discussion of HSC gene therapy to treat ALD. In two patients, peripheral CD34+cells were collected after granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization and transduced with an myeloproliferative sarcoma virus enhancer, negative control region deleted, d1587rev primer binding site substituted (MND)-ALD lentiviral vector. CD34+ cells from the patients were transduced with the MND-ALD vector during 16 h in the presence of cytokines at low concentrations. Transduced CD34+ cells were frozen after transduction to perform on 5% of cells various safety tests that included in particular three replication-competent lentivirus (RCL) assays. Transduction efficacy of CD34+ cells ranged 35% to 50% with a mean number of lentiviral integrated copy between 0.65 and 0.70. After the thawing of transduced CD34+ cells, the patients were reinfused with more CD34+ of the gene-corrected HSCs. Hematological recovery occurred between days 13 and 15 for the two patients. Nearly complete immunological recovery occurred at 12 months for the first patient, and at 9 months for the second patient. In contrast to using lentivirus, with the knowledge in the art and the teachings in this disclosure, the skilled person can correct HSCs as to ALD using a CRISPR-Cas (Cpf1) system that targets and corrects the mutation (e.g., with a suitable HDR template); specifically, the gRNA can target mutations in ABCD1, a gene located on the X chromosome that codes for ALD, a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein, and the HDR can provide coding for proper expression of the protein. An gRNA that targets the mutation-and-Cas (Cpf1) protein containing particle is contacted with HSCs, e.g., CD34+ cells carrying the mutation as in Cartier. The particle also can contain a suitable HDR template to correct the mutation for expression of the peroxisomal membrane transporter protein; or the HSC can be contacted with a second particle or a vector that contains or delivers the HDR template. The so contacted cells optioinally can be treated as in Cartier. The so contacted cells can be administered as in Cartier. Mention is made of WO 2015/148860, through the teachings herein the invention comprehends methods and materials of these documents applied in conjunction with the teachings herein. In an aspect of blood-related disease gene therapy, methods and compositions for treating beta thalassemia may be adapted to the CRISPR-Cas system of the present invention (see, e.g., WO 2015/148860). In an embodiment, WO 2015/148860 involves the treatment or prevention of beta thalassemia, or its symptoms, e.g., by altering the gene for B-cell CLL/lymphoma 11A (BCL11A). The protein that is involved in the regulation of globin gene expression. By altering the BCL11A gene (e.g., one or both alleles of the BCL11A gene), the levels of gamma globin can be increased. Gamma globin can replace beta globin in the hemoglobin complex and effectively carry oxygen to tissues, thereby ameliorating beta thalassemia disease phenotypes. Mention is also made of WO 2015/148863 and through the teachings herein the invention comprehends methods and materials of these documents which may be adapted to the CRISPR-Cas system of the present invention. In an aspect of treating and preventing sickle cell disease, which is an inherited hematologic disease, WO 2015/148863 comprehends altering the BCL11A gene. By altering the BCL11A gene (e.g., one or both alleles of the BCL11A gene), the levels of gamma globin can be increased. Gamma globin can replace beta globin in the hemoglobin complex and effectively carry oxygen to tissues, thereby ameliorating sickle cell disease phenotypes. In an aspect of the invention, methods and compositions which involve editing a target nucleic acid sequence, or modulating expression of a target nucleic acid sequence, and applications thereof in connection with cancer immunotherapy are comprehended by adapting the CRISPR-Cas system of the present invention. Reference is made to the application of gene therapy in WO 2015/161276 which involves methods and compositions which can be used to affect T-cell proliferation, survival and/or function by altering one or more T-cell expressed genes, e.g., one or more of FAS, BID, CTLA4, PDCD1, CBLB, PTPN6, TRAC and/or TRBC genes. In a related aspect, T-cell proliferation can be affected by altering one or more T-cell expressed genes, e.g., the CBLB and/or PTPN6 gene, FAS and/or BID gene, CTLA4 and/or PDCDI and/or TRAC and/or TRBC gene. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)19 T-cells exhibit anti-leukemic effects in patient malignancies. However, leukemia patients often do not have enough T-cells to collect, meaning that treatment may involve modified T cells from donors. Accordingly, there is interest in establishing a bank of donor T-cells. Qasim et al. (\"First Clinical Application of Talen Engineered Universal CAR19 T Cells in B-ALL\" ASH 57th Annual Meeting and Exposition, Dec. 5-8, 2015, Abstract 2046 (ash.confex.com/ash/2015/webprogram/Paper81653.html published online November 2015) discusses modifying CAR19 T cells to eliminate the risk of graft-versus-host disease through the disruption of T-cell receptor expression and CD52 targeting. Furthermore, CD52 cells were targeted such that they became insensitive to Alemtuzumab, and thus allowed Alemtuzumab to prevent host-mediated rejection of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatched CAR19 T-cells. Investigators used third lentiviral CAR19 (CD19 scFv-4-1BB-CD3Q) linked then two pairs of TALEN mRNA for multiplex targeting for both the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha constant chain locus and the CD52 gene locus. Cells which were still expressing TCR following ex vivo expansion were depleted using CliniMacs / TCR depletion, yielding a T-cell product (UCART19) with <1% TCR expression, 85% of which expressed CAR19, and 64% becoming CD52 negative. The modified CAR19 T cells were administered to treat a patient's relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The teachings provided herein provide effective methods for providing modified hematopoietic stem cells and progeny thereof, including but not limited to cells of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages of blood, including T neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, erythrocytes, dendritic cells, and megakaryocytes or platelets, and natural killer cells and their precursors and progenitors. Such cells can be modified by knocking out, knocking in, or otherwise modulating targets, for example to remove or modulate CD52 as described above, and other targets, such as, without limitation, CXCR4, and PD-1. Thus compositions, cells, and method of the invention can be used to modulate immune responses and to treat, without limitation, malignancies, viral infections, and immune disorders, in conjunction with modification of administration of T cells or other cells to patients. Mention is made of WO 2015/148670 and through the teachings herein the invention comprehends methods and materials of this document applied in conjunction with the teachings herein. In an aspect of gene therapy, methods and compositions for editing of a target sequence related to or in connection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) are comprehended. In a related aspect, the invention described herein comprehends prevention and treatment of HIV infection and AIDS, by introducing one or more mutations in the gene for C\u2014C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5). The CCR5 CMKBR5, IDDM22, aspect, the invention described herein comprehends provide for prevention or reduction of HIV infection and/or prevention or reduction of the ability for HIV to enter host cells, e.g., in subjects who are already infected. Exemplary host cells for HIV include, but are not limited to, CD4 cells, T cells, gut associated lymphatic tissue (GALT), macrophages, dendritic cells, myeloid precursor cell, and microglia. Viral entry into the host cells may need interaction of the viral glycoproteins gp41 and gp120 with both the CD4 receptor and a co-receptor, e.g., CCR5. If a co-receptor, e.g., CCR5, is not present on the surface of the host cells, the virus cannot bind and enter the host cells. The progress of the disease is thus impeded. By knocking out or knocking down CCR5 in the host cells, e.g., by introducing a protective mutation (such as a CCR5 delta 32 mutation), entry of the HIV virus into the host cells is prevented. X-linked Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a hereditary disorder of host defense due to absent or decreased activity of phagocyte NADPH oxidase. Using a CRISPR-Cas (Cpf1) system that targets and corrects the mutation (absent or decreased activity of phagocyte NADPH oxidase) (e.g., with a suitable HDR template that delivers a coding sequence for phagocyte NADPH oxidase); specifically, the gRNA can target mutation that gives rise to CGD (deficient phagocyte NADPH oxidase), and the HDR can provide for proper expression of phagocyte NADPH oxidase. An gRNA that targets the mutation-and-Cas (Cpf1) protein containing particle is contacted with HSCs carrying the mutation. The particle also can contain a suitable HDR template to correct the mutation for proper expression of phagocyte NADPH oxidase; or the HSC can be contacted with a second particle or a vector that contains or delivers the HDR template. The so contacted cells can be administered; and optionally treated/expanded; cf. Cartier. Fanconi Fanconi anemia. Proteins produced from these genes are involved in a cell process known as the FA pathway. The FA pathway is turned on (activated) when the process of making new copies of DNA, called DNA replication, is blocked due to DNA damage. The FA pathway sends certain proteins to the area of damage, which trigger DNA repair so DNA replication can continue. The FA pathway is particularly responsive to a certain type of DNA damage known as interstrand cross-links (ICLs). ICLs occur when two DNA building blocks (nucleotides) on opposite strands of DNA are abnormally attached or linked together, which stops the process of DNA replication. ICLs can be caused by a buildup of toxic substances produced in the body or by treatment with certain cancer therapy drugs. Eight proteins associated with Fanconi anemia group together to form a complex known as the FA core complex. The FA core complex activates two proteins, called FANCD2 and FANCI. The activation of these two proteins brings DNA repair proteins to the area of the ICL so the cross-link can be removed and DNA replication can continue. the FA core complex. More in particular, the FA core complex is a nuclear multiprotein complex consisting ligase and mediates the activation of the ID complex, which is a heterodimer composed of FANCD2 and FANCI. Once monoubiquitinated, it interacts with classical tumor suppressors downstream of the FA pathway including FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCN/PALB2, FANCJ/BRIP1, and FANCO/Rad51C and thereby contributes to DNA repair via homologous recombination (HR). Eighty to 90 percent of FA cases are due to mutations in one of three genes, FANCA, FANCC, and FANCG. These genes provide instructions for producing components of the FA core complex. Mutations in such genes associated with the FA core complex will cause the complex to be nonfunctional and disrupt the entire FA pathway. As a result, DNA damage is not repaired efficiently and ICLs build up over time. Geiselhart, \"Review Article, Disrupted Signaling through the Fanconi Anemia Pathway Leads to Dysfunctional Hematopoietic Stem Cell Biology: Underlying Mechanisms and Potential Therapeutic Strategies,\" Anemia Volume 2012 (2012), Article ID 265790, dx.doi.org/10.1155/2012/265790 discussed FA and an animal experiment involving intrafemoral injection of a lentivirus encoding the FANCC gene resulting in correction of HSCs in vivo. Using a CRISPR-Cas (Cpf1) system that targets and one or more of the mutations associated with FA, for instance a CRISPR-Cas (Cpf1) system having gRNA(s) and HDR template(s) that respectively targets one or more of the mutations of FANCA, FANCC, or FANCG that give rise to FA and provide corrective expression of one or more of FANCA, FANCC or FANCG; e.g., the gRNA can target a mutation as to FANCC, and the HDR can provide coding for proper expression of FANCC. An gRNA that targets the mutation(s) (e.g., one or more involved in FA, such as mutation(s) as to any one or more of FANCA, FANCC or FANCG)-and-Cas (Cpf1) protein containing particle is contacted with HSCs carrying the mutation(s). The particle also can contain a suitable HDR template(s) to correct the mutation for proper expression of one or more of the proteins involved in FA, such as any one or more of FANCA, FANCC or FANCG; or the HSC can be contacted with a second particle or a vector that contains or delivers the HDR template. The so contacted cells can be administered; and optionally treated/expanded; cf. Cartier. The particle in the herein discussion (e.g., as to containing gRNA(s) and Cas (Cpf1), optionally HDR template(s), genetic storage disease) is advantageously obtained or obtainable from admixing an gRNA(s) and Cas (Cpf1) protein mixture (optionally containing HDR template(s) or such mixture only containing HDR template(s) when separate particles as to template(s) is desired) with a mixture comprising or consisting essentially of or consisting of surfactant, phospholipid, biodegradable polymer, lipoprotein and alcohol (wherein one or more gRNA targets the genetic locus or loci in the HSC). Indeed, the invention is especially suited for treating hematopoietic genetic disorders with genome editing, and immunodeficiency disorders, such as genetic immunodeficiency disorders, especially through using the particle technology herein-discussed. Genetic immunodeficiencies are diseases where genome editing interventions of the instant invention can successful. The reasons include: Hematopoietic cells, of which immune cells are a subset, are therapeutically accessible. They can be removed from the body and transplanted autologously or allogenically. Further, certain genetic immunodeficiencies, e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), create a proliferative disadvantage for immune cells. Correction of genetic lesions causing SCID by rare, spontaneous 'reverse' mutations indicates that correcting even one lymphocyte progenitor may be sufficient to recover immune function in See Bousso, P., et al. Diversity, functionality, and stability of the T cell repertoire derived in vivo from a single human T cell precursor. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 97, 274-278 (2000). The selective advantage for edited cells allows for even low levels of editing to result in a therapeutic effect. This effect of the instant invention can be seen in SCID, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome, and the other conditions mentioned herein, including other genetic hematopoietic disorders such as alpha- and beta-thalassemia, where hemoglobin deficiencies negatively affect the fitness of erythroid progenitors. The activity of NHEJ and HDR DSB repair varies significantly by cell type and cell state. NHEJ is not highly regulated by the cell cycle and is efficient across cell types, allowing for high levels of gene disruption in accessible target cell populations. In contrast, HDR acts primarily during S/G2 phase, and is therefore restricted to cells that are actively dividing, limiting treatments that require precise genome modifications to mitotic cells [Ciccia, A. & Elledge, S. J. Molecular cell 40, 179-204 (2010); Chapman, J. R., et al. Molecular cell 47, 497-510 (2012)]. The efficiency of correction via HDR may be controlled by the epigenetic state or sequence of the targeted locus, or the specific repair template configuration (single vs. double stranded, long vs. short homology arms) used [Hacein-Bey-Abina, S., et al. The New England journal of medicine 346, 1185-1193 (2002); Gaspar, H. B., et al. Lancet Beumer, K. J., et al. relative activity of NHEJ and HDR machineries in target cells may also affect gene correction efficiency, as these pathways may compete to resolve DSBs [Beumer, K. J., et al. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 105, 19821-19826 (2008)]. HDR also imposes a delivery challenge not seen with NHEJ strategies, as it may need the concurrent delivery of nucleases and repair templates. In practice, these constraints have so far led to low levels of HDR in therapeutically relevant cell types. Clinical translation has therefore largely focused on NHEJ strategies to treat disease, although proof-of-concept preclinical HDR treatments have now been described for mouse models of haemophilia B and hereditary tyrosinemia [Li, H., et al. Nature 475, 217-221 (2011); Yin, H., et al. Nature biotechnology 32, 551-553 (2014)]. Any given genome editing application may comprise combinations of proteins, small RNA molecules, and/or repair templates, making delivery of these multiple parts substantially more challenging than small molecule therapeutics. Two main strategies for delivery of genome editing tools have been developed: ex vivo and in vivo. In ex vivo treatments, diseased cells are removed from the body, edited and then transplanted back into the patient. Ex vivo editing has the advantage of allowing the target cell population to be well defined and the specific dosage of therapeutic molecules delivered to cells to be specified. The latter consideration may be particularly important when off-target modifications are a concern, as titrating the amount of nuclease may decrease such mutations (Hsu et al., 2013). Another advantage of ex vivo approaches is the typically high editing rates that can be achieved, due to the development of efficient delivery systems for proteins and nucleic acids into cells in culture for research and gene therapy applications. There may be drawbacks with ex vivo approaches that limit application to a small number of diseases. For instance, target cells may be capable of surviving manipulation outside the body. For many tissues, like the brain, culturing cells outside the body is a major challenge, because cells either fail to survive, or lose properties necessary for their function in vivo. Thus, in view of this disclosure and the knowledge in the art, ex vivo therapy as to tissues with adult stem cell populations amenable to ex vivo culture and manipulation, such as the hematopoietic system, by the CRISPR-Cas (Cpf1) system are enabled. [Bunn, H. F. & Aster, J. Pathophysiology of blood disorders, (McGraw-Hill, New York, 2011)] In vivo genome editing involves direct delivery of editing systems to cell types in their native tissues. In vivo editing allows diseases in which the affected cell population is not amenable to ex vivo manipulation to be treated. Furthermore, delivering nucleases to cells in situ allows for the treatment of multiple tissue and cell types. These properties probably allow in vivo treatment to be applied to a wider range of diseases than ex vivo therapies. To date, in vivo editing has largely been achieved through the use of viral vectors with defined, tissue-specific tropism. Such vectors are currently limited in terms of cargo carrying capacity and tropism, restricting this mode of therapy to organ systems where transduction with clinically useful vectors is efficient, such as the liver, muscle and eye [Kotterman, M. A. & Schaffer, D. V. Nature reviews. Genetics 15, 445-451 (2014); Nguyen, T. H. & Ferry, N. Gene therapy 11 Suppl 1, S76-84 (2004); Boye, S. E., et al. Molecular therapy the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy 21, 509-519 (2013)]. A potential barrier for in vivo delivery is the immune response that may be created in response to the large amounts of virus necessary for treatment, but this phenomenon is not unique to genome editing and is observed with other virus based gene therapies [Bessis, N., et al. Gene therapy 11 Suppl 1, S10-17 (2004)]. It is also possible that peptides from editing nucleases themselves are presented on MHC Class I molecules to stimulate an immune response, although there is little evidence to support this happening at the preclinical level. Another major difficulty with this mode of therapy is controlling the distribution and consequently the dosage of genome editing nucleases in vivo, leading to off-target mutation profiles that may be difficult to predict. However, in view of this disclosure and the knowledge in the art, including the use of virus- and particle-based therapies being used in the treatment of cancers, in vivo modification of HSCs, for instance by delivery by either particle or virus, is within the ambit of the skilled person. Ex Vivo Editing Therapy: The long standing clinical expertise with the purification, culture and transplantation of hematopoietic cells has made diseases affecting the blood system such as SCID, Fanconi anemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and sickle cell anemia the focus of ex vivo editing therapy. Another reason to focus on hematopoietic cells is that, thanks to previous efforts to design gene therapy for blood disorders, delivery systems of relatively high efficiency already exist. With these advantages, this mode of therapy can be applied to diseases where edited cells possess a fitness advantage, so that a small number of engrafted, edited cells can expand and treat disease. One such disease is HIV, where infection results in a fitness disadvantage to CD4+ T cells. Ex vivo editing therapy has been recently extended to include gene correction strategies. The barriers to HDR ex vivo were overcome in a recent paper from Genovese and colleagues, who achieved gene correction of a mutated IL2RG gene in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) obtained from a patient suffering from SCID-X1 [Genovese, P., et al. Nature 510, 235-240 (2014)]. Genovese et. al. accomplished gene correction in HSCs using a multimodal strategy. First, HSCs were transduced using integration-deficient lentivirus containing an HDR template encoding a therapeutic cDNA for IL2RG. Following transduction, cells were electroporated with mRNA encoding ZFNs targeting a mutational hotspot in IL2RG to stimulate HDR based gene correction. To increase HDR rates, culture conditions were optimized with small molecules to encourage HSC division. With optimized culture conditions, nucleases and HDR templates, gene corrected HSCs from the SCID-X1 patient were obtained in culture at therapeutically relevant rates. HSCs from unaffected individuals that underwent the same gene correction procedure could sustain long-term hematopoiesis in mice, the gold standard for HSC function. HSCs are capable of giving rise to all hematopoietic cell types and can be autologously transplanted, making them an extremely valuable cell population for all hematopoietic genetic disorders [Weissman, I. L. & Shizuru, J. A. Blood 112, 3543-3553 (2008)]. Gene corrected HSCs could, in principle, be used to treat a wide range of genetic blood disorders making this study an exciting breakthrough for therapeutic genome editing. In Vivo Editing Therapy: In vivo editing can be used advantageously from this disclosure and the knowledge in the art. For organ systems where delivery is efficient, there have already been a number of exciting preclinical therapeutic successes. The first example of successful in vivo editing therapy was demonstrated in a mouse model of haemophilia B [Li, H., et al. Nature 475, 217-221 (2011)]. As noted earlier, Haemophilia B is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding Factor IX, a crucial component of the clotting cascade. Recovering Factor IX activity to above 1% of its levels in severely affected individuals can transform the disease into a significantly milder form, as infusion of recombinant Factor IX into such patients prophylactically from a young age to achieve such levels largely ameliorates clinical complications [Lofqvist, T., et al. Journal of internal medicine 241, 395-400 (1997)]. Thus, only low levels of HDR gene correction are necessary to change clinical outcomes for patients. In addition, Factor IX is synthesized and secreted by the liver, an organ that can be transduced efficiently by viral vectors encoding editing systems. Using hepatotropic adeno-associated viral (AAV) serotypes encoding ZFNs and a corrective HDR template, up to 7% gene correction of a mutated, humanized Factor IX gene in the murine liver was achieved [Li, H., et al. Nature 475, 217-221 (2011)]. This resulted in improvement of clot formation kinetics, a measure of the function of the clotting cascade, demonstrating for the first time that in vivo editing therapy is not only feasible, but also efficacious. As discussed herein, the skilled person is positioned from the teachings herein and the knowledge in the art, e.g., Li to address Haemophilia B with a particle-containing HDR template and a CRISPR-Cas (Cpf1) system that targets the mutation of the X-linked recessive disorder to reverse the loss-of-function mutation. Building on this study, other groups have recently used in vivo genome editing of the liver with CRISPR-Cas to successfully treat a mouse model of hereditary tyrosinemia and to create mutations that provide protection against cardiovascular disease. These two distinct applications demonstrate the versatility of this approach for disorders that involve hepatic dysfunction [Yin, H., et al. Nature biotechnology 32, 551-553 (2014); Ding, Q., et al. Circulation research 115, 488-492 (2014)]. Application of in vivo editing to other organ systems are necessary to prove that this strategy is widely applicable. Currently, efforts to optimize both viral and non-viral vectors are underway to expand the range of disorders that can be treated with this mode of therapy [Kotterman, M. A. & Schaffer, D. V. Nature reviews. Genetics 15, 445-451 (2014); Yin, H., et al. Nature reviews. Genetics 15, 541-555 (2014)]. As discussed herein, the skilled person is positioned from the teachings herein and the knowledge in the art, e.g., Yin to address hereditary tyrosinemia with a particle-containing HDR template and a CRISPR-Cas (Cpf1) system that targets the mutation. Targeted deletion, therapeutic applications: Targeted deletion of genes may be preferred. Preferred are, therefore, genes involved in immunodeficiency disorder, hematologic condition, or genetic lysosomal storage metabolic disorders, genes encoding mis-folded proteins involved in diseases, genes leading to loss-of-function involved in diseases; generally, mutations that can be targeted in an HSC, using any herein-discussed delivery system, with the particle system considered advantageous. In the present invention, the immunogenicity of the CRISPR enzyme in particular may be reduced following the approach first set out in Tangri et al with respect to erythropoietin and subsequently developed. Accordingly, directed evolution or rational design may be used to reduce the immunogenicity of the CRISPR enzyme (for instance a Cpf1) in the host species (human or other species). Genome editing: The CRISPR/Cas (Cpf1) systems of the present invention can be used to correct genetic mutations that were previously attempted with limited success using TALEN and ZFN and lentiviruses, including as herein discussed; see also WO2013163628.Treating Disease of the Brain, Central Nervous and Immune Systems The present invention also contemplates delivering the CRISPR-Cas system to the brain or neurons. For example, RNA interference (RNAi) offers therapeutic potential for this disorder by reducing the expression of HTT, the disease-causing gene of Huntington's disease (see, e.g., McBride et al., Molecular Therapy vol. 19 no. 12 Dec. 2011, pp. 2152-2162), therefore Applicant postulates that it may be used/and or adapted to the CRISPR-Cas system. The CRISPR-Cas system may be generated using an algorithm to reduce the off-targeting potential of antisense sequences. The CRISPR-Cas sequences may target either a sequence in exon 52 of mouse, rhesus or human huntingtin and expressed in a viral vector, such as AAV. Animals, including humans, may be injected with about three microinjections per hemisphere (six injections total): the first 1 mm rostral to the anterior commissure (12 l) and the two remaining injections (12 l and 10 l, respectively) spaced 3 and 6 mm caudal to the first injection with 1e12 vg/ml of AAV at a rate of about 1 l/minute, and the needle was left in place for an additional 5 minutes to allow the injectate to diffuse from the needle tip. DiFiglia et al. (PNAS, Oct. 23, 2007, vol. 104, no. 43, 17204-17209) observed that single administration into the adult striatum of an siRNA targeting Htt can silence mutant Htt, attenuate neuronal pathology, and delay the abnormal behavioral phenotype observed in a rapid-onset, viral transgenic mouse model of HD. DiFiglia injected mice intrastriatally with 2 l of Cy3-labeled cc-siRNA-Htt or unconjugated siRNA-Htt at 10 M. A similar dosage of CRISPR Cas targeted to Htt may be contemplated for humans in the present invention, for example, about 5-10 ml of 10 M CRISPR Cas targeted to Htt may be injected intrastriatally. In another example, Boudreau et al. (Molecular Therapy vol. 17 no. 6 Jun. 2009) injects 5 l of recombinant AAV serotype 2/1 vectors expressing htt-specific RNAi virus (at 4\u00d71012 viral genomes/ml) into the straiatum. A similar dosage of CRISPR Cas targeted to Htt may be contemplated for humans in the present invention, for example, about 10-20 ml of 4\u00d71012 viral genomes/ml) CRISPR Cas targeted to Htt may be injected intrastriatally. In another example, a CRISPR Cas targetd to HTT may be administered continuously (see, e.g., Yu et al., Cell 150, 895-908, Aug. 31, 2012). Yu et al. utilizes osmotic pumps delivering 0.25 ml/hr (Model 2004) to deliver 300 mg/day of ss-siRNA or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma Aldrich) for 28 days, and pumps designed to deliver 0.5 l/hr (Model 2002) were used to deliver 75 mg/day of the positive control MOE ASO for 14 days. Pumps (Durect Corporation) were filled with ss-siRNA or MOE diluted in sterile PBS and then incubated at 37 C for 24 or 48 (Model 2004) hours prior to implantation. Mice were anesthetized with 2.5% isofluorane, and a midline incision was made at the base of the skull. Using stereotaxic guides, a cannula was implanted into the right lateral ventricle and secured with Loctite adhesive. A catheter attached to an Alzet osmotic mini pump was attached to the cannula, and the pump was placed subcutaneously in the midscapular area. The incision was closed with 5.0 nylon sutures. A similar dosage of CRISPR Cas targeted to Htt may be contemplated for humans in the present invention, for example, about 500 to 1000 g/day CRISPR Cas targeted to Htt may be administered. In another example of continuous infusion, Stiles et al. (Experimental Neurology 233 (2012) 463-471) implanted an intraparenchymal catheter with a titanium needle tip into the right putamen. The catheter was connected to a SynchroMed\u00ae II Pump (Medtronic Neurological, Minneapolis, Minn.) subcutaneously implanted in the abdomen. After a 7 day infusion of phosphate buffered saline at 6 L/day, pumps were re-filled with test article and programmed for continuous delivery for 7 days. About 2.3 to 11.52 mg/d of siRNA were infused at varying infusion rates of about 0.1 to 0.5 L/min. A similar dosage of CRISPR Cas targeted to Htt may be contemplated for humans in the present invention, for example, about 20 to 200 mg/day CRISPR Cas targeted to Htt may be administered. In another example, the methods of US Patent Publication No. 20130253040 assigned to Sangamo may also be also be adapted from TALES to the nucleic acid-targeting system of the present invention for treating Huntington's Disease. In another example, the methods of US Patent Publication No. 20130253040 (WO2013130824) assigned to Sangamo may also be also be adapted from TALES to the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention for treating Huntington's Disease. WO2015089354 A1 in the name of The Broad Institute et al., hereby incorporated by reference, describes a targets for Huntington's Disease (HP). Possible target genes of CRISPR complex RCOR1; PRKCZ; HDAC4; and TGM2 may as targets for Huntington's Disease in some embodiments of the present invention. Other trinucleotide repeat disorders. These may include any of the following: Category I includes Huntington's disease (HD) and the spinocerebellar ataxias; Category II expansions are phenotypically diverse with heterogeneous expansions that are generally small in magnitude, but also found in the exons of genes; and Category III includes fragile X syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, two of the spinocerebellar ataxias, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and Friedreich's ataxia. A further aspect of the invention relates to utilizing the CRISPR-Cas system for correcting defects in the EMP2A and EMP2B genes that have been identified to be associated with Lafora disease. Lafora disease is an autosomal recessive condition which is characterized by progressive myoclonus epilepsy which may start as epileptic seizures in adolescence. A few cases of the disease may be caused by mutations in genes yet to be identified. The disease causes seizures, muscle spasms, difficulty walking, dementia, and eventually death. There is currently no therapy that has proven effective against disease progression. Other genetic abnormalities associated with epilepsy may also be targeted by the CRISPR-Cas system and the underlying genetics is further described in Genetics of Epilepsy and Genetic Epilepsies, edited by Giuliano Avanzini, Jeffrey L. Noebels, Mariani Foundation Paediatric Neurology: 20; 2009). The methods of US Patent Publication No. 20110158957 assigned to Sangamo BioSciences, Inc. involved in inactivating T cell receptor (TCR) genes may also be modified to the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention. In another example, the methods of US Patent Publication No. 20100311124 assigned to Sangamo BioSciences, Inc. and US Patent Publication No. 20110225664 assigned to Cellectis, which are both involved in inactivating glutamine synthetase gene expression genes may also be modified to the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention. Delivery options for the brain include encapsulation of CRISPR enzyme and guide RNA in the form of either DNA or RNA into liposomes and conjugating to molecular Trojan horses for trans-blood brain barrier (BBB) delivery. Molecular Trojan horses have been shown to be effective for delivery of B-gal expression vectors into the brain of non-human primates. The same approach can be used to delivery vectors containing CRISPR enzyme and guide RNA. For instance, Xia C F and Boado R J, Pardridge W M (\"Antibody-mediated targeting of siRNA via the human 2009 May-June; 6(3):747-51. delivery of short interfering RNA (siRNA) to cells in culture, and in vivo, is possible with combined use of a receptor-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) and avidin-biotin technology. The authors also report that because the bond between the targeting mAb and the siRNA is stable with avidin-biotin technology, and RNAi effects at distant sites such as brain are observed in vivo following an intravenous administration of the targeted siRNA. Zhang et al. (Mol Ther. 2003 January; 7(1):11-8.)) describe how expression plasmids encoding reporters such as luciferase were encapsulated in the interior of an \"artificial virus\" comprised of an 85 nm pegylated immunoliposome, which was targeted to the rhesus monkey brain in vivo with a monoclonal antibody (MAb) to the human insulin receptor (HIR). The HIRMAb enables the liposome carrying the exogenous gene to undergo transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier and endocytosis across the neuronal plasma membrane following intravenous injection. The level of luciferase gene expression in the brain was 50-fold higher in the rhesus monkey as compared to the rat. Widespread neuronal expression of the beta-galactosidase gene in primate brain was demonstrated by both histochemistry and confocal microscopy. The authors indicate that this approach makes feasible reversible adult transgenics in 24 hours. Accordingly, the use of immunoliposome is preferred. These may be used in conjunction with antibodies to target specific tissues or cell surface proteins.Alzheimer's Disease US Patent Publication No. 20110023153, describes use of zinc finger nucleases to genetically modify cells, animals and proteins associated with Alzheimer's Disease. Once modified cells and animals may be further tested using known methods to study the effects of the targeted mutations on the development and/or progression of AD using measures commonly used in the study of AD\u2014such as, without limitation, learning and memory, anxiety, depression, addiction, and sensory motor functions as well as assays that measure behavioral, functional, pathological, metaboloic and biochemical function. The present disclosure comprises editing of any chromosomal sequences that encode proteins associated with AD. The AD-related proteins are typically selected based on an experimental association of the AD-related protein to an AD disorder. For example, the production rate or circulating concentration of an AD-related protein may be elevated or depressed in a population having an AD disorder relative to a population lacking the AD disorder. Differences in protein levels may be assessed using proteomic techniques including but not limited to Western blot, immunohistochemical staining, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and mass spectrometry. Alternatively, the AD-related proteins may be identified by obtaining gene expression profiles of the genes encoding the proteins using genomic techniques including but not limited to DNA microarray analysis, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). Examples of Alzheimer's disease associated proteins may include the very low density lipoprotein receptor protein (VLDLR) encoded by the VLDLR gene, the ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 1 (UBA1) the NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 catalytic subunit protein (UBE1C) encoded by the UBA3 gene, for example. By way of non-limiting example, proteins associated with AD include but are not limited to the proteins listed as follows: Chromosomal Sequence Encoded Protein aquaporin 1 protein (AQP1) BIN1 Myc family 4, member e (CLEC4E) clusterin protein (also known as apoplipoprotein J) CR1 Erythrocyte complement receptor 1 (CR1, also known as CD35, C3b/C4b receptor and immune adherence CR1L Erythrocyte complement also known as CD89) FCGR3B Fc fragment protein CD181) 8 receptor, beta 1 A protein (PTPRA) RALGPS2 Ral GEF with PH domain and SH3 binding motif 2 (RALGPS2) RGSL2 regulator of G-protein signaling factor A Tumor Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 10C (TNFRSF10C) TNFSF10 receptor protein (VLDLR). In exemplary embodiments, the proteins associated with AD whose chromosomal sequence is edited may be the very low density lipoprotein receptor protein (VLDLR) encoded by the VLDLR gene, the ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 1 (UBA1) encoded the the NEDD8-activating enzyme El catalytic subunit protein (UBEIC) encoded by the UBA3 gene, the aquaporin 1 protein (AQP1) encoded by the AQP1 gene, the ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 protein by the UCHL3 gene, the ubiquitin B protein (UBB) encoded by the UBB gene, the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) encoded by the MAPT gene, the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type A protein (PTPRA) encoded by the PTPRA gene, the phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) encoded by the PICALM gene, the clusterin protein (also known as apoplipoprotein J) encoded by the CLU gene, the presenilin 1 protein encoded by the PSENI gene, the presenilin 2 protein encoded by the PSEN2 gene, the sortilin-related receptor L(DLR class) A repeats-containing protein (SORL1) protein encoded by the SORLI gene, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) encoded by the APP gene, the Apolipoprotein E precursor (APOE) encoded by the APOE gene, or the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) encoded by the BDNF gene. In an exemplary embodiment, the genetically modified animal is a rat, and the edited chromosomal sequence encoding the protein associated with AD is as as follows: APP amyloid precursor protein (APP) NM_013155 receptor protein (VLDLR) The animal or cell may comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or more disrupted chromosomal sequences encoding a protein associated with AD and zero, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or more chromosomally integrated sequences encoding a protein associated with AD. The edited or integrated chromosomal sequence may be modified to encode an altered protein associated with AD. A number of mutations in AD-related chromosomal sequences have been associated with AD. For instance, the V7171 (i.e. valine at position 717 is changed to isoleucine) missense mutation in APP causes familial AD. Multiple mutations in the presenilin-1 protein, such as H163R (i.e. histidine at position 163 is changed to arginine), A246E (i.e. alanine at position 246 is changed to glutamate), L286V (i.e. leucine at position 286 is changed to valine) and C410Y (i.e. cysteine at position 410 is changed to tyrosine) cause familial Alzheimer's type 3. Mutations in the presenilin-2 protein, such as N141 I (i.e. asparagine at position 141 is changed to isoleucine), M239V (i.e. methionine at position 239 is changed to valine), and D439A (i.e. aspartate at position 439 is changed to alanine) cause familial Alzheimer's type 4. Other associations of genetic variants in AD-associated genes and disease are known in the art. See, for example, Waring et al. (2008) Arch. Neurol. 65:329-334, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.Secretase Disorders US Patent Publication No. 20110023146, describes use of zinc finger nucleases to genetically modify cells, animals and proteins associated with secretase-associated disorders. Secretases are essential for processing pre-proteins into their biologically active forms. Defects in various components of the secretase pathways contribute to many disorders, particularly those with hallmark amyloidogenesis or amyloid plaques, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). A secretase disorder and the proteins associated with these disorders are a diverse set of proteins that effect susceptibility for numerous disorders, the presence of the disorder, the severity of the disorder, or any combination thereof. The present disclosure comprises editing of any chromosomal sequences that encode proteins associated with a secretase disorder. The proteins associated with a secretase disorder are typically selected based on an experimental association of the secretase\u2014related proteins with the development of a secretase disorder. For example, the production rate or circulating concentration of a protein associated with a secretase disorder may be elevated or depressed in a population with a secretase disorder relative to a population without a secretase disorder. Differences in protein levels may be assessed using proteomic techniques including but not limited to Western blot, immunohistochemical staining, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and mass spectrometry. Alternatively, the protein associated with a secretase disorder may be identified by obtaining gene expression profiles of the genes encoding the proteins using genomic techniques including but not limited to DNA microarray analysis, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). By way of non-limiting example, proteins associated with a secretase disorder precursor protein), APH1B pharynx defective 1 homolog B (dystonia 10), metallopeptidase domain STN (statin), TP53 (tumor protein p53), IL6 (interleukin 6 (interferon, beta 2)), NGFR (nerve growth factor receptor (TNFR superfamily, member 16)), IL1B (interleukin 1, beta), ACHE (acetylcholinesterase (Yt blood group)), (cadherin-associated protein), IGF1 (epithelial)), APBB1 (amyloid beta precursor protein-binding, 1 (Fe65)), HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase), (cAMP responsive (prostaglandin G/H synthase enhancer of split 1, (Drosophila)), CAT (catalase), TGFB1 (transforming growth factor, beta 1), ENO2 (enolase 2 (gamma, neuronal)), ERBB4 (v-erb-a erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4 protein particle complex 10), MAOB (monoamine oxidase B), NGF (nerve (basic)), IL3 (interleukin 3 (colony-stimulating factor, multiple)), LRP1 (low density group)), P (granule membrane protein 140 kDa, antigen ADCYAP1 IL5 receptor), RARA (retinoic kinase bone marrow killer cell activator, eosinophil granule major basic protein)), PRKCA (protein kinase C, alpha), L1 CAM (L1 cell adhesion molecule), CD40 (CD40 molecule, TNF receptor superfamily member 5), NR1I2 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group I, member 2), JAG2 (jagged 2), CTNND1 (catenin (cadherin-associated protein), receptor 3), TFAP2A (transcription factor AP-2 alpha (activating enhancer binding protein 2 alpha)), SCP2 (transcription factor 7-like 2 (T-cell specific, HMG-box)), IL1R2 receptor, type B3GALTL p53 factor 4 (tax-responsive element growth factor alpha polypeptide), f33 21 open reading frame 33), SCG5 (secretogranin V (7B2 protein)), RNF123 (ring finger protein 123), NFKB1 (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1), ERBB2 (v-erb-b2 uterine)), TGFA (transforming (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 21), DLG1 (discs, (hairy of split 5 (Drosophila)), GCC1 (GRIP and coiled-coil domain containing 1), and any combination thereof. The genetically modified animal or cell may comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more disrupted chromosomal sequences encoding a protein associated with a secretase disorder and zero, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more chromosomally integrated sequences encoding a disrupted protein associated with a secretase disorder.ALS US Patent Publication No. 20110023144, describes use of zinc finger nucleases to genetically modify cells, animals and proteins associated with amyotrophyic lateral sclerosis (ALS) disease. ALS is characterized by the gradual steady degeneration of certain nerve cells in the brain cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord involved in voluntary movement. Motor neuron disorders and the proteins associated with these disorders are a diverse set of proteins that effect susceptibility for developing a motor neuron disorder, the presence of the motor neuron disorder, the severity of the motor neuron disorder or any combination thereof. The present disclosure comprises editing of any chromosomal sequences that encode proteins associated with ALS disease, a specific motor neuron disorder. The proteins associated with ALS are typically selected based on an experimental association of ALS\u2014related proteins to ALS. For example, the production rate or circulating concentration of a protein associated with ALS may be elevated or depressed in a population with ALS relative to a population without ALS. Differences in protein levels may be assessed using proteomic techniques including but not limited to Western blot, immunohistochemical staining, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and mass spectrometry. Alternatively, the proteins associated with ALS may be identified by obtaining gene expression profiles of the genes encoding the proteins using genomic techniques including but not limited to DNA microarray analysis, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). By way of non-limiting example, proteins associated with ALS include but are not limited to the following proteins: SOD1 superoxide dismutase sclerosis 5 FUS lateral sclerosis 7 necrosis factor (glial high affinity receptor superfamily, glutamate transporter), member 10b member 2 PRPH peripherin HSP90AA1 heat shock protein 90 kDa alpha (cytosolic), class A member 1 GRIA2 aldehyde oxidase lateral GLS glutaminase sclerosis 2 (juvenile) 4 ALS2CR8 amyotrophic lateral CNTFR ciliary neurotrophic factor sclerosis 2 (juvenile) region, candidate 8 ALS2CR11 amyotrophic lateral FOLH1 folate hydrolase 1 sclerosis 2 (juvenile) chromosome region, candidate 11 FAM117B family with sequence P4HB prolyl 4-hydroxylase, similarity 33 monooxygenase/tryptoph 5-monooxygenase member 1 activation protein, theta polypeptide TRAK2 trafficking protein, homolog, SAC1 interacting INA internexin alpha family, 5 VAPB VAMP (vesicle-ESRI estrogen receptor 1 associated membrane and C SNCA synuclein, alpha HGF factor BAX BCL2-associated X HSF1 heat transcription protein factor 1 RNF19A ring finger protein 19A JUN jun oncogene ALS2CR12 amyotrophic lateral HSPA5 heat shock 70 kDa sclerosis 2 (juvenile) protein 5 chromosome region, candidate 12 MAPK14 mitogen-activated protein A GDNF nuclear factor (erythroid-neurotrophic factor derived 2)-like 2 SLC6A3 solute carrier family 6 HSPA4 heat shock 70 kDa (neurotransmitter protein 4 transporter, 3 (neuronal/epithelial high affinity glutamate transporter, system Xag), member 1 SMN2 survival of motor neuron CCNC membrane protein, STUB1 and U-palmitoylated protein 1 peroxiredoxin 6 component 1, subcomponent, B chain VEGFC nerve growth factor HTT acetylcholine), member 3 TRPM7 transient receptor HSPB2 heat shock 27 kDa potential cation channel, protein thymoma DERL1 (C\u2014X\u2014C motif) FLT1 tyrosine PON1 paraoxonase 1 receptor LIF binding, soluble, receptor 1 receptor kinase) OGG1 8-oxoguanine DNA IL6 interleukin 6 (interferon, glycosylase beta 2). The animal or cell may comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more disrupted chromosomal sequences encoding a protein associated with ALS and zero, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more chromosomally integrated sequences encoding the disrupted protein associated with ALS. Preferred proteins associated with ALS include SOD1 (superoxide dismutase 1), ALS2 (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2), FUS sarcoma), TARDBP (TAR DNA binding protein), VAGFA (vascular endothelial growth B), and VAGFC (vascular endothelial growth factor C), and any combination thereof.Autism US Patent Publication No. 20110023145, describes use of zinc finger nucleases to genetically modify cells, animals and proteins associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of disorders characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction and communication, and restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. The three disorders, autism, Asperger syndrome (AS) and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) are a continuum of the same disorder with varying degrees of severity, associated intellectual functioning and medical conditions. ASDs are predominantly genetically determined disorders with a heritability of around 90%. US Patent Publication No. 20110023145 comprises editing of any chromosomal sequences that encode proteins associated with ASD which may be applied to the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention. The proteins associated with ASD are typically selected based on an experimental association of the protein associated with ASD to an incidence or indication of an ASD. For example, the production rate or circulating concentration of a protein associated with ASD may be elevated or depressed in a population having an ASD relative to a population lacking the ASD. Differences in protein levels may be assessed using proteomic techniques including but not limited to Western blot, immunohistochemical staining, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and mass spectrometry. Alternatively, the proteins associated with ASD may be identified by obtaining gene expression profiles of the genes encoding the proteins using genomic techniques including but not limited to DNA microarray analysis, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). Non limiting examples of disease states or disorders that may be associated with proteins associated with ASD include autism, Asperger syndrome (AS), pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), Rett's syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, phenylketonuria, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome and fragile X syndrome. By way of non-limiting example, proteins associated with ASD include but are not limited to the following proteins: ATP10C 3 type member 1 TAS2R MAZ Myc-associated zinc finger TSC1 Tuberous sclerosis protein protein 1 MDGA2 MAM domain containing TSC2 Tuberous sclerosis glycosylphosphatidylinositol protein 2 anchor 2 (MDGA2) MECP2 (MECP2) MMTV integration site family, member 2 (WNT2) The identity of the protein associated with ASD whose chromosomal sequence is edited can and will vary. In preferred embodiments, the proteins associated with ASD whose chromosomal sequence is edited may be the benzodiazapine receptor (peripheral) associated protein 1 (BZRAP1) encoded by the BZRAP1 gene, the AF4/FMR2 family member 2 protein (AFF2) encoded by the AFF2 gene (also termed MFR2), the fragile X mental retardation autosomal homolog 1 protein (FXR1) encoded by the FXR1 gene, the fragile X mental retardation autosomal homolog 2 protein (FXR2) encoded by the FXR2 gene, the MAM domain containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor 2 protein (MDGA2) encoded by the MDGA2 gene, the methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) encoded by the MECP2 gene, the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (MGLUR5) encoded by the MGLUR5-1 gene (also termed GRM5), the neurexin 1 protein encoded by the NRXN1 gene, or the semaphorin-5A protein (SEMA5A) encoded by the SEMA5A gene. In an exemplary embodiment, the genetically modified animal is a rat, and the edited chromosomal sequence encoding the protein associated with ASD is as listed below: BZRAP benzodiazapine receptor US Patent Publication No. 20110016540, describes use of zinc finger nucleases to genetically modify cells, animals and proteins associated with trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders. Trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders are complex, progressive disorders that involve developmental neurobiology and often affect cognition as well as sensori-motor functions. Trinucleotide repeat expansion proteins are a diverse set of proteins associated with susceptibility for developing a trinucleotide repeat expansion disorder, the presence of a trinucleotide repeat expansion disorder, the severity of a trinucleotide repeat expansion disorder or any combination thereof. Trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders are divided into two categories determined by the type of repeat. The most common repeat is the triplet CAG, which, when present in the coding region of a gene, codes for the amino acid glutamine (Q). Therefore, these disorders are referred to as the polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders and comprise the following Spinobulbar Muscular Atrophy (SBMA); Spinocerebellar Ataxias (SCA types 6, and 17); and Dentatorubro-Pallidoluysian Atrophy (DRPLA). The remaining trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders either do not involve the CAG triplet or the CAG triplet is not in the coding region of the gene and are, therefore, referred to as the non-polyglutamine disorders. The non-polyglutamine disorders comprise Fragile X Syndrome 8, and 12). The proteins associated with trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders are typically selected based on an experimental association of the protein associated with a trinucleotide repeat expansion disorder to a trinucleotide repeat expansion disorder. For example, the production rate or circulating concentration of a protein associated with a trinucleotide repeat expansion disorder may be elevated or depressed in a population having a trinucleotide repeat expansion disorder relative to a population lacking the trinucleotide repeat expansion disorder. Differences in protein levels may be assessed using proteomic techniques including but not limited to Western blot, immunohistochemical staining, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and mass spectrometry. Alternatively, the proteins associated with trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders may be identified by obtaining gene expression profiles of the genes encoding the proteins using genomic techniques including but not limited to DNA microarray analysis, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). Non-limiting examples of proteins associated with trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders include AR (androgen receptor), FMR1 (fragile (ataxin (mutS homolog (transmembrane protein rare, fra(X)(q28) GNB2 (guanine nucleotide binding POLG (polymerase directed), gamma), AFF2 (AF4/FMR2 family, member 2), THBS1 (thrombospondin 1), ESR1 (estrogen repeat KLK3 subfamily N, (BCL2-associated protein), FRAXA (fragile site, folic acid type, rare, fra(X)(q27.3) A (macroorchidism, mental retardation)), KBTBD10 ERDAl (expanded repeat domain, CAG/CTG 1), TSC (tuberous 1), coli)), DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2), CD44 (CD44 molecule (Indian blood group)), (numb 2), CRYGC (crystallin, gamma C), SRP14 (signal recognition particle 14 kDa (homologous Alu RNA binding protein)), CRYGB (crystallin, gamma B), PDCD1 (programmed 2), HOXA5 (homeobox ENSG00000078687. Preferred proteins associated with trinucleotide repeat expansion low density lipoprotein receptor), and any combination thereof.Treating Hearing Diseases The present invention also contemplates delivering the CRISPR-Cas system to one or both ears. Researchers are looking into whether gene therapy could be used to aid current deafness treatments\u2014namely, cochlear implants. Deafness is often caused by lost or damaged hair cells that cannot relay signals to auditory neurons. In such cases, cochlear implants may be used to respond to sound and transmit electrical signals to the nerve cells. But these neurons often degenerate and retract from the cochlea as fewer growth factors are released by impaired hair cells. US patent application 20120328580 describes injection of a pharmaceutical composition into the ear (e.g., auricular administration), such as into the luminae of the cochlea (e.g., the Scala media, Sc vestibulae, using a syringe, e.g., a single-dose syringe. For example, one or more of the compounds described herein can be administered by intratympanic injection (e.g., into the middle ear), and/or injections into the outer, middle, and/or inner ear. Such methods are routinely used in the art, for example, for the administration of steroids and antibiotics into human ears. Injection can be, for example, through the round window of the ear or through the cochlear capsule. Other inner ear administration methods are known in the art (see, e.g., Salt and Plontke, Drug Discovery Today, 10:1299-1306, 2005). In another mode of administration, the pharmaceutical composition can be administered in situ, via a catheter or pump. A catheter or pump can, for example, direct a pharmaceutical composition into the cochlear luminae or the round window of the ear and/or the lumen of the colon. Exemplary drug delivery apparatus and methods suitable for administering one or more of the compounds described herein into an ear, e.g., a human ear, are described by McKenna et al., (U.S. Publication No. 2006/0030837) and Jacobsen et al., (U.S. Pat. No. 7,206,639). In some embodiments, a catheter or pump can be positioned, e.g., in the ear (e.g., the outer, middle, and/or inner ear) of a patient during a surgical procedure. In some embodiments, a catheter or pump can be positioned, e.g., in the ear (e.g., the outer, middle, and/or inner ear) of a patient without the need for a surgical procedure. Alternatively or in addition, one or more of the compounds described herein can be administered in combination with a mechanical device such as a cochlear implant or a hearing aid, which is worn in the outer ear. An exemplary cochlear implant that is suitable for use with the present invention is described by Edge et al., (U.S. Publication No. 2007/0093878). In some embodiments, the modes of administration described above may be combined in any order and can be simultaneous or interspersed. Alternatively or in addition, the present invention may be administered according to any of the Food and Drug Administration approved methods, for example, as described in CDER Data Standards Manual, version number 004 (which is available at fda.give/cder/dsm/DRG/drg00301.htm). In general, the cell therapy methods described in US patent application 20120328580 can be used to promote complete or partial differentiation of a cell to or towards a mature cell type of the inner ear (e.g., a hair cell) in vitro. Cells resulting from such methods can then be transplanted or implanted into a patient in need of such treatment. The cell culture methods required to practice these methods, including methods for identifying and selecting suitable cell types, methods for promoting complete or partial differentiation of selected cells, methods for identifying complete or partially differentiated cell types, and methods for implanting complete or partially differentiated cells are described below. Cells suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, cells that are capable of differentiating completely or partially into a mature cell of the inner ear, e.g., a hair cell (e.g., an inner and/or outer hair cell), when contacted, e.g., in vitro, with one or more of the compounds described herein. Exemplary cells that are capable of differentiating into a hair cell include, but are not limited to stem cells (e.g., inner ear stem cells, adult stem cells, bone marrow derived stem cells, embryonic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, skin stem cells, iPS cells, and fat derived stem cells), progenitor cells (e.g., inner ear progenitor cells), support cells (e.g., Deiters' cells, pillar cells, inner phalangeal cells, tectal cells and Hensen's cells), and/or germ cells. The use of stem cells for the replacement of inner ear sensory cells is described in Li et al., (U.S. Publication No. 2005/0287127) and Li et al., (U.S. patent Ser. No. 11/953,797). The use of bone marrow derived stem cells for the replacement of inner ear sensory cells is described in Edge et al., PCT/US2007/084654. iPS cells are described, e.g., at Takahashi et al., Cell, Volume 131, Issue 5, Pages 861-872 (2007); Takahashi and Yamanaka, and Scholer, Cell 131(5):834-835 (2007). Such suitable cells can be identified by analyzing (e.g., qualitatively or quantitatively) the presence of one or more tissue specific genes. For example, gene expression can be detected by detecting the protein product of one or more tissue-specific genes. Protein detection techniques involve staining proteins (e.g., using cell extracts or whole cells) using antibodies against the appropriate antigen. In this case, the appropriate antigen is the protein product of the tissue-specific gene expression. Although, in principle, a first antibody (i.e., the antibody that binds the antigen) can be labeled, it is more common (and improves the visualization) to use a second antibody directed against the first (e.g., an anti-IgG). This second antibody is conjugated either with fluorochromes, or appropriate enzymes for colorimetric reactions, or gold beads (for electron microscopy), or with the biotin-avidin system, so that the location of the primary antibody, and thus the antigen, can be recognized. The CRISPR Cas molecules of the present invention may be delivered to the ear by direct application of pharmaceutical composition to the outer ear, with compositions modified from US Published application, 20110142917. In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition is applied to the ear canal. Delivery to the ear may also be refered to as aural or otic delivery. In some embodiments the RNA molecules of the invention are delivered in liposome or lipofectin formulations and the like and can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Such methods are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,593,972, 5,589,466, and 5,580,859, which are herein incorporated by reference. Delivery systems aimed specifically at the enhanced and improved delivery of siRNA into mammalian cells have been developed, (see, for example, Shen et al FEBS Let. 2003, 539:111-114; Xia et al., Nat. Biotech. 2002, 20:1006-1010; Reich et al., Mol. Vision. 2003, 9: al., J. Mol. Biol. 2003, et al., Nat. Gen. 2002, 32: 107-108 and Simeoni et al., NAR 2003, 31, 11: 2717-2724) and may be applied to the present invention. siRNA has recently been successfully used for inhibition of gene expression in primates (see for example. Tolentino et al., Retina 24(4):660 which may also be applied to the present invention. Qi et al. discloses methods for efficient siRNA transfection to the inner ear through the intact round window by a novel proteidic delivery technology which may be applied to the nucleic acid-targeting system of the present invention (see, e.g., Qi et al., Gene Therapy (2013), 1-9). In particular, a TAT double stranded RNA-binding domains (TAT-DRBDs), which can transfect Cy3-labeled siRNA into cells of the inner ear, including the inner and outer hair cells, crista ampullaris, macula utriculi and macula sacculi, through successful for delivering double stranded siRNAs in vivo for treating various inner ear ailments and preservation of hearing function. About 40 l of 10 mM RNA may be contemplated as the dosage for administration to the ear. According to Rejali et al. (Hear Res. 2007 June; 228(1-2):180-7), cochlear implant function can be improved by good preservation of the spiral ganglion neurons, which are the target of electrical stimulation by the implant and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has previously been shown to enhance spiral ganglion survival in experimentally deafened ears. Rejali et al. tested a modified design of the cochlear implant electrode that includes a coating of fibroblast cells transduced by a viral vector with a BDNF gene insert. To accomplish this type of ex vivo gene transfer, Rejali et al. transduced guinea pig fibroblasts with an adenovirus with a BDNF gene cassette insert, and determined that these cells secreted BDNF and then attached BDNF-secreting cells to the cochlear implant electrode via an agarose gel, and implanted the electrode in the scala tympani. Rejali et al. determined that the BDNF expressing electrodes were able to preserve significantly more spiral ganglion neurons in the basal turns of the cochlea after 48 days of implantation when compared to control electrodes and demonstrated the feasibility of combining cochlear implant therapy with ex vivo gene transfer for enhancing spiral ganglion neuron survival. Such a system may be applied to the nucleic acid-targeting system of the present invention for delivery to the ear. Mukherjea et al. (Antioxidants & Redox Signaling, Volume 13, Number 5, 2010) document that knockdown of NOX3 using short interfering (si) RNA abrogated cisplatin ototoxicity, as evidenced by protection of OHCs from damage and reduced threshold shifts in auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). Different doses of siNOX3 (0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 g) were administered to rats and NOX3 expression was evaluated by real time RT-PCR. The lowest dose of NOX3 siRNA used (0.3 g) did not show any inhibition of NOX3 mRNA when compared to transtympanic administration of scrambled siRNA or untreated cochleae. However, administration of the higher doses of NOX3 siRNA (0.6 and 0.9 g) reduced NOX3 expression compared to control scrambled siRNA. Such a system may be applied to the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention for transtympanic administration with a dosage of about 2 mg to about 4 mg of CRISPR Cas for administration to a human. Jung et al. (Molecular Therapy, vol. 21 no. 4, 834-841 April 2013) demonstrate that Hes5 levels in the utricle decreased after the application of siRNA and that the number of hair cells in these utricles was significantly larger than following control treatment. The data suggest that siRNA technology may be useful for inducing repair and regeneration in the inner ear and that the Notch signaling pathway is a potentially useful target for specific gene expression inhibition. Jung et al. injected 8 g of Hes5 siRNA in 2 l volume, prepared by adding sterile normal saline to the lyophilized siRNA to a vestibular epithelium of the ear. Such a system may be applied to the nucleic acid-targeting system of the present invention for administration to the vestibular epithelium of the ear with a dosage of about 1 to about 30 mg of CRISPR Cas for administration to a human.Gene Targeting in Non-Dividing Cells (Neurones & Muscle) Non-dividing (especially non-dividing, fully differentiated) cell types present issues for gene targeting or genome engineering, for example because homologous recombination (HR) is generally supressed in the G cell-cycle phase. However, while studying the mechanisms by which cells control normal DNA repair systems, Durocher discovered a previously unknown switch that keeps HR \"off\" in non-dividing cells and devised a strategy to toggle this switch back on. Orthwein et al. (Daniel Durocher's lab at the Mount Sinai Hospital in Ottawa, Canada) recently reported (Nature 16142, published online 9 Dec. 2015) have shown that the suppression of HR can be lifted and gene targeting successfully concluded in both kidney (293T) and osteosarcoma (U20S) cells. Tumor suppressors, BRCA1, PALB2 and BRAC2 are known to promote DNA DSB repair by HR. They found that formation of a complex of BRCA1 with PALB2-BRAC2 is governed by a ubiquitin site on PALB2, such that action on the site by an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This E3 ubiquitin ligase is cullin-3 (CUL3)-RBX1. suppresses counteracted by the deubiquitylase USP11, which is itself under cell cycle control. Restoration of the BRCA1-PALB2 interaction combined with the activation of DNA-end resection is sufficient to induce homologous recombination in G1, as measured by a number of methods including a CRISPR-Cas9-based gene-targeting assay directed at USP11 or KEAP1 (expressed from a pX459 vector). However, when the BRCA1-PALB2 interaction was restored in resection-competent G1 cells using either KEAP1 depletion or expression of the PALB2-KR mutant, a robust increase in gene-targeting events was detected. Thus, reactivation of HR in cells, especially non-dividing, fully differentiated cell types is preferred, in some embodiments. In some embodiments, promotion of the BRCA1-PALB2 interaction is preferred in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the target ell is a non-dividing cell. In some embodiments, the target cell is a neurone or muscle cell. In some embodiments, the target cell is targeted in vivo. In some embodiments, the cell is in G1 and HR is supressed. In some embodiments, use of KEAP1 depletion, for example inhibition of expression of KEAP1 activity, is preferred. KEAP1 depletion may be achieved through siRNA, for example as shown in Orthwein et al. Alternatively, expression of the PALB2-KR mutant (lacking all eight Lys residues in the BRCA1-interaction domain is preferred, either in combination with KEAP1 depletion or alone. PALB2-KR interacts with BRCA1 irrespective of cell cycle position. Thus, promotion or restoration of the BRCA1-PALB2 interaction, especially in G1 cells, is preferred in some embodiments, especially where the target cells are non-dividing, or where removal and return (ex vivo gene targeting) is problematic, for example neurone or muscle cells. KEAP1 siRNA is available from ThermoFischer. In some embodiments, a BRCA1-PALB2 complex may be delivered to the GI cell. In some embodiments, PALB2 deubiquitylation may be promoted for example by increased expression of the deubiquitylase USP11, so it is envisaged that a construct may be provided to promote or up-regulate expression or activity of the deubiquitylase USP11.Treating Diseases of the Eye The present invention also contemplates delivering the CRISPR-Cas system to one or both eyes. In particular embodiments of the invention, the CRISPR-Cas system may be used to correct ocular defects that arise from several genetic mutations further described in Genetic Diseases of the Eye, Second Edition, edited by Elias I. Traboulsi, Oxford University Press, 2012. In some embodiments, the condition to be treated or targeted is an eye disorder. In some embodiments, the eye disorder may include glaucoma. In some embodiments, the eye disorder includes a retinal degenerative disease. In some embodiments, the retinal degenerative disease is selected from Stargardt disease, Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, Best disease, Blue Cone Monochromacy, Choroidermia, Cone-rod dystrophy, Stationary age related macular degeneration. In some embodiments, the retinal degenerative disease is Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) or Retinitis Pigmentosa. In some embodiments, the CRISPR system is delivered to the eye, optionally via intravitreal injection or subretinal injection. For administration to the eye, lentiviral vectors, in particular equine infectious anemia viruses (EIAV) are particularly preferred. In another embodiment, minimal non-primate lentiviral vectors based on the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) are also contemplated, especially for ocular gene therapy (see, e.g., Balagaan, J Gene Med 2006; 8: 275-285, Published 2005 in Wiley InterScience (www.interscience.wiley.com). DOI: 10.1002/jgm.845). The vectors are contemplated to have cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter driving expression of the target gene. Intracameral, subretinal, intraocular and intravitreal injections are all contemplated (see, e.g., Balagaan, J Gene Med 2006; 8: 275-285, Published 2005 in Wiley InterScience (www.interscience.wiley.com). DOI: 10.1002/jgm.845). Intraocular injections may be performed with the aid of an operating microscope. For subretinal and intravitreal injections, eyes may be prolapsed by gentle digital pressure and fundi visualised using a contact lens system consisting of a drop of a coupling medium solution on the cornea covered with a glass microscope slide coverslip. For subretinal injections, the tip of a 10-mm 34-gauge needle, mounted on a 5-l Hamilton syringe may be advanced under direct visualisation through the superior equatorial sclera tangentially towards the posterior pole until the aperture of the needle was visible in the subretinal space. Then, 2 l of vector suspension may be injected to produce a superior bullous retinal detachment, thus confirming subretinal vector administration. This approach creates a self-sealing sclerotomy allowing the vector suspension to be retained in the subretinal space until it is absorbed by the RPE, usually within 48 h of the procedure. This procedure may be repeated in the inferior hemisphere to produce an inferior retinal detachment. This technique results in the exposure of approximately 70% of neurosensory retina and RPE to the vector suspension. For intravitreal injections, the needle tip may be advanced through the sclera 1 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus and 2 l of vector suspension injected into the vitreous cavity. For intracameral injections, the needle tip may be advanced through a corneoscleral limbal paracentesis, directed towards the central cornea, and 2 l of vector suspension may be injected. For intracameral injections, the needle tip may be advanced through a corneoscleral limbal paracentesis, directed towards the central cornea, and 2 l of vector suspension may be injected. These vectors may be injected at titres of either 1.0-1.4\u00d71010 or 1.0-1.4\u00d7109 transducing units equine anemia virus-based lentiviral gene therapy vector that expresses angiostatic proteins endostain and angiostatin that is delivered via a subretinal injection for the treatment of the web form of age-related macular degeneration is also contemplated (see, e.g., Binley et al., HUMAN GENE THERAPY 23:980-991 (September 2012)). Such a vector may be modified for the CRISPR-Cas system of the present invention. Each eye may be treated with either RetinoStat@ at a dose of 1.1\u00d7105 transducing units per eye (TU/eye) in a total volume of 100 l. In another embodiment, an E1-, partial E3-, E4-deleted adenoviral vector may be contemplated for delivery to the eye. Twenty-eight patients with advanced neovascular agerelated macular degeneration (AMD) were given a single intravitreous injection of an E1-, partial E3-, E4-deleted adenoviral vector expressing human pigment ep-ithelium-derived factor (AdPEDF.ll) (see, e.g., Campochiaro et al., Human Gene Therapy 17:167-176 (February 2006)). Doses ranging from 106 to 109.5 particle units (PU) were investigated and there were no serious adverse events related to AdPEDF.11 and no dose-limiting toxicities (see, e.g., Campochiaro et al., Human Gene Therapy 17:167-176 (February 2006)). Adenoviral vectormediated ocular gene transfer appears to be a viable approach for the treatment of ocular disorders and could be applied to the CRISPR Cas system. In another embodiment, the sd-rxRNA@ system of RXi Pharmaceuticals may be used/and or adapted for delivering CRISPR Cas to the eye. In this system, a single intravitreal administration of 3 g of sd-rxRNA results in sequence-specific reduction of PPIB mRNA levels for 14 days. The the sd-rxRNA@ system may be applied to the nucleic acid-targeting system of the present invention, contemplating a dose of about 3 to 20 mg of CRISPR administered to a human. Millington-Ward et al. (Molecular Therapy, vol. 19 no. 4, 642-649 April 2011) describes adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to deliver an RNA interference (RNAi)-based rhodopsin suppressor and a codon-modified rhodopsin replacement gene resistant to suppression due to nucleotide alterations at degenerate positions over the RNAi target site. An injection of either 6.0\u00d7108 vp or 1.8\u00d71010 vp AAV were subretinally injected into the eyes by Millington-Ward et al. The AAV vectors of Millington-Ward et al. may be applied to the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention, contemplating a dose of about 2\u00d71011 to about 6\u00d71013 vp administered to a human. Dalkara et al. (Sci Transl Med 5, 189ra76 (2013)) also relates to in vivo directed evolution to fashion an AAV vector that delivers wild-type versions of defective genes throughout the retina after noninjurious injection into the eyes' vitreous humor. Dalkara describes a a 7mer peptide display library and an AAV library constructed by DNA shuffling of cap genes from AAV1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. The rcAAV libraries and rAAV vectors expressing GFP under a CAG or Rho promoter were packaged and and deoxyribonuclease-resistant genomic titers were obtained through quantitative PCR. The libraries were pooled, and two rounds of evolution were performed, each consisting of initial library diversification followed by three in vivo selection steps. In each such step, P30 rho-GFP mice were intravitreally injected with 2 ml phosphate-buffered saline with a genomic 1\u00d71012 vg/ml. The AAV vectors of Dalkara et al. may be applied to the nucleic acid-targeting system of the present invention, contemplating a dose of about 1\u00d71015 to about 1\u00d71016 vg/ml administered to a human. In a particular embodiment, the rhodopsin gene may be targeted for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa (RP), wherein the system of US Patent Publication No. 20120204282 assigned to Sangamo BioSciences, Inc. may be modified in accordance of the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention. In another embodiment, the methods of US Patent Publication No. 20130183282 assigned to Cellectis, which is directed to methods of cleaving a target sequence from the human rhodopsin gene, may also be modified to the nucleic acid-targeting system of the present invention. US Patent Publication No. 20130202678 assigned to Academia Sinica relates to methods for treating retinopathies and sight-threatening ophthalmologic disorders relating to delivering of the Puf-A gene (which is expressed in retinal ganglion and pigmented cells of eye tissues and displays a unique anti-apoptotic activity) to the sub-retinal or intravitreal space in the eye. In particular, may be targeted by the nucleic acid-targeting system of the present invention. Wu (Cell Stem Cell, 13:659-62, 2013) designed a guide RNA that led Cas9 to a single base pair mutation that causes cataracts in mice, where it induced DNA cleavage. Then using either the other wild-type allele or oligos given to the zygotes repair mechanisms corrected the sequence of the broken allele and corrected the cataract-causing genetic defect in mutant mouse. US Patent Publication No. 20120159653, describes use of zinc finger nucleases to genetically modify cells, animals and proteins associated with macular degeration (MD). Macular degeneration (MD) is the primary cause of visual impairment in the elderly, but is also a hallmark symptom of childhood diseases such as Stargardt disease, Sorsby fundus, and fatal childhood neurodegenerative diseases, with an age of onset as young as infancy. Macular degeneration results in a loss of vision in the center of the visual field (the macula) because of damage to the retina. Currently existing animal models do not recapitulate major hallmarks of the disease as it is observed in humans. The available animal models comprising mutant genes encoding proteins associated with MD also produce highly variable phenotypes, making translations to human disease and therapy development problematic. One aspect of US Patent Publication No. 20120159653 relates to editing of any chromosomal sequences that encode proteins associated with MD which may be applied to the nucleic acid-targeting system of the present invention. The proteins associated with MD are typically selected based on an experimental association of the protein associated with MD to an MD disorder. For example, the production rate or circulating concentration of a protein associated with MD may be elevated or depressed in a population having an MD disorder relative to a population lacking the MD disorder. Differences in protein levels may be assessed using proteomic techniques including but not limited to Western blot, immunohistochemical staining, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and mass spectrometry. Alternatively, the proteins associated with MD may be identified by obtaining gene expression profiles of the genes encoding the proteins using genomic techniques including but not limited to DNA microarray analysis, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). By way of non-limiting example, proteins associated with MD include but are not limited to the following proteins: (ABCA4) ATP-binding cassette, sub-family necrosis protein 5 (C1QTNF5) C2 Complement component 2 (CCR2) Cluster of Differentiation 36 CFB Complement factor B CFH Complement factor CFH H CFHR1 complement factor complement factor of chain fatty acids 4 ERCC6 excision repair crosscomplementing 3. The identity of the protein associated with MD whose chromosomal sequence is edited can and will vary. In preferred embodiments, the proteins associated with MD whose chromosomal sequence is edited may be the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A (ABC1) member 4 protein (ABCA4) encoded by the ABCR gene, the apolipoprotein E protein (APOE) encoded by the APOE gene, the chemokine (C\u2014C motif) Ligand 2 protein (CCL2) encoded by the CCL2 gene, the chemokine (C\u2014C motif) receptor 2 protein (CCR2) encoded by the CCR2 gene, the ceruloplasmin protein (CP) encoded by the CP gene, the cathepsin D protein (CTSD) encoded by the CTSD gene, or the metalloproteinase inhibitor 3 protein (TIMP3) encoded by the TIMP3 gene. In an exemplary embodiment, the genetically modified animal is a rat, and the edited chromosomal sequence encoding the protein associated with MD may be: (ABCA4) ATPbinding cassette, The animal or cell may comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more disrupted chromosomal sequences encoding a protein associated with MD and zero, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more chromosomally integrated sequences encoding the disrupted protein associated with MD. The edited or integrated chromosomal sequence may be modified to encode an altered protein associated with MD. Several mutations in MD-related chromosomal sequences have been associated with MD. Non-limiting examples of mutations in chromosomal sequences associated with MD include those that may cause MD including in the ABCR protein, E471K (i.e. glutamate at position 471 is changed to lysine), R1129L (i.e. arginine at position 1129 is changed to leucine), T1428M (i.e. threonine at position 1428 is changed to methionine), R1517S (i.e. arginine at position 1517 is changed to serine), I1562T (i.e. isoleucine at position 1562 is changed to threonine), and G1578R (i.e. glycine at position 1578 is changed to arginine); in the CCR2 protein, V64I (i.e. valine at position 192 is changed to isoleucine); in CP protein, G969B (i.e. glycine at position 969 is changed to asparagine or aspartate); in TIMP3 protein, S156C (i.e. serine at position 156 is changed to cysteine), G166C (i.e. glycine at position 166 is changed to cysteine), G167C (i.e. glycine at position 167 is changed to cysteine), Y168C (i.e. tyrosine at position 168 is changed to cysteine), S170C (i.e. serine at position 170 is changed to cysteine), Y172C (i.e. tyrosine at position 172 is changed to cysteine) and S181C (i.e. serine at position 181 is changed to cysteine). Other associations of genetic variants in MD-associated genes and disease are known in the art. CRISPR systems are useful to correct diseases resulting from autosomal dominant genes. For example, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to remove an autosomal dominant gene that causes receptor loss in the eye.

Molecular Therapy, 2015; DOI: 10.1038/mt.2015.220.Treating Circulatory and Muscular Diseases The present invention also contemplates delivering the CRISPR-Cas system described herein, e.g. Cpf1 effector protein systems, to the heart. For the heart, a myocardium tropic adena-associated virus (AAVM) is preferred, in particular AAVM41 which showed preferential gene transfer in the heart (see, e.g., Lin-Yanga et al., PNAS, Mar. 10, 2009, vol. 106, no. 10). Administration may be systemic or local. A dosage of about 1-10\u00d71014 vector genomes are contemplated for systemic administration. See also, e.g., Eulalio et al. (2012) Nature 492: 376 and Somasuntharam et al. (2013) Biomaterials 34: 7790. For example, US Patent Publication No. 20110023139, describes use of zinc finger nucleases to genetically modify cells, animals and proteins associated with cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular diseases generally include high blood pressure, heart attacks, heart failure, and stroke and TIA. Any chromosomal sequence involved in cardiovascular disease or the protein encoded by any chromosomal sequence involved in cardiovascular disease may be utilized in the methods described in this disclosure. The cardiovascular-related proteins are typically selected based on an experimental association of the cardiovascular-related protein to the development of cardiovascular disease. For example, the production rate or circulating concentration of a cardiovascular-related protein may be elevated or depressed in a population having a cardiovascular disorder relative to a population lacking the cardiovascular disorder. Differences in protein levels may be assessed using proteomic techniques including but not limited to Western blot, immunohistochemical staining, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and mass spectrometry. Alternatively, the cardiovascular-related proteins may be identified by obtaining gene expression profiles of the genes encoding the proteins using genomic techniques including but not limited to DNA microarray analysis, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). By way of example, the chromosomal sequence may comprise, but is not limited to, IL1B (interleukin 1, beta), XDH (xanthine dehydrogenase), TP53 (cathepsin PTGIR (prostaglandin 12 (prostacyclin) receptor (IP)), KCNJ11 (potassium inwardly-rectifying channel, subfamily J, INS (insulin), CRP (C-reactive CAPN5 (calpain (C.

Any of these sequences, may be a target for the CRISPR-Cas system, e.g., to address mutation. In an additional embodiment, the chromosomal sequence may further be selected from Pon1 (paraoxonase 1), the chromosomal sequences and proteins encoded by chromosomal sequences involved in cardiovascular disease may be chosen from CacnalC, Sod1, Pten, Ppar(alpha), Apo E, Leptin, and combinations thereof as target(s) for the CRISPR-Cas system.Treating Diseases of the Liver and Kidney The present invention also contemplates delivering the CRISPR-Cas system described herein, e.g. Cpf1 effector protein systems, to the liver and/or kidney. Delivery strategies to induce cellular uptake of the therapeutic nucleic acid include physical force or vector systems such as viral-, lipid- or complex-based delivery, or nanocarriers. From the initial applications with less possible clinical relevance, when nucleic acids were addressed to renal cells with hydrodynamic high pressure injection systemically, a wide range of gene therapeutic viral and non-viral carriers have been applied already to target posttranscriptional events in different animal kidney disease models in vivo (Csaba Revesz and Peter Hamar (2011). Delivery Methods to Target RNAs in the Kidney, Gene Therapy Applications, Prof. Chunsheng Kang (Ed.), ISBN: 978-953-307-541-9, InTech, Available from: www.intechopen.com/books/gene-therapy-applications/delivery-methods-to-target-rnas-inthe-kidney). Delivery methods to the kidney may include those in Yuan et al. (Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 295: F605-F617, 2008) investigated whether in vivo of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LO) pathway of arachidonate acid metabolism can ameliorate renal injury and diabetic nephropathy (DN) in a streptozotocininjected mouse model of type 1 diabetes. To achieve greater in vivo access and siRNA expression in the kidney, Yuan et al. used double-stranded 12/15-LO siRNA oligonucleotides conjugated with cholesterol. About 400 g of siRNA was injected subcutaneously into mice. The method of Yuang et al. may be applied to the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention contemplating a 1-2 g subcutaneous injection of CRISPR Cas conjugated with cholesterol to a human for delivery to the kidneys. Molitoris et al. (J Am Soc Nephrol 20: 1754-1764, 2009) exploited proximal tubule cells (PTCs), as the site of oligonucleotide reabsorption within the kidney to test the efficacy of siRNA targeted to p53, a pivotal protein in the apoptotic pathway, to prevent kidney injury. Naked synthetic siRNA to p53 injected intravenously 4 h after ischemic injury maximally protected both PTCs and kidney function. Molitoris et al.'s data indicates that rapid delivery of siRNA to proximal tubule cells follows intravenous administration. For dose-response analysis, rats were injected with doses of siP53, 0.33; 1, 3, or 5 mg/kg, given at the same four time points, resulting in cumulative doses of 1.32; 4, 12, and 20 mg/kg, respectively. All siRNA doses tested produced a SCr reducing effect on day one with higher doses being effective over approximately five days compared with PBS-treated ischemic control rats. The 12 and 20 mg/kg cumulative doses provided the best protective effect. The method of Molitoris et al. may be applied to the nucleic acid-targeting system of the present invention contemplating 12 and 20 mg/kg cumulative doses to a human for delivery to the kidneys. Thompson et al. (Nucleic Acid Therapeutics, Volume 22, Number 4, 2012) reports the toxicological and pharmacokinetic properties of the synthetic, small interfering RNA I5NP following intravenous administration in rodents and nonhuman primates. I5NP is designed to act via the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway to temporarily inhibit expression of the pro-apoptotic protein p53 and is being developed to protect cells from acute ischemia/reperfusion injuries such as acute kidney injury that can occur during major cardiac surgery and delayed graft function that can occur following renal transplantation. Doses of 800 mg/kg I5NP in rodents, and 1,000 mg/kg I5NP in nonhuman primates, may be needed to elicit adverse effects, which in the monkey were isolated to direct effects on the blood that included a sub-clinical activation of complement and slightly increased clotting times. In the rat, no additional adverse effects were observed with a rat analogue of I5NP, indicating that the effects likely represent class effects of synthetic RNA duplexes rather than toxicity related to the intended pharmacologic activity of I5NP. Taken together, these data support clinical testing of intravenous administration of I5NP for the preservation of renal function following acute ischemia/reperfusion injury. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in the monkey was 500 mg/kg. No effects on cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurologic parameters were observed in monkeys following i.v. administration at dose levels up to 25 mg/kg. Therefore, a similar dosage may be contemplated for intravenous administration of CRISPR Cas to the kidneys of a human. Shimizu et al. (J Am Soc Nephrol 21: 622-633, 2010) developed a system to target delivery of siRNAs to glomeruli via poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(L-lysine)-based vehicles. The siRNA/nanocarrier complex was approximately 10 to 20 nm in diameter, a size that would allow it to move across the fenestrated endothelium to access to the mesangium. After intraperitoneal injection of fluorescence-labeled siRNA/nanocarrier complexes, Shimizu et al. detected siRNAs in the blood circulation for a prolonged time. Repeated intraperitoneal administration of a mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) siRNA/nanocarrier complex suppressed glomerular MAPK1 mRNA and protein expression in a mouse model of glomerulonephritis. For the investigation of siRNA accumulation, Cy-labeled siRNAs complexed with PIC nanocarriers nmol siRNA content), naked (0.5 of siRNA content) were administrated to BALBc mice. The method of Shimizu et al. may be applied to the nucleic acid-targeting system of the present invention contemplating a dose of about of 10-20 mol CRISPR Cas complexed with nanocarriers in about 1-2 liters to a human for intraperitoneal administration and delivery to the kidneys. Targeting liver cells is provided. This may be in vitro or in vivo. Hepatocytes are preferred. Delivery of the CRISPR protein, such as Cpf1 herein may be via viral vectors, especially AAV (and in particular AAV2/6) vectors. These may be administered by intravenous injection. A preferred target for liver, whether in vitro or in vivo, is the albumin gene. This is a so-called 'safe harbor\" as albumin is expressed at very high levels and so some reduction in the production of albumin following successful gene editing is tolerated. It is also preferred as the high levels of expression seen from the albumin promoter/enhancer allows for useful levels of correct or transgene production (from the inserted donor template) to be achieved even if only a small fraction of hepatocytes are edited. Intron 1 of albumin has been shown by Wechsler et al. (reported at the 57th Annual Meeting and Exposition of the American Society of Hematology\u2014abstract available online at ash.confex.com/ash/2015/webprogram/Paper86495.html and presented on 6th December 2015) to be a suitable target site. Their work used Zn Fingers to cut the DNA at this target site, and suitable guide sequences can be generated to guide cleavage at the same site by a CRISPR protein. The use of targets within highly-expressed genes (genes with highly active enhancers/promoters) such as albumin may also allow a promoterless donor template to be used, as reported by Wechsler et al. and this is also broadly applicable outside liver targeting. Other examples of highly-expressed genes are known.Other Disease of the Liver In particular embodiments, the CRISPR proteins of the present invention are used in the treatment of liver disorders such as transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and other hepatic-based inborn errors of metabolism. FAP is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes transthyretin (TTR). While it ia an autosomal dominant disease, not al carriers develop the disease. There are over 100 mutations in the TTR gene known to be associated with the disease. Examples of common mutations include V30M. The principle of treatment of TTR based on gene silencing has been demonstrated by studies with iRNA (Ueda et al. 2014 Transl Neurogener. 3:19). Wilson's Disease (WD) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding ATP7B, which is found exclusively in the hepatocyte. There are over 500 mutations associated with WD, with increased prevalence in specific regions such as East Asia. Other examples are A1ATD (an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene) and PKU (an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene).Liver-Associated Blood Disorders, Especially Hemophilia and in Particular Hemophilia B Successful gene editing of hepatocytes has been achieved in mice (both in vitro and in vivo) and in non-human primates (in vivo), showing that treatment of blood disorders through gene editing/genome engineering in hepatocytes is feasible. In particular, expression of the human F9 (hF9) gene in hepatocytes has been shown in non-human primates indicating a treatment for Hemophillia B in humans. Wechsler et al. reported at the 57th Annual Meeting and Exposition of the American Society of Hematology (abstract presented 6th December 2015 and available online at ash.confex.com/ash/2015/webprogram/Paper86495.html) that they has successfully expressed human F9 (hF9) from hepatocytes in non-human primates through in vivo gene editing. This was achieved using 1) two zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) targeting intron 1 of the albumin locus, and 2) a human F9 donor template construct. The ZFNs and donor template were encoded on separate hepatotropic adeno-associated virus serotype 2/6 (AAV2/6) vectors injected intravenously, resulting in targeted insertion of a corrected copy of the hF9 gene into the albumin locus in a proportion of liver hepatocytes. The albumin locus was selected as a \"safe harbor\" as production of this most abundant plasma protein exceeds 10 g/day, and moderate reductions in those levels are well-tolerated. Genome edited hepatocytes produced normal hFIX (hF9) in therapeutic quantities, rather than albumin, driven by the highly active albumin enhancer/promoter. Targeted integration of the hF9 transgene at the albumin locus and splicing of this gene into the albumin transcript was shown. Mice studies: C57BL/6 mice were administered vehicle (n=20) or AAV2/6 vectors encoding mouse surrogate reagents at 1.0\u00d71013 vector genome (vg)/kg via tail vein injection. ELISA analysis of plasma hFIX in the treated mice showed peak levels of 50-1053 ng/mL that were sustained for the duration of the 6-month study. Analysis of FIX activity from mouse plasma confirmed bioactivity commensurate with expression levels. Non-human primate (NHP) studies: a single intravenous NHP targeted a resulted in >50 ng/mL (>1% of normal) in this large animal model. The use of higher AAV2/6 doses (up to 1.5\u00d71014 vg/kg) yielded plasma hFIX levels up to 1000 ng/ml (or 20% of normal) in several animals and up to 2000 ng/ml (or 50% of normal) in a single animal, for the duration of the study (3 months). The treatment was well tolerated in mice and NHPs, with no significant toxicological findings related to AAV2/6 ZFN+donor treatment in either species at therapeutic doses. Sangamo (CA, USA) has since applied to the FDA, and been granted, permission to conduct the world's first human clinical trial for an in vivo genome editing application. This follows on the back of the EMEA's approval of the Glybera gene therapy treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency. Accordingly, it is preferred, in some embodiments, that any or all of the following are used: AAV (especially AAV2/6) vectors, preferably administered by intravenous injection; Albumin as target for gene editing/insertion of intron 1 of albumin; human F9 donor template; and/or a promoterless donor template.Hemophilia B Accordingly, in some embodiments, it is preferred that the present invention is used to treat Hemophilia B. As such it is preferred that F9 (Factor IX) is targeted through provision of a suitable guide RNA. The enzyme and the guide may ideally be targeted to the liver where F9 is produced, although they can be delivered together or separately. A template is provided, in some embodiments, and that this is the human F9 gene. It will be appreciated that the hF9 template comprises the wt or 'correct' version of hF9 so that the treatment is effective. In some embodiments, a two-vector system may be used-one vector for the Cpf1 and one vector for the repair template(s). The repair template may include two or more repair templates, for example, two F9 sequences from different mammalian species. In some embodiments, both a mouse and human F9 sequence are provided. This is may be delivered to mice. Yang Yang, John White, McMenamin Deirdre, and Peter Bell, PhD, presenting at 58th Annual American Society of Hematology Meeting (November 2016), report that this increases potency and accuracy. The second vector inserted the human sequence of factor IX into the mouse genome. In some embodiments, the targeted insertion leads to the expression of a chimeric hyperactive factor IX protein. In some embodiments, this is under the control of the native mouse factor IX promoter. Injecting this two-component system (vector 1 and vector 2) into newborn and adult \"knock-out\" mice at increasing doses led to expression and activity of stable factor IX activity at normal (or even higher) levels for over four months. In the case of treating humans, a native human F9 promoter may be used instead. In some embodiments, the wt phenotype is restored. In an alternative embodiment, the hemophilia B version of F9 may be delivered so as to create a model organism, cell or cell line (for example a murine or non-human primate model organism, cell or cell line), the model organism, cell or cell line having or carrying the Hemophilia B phenotype, i.e. an inability to produce wt F9.Hemophilia A In some embodiments, the F9 (factor IX) gene may be replaced by the F8 (factor VIII) gene described above, leading to treatment of Hemophilia A (through provision of a correct F8 gene) and/or creation of a Hemophilia A model organism, cell or cell line (through provision of an incorrect, Hemophilia A version of the F8 gene).Hemophilia C In some embodiments, the F9 (factor IX) gene may be replaced by the F11 (factor XI) gene described above, leading to treatment of Hemophilia C (through provision of a correct F11 gene) and/or creation of a Hemophilia C model organism, cell or cell line (through provision of an incorrect, Hemophilia C version of the F11 gene).Transthyretin Amyloidosis Transthyretin is a protein, mainly produced in the liver, present in the serum and CSF which carries thyroxin hormone and retinol binding protein bound to retinol (Vitamin A). Over 120 different mutations can cause Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), a heritable genetic disorder wherein mutant forms of the protein aggregate in tissues, particularly the peripheral nervous system, causing polyneuropathy. Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is the most common TTR disorder and, in 2014, was thought to affect 47 per 100,000 people in Europe. A mutation in the TTR gene of Val30Met is thought be the most common mutation, causing an estimated 50% of FAP cases. In the absence a liver transplant, the only known cure to date, the disease is usually fatal within a decade of diagnosis. The majority of cases are monogenic. In mouse models of ATTR, the TTR gene may be edited in a dose dependent manner by the delivery of CRISPR/Cas9. In some embodiments, the Cpf1 is provided as mRNA. In some embodiments, Cpf1 mRNA and guide RNA are packaged in LNPs. A system comprising Cpf1 mRNA and guide RNA packaged in LNPs achieved up to 60% editing efficiency in the liver, with serum TTR levels being reduced by up to 80%. In some embodiments, therefore, Transthyretin is targeted, in particular correcting for the Val30Met mutation. In some embodiments, therefore, ATTR is treated.Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (A1AT) is a protein produced in the liver which primarily functions to decrease the activity of neutrophil elastase, an enzyme which degrades connective tissue, in the lungs. Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (ATTD) is a disease caused by mutation of the SERPINA1 gene, which encodes A1AT. Impaired production of AAT leads to a gradual degredation of the connective tissue of the lung resulting in emphysema like symptoms. Several mutations can cause ATTD, though the most common mutations are Glu342Lys (referred to as Z allele, wild-type is referred to as M) or Glu264Val (referred to as the S allele), and each allele contributes equally to the disease state, with two affected alleles resulting in more pronounced pathophysiology. These results not only resulted in degradation of the connective tissue of sensitive organs, such as the lung, but accumulation of the mutants in the liver can result in proteotoxicity. Current treatments focus on the replacement of AAT by injection of protein retrieved from donated human plasma. In severe cases a lung and/or liver transplant may be considered. The common variants of the disease are again monogenic. In some embodiments, the SERPINA1 gene is targeted. In some embodiments, the Glu342Lys mutation (referred to as Z allele, wild-type is referred to as M) or the Glu264Val mutation (referred to as the S allele) are corrected for. In some embodiments, therefore, the faulty gene would require replacement by the wild-type functioning gene. In some embodiments, a knockout and repair approach is required, so a repair template is provided. In the case of bi-allelic mutations, in some embodiments only one guide RNA would be required for homozygous mutations, but in the case of heterozygous mutations two guide RNAs may be required. Delivery is, in some embodiments, to the lung or liver.Inborn Errors of Metabolism Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are an umbrella group of diseases which affect metabolic processes. In some embodiments, an IEM is to be treated. The majority of these diseases are monogenic in nature (e.g. phenylketonuria) and the pathophysiology results from either the abnormal accumulation of substances which are inherently toxic, or mutations which result in an inability to synthesize essential substances. Depending on the nature of the IEM, CRISPR/Cpf1 may be used to facilitate a knock-out alone, or in combination with replacement of a faulty gene via a repair template. Exemplary diseases that may benefit from CRISPR/Cpf1 technology are, in some embodiments: primary hyperoxaluria type 1 argininosuccinic lyase deficiency, ornithine deficiency, phenylketonuria, or PKU, and maple syrup urine disease.Treating Epithelial and Lung Diseases The present invention also contemplates delivering the CRISPR-Cas system described herein, e.g. Cpf1 effector protein systems, to one or both lungs. Although AAV-2-based vectors were originally proposed for CFTR delivery to CF airways, other serotypes such as AAV-1, AAV-5, AAV-6, and AAV-9 exhibit improved gene transfer efficiency in a variety of models of the lung epithelium (see, e.g., Li et al., Molecular Therapy, vol. 17 no. 12, 2067-277 December 2009). AAV-1 was demonstrated to be 100-fold more efficient than AAV-2 and AAV-5 at transducing human epithelial transduced murine tracheal airway epithelia in vivo with an efficiency equal to that of AAV-5. Other studies have shown that AAV-5 is 50-fold more efficient than AAV-2 at gene delivery to human airway epithelium (HAE) in vitro and significantly more efficient in the mouse lung airway epithelium in vivo. AAV-6 has also been shown to be more efficient than AAV-2 in human airway epithelial cells in vitro and murine airways in vivo.8 The more recent isolate, AAV-9, was shown to display greater gene transfer efficiency than AAV-5 in murine nasal and alveolar epithelia in vivo with gene expression detected for over 9 months suggesting AAV may enable long-term gene expression in vivo, a desirable property for a CFTR gene delivery vector. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that AAV-9 could be readministered to the murine lung with no loss of CFTR expression and minimal immune consequences. CF and non-CF HAE cultures may be inoculated on the apical surface with 100 l of AAV vectors for hours (see, e.g., Li et al., Molecular Therapy, vol. 17 no. 12, 2067-277 December 2009). The MOI may vary from 1\u00d7103 to 4\u00d7105 vector genomes/cell, depending on virus concentration and purposes of the experiments. The above cited vectors are contemplated for the delivery and/or administration of the invention. Zamora et al. (Am J Respir Crit Care Med Vol 183. pp 531-538, 2011) reported an example of the application of an RNA interference therapeutic to the treatment of human infectious disease and also a randomized trial of an antiviral drug in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-infected lung transplant recipients. Zamora et al. performed a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial in LTX recipients with RSV respiratory tract infection. Patients were permitted to receive standard of care for RSV. Aerosolized ALN-RSVO1 (0.6 mg/kg) or placebo was administered daily for 3 days. This study demonstrates that an RNAi therapeutic targeting RSV can be safely administered to LTX recipients with RSV infection. Three daily doses of ALN-RSVO1 did not result in any exacerbation of respiratory tract symptoms or impairment of lung function and did not exhibit any systemic proinflammatory effects, such as induction of cytokines or CRP. Pharmacokinetics showed only low, transient systemic exposure after inhalation, consistent with preclinical animal data showing that ALN-RSVO1, administered intravenously or by inhalation, is rapidly cleared from the circulation through exonucleasemediated digestion and renal excretion. The method of Zamora et al. may be applied to the nucleic acid-targeting system of the present invention and an aerosolized CRISPR Cas, for example with a dosage of 0.6 mg/kg, may be contemplated for the present invention. Subjects treated for a lung disease may for example receive pharmaceutically effective amount of aerosolized AAV vector system per lung endobronchially delivered while spontaneously breathing. As such, aerosolized delivery is preferred for AAV delivery in general. An adenovirus or an AAV particle may be used for delivery. Suitable gene constructs, each operably linked to one or more regulatory sequences, may be cloned into the delivery vector. In this instance, the following constructs are provided as examples: Cbh or EF1a promoter for Cas (Cpf1), U6 or H1 promoter for guide RNA): A preferred arrangement is to use a CFTRdelta508 targeting guide, a repair template for deltaF508 mutation and a codon optimized Cpf1 enzyme, with optionally one or more nuclear localization signal or sequence(s) (NLS(s)), e.g., two (2) NLSs. Constructs without NLS are also envisaged.Treating Diseases of the Muscular System The present invention also contemplates delivering the CRISPR-Cas system described herein, e.g. Cpf1 effector protein systems, to muscle(s). Bortolanza et al. (Molecular Therapy vol. 19 no. 11, 2055-264 November 2011) shows that systemic delivery of RNA interference expression cassettes in the FRG1 mouse, after the onset of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), led to a dose-dependent long-term FRG1 knockdown without signs of toxicity. Bortolanza et al. found that a single intravenous injection of 5\u00d71012 vg of rAAV6-sh1FRG1 rescues muscle histopathology and muscle function of FRG1 mice. In detail, 200 l containing 2\u00d71012 or 5\u00d71012 vg of vector in physiological solution were injected into the tail vein using a 25-gauge Terumo syringe. The method of Bortolanza et al. may be applied to an AAV expressing CRISPR Cas and injected into humans at a dosage of about 2\u00d71015 or 2\u00d71016 vg of vector. Dumonceaux et al. (Molecular Therapy vol. 18 no. 5, 881-887 May 2010) inhibit the myostatin pathway using the technique of RNA interference directed against the myostatin receptor AcvRIIb mRNA (sh-AcvRIIb). The restoration of a the vectorized U7 exon-skipping technique (U7-DYS). Adeno-associated vectors carrying either the sh-AcvrIIb construct alone, the U7-DYS construct alone, or a combination of both constructs were injected in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of dystrophic mdx mice. The injections were performed with 1011 AAV viral genomes. The method of Dumonceaux et al. may be applied to an AAV expressing CRISPR Cas and injected into humans, for example, at a dosage of about 1014 to about 10 vg of vector. Kinouchi et al. (Gene Therapy (2008) 15, 1126-1130) report the effectiveness of in vivo siRNA delivery into skeletal muscles of normal or diseased mice through nanoparticle formation of chemically unmodified siRNAs with atelocollagen (ATCOL). ATCOL-mediated local application of siRNA targeting myostatin, a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth, in mouse skeletal muscles or intravenously, caused a marked increase in the muscle mass within a few weeks after application. These results imply that ATCOL-mediated application of siRNAs is a powerful tool for future therapeutic use for diseases including muscular atrophy. MstsiRNAs (final concentration, 10 mM) were mixed with ATCOL (final concentration for local administration, 0.5%) (AteloGene, Kohken, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After anesthesia of mice (20-week-old male C57BL/6) by Nembutal (25 mg/kg, i.p.), the was injected into the masseter and biceps femoris muscles. The method of Kinouchi et al. may be applied to CRISPR Cas and injected into a human, for example, at a dosage of about 500 to 1000 ml of a 40 M solution into the muscle. Hagstrom et al. (Molecular Therapy Vol. 10, No. 2, August 2004) describe an intravascular, nonviral methodology that enables efficient and repeatable delivery of nucleic acids to muscle cells (myofibers) throughout the limb muscles of mammals. The procedure involves the injection of naked plasmid DNA or siRNA into a distal vein of a limb that is transiently isolated by a tourniquet or blood pressure cuff Nucleic acid delivery to myofibers is facilitated by its rapid injection in sufficient volume to enable extravasation of the nucleic acid solution into muscle tissue. High levels of transgene expression in skeletal muscle were achieved in both small and large animals with minimal toxicity. Evidence of siRNA delivery to limb muscle was also obtained. For plasmid DNA intravenous injection into a rhesus monkey, a threeway stopcock was connected to two syringe pumps (Model PHD 2000; Harvard Instruments), each loaded with a single syringe. Five minutes after a papaverine injection, pDNA (15.5 to 25.7 mg in 40-100 ml saline) was injected at a rate of 1.7 or 2.0 ml/s. This could be scaled up for plasmid DNA expressing CRISPR Cas of the present invention with an injection of about 300 to 500 mg in 800 to 2000 ml saline for a human. For adenoviral vector injections into a rat, 2\u00d710 infectious particles were injected in 3 ml of normal saline solution (NSS). This could be scaled up for an adenoviral vector expressing CRISPR Cas of the present invention with an injection of about 1\u00d71013 infectious particles were injected in 10 liters of NSS for a human. For siRNA, a rat was injected into the great saphenous vein with 12.5 g of a siRNA and a primate was injected injected into the great saphenous vein with 750 g of a siRNA. This could be scaled up for a CRISPR Cas of the present invention, for example, with an injection of about 15 to about 50 mg into the great saphenous vein of a human. See also, for example, WO2013163628 A2, Genetic Correction of Mutated Genes, published application of Duke University describes efforts to correct, for example, a frameshift mutation which causes a premature stop codon and a truncated gene product that can be corrected via nuclease mediated non-homologous end joining such as those responsible for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, (\"DMD\") a recessive, fatal, X-linked disorder that results in muscle degeneration due to mutations in the dystrophin gene. The majority of dystrophin mutations that cause DMD are deletions of exons that disrupt the reading frame and cause premature translation termination in the dystrophin gene. Dystrophin is a cytoplasmic protein that provides structural stability to the dystroglycan complex of the cell membrane that is responsible for regulating muscle cell integrity and function. The dystrophin gene or \"DMD gene\" as used interchangeably herein is 2.2 megabases at locus Xp21. The primary transcription measures about 2,400 kb with the mature mRNA being about 14 kb. 79 exons code for the protein which is over 3500 amino acids. Exon 51 is frequently adjacent to frame-disrupting deletions in DMD patients and has been targeted in clinical trials for oligonucleotide-based exon skipping. A clinical trial for the exon 51 skipping compound eteplirsen recently reported a significant functional benefit across 48 weeks, with an average of 47% dystrophin positive fibers compared to baseline. Mutations in exon 51 are ideally suited for permanent correction by NHEJ-based genome editing. The methods of US Patent Publication No. 20130145487 assigned to Cellectis, which relates to meganuclease variants to cleave a target sequence from the human dystrophin gene (DMD), may also be modified to for the nucleic acid-targeting system of the present invention.Treating Diseases of the Skin The present invention also contemplates delivering the CRISPR-Cas system described herein, e.g. Cpf1 effector protein systems, to the skin. Hickerson et al. (Molecular Therapy-Nucleic Acids (2013) 2, e129) relates to a motorized microneedle array skin delivery device for delivering self-delivery (sd)-siRNA to human and murine skin. The primary challenge to translating siRNA-based skin therapeutics to the clinic is the development of effective delivery systems. Substantial effort has been invested in a variety of skin delivery technologies with limited success. In a clinical study in which skin was treated with siRNA, the exquisite pain associated with the hypodermic needle injection precluded enrollment of additional patients in the trial, highlighting the need for improved, more \"patient-friendly\" (i.e., little or no pain) delivery approaches. Microneedles represent an efficient way to deliver large charged cargos including siRNAs across the primary barrier, the stratum corneum, and are generally regarded as less painful than conventional hypodermic needles. Motorized \"stamp type\" microneedle devices, including the motorized microneedle array (MMNA) device used by Hickerson et al., have been shown to be safe in hairless mice studies and cause little or no pain as evidenced by (i) widespread use in the cosmetic industry and (ii) limited testing in which nearly all volunteers found use of the device to be much less painful than a flushot, suggesting siRNA delivery using this device will result in much less pain than was experienced in the previous clinical trial using hypodermic needle injections. The MMNA device (marketed as Triple-M or Tri-M by Bomtech Electronic Co, Seoul, South Korea) was adapted for delivery of siRNA to mouse and human skin. sd-siRNA solution (up to 300 l of 0.1 mg/ml RNA) was introduced into the chamber of the disposable Tri-M needle cartridge (Bomtech), which was set to a depth of 0.1 mm. For treating human skin, deidentified skin (obtained immediately following surgical procedures) was manually stretched and pinned to a cork platform before treatment. All intradermal injections were performed using an insulin syringe with a 28-gauge 0.5-inch needle. The MMNA device and method of Hickerson et al. could be used and/or adapted to deliver the CRISPR Cas of the present invention, for example, at a dosage of up to 300 l of 0.1 mg/ml CRISPR Cas to the skin. Leachman et al. (Molecular Therapy, vol. 18 no. 2, 442-446 February 2010) relates to a phase Ib clinical trial for treatment of a rare skin disorder pachyonychia congenita (PC), an autosomal dominant syndrome that includes a disabling plantar keratoderma, utilizing the first short-interfering RNA (siRNA)-based therapeutic for skin. This siRNA, called targets Zheng et al. (PNAS, Jul. 24, 2012, vol. 109, no. 30, 11975-11980) show that spherical nucleic acid nanoparticle conjugates (SNA-NCs), gold cores surrounded by a dense shell of highly oriented, covalently immobilized siRNA, freely penetrate almost 100% of keratinocytes in vitro, mouse skin, and human epidermis within hours after application. Zheng et al. demonstrated that a single application of 25 nM epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) SNA-NCs for 60 h demonstrate effective gene knockdown in human skin. A similar dosage may be contemplated for CRISPR Cas immobilized in SNA-NCs for administration to the skin.Cancer In some embodiments, the treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis of cancer is provided. The target is preferably one or more of the FAS, BID, CTLA4, PDCD1, CBLB, PTPN6, TRAC or TRBC genes. The cancer may be one or more of lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), B cell acute lymphocytic acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, (NHL), diffuse large myeloma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), neuroblastoma, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, melanoma, sarcoma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, astrocytoma, mesothelioma, head and neck cancer, and medulloblastoma. This may be implemented with engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell. This is described in WO2015161276, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference and described herein below. Target genes suitable for the treatment or prophylaxis of cancer may include, in some embodiments, those described in WO2015048577 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.Usher Syndrome or Retinitis Pigmentosa-39 In some embodiments, the treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis of Usher Syndrome or retinitis pigmentosa-39 is provided. The target is preferably the USH2A gene. In some embodiments, correction of a G deletion at position 2299 (2299deG) is provided. This is described in WO2015134812A1, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.Autoimmune and Inflammatory Disorders In some embodiments, autoimmune and inflammatory disorders are treated. These include Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), for example.Cystic Fibrosis (CF) In some embodiments, the treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is provided. The target is preferably the SCNN1A or the CFTR gene. This is described in WO2015157070, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Schwank et al. (Cell Stem Cell, 13:653-58, 2013) used CRISPR-Cas9 to correct a defect associated with cystic fibrosis in human stem cells. The team's target was the gene for an ion channel, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductor receptor (CFTR). A deletion in CFTR causes the protein to misfold in cystic fibrosis patients. Using cultured intestinal stem cells developed from cell samples from two children with cystic fibrosis, Schwank et al. were able to correct the defect using CRISPR along with a donor plasmid containing the reparative sequence to be inserted. The researchers then grew the cells into intestinal \"organoids,\" or miniature guts, and showed that they functioned normally. In this case, about half of clonal organoids underwent the proper genetic correction. In some embodiments, Cystic fibrosis is treated, for example. Delivery to the lungs is therefore preferred. The F508 mutation (delta-F508, full name CFTRAF508 or F508del-CFTR) is preferably corrected. In some embodiments, the targets may be ABCC7, CF or MRP7.Duchenne's Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a recessive, sex-linked muscle wasting disease that affects approximately 1 in 5000 males at birth. Mutations of the dystrophin gene result in an absence of dystrophin in skeletal muscle, where it normally functions to connect the cytoskeleton of the muscle fiber to the basal lamina. The absence of dystrophin caused be these mutations results in excessive calcium entry into the soma which causes the mitochondria to rupture, destroying the cell. Current treatments are focused on easing the symptoms of DMD, and the average life expetency is approximately 26 years. CRISPR/Cas9 efficacy as a treatment for certain types of DMD has been demonstrated in mouse models. In one such study, the muscular dystrophy phenotype was partially corrected in the mouse by knocking-out a mutant exon resulting in a functional protein (see Nelson et al. (2016) Science, Long et al. (2016) Science, and Tabebordbar et al. (2016) Science). In some embodiments, DMD is treated. In some embodiments, delivery is to the muscle by injection.Glycogen Storage Diseases, Including 1a Glycogen Storage Disease 1a is a genetic disease resulting from deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase. The deficiency impairs the ability of the liver to produce free glucose from glycogen and from gluconeogenesis. In some embodiments, the gene encoding the glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme is targeted. In some embodiments, Glycogen Storage Disease 1a is treated. In some embodiments, delivery is to the liver by encapsulation of the Cpf1 (in protein or mRNA form) in a lipid particle, such as an LNP. In some embodiments, Glycogen Storage Diseases, including 1a, are targeted and preferably treated, for example by targeting polynucleotides associated with the condition/disease/infection. The associated polynucleotides include DNA, which may include genes (where genes include any coding sequence and regulatory elements such as enhancers or promoters). In some embodiments, the associated also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), Hurler's disease, is a genetic disorder that results in the buildup of glycosaminoglycans (formerly known as mucopolysaccharides) due to a deficiency of alpha-L iduronidase, an enzyme responsible for the degradation of mucopolysaccharides in lysosomes. Hurler syndrome is often classified as a lysosomal storage disease, and is clinically related to Hunter Syndrome. Hunter syndrome is X-linked while Hurler syndrome is autosomal recessive. MPS I is divided into three subtypes based on severity of symptoms. All three types result from an absence of, or insufficient levels of, the enzyme -L-iduronidase. MPS I H or Hurler syndrome is the most severe of the MPS I subtypes. The other two types are MPS I S or Scheie syndrome and MPS I H-S or Hurler-Scheie syndrome. Children born to an MPS I parent carry a defective IDUA gene, which has been mapped to the 4p16.3 site on chromosome 4. The gene is named IDUA because of its iduronidase enzyme protein product. As of 2001, 52 different mutations in the IDUA gene have been shown to cause Hurler syndrome. Successful treatment of the mouse, dog, and cat models of MPS I by delivery of the iduronidase gene through retroviral, lentiviral, AAV, and even nonviral vectors. In some embodiments, the -L-iduronidase gene is targeted and a repair template preferably provided.HIV and AIDS In some embodiments, the treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis of HIV and AIDS is provided. The target is preferably the CCR5 gene in HIV. This is described in WO2015148670A1, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.Beta Thalassaemia In some embodiments, the treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis of Beta Thalassaemia is provided. The target is preferably the BCL11A gene. This is described in WO2015148860, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) In some embodiments, the treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is provided. The target is preferably the HBB or BCL11A gene. This is described in WO2015148863, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and 2 Herpesviridae are a family of viruses composed of linear double-stranded DNA genomes with 75-200 genes. For the purposes of gene editing, the most commonly studied family member is Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1), a virus which has a distinct number of advantages over other viral vectors (reviewed in Vannuci et al. (2003)). Thus, in some embodiments, the viral vector is an HSV viral vector. In some embodiments, the HSV viral vector is HSV-1. HSV-1 has a large genome of approximately 152 kb of double stranded DNA. This genome comprises of more than 80 genes, many of which can be replaced or removed, allowing a gene insert of between 30-150 kb. The viral vectors derived from HSV-1 are generally separated into 3 groups: replication-competant attenuated vectors, replication-incompetent recombinant vectors, and defective helper-dependent vectors known as amplicons. Gene transfer using HSV-1 as a vector has been demonstrated previously, for instance for the treatment of neuropathic pain (see, e.g., Wolfe et al. (2009) Gene Ther) and rheumatoid arthritis (see e.g., Burton et al. (2001) Stem Cells). Thus, in some embodiments, the viral vector is an HSV viral vector. In some embodiments, the HSV viral vector is HSV-1. In some embodiments, the vector is used for delivery of one or more CRISPR components. It may be particularly useful for delvery of the Cpf1 and one or more guide RNAs, for example 2 or more, 3 or more, or 4 or more guide RNAs. In some embodiments, the vector is threreorfore useful in a multiplex system. In some embodiments, this delivery is for the treatment of treatment of neuropathic pain or rheumatoid arthritis. In some embodiments, the treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis of HSV-1 (Herpes Simplex Virus 1) is provided. The target is preferably the UL19, UL30, UL48 or UL50 gene in HSV-1. This is described in WO2015153789, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In other embodiments, the treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis of HSV-2 (Herpes Simplex Virus 2) is provided. The target is preferably the UL19, UL30, UL48 or UL50 gene in HSV-2. This is described in WO2015153791, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In some embodiments, the treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis of Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) is provided. The target is preferably the MYOC gene. This is described in WO2015153780, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.Adoptive Cell Therapies The present invention also contemplates use of the compositions and systems described herein, e.g. Cpf1 effector protein systems, to modify cells for adoptive therapies. As used herein, \"ACT\", \"adoptive cell therapy\" and \"adoptive cell transfer\" may be used interchangeably. In certain embodiments, Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) can refer to the transfer of cells to a patient with the goal of transferring the functionality and characteristics into the new host by engraftment of the cells (see, e.g., Mettananda et al., Editing an -globin enhancer in primary human hematopoietic stem cells as a treatment for -thalassemia, Nat Commun. 2017 Sep. 4; 8(1):424). As used herein, the term \"engraft\" or \"engraftment\" refers to the process of cell incorporation into a tissue of interest in vivo through contact with existing cells of the tissue. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) can refer to the transfer of cells, most commonly immune-derived cells, back into the same patient or into a new recipient host with the goal of transferring the immunologic functionality and characteristics into the new host. If possible, use of autologous cells helps the recipient by minimizing GVHD issues. The adoptive transfer of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) (Zacharakis et al., (2018) Nat Med. 2018 June; 24(6):724-730; Besser et al., (2010) Clin. Cancer Res 16 (9) 2646-55; Dudley et al., (2002) Science 298 (5594): 850-4; and Dudley et al., (2005) Journal of Clinical Oncology 23 (10): 2346-57.) or genetically re-directed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Johnson et al., (2009) Blood 114 (3): 535-46; and Morgan et al., (2006) Science 314(5796) 126-9) has been used to successfully treat patients with advanced solid tumors, including melanoma, metastatic breast cancer and colorectal carcinoma, as well as patients with CD19-expressing hematologic malignancies (Kalos et al., (2011) (95): 95ra73). In certain embodiments, allogenic cells immune cells are transferred (see, e.g., Ren et al., (2017) Clin Cancer Res 23 (9) 2255-2266). As described further herein, allogenic cells can be edited to reduce alloreactivity and prevent graft-versus-host disease. Thus, use of allogenic cells allows for cells to be obtained from healthy donors and prepared for use in patients as opposed to preparing autologous cells from a patient after diagnosis. In certain embodiments, an antigen (such as a tumor antigen) to be targeted in adoptive cell therapy (such as particularly CAR or TCR T-cell therapy) of a disease (such as particularly of tumor or cancer) may be selected from a group consisting of: B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) (see, e.g., Friedman et al., Effective Targeting of Multiple BCMA-Expressing Hematological Malignancies by Anti-BCMA CAR T Cells, Hum Gene Ther. 2018 Mar. 8; Berdeja J G, et al. Durable clinical responses in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma: updated results from a multicenter study of bb2121 anti-Bcma CAR T cell therapy. Blood. 130:740; and Mouhieddine and Ghobrial, Immunotherapy in Multiple Myeloma: The Era of CAR T Cell Therapy, Hematologist, May-June 2018, Volume 15, issue 3); PSA (prostate-specific (TRP-2/intron 2); RAGE receptor for advanced glycation end products 1 (RAGE1); Renal ubiquitous 1, 2 (RUl, Heat (PSCA); Protease Serine epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); claudin 6 (CLDN6); Gprotein-coupled receptor class C group 5, member D (GPRC5D); chromosome X open reading cellular receptor 1 adrenoceptor beta 3 (ADRB3); pannexin 3 (PANX3); K 9 (LY6K); Olfactory receptor 51E2 (OR51E2); TCR Gamma Alternate Reading Frame Protein (TARP); Wilms tumor protein (WT1); ETS translocation-variant gene 6, located on chromosome 12p (ETV6-AML); sperm protein 17 (SPA17); X Antigen Family, Member 1A (XAGE1); angiopoietin-binding Antigen Recognized By T Cells-1 3 (SART, SART3); Paired member f (CD300LF); C-type lectin domain family 12 member A (CLECi2A); cell antigen (NA cDNA clone of patient M88); KG2D D) ligands; combination thereof. In certain embodiments, an antigen to be targeted in adoptive cell therapy (such as particularly CAR or TCR T-cell therapy) of a disease (such as particularly of tumor or cancer) is a tumor-specific antigen (TSA). In certain embodiments, an antigen to be targeted in adoptive cell therapy (such as particularly CAR or TCR T-cell therapy) of a disease (such as particularly of tumor or cancer) is a neoantigen. In certain embodiments, an antigen to be targeted in adoptive cell therapy (such as particularly CAR or TCR T-cell therapy) of a disease (such as particularly of tumor or cancer) is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA). In certain embodiments, an antigen to be targeted in adoptive cell therapy (such as particularly CAR or TCR T-cell therapy) of a disease (such as particularly of tumor or cancer) is a universal tumor antigen. In certain preferred embodiments, the universal tumor antigen is selected from the group consisting of: a human telomerase reverse transcriptase antigen (PSMA), p53, cyclin (D1), and any combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, an antigen (such as a tumor antigen) to be targeted in adoptive cell therapy (such as particularly CAR or TCR T-cell therapy) of a disease (such as particularly of tumor or cancer) may be selected from a group embodiments, the antigen may be CD19. For example, CD19 may be targeted in hematologic malignancies, such as in lymphomas, more particularly in B-cell lymphomas, such as without limitation in diffuse mediastinal b-cell mantle cell lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia including adult and pediatric ALL, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. For example, BCMA may be targeted in multiple myeloma or plasma cell leukemia (see, e.g., 2018 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual meeting Poster: Allogeneic Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells Targeting B Cell Maturation Antigen). For example, CLL1 may be targeted in acute myeloid leukemia. For example, MAGE A3, MAGE A6, SSX2, and/or KRAS may be tumors. For example, HPV E6 and/or HPV E7 may be targeted in cervical cancer or head and neck cancer. For example, WT1 may be targeted in acute myeloid (MDS), cancer, breast, pancreatic, ovarian or colorectal cancers, or mesothelioma. For example, CD22 may be targeted in B cell malignancies, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. For example, CD171 may be targeted in neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, or lung, pancreatic, or ovarian cancers. For example, RORI may be targeted in ROR1+ malignancies, including non-small cell lung cancer, triple negative breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, ALL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or mantle cell lymphoma. For example, MUC16 may be targeted in MUC16ecto+ epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. For example, CD70 may be targeted in both hematologic malignancies as well as in solid cancers such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC), gliomas (e.g., GBM), and head and neck cancers (HNSCC). CD70 is expressed in both hematologic malignancies as well as in solid cancers, while its expression in normal tissues is restricted to a subset of lymphoid cell types (see, e.g., 2018 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual meeting Poster: Allogeneic CRISPR Engineered Anti-CD70 CAR-T Cells Demonstrate Potent Preclinical Activity Against Both Solid and Hematological Cancer Cells). In general, CARs are comprised of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain, wherein the extracellular domain comprises an antigen-binding domain that is specific for a predetermined target. While the antigen-binding domain of a CAR is often an antibody or antibody fragment (e.g., a single chain variable fragment, scFv), the binding domain is not particularly limited so long as it results in specific recognition of a target. For example, in some embodiments, the antigen-binding domain may comprise a receptor, such that the CAR is capable of binding to the ligand of the receptor. Alternatively, the antigen-binding domain may comprise a ligand, such that the CAR is capable of binding the endogenous receptor of that ligand. The antigen-binding domain of a CAR is generally separated from the transmembrane domain by a hinge or spacer. The spacer is also not particularly limited, and it is designed to provide the CAR with flexibility. For example, a spacer domain may comprise a portion of a human Fc domain, including a portion of the CH3 domain, or the hinge region of any immunoglobulin, such as IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, or IgM, or variants thereof. Furthermore, the hinge region may be modified so as to prevent off-target binding by FcRs or other potential interfering objects. For example, the hinge may comprise an IgG4 Fc domain with or without a S228P, L235E, and/or N297Q mutation (according to Kabat numbering) in order to decrease binding to FCRs. Additional spacers/hinges include, but are not limited to, CD4, CD8, and CD28 hinge regions. The transmembrane domain of a CAR may be derived either from a natural or from a synthetic source. Where the source is natural, the domain may be derived from any membrane bound or transmembrane protein. Transmembrane regions of particular use in this disclosure may be derived from CD8, CD28, CD137, CD 154, TCR. Alternatively, the transmembrane domain may be synthetic, in which case it will comprise predominantly hydrophobic residues such as leucine and valine. Preferably a triplet of phenylalanine, tryptophan and valine will be found at each end of a synthetic transmembrane domain. Optionally, a short oligo- or polypeptide linker, preferably between 2 and 10 amino acids in length may form the linkage between the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic signaling domain of the CAR. A glycine-serine doublet provides a particularly suitable linker. Alternative CAR constructs may be characterized as belonging to successive generations. First-generation CARs typically consist of a single-chain variable fragment of an antibody specific for an antigen, for example comprising a VL linked to a VH of a specific antibody, linked by a flexible linker, for example by a CD8 hinge domain and a CD8 transmembrane domain, to the transmembrane and intracellular signaling domains of either CD3 or FcR see U.S. 5,912,172; 5,906,936). Second-generation CARs incorporate the intracellular domains of or more costimulatory molecules, such as CD28, OX40 (CD134), or 4-1BB (CD137) within the see U.S. Nos. 8,906,682; WO2014134165; PCT Publication No. WO2012079000). In certain embodiments, the primary signaling domain comprises a functional signaling domain of a protein selected from the group consisting of CD3 zeta, CD3 gamma, CD3 In certain preferred embodiments, the primary signaling domain comprises a functional signaling domain of CD3 or FcR. In certain embodiments, the one or more costimulatory signaling domains comprise a functional signaling domain of a protein selected, each independently, from the group the one or more costimulatory signaling domains comprise a functional signaling domain of a protein selected, each independently, from the group consisting of: 4-1BB, CD27, and CD28. In certain embodiments, a chimeric antigen receptor may have the design as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,446,190, comprising an intracellular domain of CD3 chain (such as amino acid residues 52-163 of the human CD3 zeta chain, as shown in SEQ ID NO: 14 of U.S. Pat. No. 7,446,190), a signaling region from CD28 and an antigen-binding element (or portion or domain; such as scFv). The CD28 portion, when between the zeta chain portion and the antigen-binding element, may suitably include the transmembrane and signaling domains of CD28 (such as amino acid residues 114-220 of SEQ ID NO: 10, full sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6 of U.S. Pat. No. 7,446,190; these can include the following portion of CD28 as set forth in Genbank identifier NM_006139 2 or 3): IEVMYPPPYLDNEKSNGTIIHVKGKHLCPSPLFPGPSKPFWVLVVVGGVLACYSLLVT VAFIIFWVRSKRSRLLHSDYMNMTPRRPGPTRKHYQPYAPPRDFAAYRS)) (SEQ. I.D. No. 3). Alternatively, when the zeta sequence lies between the CD28 sequence and the antigen-binding element, intracellular domain of CD28 can be used alone (such as amino sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 9 of U.S. Pat. No. 7,446,190). Hence, certain embodiments employ a CAR comprising (a) a zeta chain portion comprising the intracellular domain of human CD3 chain, (b) a costimulatory signaling region, and (c) an antigen-binding element (or portion or domain), wherein the costimulatory signaling region comprises the amino acid sequence encoded by SEQ ID NO: 6 of U.S. Pat. No. 7,446,190. Alternatively, costimulation may be orchestrated by expressing CARs in antigen-specific T cells, chosen so as to be activated and expanded following engagement of their native aPTCR, for example by antigen on professional antigen-presenting cells, with attendant costimulation. In addition, additional engineered receptors may be provided on the immunoresponsive cells, for example to improve targeting of a T-cell attack and/or minimize side effects By means of an example and without limitation, Kochenderfer et al., (2009) J Immunother. 32 (7): 689-702 described anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptors (CAR). FMC63-28Z CAR contained a single chain variable region moiety (scFv) recognizing CD19 derived from the FMC63 mouse hybridoma in Nicholson et al., (1997) Molecular Immunology 34: 1157-1165), a portion of the human CD28 molecule, and the intracellular component of the human TCR-(molecule. FMC63-CD828BBZ CAR contained the FMC63 scFv, the hinge and transmembrane regions of the CD8 molecule, the cytoplasmic portions of CD28 and 4-1BB, and the cytoplasmic component of the TCR-(molecule. The exact sequence of the CD28 molecule included in the FMC63-28Z CAR corresponded to Genbank identifier NM_006139; the sequence included all amino acids starting with the amino acid sequence IEVMYPPPY (SEQ. I.D. No. 2) and continuing all the way to the carboxy-terminus of the protein. To encode the anti-CD19 scFv component of the vector, the authors designed a DNA sequence which was based on a portion of a previously published CAR (Cooper et al., (2003) Blood 101: 1637-1644). This sequence encoded the following components in frame from the 5 end to the 3 end: an XhoI site, the human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor -chain signal sequence, the FMC63 light chain variable region (as in Nicholson et al., supra), a linker peptide (as in Cooper et al., supra), the FMC63 heavy chain variable region (as in Nicholson et al., supra), and a NotI site. A plasmid encoding this sequence was digested with XhoI and NotI. To form the MSGV-FMC63-28Z retroviral vector, the and NotI-digested fragment encoding the scFv was ligated into a second XhoI and NotI-digested fragment that encoded the MSGV retroviral backbone (as in Hughes et al., (2005) Human Gene Therapy 16: 457-472) as well as part of the extracellular portion of human CD28, the entire transmembrane and cytoplasmic portion of human CD28, and the cytoplasmic portion of the human TCR-(molecule (as in Maher et al., 2002) Nature Biotechnology 20: 70-75). The FMC63-28Z CAR is included in the KTE-C19 anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy product in development by Kite Pharma, Inc. for the treatment of inter alia patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Accordingly, in certain embodiments, cells intended for adoptive cell therapies, more particularly immunoresponsive cells such as T cells, may express the FMC63-28Z CAR as described by Kochenderfer et al. (supra). Hence, in certain embodiments, cells intended for adoptive cell therapies, more particularly immunoresponsive cells such as T cells, may comprise a CAR comprising an extracellular antigen-binding element (or portion or domain; such as scFv) that specifically binds to an antigen, an intracellular signaling domain comprising an intracellular domain of a CD3 chain, and a costimulatory signaling region comprising a signaling domain of CD28. Preferably, the CD28 amino acid sequence is as set forth in Genbank identifier NM_006139 (sequence version 1, 2 or 3) starting with the amino acid sequence IEVMYPPPY and continuing all the way to the carboxy-terminus of the protein. The sequence is reproduced herein: IEVMYPPPYLDNEKSNGTIIHVKGKHLCPSPLFPGPSKPFWVLVVVGGVLACYSLLVT VAFIIFWVRSKRSRLLHSDYMNMTPRRPGPTRKHYQPYAPPRDFAAYRS. Preferably, the antigen is CD19, more preferably the antigen-binding element is an anti-CD19 scFv, even more preferably the anti-CD19 scFv as described by Kochenderfer et al. (supra). Additional anti-CD19 CARs are further described in WO2015187528. More particularly Example 1 and Table 1 of WO2015187528, incorporated by reference herein, demonstrate the generation of anti-CD19 CARs based on a fully human anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody (47G4, as described in US20100104509) and murine anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody (as described in Nicholson et al. and explained above). Various combinations of a signal sequence (human CD8-alpha or GM-CSF receptor), extracellular and transmembrane chain) were disclosed. Hence, in certain embodiments, cells intended for adoptive cell therapies, more particularly immunoresponsive cells such as T cells, may comprise a CAR comprising an extracellular antigen-binding element that specifically binds to an antigen, an extracellular and transmembrane region as set forth in Table 1 of WO2015187528 and an intracellular T-cell signalling domain as set forth in Table 1 of WO2015187528. Preferably, the antigen is CD19, more preferably the antigen-binding element is an anti-CD19 scFv, even more preferably the mouse or human anti-CD19 scFv as described in Example 1 of WO2015187528. In certain embodiments, the CAR comprises, consists essentially of or consists of an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: ID NO: 12, or SEQ ID NO: 13 as set forth in Table 1 of WO2015187528. By means of an example and without limitation, chimeric antigen receptor that recognizes the CD70 antigen is described in WO2012058460A2 (see also, Park et al., CD70 as a target for chimeric antigen receptor T cells in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, Oral Oncol. 2018 March; 78:145-150; and Jin et al., CD70, a novel target of CAR T-cell therapy for gliomas, Neuro Oncol. 2018 Jan. 10; diffuse large B-cell and follicular lymphoma and also by the malignant cells of Hodgkins lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia et al., et al., J al., J Virol. addition, CD70 is expressed by non-hematological malignancies such as renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma. (Junker et al., J Urol. Res 2005; 65:5428-5438) CD70 expression is transient and restricted to a subset of highly activated T, B, and dendritic cells. By means of an example and without limitation, chimeric antigen receptor that recognizes BCMA has been embodiments, the immune cell may, in addition to a CAR or exogenous TCR as described herein, further comprise a chimeric inhibitory receptor (inhibitory CAR) that specifically binds to a second target antigen and is capable of inducing an inhibitory or immunosuppressive or repressive signal to the cell upon recognition of the second target antigen. In certain embodiments, the chimeric inhibitory receptor comprises an extracellular antigen-binding element (or portion or domain) configured to specifically bind to a target antigen, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular immunosuppressive or repressive signaling domain. In certain embodiments, the second target antigen is an antigen that is not expressed on the surface of a cancer cell or infected cell or the expression of which is downregulated on a cancer cell or an infected cell. In certain embodiments, the second target antigen is an MHC-class I molecule. In certain embodiments, the intracellular signaling domain comprises a functional signaling portion of an immune checkpoint molecule, such as for example PD-1 or CTLA4. Advantageously, the inclusion of such inhibitory CAR reduces the chance of the engineered immune cells attacking non-target (e.g., non-cancer) tissues. Alternatively, T-cells expressing CARs may be further modified to reduce or eliminate expression of endogenous TCRs in order to reduce off-target effects. Reduction or elimination of endogenous TCRs can reduce off-target effects and increase the effectiveness of the T cells (U.S. Pat. No. 9,181,527). T cells stably lacking expression of a functional TCR may be produced using a variety of approaches. T cells internalize, sort, and degrade the entire T cell receptor as a complex, with a half-life of about 10 hours in resting T cells and 3 hours in stimulated T cells (von Essen, M. et al. 2004. J. Immunol. 173:384-393). Proper functioning of the TCR complex requires the proper stoichiometric ratio of the proteins that compose the TCR complex. TCR function also requires two functioning TCR zeta proteins with ITAM motifs. The activation of the TCR upon engagement of its MHC-peptide ligand requires the engagement of several TCRs on the same T cell, which all must signal properly. Thus, if a TCR complex is destabilized with proteins that do not associate properly or cannot signal optimally, the T cell will not become activated sufficiently to begin a cellular response. Accordingly, in some embodiments, TCR expression may eliminated using RNA interference (e.g., shRNA, siRNA, miRNA, etc.), CRISPR, or other methods that target the nucleic acids encoding specific TCRs (e.g., TCR-c and TCR-0) and/or CD3 chains in primary T cells. By blocking expression of one or more of these proteins, the T cell will no longer produce one or more of the key components of the TCR complex, thereby destabilizing the TCR complex and preventing cell surface expression of a functional TCR. In some instances, CAR may also comprise a switch mechanism for controlling expression and/or activation of the CAR. For example, a CAR may comprise an extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domain, in which the extracellular domain comprises a target-specific binding element that comprises a label, binding domain, or tag that is specific for a molecule other than the target antigen that is expressed on or by a target cell. In such embodiments, the specificity of the CAR is provided by a second construct that comprises a target antigen binding domain (e.g., an scFv or a bispecific antibody that is specific for both the target antigen and the label or tag on the CAR) and a domain that is recognized by or binds to the label, binding domain, or tag on the CAR. See, e.g., WO 2013/044225, WO 2016/000304, WO 2015/057834, WO 2015/057852, WO 2016/070061, U.S. Pat. No. 9,233,125, US 2016/0129109. In this way, a T-cell that expresses the CAR can be administered to a subject, but the CAR cannot bind its target antigen until the second composition comprising an antigen-specific binding domain is administered. Alternative switch mechanisms include CARs that require multimerization in order to activate their signaling function (see, e.g., US 2015/0368342, US 2016/0175359, US 2015/0368360) and/or an exogenous signal, such as a small molecule drug (US 2016/0166613, Yung et al., Science, 2015), in order to elicit a T-cell response. Some CARs may also comprise a \"suicide switch\" to induce cell death of the CAR T-cells following treatment (Buddee et al., PLoS One, 2013) or to downregulate expression of the CAR following binding to the target antigen (WO 2016/011210). In certain embodiments, ACT includes co-transferring CD4+Th1 cells and CD8+ CTLs to induce a synergistic antitumour response (see, e.g., Li et al., Adoptive cell therapy with CD4+T helper 1 cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells enhances complete rejection of an established tumour, leading to generation of endogenous are transferred to a subject in need thereof. Th17 cells have been reported to directly eradicate melanoma tumors in mice to a greater extent than Th1 cells (Muranski P, et al., Tumor-specific Th17-polarized cells eradicate large established melanoma. Blood. 2008 Jul. 15; 112(2):362-73; and Martin-Orozco N, et al., T helper 17 cells promote cytotoxic T cell activation in tumor immunity. Immunity. 2009 Nov. 20; 31(5):787-98). Those studies involved an adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) therapy approach, which takes advantage of CD4+ T cells that express a TCR recognizing tyrosinase tumor antigen. Exploitation of the TCR leads to rapid expansion of Th17 populations to large numbers ex vivo for reinfusion into the autologous tumor-bearing hosts. In certain embodiments, ACT may include autologous iPSC-based vaccines, such as irradiated iPSCs in autologous anti-tumor vaccines (see e.g., Kooreman, Nigel G. et al., Autologous iPSC-Based Vaccines Elicit Anti-tumor Responses In Vivo, Cell Stem Cell 22, 1-13, 2018, doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2018.01.016). Unlike T-cell receptors (TCRs) that are MHC restricted, CARs can potentially bind any cell surface-expressed antigen and can thus be more universally used to treat patients (see Irving et al., Engineering Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cells for Racing in Solid Tumors: Don't Forget the Fuel, Front. Immunol., 3 Apr. 2017, doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00267). In certain embodiments, in the absence of endogenous T-cell infiltrate (e.g., due to aberrant antigen processing and presentation), which precludes the use of TIL therapy and immune checkpoint blockade, the transfer of CAR T-cells may be used to treat patients (see, e.g., Hinrichs C S, Rosenberg S A. Exploiting the curative potential of adoptive T-cell therapy for cancer. Immunol Rev (2014) 257(1):56-71. doi:10.1111/imr.12132). Approaches such as the foregoing may be adapted to provide methods of treating and/or increasing survival of a subject having a disease, such as a neoplasia, for example by administering an effective amount of an immunoresponsive cell comprising an antigen recognizing receptor that binds a selected antigen, wherein the binding activates the immunoresponsive cell, thereby treating or preventing the disease (such as a neoplasia, a pathogen infection, an autoimmune disorder, or an allogeneic transplant reaction). In certain embodiments, the treatment can be administered after lymphodepleting pretreatment in the form of chemotherapy (typically a combination of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) or radiation therapy. Initial studies in ACT had short lived responses and the transferred cells did not persist in vivo for very long (Houot et al., T-cell-based immunotherapy: adoptive cell transfer and checkpoint inhibition. Cancer Immunol Res (2015) 3(10):1115-22; and Kamta et al., Advancing Cancer Therapy with Present and Emerging Immuno-Oncology Approaches. Front. Oncol. (2017) 7:64). Immune suppressor cells like Tregs and MDSCs may attenuate the activity of transferred cells by outcompeting them for the necessary cytokines. Not being bound by a theory lymphodepleting pretreatment may eliminate the suppressor cells allowing the TILs to persist. In one embodiment, the treatment can be administrated into patients undergoing an immunosuppressive treatment (e.g., glucocorticoid treatment). The cells or population of cells, may be made resistant to at least one immunosuppressive agent due to the inactivation of a gene encoding a receptor for such immunosuppressive agent. In certain embodiments, the immunosuppressive treatment provides for the selection and expansion of the immunoresponsive T cells within the patient. In certain embodiments, the treatment can be administered before primary treatment (e.g., surgery or radiation therapy) to shrink a tumor before the primary treatment. In another embodiment, the treatment can be administered after primary treatment to remove any remaining cancer cells. In certain embodiments, immunometabolic barriers can be targeted therapeutically prior to and/or during ACT to enhance responses to ACT or CAR T-cell therapy and to support endogenous immunity (see, e.g., Irving et al., Engineering Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cells for Racing in Solid Tumors: Don't Forget the Fuel, Front. Immunol., 3 Apr. 2017, doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00267). In certain embodiments, editing may result in inactivation of a gene. By inactivating a gene, it is intended that the gene of interest is not expressed in a functional protein form. In a particular embodiment, the CRISPR system specifically catalyzes cleavage in one targeted gene thereby inactivating said targeted gene. The nucleic acid strand breaks caused are commonly repaired through the distinct mechanisms of homologous recombination or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). However, NHEJ is an imperfect repair process that often results in changes to the DNA sequence at the site of the cleavage. Repair via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) often results in small insertions or deletions (Indel) and can be used for the creation of specific gene knockouts. Cells in which a cleavage induced mutagenesis event has occurred can be identified and/or selected by well-known methods in the art. In certain embodiments, homology directed repair (HDR) is used to concurrently inactivate a gene (e.g., TRAC) and insert an endogenous TCR or CAR into the inactivated locus. Hence, in certain embodiments, editing of cells (such as by CRISPR/Cas), particularly cells intended for adoptive cell therapies, more particularly immunoresponsive cells such as T cells, may be performed to insert or knock-in an exogenous gene, such as an exogenous gene encoding a CAR or a TCR, at a preselected locus in a cell. Conventionally, nucleic acid molecules encoding CARs or TCRs are transfected or transduced to cells using randomly integrating vectors, which, depending on the site of integration, may lead to clonal expansion, oncogenic transformation, variegated transgene expression and/or transcriptional silencing of the transgene. Directing of transgene(s) to a specific locus in a cell can minimize or avoid such risks and advantageously provide for uniform expression of the transgene(s) by the cells. Without limitation, suitable 'safe harbor' loci for directed transgene integration include CCR5 or AAVS1. Homology-directed repair (HDR) strategies are known and described elsewhere in this specification allowing to insert transgenes into desired loci (e.g., TRAC locus). Further suitable loci for insertion of transgenes, in particular CAR or exogenous TCR transgenes, include without limitation loci comprising genes coding for constituents of endogenous T-cell receptor, such as T-cell receptor alpha locus (TRA) or T-cell receptor beta locus (TRB), for example T-cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC) locus, T-cell receptor beta constant 1 (TRBC1) locus constant 2 insertion of a transgene into such locus can simultaneously achieve expression of the transgene, potentially controlled by the endogenous promoter, and knock-out expression of the endogenous TCR. This approach has been exemplified in Eyquem et al., (2017) Nature 543: 113-117, wherein the authors used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to knock-in a DNA molecule encoding a CD19-specific CAR into the TRAC locus downstream of the endogenous promoter; the CAR-T cells obtained by CRISPR were significantly superior in terms of reduced tonic CAR signaling and exhaustion. Hence, in certain embodiments, editing of cells (such as by CRISPR/Cas), particularly cells intended for adoptive cell therapies, more particularly immunoresponsive cells such as T cells, may be performed to knock-out or knock-down expression of an endogenous TCR in a cell. For example, NHEJ-based or HDR-based gene editing approaches can be employed to disrupt the endogenous TCR alpha and/or beta chain genes. For example, gene editing system or systems, such as CRISPR/Cas system or systems, can be designed to target a sequence found within the TCR beta chain conserved between the beta 1 and beta 2 constant region genes (TRBC1 and TRBC2) and/or to target the constant region of the TCR alpha chain (TRAC) gene. In certain embodiments, editing of cells (such as by CRISPR/Cas), particularly cells intended for adoptive cell therapies, more particularly immunoresponsive cells such as T cells, may be performed to block an immune checkpoint, such as to knock-out or knock-down expression of an immune checkpoint protein or receptor in a cell. Immune checkpoints are inhibitory pathways that slow down or stop immune reactions and prevent excessive tissue damage from uncontrolled activity of immune cells. In certain embodiments, the immune checkpoint targeted is the programmed death-1 (PD-1 or CD279) gene (PDCD1). In other embodiments, the immune checkpoint targeted is cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA-4). In additional embodiments, the immune checkpoint targeted is another member of the CD28 and CTLA4 Ig superfamily such as BTLA, LAG3, ICOS, PDL1 or KIR. In further additional embodiments, the immune checkpoint targeted is a member of the TNFR superfamily such as CD40, OX40, CD137, GITR, CD27 or By means of an example and without limitation, WO2016196388 concerns an engineered T cell comprising (a) a genetically engineered antigen receptor that specifically binds to an antigen, which receptor may be a CAR; and (b) a disrupted gene encoding a PD-L1, an agent for disruption of a gene encoding a PD-L1, and/or disruption of a gene encoding PD-L1, wherein the disruption of the gene may be mediated by a gene editing nuclease, a zinc finger nuclease (ZFN), CRISPR/Cas9 and/or TALEN. WO2015142675 relates to immune effector cells comprising a CAR in combination with an agent (such as CRISPR, TALEN or ZFN) that increases the efficacy of the immune effector cells in the treatment of cancer, wherein the agent may inhibit an immune inhibitory molecule, Clin Cancer Res 23 (9) 2255-2266 performed lentiviral delivery of CAR and electro-transfer simultaneously, to generate gene-disrupted allogeneic CAR T cells deficient of TCR, HLA class I molecule and PD1. In certain embodiments, cells may be engineered to express a CAR, wherein expression and/or function of methylcytosine dioxygenase genes (TET1, TET2 and/or TET3) in the cells has been reduced or eliminated, such as by CRISPR, ZNF or TALEN (for example, as described in WO201704916). In certain embodiments, editing of cells (such as by CRISPR/Cas), particularly cells intended for adoptive cell therapies, more particularly immunoresponsive cells such as T cells, may be performed to knock-out or knock-down expression of an endogenous gene in a cell, said endogenous gene encoding an antigen targeted by an exogenous CAR or TCR, thereby reducing the likelihood of targeting of the engineered cells. In certain embodiments, the targeted antigen may be one or more antigen selected from the group consisting (TACI), and B-cell (BAFF-R) (for example, as described in WO2016011210 and WO2017011804). In certain embodiments, editing of cells (such as by CRISPR/Cas), particularly cells intended for adoptive cell therapies, more particularly immunoresponsive cells such as T cells, may be performed to knock-out or knock-down expression of one or more MHC constituent proteins, such as one or more HLA proteins and/or beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), in a cell, whereby rejection of non-autologous (e.g., allogeneic) cells by the recipient's immune system can be reduced or avoided. In preferred embodiments, one or more HLA class I proteins, such as HLA-A, B and/or C, and/or B2M may be knocked-out or knocked-down. Preferably, B2M may be knocked-out or knocked-down. By means of an example, Ren et al., (2017) Clin Cancer Res 23 (9) 2255-2266 performed lentiviral delivery of CAR and electro-transfer of targeting endogenous PD1 simultaneously, to generate gene-disrupted allogeneic CAR T cells deficient of TCR, HLA class I molecule and PD1. In certain embodiments, a cell may be multiply edited (multiplex genome editing) as taught herein to (1) knock-out or knock-down expression of an endogenous TCR (for example, TRBC1, TRBC2 and/or TRAC), (2) knock-out or knock-down expression of an immune checkpoint protein or receptor (for example PD1, PD-L1 and/or CTLA4); and (3) knock-out or knock-down expression of one or more MHC constituent proteins (for example, HLA-A, B and/or C, and/or B2M, preferably B2M). Immune cells may be obtained using any method known in the art. In one embodiment, allogenic T cells may be obtained from healthy subjects. In one embodiment T cells that have infiltrated a tumor are isolated. T cells may be removed during surgery. T cells may be isolated after removal of tumor tissue by biopsy. T cells may be isolated by any means known in the art. In one embodiment, T cells are obtained by apheresis. In one embodiment, the method may comprise obtaining a bulk population of T cells from a tumor sample by any suitable method known in the art. For example, a bulk population of T cells can be obtained from a tumor sample by dissociating the tumor sample into a cell suspension from which specific cell populations can be selected. Suitable methods of obtaining a bulk population of T cells may include, but are not limited to, any one or more of mechanically dissociating (e.g., mincing) the tumor, enzymatically dissociating (e.g., digesting) the tumor, and aspiration (e.g., as with a needle). The bulk population of T cells obtained from a tumor sample may comprise any suitable type of T cell. Preferably, the bulk population of T cells obtained from a tumor sample comprises tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The tumor sample may be obtained from any mammal. Unless stated otherwise, as used herein, the term \"mammal\" refers to any mammal including, but not limited to, mammals of the order Logomorpha, such as rabbits; the order Carnivora, including Felines (cats) and Canines (dogs); the order Artiodactyla, including Bovines (cows) and Swines (pigs); or of the order Perssodactyla, including Equines (horses). The mammals may be non-human primates, e.g., of the order Primates, Ceboids, or Simoids (monkeys) or of the order Anthropoids (humans and apes). In some embodiments, the mammal may be a mammal of the order Rodentia, such as mice and hamsters. Preferably, the mammal is a non-human primate or a human. An especially preferred mammal is the human. T cells can be obtained from a number of sources, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), bone marrow, lymph node tissue, spleen tissue, and tumors. In certain embodiments of the present invention, T cells can be obtained from a unit of blood collected from a subject using any number of techniques known to the skilled artisan, such as Ficoll separation. In one preferred embodiment, cells from the circulating blood of an individual are obtained by apheresis or leukapheresis. The apheresis product typically contains lymphocytes, including T cells, monocytes, granulocytes, B cells, other nucleated white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. In one embodiment, the cells collected by apheresis may be washed to remove the plasma fraction and to place the cells in an appropriate buffer or media for subsequent processing steps. In one embodiment of the invention, the cells are washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In an alternative embodiment, the wash solution lacks calcium and may lack magnesium or may lack many if not all divalent cations. Initial activation steps in the absence of calcium lead to magnified activation. As those of ordinary skill in the art would readily appreciate a washing step may be accomplished by methods known to those in the art, such as by using a semi-automated \"flow-through\" centrifuge (for example, the Cobe 2991 cell processor) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing, the cells may be resuspended in a variety of biocompatible buffers, such as, for example, Ca-free, Mg-free PBS. Alternatively, the undesirable components of the apheresis sample may be removed and the cells directly resuspended in culture media. In another embodiment, T cells are isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes by lysing the red blood cells and depleting the monocytes, for example, by centrifugation through a PERCOLL gradient. A specific subpopulation of T cells, such as CD28+, CD4+, CDC, CD45RA+, and CD45RO+ T cells, can be further isolated by positive or negative selection techniques. For example, in one preferred embodiment, T cells are isolated by incubation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 (i.e., T, or XCYTE DYNABEADS for a time period sufficient for positive selection of the desired T cells. In one embodiment, the time period is about 30 minutes. In a further embodiment, the time period ranges from 30 minutes to 36 hours or longer and all integer values there between. In a further embodiment, the time period is at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 hours. In yet another preferred embodiment, the time period is 10 to 24 hours. In one preferred embodiment, the incubation time period is 24 hours. For isolation of T cells from patients with leukemia, use of longer incubation times, such as 24 hours, can increase cell yield. Longer incubation times may be used to isolate T cells in any situation where there are few T cells as compared to other cell types, such in isolating tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from tumor tissue or from immunocompromised individuals. Further, use of longer incubation times can increase the efficiency of capture of CD8+ T cells. Enrichment of a T cell population by negative selection can be accomplished with a combination of antibodies directed to surface markers unique to the negatively selected cells. A preferred method is cell sorting and/or selection via negative magnetic immunoadherence or flow cytometry that uses a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies directed to cell surface markers present on the cells negatively selected. For example, to enrich for CD4+ cells by negative selection, a monoclonal antibody cocktail typically includes antibodies to CD14, CD20, HLA-DR, and CD8. Further, monocyte populations (i.e., CD14+ cells) may be depleted from blood preparations by a variety of methodologies, including anti-CD14 coated beads or columns, or utilization of the phagocytotic activity of these cells to facilitate removal. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention uses paramagnetic particles of a size sufficient to be engulfed by phagocytotic monocytes. In certain embodiments, the paramagnetic particles are commercially available beads, for example, those produced by Life Technologies under the trade name Dynabeads. In one embodiment, other non-specific cells are removed by coating the paramagnetic particles with \"irrelevant\" proteins (e.g., serum proteins or antibodies). Irrelevant proteins and antibodies include those proteins and antibodies or fragments thereof that do not specifically target the T cells to be isolated. In certain embodiments, the irrelevant beads include beads coated with sheep anti-mouse antibodies, goat anti-mouse antibodies, and human serum albumin. In brief, such depletion of monocytes is performed by preincubating T cells isolated from whole blood, apheresed peripheral blood, or tumors with one or more varieties of irrelevant or non-antibody coupled paramagnetic particles at any amount that allows for removal of monocytes (approximately a 20:1 bead:cell ratio) for about 30 minutes to 2 hours at 22 to 37 degrees C., followed by magnetic removal of cells which have attached to or engulfed the paramagnetic particles. Such separation can be performed using standard methods available in the art. For example, any magnetic separation methodology may be used including a variety of which are commercially available, (e.g., DYNAL\u00ae Magnetic Particle Concentrator (DYNAL MPC\u00ae)). Assurance of requisite depletion can be monitored by a variety of methodologies known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including flow cytometric analysis of CD14 positive cells, before and after depletion. For isolation of a desired population of cells by positive or negative selection, the concentration of cells and surface (e.g., particles such as beads) can be varied. In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to significantly decrease the volume in which beads and cells are mixed together (i.e., increase the concentration of cells), to ensure maximum contact of cells and beads. For example, in one embodiment, a concentration of 2 billion cells/ml is used. In one embodiment, a concentration of 1 billion cells/ml is used. In a further embodiment, greater than 100 million cells/ml is used. In a further embodiment, a concentration of cells of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 million cells/ml is used. In yet another embodiment, a concentration of cells from 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 million cells/ml is used. In further embodiments, concentrations of 125 or 150 million cells/ml can be used. Using high concentrations can result in increased cell yield, cell activation, and cell expansion. Further, use of high cell concentrations allows more efficient capture of cells that may weakly express target antigens of interest, such as CD28-negative T cells, or from samples where there are many tumor cells present (i.e., leukemic blood, tumor tissue, etc). Such populations of cells may have therapeutic value and would be desirable to obtain. For example, using high concentration of cells allows more efficient selection of CD8+ T cells that normally have weaker CD28 expression. In a related embodiment, it may be desirable to use lower concentrations of cells. By significantly diluting the mixture of T cells and surface (e.g., particles such as beads), interactions between the particles and cells is minimized. This selects for cells that express high amounts of desired antigens to be bound to the particles. For example, CD4+ T cells express higher levels of CD28 and are more efficiently captured than CD8+ T cells in dilute concentrations. In one embodiment, the concentration of cells used is 5\u00d7106/ml. In other embodiments, the concentration used can be from about 1\u00d7105/ml to 1\u00d7106/ml, and any integer value in between. T cells can also be frozen. Wishing not to be bound by theory, the freeze and subsequent thaw step provides a more uniform product by removing granulocytes and to some extent monocytes in the cell population. After a washing step to remove plasma and platelets, the cells may be suspended in a freezing solution. While many freezing solutions and parameters are known in the art and will be useful in this context, one method involves using PBS containing 20% DMSO and 8% human serum albumin, or other suitable cell freezing media, the cells then are frozen to 80\u00b0 C. at a rate of 1 per minute and stored in the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen storage tank. Other methods of controlled freezing may be used as well as uncontrolled freezing immediately at 20\u00b0 C. or in liquid nitrogen. T cells for use in the present invention may also be antigen-specific T cells. For example, tumor-specific T cells can be used. In certain embodiments, antigen-specific T cells can be isolated from a patient of interest, such as a patient afflicted with a cancer or an infectious disease. In one embodiment, neoepitopes are determined for a subject and T cells specific to these antigens are isolated. Antigen-specific cells for use in expansion may also be generated in vitro using any number of methods known in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Patent Publication No. US 20040224402 entitled, Generation and Isolation of Antigen-Specific T Cells, or in U.S. Pat. No. 6,040,177. Antigen-specific cells for use in the present invention may also be generated using any number of methods known in the art, for example, as described in Current Protocols in Immunology, or Current Protocols in Cell Biology, both published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Boston, Mass. In a related embodiment, it may be desirable to sort or otherwise positively select (e.g. via magnetic selection) the antigen specific cells prior to or following one or two rounds of expansion. Sorting or positively selecting antigen-specific cells can be carried out using peptide-MHC tetramers (Altman, et al., Science. 1996 Oct. 4; 274(5284):94-6). In another embodiment, the adaptable tetramer technology approach is used (Andersen et al., 2012 Nat Protoc. 7:891-902). Tetramers are limited by the need to utilize predicted binding peptides based on prior hypotheses, and the restriction to specific HLAs. Peptide-MHC tetramers can be generated using techniques known in the art and can be made with any MHC molecule of interest and any antigen of interest as described herein. Specific epitopes to be used in this context can be identified using numerous assays known in the art. For example, the ability of a polypeptide to bind to MHC class I may be evaluated indirectly by monitoring the ability to promote incorporation of 1251 labeled P2-microglobulin (2m) into MHC class I/02m/peptide heterotrimeric complexes (see Parker et al., J. Immunol. 152:163, 1994). In one embodiment cells are directly labeled with an epitope-specific reagent for isolation by flow cytometry followed by characterization of phenotype and TCRs. In one embodiment, T cells are isolated by contacting with T cell specific antibodies. Sorting of antigen-specific T cells, or generally any cells of the present invention, can be carried out using any of a variety of commercially available cell sorters, including, but not limited to, MoFlo and FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.). In a preferred embodiment, the method comprises selecting cells that also express CD3. The method may comprise specifically selecting the cells in any suitable manner. Preferably, the selecting is carried out using flow cytometry. The flow cytometry may be carried out using any suitable method known in the art. The flow cytometry may employ any suitable antibodies and stains. Preferably, the antibody is chosen such that it specifically recognizes and binds to the particular biomarker being selected. For example, the specific selection of CD3, CD8, TIM-3, LAG-3, 4-1BB, anti-TIM-3, anti-LAG-3, anti-4-1BB, or anti-PD-1 antibodies, respectively. The antibody or antibodies may be conjugated to a bead (e.g., a magnetic bead) or to a fluorochrome. Preferably, the flow cytometry is fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). TCRs expressed on T cells can be selected based on reactivity to autologous tumors. Additionally, T cells that are reactive to tumors can be selected for based on markers using the methods described in patent publication Nos. WO2014133567 and WO2014133568, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. Additionally, activated T cells can be selected for based on surface expression of CD107a. In one embodiment of the invention, the method further comprises expanding the numbers of T cells in the enriched cell population. Such methods are described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,637,307 and is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. The numbers of T cells may be increased at least about 3-fold (or 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, or 9-fold), more preferably at least about 10-fold (or 20-, 30-, 40-, 50-, 60-, 70-, 80-, or 90-fold), more preferably at least about 100-fold, more preferably at least about 1,000 fold, or most preferably at least about 100,000-fold. The numbers of T cells may be expanded using any suitable method known in the art. Exemplary methods of expanding the numbers of cells are described in patent publication No. WO 2003057171, U.S. Pat. No. 8,034,334, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0244133, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, ex vivo T cell expansion can be performed by isolation of T cells and subsequent stimulation or activation followed by further expansion. In one embodiment of the invention, the T cells may be stimulated or activated by a single agent. In another embodiment, T cells are stimulated or activated with two agents, one that induces a primary signal and a second that is a co-stimulatory signal. Ligands useful for stimulating a single signal or stimulating a primary signal and an accessory molecule that stimulates a second signal may be used in soluble form. Ligands may be attached to the surface of a cell, to an Engineered Multivalent Signaling Platform (EMSP), or immobilized on a surface. In a preferred embodiment both primary and secondary agents are co-immobilized on a surface, for example a bead or a cell. In one embodiment, the molecule providing the primary activation signal may be a CD3 ligand, and the co-stimulatory molecule may be a CD28 ligand or 4-1BB ligand. In certain embodiments, T cells comprising a CAR or an exogenous TCR, may be manufactured as described in WO2015120096, by a method comprising: enriching a population of lymphocytes obtained from a donor subject; stimulating the population of lymphocytes with one or more T-cell stimulating agents to produce a population of activated T cells, wherein the stimulation is performed in a closed system using serum-free culture medium; transducing the population of activated T cells with a viral vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule which encodes the CAR or TCR, using a single cycle transduction to produce a population of transduced T cells, wherein the transduction is performed in a closed system using serum-free culture medium; and expanding the population of transduced T cells for a predetermined time to produce a population of engineered T cells, wherein the expansion is performed in a closed system using serum-free culture medium. In certain embodiments, T cells comprising a CAR or an exogenous TCR, may be manufactured as described in WO2015120096, by a method comprising: obtaining a population of lymphocytes; stimulating the population of lymphocytes with one or more stimulating agents to produce a population of activated T cells, wherein the stimulation is performed in a closed system using serum-free culture medium; transducing the population of activated T cells with a viral vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule which encodes the CAR or TCR, using at least one cycle transduction to produce a population of transduced T cells, wherein the transduction is performed in a closed system using serum-free culture medium; and expanding the population of transduced T cells to produce a population of engineered T cells, wherein the expansion is performed in a closed system using serum-free culture medium. The predetermined time for expanding the population of transduced T cells may be 3 days. The time from enriching the population of lymphocytes to producing the engineered T cells may be 6 days. The closed system may be a closed bag system. Further provided is population of T cells comprising a CAR or an exogenous TCR obtainable or obtained by said method, and a pharmaceutical composition comprising such cells. In certain embodiments, T cell maturation or differentiation in vitro may be delayed or inhibited by the method as described in WO2017070395, comprising contacting one or more T cells from a subject in need of a T cell therapy with an AKT inhibitor (such as, e.g., one or a combination of two or more AKT inhibitors disclosed in claim 8 of WO2017070395) and at least one of exogenous Interleukin-7 (IL-7) and exogenous Interleukin-15 (IL-15), wherein the resulting T cells exhibit delayed maturation or differentiation, and/or wherein the resulting T cells exhibit improved T cell function (such as, e.g., increased T cell proliferation; increased cytokine production; and/or increased cytolytic activity) relative to a T cell function of a T cell cultured in the absence of an AKT inhibitor. In certain embodiments, a patient in need of a T cell therapy may be conditioned by a method as described in WO2016191756 comprising administering to the patient a dose of cyclophosphamide between 200 mg/m2/day and 2000 mg/m2/day and a dose of fludarabine between 20 mg/m2/day and 900 mg/m2/day. Aspects of the invention accordingly involve the adoptive transfer of immune system cells, such as T cells, specific for selected antigens, such as tumor associated antigens (see Maus et al., 2014, Adoptive Immunotherapy for Cancer or Viruses, Annual Review of Immunology, Vol. 32: 189-225; Rosenberg and Restifo, 2015, Adoptive cell transfer as personalized immunotherapy for human cancer, Science Vol. 348 no. 6230 pp. 62-68; and, Restifo et al., 2015, Adoptive immunotherapy for cancer: harnessing the T cell response. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 12(4): 269-281; and Jenson and Riddell, 2014, Design and implementation of adoptive therapy with chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells. Immunol Rev. 257(1): 127-144); and Rajasagi et al., 2014, Systematic identification of personal tumor-specific neoantigens in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Blood. 2014 Jul. 17; 124(3):453-62). Various strategies may for example be employed to genetically modify T cells by altering the specificity of the T cell receptor (TCR) for example by introducing new TCR a and Rchains with selected peptide specificity (see U.S. 8,088,379). As an alternative to, or addition to, TCR modifications, chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) may be used in order to generate immunoresponsive cells, such as T cells, specific for selected targets, such as malignant cells, with a wide variety of receptor chimera constructs having been described (see U.S. Alternative CAR constructs may be characterized as belonging to successive generations. First-generation CARs typically consist of a single-chain variable fragment of an antibody specific for an antigen, for example comprising a VL linked to a VH of a specific antibody, linked by a flexible linker, for example by a CD8 hinge domain and a CD8 transmembrane domain, to the transmembrane and intracellular signaling domains of either CD3 or FcR see U.S. 5,912,172; 5,906,936). Second-generation CARs incorporate the intracellular domains of or more costimulatory molecules, such as CD28, OX40 (CD134), or 4-1BB (CD137) within the see U.S. Nos. 8,906,682; WO2014134165; PCT Publication No. W2012079000). Alternatively, costimulation may be orchestrated by expressing CARs in antigen-specific T cells, chosen so as to be activated and expanded following engagement of their native uPTCR, for example by antigen on professional antigen-presenting cells, with attendant costimulation. In addition, additional engineered receptors may be provided on the immunoresponsive cells, for example to improve targeting of a T-cell attack and/or minimize side effects. Alternative techniques may be used to transform target immunoresponsive cells, such as protoplast fusion, lipofection, transfection or electroporation. A wide variety of vectors may be used, such as retroviral vectors, lentiviral vectors, adenoviral vectors, adeno-associated viral vectors, plasmids or transposons, such as a Sleeping Beauty transposon (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,489,458; 7,148,203; 7,160,682; 7,985,739; 8,227,432), may be used to introduce CARs, for example using 2nd generation antigen-specific CARs signaling through CD3 and either CD28 or CD137. Viral vectors may for example include vectors based on HIV, SV40, EBV, HSV or BPV. Cells that are targeted for transformation may for example include T cells, Natural Killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), regulatory T cells, human embryonic stem cells, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) or a pluripotent stem cell from which lymphoid cells may be differentiated. T cells expressing a desired CAR may for example be selected through co-culture with -irradiated activating and propagating cells (AaPC), which co-express the cancer antigen and co-stimulatory molecules. The engineered CAR T-cells may be expanded, for example by co-culture on AaPC in presence of soluble factors, such as IL-2 and IL-21. This expansion may for example be carried out so as to provide memory CAR+ T cells (which may for example be assayed by non-enzymatic digital array and/or multi-panel flow cytometry). In this way, CAR T cells may be provided that have specific cytotoxic activity against antigen-bearing tumors (optionally in conjunction with production of desired chemokines such as interferon-7). CAR T cells of this kind may for example be used in animal models, for example to threat tumor xenografts. Approaches such as the foregoing may be adapted to provide methods of treating and/or increasing survival of a subject having a disease, such as a neoplasia, for example by administering an effective amount of an immunoresponsive cell comprising an antigen recognizing receptor that binds a selected antigen, wherein the binding activates the immunoreponsive cell, thereby treating or preventing the disease (such as a neoplasia, a pathogen infection, an autoimmune disorder, or an allogeneic transplant reaction). Dosing in CAR T cell therapies may for example involve administration of from 106 to 109 cells/kg, with or without a course of lymphodepletion, for example with cyclophosphamide. In one embodiment, the treatment can be administrated into patients undergoing an immunosuppressive treatment. The cells or population of cells, may be made resistant to at least one immunosuppressive agent due to the inactivation of a gene encoding a receptor for such immunosuppressive agent. Not being bound by a theory, the immunosuppressive treatment should help the selection and expansion of the immunoresponsive or T cells according to the invention within the patient. The administration of the cells or population of cells according to the present invention may be carried out in any convenient manner, including by aerosol inhalation, injection, ingestion, transfusion, implantation or transplantation. The cells or population of cells may be administered to a patient subcutaneously, intradermally, intratumorally, intraperitoneally. In one embodiment, the cell compositions of the present invention are preferably administered by intravenous injection. In some embodiments, the disclosed CARs may be delivered or administered into a cavity formed by the resection of tumor tissue (i.e. intracavity delivery) or directly into a tumor prior to resection (i.e. intratumoral delivery). In one embodiment, the cell compositions of the present invention are preferably administered by intravenous injection. The administration of the cells or population of cells can consist of the administration of 104-109 cells per kg body weight, preferably 105 to 106 cells/kg body weight including all integer values of cell numbers within those ranges. Dosing in CAR T cell therapies may for example involve administration of from 106 to 109 cells/kg, with or without a course of lymphodepletion, for example with cyclophosphamide. The cells or population of cells can be administrated in one or more doses. In another embodiment, the effective amount of cells are administrated as a single dose. In another embodiment, the effective amount of cells are administrated as more than one dose over a period time. Timing of administration is within the judgment of managing physician and depends on the clinical condition of the patient. The cells or population of cells may be obtained from any source, such as a blood bank or a donor. While individual needs vary, determination of optimal ranges of effective amounts of a given cell type for a particular disease or conditions are within the skill of one in the art. An effective amount means an amount which provides a therapeutic or prophylactic benefit. The dosage administrated will be dependent upon the age, health and weight of the recipient, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of treatment and the nature of the effect desired. In another embodiment, the effective amount of cells or composition comprising those cells are administrated parenterally. The administration can be an intravenous administration. The administration can be directly done by injection within a tumor. To guard against possible adverse reactions, engineered immunoresponsive cells may be equipped with a transgenic safety switch, in the form of a transgene that renders the cells vulnerable to exposure to a specific signal. For example, the herpes simplex viral thymidine kinase (TK) gene may be used in this way, for example by introduction into allogeneic T lymphocytes used as donor lymphocyte infusions following stem cell transplantation (Greco, et al., Improving the safety of cell therapy with the TK-suicide gene. Front. Pharmacol. 2015; 6: 95). In such cells, administration of a nucleoside prodrug such as ganciclovir or acyclovir causes cell death. Alternative safety switch constructs include inducible caspase 9, for example triggered by administration of a small-molecule dimerizer that brings together two nonfunctional icasp9 molecules to form the active enzyme. A wide variety of alternative approaches to implementing cellular proliferation controls have been described (see U.S. Patent Publication No. 20130071414; PCT Patent Publication WO2011146862; PCT Patent Publication WO2014011987; PCT Patent Publication WO2013040371; Zhou et al. BLOOD, 2014, 123/25:3895-3905; Di Stasi et al., The New England Journal of Medicine 2011; 365:1673-1683; Sadelain M, The New England Journal of Medicine 2011; 365:1735-173; Ramos et al., Stem Cells 28(6):1107-15 (2010)). In a further refinement of adoptive therapies, genome editing may be used to tailor immunoresponsive cells to alternative implementations, for example providing edited CAR T cells (see Poirot et al., 2015, Multiplex genome edited T-cell manufacturing platform \"off-the-shelf\" adoptive T-cell (18): 3853; Ren et al., 2017, Multiplex genome editing to generate universal CAR T cells resistant to PD1 inhibition, Nov. et al., 2017, Molecular remission of infant B-ALL after infusion of universal TALEN gene-edited CAR T cells, Sci Transl Med. 2017 Jan. 25; 9(374); Legut, et al., 2018, CRISPR-mediated TCR replacement generates superior anticancer transgenic T cells. Blood, 131(3), 311-322; and Georgiadis et al., Long Terminal Repeat CRISPR-CAR-Coupled \"Universal\" T Cells Mediate Potent Anti-leukemic Effects, Molecular Therapy, In Press, Corrected Proof, Available online 6 Mar. 2018). Cells may be edited using any CRISPR system and method of use thereof as described herein. CRISPR systems may be delivered to an immune cell by any method described herein. In preferred embodiments, cells are edited ex vivo and transferred to a subject in need thereof. Immunoresponsive cells, CAR T cells or any cells used for adoptive cell transfer may be edited. Editing may be performed for example to insert or knock-in an exogenous gene, such as an exogenous gene encoding a CAR or a TCR, at a preselected locus in a cell (e.g. TRAC locus); to eliminate potential alloreactive T-cell receptors (TCR) or to prevent inappropriate pairing between endogenous and exogenous TCR chains, such as to knock-out or knock-down expression of an endogenous TCR in a cell; to disrupt the target of a chemotherapeutic agent in a cell; to block an immune checkpoint, such as to knock-out or knock-down expression of an immune checkpoint protein or receptor in a cell; to knock-out or knock-down expression of other gene or genes in a cell, the reduced expression or lack of expression of which can enhance the efficacy of adoptive therapies using the cell; to knock-out or knock-down expression of an endogenous gene in a cell, said endogenous gene encoding an antigen targeted by an exogenous CAR or TCR; to knock-out or knock-down expression of one or more MHC constituent proteins in a cell; to activate a T cell; to modulate cells such that the cells are resistant to exhaustion or dysfunction; and/or increase the differentiation and/or proliferation of functionally exhausted or dysfunctional CD8+ T-cells For example, immunoresponsive cells may be edited to delete expression of some or all of the class of HLA type II and/or type I molecules, or to knockout selected genes that may inhibit the desired immune response, such as the PD1 gene. Cells may be edited using any CRISPR system and method of use thereof as described herein. CRISPR systems may be delivered to an immune cell by any method described herein. In preferred embodiments, cells are edited ex vivo and transferred to a subject in need thereof. Immunoresponsive cells, CAR T cells or any cells used for adoptive cell transfer may be edited. Editing may be performed to eliminate potential alloreactive T-cell receptors (TCR), disrupt the target of a chemotherapeutic agent, block an immune checkpoint, activate a T cell, and/or increase the differentiation and/or proliferation of functionally exhausted or dysfunctional CD8+ T-cells WO2014191128). Editing may result in inactivation of a gene. By inactivating a gene it is intended that the gene of interest is not expressed in a functional protein form. In a particular embodiment, the CRISPR system specifically catalyzes cleavage in one targeted gene thereby inactivating said targeted gene. The nucleic acid strand breaks caused are commonly repaired through the distinct mechanisms of homologous recombination or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). However, NHEJ is an imperfect repair process that often results in changes to the DNA sequence at the site of the cleavage. Repair via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) often results in small insertions or deletions (Indel) and can be used for the creation of specific gene knockouts. Cells in which a cleavage induced mutagenesis event has occurred can be identified and/or selected by well-known methods in the art. T cell receptors (TCR) are cell surface receptors that participate in the activation of T cells in response to the presentation of antigen. The TCR is generally made from two chains, and , which assemble to form a heterodimer and associates with the CD3-transducing subunits to form the T cell receptor complex present on the cell surface. Each a and p chain of the TCR consists of an immunoglobulin-like N-terminal variable (V) and constant (C) region, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic region. As for immunoglobulin molecules, the variable region of the and chains are generated by V(D)J recombination, creating a large diversity of antigen specificities within the population of T cells. However, in contrast to immunoglobulins that recognize intact antigen, T cells are activated by processed peptide fragments in association with an MHC molecule, introducing an extra dimension to antigen recognition by T cells, known as MHC restriction. Recognition of MHC disparities between the donor and recipient through the T cell receptor leads to T cell proliferation and the potential development of graft versus host disease (GVHD). The inactivation of TCRa or TCRp can result in the elimination of the TCR from the surface of T cells preventing recognition of alloantigen and thus GVHD. However, TCR disruption generally results in the elimination of the CD3 signaling component and alters the means of further T cell expansion. Allogeneic cells are rapidly rejected by the host immune system. It has been demonstrated that, allogeneic leukocytes present in non-irradiated blood products will persist for no more than 5 to 6 days (Boni, Muranski et al. 2008 Blood 1; 112(12):4746-54). Thus, to prevent rejection of allogeneic cells, the host's immune system may need to be suppressed to some extent. However, in the case of adoptive cell transfer the use of immunosuppressive drugs also have a detrimental effect on the introduced therapeutic T cells. Therefore, to effectively use an adoptive immunotherapy approach in these conditions, the introduced cells would need to be resistant to the immunosuppressive treatment. Thus, in a particular embodiment, the present invention further comprises a step of modifying T cells to make them resistant to an immunosuppressive agent, preferably by inactivating at least one gene encoding a target for an immunosuppressive agent. An immunosuppressive agent is an agent that suppresses immune function by one of several mechanisms of action. An immunosuppressive agent can be, but is not limited to a calcineurin inhibitor, a target of rapamycin, an interleukin-2 receptor inhibitor an immunosuppressive antimetabolite. The present invention allows conferring immunosuppressive resistance to T cells for immunotherapy by inactivating the target of the immunosuppressive agent in T cells. As non-limiting examples, targets for an immunosuppressive agent can be a receptor for an immunosuppressive agent such as: CD52, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a FKBP family gene member and a cyclophilin family gene member. Immune checkpoints are inhibitory pathways that slow down or stop immune reactions and prevent excessive tissue damage from uncontrolled activity of immune cells. In certain embodiments, the immune checkpoint targeted is the programmed death-1 (PD-1 or CD279) gene (PDCD1). In other embodiments, the immune checkpoint targeted is cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA-4). In additional embodiments, the immune checkpoint targeted is another member of the CD28 and CTLA4 Ig superfamily such as BTLA, LAG3, ICOS, PDL1 or KIR. In further additional embodiments, the immune checkpoint targeted is a member of the TNFR superfamily such as CD40, OX40, domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) (Watson H A, et al., SHP-1: the next checkpoint target for cancer immunotherapy? Biochem Soc Trans. 2016 Apr. 15; 44(2):356-62). expressed inhibitory protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP). In T-cells, it is a negative regulator of antigen-dependent activation and proliferation. It is a cytosolic protein, and therefore not amenable to antibody-mediated therapies, but its role in activation and proliferation makes it an attractive target for genetic manipulation in adoptive transfer strategies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Immune checkpoints may also include T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT/Vstm3/WUCAM/VSIG9) and VISTA (Le Mercier I, et al., (2015) Beyond CTLA-4 and PD-1, the generation Z of negative checkpoint regulators. Front. Immunol. 6:418).

Systems of this kind may for example provide methods for altering eukaryotic germline cells, by introducing into the germline cell a nucleic acid sequence encoding an RNA-guided DNA nuclease and one or more guide RNAs. The guide RNAs may be designed to be complementary to one or more target locations on genomic DNA of the germline cell. The nucleic acid sequence encoding the RNA guided DNA nuclease and the nucleic acid sequence encoding the guide RNAs may be provided on constructs between flanking sequences, with promoters arranged such that the germline cell may express the RNA guided DNA nuclease and the guide RNAs, together with any desired cargo-encoding sequences that are also situated between the flanking sequences. The flanking sequences will typically include a sequence which is identical to a corresponding sequence on a selected target chromosome, so that the flanking sequences work with the components encoded by the construct to facilitate insertion of the foreign nucleic acid construct sequences into genomic DNA at a target cut site by mechanisms such as homologous recombination, to render the germline cell homozygous for the foreign nucleic acid sequence. In this way, gene-drive systems are capable of introgressing desired cargo genes throughout a breeding population (Gantz et al., 2015, Highly efficient Cas9-mediated gene drive for population modification of the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles stephensi, PNAS 2015, published ahead of print Nov. 23, 2015, doi:10.1073/pnas.1521077112; Esvelt et al., 2014, Concerning RNA-guided gene drives for the alteration of wild populations eLife 2014; 3:e03401). In select embodiments, target sequences may be selected which have few potential off-target sites in a genome. Targeting multiple sites within a target locus, using multiple guide RNAs, may increase the cutting frequency and hinder the evolution of drive resistant alleles. Truncated guide RNAs may reduce off-target cutting. Paired nickases may be used instead of a single nuclease, to further increase specificity. Gene drive constructs may include cargo sequences encoding transcriptional regulators, for example to activate homologous recombination genes and/or repress non-homologous end-joining. Target sites may be chosen within an essential gene, so that non-homologous end-joining events may cause lethality rather than creating a drive-resistant allele. The gene drive constructs can be engineered to function in a range of hosts at a range of temperatures (Cho et al. 2013, Rapid and Tunable Control of Protein Stability in Caenorhabditis elegans Using a Small Molecule, PLoS ONE 8(8): e72393. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0072393).Xenotransplantation The present invention also contemplates use of the CRISPR-Cas system described herein, e.g. Cpf1 effector protein systems, to provide RNA-guided DNA nucleases adapted to be used to provide modified tissues for transplantation. For example, RNA-guided DNA nucleases may be used to knockout, knockdown or disrupt selected genes in an animal, such as a transgenic pig (such as the human heme oxygenase-1 transgenic pig line), for example by disrupting expression of genes that encode epitopes recognized by the human immune system, i.e. xenoantigen genes. Candidate porcine genes for disruption may for example include (1,3)-galactosyltransferase and cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase genes (see PCT Patent Publication WO 2014/066505). In addition, genes encoding endogenous retroviruses may be disrupted, for example the genes encoding all porcine endogenous retroviruses (see Yang et al., 2015, Genome-wide porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs), pp. 1101-1104). In addition, RNA-guided DNA nucleases may be used to target a site for integration of additional genes in xenotransplant donor animals, such as a human CD55 gene to improve protection against hyperacute rejection. General Gene Therapy Considerations Examples of disease-associated genes and polynucleotides and disease specific information is available from McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, Md.) and National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine (Bethesda, Md.), available on the World Wide Web. Mutations in these genes and pathways can result in production of improper proteins or proteins in improper amounts which affect function. Further examples of genes, diseases and proteins are hereby incorporated by reference from U.S. Provisional application 61/736,527 filed Dec. 12, 2012. Such genes, proteins and pathways may be the target polynucleotide of a CRISPR complex of the present invention. Examples of disease-associated genes and polynucleotides are listed in Tables A and B. Examples of signaling biochemical pathway-associated genes and polynucleotides are listed in Table C. Embodiments of the invention also relate to methods and compositions related to knocking out genes, amplifying genes and repairing particular mutations associated with DNA repeat instability and neurological disorders (Robert D. Wells, Tetsuo Ashizawa, Genetic Instabilities and Neurological Diseases, Second Edition, Academic Press, Oct. 13, 2011\u2014Medical). Specific aspects of tandem repeat sequences have been found to be responsible for more than twenty human diseases (New insights into repeat instability: role of RNADNA hybrids. McIvor E I, Polak U, M. RNA Biol. 2010 September-October; 7(5):551-8). The present effector protein systems may be harnessed to correct these defects of genomic instability. Several further aspects of the invention relate to correcting defects associated with a wide range of genetic diseases which are further described on the website of the National Institutes of Health under the topic subsection Genetic Disorders (website at health.nih.gov/topic/GeneticDisorders). The genetic brain diseases may include but are not limited to Adrenoleukodystrophy, Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum, Aicardi Syndrome, Alpers' Disease, Disease, Barth Syndrome, CADASIL, Cerebellar Degeneration, Fabry's Disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Disease, Huntington's Disease Menkes Disease, Mitochondrial Myopathies and NINDS Colpocephaly. These diseases are further described on the website of the National Institutes of Health under the subsection Genetic Brain Disorders.Nucleic Acid Detection Cpf1 is also capable of is capable of robust nucleic acid detection. In certain embodiments, Cpf1 is converted to an nucleic acid binding protein (\"dead Cpf1; dCpf1) by inactivation of its nuclease activity. Converted to an nucleic acid binding protein, Cpf1 is useful for localizing other functional components to target nucleic acids in a sequence dependent manner. The components can be natural or synthetic. According to the invention dCpf1 is used to (i) bring effector modules to specific nucleic acids to modulate the function or transcription, which could be used for large-scale screening, construction of synthetic regulatory circuits and other purposes; (ii) fluorescently tag specific nucleic acids to visualize their trafficking and/or localization; (iii) alter nucleic acid localization through domains with affinity for specific subcellular compartments; and (iv) capture specific nucleic acids (through direct pull down of dC2c2 or use of dC2c2 to localize biotin ligase activity) to enrich for proximal molecular partners, including RNAs and proteins. dCpf1 can be used to i) organize components of a cell, ii) switch components or activities of a cell on or off, and iii) control cellular states based on the presence or amount of a specific transcript present in a cell. In exemplary embodiments, the invention provides split enzymes and reporter molecules, portions of which are provided in hybrid molecules comprising an nucleic acid-binding CRISPR effector, such as, but not limited to Cpf1. When brought into proximity in the presence of an nucleic acid in a cell, activity of the split reporter or enzyme is reconstituted and the activity can then be measured. A split enzyme reconstituted in such manner can detectably act on a cellular component and/or pathway, including but not limited to an endogenous component or pathway, or exogenous component or pathway. A split reporter reconstituted in such manner can provide a detectable signal, such as but not limited to fluorescent or other detectable moiety. In certain embodiments, a split proteolytic enzyme is provided which when reconstituted acts on one or more components (endogenous or exogenous) in a detectable manner. In one exemplary embodiment, there is provided a method of inducing programmed cell death upon detection of an nucleic acid species in a cell. It will be apparent how such a method could be used to ablate populations of cells, based for example, on the presence of virus in the cells. In one aspect, the invention provides a method of identifying, measuring, and/or modulating the state of a cell or tissue based on the presence or level of a particular nucleic acid in the cell or tissue. In one embodiment, the invention provides a CRISPR-based control system designed to modulate the presence and/or activity of a cellular system or component, which may be a natural or synthetic system or component, based on the presence of a selected nucleic acid species of interest. In general, the control system features an inactivated protein, enzyme or activity that is reconstituted when a selected nucleic acid species of interest is present. In an embodiment of the invention, reconstituting an inactivated protein, enzyme or activity involves bringing together inactive components to assemble an active complex. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention provides a non-naturally occurring or engineered composition comprising a CRIPSR protein linked to an inactive first portion of a proteolytic enzyme, wherein the proteolytic enzyme is activated when contacted or reconstituted with a complementary portion of the proteolytic enzyme. According to the invention, the complementary portion of the proteolytic enzyme is provided linked to a second CRISPR protein. Complementary means that taken together, the first portion and the second portion reconstitute function. In one such embodiment, a proteolytic enzyme split in two parts is provided. The enzyme may be split in any fashion such that the pieces of the enzyme possess little or no activity until contacted with one another. The enzyme can be split in multiple parts though a split into two parts is usually preferred, for example to minimize the number of CRISPR protein fusions. In certain embodiments, the parts taken together amount to the whole, i.e., the pieces of the protein or enzyme together makeup a whole protein or enzyme. In certain embodiments, the pieces of the protein or enzyme together make up less than a whole protein or enzyme, e.g. where not all of the protein need be present in the reassembled pieces in order for the protein or enzyme to function. In certain embodiments, the pieces of the protein or enzyme together make up more than the whole protein or enzyme, e.g., where the component pieces comprise extra amino acids that contribute to stability and do not block function. In short, the split protein or enzyme can be provided in any configuration that is active once the pieces are reconstituted. DNA-binding CRISPR proteins can be used where the intent is to detect DNA molecules, such as in a cell or test sample. For example, the system can be used to detect viral DNA. A system of the invention further includes guides for localizing the CRISPR proteins with linked enzyme portions on a transcript of interest that may be present in a cell or tissue. According, the system includes a first guide that binds to the first CRISPR protein and hybridizes to the transcript of interest and a second guide that binds to the second CRISPR protein and hybridizes to the nucleic acid of interest. In most embodiments, it is preferred that the first and second guide hybridize to the nucleic acid of interest at adjacent locations. The locations can be directly adjacent or separated by a few nucleotide, such as separated by Int, 2 nts, 3 nts, 4 nts, 5 nts, 6 nts, 7 nts, 8 nts, 9 nts, 10 nts, 11 nts, 12 nts, or more. In certain embodiments, the first and second guides can bind to locations separated on a nucleic acid by an expected stem loop. Though separated along the linear nucleic acid, the nucleic acid may take on a secondary structure that brings the guide target sequences into close proximity. In an embodiment of the invention, the proteolytic enzyme comprises a caspase. In an embodiment of the invention, the proteolytic enzyme comprises a initiator caspase, such as but not limited caspase 8 or caspase 9. Initiator caspases are generally inactive as a monomer and gain activity upon homodimerization. In an embodiment of the invention, the proteolytic enzyme comprises an effector caspase, such as but not limited to caspase 3 or caspase 7. Such initiator caspases are normally inactive until cleaved into fragments. Once cleaved the fragments associate to form an active enzyme. The caspase fragments. In one exemplary embodiment, the first portion of the proteolytic enzyme comprises caspase 3 p12 and the complementary portion of the proteolytic enzyme comprises caspase 3 p17. In an embodiment of the invention, the proteolytic enzyme is chosen to target a particular amino acid sequence and a substrate is chosen or engineered accordingly. A non-limiting example of such a protease is tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease. Accordingly, a substrate cleavable by TEV protease, which in some embodiments is engineered to be cleavable, serves as the system component acted upon by the protease. In one embodiment, the NEV protease substrate comprises a procaspase and one or more TEV cleavage sites. The procaspase can be, for example, caspase 3 or caspase 7 engineered to be cleavable by the reconstituted TEV protease. Once cleaved, the procaspase fragments are free to take on an active confirmation. In an embodiment of the invention, the TEV substrate comprises a fluorescent protein and a TEV cleavage site. In another embodiment, the TEV substrate comprises a luminescent protein and a TEV cleavage site. In certain embodiments, the TEV cleavage site provides for cleavage of the substrate such that the fluorescent or luminescent property of the substrate protein is lost upon cleavage. In certain embodiments, the fluorescent or luminescent protein can be modified, for example by appending a moiety which interferes with fluorescence or luminescence which is then cleaved when the TEV protease is reconstituted. According to the invention, there is provided a method of providing a proteolytic activity in a cell which contains a nucleic acid of interest, which comprises contacting the nucleic acid in the cell with a composition which comprises a first CRIPSR protein linked to an inactive first portion of a proteolytic enzyme, and a second CRISPR protein linked to the complementary portion of the proteolytic enzyme wherein the activity of the proteolytic enzyme is reconstituted when the first portion and the complementary portion of the protein are contacted, and a first guide that binds to the first CRISPR protein and hybridizes to a first target sequence of the nucleic acid, and a second guide that binds to the second CRISPR protein and hybridizes to a second target sequence of the nucleic acid.

When the target nucleic acid of interest is present, the first and second portions of the proteolytic enzyme are contacted and the proteolytic activity of the enzyme is reconstituted and induces cell death. In one such embodiment of the invention, the proteolytic enzyme is a caspase. another such embodiment, enzyme is TEV wherein is reconstituted, a TEV protease substrate is cleaved and/or activated. In an embodiment of the invention, the TEV protease substrate is an engineered procaspase such that when the TEV protease is reconstituted, the procaspase is cleaved and activated, whereby apoptosis occurs. In an embodiment of the invention, a proteolytically cleavable transcription factor can be combined with any downstream reporter gene of choice to yield 'transcription-coupled' reporter systems. In an embodiment, a split protease is used to cleave or expose a degron from a detectable substrate. According to the invention, there is provided a method of marking or identifying a cell which contains an nucleic acid of interest, which comprises contacting the nucleic acid in the cell with a composition which comprises a first CRIPSR protein linked to an inactive first portion of a proteolytic enzyme, a second CRISPR protein linked to the complementary portion of the enzyme wherein the enzyme activity of the proteolytic enzyme is reconstituted when the first portion and the complementary portion of the protein are contacted, a first guide that binds to the first CRISPR protein and hybridizes to a first target sequence of the nucleic acid, a second guide that binds to the second CRISPR protein and hybridizes to a second target sequence of the nucleic acid, and an indicator which is detectably cleaved by the reconstituted proteolytic enzyme. The first and second portions of the proteolytic enzyme are contacted when the nucleic acid of interest is present in the cell, whereby the activity of the proteolytic enzyme is reconstituted and the indicator is detectably cleaved. In one such embodiment, the detectable indicator is a fluorescent protein, such as, but not limited to green fluorescent protein. In another such embodiment of the invention, the detectable indicator is a luminescent protein, such as, but not limited to luciferase. In an embodiment, the split reporter is based on reconstitution of split fragments of Renilla reniformis luciferase (Rluc). In an embodiment of the invention, the split reporter is based on complementation between two nonfluorescent fragments of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP).Additional Crispr-Cas Development and Use Considerations The present invention may be further illustrated and extended based on aspects of CRISPR-Cas9 development and use as set forth in the following articles and particularly as relates to delivery of a CRISPR protein complex and uses of an RNA guided endonuclease in cells and organisms: - Multiplex genome engineering using CRISPR/Cas systems.

Their study further showed that Cas9 as converted into a nicking enzyme can be used to facilitate homology-directed repair in eukaryotic cells with minimal mutagenic activity. Additionally, their study demonstrated that multiple guide sequences can be encoded into a single CRISPR array to enable simultaneous editing of several at endogenous genomic loci sites within the mammalian genome, demonstrating easy programmability and wide applicability of the RNA-guided nuclease technology. This ability to use RNA to program sequence specific DNA cleavage in cells defined a new class of genome engineering tools. These studies further showed that other CRISPR loci are likely to be transplantable into mammalian cells and can also mediate mammalian genome cleavage. Importantly, it can be envisaged that several aspects of the CRISPR-Cas system can be further improved to increase its efficiency and versatility. - Jiang et al. used the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated Cas9 endonuclease complexed with the genomes of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. The approach relied on dual-RNA:Cas9-directed cleavage at the targeted genomic site to kill unmutated cells and circumvents the need for selectable markers or counter-selection systems. The study reported reprogramming dual-RNA:Cas9 specificity by changing the sequence of short CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to make single- and multinucleotide changes carried on editing templates. The study showed that simultaneous use of two crRNAs enabled multiplex mutagenesis. Furthermore, when the approach was used in combination with recombineering, in S. pneumoniae, nearly 100% of cells that were recovered using the described approach contained the desired mutation, and in E. coli, 65% that were recovered contained the mutation. - Wang et al. (2013) used the CRISPR-Cas system for the one-step generation of mice carrying mutations in multiple genes which were traditionally generated in multiple steps by sequential recombination in embryonic stem cells and/or time-consuming intercrossing of mice with a single mutation. The CRISPR-Cas system will greatly accelerate the in vivo study of functionally redundant genes and of epistatic gene interactions. - Konermann et al. (2013) addressed the need in the art for versatile and robust technologies that enable optical and chemical modulation of DNA-binding domains based CRISPR Cas9 enzyme and Activator Like Effectors - Ran et al. (2013-A) described an approach that combined a Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs to introduce targeted double-strand breaks. This addresses the issue of the Cas9 nuclease from the microbial CRISPR-Cas system being targeted to specific genomic loci by a guide sequence, which can tolerate certain mismatches to the DNA target and thereby promote undesired off-target mutagenesis. Because individual nicks in the genome are repaired with high fidelity, simultaneous nicking via appropriately offset guide RNAs may be needed for double-stranded breaks and extends the number of specifically recognized bases for target cleavage. The authors demonstrated that using paired nicking can reduce off-target activity by 50- to 1,500-fold in cell lines and to facilitate gene knockout in mouse zygotes without sacrificing on-target cleavage efficiency. This versatile strategy enables a wide variety of genome editing applications that require high specificity. - Hsu et al. (2013) characterized SpCas9 targeting specificity in human cells to inform the selection of target sites and avoid off-target effects. The study evaluated >700 guide RNA variants and indel authors that SpCas9 tolerates mismatches between guide RNA and target DNA at different positions in a sequence-dependent manner, sensitive to the number, position and distribution of mismatches. The authors further showed that SpCas9-mediated cleavage is unaffected by DNA methylation and that the dosage of SpCas9 and gRNA can be titrated to minimize off-target modification. Additionally, to facilitate mammalian genome engineering applications, the authors reported providing a web-based software tool to guide the selection and validation of target sequences as well as off-target analyses. - Ran et al. (2013-B) described a set of tools for Cas9-mediated genome editing via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) in mammalian cells, as well as generation of modified cell lines for downstream functional studies. To minimize off-target cleavage, the authors further described a double-nicking strategy using the Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs. The protocol provided by the authors experimentally derived guidelines for the selection of target sites, evaluation of cleavage efficiency and analysis of off-target activity. The studies showed that beginning with target design, gene modifications can be achieved within as little as 1-2 weeks, and modified clonal cell lines can be derived within 2-3 weeks. - Shalem et al. described a new way to interrogate gene function on a genome-wide scale. Their studies showed that delivery of a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (GeCKO) library targeted 18,080 genes with 64,751 unique guide sequences enabled both negative and positive selection screening in human cells. First, the authors showed use of the GeCKO library to identify genes essential for cell viability in cancer and pluripotent stem cells. Next, in a melanoma model, the authors screened for genes whose loss is involved in resistance to vemurafenib, a therapeutic that inhibits mutant protein kinase BRAF. Their studies showed that the highest-ranking candidates included previously validated genes NF1 and MED12 as well as novel hits NF2, CUL3, TADA2B, and TADA1. The authors observed a high level of consistency between independent guide RNAs targeting the same gene and a high rate of hit confirmation, and thus demonstrated the promise of genome-scale screening with Cas9. - Nishimasu et al. reported the crystal structure of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 in complex with sgRNA and its target DNA at 2.5 A\u00b0 resolution. The structure revealed a bilobed architecture composed of target recognition and nuclease lobes, accommodating the sgRNA:DNA heteroduplex in a positively charged groove at their interface. Whereas the recognition lobe is essential for binding sgRNA and DNA, the nuclease lobe contains the HNH and RuvC nuclease domains, which are properly positioned for cleavage of the complementary and non-complementary strands of the target DNA, respectively. The nuclease lobe also contains a carboxyl-terminal domain responsible for the interaction with the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). This high-resolution structure and accompanying functional analyses have revealed the molecular mechanism of RNA-guided DNA targeting by Cas9, thus paving the way for the rational design of new, versatile genome-editing technologies. - Wu et al. mapped genome-wide binding sites of a catalytically inactive Cas9 (sgRNAs) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). The authors showed that each of the four sgRNAs tested targets dCas9 to between tens and thousands of genomic sites, frequently characterized by a 5-nucleotide seed region in the sgRNA and an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Chromatin inaccessibility decreases dCas9 binding to other sites with matching seed sequences; thus 70% of off-target sites are associated with genes. The authors showed that targeted sequencing of 295 dCas9 binding sites in mESCs transfected with catalytically active Cas9 identified only one site mutated above background levels. The authors proposed a two-state model for Cas9 binding and cleavage, in which a seed match triggers binding but extensive pairing with target DNA may be needed for cleavage. - Platt et al. established a Cre-dependent Cas9 knockin mouse. The authors demonstrated in vivo as well as ex vivo genome editing using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-, lentivirus-, or particle-mediated delivery of guide RNA in neurons, immune cells, and endothelial cells. - Hsu et al.

(2014) relates to a pooled, loss-of-function genetic screening approach suitable for both positive and negative selection that uses a genome-scale lentiviral single guide RNA (sgRNA) library. - Doench et al. created a pool of sgRNAs, tiling across all possible target sites of a panel of six endogenous mouse and three endogenous human genes and quantitatively assessed their ability to produce null alleles of their target gene by antibody staining and flow cytometry. The authors showed that optimization of the PAM improved activity and also provided an on-line tool for designing sgRNAs. - Swiech et al. demonstrate that AAV-mediated SpCas9 genome editing can enable reverse genetic studies of gene function in the brain. - Konermann et al. (2015) discusses the ability to attach multiple effector domains, e.g., transcriptional activator, functional and epigenomic regulators at appropriate positions on the guide such as stem or tetraloop with and without linkers. - Zetsche et al. demonstrates that the Cas9 enzyme can be split into two and hence the assembly of Cas9 for activation can be controlled. - Chen et al. relates to multiplex screening by demonstrating that a genome-wide in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screen in mice reveals genes regulating lung metastasis. - Ran et al. (2015) relates to SaCas9 and its ability to edit genomes and demonstrates that one cannot extrapolate from biochemical assays. - Shalem et al. in catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) fusions are used to synthetically activate (CRISPRa) expression, showing. advances using Cas9 for genome-scale screens, including arrayed and pooled screens, knockout approaches that inactivate genomic loci and strategies that modulate transcriptional activity. - Xu et al. (2015) assessed the DNA sequence features that contribute to single guide RNA (sgRNA) efficiency in CRISPR-based screens. The authors explored efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and nucleotide preference at the cleavage site. The authors also found that the sequence preference for CRISPRi/a is substantially different from that for CRISPR/Cas9 knockout. - Parnas et al. (2015) introduced genome-wide pooled CRISPR-Cas9 libraries into dendritic cells (DCs) to identify genes that control the induction of tumor necrosis factor (Tnf) by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Known regulators of Tlr4 signaling and previously unknown candidates were identified and classified into three functional modules with distinct effects on the canonical responses to LPS. - Ramanan et al (2015) demonstrated cleavage of viral episomal DNA (cccDNA) in infected cells. The HBV genome exists in the nuclei of infected hepatocytes as a 3.2 kb double-stranded episomal DNA species called covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which is a key component in the HBV life cycle whose replication is not inhibited by current therapies. The authors showed that sgRNAs specifically targeting highly conserved regions of HBV robustly suppresses viral replication and depleted cccDNA. - Nishimasu et al. (2015) reported the crystal structures of SaCas9 in complex with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) and its double-stranded DNA targets, containing the 5-TTGAAT-3 PAM and the 5-TTGGGT-3 PAM. A structural comparison of SaCas9 with SpCas9 highlighted both structural conservation and divergence, explaining their distinct PAM specificities and orthologous sgRNA recognition. - Canver et al. (2015) demonstrated a CRISPR-Cas9-based functional investigation of non-coding genomic elements. The authors we developed pooled CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA libraries to perform in situ saturating mutagenesis of the human and mouse BCL11A enhancers which revealed critical features of the enhancers. - Zetsche et al. (2015) reported characterization of Cpf1, a class 2 CRISPR nuclease from Francisella novicida U112 RNA-guided endonuclease lacking tracrRNA, utilizes a T-rich protospacer-adjacent motif, and cleaves DNA via a staggered DNA double-stranded break. - Shmakov et al. (2015) reported three distinct Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems. Two system CRISPR enzymes (C2c1 and C2c3) on both and tracrRNA for DNA The third enzyme (C2c2) contains two predicted HEPN RNase domains and is tracrRNA independent. - Slaymaker et al (2016) reported the use of structure-guided protein engineering to improve the specificity of Streptococcus robust on-target cleavage reduced off-target effects. The methods and tools provided herein are exemplified for Cpf1, a type II nuclease that does not make use of tracrRNA. Orthologs of Cpf1 have been identified in different bacterial species as described herein. Further type II nucleases with similar properties can be identified using methods described in the art (Shmakov et al. 2015, 60:385-397; Abudayeh et al. 2016, Science, 5; 353(6299)). In particular embodiments, such methods for identifying novel CRISPR effector proteins may comprise the steps of selecting sequences from the database encoding a seed which identifies the presence of a CRISPR Cas locus, identifying loci located within 10 kb of the seed comprising Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in the selected sequences, selecting therefrom loci comprising ORFs of which only a single ORF encodes a novel CRISPR effector having greater than 700 amino acids and no more than 90% homology to a known CRISPR effector. In particular embodiments, the seed is a protein that is common to the CRISPR-Cas system, such as Cast. In further embodiments, the CRISPR array is used as a seed to identify new effector proteins. The effectiveness of the present invention has been demonstrated. Preassembled recombinant CRISPR-Cpf1 complexes comprising Cpf1 and crRNA may be transfected, for example by electroporation, resulting in high mutation rates and absence of detectable off-target mutations.

For example, wherein Cpf1 protein and sgRNA were mixed together at a suitable, e.g., 3:1 to 1:3 or 2:1 to 1:2 or 1:1 molar ratio, at a suitable temperature, e.g., 15-30C, e.g., 20-25C, e.g., room temperature, for a suitable time, e.g., 15-45, such as 30 minutes, advantageously in sterile, nuclease free buffer, e.g., 1\u00d7PBS. Separately, particle components such as or comprising: a surfactant, cationic lipid, e.g., 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP); dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC); biodegradable polymer, such as an ethylene-glycol polymer or PEG, and a lipoprotein, such as a low-density lipoprotein, e.g., cholesterol were dissolved in an alcohol, advantageously a C1-6 alkyl alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, e.g., 100% ethanol. The two solutions were mixed together to form particles containing the Cas9-sgRNA complexes. Accordingly, sgRNA may be pre-complexed with the Cpf1 protein, before formulating the entire complex in a particle. Formulations may be made with a different molar ratio of different components known to promote delivery of nucleic acids into cells (e.g. 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP), 1,2-ditetradecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and cholesterol) For DOTAP: DMPC:PEG:Cholesterol Molar Ratios may be DOTAP 100, DMPC 0, PEG 0, Cholesterol 0; or DOTAP 90, DMPC 0, PEG 10, Cholesterol 0; or DOTAP 90, DMPC 0, PEG 5, Cholesterol 5. DOTAP 100, DMPC 0, PEG 0, Cholesterol 0. That application accordingly comprehends admixing sgRNA, Cpf1 protein and components that form a particle; as well as particles from such admixing. Aspects of the instant invention can involve particles; for example, particles using a process analogous to that of the Particle Delivery PCT or that of the Eye PCT, e.g., by admixing a mixture comprising sgRNA and/or Cpf1 as in the instant invention and components that form a particle, e.g., as in the Particle Delivery PCT or in the Eye PCT, to form a particle and particles from such admixing (or, of course, other particles involving sgRNA and/or Cpf1 as in the instant invention).Computer Related Methods and Systems The subject invention may be used as part of a research program wherein there is transmission of results or data. A computer system (or digital device) may be used to receive, transmit, display and/or store results, analyze the data and/or results, and/or produce a report of the results and/or data and/or analysis. A computer system may be understood as a logical apparatus that can read instructions from media (e.g. software) and/or network port (e.g. from the internet), which can optionally be connected to a server having fixed media. A computer system may comprise one or more of a CPU, disk drives, input devices such as keyboard and/or mouse, and a display (e.g. a monitor). Data communication, such as transmission of instructions or reports, can be achieved through a communication medium to a server at a local or a remote location. The communication medium can include any means of transmitting and/or receiving data. For example, the communication medium can be a network connection, a wireless connection, or an internet connection. Such a connection can provide for communication over the World Wide Web. It is envisioned that data relating to the present invention can be transmitted over such networks or connections (or any other suitable means for transmitting information, including but not limited to mailing a physical report, such as a print-out) for reception and/or for review by a receiver. The receiver can be but is not limited to an individual, or electronic system (e.g. one or more computers, and/or one or more servers). In some embodiments, the computer system comprises one or more processors. Processors may be associated with one or more controllers, calculation units, and/or other units of a computer system, or implanted in firmware as desired. If implemented in software, the routines may be stored in any computer readable memory such as in RAM, ROM, flash memory, a magnetic disk, a laser disk, or other suitable storage medium. Likewise, this software may be delivered to a computing device via any known delivery method including, for example, over a communication channel such as a telephone line, the internet, a wireless connection, etc., or via a transportable medium, such as a computer readable disk, flash drive, etc. The various steps may be implemented as various blocks, operations, tools, modules and techniques which, in turn, may be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or any combination of hardware, firmware, and/or software. When implemented in hardware, some or all of the blocks, operations, techniques, etc. may be implemented in, for example, a custom integrated circuit (IC), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable logic array (FPGA), a programmable logic array (PLA), etc. A client-server, relational database architecture can be used in embodiments of the invention. A client-server architecture is a network architecture in which each computer or process on the network is either a client or a server. Server computers are typically powerful computers dedicated to managing disk drives (file servers), printers (print servers), or network traffic (network servers). Client computers include PCs (personal computers) or workstations on which users run applications, as well as example output devices as disclosed herein. Client computers rely on server computers for resources, such as files, devices, and even processing power. In some embodiments of the invention, the server computer handles all of the database functionality. The client computer can have software that handles all the front-end data management and can also receive data input from users. A machine readable medium comprising computer-executable code may take many forms, including but not limited to, a tangible storage medium, a carrier wave medium or physical transmission medium. Non-volatile storage media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as any of the storage devices in any computer(s) or the like, such as may be used to implement the databases, etc. shown in the drawings. Volatile storage media include dynamic memory, such as main memory of such a computer platform. Tangible transmission media include coaxial cables; copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise a bus within a computer system. Carrier-wave transmission media may take the form of electric or electromagnetic signals, or acoustic or light waves such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media therefore include for example: a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, DVD or DVD-ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards paper tape, any other physical storage medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a ROM, a PROM and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave transporting data or instructions, cables or links transporting such a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer may read programming code and/or data. Many of these forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to a processor for execution. Accordingly, the invention comprehends performing any method herein-discussed and storing and/or transmitting data and/or results therefrom and/or analysis thereof, as well as products from performing any method herein-discussed, including intermediates.Examples of Diseases and Target Loci Throughout this disclosure there has been mention of CRISPR or CRISPR-Cas complexes or systems. CRISPR systems or complexes can target nucleic acid molecules, e.g., CRISPR-Cpf1 complexes can target and cleave or nick or simply sit upon a target DNA molecule (depending if the Cpf1 has mutations that render it a nickase or \"dead\"). Such systems or complexes are amenable for achieving tissue-specific and temporally controlled targeted deletion of candidate disease genes. Examples include but are not limited to genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, amyloid diseases, dominant negative diseases, latent viral infections, among other disorders. Accordingly, target sequences for such systems or complexes can be in candidate disease genes, e.g.: Thus, the present invention, with regard to CRISPR or CRISPR-Cas complexes contemplates correction of hematopoietic disorders. For example, Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID) results from a defect in lymphocytes T maturation, always associated with a functional defect in lymphocytes B (Cavazzana-Calvo et al., Annu. Rev. Med., 2005, 56, 585-602; Fischer et al., Immunol. Rev., 2005, 203, 98-109). In the case of Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) deficiency, one of the SCID forms, patients can be treated by injection of recombinant Adenosine Deaminase enzyme. Since the ADA gene has been shown to be mutated in SCID patients (Giblett et al., Lancet, 1972, 2, 1067-1069), several other genes involved in SCID have been identified (Cavazzana-Calvo et al., Annu. Rev. Med., 2005, 56, 585-602; Fischer et al., Immunol. Rev., 2005, 203, 98-109). There are four major causes for SCID: (i) the most frequent form of SCID, SCID-X1 (X-linked SCID or X-SCID), is caused by mutation in the IL2RG gene, resulting in the absence of mature T lymphocytes and NK cells. IL2RG encodes the gamma C protein (Noguchi, et al., Cell, 1993, 73, 147-157), a common component of at least five interleukin receptor complexes. These receptors activate several targets through the JAK3 kinase (Macchi et al., Nature, 1995, 377, 65-68), which inactivation results in the same syndrome as gamma C inactivation; (ii) mutation in the ADA gene results in a defect in purine metabolism that is lethal for lymphocyte precursors, which in turn results in the quasi absence of B, T and NK cells; (iii) V(D)J recombination is an essential step in the maturation of immunoglobulins and T lymphocytes receptors (TCRs). Mutations in Recombination Activating Gene 1 and 2 (RAGI and RAG2) and Artemis, three genes involved in this process, result in the absence of mature T and B lymphocytes; and (iv) Mutations in other genes such as CD45, involved in T cell specific signaling have also been reported, although they represent a minority of cases (Cavazzana-Calvo et al., Annu. Rev. Med., 2005, 56, 585-602; Fischer et al., Immunol. Rev., 2005, 203, 98-109). In aspect of the invention, relating to CRISPR or CRISPR-Cas complexes contemplates system, the invention contemplates that it may be used to correct ocular defects that arise from several genetic mutations further described in Genetic Diseases of the Eye, Second Edition, edited by Elias I. Traboulsi, Oxford University Press, 2012. Non-limiting examples of ocular defects to be corrected include macular degeneration (MD), retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Non-limiting examples of genes and proteins associated with ocular defects include but are not limited to the following proteins: (ABCA4) ATP-binding cassette, sub-family necrosis protein 5 (CQTNF5) C2 Complement component 2 (CCR2) Cluster of Differentiation 36 CFB Complement factor B CFH Complement factor CFH H CFHIR1 complement factor complement factor of chain fatty acids 4 ERCC6 excision repair cross-complementing present invention, with regard to CRISPR or CRISPR-Cas complexes contemplates also contemplates delivering to the heart. For the heart, a myocardium tropic adena-associated virus (AAVM) is preferred, in particular AAVM41 which showed preferential gene transfer in the heart (see, e.g., Lin-Yanga et al., PNAS, Mar. 10, 2009, vol. 106, no. 10). For example, US Patent Publication No. 20110023139, describes use of zinc finger nucleases to genetically modify cells, animals and proteins associated with cardiovascular disease.

The present invention will be further illustrated in the following Examples which are given for illustration purposes only and are not intended to limit the invention in any way.EXAMPLES Example 1: Material and Methods Cpf1 In Vivo DNA Constructs The AAV hSyn-HA-NLS-AsCpf1-spA vector was generated by PCR amplifying the AsCpf1 encoding sequence (ref) using 89), and cloning of the resulting PCR template into AAV backbone under the human Synapsin promoter (hSyn) using. For the generation of AAV pU6-sgRNA(SapI)-hSyn-GFP-KASH-hGH and pU6-3\u00d7gRNA-hSyn-GFP-KASH-hGH vectors, gene blocks encoding for pU6-DR(SapI) and pU6-3\u00d7gRNA, respectively, have been cloned into AAV hSyn-GFP-KASH-hGH backbones (unpublished). All constructs were verified by sequencing. For the generation of AAV sMecp2-HA-NLS-AsCpf1-spA-tRNAp-3\u00d7gRNA vector, gene blocks encoding for tRNA promoter (tRNAp) and 3\u00d7gRNA repeats were assembled with PCR amplified sMecp2-HA-NLS-AsCpf1 and ligated into AAV backbone. Production of AAV Vectors AAV1 particles in DMEM culture medium were produced as described previously (ref). Briefly, HEK293FT cells were transfected culture medium containing low titer AAV1 particles was collected after 48 h and sterile filtered. For high titer AAV1/2 production, HEK293FT cells were transfected with plasmids at equal ratios and pDF6 helper plasmid. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and high titer AAV1/2 virus was purified on heparin affinity column (ref). To generate high titer PHP.B viral vectors, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the following mix of plasmids using PEI: 5.7 g transgene plasmid, packaging plasmid, per 2.1\u00d7107 cells plated. 120 hours post-transfection, cells were harvested and cell lysates prepared by three cycles of freeze-thawing, combined with PEG-precipitated supernatant and treated with Benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) (50 U/ml cell lysate, 37\u00b0 C., 30 minutes). AAV was by iodixanol density-gradient ultracentrifugation (Optiprep density-gradient medium, Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway). Residual iodixanol was removed by replacing with PBS using a 100 kDa molecular weight cutoff centrifugation device (Amicon Ultra-15, Merck Millipore, Cork, Ireland) by three rounds of centrifugation at 1,500\u00d7g. After treatment of stocks with DNase I, the titer of AAV vectors was determined by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) using probe and primers specific for the mouse Mecp2 promoter sequence (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, Iowa). Primary Cortical Neuron Culture Mice used to obtain neurons for tissue cultures were sacrificed according to the protocol approved by the Broad's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Primary neurons were prepared from postnatal day P0.5 mouse brains (ref) and plated on poly-D-lysine (PDL) coated 24-well plates (BD Biosciences) or laminin/PDL coated Cultures grown at 37\u00b0 C. in Neurobasal A medium, supplemented B27, Technologies) and mix. For inhibition of glia cell proliferation, Cytosine-beta-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC, Sigma) at a final concentration of 10 M has been added to the culture medium after 48 h and replaced by fresh culture medium after 72 h. For AAV1 transduction, cultured neurons were infected with low titer AAV1 as described previously (Ref). One week after transduction, neurons have been harvested for isolating genomic DNA (QuickExtract DNA extraction buffer (Epicentre)) for immunofluorescent stainings. Injection of AAV1/2 into the Mouse Brain The Broad's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all animal procedures described here. Craniotomy was performed on adult (12-16 weeks) male C57BL/6N mice according to approved procedures, and 1 l of 1:1 AAV mixture (5.87\u00d71013 Vg/ml of single vector AAV-PHP.B in place for 3-5 minutes prior to retraction to prevent leakage. After injection, the incision was sutured and post-operative analgesics were administered according to approved IACUC protocol for three days following surgery. Systemic Delivery of AAV-PHP.B into Mouse AAV-PHP.B vectors were administered via the tail vein in a volume of 150 1 into 6-8-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice (Charles River). A dose of 1\u00d71012 vg/mouse was administered for single vector AAV-PHP.B sMecp2-HA-NLS-AsCpf1-spA-tRNAp-3\u00d7gRNA. A dose of 5\u00d71011 vg/mouse was administered for each of AAV-PHP.B dual vectors. Purification of Cell Nuclei from Intact Brain Tissue Cell nuclei from AAV1/2 injected hippocampal tissue were purified as described previously (Ref). Briefly, dissected tissue was homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer (HB) (320 mM Sucrose, CaCl, mM 0.1 0.1% NP40, 0.1 mM PMSF, 1 mM -mercaptoethanol) using 2 ml Type A and B Dounce homogenizer (Sigma). For gradient centrifugation, OptiPrep density gradient medium (Sigma) has been used. Samples were centrifuged at 10,100\u00d7g (7,500 rpm) for 30 min at 4\u00b0 C. (Beckman Coulter, SW28 rotor). Cell nuclei pellets were resuspended in 65 mM -glycerophosphate (pH 7.0), 2 mM MgCl2, 25 mM KCl, 340 mM sucrose and 5% glycerol. Finally, number and quality of purified nuclei was controlled using bright field microscopy. Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) of Cell Nuclei Purified cell nuclei were co-labeled with Vybrant\u00ae DyeCycle Ruby Stain (1:500, Life Technologies) and using a Beckman Coulter MoFlo Astrios EQ cell sorter (Broad Institute Flow Cytometry Core). Single and population (500 nuclei) GFP-KASH+ and GFP-KASH-nuclei were collected in 96 well plates containing 5 l of QuickExtract DNA extraction buffer (Epicentre) and spined down at 2,000\u00d7g for 2 min. Each 96 well plate included two empty wells as negative control. Genomic DNA Extraction and Indel Analysis DNA in QuickExtract DNA extraction buffer (Epicentre) was used for PCR amplification of targeted genomic loci. Following PCR assays (Transgenomics) of individual targets have been performed according to the manufacture's protocol. Band intensity quantification was performed as described before (ref). For next generation sequencing (NGS), PCR amplified targeted regions were attached with the Illumina PS adapters as well as unique sample-specific barcodes to the target amplicons. Barcoded and purified DNA samples were quantified by Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies) and pooled in an equimolar ratio. Sequencing libraries were then sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq Personal Sequencer (Life Technologies), with 300 bp reads length. The MiSeq reads for pooled and single nuclei were analyzed as described previously (ref). Western Blot Analysis AAV injected dentate gyrus tissues were lysed in 100 l of ice-cold RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling) containing 0.1% SDS and proteases inhibitors (Roche, Sigma) and sonicated in a Bioruptor sonicater (Diagenode) for 1 min. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.). Protein samples were separated under reducing conditions on 4-15% Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by Western blotting using primary antibodies: mouse anti-HA (Cell Signaling 1:500), mouse anti-GFP (Roche, 1:500), rabbit anti-Tubulin Signaling, after viral delivery, mice were transcardially perfused with PBS followed by PFA according to approved IACUC protocol. 30 m free floating sections (Leica, VT1000S) were boiled for 2 min in sodium citrate buffer (10 mM tri-sodium citrate dehydrate, 0.05% Tween20, pH 6.0) and cooled down at RT for 20 min. Sections were blocked with 4% normal goat serum (NGS) in TBST (137 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 0.2% Tween-20) for 1 hour. Primary antibodies were diluted in TBST with 4% NGS and sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. After 3 washes in TBST, samples were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT. After 3 times washing with TBST, sections were mounted using VECTASHIELD HardSet Mounting Medium LSM 710, (Millipore, 1:50-1:400); and secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) were used at 1:1000. Statistical Analysis All experiments were performed with a minimum of two independent biological replicates. Statistics were performed with Prism6 (GraphPad) using vector AsCpf1) scaffold) 3. U6p-sgRNA(SapI)-hSyn-GFP-KASH-hGH (dual vector scaffold) 4. (dual vector 3\u00d7sgRNA) 5. (single vector 3\u00d7sgRNA) Pre-crRNA Array Design and Cloning crRNAs were designed as four oligos (IDT) consisting of direct-repeats, each one followed by a crRNA (Table 2). The oligos favored a one-directional annealing through their sticky-end design. The oligonucleotides (final concentration 10 M) were annealed in 10\u00d7T4 ligase buffer (final concentration 1\u00d7; NEB) and T4 PNK (5 units; NEB). Thermocycler conditions were adjusted to 37 for 30 minutes, 95\u00b0 for 5 minutes followed by a 5\u00b0 C./minute ramp down to 25\u00b0. The annealed oligonucleotides were diluted 1:10 (final concentration 1 into BsmBI-cut pcDNA-huAsCpf1-U6, utilizing T7 DNA ligase (Enzymatics), in room temperature for 30 minutes. The constructs were transformed into STBL3 bacteria and plated on ampicillin-containing (100 g/ml) agar plates. Single colonies were grown in standard LB media (Broad Facilities) for 16 hours. Plasmid DNA was harvested from bacteria according to QIAquick Spin Miniprep protocol (QIAGEN). AsCpf1 efficiently cuts in primary neurons ( - - With reference to Table 3, each of the sequence elements are described according to the following: - - For the following sequence elements, further details may be found according to the following sources: for mMeCP2, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21476867. For tRNA-Pro, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26187160, for EFS, science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6166/84.full; for MVMI, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18059373 Our target variation analysis was performed using the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) dataset from 60,706 globally diverse individuals1. Our investigation of off-target candidates was performed using the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 dataset containing phased whole genome sequences from 2504 globally diverse individuals. Whole-Exome Target Variation Analysis We included all targets for CRISPR enzymes SpCas9-WT, SpCas9-VQR, SpCas9-VRER, SaCas9, and AsCpf1 in the human exome that map to protein coding regions of exons with an average coverage of at least 20 reads per ExAC sample. For analysis of variation in these targets, we included all missense or synonymous variants passing quality filtering in the ExAC dataset as described previously1. Because the publicly available ExAC dataset includes only summary information for each variant, it was not possible to determine if multiple variants occurring in a single genomic target occur on different haplotypes. Hence, we calculated target variation frequency as the maximum frequency of variants in an individual target. While accurately approximating the variation of most targets in the population, this approach does underestimate the variation frequency for rare targets containing multiple high frequency variants existing on separate haplotypes. Platinum targets were defined as those with a maximum variant frequency of less than 0.01% in the ExAC population. Off-Target Candidate Analysis Phased haplotypes included in the 1000 Genomes phase 3 dataset were used to create whole genome allele-specific references for 2504 individuals. We included in our analysis all single nucleotide polymorphisms passing quality filtering in the 1000 Genomes phase 3 dataset as described previously2. Up to 100 protein-coding platinum targets for SpCas9-VQR, SaCas9, and AsCpf1. Targets for each gene were searched against the references for each of the 2504 1000 genomes individuals to profile off-target candidates specific to each individual. For the purpose of this study, off-target candidates are defined as unintended genome-wide targets for a specific guide RNA-enzyme combination with less than or equal to 3-mismatches with the guide RNA protospacer. Applicants performed principle component analysis (PCA) taking into account all off-target candidates present in less than 100% of the 1000 Genomes individuals. A number of RNA-guided CRISPR nucleases have now been discovered and engineered as tools for genome editing, each with a different PAM (Cong, L. et al. Multiplex Genome Engineering Using CRISPR/Cas Systems. Science 339, 819-823 (2013); Mali, P. et al. RNA-Guided Human Genome Engineering via Cas9. Science 339, 823-826 (2013); Ran, F. A. et at. In vivo genome editing using Staphylococcus aureus Cas9. Nature 520, 186-191 (2015); Kleinstiver, B. P. et al. Engineered CRISPR-Cas9 altered PAM specificities. Nature 523, 481-485 (2015); B. et al. Cpf1 Is a Single RNA-Guided Endonuclease of a Class 2 CRISPR-Cas System. Cell 163, 759-771 (2015)) (Table 5). For therapeutic design, consideration of multiple enzymes with different PAM requirements is advantageous as it increases the number of available genomic targets for therapeutic loci. We therefore assessed variation at each PAM in the human exome for all of which are currently being considered as candidate enzymes for CRISPR therapeutic development (the recently reported eSpCas9 and SpCas9-HF have the same NGG PAM as SpCas9, and are thus not considered separately here (Slaymaker, I. M. et al. Rationally engineered Cas9 nucleases with improved specificity. Science 351, 84-88 (2016); Kleinstiver, B. P. et al. High-fidelity detectable genome-wide off-target effects. Nature 529, 490-495 (2016))). For each nuclease, we determined the fraction of exonic PAMs containing variants that alter PAM recognition. For the ExAC population, the total fraction of targets containing PAM-altering variants was similar for all enzymes (21-35%), except for SpCas9-VRER, which is impacted by PAM-altering variants in 80% of targets (Table 5, Considering full target variation for all ExAC individuals, we find that 93-95% of targets in the human exome for SpCas9, SpCas9-VQR, SaCas9, and AsCpf1 alter enzymatic activity ( The ExAC dataset is large enough that it provides near comprehensive coverage of variants in the protein coding genome occurring at allele frequencies of greater than or equal to 0.01% in the population (1 out of 10,000 alleles) (Lek et al. 2016, above). Hence, we used this dataset to compile a compendium of exome-wide target sites for SpCas9, Cas9-VQR, SaCas9, and AsCpf1 that do not contain variants occurring at >0.01% allele frequency (referred to as platinum targets; will be made available online) ( While it is preferable to design RNA guides specifically for individual patients this may be challenging from a regulatory standpoint and cost prohibitive. Selecting from these platinum targets during therapeutic design will maximize efficacy across patient populations with the smallest number of RNA guides. When targeting regions with more than one high frequency haplotypes, it will be necessary to design multiple RNA guides for each independent haplotype. We find that high variation targets or platinum targets cluster along exons for each of the 12 genes examined. For example, all targets in the 5 half of PCSK9 exon 4 are platinum, whereas very few platinum targets exist for exon 5 ( When designing RNA guides, in addition to minimizing target variation, it is necessary to ensure safety by minimizing potential off-target activity due to sites in the genome similar to the target. Unbiased investigation of genome-wide CRISPR nuclease activity suggests that most off-target activity occurs at loci with at most three mismatches to the RNA guide 12, 18, 19, 20, 8, 21, 22, 23. Current approaches for Cas9 target selection rank off-target candidates found in the reference human genome by both the number and position of RNA guide mismatches, with the assumption that loci containing less than 3 mismatches or containing PAM distal mismatches are more likely to be cleaved 12, 13, 14. However, in a population of individuals, this strategy is complicated by the existence of multiple haplotypes (sets of associated variants), which will contain different positions or numbers of mismatches at candidate off-target sites ( For individual RNA guides in these 12 genes, we find that the number of off-target candidates for SpCas9, SpCas9-VQR, SaCas9, and AsCpf1 varies from 0 to greater than 10,000 in the 1000 Genomes population ( Of the 12 genes we considered, some are more repetitive relative to the rest of the human genome, which impacts the specificity of the underlying RNA guides for each gene ( Because the 1000 Genomes project provides demographic information for each individual, we used this data to explore how much off-target candidate variation for a given individual is explained by population demographics. For all off-target candidates for RNA guides targeting the 12 genes considered here, we performed principle component analysis (PCA) and find that the first five principle components separate individuals very effectively by continent, sub-continent, and sex ( Here we determine the impact of population genetic variation on therapeutic genome editing with Streptococcus pyogenes (Sp) Cas9, and Acidaminococcus sp. (As) Cpf1,2,8,9,3. We find extensive variation likely to substantially alter the efficacy of these enzymes, and we show that unique, patient-specific off-target candidates will be the greatest challenge to safety. These results provide a framework for designing CRISPR-based therapeutics, highlight the need to develop multiple guide RNA-enzyme pairs for each target locus, and suggest that pre-therapeutic whole genome sequencing may be needed to ensure uniform efficacy and safety for treatment across patient populations.Example 4: Directed Evolution of Ascpf1 Pam Recognition Cpf1 is a class 2 type V CRISPR effector. It is a single RNA-guided endonuclease and cleaves DNA via staggered double-stranded break. editing is efficient. Cpf1 cuts distal to PAM: 18 and 23 bp downstream (Zetsche et al. (2015) Cell; 163: 759-771). Wild type AsCpf1 (such as AsCpf1 and LbCpf1) recognizes PAM sequence TTTV (wherein V is A, C, or G). Alternate PAM sequences will broaden the PAM repertoire, and hence the amount of possible target sequences. Moreover, shorther PAM sequences will likewise allow increase of the amount of possible target sequences. The human genome contains 41% GC, 59% AT Chances of 3 Ts in a row=0.0257 (2.57%). Approximately every 40 bases you will get a TTT. 0.00758 chance of 4 T in a row. So 1.81% chance of TTTV at any given starting location in genome. Approximately every 55 bases you will get TTTV. Via 961512548), PAM recognition was broadened. The PI (PAM interacting) and REC1 domains of Cpf1 are in close proximity to the PAM sequence when bound to DNA. Point mutations across the entire PAM proximal region were generated and evaluated for alternate PAM recognition. A mutant Cpf1 library was created, in which different Cpf1 mutants were encoded on a CamR plasmid capable of expression in E. coli (pACYS Cpf1 plasmid). The plasmids also contained a spacer sequence flanked by direct repeats, for reconstitution of a functional CPRISPR/Cpf1 complex, capable of binding to a DNA target locus. The library was transformed in E. coli to generate an E. coli containing Cpf1 mutant library. A second plasmid comprising a target sequence flanked by a PAM sequence, and further comprising an AmpR marker was trasformed in the mutant Cpf1 E. coli library. This was performed in parallel for a multitude of alternate PAM sequences. Library complexity was 32,256 (84 potitions*32codons*12PAMs) Selection on Cam/Amp media allowed identification of alternate PAM sequences which were recognized by a particular Cpf1 mutant. If a PAM sequence was recognized by a particular Cpf1 mutant, the AmpR containing plasmid was cut and Amp resistance was lost. Accordingly there was a specific depletion of members of the library that recognized the particular PAM sequence. Sequencing of the plasmids comprising the Cpf1 mutants and which were depleted in the screen identified particular Cpf1 mutants recognizing alternate PAM sequences. The above described approach was validated with wild type AsCpf1 ( The above described approach was then applied to the mutant AsCpf1 library. As a control, representation of the different Cpf1 mutants in a screen without PAM sequence demonstrated no significant over or underrepresentation of particular mutants, whereas representation of the different Cpf1 mutants in a screen with the PAM sequence that is recognized by the wild type Cpf1 demonstrated a significant underrepresentation (or depletion of wild type Cpf1). Representation of different Cpf1 mutants for various alternate PAM sequences is shown in It was observed that AsCpf1 mutant having the S542R mutation is capable of recognizing at least PAM sequence TCCC. Also, an AsCpf1 mutant having S542R is capable of recognizing at least PAM sequence TTCC.mutation. S542R allows for recognition of TCCC and TTCC (allows for C at 3rd position of PAM). AsCpf1 mutants having various the K548 mutations are capable of recognizing at least PAM sequence sequence TATC. AsCpf1 mutants having various the K548 mutations are capable of recognizing at least PAM sequence sequence TGTC. K548 provides thymine stringency for 2nd base of PAM. Many alternate aa allow for recognition of TATC or TGTC PAMs. Further AsCpf1 mutants (data not shown) were identified which recognized additional alternate PAM sequences: 167A (recognizes NTTV or TTV), 604A (recognizes TTTV), 607A (recognizes TCCC). An in vitro cleavage experiment was performed (essentially as described in Zetsche et al. (2015), Cell 163:1-13), in which lysate from mammalian cells expressing AsCpf1 was incubated in a test tube with a plasmid library containing a eight-bp randomized PAM preceding the target site. The members of the PAM library containing targetable PAMs was cut, while all other PAMs were left intact. The uncut PAMs were sequenced and compared to the negative control. PAMs depleted relative to the control represented those that Cpf1 can cleave\u2014the sequence logo for the collective set of depleted PAM sequences is shown in Based on structural considerations of the Cpf1 protein and its interaction with gRNA and target sequence, the following amino acid residues of AsCpf1 (Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6) were found in physical proximity of the PAM sequence (i.e. within 1.4 nm of one or more of these residues are expected to affect PAM recognition. The following amino acid residues were selected for mutagenesis, and hence resulted in mutated Cpf1 proteins having the indicated amino PAM sequences were screened in a bacterial PAM screen with 11 below indicates PAM sequences found to be associated with the indicated mutants (AsCpf1), as identified in a bacterial PAM screen (middle column), from which a putative PAM is postulated (right column). At least the indicated PAM sequences are recognized by the indicated mutants. Indicated in bold are mutants which have been generated and tested. PAM sequences of other mutants are postulated based on structural considerations as well as knowledge of the PAM sequence for the generated mutants. To assess global PAM preferences, compared to wild type by an in vitro PAM identification assay. Cell lysate from HEK293 cells expressing AsCpf1 (or a variant) was incubated with in vitro-transcribed crRNA and a library of plasmid DNA containing a constant target preceded by a degenerate sequence (5-NNNNNNNN-target). For each Cpf1 variant, ten replicates of the cleavage reaction were carried out, each incubated for a different amount of time, in order to determine cleavage kinetics. WT AsCpf1 was most Guides plages with plasmids and 100 ng U6::crRNA PCR fragments per well. Guides targeting DNMT1-3 or DNMT1-4 were used, between 24 nt (full length) and 14 nt in length, truncated from the 3 end. Guides of 24 nt to 19 nt length demonstrated similar activity with both enzymes. Activity was somewhat reduced using 18 nt guides and further reduced using guides of 17 nt to 15 nt. Little or no activity was observed using guides of fewer than 15 nt. ( HEK293FT cells were transfected in 24-well plages with plasmids ans 100 ng U6::crRNA PCR fragments per well. Guides targeting DNMT1-3 or DNMT1-4 were used, all 24 nt in length. The number of matching nucleotides was varied from 24 nt (full length) to 14 nt, with matching nucleotides closest to the PAM, and non-matching nucleotides at the 3 end. Guides matching 24 nt to 19 nt demonstrated similar activity with both enzymes. Activity was somewhat reduced using guides matching 18 nt. Guides matching 17 nt to 15 nt showed little or no detectable activity. Activity was not detectable for guides matching fewer that 15 nt. ( Different Cpf1 mutants (Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6, essentially as described in Zetsche et al. (2015), Cell, 163:759-771) were cloned in eukaryotic expression vectors (as an example, the expression vectors used for evauating AsCpf1 having S542/K607R mutations is provided in Target sequences corresponding to the indicated target sequence numbers in % indel activity in HEK cells was evaluated for target sequences (a guide RNA target site was selected within the DNMT1 gene) associated with a variety of PAM sequences, as indicated in The RR and RVR variants were compared at their preferred PAMs in BEK293 cells ( YCN PAM sequence for the AsCpf1 S542R/K607R mutant as indicated in The different target sequences and target genes of Genome-wide editing specificity of the RR and RVR variants was evaluated using BLISS (double-strand breaks labeling in situ and sequencing), which quantifies DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) across the genome. To compare the variants to WT, analysis was restricted to target sites bearing PAMs that can be reliably cleaved by all three enzymes; TTTV was the only PAM that met this criterion, although it has lower activity for the RR variant. For three of the four target sites evaluated (VEGFA, GRIN2B, and DNMT1), no off-target activity was detected from deep sequencing of any of the BLISS-identified loci ( Whether specificity can be improved by removing non-specific contacts, e.g. between positively-charged or polar residues and the target DNA, was tested. K949A, which is located in the cleft of the protein that is hypothesized to interact with the non-target DNA strand, was tested in combination with the RR and RVR variants, K949A reduced cleavage at all off-target sites assessed while maintaining high levels of on-target activity ( Because Cpf1-family enzymes have strong sequence and structural homology, the S542, K548, N552, and K607 unambiguous correspondences in other Cpf1 orthologs. On the basis of crystal structure, LbCpf1 can similarly be engineered to recognize TYCV/CCCC and TATV PAMs, e.g., by the mutations G532R/K595R and represented by SEQ ID NOs: 261-358) Cpf1 proteins codon optimized for human expression were synthesized with an N-terminal nuclear localization tag and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 CMV expression plasmid by Genscript.

Genomic DNA was harvested using QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution (Epicentre). Deep sequencing to characterize Cpf1 indel patterns in 293FT cells HEK293FT cells were transfected and harvested as described for assessing activity of Cpf1 cleavage. The genomic region flanking DNMT1 targets were amplified a two-round PCR region to add Illumina P5 adapters as unique sample-specific barcodes to amplicons. PCR products E-gel (Invitrogen) and using QiaQuick Spin Column (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Samples were pooled and quantified by Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies). The prepared cDNA libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq (Illumina). Indels were mapped using a implementation of the Geneious 6.0.3 Read Mapper.Example 8: Examplary Lipid Particles A lipid particle of the invention can be prepared as follows.

In a typical experiment, the AAV concentration is 109 AAV/g lipid nanoparticle. After mixing, the mixture is left at room temperature for 15 min. Before imaging, the sample is mixed using vortex for 1 min. In one embodiment, an AAV composition, comprising AAV capsids or capsid subunit proteins is introduced into the resulting mixture and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. (The AAV capsids and capsid subunit proteins can be wild type capsid subunits or further contain hybrid AAV capsid subunits comprising heterologous proteins or peptides.) The weight ratio between the lipid-like compound and AVV component is varied, for example 5:1, 10:1, 20:1, or 50:1. The complex composition thus prepared is ready for use in cells.Example 9: Hybrid AAV-Lipid Particle Hybrid AAV-lipid particles were formulated by mixing AAV8 vector with lipid nanoparticles encasing purified negatively supercharged CRE recombinase protein (10 AAV virions per g lipid). The hybrid AAV-lipid particles were used to infect HEK293T cells. Protein delivery of CRE by the hybrid AAV-lipid particle was compared to lipid-CRE formulation 48 hours post transfection using a DsRed reporter for CRE activity. ( Diameter of the AAV/lipid nanocomplexes in diameter can be determined by imaging the complexes using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). See HEK293T cells were transfected with three constructs. One provides a luciferase (Cluc) mRNA target that has a UAG motif at a defined position ( Cells were harvested using the cells to CT protocol (Joung et al., Nat Protoc. 2017). cDNA was amplified by PCR and sequences by NGS. Three to six technical replicates where performed for each ADAR fusion construct and guide/target combination. AsCpf1 with C-terminal ADAR fusions performed the best with up to 30% A to G conversion at nucleotide position 18 (target/guide #2), counted from were the PAM would be on a DNA target ( SpCas9 ADAR fusion did not result in A to G conversion above the background observed with the ADAR only control ( In certain of the following, Cpf1 amino acids are followed by nuclear localization signals (NLS) (italics), a orthologs include: The invention is further described in the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the invention described in the claims.
