It is safe to say that I had just given up since no one had any answers for me and would simply recommend that I go on a different antibiotic every time. (BTW I had a FUNGAL INFECTION which only worsens on antibiotics- such a waste of time and money). But, Doctor Joy knew right away what I had and was able to test which remedies would work best for my body. She is highly trained in the classic principles of Chinese Medicine and has methods to ENSURE that the remedies she picks are the right match for everyone. She not only gives you the tools that you need to turn your health around, but she educates you on how to maintain healthy habits that create lasting results that you can feel!! She is a very experienced and knowledgable doctor, therapist, and FRIEND all in one. It is clear that she genuinely cares about the well-being of the people that she cares for and even for the ones not directly under her care. Dr. Joy turned my life around and gave me the power of my health back. I could never begin to thank her enough for helping me. I look forward to working with her for many more years to come.

Yes, the initial consultation and supplements can be pricey however, the subsequent visits are much lower. She is not only addressing my pain issue, she is addressing my whole body. You cannot take the supplements alone; she also teaches you the importance of diet and exercise.Lisa Miyamoto12/26/2017 - FacebookI started seeing Dr. Ostroff a little over a month ago for eczema.

I started experiencing symptoms in July and they progressively got worse. It spread from my neck to my feet and was so uncomfortable that I would wake up during the night because the itching had become painful. I did try a dermatologist and was able to get temporary relief with the use of steroid creams, a round of oral steroids and eventually a steroid injection. But the relief was only temporary and the eczema and discomfort never really went away. I also had concerns that the steroids were only treating the symptoms and not the cause of the eczema and did not want to be on steroids long term. Desperate, I made an appointment with Dr. Ostroff at the recommendation of a friend who had been seeing her and was very happy with her results. Within a week of my appointment with Dr. Ostroff my symptoms improved to the point that I could get a full nights rest. The condition of my skin has greatly improved and is almost completely healed. Even the scaring from some of the more severe patches have gone away. In addition to treating the eczema I've lost a much needed 10lbs. It wasn't a part of my initial goals but the weight loss has helped me to feel better overall. Prior to seeing Dr. Ostroff I also had frequent stomach aches, low energy and sudden drops in blood sugar which would leave me dizzy and nauseated. Since seeing Dr. Ostroff my energy level has improved, my stomach pains have gone away and I haven't experienced any dizziness or nausea. I also have an overall better outlook about my health, taking care of my body and making better choices for me and my family. Cost is definitely a factor and Dr. Ostroff's services are not cheap. However, I feel that the money I've invested into my health has been worth it. I also feel the Dr. Ostroff is more than willing to work with you in terms of your financial situation. Every visit that I have gone to the staff has been very friendly and professional. Her facilities are clean and the environment is very welcoming. If you are looking for long term improved health and are willing to commit to a healthier lifestyle than Dr. Ostroff is an excellent person to partner with. read less - Rovelma Hudson12/04/2017 - GoogleDr. Joy is very direct with her evaluation and treatment plans.

My candida is getting much better. My acne is getting better. I no longer have horrible cystic acne. Before Dr. Ostroff, I had zero energy. Now I can get out of bed in the morning and I feel rested. I have energy all day, and even when I get home in the evening! I get home from work and have energy to cook dinner, do homework (I went back to school online), visit with my son, clean my house, etc. I have always needed a lot of sleep, but still felt tired even if I slept 8-10 hours, and I wish I had gone to see Dr. Ostroff years ago. I had never had acupuncture before Dr. Ostroff, so I was a bit nervous, but she is a pro. I am glad she's applied acupuncture thousands of times before me...I don't even feel the needles go in! I knock out and feel even more amazing afterwards. Her spine and neck adjustments are gentle and you can tell she's a pro.

Within the first week, even though the powder tasted like tar, it made me feel good. Not the I won a million bucks good, but the I totally just scored the highest score on an online game good-which is still totes for the awesome. None the less, I would totes recommend you seeing her, don't be shy about telling her what your goals are; or what's bugging you; and be open minded. If you're already reading my review than you know you need the help and why bother resisting it right?

She will get you better, you just need to do what she says. If you've been sick for 5, 10, 20 years or longer, why are you still allowing MD's to make you sicker? Don't you want to get better? I also recommend Dr. Ostroff if you have an autistic child or a child who suffers from asthma, ADHD, etc. She will safely detox your child from heavy metals and other toxins that affect the neurotransmitters in the brain and the candida that has destroyed their gut-brain health.

A combination of 21st century pure naturopathic medications, traditional Chinese medicinal tonics, acupuncture, massage and a digital apparatus to test various compounds and tonics individualized for each patient. There is no one size fits all approach here. Treatment modalities are reviewed and changed at each appointment depending on your progress and the need for additional or different products. Dr. Ostroff is very intuitive and actually listens to you. I found this refreshing and very helpful in the progress of my \"rehabilitation\" to a healthy state of being. Do not expect that you will feel totally well in a few weeks. It took years for me to arrive at an unhealthy place. I was amazed at the rapid progress toward health that I have made. I am a retired dentist and found out things about posture and eating habits that will serve me well for the rest of my life. Your health is a life long endeavor. In a short period of time I was able to feel more than 10 years younger with increased mental focus and no \"age pains\" that I initially presented with at my first appointment.

I still have a way to go, but going from feeling like a grandma and only being 28 to feeling like I am 18 has been a great change in life. 5 stars can never truly express the gratitude I have for the change Dr. Ostroff has done to my life. She gets 10 stars from me. read lessArlene Estrella7/18/2014 - GoogleDr. Joy is amazing! I have been through many types of alternative medicine but Dr. Joy truly addresses the WHOLE body.

Over the past two years I have had a short attention span, lots of anxiety and low energy. I just thought it was my personality. After some herbal supplements, acupuncture and diet alterations I feel amazing! It's very refreshing to feel so energized, balanced and motivated. I've gotten more work done this month than I have the past three months! I sleep soundly and comfortably and anxiety is at a minimum. The office is very clean, the staff is warm and welcoming and have always been happy to accommodate my schedule. As for Dr. Joy, she is a glowing, empathetic, professional and nurturing person who radiates health and positive energy. She truly wants to help you feel your best.

Over the 3 months, Dr. Ostroff put me on a regiment of a number of supplements. No, we did not do a blood test. Over my three months my conditions improved dramatically. However, it is also important to note that I also kept on my western medical regiment as well. The timing of my improvement is correlated quite strongly with the timing of Dr Ostroff's help. My health has improved and my neurologists is quite impressed with my recovery. I have read the reviews for Dr. Ostroff and I can understand why some would be reluctant and disproving of Naturopathic and Holistic medicine, or of Dr Ostroff for that matter. I find it important with Dr Ostroff to ask her questions about everything she is doing and giving me so that I understand thoroughly. Her style is so that the patients needs to prompt her with more questions in order to get more information out of her. She is willing to answer your questions. And yes, the supplements do get expensive. Unfortunately my insurance doesn't cover pro active medicine Its a process and you can't expect overnight results. Holistic medicine is just as powerful as you want it to be. Its important to delve into it with a positive mindset... after doing your homework to decide if it's right for you. read less - mariaus12/20/2012 - YellowPagesToday I am well and I feel fan...

In less than two months, my hot flashes are much milder and less frequent, to the point where I can finally function during the day. The dizziness is gone and I can drive and go out with confidence. My sleep has improved. I feel so much better and believe that I have only just begun. My experience with Dr. Ostroff has been life changing, and I am now looking forward to the rest of my life knowing that the best is yet to come. read less Services Include: Whole Body Vibration Follow our Health Blog September 11, 2023 [Naturopathy vs Functional Medicine: What Are the Differences and Similarities?](https://www.naturalhealinghawaii.com/blog/naturopathy-vs-functional-medicine/) [Naturopathic Nutrition and Naturopathic Nutrition Therapies](https://www.naturalhealinghawaii.com/blog/naturopathic-nutrition/) [What to Wear to Acupuncture](https://www.naturalhealinghawaii.com/blog/what-to-wear-to-acupuncture/) [Homeopathic Remedy for Sore Throat](https://www.naturalhealinghawaii.com/blog/homeopathic-remedy-sore-throat/) [The Principles of Naturopathic Medicine & Naturopathy](https://www.naturalhealinghawaii.com/blog/principles-naturopathic-medicine/) [Your Skin Is a Reflection of What Is Within](https://www.naturalhealinghawaii.com/blog/skin-reflection-within/) [The Naturopathic Approach to Treating Acne](https://www.naturalhealinghawaii.com/blog/naturopathic-approach-treating-acne/) [Naturopathy vs Functional Medicine: What Are the Differences and Similarities?](https://www.naturalhealinghawaii.com/blog/naturopathy-vs-functional-medicine/) Sep 6, 2023 In today's healthcare landscape, patients and practitioners alike are seeking medical approaches and treatments that address the root causes of illness and offer comprehensive, personalized solutions.
