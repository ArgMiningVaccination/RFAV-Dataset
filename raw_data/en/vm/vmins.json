If people pay attention to the five flavors and mix them well, their bones will remain straight, their muscles will remain tender and young, their b reath will circulate fr e e l y, their pores will be fine in texture, and conse- q u e n t l y , their breath and bones will be filled with the essence of life. \u00d1The Yellow Emperor\u00d5s Classic of Internal Medicine The world for eating in Chinese is comprised of two characters chi and fan, which means \u00d2eat rice.\u00d3 The w o r d for taking medicine is chi yao , or \u00d2 e at medi- cine.\u00d3 The ancient culinary traditions of China cr e- ated meals for pleasure as well as for healing. Food p rovides taste, texture, delight, energy, and nourishment. In China, food also is a source of medicinal healing compounds tha t support well -being and health. On a recent trip to China, I real - ized that the average Chinese person knew more about the medi - cinal pr o p e r ties of food than I did after years of r e s e a rc h . Medicinal foods are part of their everyday diet. I was humbled and awed on that trip to Asia, where I lec- t u red on prevention, wellness, health, nutrition, and the new field of n u t r i g e n o m i c s \u00d1the science of how molecules in food interact with our genes to support or interfere with our health. I learned more from the broad knowledge of the Chinese people and the matter-of-fact discussions of the healing properties of the food that I shared with my hosts than I did from my hours of re s e a r ching current medical journals. A top executive of the Asian branch of Merrill Lynch and his wife took me to dinner a t a fine Chinese restaurant. Each dish delighted my palate and sa t- isfied my stomach, and with each bite I was aware that I was ea t- ing medicine. Modern scientists are rapidly discovering new molecules in food that have medicinal pr o p e r ties and enhance health through impr oving the function of genes and metabolism. The ancient Chinese have incorpor ated this knowledge into their cuisine for thousands of years. There is no distinction between food and medicine in Asia. People there eat their medicine. In America, where I work and teach, I spend most of my e f f o r ts educating people that food i smedicine. I encourage my patients to eat their medicine and heal through food. The notion t h at food provides anything other than calories for energy and sustaining life is foreign to most Westerners. Food contains infor - m a t i o n t h at speaks to our genes. In Asia, I was speaking to thec o n v e r ted, simply illuminating with science what they apply e v e r y day and have for thousands of years. Dinner in Asia is a date with the doctor. In this issue of Al t e r n a t i v e Therapies in Health and Medicine , a scientific r e v i e w of the effects of glucomannan\u00d1a soluble fiber derived from the Asian pota t o -like tuber Amorphophallus konjac \u00d1 and obesity establishes the value of traditional foods as medicine. Long used to make k o n n y a k u , a jelly pr e p a r ed in Japan for more than 1,500 years, the medicinal pr o p e r ties and multiple benefits of konjac fiber or glucomannan were appr e c i ated as early as the 6th c e n t u r y. Konjac is much more viscous than usual fibers, r e t a i n i n g up to 17 times its weight in wa t e r. Expanding in the stomach and the small and large intestines, it absorbs fat, accelerates elimina- tion, reduces cholesterol, blunts sugar absorption, and facilita t e s weight loss, in part by increasing feelings of sa t i e t y . Dinner with my hosts was full of wonderfully pr e s e n t e d , delicious, and sometimes mysterious ingredients. Some of the i n g r edients were unusual, such as the mild, crunchy white tr e e fungus, bai mu er , which enhances deto x i f i c a tion and impro v e s the complexion. The mixed vegetable dish that also included sweet, o val, nutty, powerful antioxidant ginkgo nuts, which are a p ow e r ful antioxidant, was pr e p a r ed to help increase cir c u l at i o n and improve cognitive function. The earthy s h i t a k e or Chinese black mushrooms that were served boost immunity, and the crisp, deep green gai lan or Chinese broccoli contains glucosino - l ates that promote deto x i f i c a tion and prevent cancer. It is also rich in minerals, such as calcium and magnesium, folic acid and many other vitamins and antioxidants. At the beginning of the meal, I was treated to shark fin soup, a delicacy from the cartilage of a shar k\u00d5s fin that is known to help arthritis and may fight can - cer. The deep red crispy Peking duck skin is colored with Chinese red rice yeast, known to contain a statin-like substance that lo w- ers cholesterol. A mellow fish maw and ginseng soup incr e a s e s energy, helps us adapt to stress, and pr ovides easily digested pr o- tein and omega 3 fatty acids. The chicken with ginger and bitter melon that we ate is believed to reduce inflammation and help detoxification and blood sugar balance. Even desert was healing. A warm, barely sweet longhan soup with lotus seeds and quail eggs was soothing and nourishing. L o n g h a n i m p r oves blood pr e s s u r e and anemia; lotus seeds enhance male sexual function, alleviate diarrhea, and calms, reducing palpitations; and quail eggs are an easily digestible source of protein, folate, and choline and they reduce the overallE ATING MEDICINE: FOOD AS PHARMA C O L O G Y Mark A.
