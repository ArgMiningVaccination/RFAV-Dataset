Vance Dietz, MD, [explains](http://www.anthromed.org/Article.aspx?artpk=764) at AnthroMedLibrary: Anthroposophic medicine sees humans as passing through successive earthly lives incarnated in a physical body, \"laying one's karmic foundation in one incarnation for the next.\" Illness comes to an individual not by chance but as an opportunity to come to terms with one's karma from previous incarnations. Illness provides an individual with a message which ultimately assists in self-growth and development. The responsibility of a healer is to assist the human being experiencing the illness to deal with it karmically. Thus, prevention of an illness may be beneficial in the course of one incarnation but may not be for the entire soul life and development of the person. Anthroposophy views that in early childhood years, soul-spiritual forces permeate the organism and have an organizing effect involving growth. [...] [T]hese childhood illnesses are viewed by anthroposophic medicine as a necessary instrument in dealing with karma and [...] the incarnation of the child. During childhood illnesses, anthroposophic medical practitioners administer medical remedies to assist the child in dealing with the illness not only as a disease affecting their physical body in the physical plane, but also for soul spiritual development, thereby promoting healing. In contrast, allopathic medicaments are aimed at suppression of symptoms and not necessarily the promotion of healing. [...] Anthroposophic medicine teaches that to prevent a disease in the physical body only postpones what will then be produced in another incarnation. Serious complications are karmically [meant](https://zooey.wordpress.com/2009/10/22/repost-vaccination/) to occur. Another anthroposophical MD [writes](http://www.anthromed.org/Article.aspx?artpk=759): Each child gets ill in his or her own individual way, and each illness a child gets has a meaningful part to play among the challenges belonging to that child's life. A third one [says](http://www.anthromed.org/Article.aspx?artpk=756) that: Children's illnesses modify the body and make it more akin to the individuality inhabiting it. There is now greater compatibility between the outer person (body) and the inner person (soul/spirit). The child becomes more stable, more enclosed. The fire/fever process sweeps away inherent weaknesses, chronic colds, bed wetting, psychic problems - even, mother can attest to this. Thus, it's not that anthroposophical medical practitioners don't know about the risks of disease, or that they're consciously evil \u2014 they believe that this spiritual stuff is more important than avoiding suffering or death, and, from their viewpoint, they're doing good and they're helping the child avoiding more detrimental consequences (in the \u2014 very \u2014 long run). It shouldn't be a part of any medical practice, because the aims are obviously spiritual. There are several other articles on ['child health'](http://www.anthromed.org/Issue.aspx?isspk=83) on the library's website. I can but recommend them.
