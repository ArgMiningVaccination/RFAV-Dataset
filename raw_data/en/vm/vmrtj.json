Taditional Five Element Acupuncture can help yours. When the immune system is functioning properly the body should not experience illness. The immune system viewed through Traditional Five Element Acupuncture consists of two parts, one being the external system and the second being the internal system. The external aspect of the immune system involves the body's natural ability to ward off external disease factors that can cause illnesses, such as colds, flu, allergies and sinus problems. Wei Qi In Traditional Five Element Acupuncture system, the external immune system is a superficial defence energy called Wei Qi. Wei Qi is like a shield that surrounds the body, located in the layers of the muscle and skin. This energy controls the opening and the closing of the pores. Protective Energy Wei Qi is nourished by the air that we breathe and the foods that we eat. Air quality and diet can directly affect our protective energy. The circulation and activation of Wei Qi is propelled by the energy of the Lungs. Poor Lung energy can lead to a poor defence against external pathogens (disease) and environmental factors such as wind, cold, heat, dampness, or dryness. Since Wei Qi is controlled by the Lungs which is part of the respiratory system, the nasal passage, throat, mucous membranes, and sinuses are commonly affected by an external invasion of pathogens. The Common Cold Environmental factors can contribute to the cause of illness. When the body's Wei Qi is weak, wind can invade the body. Wind is the primary transporter for most external invasions. The wind can transport other pathogens, such as those found in cold, hot, damp or dry weather often causing the common cold. Typically, wind affects the head and the neck. Protecting the Neck Typically, wind invasion affects the head and the neck. Common symptoms felt from a wind invasion may include sore neck, tightness in the shoulders, a runny nose with a clear discharge, a headache, and a general overall weakness of the body. This process often leads to achiness in the neck and upper back. So remember to wear your scarf! Interior Invasion Exterior conditions are usually have a shorter duration then internal conditions. If the external pathogen is not expelled from the body the illness may move deeper into the body. As a cold condition moves toward the interior, the cold condition begins to turn into a warm condition, and the body may respond with alternating chills and fever. Weakened Immunity When a disease becomes an interior condition it can have a greater impact, affecting the body's interior energy and the interior immune system. If a person's immunity is really weak, external pathogens can go straight into an interior condition affecting the body at a deeper level right away. Lungs Ultimately, having weak Wei Qi can lead to an increased susceptibility to illness. Even if we have healthy Lungs physically, energetically the Lungs are taxed on a daily basis by the pollutants of our environment as well as being affected by emotions such as worry, grief and sadness. Acupuncture to Strengthen your Wei Qi Traditional Five Element Acupuncture is commonly used to boost the immune system and strengthen the Wei Qi your protective energy. If you are susceptible to colds, allergies, sinus problems or other respiratory problems, Acupuncture may be a very good choice for you. Acupuncture is effective in treating both acute and/or chronic conditions and also good as a preventative. Acupuncture is a great way to strengthen your primary defence against illness.
