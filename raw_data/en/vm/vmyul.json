Nutrafol's proprietary blend of 21 powerful ingredients is perfect for women who are ready to feel good again by improving their hair's thickness and strength. The best part? It takes the same approach to medicine as we do at the Young Naturopathic Center for Wellness. Unlike other hair restoration products, Nutrafol's Women's Balance targets underlying factors that cause thinning, like stress, nutrition and environment, with medical-grade, natural ingredients. The award-winning formula supports fuller, stronger hair for women before, during and beyond menopause. Many people in today's world live high-stress lifestyles and aren't always able to get every mineral and nutrient their body needs. With a daily Women's Balance supplement, you get a blend of essentials to meet those hair growth needs. And check this out: a clinical study found that within six months of treatment, 86% of women saw improved hair growth and 84% found thicker, more robust and softer hair. How about that for reliable results? For Men Regulating hormones is a tricky process. When it comes to hair growth treatments, men often trade fuller hair for a drop in testosterone levels and, subsequently, their sexual performance. It's a rough compromise, sacrificing one component of your life to improve another, but we are happy to tell you that it isn't one you have to make anymore! Nutrafol for Men can provide you with medical-grade, natural ingredients that will boost your hair growth without negatively impacting any other part of your health. In a 2017 clinical study, zero adverse effects were reported, but several positive effects like better sleep, sex drive, energy and mood were also observed. So, if you find yourself longing for a non-harmful hair restoration solution, Nutrafol for Men is pretty much the no-brainer option. And once you've invested in your hair, why not tackle the other issues that happen when your hormones drop? We have helped thousands of men and women to diagnose and treat hormonal issues. Hair Serum If you are looking to give your hair growth regimen a bit of a boost, Nutrafol's Hair Growth Serum is a safe, natural and effective way to support the restoration of thick and strong hair. Extracts from ingredients like green tea leaf, pea sprout, turmeric, sea buckthorn, neptune kelp and tea tree leaf all come together to create an awesome product. This all-natural product works best when applied twice a day and as part of an overall hair restoration regimen that includes Nutrafol's medical-grade supplements. V-Fit Plus Many women begin to notice changes in their vaginal health as they age. It's an intimate aspect of your wellness and having a medical-grade solution in the comfort of your own home is a game-changer! The V-Fit Plus is a device that uses a mixture of LED red light, thermal and sonic technology that can be totally customized to your unique needs. You'll notice drastic improvements to hydration and the sensitivity of your vagina after treatment that will make you feel confident about being intimate once again. Patients often come back and rave to us about how much more enjoyable sex has become, for both parties. We hear things like, \"I feel like I'm 30 years old 'down there' now!\" and \"My husband and I used to barely ever have sex. Now we have sex almost too much! Keyword: Almost.\" The V-Fit Plus is only purchasable through licensed medical facilities like the Young Naturopathic Center for Wellness, where professionals can help guide you through the treatment process. Using the device is easy and intuitive, and you only need to dedicate about 12 minutes every other day to find results. Like any exercise routine, you'll probably need to build yourself up to 12-minute sessions, but once you do, you'll be well on your way to greatly improved vaginal and sexual health. ProLon The journey of transformation has a lot of different parts to it. One of the most significant parts is making the change to a healthy diet. Whether you are looking to kickstart healthy eating habits or shed a few extra pounds, we recommend the ProLon Fast Mimicking Diet to bring about those changes. ProLon leans into the vast number of benefits of intermittent fasting without the need to actually fast. Yep, you read that right. This five-day, plant-based meal program triggers your body into thinking it's on a fast without having to actually go without food. If you've ever thought to yourself, \"what I would give to be able to eat whatever I want and still be healthy and fit,\" you might find that this program is exactly what you were looking for. But it isn't just about losing weight. The program also triggers an effect known as autophagy, the process of cleaning up old and worn-out cells. You can think of this as a kind of a \"spring cleaning\" effect where your body starts a cellular rejuvenation process to clean up and recycle damaged cells, maintain metabolic balance, and enhance focus, clarity and energy. It even tastes great! ProLon is recommended once a month for three consecutive months to obtain optimal results. And if you are having a tough time with your health, a little spring cleaning could probably do you some good!
