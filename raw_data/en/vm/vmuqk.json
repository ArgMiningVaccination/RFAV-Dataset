I first ask my client's to fill out a client/patient intake form, so I can better understand the reason for there visit. I then spend a minimum of 30 to 45 minutes getting to know them and the challenges they are facing. After the initial consultation, I proceed with the type of session they have booked. I don't believe in rushing a client, by putting a client straight into a session, without first understanding who they are, why they've sought my service and what challenges their facing. So I make a point to get to know my clients first. I believe creating a heart based connection is very important! So I make it my goal to listen and understand my clients, before we get started. - What education and/or training do you have that relates to your work? I'm a certified Reiki Grand Master Practitioner and Instructor. My original Training was done In New Delhi India, after which I was lead to Japan in search of the more authentic teachings and practice of Reiki. I then trained at the Reiki Institute in Kyoto Japan. During my retreat's to India and Japan, I was lucky enough to receive formal training in ancient traditional homeopathic and herbal remedies also. After returning to the west I pursued a health coaching certification through Integrative Therapeutics and the Health and Science Institute. I went on to attend Western style Reiki training with a few different western trained Reiki master's, in order to understand the different nuances of the western-style taught here in the states. I'm also a Certified Life coach. Reiki is a way of life for me. It teaches a path to a chaos free, peaceful and balanced life. Adding life coaching to my practice, seemed an obvious step to help my clients find a path to an inspired, balanced, organized, motivated, healthy life. I continually take new classes and certifications to stay updated in the holistic practices of energy work and natural health practices. My passion is researching all forms of health, wellness, and energy healing methods. The truly Original Ancient Japanese Art of Reiki Healing, is definitely my first Love!! I like to study the Science and the spiritual side of healing. I feel that all the latest Scientific findings, now back up the spiritual side of things. Up until now, society has depended on faith to understand. Now, we are coming around to the black and white science of understanding how energy and healing, really work through the mind body connection. I like to stay well grounded, up to date and educated in my field. In this way, I can continually provide the optimum environment with proper counsel and training, to help my students and patients thrive. "}
