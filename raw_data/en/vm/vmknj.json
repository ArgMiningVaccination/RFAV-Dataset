According to the WHO, approximately 80% of theworld population still relies on herbal medicines for health-relatedbenefits. Hence, it is not surprising that botanicals are available inthe form of different types of products, including HMPs, PFSs,homeopathic products, foods (teas and juices), and cosmetics. Whereas up to 20 years ago herbal medicines in the EU were mainly authorized on the basis of their WEU and submitted evi-dence for preclinical safety, clinical trials results, and extensive quality control, herbal preparations today are mostly available as PFSs with no guaranteed efficacy and much less controlled quality[1, 2]. This shift is mainly attributed to the large expenses and thelong duration associated with the registration of HMPs in thehighly regulated pharmaceutical market. While the authorizationand registration of new HMPs steadily declined over the last de-cades, the global herbal supplements and remedies market exhib-ited a robust growth and is expected to reach $107 billion by 2017 according to the Global Industry Analysts Report [3]. The factors that fueled this growth include an increasing awareness aboutAuthor Mona Abdel-Tawab Affiliation Central Laboratory of German Pharmacists, Eschborn,Germany Key words plant food supplements, botanical dietary supplements, herbal products, quality, safety, efficacy received August 25, 2017 revised November 14, 2017 accepted November 20, 2017 Bibliography DOI https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0043-123764 Published online ISSN 0032 0943 Correspondence Prof. Dr. Mona Abdel-Tawab Central Laboratory German Pharmacists Carl-Mannich-Str. 20, Germany Phone: + 496196937955, Fax: + 496196937810tawab@em.uni-frankfurt.deABSTRACT Given the expanding market of plant food supplements (PFSs) not undergoing any pre-marketing authorization, the overallquality, safety and efficacy of PFSs were subjected to a criticalexamination. Although many high-quality PFSs exist on the le-gal market, quality concerns are in general justified. Besideseconomic adulteration, active ingredients dramatically differ-ing from label claims and among products were reported in several studies. In addition, PFSs sold via the Internet may be intentionally adulterated with undeclared prescription drugs.Compared to PFSs with only one single herb, PFSs containingherbal mixtures were more involved in moderate and severeclinical courses. Although prohibited by regulation, mislead-ing labels on PFSs are common. Above all, only vague evi-dence for the efficacy of PFSs exists. Notwithstanding the un-proven efficacy and insufficient safety assessment, PFSs rep- resent a relevant source for consumers to get access to herbal preparations in the United States and meanwhile also in Eu-rope, as launching of licensed/registered European herbalmedicinal products (HMPs) decreased. However,being non-vitamin, non-mineral products, PFSs are neitherfood nor drugs. In terms of protecting public health and pro-viding the consumer with high-quality, effective, and safePFSs, possibilities are shown how to deal with the many chal- lenges of PFSs. Last but not least, suggestions are made for assigning PFSs a separate regulatory category being less reg-ulated compared to HMPs but more strictly regulated com-pared to food laws including implementation of good manu-facturing practices and a scientific pre-marketing review pro-cess by an expert commission.Do We Need Plant Food Supplements?

However, this development is accompanied with the increase of different grades and qualitiesof PFSs in the European and U. S. market. Based on that back-ground, a closer look will be taken in this paper on the regulatoryaspects, quality, efficacy, and safety of PFSs, ending up with pro-posals to optimize consumer safety. Overview on HMPs in Europe Similar to medicinal products, HMPs need a pre-MA and can bemanufactured only according to GMP by companies in possessionof a manufacturing license. They must include full tests on phar-maceutical quality and sufficient evidence for safety and efficacy.Hence, they may be granted authorization based on a \"full appli- cation \"in which the efficacy and safety are shown by data from product-specific clinical and preclinical trials in the same way as for conventional drugs. In addition, two classes of HMPs are le- gally recognized in Europe: WEU and the THMPs [4]. WEU isgranted MA based on at least 10 years use in the EU and biblio- graphical evidence on efficacy and safety [5, 6]. As WEU cannotbe demonstrated for many plant products because of lack of suf-ficient scientific data, Directive 2004/24/EC allowed a simplifiedpharmaceutical registration for HMPs with a history of TU for atleast 30 years, of which at least 15 years are in the EU [7]. Accord-ing to this directive, THMPs have to provide all information alsorequired for the MA of a medicinal product with the exception of preclinical and clinical data. Hence, efficacy and safety can be demonstrated by referring either to HMPC monographs, to ESCOPmonographs, to WHO monographs, to EC list entries or to expertreports [8]. Registered THMPs must indicate their therapeuticeffect in a specific way: \"Traditional herbal medicinal product used ...\"They must also bear the following sentence in the label- ing and package leaflet: \"The product is a traditional herbal me- dicinal product for use in specified indications exclusively based upon long-standing use \". As of March 2017, the EMA adopted 142 monographs for TU, 26 monographs for WEU, and 15 monographs for simultaneousTU and WEU. At the same time, 13 community list entries werefinalized and published in the Official Journal of the EuropeanUnion. Other list entries are pending because of incompletegenotoxicity data [2]. The total number of WEU, MA, and TUR applications since na- tional implementation of Directive 2004/24/EC until December 31, 2016, received, under assessment, granted, refused, andwithdrawn in EU member states are presented in Table 1 [9]. The maximum number of TURs reaching 374 was observed in 2011, which was the deadline to bring to conformity existingTHMPs already on the market with the new legal framework. Afterthat, the number of TURs declined, not exceeding 139 TURs in2015. The number of WEU MA granted ranged between 57 in 2005 and 92 in 2015. When looking at the different countries in Europe, a high het- erogeneity between the individual countries may be observed. Asof December 31, 2016, there were 348 TURs granted in theUnited Kingdom, 285 in Germany, 215 in Poland, 209 in Austria,100 in Spain, and 65 in Hungary while the majority of countrieslike France, Norway, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, and many othershad only registered a handful of TU products [9]. The same applies when reviewing the number of WEU author- izations granted since the implementation of Directive 2004/24/EC until December 31, 2016. Again, Germany stands out with 286authorizations, followed by Austria (56), Slovakia (49), and Sweden(46) [9]. Historical reasons, different medical and nutritional prac-tices, and different national regulatory and administrative ap-proaches can explain some but not all the heterogeneity betweenthe individual countries. Moreover, lack of resources or dedicated herbal experts as well as lack of political will in favor of herbal med- icines may be other reasons for the observed disparity [2]. EU-wide, a total of 61 different herbal substances were in- cluded in 694 WEU MA applications for mono-component HMPproducts by December 31, 2016. The main therapeutic area forwhich WEU MA have been granted are cough and cold, other,mental stress and mood disorders, urinary tract and genital disor-ders, constipation and sleep disorders, and temporary insomnia.

The largest number of WEU MA were given to the following five herbal sub-stances in descending order: ivy ( With regard to TURs, a total of 162 different herbal substances were included in 1066 mono-component THMPs in the EU by De- cember 31, 2016, with the following five herbal substances receiv- ing the largest number of TURs in descending thyme ( Thymus area addressed by mono-com-ponent and combination THMPs were cough and cold, mentalstress and mood disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, urinary tract and genital disorders, and sleep disorders and temporary in- somnia [9]. Whereas HMPs are characterized by their pharmacological ef- fect, which is scientifically evaluated, herbal products available asPFSs are marketed to supplement the normal diet and exert only aphysiological (or nutritional) effect. However, being consumed inform of tablets, capsules, and sugar-coated pills, PFSs becomemore and more drug-like in the perception of the consumer. As they may pose the risk of misleading consumers if they are as- signed qualities that they do not have, a closer look will be takenat the PFS market in Europe [8]. Overview on PFSs in Europe In general, food supplements are regulated in the EU under Direc-tive 2002/46/EC. However, PFSs are not covered by this directive, as Directive 2002/46/EC addresses mainly vitamins and minerals and does not clarify what is meant with the term \"other substance with a nutritional or physiological effect \", although it is generally understood that this could include botanicals and botanical ex-tracts. Hence, there is currently no EU legislation specifically forPFSs other than the general EU food legislation Regulation 178/2002. Ther efore, member states competent authorities supervise the PFS market according to their own criteria [10]. Some EU member states have adopted lists of authorized plants and plant parts in their legislation, like the so-called BELFRIT list used in Bel-gium, France, and Italy. Other member states work with guide-lines and/or unofficial lists. In July 2007, the Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 entered into force. It lays down harmonized rules on nutritional (Art. 8) andhealth-related claims (Art. 13 and 14) applicable to food supple-ments. According to this regulation, health claims must be based on and substantiated by generally accepted scientific evidence and must not mislead the consumer. They need to be authorizedby the European Commission and member states under the scru-tiny of the European Parliament and Council following an assess-ment of their scientific substantiation by the EFSA [8]. As theEFSA, however, considers human studies, besides monographs,to be essential for the substantiation of health claims, evidenceof TU was not considered sufficient to prove the substantiation of a health claim for PFSs. In this point, the EFSA reveals to be evenstricter than the regulatory authorities registering THMPs solely on the base of bibliographic evidence of TU. For that reason, noclaim on botanicals based on TU alone has obtained a positive as-sessment so far by the EFSA. In addition, following a request by the European Commission, the evaluations of health claims con- cerning botanicals are kept \"on hold \". Hence, different approaches exist among member states on which botanicals can be used in plant foods and under which con-ditions. Furthermore, the same botanicals are sometimes used inboth foods and medicines, and consumers may sometimes strug-gle to perceive the difference between certain indications foundon HMPs and health claims on PFSs (e.g., \"relief of minor articular pain \"vs.\"maintenance of normal joints \"or\"treatment of com- mon cold \"vs.\"supports immune system \"). Furthermore, since member states have the right to classify, on a case-by-case basis,a product as food or as medicine, it is possible that the same prod-uct is classified as food in one member state and as a medicinalproduct in another. Hence, the current market in Italy is almostcompletely represented by food supplements, whereas in coun-tries like Germany or France, the botanical market is represented by HMPs and food supplements [10]. Again, in other countries like Portugal, mostly THMPs are sold. This may lead to important dif-ferences in the level of information that is provided to consumerson products apparently similar. Based on that backgr ound, the European Commission decided to launch a reflection on whetherthis difference should be maintained or not. It is expected that afinal report on how to deal with the botanical claim situation willbe published by the end of 2017. In general, PFS usage data in the EU is scarce. The only data ad- dressing the type and frequency of PFS usage emphasizing a cleardistinction between PFSs, HMPs, and other dietary supplementsor complementary and alternative medicines are available from aretrospective survey of consumers in six European countries car-ried out by Garcia-Alvarez et al. [11]. Based on a questionnairecompleted by 2359 consumers, the estimated weighted overallPFS usage prevalence rate was 18.8% and the per-country rate was 22.7% in Italy, 19.1% in the United Kingdom, 18.0% in Spain, 17.6% in Romania, 16.9% in Germany, and 9.6% in Finland.

Overview on the Herbal Market in the United States In the United States, there is no separate category for traditional herbal medicine, as the FDA does not accept bibliographic evi-dence for efficacy but prefers randomized controlled clinical trials[10]. In general, herbal products are not marketed as drugs butare regulated in the United States by the DSHEA of 1994, whichclassifies herbs as dietary supplements that are not to be used for treating any condition or disease state but only as support for maintaining and promoting good health. Herbal dietary supple-ments can be thus produced, sold, and marketed wit hout first demonstrating safety and efficacy, as is required for pharmaceuti-cal drugs. Also, herbal dietary supplements do not need approvalfrom the FDA before being marketed. Only companies that dis-tribute or manufacture dietary supplements containing \"new die- tary ingredients \"are required to submit pre-market safety notifi- cations. According to the DSHEA, the manufacturer is responsible to determine safety and to demonstrate evidence for the claimsmade. In 2006, Congress passed the Dietary Supplement andNon-Prescription Drug Protection Act, which obligates manufac-turers of dietary supplements to report serious adverse effects tothe FDA [12]. In case a dietary supplement has to be removedfrom the market, the FDA bears the regulatory burden of provingthat the product is unsafe. As a company does not have to provide the FDA with the evidence it relies on to substantiate their claims, dietary supplement manufacturers frequently use certain \"struc- ture/function claims \", which are often vaguely worded claims of health benefits. For example, an echinacea product (often usedto treat or to prevent common cold) might claim to support thebody s natural defenses. In contrast to Europe, each dietary sup- plement package must state that the product is a \"dietary supple- ment \"and that \"These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease \"[13]. It is interest- ing that regardless of these warning statements mandatory for di-etary supplements in the United States, many herbal dietary sup-plements are nevertheless consumed to manage symptoms andtreat specific conditions [14]. Another major difference exists between dietary supplement products in the United States and food supplement products in Europe. In contrast to Europe, dietary supplement products inthe United States must be manufactured under cGMP, requiring that manufacturers verify that specifications are met for identity,purity, strength, and composition of their dietary supplements[15, 16]. According to the American Botanical Council, sales of herbal di- etary supplements increased by 7.7% in 2016, totaling an esti- mated $7.45 billion, which is the second highest rate of growthfor these products in more than a decade [17]. Among the top- selling herbal dietary supplements was horehound ( Marrubium vul- gare L., Lamiaceae) used its anti-inflammatory benefits, experienced a sales in-crease of more than 50% in 2016, being + 118.7% for frankincenseand + 85.5% for turmeric. This reflects the general rise of Ayurve-dic herbs and the increased focus on inflammation currently ob- served in the United States. In addition, many herbal dietary sup- plements are used by the U. S. population for the treatment andprevention of a wide array of ailments including common cold, de-pression, and other non-life-threatening medical conditions,although they are not regulated for this purpose. Other popularindications for use of herbal dietary supplements include bonehealth, menopause or hot flashes for women, prostate health formen, mental health, and weight loss [14]. Older adults tended to use PFSs chronically to maintain long-term organ-specific functions (e.g., preservation of bone, heart, prostate), whereasyounger adults rather used PFSs for short-term gains, such as en-hancing energy or boosting immune function [18]. Aside from the fact that marketing a PFS is definitely easier and cheaper than marketing an HMP, several other factors led to theincreasing utilization of PFSs for self-medication. Factors Responsible for the Overall Increased PFS Intake The rising significance of health issues in daily life, together with an increased possibility to self-medicate, and the aging of thepopulation seem to be the major reason for the success of PFSs[19-21]. Additional factors that promote the consumption of products of plant origin is the belief that botanicals are natural and \"natural is good \"and consequently safe [19,22]. Therefore, PFSs are used more and more to improve quality of life and well-being, support \"natural \"healing, boost the immune system, lose weight, or enhance muscle growth during body building. Further-more, PFSs are usually excluded from tight prescription regula-tions and thus can be easily purchased in pharmacies, in healthstores, in gyms, and from Internet sources. Hence, people suffer- ing from lack of time to see a physician and patients experiencing unsuccessful treatments with conventional drugs or feeling un-comfortable about discussing their medical problems have easyaccess. Moreover, manufacturers pursue systematic marketingstrategies to increase consumers awareness, assigning PFSs un- due respectability and credibility [23]. However, an imbalance exists between the increasing number of PFSs, representing a relevant source to benefit from natural substances on the one hand and the development of policies to 375Abdel-Tawab M. Do We Need ...Planta Med 2018; 84: 372 -393 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. regulate their application and safety on the other hand. Based on that background, quality, safety, and efficacy of PFSs should be allthe more subjected to a closer examination. Quality Aspects of PFSs European and U. S. regulations pertaining to food supplementsaddress issues including upper limits of safe intake, types and sub- stantiation of claims, availability of safe ingredients, increased consumer information about use, and appropriate technical re-quirements addressing food additives and contaminants [24].Mandatory quality control for PFSs features in particular the anal-ysis of heavy metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic,and the determination of microbial load, aflatoxins, pesticides, re-sidual solvents, and radioactivity [1]. In addition, supplementmanufactures in the United States are required to follow cGMP to ensure the identity, purity, quality, strength, and composition of their products. This is not obligatory for PFS manufacturers inEurope. They are also not required by law to carry out contentanalysis quantifying surrogate marker compounds or activeprinciples in their products except in the case of pre-establisheddaily intake limits (as required, for example, for hypericin or syn-ephrine). On the other hand, manufacturers of HMPs includingTHMPs using extracts complying with pharmacopoeial standards have to perform standardized extraction procedures and compre- hensive quality-control testing. In order to avoid safety concerns,PFSs in Europe are often under-dosed compared to the corre-sponding HMPs. Based on the results of studies published so far on the quality of PFSs, quality concerns are in general justified. Often, manufac-turers of finished PFSs, whether in Europe or in the United States,do not handle the unprocessed botanicals by themselves but buy herbs that have been already processed into powders or extracts. Thus, they have no opportunity to authenticate the material theybought by morphology [25]. Hence, certain segments of theherbal supplement market may easily practice so-called economicadulteration, substituting a less-expensive for a more-expensiveingredient, including related substitute species and cheap fillers[26, 27]. In a study conducted by Booker et al., 33 out of 35 testedginkgo products sold as food supplements in health food stores, supermarkets, and pharmacies in the Central London area and via the Internet were found to contain elevated levels of rutinand/or quercetin or low levels of ginkgo metabolites comparedwith the reference samples. Such samples with disproportionallevels of rutin or quercetin compared with other ginkgo metabo-lites are likely to be adulterated, either by accident or intentional-ly, and those samples with low or non-existing gingko metabolitesare likely to have been produced using poor extraction techniques [27]. Also, a study of the Central Laboratory of German Pharma- cists reported disproportional levels of quercetin in 7 out of 10ginkgo supplements obtained from German health food stores,drug stores, and pharmacies. In light of the high production costs,these findings are not surprising, as 50 kg dried ginkgo leaves areneeded to obtain 1 kg of pharmacologically active ginkgo extractcomplying with pharmacopoeial standard [28]. Similar observa-tions were made in the United States. In order to save costs but nevertheless accounting for achieving the desired 24% flavonolglycoside content, some extract providers or supplement manu- facturers manipulated the extract composition or stretched gink-go extracts with pure flavonols (e.g., rutin, quercetin, Japanese sophora(Styphnolobium japonicum L., Burseraceae), pretending a quality that does not exist [29]. It is also apparent that black raspberry di-etary supplement producers and sellers are not able to differenti-ate between black raspberry and blackberry, as often wrong im- ages are posted on the supplements packaging [30]. Regarding the consistency of chemical contents, several stud- ies documented dramatically different levels of labeled active in-gredients in PFSs [13]. Hence, a study on the quality of frankin-cense containing PFSs including 17 top-selling products from Eu-rope and the United States revealed that 41% of the products didnot comply with the label declaration. Hence, one product fromItaly did not contain any of the six characteristic BAs (KBA, AKBA, BA,BA, A BA, A BA) at all, and another U.S. product contained only traces, suggesting the absence of frankincense or the use ofanother species like Boswellia serrata Roxb. (Burseraceae). In another product, the ratios of the individual BAs were different from B. serrata gum resin, indicating also the use of another species such as two products revealed different BA contents from those declared on the label. Further, two products did not declare the use of manipulated Boswellia gum resin extract being enriched in AKBA content reaching up to 66% [31]. A furtherstudy on 25 products from the genera P. ginseng and Eleutherococ- cus senticosus Rupr. et Maxim. (Araliaceae) obtained from a local U.S. health food store found a 15- to 200-fold variation in the con-centration of ginsenosides and eleutherosides [32]. Another studyshowed that the ginsenoside contents of 232 P. ginseng and 81Panax quinquefolius L. (Araliaceae) products marketed as com- mercial ginseng products in North America ranged from 0.00% to13.54% and from 0.009% to 8.00%, respectively, and that 26% of these products did not meet label claims. Also, the eleuthero-sides B and E content of eleuthero root powder and other formu-lated extract products showed large variation [33 -35]. Studies on the quality of St. John s wort products showed hypericin content ranging from 47% to 165% of label claim [36]. Similarly, silymarin was detected at 58 -116% of label claim [33]. Also, 7 of 19 black raspberry ( Rubus occidentalis L. Rosaceae) products purchased in the time from May to July 2013 from Amazon.com contained noanthocyanin from black raspberry fruit, while three of those sevenhad no anthocyanins of any kind. The remaining products re-vealed a wide range of anthocyanin concentration ranging from0.1 to 145.2 mg per capsule [30]. Moreover, FDA inspections of manufacturing facilities have re- vealed GMP violations in about two-thirds of all inspections. Com- monly identified problems include failure to verify that a finishedbatch meets product specifications for identity, purity, strength,and composition, failure to verify the identity of a dietary ingre-dient prior to use, and failure to establish and to follow writtenprocedures for quality-control operations [26]. In addition, a large number of PFSs sold via the Internet are in- tentionally adulterated, especially those that carry claims about weight loss and male sexual performance containing undeclared 376Abdel-Tawab M. Do We Need ...Planta Med 2018; 84: 372 -393Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. prescription drugs or synthetic analogues of them [10]. The amounts of these undeclared synthetic ingredients may even ex-ceed the therapeutic dose of the particular pharmaceutical [24].Hence, weight-loss products frequently contain sibutramine,which has been withdrawn from the European and U. S. marketbecause of its association with strokes and cardiovascular events.According to the FDA list of tainted food supplements from a totalof 416 public alerts launched between 2010 and 2015, 37% cor- responded to adulterated weight-loss products, from which most cases (87%) involved the illegal addition of sibutramine [37]. Illicitweight-loss products have also been reported to contain other anorexics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, di-uretics, and laxatives [38, 39]. As a result of the weight-loss-induc-ing side effects of the hypoglycemic drug metformin, this com-pound can also be found in weight-loss supplements, often withother adulterants such as sibutramine and phenolphthalein [40]. Nutritional supplements advertised as metabolic activating agents and fat burners revealed to contain high amounts of caf-feine, enhancementof athletic performance contain analogues of amphetamines,and herbal supplements for sexual health frequently contain silde-nafil or other PDE-5 inhibitors [43]. It has been estimated that in Europe, six million illicit products containing PDE-5 inhibitors have been purchased outside the official health system. In the Nether-lands alone, 75% of sexual enhancement supplements seized con-tained PDE-5 analogues [44]. Also, own test purchases carried outby the Central Laboratory of German Pharmacists revealed thatevery other PFS obtained from illegal Internet sites was adulter-ated with synthetic PDE-5 inhibitors. The presence of various hy-poglycemic drugs like glibenclamide, rosiglitazone, and metfor- min has been also reported in PFSs claiming to regulate the con- centration of blood sugar or to treat diabetes mellitus [45, 46].Other studies have revealed adulteration of herbal supplementsclaiming to be effective in lowering or maintaining optimal bloodpressure with various ibuprofen, diclofe-nac, naproxen) have been also found in herbalproducts intended for management of rheumatoid arthritis, ecze-ma, or chronic back pain [48]. Therefore, it may be difficult for patients to ascertain with cer- tainty the precise contents of the PFS they may be interested intaking [13]. This applies not only for products bought from illegal Internet websites but also for products obtained from the official health system. Of course, the insights obtained above in the qual-ity of PFSs cannot be generalized and it is beyond question thatalso high-quality PFSs exist in the legal market and that many PFSmanufacturers are beginning to significantly improve their qualitystandards. Nevertheless, the quality of PFSs still varies from oneproduct to another and still many companies sell low-qualityproducts, some containing unknown/unreported ingredients not to speak of missing efficacy and safety.Safety Aspects of PFSs The common misconception that botanicals are harmless and de- void of adverse effects often leads to improper use and unre-stricted intake, resulting in increased incidence of side effectsand drug interactions [49,50]. Hence, the growing use of PFSs isaccompanied by an increasing concern particularly because no pre-marketing safety assessment is required. Being considered as foods in Europe, PFSs are subjected to the disposition of theGeneral Food Law (Regulation [EC] 178/2002), with the responsi-bilities for food safety issues mainly relying on the food businessoperator [51, 52]. Nevertheless, the EFSA issued a guidance, inwhich a general framework for safety assessment of botanicalsand botanical preparations is presented [51]. Also, in the UnitedStates PFSs do not require any approval from the FDA before being introduced in the market. Hence, manufacturers do not have to provide evidence for safety and effectiveness of their products,but they are prohibited to market unsafe or ineffective products.In general, data on safety and adverse effects of PFSs in Europeand the United States are scarce, mainly because PFSs are stillnot covered well under the pharmacovigilance scheme and onlyindividual case reports or case series on single plants are reportedin the literature [19, 53]. Based on the Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers in the United States, no death cases couldbe attributed to dietary supplements [54]. The most commoncalls involving PFSs represented minor problems involving caf-feine-containing dietary supplements (often the content of caf-feine is not listed on the label) followed by yohimbine products[55]. In order to fill the gap of scarce data in Europe, a multicenter retrospective review of data from selected European and Brazilian poison centers involving human cases of adverse effects due toplants consumed as food or ingredients of food supplements be-tween 2006 and 2010 was performed as part of the EU projectPlantLIBRA (Levels of Intake, Benefit, and Risk Assessment) [19,56]. Ten poison centers provided a total of 75 cases originatingfrom all over Europe (Finland 9, France 31, Germany 4, Italy 13,Serbia 4, Sweden 5, Switzerland 5) and Brazil (4). In 57 cases (76%), a PFS was involved, and in 18 (24%), a plant was ingested as food. Whereas the number of involved PFSs containing only oneingredient was comparable to that with more than one ingre-dient, the latter were more frequently associated with moderateand severe clinical courses (33.3%) compared to PFSs with oneingredient (10%). The most frequently observed clinical effectswere neurotoxicity (n = 34) and gastrointestinal symptoms(n = 24). This is in accordance with data from the Italian pharma- covigilance center on spontaneously reported adverse effects of natural health products including homeopathics [57]. Other or-gans/organ systems reported in the PlantLIBRA project to be in-volved in adverse effects were the cardiovascular system (n = 13),skin/mucosa (n = 8), the liver (n = 4), the respiratory system( n=2 ) ,t h ek i d n e y( n=1 ) ,a n do t h e ro r g a ns y s t e m s( n=5 ) .I nt o -tal, 58 different plants were consumed as ingredients of PFSs or asfood. The 15 plants in this study involved in three or more cases of adverse effects are listed in Table 2 [19]. 377Abdel-Tawab M.

In 59 (79%) of the 75 cases, only one organ/organ system was involved. In 14 cases, two organs/organ systems were involved,and two cases had more than two organs/organ systems involved.The signs and symptoms observed in the 75 cases with adverseeffects after the ingestion of a PFS or a plant are summarized in Table 3 [19]. The plant most commonly involved in cases of adverse effects in this study was valerian ( V. officinalis ). The observed adverse re- actions included somnolence, drowsiness, and gastrointestinalsymptoms. The neurological symptoms can be well explained byvalerian s properties as a relaxant and sleep aid [19, 58]. Only two cases, using a multi-ingredient PFS were severe. In one case,a 30-year-old man, who recovered completely, was using a prod-uct containing bitter orange ( Citrus ( Rhodiola rosea L., Crassulaceae) to lose weight. Be- sides a weight loss of 18 kg in two months, he suffered a myocar-dial infarction during sexual activity. In the other case, a 40-year-old man suffered a transient ischemic attack a few hours after theingestion of a single recommended dose of a PFS containing gin-seng ( P. L., however, the origin of the in- gested PFS is not known, it cannot be excluded that these PFSswere obtained from the Internet and have been adulterated withsynthetic drugs. Most cases, however, showed a benign clinicalcourse with mild outcome. The symptoms most commonly re- corded in the moderate cases of this study were -apart from gas- trointestinal symptoms -edema and hypokalemia sometimes ac-companied by hypertension or ECG changes. In all of these cases, licorice ( Glycyrrhiza glabra L., Fabaceae) was involved. These ob- correspond well to the known effect of glycyrrhetic ac-id, which influences the electrolyte balance by inhibiting the 11 - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 enzyme, leading to an aldo-sterone-like effect. Consequently, the renin-angiotensin-aldoste-rone axis is suppressed, which causes volume expansion, hyper- tension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis [19,53,59,60]. In general, most reported adverse events in the literature might be associated with green tea ( C. sinensis ), black cohosh G. glabra ), and soy bean ( G. max )[ 5 3 ] .I n cases where no clear assignment of the reported effects to a PFSor HMP can be made because of the different classifications in dif-ferent countries, the reported effects will be assigned in the fol- lowing to the respective herb in general. While green tea infusion is widely consumed and may be con- sidered generally safe, PFSs with green tea extracts have shown tohave a hepatotoxic potential. This is attributed to the differentcomposition of infusion and extracts. Whereas infusions andaqueous extracts contain mostly hydrophilic compounds, hydro-alcoholic extracts contain both hydrophilic and lipophilic compo-nents, and powdered leaves contain all of the tea active compo- nents [53]. In total, 19 cases of hepatotoxicity related to the con- sumption of PFSs containing green tea were identified until 2015,mostly in women (16/19). The causality assessment between con-sumption of herbal preparations and hepatic reaction resulted as\"probable \"in eight cases and as \"possible \"in 11 cases. In seven cases, patients used preparations containing only green tea, while12 reactions involved patients who took MC preparations. Com-pared to single ingredient products, the reactions induced by MC were more serious, with four cases involving liver transplantation. As the MC preparations contained numerous other componentsTable 2 Overview of the fifteen plants involved in three or more cases of adverse effects after ingestion of a PFS or a plant as food in the 75 cases recorded by L\u00fcde et al. according to data from [19].

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. also suspected to induce liver damage, it is difficult to ascribe the hepatotoxicity to one specific component as, for example, greentea [61]. Patients experienced acute hepatotoxicity following theintake of green tea ( C. sinensis ) in the form of a PFS containing hy- droalcoholic extracts revealed clinical symptoms with different se-verity ranging from a mild increase in serum aminotransferases tofulminant hepatitis requiring liver transplantation [19,62,63]. The mechanism of hepatotoxicity remains unclear, but many fac- tors may be related to the patient and to catechins and their gallicesters, in particular EGCG, which can induce oxidative stress andliver damage in certain conditions as fasting. The association withEGCG seems further confirmed by the lack of adverse effects incase of fermented teas as black tea, in which the content of EGCGis significantly reduced [53, 61]. In summary, the present dataconsidering the great use of this supplement confirm a certain safety concern with green tea, even if the number of hepatic reac- tions is low. A major safety concern exists when green tea is asso-ciated with other ingredients that may additionally enhance the risk of liver damage [61]. In case of black cohosh ( C. racemosa ), 19 papers describe spe- cific adverse effects, among which 14 were classified as \"certain/ probable \"and five were classified as \"possible \". The adverse reac- tions resulted from the chronic ingestion of black cohosh extractsas such or as ingredient of a PFS [53,64 -70]. In the case of hepa- totoxicity, the event was quickly reversible after discontinuation, except in two cases where liver transplantation became necessary and in one case where the event was fatal [64, 69]. Also, when in-gested as an HMP, black cohosh ( C. racemosa ) was associated with five serious reports related to the liver as described by Svedlund etal. in their study on spontaneously reported adverse reactions re-sulting from HMPs and natural remedies in Sweden in the timefrom 2007 to 2015 [71]. Despite the limited available nonclinicaland clinical data, liver toxicity has been also associated with the use of black cohosh by the European Community, as discussed in the assessment report pertinent to the European Communityherbal monographs on C. racemosa orange ( C. aurantium )c o n t a i n p-synephrine, which has many of the pharmacological properties as ephedrineand therefore the potential to cause many of the same side effects[13]. Hence, adverse effects associated with bitter orange dietaryweight-loss supplement concern mainly the cardiovascular sys- tem [53, 74]. Ischemic colitis was also reported [75]. In combina- tion with caffeine, statistically significant increases in systolic anddiastolic blood pressure (approximately 9 mmHg) and pulse (16.7beats per minute) were observed in healthy adults [76]. Patientstaking such products also reported insomnia or feeling jittery[13]. Often, bitter orange extracts used in herbal weight-loss for-mulas have higher concentrations of p-synephrine than reported for the traditional extracts of the dried fruit or peel [77]. This re- flects another important issue to be taken into account when as- sessing the safety of PFSs -that is, that some preparations of a bo- tanical may be marketed containing significantly higher levels ofactive (toxic) principles than those normally occurring in historicalfood of the same botanical [78]. Nevertheless, the adverse effectscases with regard to bitter orange were mainly classified as \"pos- sible \"due to the frequent presence of accompanying conditions, such as obesity, hypothyroidism, asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Although products containing widely used plants for weight loss such as green tea ( C. marketed as highly effective, adverse events were onlyrarely recorded. Reasons for this observation might be the diffi-culty of finding these products in legal shops due to regulatory re- strictions based on their negative safety profiles or the fear of car- diotoxic side effects attributed to the presence of stimulantamines as synephrine and octapamine [19,74,79]. The adverse effects due to soy bean ( G. max ) are mainly asso- ciated with the well-known allergic potential of soy bean, which isincluded in the major allergens requiring specific labeling. Thesecond most important group of side effects is associated withthe postulated pseudohormonal activity of the isoflavone fraction and include ureteral M\u00fcllerian carcinosarcoma associated with en-Table 3 Observed signs and symptoms in the 75 cases with ad- verse effects after ingestion of a PFS or a plant as food according to data from [19].

Other case reports associated with soy bean with satisfactory demonstration of causality are gastrointestinaladverse effects including enterocolitis, vomiting, abdominal pain,and diarrhea [81]. Because of contradictory findings from in vitro and animal studies, a definitive safety assessment of isoflavone in-take can still not be made. However, according to Wolters andHahn, a daily oral dose of 50 mg isoflavones may be regarded assafe and it may be assumed that a short-term intake of soy bean is not associated with significant adverse effects [82]. However, women with breast cancer s hould avoid long-term use of soy products or isolated isoflavones [83]. Interestingly, some manu-facturers advertise the presence and others the absence of isofla-vones in their PFS products. Other herbs ginkgo (G. r t( H. perforatum ), Devil sc l a w( H. L., Lamiaceae) appear to be relatively safe, with observed adverse effects not exceeding indi-vidual reports [53]. Generally speaking, in spite of some fatal cases, given the large number of plants and the widespread use of PFSs, the occurrenceof adverse effects by PFSs is relatively low and the number of se-vere clinical reactions is very limited. Nevertheless, these findingsshould be handled with care, as it cannot be excluded that adverse effects are detected only to a small extent by poison centers, as can be deduced from a one-year poison center surveillance proj-ect [19,55]. According to this study conducted in the UnitedStates, only 0.4% of the calls concerned dietary supplements, ofwhich 33% were due to adverse effects. Moreover, it has beenconfirmed that people do not think of poison centers as informa-tion centers and often do not report their use of dietary supple-ments to the physician [20, 84]. In addition, adverse effects caused by PFSs may be underestimated because most PFSs do not provide safety information encouraging consumers to consid-er PFSs as safe, which results in not reporting their use when ad-mitted to hospital or emergency service [53]. Hence, the true fre-quency of side effects for most herbs is not known in particularbecause most have not been tested in large clinical trials. Of concern are also PFSs contaminated with pesticides, heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and arsenic, microbial agents, and mycotoxins as well as PAs, alkenylbenzenes, or aristolochic acids [78, 85 -87]. dehydro-alkaloid metabolites that alkylate DNA and other macro-molecules, causing liver cell necrosis and liver cancer [78]. BesidesPAs detected recently in commercially available medicinal teas, sixbatches of St. John s wort tablets have been precautionary re- called in the United Kingdom because of potentially toxic PA levelsdue to product contamination genotoxic andcarcinogenic 1 -sulfooxy-metabolites that bind to DNA and cause liver cancer. Aristolochic acid I and II undergo reductive metabolicactivation by cytochromes P450 and/or other enzymes, reactive nitrenium ion metabolites that cause Chi-nese herb nephropathy and urethelial cancers [78]. Because of sloppy control measures, it cannot be excluded that products con-taining these plant constituents are offered on the market, thus presenting a considerable safety concern. Whereas contamination of PFSs is generally an unintentional event that results from growing, spraying, and harvesting of theherbal plant, adulteration with prescription drugs is typically driv-en by a desire to increase or alter the claimed effect of the PFS togain a commercial advantage. Hence, the most significant safetyconcern results from the sale of adulterated PFSs. Adulterants that should not be present in PFSs may be introduced into the supply chain at any step between the planting, production, andpackaging phase of the marketed formulation. In weight-loss sup-plements, drug adulterants that have been identified include si-butramine, fenfluramine, and phenolphthalein [39,90]. All ofthese drugs have been removed from the market due to safetyconcerns. Other adulterants that have been identified the ba- sis of reports from a nationally representative sample of emer-gency departments from 2004 through 2013, it was estimatedthat weight-loss products causing cardiac symptoms (palpita-tions, chest pain, or tachycardia), headache, dizziness, nausea,vomiting, or mild or moderate allergic reactions were implicatedin 25.5% of emergency department visits [92]. In the case of sup-posedly pure herbal sexual performance-enhancing supplements, high rates of product adulteration with PDE-5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil as their analogues rang-ing 37% and 81%, have been observed [37,93,94]. For amore detailed insight into the adulteration rate of dietary supple-ments the review of Rocha et al. may be consulted [37]. The use ofthese compounds and analogues can pose considerable dangersto consumers, as they may contain toxic constituents or sub-stances whose safety has never been examined before and whose interaction with medication may be unpredictable and lethal. Considering that these adulterated products are, beyond that,consumed without medical supervision by consumers withoutknowing that these ingredients are present, they represent a sig-nificant threat to consumer health. In fact, the FDA received nu-merous reports of serious adverse events associated with con-sumer use of these tainted products including strokes, acute liverinjury, kidney failure, pulmonary embolisms, and even death [95]. Not surprisingly, muscle-building supplements have also often been found to be adulterated with anabolic steroids or aromataseinhibitors, both classified as prescription drugs. Also de novo syn- thesized androgenic compounds, so-called designer steroids, thathave structural similarities to testosterone and are more difficultto detect by standard chromatographic and spectroscopic tech-niques may be included. With the exception of dehydroepiandros-terone, most anabolic steroids are designated as Schedule-3 con- trolled substances. As a consequence of consumer usage of sup- plements that are illegally spiked with anabolic steroids, hepato-toxicity continues to be reported [18]. Although the FDA has is-sued warnings about 300 tainted products that can cause seriousadverse events including stroke, organ failure, and death, someadulterated products remain in the marketplace even after recalls.Hence, 27 supplements recalled because of adulteration weretested at least six months after being recalled. Sixty-three percent (17/27) contained the same pharmaceutical adulterant identified 380Abdel-Tawab M.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. previously by the FDA, and six contained one or more additional banned ingredients [37,96]. In summary, safety of PFSs may be compromised by several factors including the use of wrong species of plant by mistake,adulteration of herbal products with other undeclared medicines,contamination with toxic or hazardous substances, overdosages,misuse and long-term use of multi-ingredient PFSs by consumers,and use of PFSs concomitantly with other medicines. Interaction Aspects of PFSs An important but mainly under-investigated safety concern is thepotential for popular PFSs to interact with drugs. Although the po-tential for drug-drug interactions must be investigated for all newdrugs, and many interactions have been documented, drug-PFSinteractions remain underexplored [97]. Drug-PFS supplement in- or induction of P450 enzymes, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, other phase I and II enzymes in-volved in drug metabolism, drug transporters and drug-effluxproteins. By inhibiting the action of specific drug-metabolizingenzymes, PFSs may prolong the half-lives of drugs, which may re-sult in prolonged action and even toxicity. On the other hand, in-hibition of enzymes can also prevent prodrugs from exerting theirpharmacological effects. Moreover, if herbal compounds are highly bound to serum proteins, they may displace other drugs from this protein, which may lead to an increase in the concentra-tion of the free drug to toxic levels. An example of a well-docu-mented interaction is the induction of CYP3A4 by St. John sw o r t , leading to lower efficacy of many drugs like oral contraceptivesand the anticoagulant warfarin [98 -100]. Although St. John s wort has generated the most publicity regarding safe use, nearlytwo-thirds of 15 preparations (13 unlicensed PFSs and two THMPs) obtained from British health food shops, pharmacies, and supermarkets failed to mention any of the possible interac-tions with conventional medicines such as the oral contraceptiveor warfarin. Only the two registered THMPs and two unlicensedproducts obtained from pharmacies informed the consumerabout eight possible interactions [101]. This is consistent withfindings in the United States, indicating that manufacturers ofthe vast majority of St. John s wort preparations failed to ade- quately address clinically relevant safety issues [102]. Also, for green tea supplements, interactions have been reported withconventional drugs, especially with statins, where an increase inplasma concentrations and a worsening of the related side ef-fects, such as rhabdomyolysis, were observed [54, 103]. For many other herbs like black cohosh, gingko, ginseng, milk thistle, sawpalmetto, and valerian, preclinical assays predicted drug interac-tions that revealed, however, to be of no clinical relevance when tested in humans [97]. In general, there are considerable discrep- ancies between preclinical data and corresponding clinical re-sponses. In the case of ginseng, for example, preclinical studieswith human liver cells predicted drug interactions that were notmanifested in a clinical trial [97, 104]. A similar outcome was ob-served for ginkgo, when preclinical work with both recombinantprotein and liver microsomes predicted inhibition of several P450enzymes, but no drug-ginkgo interactions were observed in a clinical trial [97,105 -107]. These examples indicate that a clinicaltrial often fails to confirm drug-herb interactions that were pre- dicted by common preclinical experiments. A possible reason forthat might be the use of different extract types and differentdoses. Another reason for these inconsistencies might be thatpreclinical assays do not take into account the bioavailability ofdifferent natural substances. If substances are not absorbed afteroral administration, then they would be unlikely to have any ef-fects on phase I metabolism in humans. The frequency of botani- cal natural products showing P450 inhibition in preclinical studies without similar effects in humans suggests that most preclinicalmethods are overestimating inhibition [97]. Similar concernsabout disagreements across literature resources and databasesfor drug interaction have been raised before [108,109]. This in-creases the difficulty of implementing an evidence-based clinicalpractice for PFS products. Another limitation is the concern ofpublication bias, which might arise as only evidence-based herbal products are predominantly published in the literature. Therefore, there might be many more PFS-drug interactions that exist butare simply without documented outcomes [108]. In general, how-ever, for PFSs with a long history of use without incident, the riskfor drug interactions is likely to be low. In summary, it may be concluded that the safety of using most herbs with drugs is not well established and most of the currentevidence for interactions is based on case reports while systemat- ic investigations are missing. Therefore, it is difficult for consum- ers to make an informed decision. Hence, health-care profession-als and consumers should pay more attention toward interactionsbetween any PFSs and a drug, especially those patients usingmedications that have a narrow therapeutic range (i.e., warfarin,digoxin), as they are at greater risk for adverse outcomes becauseof PFS-drug interactions. Furthermore, health-care professionalsmust always question patients about use of herbal products. Efficacy Aspects of PFSs PFSs cover a wide range of applications involving, therefore, awide range of plants. Some preparations contain only one ingre-dient, which may be either an extract (or concentrate) of a singleplant, while other PFSs are combinations of several plants. In gen-eral, the number of studies carried out in the field of dietary sup- plements for non-vitamin, non-mineral products, especially herbs, is significantly fewer than those for vitamin-mineral supple-ments [13]. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses supported effi-cacy for St. John s wort for mild but not severe depression, ginkgo for existing dementia, garlic for hypercholesterimia, and saw pal-metto for benign prostate hyperplasia. Moreover, ginger wasfound to be effective for nausea, hawthorn leaf/flower for mildheart failure, and feverfew for migraines. On the other hand, the efficacy evidence was mixed for echinacea for cold, ginseng for physical performance, and green tea for cancer [13, 110 -123]. With regard to PFSs used for menopausal symptom relief, includ-ing black cohosh and plant extracts with supposed estrogenic ac-tivities as soy bean, the scientific evidence of efficacy is scarce andhighly variable [124]. Hence, black cohosh revealed not to be su-perior to placebo for menopausal symptoms and relief of hotflashes in recent clinical trials [125]. In case of soy bean, the North American Menopause Society concluded that soy-based isofla- 381Abdel-Tawab M. Do We Need ...Planta Med 2018; 84: 372 -393 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. vones are modestly effective in relieving menopausal symptoms. On the other hand, a meta-analysis of the use of soy bean supple-ments for hot flashes showed a statistically significant decrease inhot flashes, in spite of questionable clinical efficacy [126,127]. Inturn, another review published by the Cochrane Collaborative on43 randomized controlled trials concluded that there was no con-clusive evidence that soy supplements reduced menopausal hotflashes [128]. However, it should be pointed out that the proven efficacy or non-efficacy can only be assigned to the composition of the herb included in that specific study and cannot be generallyextended to another extract of the same species properly with adifferent composition and different preparation procedure.Therefore, scientific studies on the effects of a specific PFS can dif-fer according to the species of plants used in the product, thesources of the botanical, how the botanicals are prepared, howthe product is formulated, and how the product is standardized. Each of these variables can affect the biologic effects of PFSs and the outcome of a scientific study. As much scientific evidenceoften suffers from poor methodology, inconsistent outcome mea-sures, and conflicting results, larger placebo-controlled clinical tri-als are needed with fully standardized extracts before questions ofefficacy can be reliably answered [13, 97]. In a study on Internet marketing carried out in the United States, more than half of the products were found to have mislead- ing labels illegally claiming to treat, prevent, diagnose, or cure spe- cific diseases, indicating that although prohibited by regulations,illegal and erroneous marketing claims for PFSs are common [13,129,130]. In this context, the FDA has cited manufacturers of hun-dreds of products for promising relief from a wide variety of dis-eases including diabetes, heart disease, HIV/AIDS, and cancer in re-cent years [26]. However, there are also reports of deceptive mar-keting of products sold in European retail stores and on websites [129]. This is reflected in the health claims made for ginkgo prom- ising improved blood circulation, effects on symptoms of age, andimproved memory with statements like the following that couldnot be substantiated for Dutch PFSs containing G. biloba :\"helps for cold hands and feet \";\"improves memory \";\"natural memory booster \";\"protects against symptoms of old age \".I nf a c t ,t h e WHO monographs indicates the use of G. biloba for symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate cerebrovascular insufficiency, im- provement of pain-free walking distance in patients with peripher- al arterial occlusive disease, and treatment of inner ear problemslike tinnitus. However, these are medical claims supported only bythe most widely cited two extracts in the scientific literature - EGb761 and LI1370 (being standardized extracts of dry G. biloba leaves extracted with acetone and water containing 22 -27% of fla- vones glycosides gink- golide A, B, and C, and 2.6 -3.2% of bilobalide as well as concentra- tions of ginkgolic acids below 5 ppm) -and are prohibited for PFSs. In the study assessing the health claims of 29 herbal supplementscontaining ginkgo, conducted in the time from August to Septem-ber 2005 in the Netherlands, 25 products mentioned claims forpositive influence on memory and/or concentration or improve-ment of blood circulation. Only four products did not have anyclaims on the label. For 16 products, the detailed content and therecommended dose was declared on the label, whereas the decla- ration for the other 13 products was unclear insofar that the rec-ommended dose was stated, but not the amount of flavonoid and terpene lactone. When the components of the PFSs were eval-uated according to the guideline for pharmaceuticals that requiresthe presence of 90 -110% of the declared amount, only one out of the 29 PFSs met this criterion. Moreover, 16 products did not meetthe dose range for terpene lactones and flavonoids for a 24%standardized extract [131]. Such unauthorized claims misleadconsumers into buying the advertised products and subject them to unknown risk with no clear evidence of efficacy. Consumers may be also misled by outdated literature or refer- ences to in vitro studies performed at dosages that can never be achieved in humans following oral administration. This was partic-ularly evident for some studies cited by the manufacturers in thecase of PFS products using an AKBA-enriched extract. Hence, theliterature referred to highlighted the 5-LO inhibitory effect ofAKBA in vitro , although it was recently shown that AKBA never ap- proaches the concentrations needed to modulate the addressed target even when large dosages of AKBA were administered dueto lack of sufficient absorption [36]. Furthermore, the potential for toxicity originating from certain herbs is compounded by the frequent use of misleading market-ing information. For example, a systematic review of bitter orangefor weight loss identified only one methodologically flawed studyexamining the effect of the herb, which incorrectly reported a sta- tistically significant benefit for weight loss, whereas the herb was not more effective than placebo. This misleading article was oftencited as \"published scientific evidence \"of the efficacy of bitter orange for weight loss without mentioning the side effects [13,132]. In summary, there is vague evidence for the efficacy of PFSs [133]. Nevertheless, consumers are not held back from consum-ing PFSs even by the warning statements mandatory for PFSs in the United States and the negative reports from market analysts regarding adulteration and poor quality of some PFSs on the mar-ket [52]. Therefore, measures have to be taken to increase thequality and the reliability of these products in spite of the chal-lenges generally associated with PFSs. Challenges Associated with PFSs In view of the increasing use of PFSs, it is essential to understandthat, being botanicals, there are in fact very different challengesfor PFSs that need to be resolved [134], as can be depicted fromthe above with regard to the following. Quality The quality of the products on the market may be a great issue. In the absence of standardization, comprehensive product analysis cannot ensure batch-to-batch product reproducibility. Different parts of the plant, stem, leaf, or root provide differ- ent quantities of active ingredients. The composition of products derived from the same botanical drug will differ unless very similar extraction and processingsteps are followed. Moreover, other factors like environmentalconditions (e.g., soil type, year of growth, geographic location,climate, plant selection, and cultivation) play an important role, leading to content variability. 382Abdel-Tawab M. Do We Need ...Planta Med 2018; 84: 372 -393Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. The general lack of knowledge about the active ingredients in herbal material makes it difficult to anticipate which individualcomponents are critical for product characterization and re-producibility. Often, supplements are standardized to the content of single irrelevant phytoconstituents, while the contents of nonstan-dardized constituents may vary widely between products andeven within manufactured lots. Unless active ingredients are known, any dissolution or shelf life testing would have to rely on marker compounds withprobably different solubility or stability profiles compared tounidentified bioactive constituents. Clear, well-established reference standards are missing for chemical fingerprinting. Whereas some marker/bioactive compounds are commercially available for some of the major PFSs, many others are not. Methods for the quality control of finished PFSs remain far more complex than for other synthetic pharmaceuticals; espe-cially for mixture products, it is difficult to ascertain the inclu-sion of all plants. Multiple analytical approaches may be re-quired to provide sufficiently comprehensive information. Analysis for the absence of all undeclared pharmaceutical com- pounds is difficult to perform because of the large number ofpharmaceuticals and novel analogues. Penalties imposed for adulteration are not proportionate to the infringements committed, so they do not have a deterringeffect. Nevertheless, despite these hurdles, it has to be mentioned that there has been already a notable progress in the development ofadvanced methods to qualitatively and quantitatively measure in-gredients and screen for contaminants and adulterants in PFSs [18, 135]. With a more routine application of such methods in conjunction with the emergence of accessible product-specificfingerprint databases, it is expected in the future that the scien-tific authentication of botanical products and identification ofcandidate compounds, adulterants, or contaminants will becomemuch easier. Discrepancy between in vitro results and observed in vivo effects The use of high concentrations of single constituents in in vitro studies, although in fact the PFS is a complex mixture, can re-sult in exposing the in vitro system to exaggerated and unreal- istic conditions, as compounds in a mixture may have additiveor antagonistic activities that may not be apparent when anentity is tested in isolation [136]. Testing PFS components in cell culture for metabolism or transport studies can prove extremely difficult when single components are essentially insoluble in different solvents. The potential influence of excipients, generally regarded as in- ert, which are added into various oral dosage formulations in-cluding lactose, starch, microcrystalline cellulose, stearate lu-bricants, and others when performing in vitro orin vivo assess- ments of drug interactions, are seldom considered [137]. Additionally, the variability between what are supposed to be the same products, the lot-to-lot variability, and the differ-ences in recommended dosage, dose frequency, and duration of dosing regimens make extrapolations of in vitro findings to thein vivo situation exceedingly difficult [138]. Safety assessment Poor quality of data reported to regulatory agencies is a com- mon challenge. This pertains especially to questionnaires ofadverse drug reactions regarding liver toxicity that are not spe- cific for toxic liver diseases and the uncertainty associated with unregulated PFSs with regard to the ingredients actually in-cluded as well as the dosage regimen and comedication [139]. As a specific and valid diagnostic laboratory marker for herb- induced liver injury and drug-induced liver injury is lacking,the diagnosis of herb-induced liver injury and drug-induced liv-er injury requires a thorough clinical assessment and an appro-priate diagnostic algorithm like the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences/Roussel Uclaf Causality As- sessment Method scale that considers specific hepatotoxicitycharacteristics. Often insufficient efforts are made to assessand exclude alternative causes [140]. A frequent problem encountered in the conduction of in vitro studies for possible interactions is the uncertainty in assigningconclusive hepatic concentrations of multiple constituents andtheir potential metabolites, accounting for oral bioavailability and first-pass metabolism. Consequently, the evaluation of ex- isting literature turns out to be difficult in view of using inap-propriately high concentrations of single isolated constituentsinin vitro studies when only a small fraction may be actually bioavailable [138]. There is lack of scientific evidence to evaluate safety and effi- cacy of PFSs. The long history of safe use of botanicals does not include soci- ety s current use of prescription and over-the-counter medica- tions [134]. There is currently more speculation than fact in the area of safety assessment of PFSs [137]. In some instances, safety issues can arise from confusion due to similarity in the popular names used for certain plants. Aprominent example is the potential for confusion of black co-hosh 134]. No sufficient safety information is provided with the products. Clinical data The same complexity valid for dissolution testing applies also to the determination of the bioavailability of PFSs [134]. For almost all PFSs, there is little or no adequate pharmacoki- netic data available, and of the small numbers that are avail- able, overall conclusions are limited because of the use of dif- ferent formulations, different or unknown dosages, and differ-ences in measured analytes [ 138]. Publication bias resulting from positive studies receiving pref- erential treatment may lead to a selective overestimation ofthe health benefits of some PFSs. Clinical trials on PFSs are often small in size and of short dura- tion. 383Abdel-Tawab M. Do We Need ...Planta Med 2018; 84: 372 -393 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. A great variability between published outcomes from appar- ently similar studies is often seen in meta-analysis of random-ized controlled trials due to differences in the study design, inthe doses administered, in the products tested, in the productdelivery, in outcome assessment methods, or in the participantpopulation [141]. Additional critical issues include nonlinear dose response curves for many products and inter-and intra-individual differ- ences in bioavailability and other responses to PFSs and their constituents [142]. Consumers are inundated by flyers, pamphlets, and books pro- moting specific herbs or products that are often laden withconsiderable hyperbole or exaggeration in the claims madefor anticipated benefit [134]. Vigilance Meaningful, functional, and effective adverse events reporting and post-marketing surveillance systems are absolutely crit-ical. Primarily reports and whatever data are received are re-corded, but often, follow-up investigations are necessary to es-tablish or eliminate linkage of the reported adverse effect tothe PFSs in question [134]. Potential acute toxicity remains a potentially serious risk in case of unregulated products. Given these challenges and scarce data on efficacy and safety of PFSs, the overall usefulness of PFSs may be put into question.However, it has to be taken into consideration, that in times of de-clining licensing of herbal medicines in Europe because of regula-tory constraints and the dietary supplement status of herbal prod-ucts in the United States, PFSs often represent the only way to en-able the consumer access to promising herbal products. Exemplary Herbs of Encouraging Benefits An example is frankincense, which is experiencing a continuousincrease in sales due to its anti-inflammatory properties in timesof growing prevalence of symptoms like joint pain in a progres-sively aging Western population [143,144]. In fact, it was shownthat a number of pivotal enzymes in inflammation like 5-LO, ca- thepsin G, and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 as well as NF-B and several cytokines like TNF- ,I L - 1 , and IL-6 are inhib- ited by BAs, the ingredients of Boswellia serrata Roxb. ex Colebr. [143]. Moreover, the reputation of BAs as potentialpharmaceutical candidates found support in numerous studies[145]. A search in the frame of the EC-funded PlantLIBRA projectretrieved six human studies reporting positive effects of B. serrata on several biomarkers studies with no observed benefit for eryth-rocyte sedimentation rate and leukocyte count. Moreover, posi-tive results on hard endpoints like pain, ulceration, and disabilityscore were reported in nine human studies versus two studieswithout benefits on joint score and knee circumference. Ofcourse, the studies carried out so far with B. serrata are insuffi- cient, and there are many drawbacks hampering the assessment of the beneficial health effect like insufficient characterization ofthe Boswellia extract administered and heterogeneity in dosing and time of exposure between the studies as well as small samplesize and incomplete reporting of data. However, all outcomessupport the positive effects of B. serrata [146]. This is in agree- ment with the outcome of a previous review on all randomizedclinical trials with B. serrata extracts, suggesting that the evidence for the effectiveness is encouraging [147]. Other promising PFSs are those containing curcuminoids or curcumin that are considered the active principles of the golden spice turmeric ( C. longa ). Extensive research over the past half- century has shown that curcumin (diferuloylmethane) can modu-late numerous signaling molecules such as alanine in human participants. The clinical trials con- ducted thus far have indicated promising effects of curcumin inpatients with various pro-inflammatory diseases including arthri-tis, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, just tomention a few. Also, the beneficial effect of curcumin in improv-ing lipid profiles in patients with acute coronary syndrome, as wellas its protective action against hepatic conditions and alcohol in-toxication, has been demonstrated. Common to all these studies have been the safety, tolerability, and nontoxicity of this polyphe- nol, even at doses up to 12 g/d. However, poor bioavailability wasrevealed to be a major limitation to the therapeutic efficacy [ 148]. Hence, various formulations of curcumin have been developed forPFSs, including nanoscaled micellar formulations that have re-sulted in enhanced bioavailability combined with better therapeu-tic activity [149]. Last but not l east, the FDA has approved curcu- min as being generally recognized as safe. Meanwhile, it is being used as a supplement in several countries, often in combination with Boswellia [148]. Based on these findings, it may seem that curcumin s clinical efficacy is too good to be true. Nevertheless, the pharmaceutical industry remains reluctant in carrying out fur-ther clinical studies essentially needed to provide a deeper under-standing of curcumin s therapeutic potential that might help plac- ing this molecule at the forefront of novel therapeutics. The main reason for this reluctance on the part of the pharma- ceutical industry is the strict regulation environment for the regis- tration of HMPs, which, on the one side, results in a high level ofconsumer protection but, on the other side, represents major bur-dens for applicants often connected with high costs in times of arapidly growing competition with the supplement sector. As longas this regulation environment remains unchanged, the tendencyremains and will even increase to position the majority of poten-tial phytoactive principles in the food area as PFSs or other regis- tration tracks [4,8,150]. Consequently, many promising and readily available PFSs will re-main under-investigated, never finding their way in being ac-knowledged as medicinal products. 384Abdel-Tawab M.

PFSs Caught in the Trap between Diet and Drugs From the analysis in the present paper, it is clear that, on the one side, the current regulatory and legal situation in the EU is still faraway from harmonization that would make it possible for all Euro-pean citizens to benefit from traditional medicinal products and food supplements under, if not identical, at least comparable con- ditions [10]. On the other side, most of the problems associatedwith the use of traditional and herbal medicines arise mainly fromshifting these products as PFSs into the food sector. Although it isa general obligation of EU food law that all foods placed on themarket are safe, there is no harmonized requirements for foodscontaining botanicals to comply with specific safety and qualitystandards (e.g., GMP) as it is common practice for THMPs or bo- tanical dietary supplements in the United States. Adhering to the food law that is not as strictly regulated as the drug law, whichcontains additional regulatory provisions for protection of theconsumer s health, PFSs are not subject to a strict pre-market and post-market control. As such, evidence of quality, efficacy,and safety of these PFSs is not required before marketing and noproper vigilance is carried out after marketing. In fact, herbs and similar nutritional substances are consumed differently from conventional food and are not authentic supple- ments like multivitamins or minerals that have nutritional value.Being composed of phytoactive principles extracted from herbsthat are concentrated and administered in a suitable pharmaceu-tical form such as tablets or capsules, they are rather used world-wide in daily practice as medicine. In reality, however, they repre-sent an intermediate stage between diet and drugs. From a per-sonal point of view, there is hence an urgent need for modifying the regulatory framework for PFSs enabling a more stringent con- trol of product s quality and safety, which in turn should also ulti- mately result in more evidence-based uses. Insofar a new class ofregulation requirements being facilitated compared to HMPs butmore strictly regulated compared to PFSs may be defined andqualified for these intermediate stage products in order to com-pensate for the lack of regulation in this area. These regulationsshould focus on providing the consumer with high-quality PFSs and accurate and transparent information about the contents, ef- ficacy, and safety of PFSs. However, despite calls for change from many quarters, includ- ing industry, there has been little progress in the regulation ofherbal supplements. This is in part because the perspective andinterests of various parties are in direct conflict; whereas somemanufacturers support a weakening of standards, medical profes-sional groups would like to see them strengthened [26]. Nonethe- less, the consumer has the right to obtain and the industry has an unquestionable responsibility to provide consumers with truthful,meaningful, understandable, and not misleading informationabout PFSs. Proposals for immediate and long-term actions Of course, there are a lot of reputable PFS companies, but the con-sumer is unable to cope with the different qualities of PFSs on the market. In addition, misleading products of poor quality undercutlegitimate manufacturers and distributors who painstakingly pro- vide high-quality products. Based on that background, the utmostpriority should be to furnish the general public including health-care professionals with adequate information to facilitate betterunderstanding of the benefits and risks associated with the useof these products and to ensure that all PFSs are safe and of suit-able quality. Therefore, in terms of the consumer sh e a l t ha n ds a f e t y ,t h e following immediate actions, proposed previously by Kapoor and Sharfstein and strongly supported by the author, should be man-datory [26]:Implementation of standard manufacturing procedures for PFSs accompanied by standardized laboratory techniques forquality control. Truthful, not misleading, labeling providing an accurate list of all ingredients. Stronger disclaimers on the outer package clearly highlighting that PFSs are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or preventany disease and pointing to the consumer missing scientificevidence for propagated effects using declarations like \"this statement has not been evaluated by the regulatory author-ity\". Inclusion of a detailed, approved leaflet in each package. Strengthened surveillance of potential adverse effects. By this way, the public might be able to expect full disclosure of key safety information when purchasing a PFS. In addition, froma personnel point of view, the following aspects should be consid-ered at a minimum on the longer run in terms of quality, safety,and efficacy as well as vigilance. Quality In response to concerns regarding quality assurance, the FDA re-cently instituted the requirement that, in the United States, bo-tanical dietary supplements be prepared using GMP [135]. Similarto the United States, the industry of PFSs in Europe should also im-plement and adhere to GMP. This is necessary because the finalquality of the product on the shelf is dependent on the quality ofraw material and the quality of the extraction, formulation, andmanufacturing process. Also, the safety and benefits of a product are directly related to its quality. In view of the fact that an analy- sis screening for all undeclared pharmaceutical compounds can-not be easily performed because of the large number of pharma-ceuticals and novel analogues, quality-control standards must bedefined for dietary supplements made from plant sources to en-sure and verify the content and consistency of products. This inturn precludes the development of standardized validated analyt-ical methods. Compendial standards may serve as appropriate ref- erences for conducting tests or examinations. Therefore, when- ever possible, quality control should be performed according topharmacopoeial monographs like the Dietary Supplements Com-pendium or the Herbal Compendium in the USP that establishesstandards for the identity, strength, quality, and purity of herbalproducts. The current revision of the USP NF includes almost 500 monographs for dietary supplement ingredients and finished die-tary supplements. They may be referred to as specifications agreed in contractual agreements between buyers and sellers in 385Abdel-Tawab M. Do We Need ...Planta Med 2018; 84: 372 -393 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. international trade and serve as uniform points of reference for regulators and manufacturers, thus promoting consumer confi-dence [95]. Another measure of the quality of finished goods thatshould be considered is whether the product breaks down, dis-solves, and is bioavailable after oral ingestion. Hence, PFS manu-facturers must also test their formulations for disintegration anddissolution prior to marketing. Moreover, any anticipated changes of extraction or cleanup procedures must be made only with due consideration of the fact that these changes may significantly alter the content of a prepa-ration and may obviate reliance on any history of the botanical s safe use because of different levels of physiologically active ingre-dients. Hence, the safety and benefit of new preparations, if sig-nificantly different from established preparations, should be veri-fied by appropriate testing. In summary, PFS manufacturers should pay close attention to the following: Good agricultural practice for cultivated herbs in order to re- duce the risk of contamination by pesticides, heavy metals etc. Implementation of GMP from the moment the ingredients are harvested from the ground in order to reduce the likelihood ofcontaminants like pesticides or heavy metals to the minimum. Accurate identification and authentication of the starting ma- terial by their scientific names (latin binomial) in the form of voucher specimen in order to ensure chemical uniformity. This is important because common names are inadequate andoften refer to more than one species. Verification of identity, integrity, and homogeneity of any PFS raw material supply, whether fresh, dried, or ground powderusing taxonomic, chemotaxonomic, macroscopic, organolep-tic, microscopic, and/or chromatographic analysis Implementation of quality-control measures ensuring the cor- rect levels of active and/or marker compounds in the raw ma-terial/extract and the absence of unacceptable or unlawful lev-els of pesticides, heavy metals, and contaminants using stan-dardized reliable, rugged, reproducible, and validated methodsprior to formulation of the PFS. Further, the plant material orextract must be checked for the absence of adulterant plantspecies. DNA techniques complemented with other orthogo- nal techniques may be powerful tools for authentication of plant material at the early stages of processing. It is also advis-able to use several screening techniques to maximize the po-tential for adulteration detection, because no single methodol-ogy is universally applicable as described in the General Chap-ter <2251> Adulteration of Dietary Supplements with Drugsand Drug Analogs in the USP. Use of pharmaceutical-grade or standardized herbal material. Implementation of quality-control measures ensuring homo- genous composition of formulation batches and dosage formsthrough entire manufacturing runs and between runs in orderto ensure consistency and proper quantity of content in theproduct reaching the consumer. Inclusion of a shelf life stability testing program for finished products. Ensuring good practice along the entire supply chain that should be verified by repeated vendor audits, as supply chaintransparency when properly documented provides stringent quality assurance at each link of the supply chain. Implementation of a PFS adulteration database based on the incidences of PFS adulterations to provide an easily searchablepublic database of the risks of adulteration and the availabledetection methods. As not all PFSs represent the same quality, the establishment of a voluntary third-party verification program may represent a powerful tool to demonstrate the quality of a product. Like theUSP dietary supplement verification service, such a voluntarythird-party verification program should include an on-site facilityaudit for compliance with GMP, a thorough review of manufactur-ing and quality-control product documentation, comprehensivelaboratory testing for conformance to dietary supplement stan-dards found in the USP NF, continuous change control monitor- ing, and off-the-shelf surveillance testing of randomly selected samples of products to confirm that USP-verified products contin-ue to meet the USP s stringent standards [95]. High-quality PFSs meeting the stringent requirements of the verification processcould be provided with a quality seal similar to the USP seal givento dietary supplements in the United States that have been prov-en to:contain the ingredients listed on the label in the declared po- tency and amount not contain harmful levels of specified contaminants break down and release into the body within a specified amount of time have been manufactured according to GMP Such third-party verification can thus add another level of security and can help the consumer distinguish between high- and low- quality products. Besides improving quality and consistency of its products, the PFS industry should also invest in research and in developing astronger foundation of credible data to support its products.Hence, studies on PFSs as single or combined phytocomplexes,as well as the need for assessing their mechanism of action, arevery much needed. At the same time, there is a need of clinicaldata substantiating any health-related claim. This aspect and the evaluation of safety, possible unwanted side effects, and possible interactions with prescriptions drugs or with food should becomea major issue. The EC-funded project PlantLIBRA, which aims tofoster the safe use of food supplements containing botanicals ortheir preparations by evaluating the quality and health benefits ofPFSs and by increasing science-based decisions by regulators andfood-chain operators, marks a first step in the right direction. Efficacy If not yet realized, clinical trials using PFSs should be supported byrigorous preclinical data on molecular mechanisms and betterdata on safety, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism in both healthyand, where appropriate, more application-relevant human popu-lations. The mechanistic data should include strong evidence pin-pointing the key bioactive components and the critical moleculartargets in the organism [151]. Of course, the most critical element will be to define specific standards for PFSs to ensure consistency 386Abdel-Tawab M. Do We Need ...Planta Med 2018; 84: 372 -393Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. between studies. As it might be difficult to identify the active con- stituents in a complex mixture, a comprehensive characterizationis particularly important in case of complex mixtures, where iden-tities of the bioactive components and their mechanism of actionare not fully understood. In this case, considering a well-charac-terized mixture in toto instead of isolated compounds might rep- resent the shortest road to success. In any case, however, a properselection of the formulation and dosage as well as careful identifi- cation and control of significant variables is indispensable in terms of the so much needed better design of clinical trials. In order to deal with the backlog of several thousand of herbal products that have limited evidence of safety and efficacy, morefunding should be provided for more studies focusing on the effi-cacy and safety of herbs, not vitamins and minerals that haveoften established efficacy. It is also advisable to make use of mod-ern techniques like the Internet to recruit subjects for clinical studies faster [13]. Hence, in a recent study conducted entirely of the Internet, investigators were able to recruit and enroll 391patients in just one week [152]. As PFS manufacturers do not have the resources to conduct these costly studies needed to secure approval of a claim, someform of patent protection should exist so that manufacturerswho invest in expensive studies and document the efficacy oftheir products could be rewarded financially. This approach might leverage large research investments for PFS manufacturers. Based on the background that consumers do not make the an- ticipated distinction between substantiated and non-substanti-ated health claims, it might be helpful to create online efficacy ta-bles monitored and evaluated by expert scientists to facilitate forthe consumer the grading of a certain PFSs. Safety Altogether, it is clear, that \"natural \"does not equal \"safe \"and that PFSs may contain compounds of concern at levels far above thosefound in the regular diet. On top of this comes the fact that the TUof a PFS compound as a herb or tea does not guarantee its safetywhen used as a supplement. Nevertheless, a formalized frame-work for the safety assessment of PFSs is not in place yet, andsafety assessments are performed rather on a national and ad hocbasis or by dedicated bodies like, for example, the EMA. The latter, however, judges the safety of medicinal preparations and does not refer to the safety of PFSs in the field of food use. Be-sides, even when regulatory measures are in place, PFSs contain-ing compounds of concern may still be offered for sale on the In-ternet [78]. Therefore, given the expanding market of PFSs, clear criteria for control and safety assessment of PFSs should be establishedand prohibited, and restricted herbs should be clearly defined. This might include, where justified, mandating safety tests similar to those required for over-the-counter drugs including the Amestest, 90-day feeding studies during which the animal receives veryhigh doses of the supplement, a two-generation feeding studythat determines if the supplement is likely to have adverse effectson the next generation of the animal ingesting the product, andlong-term studies lasting more than two years. On the otherhand, botanicals or botanical preparations for which an adequate body of knowledge exists could benefit from a \"presumption ofsafety \"without any need for further testing as proposed by the EFSA guidance on safety assessment of botanicals and botanicalpreparations [51]. For food supplements consisting of complexmixtures of different botanicals, safety assessment could be car-ried out on the levels of individual substances of concern knownto be present, taking into consideration the limitation that suchan approach does not generally allow the assessment of possiblesynergistic or antagonistic effects. Any data on possible herb-drug interaction should be also carefully considered [51]. Vigilance There is a great need for more careful vigilance to identify, clarify, and elaborate any unwanted side effects or important PFS-druginteractions. Therefore, the establishment of an industry indepen-dent vigilance system should be given top priority, ensuring thatdata are reported comprehensively and transparently. Hence, following the example of the United States, supple- ment manufacturers should be urged to report, including infor-mation about the reporter, the injured party, the product, the ad-verse event, and the manufacturer of the PFS, serious adverseevents like death, life-threatening experiences, in-patient hospi-talization, persistent or significant disability, congenital anoma-lies, and medical or surgical interventions to prevent an adverseoutcome within 15 business days [18]. This information should be collected in suitable databases that are digitally intercon- nected in order to be able to process large amounts of global dataquickly. In addition, all serious adverse effects of a supplementshould be listed on a website so that consumers can have imme-diate access to this information. Moreover, consumers should be encouraged to tell their health-care professionals about the use of PFSs, and practitionersshould consider initiating such discussions. However, all these measures do not take away from the necessity for accurate and complete written information about precautions, interactions,and side effects to be provided to consumers when buying PFSs. Last but not least, significant consequences s hould be levied against manufacturers whose supplements are misbranded oradulterated so that manufacturers are motivated to follow astricter regulatory system as such described above. Proposal for a new regulatory framework In the end, there is no scientific basis for calling herbals supple-ments. Being non-vitamin, non-mineral ingredients, PFSs are nei-ther food nor drugs. Therefore, from a personnel point of view,they should be liberated from either designation and assigned aseparate regulatory category. Such a new regulatory category,which might be called \"phytoceuticals \",\"botaceuticals \",o r \"her- baceuticals \", should be restricted to herbal substances and prod- ucts thereof that are not considered an essential or conditionally essential nutrient in the human diet but are believed to have ben-eficial effects on health. These beneficial health effects may bebased on promoting human health by way of amplifying specifi-cally relevant bodily functions through their ability to mimic natu-ral human related biochemical substances or preventing the onsetof pathologic conditions, which in turn helps to avoid or delay theneed to use pharmaceuticals. Also, THMPs might be assigned to this new category, as from a legal point of view the plausibility of 387Abdel-Tawab M. Do We Need ...Planta Med 2018; 84: 372 -393 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. TU associated with THMPs alone may be insufficient to support a certain pharmacological effect. Hence, the actually availableTHMPs are in fact not medicinal products by function but by pre- sentation only [8]. This suggested new product category could be also implemented in the United States if the DSHEA is reformedaccordingly, restricting the definition of dietary ingredients tovitamins and minerals intended to supplement the diet. In deviation from the current situation for PFSs, this new regu- latory product category, which is referred to in the following forsimplicity reason as \"phytoceuticals \", should undergo a pre-mar- keting review and approval process, whereby manufacturers have to submit safety and effectiveness data. Ideally, the review and approval process should be carried out by a specially designatedscientific commission set up of experts in this field for this pur-pose, and the fees should be sufficiently low compared to drugauthorization. Evaluations of scientific evidences for any claimed health bene- fits for \"phytoceuticals \"should pr eferably proceed according to an evidence-based review process as described by the FDA, which is already increasingly applied for the evaluation of the strength of scientific evidence for nutrition-related topics [153]. An exempla-rily overview how to filter out non-qualified studies following suchan evidence-based review process is demonstrated in Fig. 1 [154]. By this way, the totality of scientific evidence is only derived from qualified studies suitable for scientific conclusions to bedrawn, thus ensuring an objective, transparent, and rigorous pro- cess for evaluating scientific evidence. Moreover, periodic tests should be initiated by this commission to ensure the contents match those listed on the label. While suchstricter regulations would surely help the safety of PFSs, additionalefforts are needed, as mentioned above, to improve and promotehigh-quality research. Therefore, this commission should prefera-bly also develop programs specifically addressed to encouragewell-designed clinical research in this new area. A similar ap- proach is already pursued in the United States in the form of the Office of Dietary Supplements established at the NIH, the missionof which is to strengthen knowledge and understanding of dietarysupplements by evaluating scientific information, stimulating andsupporting research, disseminating research results, and educat-ing the public [155]. The realization of a comparable perspectiveplan in Europe could thus trigger new insights in the field of \"phy- toceuticals \", a new product category, acting beyond the diet and before drugs and encouraging the use of proactive medicine toprevent better than to cure pathological conditions arising from wrong diet and lifestyle. The above-mentioned possible measures may help protecting public health by ensuring safe PFSs of suitable quality. Until, how- ever, the above proposed modifications in handling of PFSs areimplemented in total or in part, the consumer is still spoilt forchoice of the right PFSs. Hence, the questions arise for the con-sumer how to judge on the great variety of PFSs available on themarket and how to distinguish between high- and low-qualityproducts, especially as the number of well-researched, high-qual-ity products on the market continues to grow! What is a Good PFS? A trustworthy PFS should have a short ingredient list to ensure theingredients have the chance to be present in physiologically rele-vant amounts. This is important because supplement manufac-turers are namely required to list ingredients in order of fractionalcontent -that is, the first listed ingredient is present in the highest amount. Furthermore, providing voluntary chemical composition data may help to demonstrate that the manufacturer has at-tempted quality control. Package claims referencing reliablepeer-reviewed journal articles can be another marker of quality[156]. Last but not least, the principle applies \"hands off of PFSs that sound too good to be true \",a st h e yi nf a c tp r o b a b l ya r e . Conclusion The use of PFSs has grown steadily over the last 20 years despite incomplete information regarding active constituents, mecha-nisms of action, efficacy, and safety. Hence, PFSs have becomean integral part of health management, which may be attributedto the current consumer perception that \"natural is good \",t h e greater costs of many HMPs, the insistent marketing campaign,and the increasing perception of the need of a healthy diet. How- ever, lack of product quality and the adulteration of PFSs, espe- cially those sold via the Internet remain a question of concern. Fur-thermore, safety issues such as possible PFS-drug interactions re-main unaddressed for most PFSs, and only few rigorously de-signed clinical trials have shown efficacy. Assigning PFSs a new regulatory category in between drugs and diet can help protecting the consumer s right, and enforcing the industry to provide high-quality, effective, and safe PFSs with truthful not misleading labels. Such newly regulated \"phytoceuti- Fig. 1 Exemplarily overview for filtering out not qualified studies following an evidence-based review process proposed by the FDA [154]. 388Abdel-Tawab M.
