It can accurately diagnose physical, mental and emotional imbalances as well as diseases. It is a non- invasive science that enables to reach the root cause of health issues and not just address the symptoms. Nadi Pariksha understands the vibratory frequency of the pulse at various levels on the Radial artery. Subtle vibrations are read at seven different levels vertically downward that help in ascertaining various functions in the body. The pulse, when examined, reveals both physical & mental characteristics of the patient. This is interpreted in the form of symptoms along with their prognosis, which helps in understanding the cause. Thus, Nadi Pariksha forms the basis for addressing any ailment in an individual. Additionally, it is also the scientific tool that enables an individual to secure their personalized wellness regimes that range from therapeutic massages, personalized diet, exercise programmes, rigorous detoxification and lifestyle [transforming experiences](https://www.artofliving.org/in-en/projects/stories-of-change). The time tested and age-old natural way of healing, [Ayurveda](https://www.artofliving.org/in-en/ayurveda), has taught that any presence of disease in our system will be indicated as an imbalance in our 'doshas'. The key to cure and keep our body in good health is to [balance the doshas ](https://www.artofliving.org/in-en/ayurveda/what-is-ayurveda/dosha-imbalance)and bring back balance to the body system. The principles of Ayurveda follow the natural way to diagnose diseases and bring back balance to the body. Pulse diagnosis was initially identified in the books of Sharangdhar Samhita in the 13th century highlighting the correlation between Nadi and Tridosha. Later, in the 16th century it was again mentioned in 'Bhavprakash' scripted by Shri Bhav Mishrji. However, Nadi Pariksha gained its significance during the 17th century in Yogratnakar through 48 shlokas, detailing the science of Nadi. The scripture highlights details such as the appropriate time for Nadi Pariksha, rules for the Vaidya or Ayurvedic physician as well as the patient and also the rules to be followed before and after Nadi Pariksha. Along with the aforesaid scriptures, many other intellectuals, vaidya and saints did work on the science of Nadi; these include Maharishi Kanada, Ravanakrit Nadi Vigyan etc. At [Sri Sri Ayurveda Panchakarma](https://www.artofliving.org/in-en/ayurveda/sri-sri-ayurveda-panchakarma), our doctors are highly experienced and their lifestyle at the Art of Living Foundation includes regular practice of yoga, meditation, pranayama and the all [powerful Sudarshan Kriya](https://www.artofliving.org/in-en/sudarshan-kriya). This makes them deeply intuitive, highly focused and aware. Based on the Nadi Pariksha diagnosis, our doctors recommend personalized treatment and therapeutic plans. They also recommend the best suitable diet and lifestyle for you. Key Considerations for Accurate Diagnosis Best time for examining the pulse It is clearly mentioned by all the rishis and vaidyas that the pulsation of pulse varies from time to time and day to day. Kapha pulse is predominant in morning time, [pitta dosha](https://www.artofliving.org/in-en/ayurveda/ayurvedic-treatments/pitta-imbalance-manage) is predominant during mid day and the vata pulse can be observed in late afternoon and evening. Modern sciences have not yet been able to explain the phenomenon of variation of pulse during different times. Ayurvedic science explains the phenomenon related to the planetary action and the effect of moon and sun that has a major control over the changing of rhythmicity of the pulse. Critical rule to adhere prior to pulse diagnosis For precise diagnosis, it is recommended that the diagnosis be done on empty stomach, early in the morning or three hours after food. The reason behind this principle is because, after food metabolism process begins, the diagnosis process gets distorted. Examine the patient as a whole A physician must be aware about the physical condition of the patient and must be very attentive to note the general conduct and habits of the patient, facial expression, the reaction toward the climatic conditions, appetite, strength, nature of sleep, breathing pattern, history of ailments and so on. All these facts should also be discussed by the patient so as to confirm the diagnosis made through pulse. Method of examining the pulse The hand of the patient should be free and slightly flexed at the forearm, so that the left hand of the physician, the 3 fingers of the right hand, namely the index finger, the middle finger and the ring finger of the physician gently touches the skin over the radial artery. The index finger is comfortably placed nearest the thumb and the other two fingers are placed next to it (the thumb should not be extended too far nor too much fixed). Usage of three fingers in examining the pulse It has been observed that it becomes much easier to evaluate a pulse of a person with three fingers than by one. It has been now converted into a rule that vata is established by the tip of the index finger of right-hand, placed on the radial artery next to the root of the thumb of the right hand of the patient, pitta pulse studied by the touch of the tip of middle finger placed next to it and that the kapha pulse by touch of the tip of the ring finger placed next to the middle finger on the artery. Ayurveda supports health without disturbing the natural intelligence of the body. [Ayurvedic treatments ](https://www.artofliving.org/in-en/ayurveda/therapies/ayurvedic-body-purification-therapies)and techniques have no side effects. As a result, people around the world are now turning towards this ancient science to help them restore and maintain optimal health. "}
