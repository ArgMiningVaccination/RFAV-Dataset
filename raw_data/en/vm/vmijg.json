[Make a Reservation](/wiki/User_talk:DuceMoosolini)01:50, 2 April 2021 (UTC) i think the general gist is how fitness culture over the years has changed according to the needs of society. the article gives the example of the new deal era as comparison where fitness ideals were about being fit and healthy enough to handle arduous labour in work programes - fitness for the greater good sold with images of solidarity. thats kind of what 'fit' used to mean - it meant you were fit to serve. fitness as whole we see it today is a product of post industrial society. previous to this it was the reserve of nobility, particularly nobility forming a warrior class. the peasants breaking their backs in the fields didnt need to go for a jog to keep the weight off. the victorians however were much disappointed to general fitness of the enlisted men. its true that sandow and others pioneered modern fitness but this was by no means the obssession it is today. thats when science started to be applied to health and fitness, but it took a while for that become mainstream. the 70s is suggested in the article for the current fitness culture to really take hold and explode. tha sounds about right to me. thats about the time the fitness industry really started to boom and become the beast it is today. the likes of charles atlas and steve reeves laid the ground work, but the 70s was the pumping iron era that brought the world swarzenegger. and now we have youtube fitness and instagram selling programes and supplements and a lifestyle. the argument made is that currently the fitness industry is not selling fitness but body image. body building is about being strong or fast, its about the aesthetic. cars and houses and conspicuous wealth arent enough to show ones worth and success. you need the body too for the complete package, for your branding, to tell the world of your dedication and mastery of every part of your life. this is fitness not to serve as in previous eras but for self promotion. obesity conversely is an affront to the all of this. anything less that perfection indicates you are not maximising your time, not making the full effort in all parts of your life, shows weakness, sloth, it shows failure. the article i might add, is a just a interview to sell a book. stats and methodology and any actual detail should be found within the book expect. criticism should probably be based on that and not the promo.

One of the most toxic things about US culture is the pervasive belief that the degenerative diseases of old age are All Your Fault for Not Living Right. If you'd spent extra for organic, did more jogging, or ate more kale and fewer Big Macs you wouldn't have caught heart disease or cancer, or so the story goes. But the right regimen will confer prolonged youth. And like everything else, it costs money. Diet and exercise are worthwhile proxies for your willingness to suffer for conformity. They are one of the latest vessels into which the old problem, the puritan mind, has poured itself; health is today what money used to be, an outward sign that you are one of God's elect. The whole 'personal responsibility' mummery is allied with meritocratic thinking, and as such at least broadly consistent with 'neo-liberalism' in its fuzziest definitions.

[Comrade GC](/wiki/User:GrammarCommie) [Ministry of Praise](/wiki/User_talk:GrammarCommie)17:25, 7 April 2021 (UTC) - Not always. It's not \"scientifically illiterate\" to believe that life begins at some point before birth, because it's a philosophical question. It is not a contradiction to oppose abortion but supports the death penalty, and claiming this is the case, ignores that the people on death row have been proven in a court of law to have done something particularly heinous. Nor is it philosophically inconsistent to oppose abortion but refuse to give food to a starving man, as there is a difference between letting someone die and actively killing them. What is a contradiction is refusing to give the homeless man food but making it illegal to pull the plug on a brain-dead coma patient. - Before modern medicine, the woman's life always was in danger from a pregnancy, and therefore abortion always was an issue of self defense. There still is the risk of injury and so forth even from \"healthy\" pregnancies, but the better we become with medicine, well, that argument gets weaker and weaker. If there's a 20% chance the person will kill me, I am probably justified in killing to defend myself. But what if that drops to .2%? There's a 1 in 100,000 chance that any random person is a murderer; is it self defense or defense of others to kill a random person because of the .001% chance they will murder someone else? - What is pseudo-philosophy is a lot of the pro-abortion side. Most start with the conclusion, \"abortion should be legal\", and work backwards to make it ethical. I'm pro-abortion, but I don't pretend that I don't believe that all lives are equally valuable. I view \"human\" as a matter of brain function; brain-dead is all-dead, as far as I'm concerned. In the case of fetuses, the brain itself doesn't develop until around 12 weeks, and the brain activity required for \"consciousness\" doesn't begin until around 24-25 weeks. So for me, abortion should definitely be allowed before 12 weeks (i.e., first trimester), it's really the next 12 weeks (second trimester) that it's questionable. It gets more and more \"wrong\" the longer you wait, but once it's third trimester then I don't have a problem with it being illegal except for life-or-limb cases.

But abortion is rarely debated in a sober manner, and you usually end up with a bunch of hotheaded talking heads yelling at each other. So I'm sort of over the \"debate\", to be honest. It's usually not honest. - If you look at surveys, I would \"generalize\" and say that the top two reasons women elect to get an abortion are: A) socioeconomic reasons; B) family planning. So it's pretty clear that there would be a helluv a lot less abortions if education and access to family planning tools was widespread, and socioeconomic issues were resolved. We aren't there yet. In fact, in the United States, the \"pro-life\" party tends to be actively against such things. Go figure. - Some articles have speculated that the [sex abuse scandal](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2018/5/27/18382873/abortion-vote-is-backlash-for-sex-abuse-scandals-say-irish-catholics)is why is now legal in Ireland. To be honest, considering the shit that [the Irish Catholic church did with \"illegitimate\" children in \"the good ol' days\"](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/28/world/europe/tuam-ireland-babies-children.html)(going along with all the other history of [child abuse cases there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_cases_in_Ireland)that spans to modern time), and you're like, shit, pro life my ass.

Utilitarianism requires neutrality across time, so even if the fetus isn't currently a conscious person, with all the associated moral standing and distinct capacities, there is good reason to believe that it can develop into such a person under the right conditions. Thus, from a utilitarian perspective, if the fetus can be kept alive after an abortion, it may be ethically required to do so. Compare the case of somebody in a coma who has a high chance of regaining consciousness. Obviously, this raises even more ethical questions, such as are related to the subsequent care of the child, but it is one of the more intriguing views I've encountered.

You could argue that even if the mother wants nothing to do with the child, under the medical scenario I put forward, then it becomes a charge of the state. A purely utilitarian standpoint has a hard time dealing with special obligations and relationships; admitting that they exist poses issues for the utility calculus. Many would say you should divert the trolley even if your own child is on the other track, and that your intuitions about this are simply wrong if you think you shouldn't do this. If separating the child from their birth mother is inherently objectionable, it might only be because we expect that they would be worse cared for, but this might only indicate that we are already not fulfilling our obligations to children and should do more. [Serene](/wiki/User:Serene)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Serene)) 18:50, 7 April 2021 (UTC) - I can also give a go at properly playing devils advocate. Although the fetus cannot live independently (in some cases, as late in pregnancy and increasingly early with modern medical care), it is alive, and like all living things therefore has a prima facie right to life. Also, the mother has a prima facie right to bodily autonomy, which stands in conflict with the fetus' right to life. Not that there is no need to attach personhood to the fetus; we imagine that, for instance, a cat is not a person, but it would nevertheless be prima facie wrong to kill one. In order for abortion to be justified, the mother's right to bodily autonomy must be all-things-considered greater than the fetal right to life. Now, it is important to clarify what a right to life refers to. It is not a right to have others give their life to protect your own: nobody is obligated to kill themselves to save another. A doctor would be wrong to kill a patient in order to donate their organs to other people: this we take as obvious. The right to life is a negative right: you must not interfere with my ability to live. Consequently, if the pregnancy poses a threat to the life of the mother, we cannot object to abortion: the fetal right to life is not a right to the death of the mother. A comparable argument could be used for the case of rape. This system is largely particularist, and so demands that each case be evaluated on its own merits. If the mother is healthy, is in a stable and healthy relationship, and can reasonably expect to remain in good economic standing even with a child, it becomes much more difficult to argue that she has an overriding interest that justifies the abortion, so long as the fetus dies as a side effect. Note that even though this is not a utilitarian system, we can again reach that conclusion that the right abortion does not equate to the right to guarantee the death of the fetus. If the fetus can be kept alive outside the mother's body, then its right to life no longer conflicts with the mother's right to bodily autonomy. Again, even if the mother refuses to raise it, it could perhaps be cared for by somebody else, and if this care is expected to be inadequate, that may simply reflect a societal failure to meet our ethical obligations. - As for what I actually believe, in the context of the United States, I think Roe v. Wade made a good decision in treating it as a medical issue rather than an ethical issue. Comparably weighty ethical decisions are made frequently without the government getting involved, and I see no justification for the special treatment. Furthermore, I am neither a strict utilitarian nor a believer in divine command theory. If a particular cutoff must be chosen, I would endorse something around the 22-23 week mark. This is just before brain activity indicative of consciousness begins, and having the cutoff slightly earlier ensures against even the most significant outliers becoming conscious before the abortion. It is also far enough into the pregnancy that I think it is reasonable to expect that the mother should be aware of the pregnancy by that point. I would also support later cutoffs for instances of threat to the mother's life, rape, and incest.

Let's call this \"case A\". Now you another island pop up, blocked off from the first island, that has some very poor people whose lives are only barely worth living, though there is little inequality on this island. Let's call this \"case A-\". Now some of the resources of the first island are magically transported to the second island, and so everyone is living an equally decent life, but not quite as high a quality of life as the first island in Case A. Let's call this \"Case B+\". Now, an isthmus forms between the two islands, and they are just 1 island, with no inequality, this will be Case B. Now let's repeat this process, all the way until Case Z, where there's a huge, overpopulated continent where people live lives slightly better than simply dying. In each step of the way, every case appears to be an improvement over the last, yet the resulting \"repugnant conclusion\" is that an overpopulated hellhole is a superior situation to a small island paradise. - Where is the flaw? Because that does describe the world we live in, and it's a huge question in both the immigration and abortion debate. We'd certainly be better off in the scenario where unwanted babies or refugees/illegal-immigrants/etc didn't exist, but they do exist, and it's not exactly moral to kill them even if it results in life being better for us.

I know I'm a minority for someone my age, but (short of criminal activity or similar) I absolutely do not care about what teams and athletes do outside of their sports; if I support something, it's because I agree with the cause and not some guy who's talented at a sport. And in this case they're actively hurting one of their own franchises, so it's the ultimate Plaxico Burress move.

Now here is what is interesting: when I initially fell I actually broke my foot and it never healed properly. The ER doctor told me that it was merely a sprain but that was not the case. So I have been walking on a broken foot that did not heal properly. That is why the X-Ray showed only a fracture. It gets better- I need an MRI to see if there was an Achilles Tendon rupture. If there was a rupture I will need surgery to fix the problem! How in the fuck did the ER doctor miss a broken foot (which he hit into while he walked and did not apologize)?

I have said this before, the lady has Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. I am not being an asshole here, I am literally defending the lady. She regularly slurs her speech, she has an inhibited ability to understand causal relationships, like she doesn't get a joke is a joke. I have worked with a very sweet gentleman who exhibits all these traits. If you want to get physical, she's got a short nose and thin upper lip and doesn't quite get why she's having her picture taken while she's pretending to cut carrots. I absolutely have adult alcohol syndrome, but I am really worried we are piling on a girl who literally has reduced mental faculties here even if she doesn't present them in an easy to parse way. It happened at my work with a very sweet gentleman. He could talk and listen, but when you understood he could not reason, it was like \"ohhhh ok\" Lemme put it this way. I overheard the guy complaining that he had to clean bathrooms, and I was like \"well, here we go.\" He said \"And I know why they make me do it, too.\" and I was like \"Holy shit, he knows we think he's [the r slur].\" And he says \"It's because I do such a good job.\" We asked him to do closing duties, which included turning the lights off. Had a guy working late, sweetie turned the lights off. Guy turned the lights back on. Sweetie came around and turned the lights back off. Guy turned the lights on. Sweetheart, oh poor guy sweetheart that everybody really took seriously, said \"Who keeps turning these lights on!?!\" Then an argument happened, and sweetheart's defense was \"I am supposed to turn these lights off\" and the guy couldn't explain to him he was still working. Complained to me, I was like \"guy, are you stupid? Did you listen to sweetheart? He can't help it, he really literally can't figure out why you keep turning the lights back on.\" But if you talk to or interact with the sweetheart, without knowing it, he's just another guy, maybe a bit of a dummy. Which is fine and normal and you run into those people. But if you actually interact with sweetheart, you start to recognize, no, he's not just a dumb guy. There's a real deficit in faculty here. It's not the point that she can't cook right. The point is, she's seriously running on reduced faculties, and making her a lolcow is easy until you've met some people who are literally, just like, big children. They're just like really big kids.

This girl knows how I feel about relgion and I wouldn't let her go to this girl's church until she turned 16 last year and got her driver's license and really couldn't do much to stop her short of taking her keys away (I told the pastor there I did NOT want her to get baptized but he did it anyway, asshole), and she's been getting more and more religious since then. She said a while ago that she wants to go to college in Florida with her friend to study nursing, which I'd been slightly supportive of (thinking maybe the professors would talk some sense into them) until I found out she's wanting to go to this ultra Conservative Southern Baptist place called Pensacola Christian College (which you guys have an article on, which is how I found this site) where they don't let girls wear anything but skirts and they teach them young-earth creationism, and I really, really, really do not want her to go there, but I'm afraid if I tell her no she will go anyway and try to pay her own way because they advertise that a kid can go there and work to pay the tuition.

New converts are more zealous so the more you fight her on this, the more committed she will probably become as she may interpret this as \"persecution\" so it could make her even more committed to her religion. The vast majority of the courses she will take at that Christian college will be nursing courses or other nonideological courses. There is a big demand for nurses in the USA and the demand is expected to rise so she will have a secure future if she completes her studies. If you get her upset, this could cause her needless problems/distractions during the time she is studying nursing courses. Sometimes in life you have to pick your battles. This isn't a battle worth fighting. If you fight it, you may unnecessarily alienate your daughter and may cause her problems as far as her nursing studies. - At this point, your best bet is living an ethical life to the best of your ability.

So if you want to positively influence your daughter, I would do this at this juncture. Thank you for the responses. As far as me talking her out of religion, I don't think that's going to happen because she has an IQ of 140 and even though I completely disagree with all of her political and religious views (she likes Donald Trump too), I struggle to refute what she has to say not because she is right but because to be honest she is better with words than I am (she must get that from her dad's genes, which is a long story irrelevant to the situation). Besides that, she's pretty set in her ways. She's always trying to push that fundie stuff on me and trying to get me to read and watch bullshit from Ken Ham and Institute for Creation Research, and she gives out these things called \"Chick Tracts\" to all of her classmates and teachers and tries to get them to come to that fundie church with her and her friend, and she seems to think it's some great accomplishment that she and her friend got most of the other girls in their sports teams at school to get baptized all at once (I really, really hope it's a peer pressure thing where a few did it and the rest followed and weren't really serious about it rather than my offspring genuinely turning probably about 50-100 people into fundies). And don't even get me started with the school, they won't do ANYTHING to discourage this behavior because of \"free speech\" (I would expect this kind of shit out of the deep south, but not New England). But even though I disagree with all of this, I still love my daughter and don't would rather she not go to this place that has absolutely horrible reviews, apparently punishes rape victims, and appears from their website to be filled mostly with homeschoolers and backwoods knuckle draggers from schools in the Bible Belt, and was hoping for some pointers on how to dissuade it. I'm going to try to encourage her to consider Liberty or Cedarville (anyone have any ideas on how to approach someone like her with that?) but otherwise it looks like I'm stuck with accepting this. I guess I should be happy for her that she picked a good profession to pursue, but I just can't get behind this Pensacola place.

Does what she believes hold up to rational scrutiny? Don't try arguing with her, just try to set her on a path to self-examination. And, she has 140 IQ but wants to go into nursing?! Unless she wants to get a PhD in nursing, she'd be wasting her potential, and getting a fundie degree in nursing would make it difficult to get a doctorate in healthcare or science.

I'm almost certain she could get into Harvard or Yale and study medicine because she has a 4.0 GPA, but for whatever reason she's stuck on wanting to go to a fundie school. She's not overly open with me but I think it has to do with her being a girl and her thinking that nursing is a \"girly\" profession. She's said she wants to marry a missionary and go overseas to help people in developing countries, something like Doctors Without Borders from the sounds of it.

However, decades of intellectual poison have rendered them only able to blame liberals/communists/atheists for problems that they vote to continue over and over and over. So they find a way to make \"big corporations\" into somehow a liberal thing, because Bill Gates has neoliberal views, or make up the utterly batshit concept of \"corporate communism\" to explain why Amazon takes down right wing hell sites like parler that do things like allow advocating major crimes like assassination or terrorism without moderation. The inability to blame the system working as intended for problems it creates is an amazing victory for the right wing media empire.

I would imagine in Virtue ethics it would be considered immoral for the most part. Pointlessly having a picnic on a grave knowing it could hurt or disrupt people when there are numerous other places you could do it would not be a shining example of virtuous behaviour. For a deontological system, the only rule I could imagine the rule would be: not engaging in unnecessary hurtful behaviour when it is easily avoided. That of course is an extremely murky, grey and very relative law...which deontological systems try to avoid. With such a vague law...you could say you shouldn't \"draw cartoons of Mohammed\". I can envision many constructive reasons for doing that (as dubious as many would sound...not the least criticising bad ideas and asserting your freedom of expression when ideological forces try to silence it). But...I gasp at any such law that would challenge drawing cartoons. And yet I still think pointlessly having a picnic on a loved-person's grave can simply have no reasonable positive justifications. So...forget deontological. Utilitarian...would depend very much on the system. In its simplest, I'd say the good of respecting property rights (owner of the grave) and the dignity of the bereaving family outweighs any imaginable value of picnicking on the grave when there are countless other places to do it.

Most places its innocuous regular people making a living doing news and presumably the hard work of editing. But there's a certain flavor of site that brands itself as intellectual and worldly that seems to consistently get the same incestuous batch of hucksters again and again. And the tone is, again and again, trying to pitch some feverishly right wing things as sound liberalism. It's not just Pinker; he's just my most hated. In this case its also David French, Hadely Freeman, and Jonathan Haidt: serial propagandists of exactly the same sort. But it's always a grab bag of the same shitheads. I hesitate to toss Francis Fukuyama in my list, because while he's often part of these same boards, his publication history isn't as polluted with the right wing shilling. - Knowing you, and I apologize for this broad assumption, you think each of those people is a respectable writer, but they all have a long history of exactly the sort of duplicitous bullshit I mean. I can't stand that there seem to be institutional forces at work to give these scumbags repeated platforms. They come out of nowhere with huge(for media) payrolls, and it's always the 4-5 of the same dozen names. Always. The world has so many more educated, eloquent people out there.

European anti-burqa laws are absurd and abhorrent restrictions on personal freedom[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive386&action=edit\u00a7ion=43)] I don't know what dictionary y'all Euros are reading, but since when did taking away a woman's right to choose count as 'liberation'?. Whether or not a woman chooses to veil is solely her prerogative; any form of government interference in that matter is blatantly tyrannical. The Swiss banning the wearing of the burqa and naqib in public ain't any better than Islamic Iran forcing woman to veil in public (no I don't mean to argue that their punishments are equivalent; it's about the principle of it) [Comrade General Pootis](/wiki/User:Comrade_General_Pootis) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Comrade_General_Pootis)) 15:25, 15 April 2021 (UTC) - The anti-burqa laws don't exist because we believe that women are choosing to wear the burqa, but because we believe they are being coerced to wear the burqa.

Crosses and payots are common symbols of the respective religions you are talking about, as is the hijab. The burqa is not the hijab.

[Comrade GC](/wiki/User:GrammarCommie) [Ministry of Praise](/wiki/User_talk:GrammarCommie)19:00, 15 April 2021 (UTC) - That's simple; the inability to make fun of Islam/Mohammed without fearing for your life. - Humor is about many things, but it's largely a tool of disempowerment because the highest forms of humor involve something that is both absurd and true. Simple jokes will create a \"truth\", and then the punchline will reveal some absurdity in this truth. Good comedians won't tell jokes, but point out the absurdity in real life. This takes away the power \"holy\", unquestionable ideas have over us. This is useful because humans do and believe many absurd things, being able to question these things allows us to remove the useless or even harmful portions while strengthening the good portions, and banning humor is basically making it illegal to point out the absurdities. For example, you'll get more mileage out of singing \"every sperm is sacred\" than trying to reason with a pro-lifer. - When it comes to religion, the greatest promoter of Atheism has never been Richard Dawkins giving boring lectures on Atheism, but rather, Family Guy and other forms of entertainment exposing the absurdity of the whole thing, by making Jesus and God the butt of the joke so to speak. Imams watch what happened to Christianity and just how quickly in the past few decades we went from being Jesus-Freaks to even the general public becoming more or less a-religious. They want to make sure that no such thing can happen to Muslims, and so it becomes a capitol offence to even draw Mo, let alone make fun of the guy. As a result, Muslims aren't ever exposed to the absurdity of the story of Mo, and go further and further into the religion and become vulnerable to extremism.

Burqas are letterbox slit face and body covers. This means that if you wear a burqa, you are basically capable of going around without having any sort of identifiable thing about your person. Good luck finding someone in a burqa, where depending on the situation you may not even be able to visually identify the gender, eye color, skin color or even anything else that we usually use to determine a witness profile; most of us identify these things by the face of the person in question. It'd make solving supermarket theft horrible, because of how easy you'd make it for criminals to simply start wearing burqas to not be identified. Basically, my problem with them is the same reason you can't wear a bataclava in public. Head coverage I have no problem with on this end (and they shouldn't be banned) because they still leave the face visible, which helps you identify the person.

It was just a generic ban on \"face coverings\". In practice, if you'd only ban bataclavas, all you'd be doing is moving the goalposts for a criminal to use another item instead which would inevitably lead to the burqa since it's the other fairly easily available complete face covering item, so it's better to do it in one go. I do want to make clear though that I consider it only a good thing from a security perspective. From actually getting rid of fundamentalist Islam, it's not useful beyond [reactionary](/wiki/Reactionary)posturing, which is obviously not a good thing. In general, I'd agree with GCs comment below (aside from the first point since I have a different motivation than \"stopping fundamentalist Islam\" for not liking them) if you actually want to stop fundamentalist islam. Building bonds and communities is far stronger at stopping radicalization (but also is strong at encouraging it, hence why there should be an active effort to create them, because otherwise fundies will create those bonds instead of you) and should be the main focus.

[[13]](https://www.pewforum.org/2017/11/29/europes-growing-muslim-population/) - Historically, when Muslims have hit between 10-16% of a population there are incidents of lawnlessness as a form of protests (Car burnings, Paris) and this has happened in India, Israel, Russia, Kenya and Guyana. Any anti-Muslim actions that offends radical Islamacists will result in threats/uprisings (Amsterdam - Mohammed cartoons). - France has the largest Muslim population in Europe in terms of its percentage of Muslims. And France has a history of trying to impose secularism (head scarf bans) on its Muslim population and being very vigilent about protecting native French culture.

Germany will probably be the second country as right-wing populism is growing in Germany and Germany currently has about a 6 percent of its population Muslim population. But if it's not Germany that sees a big culture clash next, it may happen in the UK/Austria (6.1 and 6.9 percent Muslim populations respectively at the present time).

Covid-19 is eating up the clock in terms of Muslim-native European bridge building as people are not socializing as much. - Even if you're only trolling, most european countries has only 5% Muslims. This will remain, because there are many muslims moving away or leaving Islam. And the right isn't growing, - France has the largest Muslim population in Europe in terms of its percentage of Muslims. And France has a history of trying to impose secularism (head scarf bans) on its Muslim population and being very vigilent about protecting native French culture. With Marine Le Penn gathering steam, France is going to be the canary in mine when it comes to a culture clash between native Europeans and Muslim radicals. Germany will probably be the second country as right-wing populism is growing in Germany and Germany currently has about a 6 percent of its population Muslim population. But if it's not Germany that sees a big culture clash next, it may happen in the UK/Austria (6.1 and 6.9 percent Muslim populations respectively at the present time). Currently, Sweden has around a 8% Muslim population and Switzerland has around a 6% Muslim population, but it takes a lot to rile up Swedes and the Swiss. Advocates of globablism claim Trump's election defeat signals the end of right-wing populism, but that's wishful thinking. The USA badly handled the coronavirus pandemic and that killed Trump's electability in 2020.

The divine powers as well as the claim that it held stone tablets of the 10 commandments are most likely just myths that arose later on?

It contained the \"original\" Ten Commandments was carried around by the Israelites during their time in the wilderness and eventually ended up the the temple.

[Anna Livia](/wiki/User:Anna_Livia)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Anna_Livia)) 13:55, 18 April 2021 (UTC) - So I fail to see why my question is an onerous and unreasonable question. That is a bad anology. Surely there is a reason or reasons why China, which is a left of center government and whose communist leaders must be an atheist to be a member of the Chinese Communist Party, engaged in such behavior against feminists. Next, the article The Surprising Discovery About Those Colonialist, Proselytizing Missionaries published in Christianity Today notes about Protestant missionaries (not Catholic missionaries): - \"In his fifth year of graduate school, Woodberry created a statistical model that could test the connection between missionary work and the health of nations. He and a few research assistants spent two years coding data and refining their methods. They hoped to compute the lasting effect of missionaries, on average, worldwide... - One morning, in a windowless, dusty computer lab lit by fluorescent bulbs, Woodberry ran the first big test. After he finished prepping the statistical program on his computer, he clicked \"Enter\" and then leaned forward to read the results. - \"I was shocked,\" says Woodberry. \"It was like an atomic bomb. The impact of missions on global democracy was huge. I kept adding variables to the model\u2014factors that people had been studying and writing about for the past 40 years\u2014and they all got wiped out. It was amazing. I knew, then, I was on to something really important.\" - Woodberry already had historical proof that missionaries had educated women and the poor, promoted widespread printing, led nationalist movements that empowered ordinary citizens, and fueled other key elements of democracy. Now the statistics were backing it up: Missionaries weren't just part of the picture. They were central to it... - Areas where Protestant missionaries had a significant presence in the past are on average more economically developed today, with comparatively better health, lower infant mortality, lower corruption, greater literacy, higher educational attainment (especially for women), and more robust membership in nongovernmental associations. - In short: Want a blossoming democracy today? The solution is simple\u2014if you have a time machine: Send a 19th-century missionary.\" (bolding added for additional emphasis) [[28]](https://archive.is/cDMnA) So countries that are the freest and most democratic countries in the world and do not have oppressive governments have a Protestant cultural legacy. In addition, these countries have high educational development for women. Now are all countries that have an atheist cultural legacy the most free and less authoritarian countries in the world and a great place for women? Absolutely not! If you doubt this, go to China where over 1.3 billion people are under an oppressive government according Amnesty International, the BBC and other organizations. [[29]](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/china/report-china/) [[30]](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34592336) [[31]](https://time.com/4519160/china-xi-jinping-cecc-human-rights-rule-of-law/) Another key point: I would further point out, that if the USA (which has a Protestant cultural legacy) were a bad country, then the Biden administration wouldn't be having a border crisis now where people from all over the world (especially Latin America) are pouring into the USA as illegal immigrants. God bless America! And remember, biblical Christianity claims the first people to see the risen Christ were women, not men. In addition, Mother's Day, which is a wonderful day for many women and is now practiced in many parts of the world, was first practiced in the USA. [Krodasrap](/w/index.php?title=User:Krodasrap&action=edit&redlink=1) ( [talk](/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Krodasrap&action=edit&redlink=1)) 19:32, 18 April 2021 (UTC) - Comparing atheism and the religious is pointless. It is secularism that is of most value (and you can enjoy secularism if you are an atheist or religious). Secularism is meaningless if it is not accompanied by an open-democratic society. China is not a secular country in any meaningful sense. It is one that is intolerant of religion (in a similar way to non-secular Iran re: atheism). The benefits of being atheist are few if you are not in a tollerant-secular country. And they are even fewer if you aren't in a country with an open-democratic system. That is why comparisons of \"atheist\" countries and \"religious\" countries are meaningless. However when you take truly secular countries with a notable non-believing population with an open-democratic society you are far more likely to find happier, healthier, socially adjusted, tolerant, educated, wealthy people in a non-toxic, more generous and far more moral society. When you take away any of those three things (a notable non-believer population, true secularism and open-healthy-democracy) you will find less of the qualities I just mentioned above. Ken wants to make it an issue about atheism. It should be an issue about true-secularism and an open society.

I have a serious question when it comes to the Anarchist replacement for the police. The harsh reality is that whether society is structured the way it is right now or the hypothetical perfect Anarchist version, short of some sort of purge/genocide, the very same people that exist in today's society will exist in an Anarchist society. Most anarchists seem to be under the impression that a professional, trained police force could be replaced by some variation of community volunteers. The problem I have with this is, well, who volunteers for such things? Well, for starters, the same people that would volunteer to either be cops right now, or worse, the same people that are in the various \"community watch\" programs already in existence, you know, the ones rejected by the police forces of the country. For instance, George Zimmerman, the guy who mistook a teenage kid for a thief, got into a fight, and ending up killing a child who was otherwise minding his own business. This is pretty much the event that created the modern Black Lives Matter movement, even if it wasn't named such at the time. So then, my question is really, in what way would an anarchist-style law enforcement be meaningfully different from a community watch? What prevents these community watches from being staffed by the George Zimmerman's of the world?

Heck, that literally describes Genghis Khan's domestic policy in China; why plunder 1,000,000 bolts of silk when he could get 500,000 bolts every single year forever?

The literature about this kind of problem is very big, actually, it goes back not to Hobbes and Locke, but machiavelli, at least, he was one of the first to realize that a non state army doesn't stand a chance. I recommend [this one](https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_08_3_1_holcombe.pdf), too. As the name suggests, it was written by an Austrian, but it's still a good article, and like the other, it's not very big. There are also two of my favorite books, Anarchy State and Utopia by Harvard Philosopher Robert Nozick, if you want a more dense, abstract stuff, and The Narrow Corridor, by Daron Acemoglu (MIT economist) and Jim Robinson (University of Chicago Political Scientist), which is easier and more historical even if it can be boring some times. Both are great. Now I gave you the keys and I don't need to bother about that article anymore.

I'd also like to point out, however, that Anarchism does not mean there is no centralized administrative body. It can entail that, depending on the variant, but it can also not entail that. It actually rather depends on the group or figure. Let me put it this way, Anarchism is basically pure [Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy)taken to its logical endpoint. Its counter school of thought is [Republicanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism)which argues that a nation-state ought to exist to provide for the common good, and to ensure order and a lack of mob rule. Finally, I'd just like to point out that neither school of thought has survived in its pure form in practice thus far, at least not without some seriously fucked up shit occurring.

In other worlds, they believe that coercion, authority and (what anarchists probably hate the most) hierarchy are not only desirable to a certain point, but also inevitable.

Second, I will say I watched it dubbed in Russian, with Hindi subtitles, so I have no clue what was said. Third, I will admit a guy at work made the point that maybe that's exactly what saved the movie for me. Finally, I will admit to being smug about watching it before its US release and try not to spoil anything. I mean, it's based on Mortal Kombat, one of my least favorite fighting games, I might have just enjoyed finding it. But I do that kind of regularly, so I dunno, probably not it. It is one of the darkest movies I've ever seen. By which I mean, if you don't have high contrast and definition, you probably can't see anything. The director, if not also the director for videography, clearly has a boner for the idea of lighting half of a face, very cool lighting technique but like your entire movie? There's one specific moment where it's like \"Whoah, hold on, wait, where's the light coming from, why am I suddenly looking at the opposite half of this guy's face?\" The final fight is like, so extremely well done that I have to assume that was the budget, even if it takes place in like an unfinished Nth story of an office building. Like, that's the magic warp place the big bad lives in? Awesome fight choreography, I mean WOW and for the first time it's actually visible. If you wanted to have that fight, you probably should have made a completely different movie. But I enjoyed calling out beats and groaning about upcoming beats and seeing them play out exactly as I called them. If you have played Mortal Kombat, it's OK. It was hot garbage. Godzilla v Kong was cool garbage.

The discussion barely touches the data, and spends a lot of time talking about absolutely nothing. \"\"1. It could be difficult, if not impossible, to measure all the independent and confounding variables that are important in such research. - Oh you think? Man if only medical had faced a similar problem for centuries for all the complexities of the human body, and had devised some kind of system of randomized controls that allow us to examine the statistical effects of some specific intervention epidemiologically without necessarily having a fully reductive model of all possible interactions. Sadly, that has never come up before and the \"blind, placebo controlled randomized trial\" must only be the ideal of a philosopher. \"\"2. How might one define what is an acceptable response to prayer? Healing can be partial or complete. It can be psychological or physical. It can be abstract or concrete. Confounding the picture, statistically significant improvement can be identified only if the same outcome measure is improved in a sufficiently large number of experimental relative to control patients, but why should God decide to select any one outcome measure over the rest? And if different outcome measures improve in different experimental patients in response to prayer, there is no way in which the improvement can be statistically detected. - Surely, surely, we must consider killing the patient an equally good outcome to saving them. \"Saving lives\" has no business is a medical journal. What nonsense! Certainly the supposed beneficiaries of prayer never make specific claims about how their outcome was affected[sic]. Nope. - The whole thing is a frustrating Gish Gallop.

I Successfully Launched My First Javascript Incorporation Today[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive386&action=edit\u00a7ion=66)] First off, this is very small beans. Secondly, I assume it's a total hack job, I have never used Javascript before. My last coding experience was VisualBasic. But I'm proud of myself and I'm bustin. Last week I decided \"You know what, it's slow, I'm going to make my job easier when it's outrageously busy.\" I took a form that is usually hell to manually create but only comes up once every few months. And I used NitroPro (not sponsored, it bugged out when I didn't custom script and loaded it in Adobe), a PDF program, to create a bunch of text fields with the sole purpose of making it simple enough that if all the text fields are filled out, anyone can confidently do it without my help. Then I was like \"I wonder if I can automate the current date to just show up and be in non-American.\" You know, 20-APR-2021, non-American, that's what we call it. That's kind of a thing that trips up customs clearance once or twice a year, and I'd rather not try to teach that. So I looked it up, and there was javascript code, and I could custom code the text field to do that. So I said \"Shit, if I can code that, what else can I code in?\" So any quiet time I got, I started googling and tinkering, to create not just a form to fill out, but a form that does all the things I make mistakes on if I'm rushed or dumb. When new lines appear, license and tariff codes automatically populate, and cost/total cost automatically calculate. The trick was to get all that stuff to disappear if a line is removed. It's not done, but I finally made it practically functional yesterday, and I don't believe it either, but today I actually had to use it. I got an email from UPS requesting clearance info. It's kind of a common problem when we ship to US territories, principalities, military sites, etc. Our system treats it as domestic but it still needs the export documents. A new guy just shipped a box to Puerto Rico like it was normal, it should have had an international marking on it and it didn't, whatever, mistakes happen. Here's the status on the tracking number, and scribed by me \"04/20/2021 - 2:25 P.M. Louisville, KY, United States UPS initiated contact with the sender to obtain clearance information. Once received, UPS will submit for clearance. / The information requested has been obtained and the hold has been resolved.\" The form I pieced together auto populated date, total value per item at quantity, tariff codes, license codes and total cost for shipment.
