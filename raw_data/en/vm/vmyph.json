Difficulty in swallowing capsules is quite a common experience. Vitabiotics have researched this extensively and recommend after chewing some food (e.g. banana), just before you swallow, pop the capsule into your mouth and swallow it together with the chewed food, followed by some liquid. The throat opens up wider to swallow the chewed food and so the capsule should go down with greater ease. Alternatively, the capsules may be swallowed with thicker liquids such as yoghurts or smoothies How and when should Feroglobin Capsules be used? Feroglobin Capsules - One capsule daily is recommended with or immediately after your main meal, with water or a cold drink. Always ensure that Feroglobin Capsules are taken with plenty of liquid to help wash the capsule down, and not tea or coffee as this may cause the capsule to disintegrate too early. Taking the capsule with a large meal maximises the absorption of the nutrients. Feroglobin Capsules should only be taken on a full stomach. What Nutrients Are Included In Feroglobin Capsules?

It normally goes by the name of vitamin B12 however, it also has the name of cobalamin. The UK's Department of Health recommends that adults get 1.5g a day of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is measured in micrograms (\u00b5g). Of course, many experts believe there are times when higher levels of vitamin B can be beneficial. What Does Vitamin B12 Do? Vitamin B12 helps to release energy from food and also helps with normal energy release. Because of this, vitamin B12 is associated with the reduction of tiredness and fatigue. Vitamin B12, along with folic acid, contributes to normal homocysteine metabolism, an important factor in heart health. Vitamin B12 also contributes to the normal function of the immune system and helps to support the nervous system. It contributes to normal psychological function too. Some Nutrient Reference Value (NRV) levels are above 100%. Is this safe? Certain vitamins are very safe at levels tens or even hundreds of times the NRV, whereas for others the safety level is much closer to the NRV. For this reason every vitamin and mineral needs to considered on an individual basis in terms of its upper safe level. The Nutrient Reference Value (NRV) is the amount of a vitamin or mineral which has been calculated to help prevent basic deficiency states in the general population. However, certain vitamins and minerals at optimal levels, above the NRV, have consistently been shown to have positive benefits in specific areas of health. This is why some Vitabiotics formulas have certain nutrient levels greater than 100% NRV. All Vitabiotics products have been developed using the latest research and contain effective levels of vitamins and minerals, while avoiding any excessive amounts, in accordance with official upper safe limits for vitamins and minerals. Vitabiotics avoids 'mega dose' levels of isolated nutrients and instead we have always stressed the importance of safe, moderate and sensible levels of vitamins and minerals, carefully balanced to maximise their combined effect; an approach which has been supported by many experts and researchers over the years. Can Feroglobin Be Taken During Pregnancy? During pregnancy, your body needs more iron than before you were expecting. Iron helps support the formation of haemoglobin for red blood cells and also helps oxygen being carried around the body. Feroglobin is suitable for use during pregnancy if you are advised to take it or feel that you may need to safeguard your iron intake. Can I Take Feroglobin And Pregnacare Together During Pregnancy?
