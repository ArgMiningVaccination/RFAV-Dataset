EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Dignity Health Dominican Hospital (Dominican) is pleased to have produced the 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). The 2022 CHNA builds upon Dominican's earlier assessments. The goals of the 2022 CHNA are to provide insight into the health of the community, prioritize local health needs, and identify areas for improvement. With this information, Dominican will develop strategies to tackle critical health needs as well as improve the overall health and well- being of community members. The assessment findings may also be used as a guideline for funding, policy, and advocacy efforts. This 2022 CHNA report documents how the current CHNA was conducted, describes the related findings, and shares the results of strategies implemented by Dominican to address the needs identified in 2019 by the previous assessment. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT BACKGROUND In addition to helping generate priorities around community health, Dominican also uses the 2022 CHNA to fulfill key state and federal mandates, as described below: California Legislative Senate Bill 697, enacted in 1994, stipulates that private nonprofit hospitals submit an annual report to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development that shall include, but shall not be limited to, a description of the activities that the hospital has undertaken to address identified community needs within its mission and financial capacity. Additionally, hospitals shall describe the process by which they involved community groups and local government officials in helping identify and prioritize community needs to be addressed. This community needs assessment shall be updated at least once every three years.1 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, enacted March 23, 2010, includes requirements for nonprofit hospitals that wish to maintain their tax-exempt status. Regulations finalized December 31, 2014 also provide guidance related to section 501(r) of the Internal Revenue Code. These regulations mandate that all nonprofit hospitals conduct a CHNA every three years. The CHNA must be conducted by the last day of a hospital's taxable year, and the hospital must make the CHNA report widely available to the public. The CHNA must also gather input from public health experts, local health departments, and community members\u2014including representatives of low-income, medically underserved, or other high-need populations.2 1 California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development.

The 2022 CHNA will serve as the basis for implementation strategies to address identified health needs. This CHNA report was adopted and made public in May, 2022. The hospital's Implementation Strategy report, based on the results of the CHNA, and Form 990, Schedule H, will be completed and filed on or before the 15th day of the fifth month after the end of the 2022 taxable year (November 15, 2022). PROCESS AND METHODS To gather information for its local planning needs and to meet state and federal mandates, Dominican took the following approach to complete the 2022 CHNA. For the purposes of the assessment, \"community health\" was not limited to traditional health measures. Dominican also considered indicators relating to the quality of life (e.g., access to health care, affordable housing, food security, education, and employment) and to the physical, environmental, and social factors that influence the health of the county's residents. This broader definition reflects Dominican's philosophy that many factors affect community health and that community health cannot be adequately understood without consideration of trends outside the realm of health care. To assess community health trends, Dominican directed its consultant, Actionable Insights (AI), to obtain secondary data from a variety of sources (see Attachment 1: Secondary Data Indicators List for a complete list). Primary data were obtained through direct community input: (a) key informant interviews with local health experts, and (b) focus groups with community leaders and front-line nonprofit staff. Prior to each interview or focus group, participants were asked to complete a short online survey, in which they were asked to identify the health needs they felt were the most pressing among the people they serve. Participants could choose up to three needs from the list of needs presented to them, which had been identified in 2019, or could write in needs that were not on the combined 2019 list. AI then tabulated how many focus groups and key informants chose each health need as a priority. The discussions sought to answer these questions for each health need that was prioritized by participants: How do you see this need playing out in the community? What differences, if any, do you see between north and south Santa Cruz County? Which populations are experiencing inequities with respect to this need? How has this need changed in the past few years; how were things going prior to the pandemic, and how are they going now? What is needed (including models/best practices) to better address this need? Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 8 In the winter of 2021, AI synthesized primary qualitative research and secondary quantitative data to create a list of health needs for Dominican. AI then filtered that list against a set of criteria to identify the significant needs of the community. These criteria included: 1. Indicator meets the definition of a \"health need.\" (See Definitions box.) 2. At least two data sources were consulted. 3.a. The issue was prioritized by at least half of key informants and focus groups. b. If not (a), two or more indicators show inequities by race/ethnicity or by geography. c. If not (b), two or more direct indicators fail the benchmark by five percent or more and/or exhibit concerning trends. DEFINITIONS Health risk: A behavioral, social, environmental, economic, or clinical care factor that impacts health. May be a social determinant of health. Health outcome: A snapshot of a disease/health event in a community that can be described in terms of both morbidity (illness or quality of life) and mortality (death). Health need: A poor health outcome and its associated risk(s), or a risk that may lead to a poor health outcome. Data source: A statistical data set, such as those found throughout the California Department of Education, or a qualitative data set, such as the material resulting from the interviews and focus groups AI conducted for the hospital. Benchmark: The California state average. Health indicator: A characteristic of an individual, population, or environment that is subject to measurement (directly or indirectly) and can be used to describe one or more aspects of the health of an individual or a population. Direct indicator: A statistic that explicitly measures a health need. For example, the lung cancer incidence rate is a direct indicator of the cancer health need. Dominican gathered the Dominican Community Advisors (DCA) group to prioritize (rank) the health needs list generated from the CHNA. The group met virtually via Zoom on February 23, 2022. After making a presentation of the data that support the health needs list, AI introduced the prioritization criterion (below) and then distributed an online survey to participants. Community priority. The community prioritizes the issue over other issues about which it has expressed concern during the CHNA primary data collection process. Score generated by Actionable Insights. Lacking sufficient community assets and/or resources. The IRS requires that hospitals take into consideration whether existing assets/resources are available to address the issue. Score generated by Actionable Insights. Disparities/inequities exist. This refers to differences in health outcomes by subgroups. Subgroups may be based on geography, languages, ethnicity, culture, citizenship status, economic status, sexual orientation, age, gender, or others. Scored by DCA based on expertise and knowledge. Magnitude/scale of the problem. This refers to the fact that the health need affects a large number of people within the community. Scored by DCA based on expertise and knowledge . Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 9 Dominican provided the slide deck and survey link to members of the DCA who could not attend the presentation. Thirteen DCA members ranked the health needs. AI merged the DCA's responses with the pre-scored criteria to generate Dominican's final list of 2022 Prioritized Health Needs. 2022 PRIORITIZED HEALTH NEEDS Based on the previously described process and methods, AI and Dominican produced a list of prioritized health needs for the hospital. Those needs, ranked from highest to lowest (an asterisk indicates a tie in ranking), are: 1. Behavioral Health* 1. Housing & Homelessness* 3. Health Care Access & Delivery* 3. Economic Insecurity* 5. Community Safety* 5. Healthy Lifestyles (Diabetes & Obesity)* 7. Cancer 8. Heart Disease/Heart Attack 9. Unintended Injuries/Accidents Further details on each prioritized health need, including statistical data and citations, are included in the complete 2022 CHNA report. NEXT STEPS After making the 2022 CHNA report publicly available on our website in May, 2022, Dominican will solicit feedback and comments about the report until two subsequent CHNA reports are posted. The hospital will also develop an implementation plan based on the 2022 CHNA results; the plan will be adopted by the Dominican board and made public by November 15, 2022.

INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND Dignity Health Dominican Hospital (Dominican) is pleased to have produced the 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). CHNA PURPOSE The goals of the 2022 CHNA are to provide insight into the health of the community, prioritize local health needs, and identify areas for improvement. With this information, Dominican will develop strategies to tackle critical health needs as well as improve the health and well-being of community members. The assessment findings may also be used as a guideline for funding, policy, and advocacy efforts. The 2022 CHNA builds upon the findings of the 2019 CHNA (see Section 8: Evaluation Findings from 2019-2021 Implemented Strategies) and previous assessments. For the 2022 CHNA, Dominican built upon existing work by starting with a list of health needs identified during the 2019 CHNA. Updated secondary data and new community input were collected for these health needs. The 2022 report documents how the current CHNA was conducted and describes the related findings. As with prior CHNAs, this assessment also includes Santa Cruz County's assets and resources (see Section 7: Community Resources). Note that, for the purposes of this assessment, \"community health\" was not limited to traditional health measures. Dominican also considered indicators relating to the quality of life (e.g., access to health care, affordable housing, food security, education, and employment) and to the physical, environmental, and social factors that influence the health of the county's residents. This broader definition reflects Dominican's philosophy that many factors affect community health and that community health cannot be adequately understood without consideration of trends outside the realm of health care. In addition to helping generate priorities around community health, Dominican also uses the 2022 CHNA to fulfill key state and federal mandates. SB 697 AND CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY OF ASSESSMENTS California Legislative Senate Bill 697, enacted in 1994, stipulates that private nonprofit hospitals submit an annual report to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development that shall include, but shall not be limited to, a description of the activities that the hospital has undertaken to address identified community needs within its mission and financial capacity. Additionally, the hospital shall describe the process by which they involved the community (community groups and local government officials) in helping identify and prioritize community needs to be addressed. This community needs assessment shall be updated at least once every three years.3 3 California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. (1998).

The Affordable Care Act, enacted March 23, 2010, includes requirements for nonprofit hospitals that wish to maintain their tax- exempt status. Regulations finalized December 31, 2014, also provide guidance related to section 501(r) of the Internal Revenue Code. These regulations mandate that all nonprofit hospitals conduct a CHNA every three years. The CHNA must be conducted by the last day of a hospital's taxable year, and hospitals must make the CHNA report widely available to the public. The CHNA report must document how the assessment was conducted, including the community served, who was involved in the assessment, the process and methods used, and the significant community health needs that were identified and prioritized as a result of the assessment. The CHNA must also gather input from public health experts, local health departments, and community members\u2014including representatives of low-income, medically underserved, or other high-need populations.4 The CHNA process, completed in fiscal year 2022 and described in this report, was conducted by Dominican in compliance with current state and federal requirements. The 2022 CHNA will serve as the basis for implementation strategies to serve identified health needs. This CHNA report will be adopted and made public in May, 2022. The hospital organization's Implementation Strategy report, based on the CHNA, and 2022 Form 990, Schedule H, will be filed on or before the 15th day of the fifth month after the end of the 2022 taxable year. WRITTEN PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE 2019 CHNA To offer the public a means to review and provide written feedback on the 2019 CHNA, Dominican posted a PDF of the Dignity Health Dominican Hospital CHNA report on the Community Health Needs Assessment page of its website5 and solicited comments via email and in writing. The 2022 CHNA will be posted to the same website. Dominican welcomes any questions about the 2022 CHNA or ideas for collaborating that the public may have, by reaching to out to Dominique Hollister, Director, Administrative Services and Community Benefit at Dominique.Hollister@DignityHealth.org . At the time the 2022 CHNA report was completed, Dominican had not received any written comments about the 2019 CHNA report. Dominican will continue to track submissions and ensure that all relevant comments are reviewed and addressed by appropriate staff. 4 U.S. Federal Register. (2014).

In 2019 Dignity Health merged with Catholic Health Initiatives to become CommonSpirit Health. Dominican Hospital is licensed for 222 inpatient beds. Dominican Hospital has a staff of 1,700 employees and professional relationships with more than 468 local physicians and allied health professionals. Major programs and services include Cardiovascular, OB/GYN, Orthopedics, General Surgery, Pulmonary, Neurosciences, Oncology, Maternal/Child Health, Level III NICU, Cardio/Thoracic/Vascular Surgery, Intensive Care Unit, Emergency Services and Rehabilitation. The hospital engages in multiple activities to conduct our community benefit and community health improvement planning process. These include, but are not limited to: conducting a Community Health Needs Assessment with community input at least every three years; using five core principles (see below) to guide planning and program decisions; measuring and tracking program indicators; and engaging the Dominican Community Advisors and other stakeholders in the development and annual updating of the community benefit plan. As a matter of Dignity Health policy, the hospital's community benefit programs incorporate one or more of the following principles: Focus on disproportionate unmet health-related needs; Emphasize prevention, including activities that address the social determinants of heath; Contribute to a seamless continuum of care; Build community capacity; and Demonstrate collaboration. In response to identified health-related needs in the Community Health Needs Assessment, Dignity Health Dominican Hospital sets forth its commitment to the care of the poor, to wellness promotion, disease prevention and education. Dignity Health Dominican Hospital's community benefit program includes financial assistance provided to those who are unable to pay the cost of their care, unpaid costs of Medicaid, subsidized health services that meet a community need, and community health improvement services. Our community benefit also includes monetary grants we provide to not-for-profit organizations that are working together to improve health on significant needs identified in our Community Health Needs Assessment. COMMUNITY SERVED Dominican relied on the Internal Revenue Service's definition of the community served by a hospital as \"those people living within its hospital service area.\" A hospital service area comprises all residents in a defined geographic area and does not exclude low-income or underserved populations. Dominican is located in Santa Cruz County and serves the entire Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 14 county. The ZIP codes associated with the community Dominican serves may be found in the table below. ZIP Codes in Hospital Service Area ZIP Code City ZIP Code City 95001 Aptos 95062 Santa Valley 95076 Watsonville 95061 Santa Cruz 95077 Watsonville Santa Cruz County In 2020, an estimated 270,861 people resided in Santa Cruz County (an increase of 3% or approximately 8,500 people since 2010).6 The county occupies 445 square miles of land approximately 35 miles southwest of Silicon Valley, with the Pacific Ocean to the west. This land includes 29 miles of coastline, forming the northern coast of Monterey Bay, and more than 44,000 acres of parks.7 6 U.S. Census Bureau Decennial Census. (2020). 7 County of Santa Cruz. (2019). About Santa Cruz County. Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 15 Almost one in four county residents lives in the city of Santa Cruz, making it the largest local municipality by population.8 The other incorporated cities are Capitola, Scotts Valley, and Watsonville. Santa Cruz County also includes the following unincorporated towns and areas:9 Amesti, Aptos, Oak, Lompico, Mount Hermon, Pajaro Dunes, Paradise Park, Pasatiempo, Pleasure Point, Rio Del Mar, Soquel, Twin Lakes, and Zayante. Demographics Nineteen percent of the population in Santa Cruz County is under the age of 18, and 17 percent is 65 years or older. These proportions are similar to California (23 percent are under age 18, and 15 percent are age 65 or older). The median age is 38.5 years old, slightly older than the state median age of 37.0 years.10 Santa Cruz County is also relatively diverse ethnically. More than half (54%) of community members are non-Latino white, and four percent are Asian. In comparison, 35 percent of California's population is non-Latino white, and nearly 15 percent is Asian. One third (35 percent) of residents have Latino heritage, somewhat less than the state proportion (39 percent).11 More than one sixth (18 percent) of Santa Cruz County residents are foreign-born, while in California overall more than one in four (27 percent) are foreign-born.12 Race/Ethnicity in Hospital Service Area Race/Ethnicity Santa Cruz County Total Percent of County (Alone) California Total Percent of State (Alone) American Indian/Alaskan 0.6% 0.6% 8 U.S. Census Bureau Quickfacts.

Various social determinants, such as income, have significant impact on health outcomes. As shown in the following chart, more than forty percent of the population lives in households with incomes of $100,000 or higher, about one fourth in households with incomes between $50,000 and $100,000, and the rest below $50,000.13 By comparison, the 2021 Self-Sufficiency Standard for a two-adult family with two school-aged children in Santa Cruz County was $119,792 per year.14 Santa Cruz County was named the sixth-most expensive California county by the Insight Center.15 Figure 1, Percent of Households by Income Range, Santa Cruz County Source: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, One-Year Estimates. (2019). Despite the fact that 42 percent of households in the county earn more than $100,000 per year, estimates show that between 2015-2019, 71 percent of county residents lived below 200 percent of the 2019 Federal Poverty Level ($24,280 for an individual, $32,920 for two adults, 13 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, One-Year Estimates.

Income barrier a. Percentage of households below the Federal poverty line, with head of household age 65 or older b. Percentage of families with children under age 18, below the Federal poverty line c. Percentage of single female-headed families with children under age 18, below the Federal poverty line 2. Cultural barrier a. Percentage of population that is minority (including Hispanic ethnicity) b. Percentage of population over age 5 that speaks English poorly or not at all 3. Educational barrier a. Percentage of population over age 25 without a high school diploma 4. Insurance barrier a. Percentage of population in the labor force, age 16 or older, without employment b. Percentage of population without health insurance 5. Housing barrier a. Percentage of households renting their home The heat map below shows the CNI score by ZIP code. The cities of Freedom and Watsonville have the highest need (4.2 out of 5.0), followed by the University of California, Santa Cruz campus (4.0 out of 5.0), then the southern part of the city of Santa Cruz and the city of Davenport (3.8 out of 5.0), and the other areas north and east of Santa Cruz (above 3.4 out of 5.0). 16 U.S. Census Bureau - American Community Survey, 2015-2019.

ASSESSMENT TEAM HOSPITALS AND OTHER PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS Dignity Health Dominican Hospital collaborated with Sutter Maternity & Surgery Center to prepare the 2022 CHNA. IDENTITY AND QUALIFICATIONS OF CONSULTANTS Actionable Insights, LLC, an independent local research firm, completed the CHNA. For this assessment, AI assisted with CHNA planning, conducted primary research, collected secondary data, synthesized primary and secondary data, facilitated the processes of identifying community health needs and assets, assisted with determining the prioritization of community health needs, and documented the processes and findings into a report. The project managers for this assessment were Melanie Espino and Jennifer van Stelle, PhD, the co-founders and principals of Actionable Insights. Actionable Insights helps organizations discover and act on data-driven insights. The firm specializes in research and evaluation in the areas of health, housing, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education, youth development and community collaboration. AI conducted community health needs assessments for seven hospitals during the 2021-2022 CHNA cycle. More information about Actionable Insights is available on the company's website.21 21 https://actionablellc.com/ Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 20 5. PROCESS AND METHODS Dominican worked together with Sutter Maternity & Surgery Center (Sutter) and their consultants to fulfill the primary and secondary data requirements of the CHNA. The CHNA data collection process took place over four months and culminated in this report. The phases of the process are depicted below. Dominican and Sutter contracted with Actionable Insights (AI) to collect and review secondary quantitative (statistical) data from other sources and primary qualitative data through key informant interviews and focus groups. SECONDARY DATA COLLECTION AI analyzed over 350 quantitative health indicators to assist the hospitals with understanding the health needs in Santa Cruz County and assessing priorities in the community. AI collected data from existing sources using the DataShare Santa Cruz data platform, the Santa Cruz Community Assessment Project, the Central California Alliance's 2021 Health Education and Cultural and Linguistic Population Needs Assessment, and the U.S. Census Bureau. Supported by a wide variety of organizations in Santa Cruz County including the county's Public Health Department, DataShare Santa Cruz is considered \"the central hub of information for the county.\"22 As a further framework for the assessment, the hospitals asked AI to address these questions in its analysis: How do these indicators perform against statewide benchmarks? Were there any concerning trends? Are there disparate outcomes and conditions for people in the community? PRIMARY DATA COLLECTION (COMMUNITY INPUT) Actionable Insights conducted primary research for this assessment. AI used two strategies for collecting community input: key informant interviews with health and community- service experts, and focus groups with professionals and community members. Primary research protocols were generated by AI in collaboration with the hospitals, based on a discussion with them about what they wished to learn during the 2022 CHNA. The hospitals sought to build upon prior CHNAs by focusing the primary research on topics and subpopulations that are less well understood by the statistical data. Actionable Insights conducted the key informant interviews and focus groups for this assessment. AI recorded each interview and focus group. Recordings were transcribed and qualitative research software tools were used to analyze the transcripts for common themes. AI 22 https://www.datasharescc.org/ Secondary Data Collection Primary Data Collection Data Synthesis Health Needs List Prioritization Report Writing Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 21 also tabulated how many times health needs were prioritized by each of the focus groups or identified as a priority by a key informant. The hospitals used this tabulation to help assess community health priorities. Across the key informant interviews and focus groups, AI solicited input from 26 community leaders and representatives of various organizations and sectors. These representatives either work in the health field or in a community-based organization that focuses on improving health and quality of life conditions by serving those from IRS-identified high-need target populations.23 See Attachment 4: Community Leaders, Representatives, and Members Consulted for the names, titles, and expertise of these leaders and representatives along with the date and mode of consultation (focus group or key informant interview). See Attachment 3: Qualitative Research Protocols for complete protocols and questions, including pre-surveys. Key Informant Interviews In September 2021, AI conducted primary research via key informant interviews with seven Santa Cruz County experts from various organizations. These experts included the director of the county health system and leaders of community-based organizations. Interviews were conducted virtually via Zoom for approximately one hour. Prior to each interview, participants were asked to complete a short online survey, in which they were asked to identify the health needs they felt were the most pressing among the people they serve. Interviewees could choose up to three needs from the list of needs presented to them, which had been identified in 2019, or could write in needs that were not on the combined 2019 list. Also in the survey, participants were advised of how their interview data would be used and were asked to consent to be recorded.24 Finally, participants were offered the option of being listed in the report and were asked to provide some basic demographic information (also optional). The discussions centered around the following questions for each health need that was prioritized by interviewees: How do you see this need playing out in the community? What differences, if any, do you see between north and south county? Which populations are experiencing inequities with respect to this need? How has this need changed in the past few years; how were things going prior to the pandemic, and how are they going now? What is needed (including models/best practices) to better address this need? AI sent a similar survey to focus group participants, and asked focus groups the same questions during discussion (modified appropriately for each audience).25 Focus group discussions 23 The IRS requires that community input include the low-income, minority, and medically underserved populations. 24 Only individuals who consented to be recorded were interviewed. 25 Only individuals who consented to be recorded were included in focus groups. To preserve their anonymity, community members who participated in the clinic patients focus group were not offered the option of being listed in the report. Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 22 centered on the needs that had received the most votes from prospective participants in the online pre-survey. Focus Groups AI conducted two focus groups in Santa Cruz County with a total of 19 community representatives in September and October 2021. Nonprofit hosts recruited participants for the groups. The questions were the same as those asked of key informants. Details of Focus Groups Topic Focus Group Host Date Number of Participants North County health Community Bridges 9/17/2021 9 South County health Community Action Board 10/4/2021 10 CHNA Participant Demographics A total of 26 people participated in focus groups or interviews for the CHNA. Nearly complete demographic data were available (i.e., N=25 for all demographics). The charts below show the age ranges of responding participants, as well as their race; note that individuals could choose more than one race. Three-fifths (60%) of responding participants were of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity; the same proportion identified as white. All responding participants (100%) identified as female. On average, responding participants were aged 43 years. Participant Age Groups Participant Racial/Ethnic Groups * \"Other\" includes American Indian/AK Native and Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 23 INFORMATION GAPS AND LIMITATIONS A lack of data limited our ability to fully assess some health issues that were identified as community needs during the 2022 CHNA process. Conducting the 2022 CHNA presented unique challenges for data collection. Because of the pandemic, it was not safe to bring community members together in person. Moreover, nonprofit partners advised that the community was severely stressed (financially and emotionally) by the pandemic and felt it was inappropriate to burden them with CHNA data collection requests, especially given that digital access is lacking in some parts of the county and for some low-income community members. In order to best represent the perspectives and experiences of low-income, minority, and underserved community members during the pandemic, AI spoke with a wide array of nonprofit staff who work with vulnerable populations, including front-line staff who live in Santa Cruz County. We acknowledge this as a limitation in our 2022 CHNA data. Additionally, some indicators are difficult to measure or are just emerging. Statistical information related to these topics was outdated or not included in DataShare Santa Cruz: Linguistic isolation/English proficiency data not available, (important in light of the fact that 34% speak a language other than English at home) Oral health data lacking, not available by race Asthma data for children/teens is old (2015-16) Infectious disease data lacking by race/ethnicity Unintended injuries lack data, including falls data Cognitive decline lacks data; only one indicator (Alzheimer's Disease or Dementia incidence) Infant mortality is not recent (2012) and breakdowns by race are not available, although it is known nationally that Black infant health is a persistent inequity. Data on human trafficking not included in the dataset Youth cigarette and e-cigarette use Recent marijuana use and related behavioral health data Impact of social media on adolescent mental health Caregiver health effects Data on experiences of discrimination Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 24 6. IDENTIFICATION AND PRIORITIZATION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS In the analysis of quantitative and qualitative data, many health issues surfaced. To be identified as one of the community's prioritized health needs, an issue had to meet certain criteria, as depicted in the diagram and described below. (See Definitions box on the next page for terms and definitions.) CRITERIA In the winter of 2021, AI synthesized primary qualitative research and secondary quantitative data to create a list of health needs for Dominican. AI then filtered that list against a set of criteria to identify the significant needs of the community. These criteria included: 1. Indicator meets the definition of a \"health need.\" (See Definitions box.) 2. At least two data sources were consulted. 3. a. The issue was prioritized by at least half of key informants and focus groups. b. If not (a), two or more indicators show inequities by race/ethnicity or by geography. c. If not (b), two or more direct indicators fail the benchmark by five percent or more and/or exhibit concerning trends. Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 25 Actionable Insights (AI) analyzed secondary statistical data and qualitative data from focus groups and key informant interviews on a variety of health and health-related issues. At the end of 2021, AI then synthesized the data for each issue and applied the criteria described above to evaluate whether it qualified as a significant community health need. This process led to the identification of nine community health needs that fit all three criteria. The list of needs, in priority order, appears below, followed by summarized descriptions. (For further details about each of these health needs, including statistical data, see Attachment 2: Secondary Data Tables.) DEFINITIONS Health risk: A behavioral, social, environmental, economic, or clinical care factor that impacts health. May be a social determinant of health. Health outcome: A snapshot of a disease/health event in a community that can be described in terms of both morbidity (illness or quality of life) and mortality (death). Health need: A poor health outcome and its associated risk(s), or a risk that may lead to a poor health outcome. Data source: A statistical data set, such as those found throughout the California Department of Education, or a qualitative data set, such as the material resulting from the interviews and focus groups AI conducted for the hospital. Benchmark: The California state average. Health indicator: A characteristic of an individual, population, or environment that is subject to measurement (directly or indirectly) and can be used to describe one or more aspects of the health of an individual or a population. Direct indicator: A statistic that explicitly measures a health need. For example, the lung cancer incidence rate is a direct indicator of the cancer health need. PRIORITIZATION OF HEALTH NEEDS The IRS CHNA requirements state that hospitals must identify and prioritize significant health needs of the community. As described in Section 5: Process and Methods, Actionable Insights solicited qualitative input from focus group and interview participants about which needs they thought were the highest priority (most pressing) and used this input to identify the significant health needs listed in this report. Therefore, the health needs list itself reflects the health priorities of the community. Hospital Prioritization Process and Results Dominican gathered the Dominican Community Advisors (DCA) group to prioritize (rank) the health needs list generated from the CHNA. The group met virtually via Zoom on February 23, 2022. After making a presentation of the data that support the health needs list, AI introduced the prioritization criterion (following pages) and then distributed an online survey to participants. Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 26 Criterion Scoring Key Community priority. The community prioritizes the issue over other issues about which it has expressed concern during the CHNA primary data collection process. Score generated by Actionable Insights: \"3\" - Prioritized as one of the top three needs by at least one half of all focus groups and key informants \"1\" - Not prioritized by at least half of all focus groups and key informants Lacking sufficient community assets and/or resources. The IRS requires that hospitals take into consideration whether existing assets/resources are available to address the issue. Score generated by Actionable Insights based on number or assets/resources in the county: Score N Resources 3 - Insufficient 0-25 2 - Moderately sufficient 26-50 1 - Fully sufficient 51+ Disparities/inequities exist. This refers to differences in health outcomes by subgroups. Subgroups may be based on geography, languages, ethnicity, culture, citizenship status, economic status, sexual orientation, age, gender, or others. Scored by DCA based on expertise and knowledge: 3 - Large disparities/inequities 2 - Moderate disparities/inequities 1 - Few/no disparities/inequities Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 27 Criterion Scoring Key Magnitude/scale of the problem. This refers to the fact that the health need affects a large number of people within the community. Scored by DCA based on expertise and knowledge: 3 - Very big problem 2 - Moderately big problem 1 - No/relatively low magnitude Dominican provided the slide deck and survey link to members of the DCA who could not attend the presentation. The following DCA members ranked the health needs: David Brody, First 5 Santa Cruz County Keisha Browder, United Way of Santa Cruz County Sonya Drottar, Dignity Health Dominican Dominique Hollister, Dir. Administrative Services & Community Benefit, Dignity Health Dominican Hospital Shebreh Kalantari-Johnson, City of Santa Cruz, Social Impact Consultant (not in attendance) Carol Lezin, JR Parish Susan MacMillan, Dignity Health Dominican Hospital Nan Mickiewicz, MD, Dignity Health Dominican Hospital Erica Padilla Chavez, Pajaro Valley Prevention & Student Assistance Cara Pearson, Pacific Cookie Company Nash Solano, Dignity Health Dominican Hospital Steve Snodgrass, Granite Rock CFO Greg Whitley, MD, Dignity Health Dominican Hospital AI merged the DCA's responses with the pre-scored criteria to generate Dominican's final list of 2022 Prioritized Health Needs. 2022 PRIORITIZED HEALTH NEEDS Based on the previously described process and methods, AI and Dominican produced a list of prioritized health needs for the hospital. Those needs, ranked from highest to lowest (an asterisk indicates a tie in ranking), are: Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 28 1. Behavioral Health* 1. Housing & Homelessness* 3. Health Care Access & Delivery* 3. Economic Insecurity* 5. Community Safety* 5. Healthy Lifestyles (Diabetes & Obesity)* 7. Cancer 8. Heart Disease/Heart Attack 9. Unintended Injuries/Accidents Summary descriptions of each health need appear on pages 32-43. COVID-19 In late 2019, a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) appeared. It causes a respiratory illness that is now called COVID-19.26 The ensuing pandemic has been a health event of historic proportions.27 By mid-April 2022, COVID-19 had caused an estimated 6,197,000 deaths worldwide and 987,200 deaths nationwide.28 In absolute terms, the COVID-19 pandemic has surpassed the 1918 influenza (H1N1) pandemic, which killed 550,000 Americans (0.5% of the U.S. population at that time).29 The COVID-19 pandemic shows signs of continuing for the foreseeable future. In Santa Cruz County, the numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths peaked several times since March of 2020.30 However, vaccinations\u2014which began in early 2021\u2014appear to be mitigating local hospitalizations and deaths. The latest COVID-19 statistics for Santa Cruz County are available in Attachment 2. Because COVID is a new virus, many health effects and health care needs are still emerging.

To capture the effects of COVID on the community, the hospitals collaborating on the 2022 community health needs assessment conducted various focus groups and interviews.31 They also chose to add \"documented ethnic and/or geographic disparities and inequities\" to their criteria for identifying community health needs in 2022. The hospitals will continue to monitor and address health effects, trends, and health care needs of COVID-19 as they learn more about the disease, its progression, and its short- and long-term impacts. The pandemic has exacerbated existing inequities in the health and welfare of vulnerable populations in the U.S., causing disproportionate illness and mortality for people in minority racial and ethnic groups (i.e., Black, Indigenous, and people of color: BIPOC),32 people with certain pre-existing health conditions,33 people living in crowded conditions,34 and people who are classified as \"essential workers\" (at higher risk of workplace exposure).35 Approximately one in 10 people who were infected experience \"long COVID,\" a set of lingering symptoms including \"fatigue, body aches, shortness of breath, difficulty concentrating\" that lasts a year or more.36 Perhaps the most far-reaching impacts of COVID-19 are socioeconomic. The government mandates shutting down or limiting activities in major industries (tourism, hospitality, brick-and- mortar retail and services, etc.) exacerbated the inequities experienced by many of the vulnerable populations identified above.

The physical toll this can take on their bodies has no equivalent among white Americans. The inflammation from toxic stress contributes to greater comorbidities among the BIPOC population in the U.S. compared to whites.41 BIPOC individuals are also more likely to work higher-risk and/or low-wage jobs,42 in part due to employment 37 Udalova, V.

SUMMARY DESCRIPTIONS OF 2022 PRIORITIZED COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS Behavioral Health Behavioral health, which includes mental health and trauma as well as substance use, was prioritized by both focus groups and all key informants. Mental health statistics were concerning. A greater percentage of adults in Santa Cruz County were likely experiencing serious psychological distress compared to all Californians, and this figure was growing, especially in ZIP code 95076 (Corralitos, La Selva Beach, Mt. Madonna, Pajaro, Royal Oaks, and Watsonville). Both Latino and white community members were more likely to experience this than people of other races/ethnicities in Santa Cruz County. Moreover, people living in Watsonville were more likely to have had a frequent experience of poor mental health days (more than two weeks per month) than people in other areas of the county. Adults Likely Experiencing Serious Psychological Distress ZIP Code 95076 Source: California Health Interview Survey. Note, county-wide statistics are 2018-19. Greater proportions of Santa Cruz County adults thought about committing suicide compared to Californians overall. This statistic was especially high among the county's white and multiethnic populations. Among the county's students, depression and suicidal ideation have been on the rise. Perhaps relatedly, the proportion of youth who report having caring relationships with adults has been dropping, and the proportion who report feeling high expectations from adults has been dropping. 12.0%15.6%16.6% 14.1% 0%2%4%6%8%10%12%14%16%18% CA Santa Cruz County Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 33 Key informants and focus group participants described stress and anxiety among county residents. They were especially concerned about the isolation experienced by older adults, children, and youth during the pandemic, as well as the effect of the pandemic on the mental health of young adults whose futures are uncertain. Poor access to mental and behavioral health care was described as a common issue, with a lack of providers and programs being especially common in the southern part of the county and also in rural parts of the north. Participants expressed the need for residential psychiatric facilities, of which at least one is already underway. While the proportion of adults who both needed and received behavioral health care was better among county residents than the state average, there is a downward trend, and the county's white and Latino populations who need care were less likely to receive needed behavioral health help than their peers. There was also discussion of trauma in the county population due to intimate partner violence, generational poverty, and homelessness. Mental illness was mentioned specifically in relation to the homeless population. Regarding substance use, the rate of opioid prescriptions to Santa Cruz County opioid-na\u00efve patients is higher than that of Californians overall. Overdose death rates were higher in the county than in California overall, including opioid and amphetamine overdose (especially in ZIP code 95076), heroin overdose, and prescription opioid overdose. Opioid overdose was highest in Santa Cruz County among Black and white residents. The county's white community members also had the highest rate of emergency department visits due to heroin overdose. CHNA participants expressed concern about the rising rates of opioid overdoses, as well as fentanyl and methamphetamine. Liquor store density and the average amount of spending on alcoholic beverages are both higher in the county than the state, while alcohol, tobacco, and legal marijuana expenditures have been rising in ZIP code 95076. Adult binge drinking is highest among white, Latino, American Indian, and multiethnic people in Santa Cruz County and among residents of Ben Lomond, Boulder Creek, Brookdale, Felton, and Lompico. Housing & Homelessness Both focus groups and nearly all key informants identified housing, homelessness, and economic stability (see Economic Stability ) as top community priorities. Housing costs in Santa Cruz County are extremely high; compared to all Californians, higher proportions of Santa Cruz County homeowners and renters (the latter especially in Boulder Creek, Lompico, and Watsonville) are spending more than 30% of their income on housing. In addition, expenses associated with housing are higher for homeowners in the county compared to the state. The proportion of overcrowded homes has been increasing in Santa Cruz County, as has the total number of people experiencing homelessness. Finally, the percentage of homes with severe housing problems (one or more of overcrowding, high housing costs, lack of kitchen, or lack of plumbing facilities) is also higher in the county than the state. BIPOC individuals in the U.S. are more likely to live in crowded or substandard conditions and impoverished neighborhoods, in part due to historical red-lining policies and present-day Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 34 housing discrimination.48 In Santa Cruz County, residential segregation (white vs. non-white) is substantially worse than in California overall. Most feedback about housing from key informants and focus group participants centered around homelessness, with concerns expressed about homeless shelters closing and a possible rise in the number of unsheltered people. An expert noted that many individuals experiencing homelessness in Santa Cruz County are employed, suggesting that wages aren't high enough to support the cost of living. Others spoke to the need for tenant protections and mentioned that during COVID, landlords may have evicted families with undocumented members because they expected these families would not seek legal protections. Finally, the recent wildfires in the county have stressed many, especially low-income individuals and families who struggle to afford to fix the damage to their homes that FEMA or insurance may not cover. Health Care Access and Delivery Health care access and delivery, which affects various other community health needs, was identified as a top health need by nearly all key informants. The proportion of Santa Cruz County residents who reported delaying or having difficulty obtaining care was higher than the state average (and especially high for the county's white population), as was the proportion of adults who had a routine check-up. The latter statistic has been worsening over time and is particularly low for the county's Asian and white populations, as well as for residents of Freedom and Watsonville. Older adults in those two cities were least likely to receive recommended preventive care compared to their peers in other parts of the county. Additionally, Black residents of Santa Cruz County were much less likely to have a usual source of health care compared to the state average. Every interviewee and focus group discussion mentioned a shortage of health care workers across the spectrum from primary to specialty care. Key informants and focus group participants felt there were too few Medi-Cal providers, which they thought was at least partially due to the low Medi-Cal reimbursement rate. In addition, participants said that due to the pandemic, worker burnout is high. It was suggested that staff need more training in trauma-informed care to better serve patients. Participants also indicated a need for the development of career pathways for BIPOC and Spanish-speaking health care workers so that county residents can see and be seen by people like themselves. Workers who speak non-Spanish Latin American languages and have Latino American cultural competency are also needed. Additionally, there was agreement that there are too few facilities in the county, especially for urgent care, and 48 Iton, A., & Ross, R. K. (2017).

Telehealth was reported to have had mixed results, with access harder especially for those without reliable Internet access, which tends to disproportionately affect people who are low-income, rural, and/or non-white.49 The level of county residents' expenditures on health insurance was also higher than the California average, while the average gross premium for Covered California enrollees has been trending up and residents' expenditures on medical supplies and medications (prescription and non-prescription) have been rising. Although the proportion of county residents with health insurance (92%) is better than California, it does not meet the Healthy People 2030 aspirational goal of 100% insured. The proportion of adults without health insurance is higher in Freedom and Watsonville (and ZIP code 95076) than in other parts of the county. Finally, the number of dentists per 100,000 people in the county is still lower than the state average but has been rising. This appears to be a greater issue in the southern part of Santa Cruz County; a smaller percentage of adults in southern Santa Cruz County had visited a dentist compared to their peers statewide, and the proportion of older adults with total tooth loss is worse in the southern part of the county than the state average. Economic Insecurity Both focus groups and nearly all key informants identified economic stability and housing (see Housing and Homelessness ) as top community priorities. Income inequalities by race are substantial in Santa Cruz County, with median household income figures for all BIPOC groups lower than the statewide average while median household income for white Santa Cruz County residents is, on average, nearly 10% higher than California overall. Larger proportions of people (including families) live below the poverty level in Brookdale, Freedom, and Watsonville than in other parts of the county. Most BIPOC populations in Santa Cruz County have higher rates of poverty than the county's white or multiracial populations. The county also has a greater proportion of households with older adults that are below a certain income threshold (the \"Elder Economic Security Standard Index\") than California overall. Additionally, the proportion of older adults in the county who are living in poverty has been rising slightly, and is especially high in Boulder Creek and Brookdale, as well as among the county's Asian and Black older adults (wherever they live). Economic precariousness can force people to choose between paying rent and accessing health care; it can also lead to homelessness and the many barriers to health that unhoused individuals face. Although overall and child-specific food insecurity in Santa Cruz County had been dropping before the pandemic50, these figures were projected to rise in 2020.

Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 36 greater percentages of students are becoming eligible for free or reduced-price meals over time. Even more concerning, the proportion of food-insecure children who are likely ineligible for assistance grew substantially between 2018 (16%) and 2019 (27%). Nationwide, food insecurity affects children of color \"disproportionately, with Black and Hispanic households reporting rates nearly double that of white households.\"51 Santa Cruz County Food Insecurity Source: Feeding America. Education is a driver of income. The county's rate of high school dropout is higher and the high school graduation rate is lower than California's rates, respectively, and the student-to-teacher ratio is worse as well. Education generally correlates with income; therefore, educational statistics that differ by race/ethnicity are particularly concerning. Smaller proportions of the county's Latino inhabitants have at least a high school diploma compared to all Californians. There are issues with digital (Internet) access and access to computing devices in Freedom and Watsonville, complicating the ability for students in these areas to complete school, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when lessons were delivered remotely for many months. Qualitative data showed that COVID created more economic insecurity for those who lost work and also increased food insecurity. Key informants and focus group participants highlighted the undocumented population as being particularly vulnerable because they are not eligible for public benefits such as unemployment or economic stimulus payments. 51 Bauer, K.W., Aaronson, S., & Stewart, J.

Hate crimes in the county also increased slightly compared to the prior year. In addition, arrest rates for Santa Cruz County adults and juveniles (under age 18) are substantially higher than the respective state rates. Deaths in custody are twice as high for the county's Latino community members than the state average. Nationally, Latinos are overrepresented in prisons and jails compared to their overall share of the population.52 However, this does not fully account for the disproportionality in deaths among Latinos in custody in Santa Cruz County. Some experts expressed concern about COVID-related stress contributing to intimate partner violence. CHNA participants also shared a perception that youth violence is rising. Data show that fewer Santa Cruz County youth feel very safe at school and that 9th-graders carry weapons to school more often than in the past. Finally, participants described a need for greater safety among unsheltered people living in encampments and expressed concern about police treatment of people experiencing homelessness.

In addition, adult obesity and overweight are highest among the county's Latino population, while obese adults are overrepresented among the county's multiethnic population. Santa Cruz County's Filipino 5th- graders and Latino 5th- and 9th-graders are less likely to be a healthy weight compared to their county- or statewide peers, but the trends for 5th- and 9th-graders are improving. The percentage of children and teenagers who engage in regular physical activity is trending down (especially in ZIP code 95076). Children Ages 2-11 Overweight for Age Source: California Health Interview Survey, Neighborhood Edition (2017-18). The food environment is related to residents' ability to maintain a healthy weight. Fast food expenditures are higher in Santa Cruz County than in California, and expenditures on high- sugar foods and beverages are trending upward. Fast food consumption is especially high among the county's Asian population. The county's CalFresh enrollment numbers increased substantially between 2019 and 2020, likely signaling a rise in food insecurity due to the pandemic. Finally, the ratio of recreation and fitness facilities in the county compared to the population has been decreasing. Although neither the statistical data nor the key informants and focus group participants connected diabetes and obesity with health disparities or inequities, experts writing on behalf of the American Diabetes Association describe placing \"socioeconomic disparities and the other [social determinants of health] downstream from racism\u2014which we posit is a root cause for disparities in diabetes outcomes in marginalized and minoritized populations.\"53 53 Ogunwole, S.

In addition, the breast cancer incidence rate among Santa Cruz County women is worse than California women overall, and it is especially high for white women. Mammography screening levels, an early cancer detection measure, are worsening among the county's Medicare population. The prostate cancer incidence rate among Santa Cruz County men overall is worse than their statewide peers, particularly for white men. Colorectal cancer screening levels are lower in Freedom and Watsonville compared to the Healthy People 2030 target.

The National Cancer Institute acknowledges socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in cancer detection, treatment, and outcomes. It attributes these to a variety of factors, including institutional racism and conscious or unconscious bias among care providers, as well as barriers such as low income, low health literacy, lack of insurance, and lack of transportation. It also acknowledges the role of neighborhoods in cancer risks (e.g., when a neighborhood has poor access to affordable healthy food, residents are more likely to be obese, which is a cancer risk factor).

Adults with Heart Disease, Santa Cruz County Source: California Health Interview Survey, Neighborhood Edition. In several areas of the county, residents are doing worse than their statewide peers. For example, adults in La Selva Beach have a higher rate of high cholesterol prevalence compared to the state average, while smaller proportions of adults in Freedom and Watsonville have had a cholesterol test than their peers statewide. Watsonville adults are also more likely to have experienced a stroke than the state average. Finally, adult residents with high blood pressure in Freedom, Lompico, and Watsonville are all less likely to be taking medication for high blood pressure than adults countywide. In general, people of color are more likely than whites to experience adverse childhood experiences, which can lead to toxic stress, which generates an inflammatory response that contributes to chronic diseases such as heart disease.55 The role 54 National Cancer Institute.

In addition, the bicycle-involved collision rate is higher in the county than the state. Racial inequities in accident rates have been found nationwide and are attributed in part to unequal access to safe transportation.57 The absence of sidewalks in low-income neighborhoods is another factor related to inequities in pedestrian accident rates nationally.58 Bicycle-Involved Collisions Rate Source: California State Highway Patrol (2017).

Although no available climate statistics were worse for Santa Cruz County than the state, the county has several worsening trends that the hospital will continue to monitor. There is increased use of electricity and natural gas among the county's residents. Many electric plants use natural gas to generate electricity.59 The use of natural gas can cause an increase in carbon dioxide emissions, which can affect respiratory health.60 In fact, a greater proportion of children and teens in Santa Cruz County have asthma than their statewide counterparts, as is also the case for adults in Freedom. Focus group participants mentioned the adverse effects of wildfires, particularly on low- income individuals, especially regarding the mental and financial stress of evacuation and home repair. The recent increase in wildfires likely also had an impact on local asthma rates, with air quality in Santa Cruz County in 2020 at times being the worst it had been in two decades.61 While the number of extreme precipitation days in Santa Cruz County has been rising, residents have been less likely to install rainwater harvesting systems or means for reducing storm water and irrigation run-off than in the past. Such systems can reduce erosion and the degradation of water quality, and contribute to recharging stores of groundwater.62 Residents have expressed more concern about water pollution than in the past. 59 Union of Concerned Scientists.

Impact: Both the hospital taskforce and Monarch Services programs work to identify and provide support to victims of human trafficking. Eighty-five percent of those identified by Monarch Services will have increased access to social support services. Collaboration: The hospital partners with Monarch Services, the Santa Cruz County District Attorney, the Santa Cruz County Sheriff, and the Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties' Coalition to End Human Trafficking. Additional detail on the impact of actions taken is available in the hospital's annual community benefit reports. The most recent of these is on the hospital's website, and earlier ones can be requested. Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 52 COMMUNITY GRANTS PROGRAM One important way the hospital helps to address community health needs is by awarding financial grants to non-profit organizations working together to improve health status and quality of life. Grant funds are used to deliver services and strengthen service systems, to improve the health and well-being of vulnerable and underserved populations. In FY20, the hospital awarded the grants below totaling $189,646; in FY21, $190,244; and in FY22, $191,017.

Dominican Hospital held over 60 COVID-19 clinics, made in large part possible by the hospital's physicians, nurses, and employees who volunteered hundreds of hours to provide vaccinations to the community. Dominican Hospital held over 60 vaccination clinics and administered over 38,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. This included numerous mobile clinics which sought out those with the least access to healthcare. Through a partnership with the Santa Cruz County Farm Bureau, California Strawberry Commission and Santa Cruz County Ag Commissioner, Dominican Hospital administered over 6,500 doses to agricultural workers. Partnered with Pajaro Valley Prevention and Student Assistance to provide vaccines for 600 South County and North Monterey County residents. Working with the Center for Farmworker Families, Dominican Hospital vaccine clinic members attended Oaxacan meetings in backyards and garages in Watsonville to provide vaccinations. The Oaxacan population is insular and many only speak the indigenous language Mixtec, which is a barrier to obtaining vaccine information and often results in vaccine hesitancy. Dominican Hospital brought clinics to RotaCare as they served the uninsured and underserved in the City of Santa Cruz. Dominican Hospital's mobile vaccine clinics extended from Pajaro into North Santa Cruz County and included geographically isolated communities. Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 54 9. CONCLUSION Dignity Health Dominican Hospital (Dominican) worked with Sutter Maternity & Surgery Center and their consultants to conduct the 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). The 2022 CHNA builds upon prior health assessments and meets federally mandated requirements and California state regulations. Dominican identified priority community health needs through the assessment, which included collecting secondary data and conducting new primary research (i.e., community input). Dominican's Community Advisory Board then prioritized the health needs based on a set of defined criteria. This CHNA report was adopted and made public in May, 2022. Next steps for the hospital: Monitor community comments on the CHNA report (ongoing). Select priority health needs to address using a set of criteria. Develop strategies to address priority health needs. Ensure strategies are adopted by the Dominican board and made publicly available. Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 55 10.

All data was provided by DataShare Santa Cruz, which is publicly available repository. Please consult the Indicator List (Attachment 1) for details about original data sources or refer to the DataShare public portal (www.datasharescc.org ) for more details. LEGEND Statistical data tables compare county data to California state benchmarks. Tables are provided in alphabetical order. Definitions Incidence rate: Rate of new cases within a specific time period Mortality rate: Rate of deaths from a given condition compared with a specified population. Prevalence: Proportion of a population with a given condition Age-adjusted rate: Statistically modified rate that eliminates the effect of different age distributions in the populations Race/Ethnicity and Sub-County Data Certain indicators are available by ethnicity, which shows disparities in certain populations. Those tables follow each of the overall health need tables if available and include all data by race/ethnicity. The same formatting described above is used for the race/ethnicity tables. We use the shorthand \"Native Am\" for the term \"Native American.\" Native American also encompasses Alaskan Native. \"Pac Isl\" is shorthand for the term \"Pacific Islander.\" Pacific Islander also encompasses Hawaiian Native. We use the term \"Black/Afr Anc\" for individuals who are of African Ancestry, including African-Americans and foreign-born individuals. Certain indicators are available by sub-county area, including City and Zip Code. These data were analyzed for significant inequities, and findings for the most compelling inequities are listed after Race/Ethnicity data. Conventions Health needs are listed in alphabetical order for easy reference. Benchmark values represent the California state average/rate. Rates are per 100,000 unless otherwise noted. Data are rounded to the tenths if available. Formatting for comparisons to benchmarks: o Data that are worse than benchmarks are emboldened . o Data that are 5% (not five percentage points, but five percent) worse than benchmarks are marked with a diamond ( ). o Trend arrows show the directionality of the trend, and are color-coded aqua for improving trend and red for worsening trend. \"S\" in this column denotes that the trend is significant over time. (Trends that were only compared to one previous data point were not marked as significant.)

Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 149 ATTACHMENT 3: QUALITATIVE RESEARCH PROTOCOLS CHNA KII Protocol - Professionals (60 min.) PREP Schedule call, send survey and main questions [ minimum: 1 week ahead of time ]. 48 hours before: Review the individual's background on LinkedIn and/or their organization's website; review their survey response (health needs they identified). Send reminder email; remind them of their survey response (most pressing needs among those they serve) and the main questions. If they didn't respond to the survey, include the link and ask them to respond ASAP before the interview. INTRODUCTION (5 MIN.) [Start recording from the beginning of the session.] Welcome and thanks What the project is about: Identifying health needs in our community, including social determinants of health (called the Community Health Needs Assessment or CHNA). A CHNA is required of all non-profit hospitals in the U.S. every three years. The report based on this assessment will be a snapshot in time; this report will be published next year (in 2022) and consulted through 2025. Will inform investments that hospitals make to address community needs. Our interview is scheduled for sixty minutes -- does that still work for you? Today's questions: Better understand the needs you identified as most pressing in Santa Cruz County Which populations are experiencing inequities related to the needs Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 150 How things may have changed in the past few years (trends) Any models or best practices you know of for addressing the needs Areas of concern [If not one of the needs identified:] Your expertise as it relates to the community's needs [If not one of the needs identified:] Your comments on how the pandemic has affected the people you serve What we'll do with the information you tell us today: Will record so that we can get the most accurate record possible Will not share the audio itself; transcript will go to hospitals Hospitals will make decisions about which needs they can best address We can keep anything confidential, even the whole interview. Let me know any time. [First half depends on their survey response:] Plan to name you/your organization in the report where we list all the experts we consulted, but will not attach your name to any quotes we might use. Any questions before I begin? [If we don't have the answer, commit to finding it and sending later via email.] Kick on Zoom recording! HEALTH NEEDS DISCUSSION (35 MIN.) You identified [ read list] as the most pressing needs for the people you serve. For each of these needs, I'll ask you four things [ read only bold text to introduce this section ]: Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 151 1. Please describe how you see the need playing out , including how well the need is being addressed right now and what barriers might exist to seeing better outcomes. Probe: Who is addressing the need? [ Prompts for barriers if they are having trouble thinking of any: Income/economic issues, language, culture/stigma, lack of awareness/education, policies/laws, budget cuts, lack of community resources, geographic location (north vs. south county), transportation, housing, addiction, stress, being victims of abuse/bullying/crime] 2. This may overlap the previous question, but I'll ask you to identify which populations are experiencing inequities with respect to the need (that is, who are better or worse off than others) and explain their situation. [Prompts for populations if they are having trouble thinking of any : north vs. south county, income/education level, housing status, language, immigration status, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, geographic location] 3. Third, to say how things may have changed in the last few years (since we know that the data always lag what is happening now). What emerging trends or areas of concern do you see? Think about how things were going prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and also how they are now, with the impact of the pandemic. 4. Finally, I'll ask you to explain what you feel is needed to better address this need , including any models or best practices for addressing the need. Probe: Who should be doing that (addressing this need)? [ Prompts if needed: Practices you have observed within your health system or organization, in our county agencies, national practices you've heard about, or practices you've read about in literature.] OK, let's get started. For [name first need], [start at Q1; address all four questions, then go back to Q1-4 with second need, again with third need, then go on to the questions below.] Only if their expertise was not related to one or more of the needs chosen: FURTHER DISCUSSION: THEIR EXPERTISE (5-10 min.) You were invited to share your expertise/experience about [ e.g., substance use disorder, senior health, or homelessness ]. Let's talk a little about that; how does it relate to the community's health needs? Only if COVID was not chosen as a need/was not discussed in the context of other needs: FURTHER DISCUSSION: CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC (5-10 min.) I know you didn't identify the coronavirus as a specific need; would you mind... Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 2022 CHNA 152 Telling me about the effects of the pandemic you may be seeing among the people you serve (not just among those who were ill with COVID)? What inequities are you seeing? How have things changed since COVID began? ADDITIONAL COMMENTS (time permitting) We have a few minutes left; is there anything else you would like to add regarding community health needs? Anything else we can convey to the hospitals? REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE WITH ASSETS LIST (2 min.) The IRS requires that we get feedback from the community on potential resources available to address these health needs. We are compiling a list of resources by health need later this spring, which will be based on 2-1-1's list. Would you be willing to review a list at that time, related to your area of expertise, and give us feedback? For example, we may ask whether the resources seem sufficient or if there are resources available that we have missed. [Make a note as to whether they agree or not.] CLOSING (1 min.) You can look for the hospitals' CHNA reports to be made publicly available on their individual websites in the second half of 2022. If anything occurs to you later that you would like to add to this interview, please feel free to send me an email. Thank you so much for contributing your expertise and experience to the CHNA.

Will not share the video itself; transcript or notes will go to hospital When we are finished with all of the focus groups, we will read all of the transcripts and summarize the things we learn. We will also use some quotes so that the hospital can read your own words. We will not use your name when we give them those quotes. If for any reason you are deciding that you do not want to participate, it is OK to leave the meeting now. No hard feelings! Guidelines: We know you have other commitments and we really appreciate you taking the time out of your day to be here. It is my job to move us along to keep us on time. I may interrupt you; I don't mean any disrespect, but it is important to get to all of the questions so we can finish on time. We understand that you may have distractions on your end; we ask that you do the best you can to remain present, and let us know through the chat if you absolutely need to step away. It's OK to disagree, but please be respectful. We want to hear from everyone. Really want your personal opinions and perspectives, even - especially! - if they aren't the same as everyone else's.
