Enzyme Office Spaces adds 1 lakh square feet of managed workspace in Whitefield, Bengaluru Ashish Agarwal, Co-founder & CEO of Enzyme Office Space, said, \"These spaces will play a pivotal role in supporting emerging startups from the fintech, artificial intelligence, cyber security, data science, and SAAS domains in the city who are looking for cost-effective infrastructural solutions to focus on their core business\". Scientists use AI to develop better, simpler COVID-19 tests \"We are trying to build a home-based test that is as reliable as a lab-based test,\" said Piyush Jain, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Florida (UF) in the US. A database of 200 million-plus protein shapes is hypercharging biomedical research So far, scientists have been using X-ray crystallography to find out the shape of proteins. This is expensive and time-consuming. Of course, AlphaFold's forecasts would need to be confirmed the old-fashioned way. But the time taken to confirm a hypothesis, already given to you, is far less than what is spent on forming alternate hypotheses.
