Similar to Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurveda is based on a life force and the pursuit of balance between the body, mind and nature. Ayurvedic practitioners' goal is to bring about well-being, prevent disease and ensure harmony of body and mind by aligning patients' lifestyles with their personal characteristics and medical histories. In Ayurvedic medicine, illness is believed to be the absence of physical, emotional and spiritual harmony. Certain aspects of this healing system, such as meditation, massage and yoga, have been shown to enhance quality of life, reduce stress and tension as well as improve general well-being. What are the benefits of Ayurveda? The main emphasis of the Ayurvedic lifestyle system is to prevent disease and maintain good health for the mind, body and spirit. Laboratory and clinical studies in the USA have suggested that some Ayurvedic herbal preparations may have the potential to prevent and treat certain cancers. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) have even added several Ayurvedic herbal compounds to its list of potential anticancer agents and has funded a series of laboratory studies to evaluate two Ayurvedic herbal remedies. However, it is early stages and until further research is done the American Cancer Society urges cancer patients to treat their disease with proven methods of treatment and to use Ayurvedic health principles, such as yoga, meditation and counseling in conjunction with conventional cancer care. Ayurveda in Bali Ayurvedic treatments differ from the majority of conventional cures by treating the sick instead of the sickness. Rather than trying to cure a disease in isolation, Ayurveda takes into account you in all your entirety.

The 3 Ayurvedic Doshas: Ayurveda draws on the elements of nature\u2014the Panchamahabhuts: kshit (earth), ap (water), marut(air), tejas (fire), and vyoma (space or ether or akash), are also, the components of the human body, which are manifested in 3 types of physic\u2014kaph (water/earth), pitta (fire), vata (ether/ air). These 3 types are further recognized by Ayurveda as 3 doshas: vata, pitta and kapha irregularities. The smooth functioning of the body is hampered owing to the imbalances in the 3 doshas (prakriti) causing all kinds of diseases. VATA Vata prakriti control all types of movements and is responsible for respiration too. This is the kinetic force in all kinds of biological forms, and controls the body's auto-functions (nerve impulses, circulation, respiration, and elimination and heartbeats etc.) therein. In case of an imbalance, vata individuals, who are quick in their mental process and initiation of action, tend to suffer from diseases of the neurological system especially motor functions. The diseases are pronounced during the old age, which is the period of vata (vata kala). The disease mostly affects the lower parts of the body since they are the predominant seats of vata dosha. PITTA Pitta Prakriti is consists the element of heat energy. It is responsible for maintenance of body heat and transforming in nature. All types of outside elements an individual takes-in are transformed into inside elements (microcosm) of the body by pitta. It governs the digestion or proper assimilation of physical, mental and emotional elements of a biological entity. Hence, Pitta is responsible for metabolism in the organ and tissue systems, as well as cellular metabolism. The persons of this prakriti are sharp, quick in action and normally possess a very good intellect as well as grasping power. The pitta prakriti persons are prone to diseases of the digestive and metabolic systems. The diseases mostly affect the abdomen i.e. the area between the chest and umbilicus. Also, pitta disorders are pronounced in the middle ages, which is the period of pitta (pitta kala). KAPHA Kapha prakriti or dosha consists of prithvi (earth) and jala (water). Jala or ap, is essential for sustenance of life. Prithvi, or earth, is responsible for structure and bulk of the material. Kapha is responsible for body form and structure (fluids, fats, bones and muscles). The kapha prakriti typically gives individuals a good physic and strong perseverance but they can be slow in their activities. The cold quality of kapha results in poor appetite as their agni or digestion is poor. In case of an imbalance (vikruti), people with a kapha dosha tend to suffer from the diseases of the respiratory system especially phlegmatic disorders. The diseases normally affects the upper parts of the body i.e. chest and above. The diseases are pronounced during the early ages (childhood), which is the period of kapha (kapha kala). Generally, it is normal that you can be a combination of 2 doshas when you take an Ayurvedic test. A practitioner will formulate a diet plan and recommend herbs for you and will take into consideration all these aspects and percentages of each dosha imbalances. That's why in Ayurveda, different people with the same disease sometimes receive different diet and herb plans as Ayurvedic medicine takes into consideration the body, mind and soul of an individual as the unit for diagnosis (the sick over the sickness). Recognizing the individuals doshas and tailoring the necessary treatment to that dosha to balance the mind and body equilibrium for ultimate health and wellbeing.
