Legislative Requirements and Key Terms Appendix B: Terrorism Deaths, Injuries, and Kidnappings of U.S. Citizens Foreword Since September 11, 2001, the United States has established a strong and sophisticated counterterrorism enterprise to reduce the threat of large -scale terrorist attacks on the homeland. Twenty -one years later, the terrorist threats we face are more ideologically diverse and geographically diffuse than ever before. At the same time, the United States is confronting a dynamic range of national security challenges, including strategic compe tition, cybersecurity threats, and climate change. Therefore, to confront evolving and emerging terrorist threats within the context of broader national security priorities, the United States is entering a new era of counterterrorism, one increasingly roo ted in diplomacy, partner capacity building, and prevention, and recognizing successful counterterrorism efforts require use of the full range of counterterrorism tools and a whole -of government and whole -of-society counterterrorism approach. In 2021, the United States and its partners continued to make major strides against terrorist organizations under this new framework, bolstering diplomatic and multilateral engagements and partner capacity building efforts. Through U.S. leadership, the Global Coaliti on to Defeat ISIS (Defeat -ISIS) raised more than $600 million in pledges to support stabilization projects in liberated areas of Iraq and Syria and established the Africa Focus Group (AFFG) to provide a mechanism for direct engagement with African Coalitio n members on addressing the threat of ISIS affiliates on the African continent. The United States designated three ISIS -Khorasan (ISIS -K) leaders, including Emir Sanaullah Ghafari, as Specially Designated Global Terrorists, in response to the August attac k on Kabul International Airport, which killed at least 185 people \u2014 including 13 U.S. servicemembers supporting evacuation operations \u2014 and injured more than 150 others. The United States also completed nine designations against al -Qa'ida (AQ) -linked ind ividuals and entities and offered a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to the location or identification of Abu Ubaydah Yusuf al-Anabi, the leader of the terrorist organization AQ in the Islamic Maghreb. Additionally, the United States inc reased diplomatic engagement across the globe to counter Iran -backed Hizballah's destabilizing activities, with more countries using their national authorities to designate, ban, or otherwise restrict the terrorist organization. The United States released its first-ever National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism , which includes a focus on transnational Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremism (REMVE). To that end, the United States, in partnership with the United Kingdom and the Interna tional Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law (IIJ), launched the first -ever criminal justice practitioner's guide on countering REMVE. The United States, partnering with Norway, also launched a Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF) effort to develop a GCTF REMVE Toolkit for policymakers and practitioners that will build on the IIJ's REMVE guide. Despite key counterterrorism successes, terrorist groups remained resilient and active. ISIS continued to promote a large -scale terrorism campaign, responding to increased counterterrorism pressure by adapting its tactics and techniques. Groups affiliated with ISIS ramped up activities in the Lake Chad Region of Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria. Despite losing its territorial \"caliphate\" in 2019, ISIS in Ir aq and Syria maintained a significant operational structure and conducted terrorist operations in that region. In 2021, AQ and its affiliates constituted an enduring threat to the United States and its allies. AQ continued to leverage its branches in the Middle East and Africa \u2014 notably AQ in the Arabian Peninsula, al -Shabaab, and Jama'at Nasr al -Islam wal Muslimin \u2014 that remain quite capable of inflicting damage on our allies and targeting our interests. AQ -related threats expanded from West Africa and the Sahel into the Gulf of Guinea littoral states in 2021, with Benin, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Togo reporting te rrorist group activity and attacks in their northern border regions. In Afghanistan, ISIS, elements of AQ, and regionally focused terrorist groups maintained an active presence and conducted terrorist activities. Despite taking significant losses from U.S. and NATO forces in recent years, ISIS -K continued to conduct terrorist attacks against civilians and the Taliban. ISIS -K remained a resilient enemy with roughly 2,000 to 3,000 fighters in the country, although precise estimates are hard to determine. AQ and its regional affiliate AQ in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) continued to have a presence in Afghanistan. Haqqani Network members and key leaders also have assumed formal and informal roles within the Taliban. Although the Taliban committed to prev enting terrorist groups from using Afghanistan to stage attacks against the United States or others, the extent of its ability and willingness to prevent AQ and ISIS -K from mounting external operations remained unclear. Iran continued to be the leading s tate sponsor of terrorism, facilitating a wide range of terrorist and other illicit activities around the world. Regionally, Iran supported acts of terrorism in Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen through proxies and partner groups such as Hizballah and Hamas. Additionally, senior AQ leaders continued to reside in Iran and engaged with other AQ elements from the country. Globally, the Ministry of Intelligence and Security remained Iran's primary actor involved in supporting terrorist recruitment, fi nancing, and plots across Africa, Asia, Europe, and North and South America. Iran also maintained a near-global procurement network, obtaining cutting -edge technology from companies and locales around the world to bolster its terrorist and military capabi lities. REMVE remained a threat to the United States and our allies. Violent white supremacists and like -minded individuals continued to promote violent extremist narratives, recruit new adherents, raise funds, and conduct terrorist activities \u2014 both on line and offline \u2014 across Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States. REMVE actors also continued to exploit the COVID -19 pandemic to radicalize individuals and incite violence, particularly against health professi onals, government officials, and minority populations. Additionally, the December arrest of four neo -Nazi actors in Brazil for allegedly plotting an attack against Jewish and Black residents on New Year's Eve demonstrates the growing reach and influence o f REMVE adherents globally. As terrorist threats morphed and metastasized, the United States adapted its counterterrorism approach and marshalled international efforts to counter global terrorism. In 2021, the United States supported the listing of two i ndividuals to the UN Security Council's 1267 ISIL/Da'esh and al -Qa'ida Sanctions Committee and three individuals to the 751 Somalia Sanctions Committee; these were the first three additions to the 751 Somalia Sanctions Committee since 2018. The UN also li sted ISIS -Tunisia (aka JAK -T) at the 1267 Sanctions Committee, bringing the total number of ISIS affiliates listed at the UN since 2019 to seven. In December the United States co -chaired a political director -level meeting of Defeat -ISIS Coalition members that also included an inaugural meeting of the AF FG, an endeavor the United States co -leads with Italy, Morocco, and Niger to counter ISIS networks in the sub -Sahara region. At this meeting, the Defeat -ISIS Coalition welcomed Burkina Faso as its 84th memb er. Further, the United States continued to make notable gains in a high -level diplomatic campaign to counter Hizballah's terrorist and other illicit activities. In May, Austria banned the use or display of any Hizballah -related symbols, building on the previous ban that was limited to symbols of Hizballah's so -called military wing. In November, Australia announced its intention to expand its domestic designation of Hizballah by declaring the group in its entirety a terrorist organization. Through U.S. diplomatic efforts, 15 countries have now designated, banned, or otherwise restricted Hizballah, applying their national authorities over the past several years. The United States prioritized multilateral engagements to advance its counterterrorism priori ties, bolster partner capacity to implement international obligations and commitments, and promote greater burden sharing. To maintain international momentum on the use of battlefield evidence to investigate and prosecute terrorism cases, the United State s and the IIJ co -hosted a UN General Assembly side event in September that brought together more than 100 criminal justice practitioners and senior policy officials from around the world to highlight recent advances in collection, exploitation, and interna tional sharing. In September, the 30-member GCTF adopted a Strategic Vision for the Next Decade and new framework documents that provide the international community with tools to prevent terrorist travel and enhance border security measures; address terro rist financing related challenges; and develop capacity to investigate and prosecute terrorist actors. Similarly, the United States led the successful negotiation of UNSCR 2617 (2021), which was unanimously adopted in December and renewed the UN Counterte rrorism Committee Executive Directorate mandate for another four years, preserving all precedent text related to the protection of human rights, inclusion of civil society, and importance of rule of law -based approaches. The United States also leveraged other multilateral organizations such as NATO, INTERPOL, OSCE, OAS, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Council of Europe, the IIJ, and Hedayah. Additionally, the United States continued to bolster partner capabilities to detect, disrupt, and dismantle terrorist networks . The United States supported partner governments on the front lines against terrorist threats in critical areas, including information sharing, aviation and border security, law enforcement investigations and pros ecutions, and countering the finance of terrorism, leading to real -world results that advanced shared security national security interests and protected the U.S. homeland. To restrict terrorist travel, the United States also signed two new and expanded ar rangements under Homeland Security Presidential Directive 6 to share information on known and suspected terrorists, bringing the total number of partner countries to over 75. Under the Watchlisting Assistance and Support Program, the United States provide d capacity building for countries to develop terrorist watchlists and exchange terrorist identity information. The Personal Identification Secure Comparison and Evaluation System (PISCES) border security platform grew to include 227 ports of entry in 23 c ountries, with international partners using it to screen hundreds of thousands of travelers each day and disrupt terrorist travel. Through capacity building efforts, the United States also emphasized to its partners the critical responsibility of governments engaged in counterterrorism operations to ensure that their security forces' respect international human rights and humanitarian law. The United States also stressed the importance of partner governments' holding their security forces accountable for violations and abuses committed against civilians during these counterterrorism operations. Another major line of effort in 2021 was facilitating the repatriation, rehabilitation, reintegration, and prosecution of ISIS FTFs and family members, where appropriate. About 2,000 non -Syrian and non -Iraqi FTFs remain in detention facilities controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) an d some 56,000 associated family members from more than 60 countries remain in displaced persons' camps across northeastern Syria. The only durable solution for this complex security and humanitarian crisis is the repatriation, rehabilitation, reintegratio n, and, where appropriate, prosecution of these populations. To ensure that ISIS fighters and family members captured by the SDF never return to the battlefield, the United States continued to lead by example in bringing back its citizens and prosecuting them when applicable. As of December the United States had repatriated 30 U.S. citizens from Syria and Iraq \u2014 13 adults and 17 children \u2014 and the Department of Justice charged 10 of the adults with a variety of terrorism -related crimes. The United States also urged other countries to repatriate, rehabilitate, reintegrate, and prosecute their citizens and assisted several countries in doing so with their citizens or nationals. Furthermore, the United States continued to promote a whole -of-government, whol e-of- society approach to prevent and counter violent extremism by engaging with governments, local religious leaders, and tech companies. The Department of State supported international initiatives, including the Strong Cities Network and the Global Commu nity Engagement & Resilience Fund, and concentrated on building local resiliency to terrorist radicalization, recruitment, and mis/disinformation, including in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kenya, Somalia, Tunisia, the Sahel, and the Western Balkans. The United States also advanced international efforts by engaging the Global Internet Forum to Counterterrorism and endorsing the Christchurch Call to Action to Eliminate Terrorist and Violent Extremist Content Online to support voluntary collaboration with technolog y companies to address terrorist and violent extremis m, including REMVE, content online. In September, the United States engaged with Twitter, Facebook, and Google/YouTube senior representatives to discuss the digital security of Afghan nationals with U.S . connections who may be targeted by the Taliban and other designated terrorist groups in Afghanistan. This constitutes a brief overview of the United States' ongoing work to protect our people from the ongoing threat of terrorism. Country Reports on Ter rorism 2021 provides a detailed review of last year's successes and the ongoing challenges facing our country and our partners, challenges that will require a continued commitment to and investment in global counterterrorism efforts going forward.

Country Reports on Terrorism AFRICA Overview: Terrorist groups primarily aligned with AQ and ISIS conducted attacks against civilians, humanitarian workers, government personnel and facilities, and security forces, which resulted in deaths, injuries, abductions, and the capture and destruction of pr operty across Sub- Saharan Africa during 2021. Terrorists routinely manipulated intercommunal disputes by supporting longstanding claims against other groups to gain support for terrorist operations. These actors continued to carry out attacks on military outposts; kidnap or attack western private citizens and humanitarian workers; attack churches, mosques, and schools teaching western curricula; and assassinate civil servants and politicians. African countries, as well as regional and multinational organ izations, sustained counterterrorism efforts against terrorist groups throughout 2021. In East Africa, AQ -affiliate al-Shabaab (AS) retained access to recruits, the ability to raise and manage substantial resources, and de facto control over large parts of Somalia through which it moved freely and launched high-profile, sophisticated attacks on civilians, government personnel and facilities, and security forces, including Somali and African Union peacekeeping operations. ISIS-linked fighters in East Afr ica continued to conduct small -scale local attacks. In Central Africa, ISIS -linked fighters conducted attacks primarily against civilians and security forces in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda. In the Lake Chad region, ISIS -West Africa and Boko Haram (BH) continued to conduct attacks primarily in Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon , and Niger. In the Sahel region, terrorist groups continued their operations in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. These included al -Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb continued operations in northern Mozambique and ISIS -linked facilitation networks continued alleged activity in S outh Africa. The United States continued to support partners across affected regions of Sub -Saharan Africa in their efforts to build counterterrorism capacity in areas including aviation and border security, improving regional security forces, countering terrorist finance, advancing criminal justice sector reforms, and training and mentoring of law enforcement to manage crisis response and conduct investigations. African partners undertook efforts to develop and expand regional cooperation mech anisms to detect and interdict terrorist travel and other terrorism -related activities. BURKINA FASO Overview: Terrorist attacks increased in 2021, compared with 2020. The Global Terrorism Index ranked Burkina Faso as the country fourth -most affected by terrorism in 2021, after Afghanistan, Iraq, and Somalia. JNIM continues to be the most prominent terrorist group in Burkina Faso, followed by ISIS -GS and the homegrown Ansaroul Islam. According to the Armed Conflict Location and E vent Data Project, the country registered 597 security incidents with 1,073 fatalities and an estimated 1.6 million internally displaced persons in 2021. Those attacks included armed attacks, abductions, carjackings, IEDs, vehicle -borne IEDs, rocket attac ks, and ambushes. The most -affected regions in Burkina Faso are the Sahel, Nord, Centre -Nord, and Est. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: Defense and security forces, civilians, humanitarian workers, religious, political, traditional, and community figures have all been victims of terrorist attacks: On May 3, armed militants attacked the village of Kodyel in the eastern Komandjari province. Homes were burned. At least 30 people were killed, and another 20 were wounded. On June 5, 160 people were killed, including 20 children, when gunmen stormed the Solhan Commune in the Yagha province along the northern border with Niger. On August 18, groups affiliated with ISIS -GS attacked a convoy made up of civilians who left Dori heading to Arbinda, under the escort of Defense and Security Forces and Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland (VDPs) in the Sahel region. Thirty civilians, 14 gendarmes, and three VDPs were killed in the attack. On November 14, JNIM militants attacked the gendarmerie detachm ent at Inata resulting in the deaths of 57 people, including 54 gendarmes. The incident provoked protests throughout the country about the authorities' failure to curb the years -long conflict. On December 23, Islamist insurgents attacked a convoy escorte d by VDPs in the Centre - Nord region. About 41 people were killed, including a beloved national icon of the fight against terrorism. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The state of emergency declared in six regions and 14 provinces since 2019 has been again extended by the Parliament until late 2022. Burkina Faso's Defense and Security Forces are augmented by VDPs units. The country's specialized counterterrorism units are the Army Special Forces, the Special Legion of National Gendarme rie, and the Multipurpose Intervention Unit of National Police. The Brigade Sp\u00e9ciale des Investigations Antiterroristes (BSIAT, Special Anti -Terrorism Investigation Brigade) refers cases to the specialized counterterrorism court for prosecution. The court held the only trials from August 9 to 13, convicting five persons of terrorism and acquitting one. On October 6, the Council of Ministers adopted the National Counterterrorism Strategy and the National Security Policy to combat terrorism by defining new strategic imperatives. Burkina Faso has 21 border police stations. The country uses border security systems sponsored by the IOM to help collect, store, and analyze travelers' information. In 2021, INTERPOL Burkina increased the use of terrorist and criminal screening watchlists. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Trafficking of illicit goods (in coordination with organized criminal groups), robberies, kidnappings, and illegal gold mining remain terrorist groups' primary sources of funding. In December, a Ouagadougou tribunal, with the assistance of the Financial Intelligence Unit, sentenced 39 individuals for fuel smuggling and endangering the lives of persons. The defendants also were accused of supplying fuel to terrorists; those allegat ions were transferred to the counterterrorism court for further investigations. Countering Violent Extremism: In January, a ministry in charge of national reconciliation and social cohesion was created as part of the Government of Burkina Faso's efforts to counter violent extremism and radicalization. On May 10, a workshop was held in Ouagadougou to validate the national strategy for the prevention of radicalization to violence and the fight against violent extremism and its action plan. This st rategy, developed with the support of USAID, aims to provide the Government of Burkina Faso with effective policies to fight against radicalization to violence and violent extremism, considering all the actors contributing to the expansion of the phenomeno n and proposing adequate and sustainable solutions to population resilience. International and Regional Cooperation: Burkina Faso continues its participation in the G -5 Sahel, along with Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger. The country is also part of th e Accra Initiative with Benin, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Togo. Mali and Niger are observer members. The Accra Initiative is a cooperative and collaborative security mechanism aimed at preventing the spillover of terrorism from the Sahel and addressing tra nsnational organized crime and violent extremism in member countries' border areas. Burkina Faso became the 84th member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS in November. CAMEROON Overview: In 2021, terrorist activity decreased in the Far North Region. The NGO Stand Up for Cameroon reported that Boko Haram and ISIS -West Africa (ISIS -WA) killed 339 people in 2021, compared to an estimated 400 people in 2020, a 15 percent decline in fataliti es. Attribution for the attacks is contested in the public sphere. Terrorists appeared to have intensified attacks on military targets , compared with attacks on civilians; however, terrorists continued to attack civilians, which caused many to abandon their villages. As of December 31 , the United Nations High Commission for Refugees had identified 358,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 117,000 refugees in the Far North Region in need of humanitarian assistance because of terrorist activity. Thousands of terrorists and associated family members surrendered and joined disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) centers after the death of Boko Ha ram leader Abubakar Shekau in May. The government facilitated the voluntary repatriation of about 2,000 ex- combatants and their families back to Nigeria from a DDR center in September. The Cameroon government began constructing a DDR center to host 1,500 ex-combatants in November and facilitated the voluntary return of 7,900 displaced persons to Nigeria in 2021. Cameroon continued its counterterrorism cooperation with support from the international community. Over the course of the year, Cameroon participated in operations of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) and remained a member of the Trans -Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership and the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. Countering terrorist threats remained a top security priority for the Government of Cameroon. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: Attacks included raids in search of supplies, indiscriminate killings, targeted murders, beheadings, suicide bombings, abductions, arsons, and lootings. A representative sample of the deadlie st attacks in the Far North Region included the following: On January 8, Boko Haram suicide bombers killed 13 civilians in Mozogo. On March 18, Boko Haram terrorists killed two civilians and burned at least 52 homes in Kangaleri. During July 24 -27, IS IS-WA terrorists in military vehicles killed 13 soldiers and wounded several others in Sagme and Zigue. On August 30, ISIS -WA terrorists kidnapped 15 fishermen in Blangoua. On October 6, Boko Haram terrorists shot and killed seven civilians in Assighass ia. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Cameroon continued to use the 2014 antiterrorism law to prosecute suspected terrorists, but also to suppress dissent and arrest activists. In June, human rights lawyer Nicodemus Amungwa was impris oned on charges of inciting terrorism. Countering Financing of Terrorism: There were n o changes since 2020. Countering Violent Extremism: During September 21 -24, the IOM and the government trained 30 participants on planning, implementation, and coordination of DDR programs and ways to increase women and youth engagement in the project framework. Training was provided within the context of the Lake Chad Basin Reg ional Stabilization Strategy to improve recovery and resiliency in terrorist -affected areas. In September , the Rapid Intervention Battalion gave books and supplies to 300 students and teachers in Bodo, Far North Region, as part of a \"Get Back to School\" program to promote education in areas affected by terrorist attacks. In 2021 , the United Nations Popula tion Fund, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the IOM supported victims of Boko Haram and ISIS -WA through a project to promote social cohesion, facilitate economic recovery, and support the local government in Mayo -Sava, Mayo - Tsanaga, and Logone -et-Chari, the three most -affected divisions in the Far North Region. In 2021 , the government invested $10 million to rebuild infrastructure destroyed by Boko Haram. In October , the government launched the reconstruction of markets, security posts, and schools that terrorists in Amchide, Far North Region , had destroyed. The UNDP performed the reconstruction under the Lake Chad Basin Regional Stabilization Strategy. The govern ment facilitated the surrender of thousands of terrorists and their family members and provided food and accommodations for ex -combatants at DDR centers. It hosted at least 1,500 ex-combatants and their families at the DDR center in Meri and transformed m any public buildings along the border with Nigeria into temporary DDR housing. In September , the government eased the voluntary repatriation of an estimated 1,993 ex -combatants and their families to Nigeria. From January through March , the government fac ilitated the voluntary repatriation of 7,900 refugees at the camp in Minawao, Far North Region. In November , the government began constructing a $2.6 million DDR center in Meme, Far North Region , that is expected to host at least 1,500 ex -combatants. In May, National DDR Coordinator Francis Fai Yengo organized a seminar to explain the DDR process to stakeholders, including ex -combatants, security officers, administrative authorities, and host c ommunities. Local languages Mandara and Kanuri were available during the seminar. The organizers urged ex -combatants and ex -associates at the DDR center to encourage other terrorists to drop their weapons. The Inclusive Economic and Social Recovery Pro gram for Lake Chad (RESILAC) , funded by the European Union and the French Development Agency , promoted social cohesion between IDPs and local communities in the Far North Region. RESILAC created jobs and supported agricultural entrepreneurship. In 2021 , the State Department funded 13 civil society organizations to support locally led efforts in the Far North Region to prevent violent extremism as well as a project to strengthen social cohesion through trust -building activities between local communities a nd security forces. International and Regional Cooperation: There were n o changes since 2020. CHAD Overview: In 2021, Chadian President D \u00e9by was killed during a battlefield engagement with rebels ; the Transitional Military Council that assumed control after the longtime president's death has maintained Chad's prior commitments to regional counterterrorism efforts. Chad has experienced persistent terrorist threats in the border areas near populatio n centers surrounding Lake Chad but suffered only two attacks against military and civilian targets in 2021, both in the Lake Chad region. Security forces and basic government services remained under resourced , which limited the Chadian government's abil ity to address all security concerns, but Chadian armed forces led missions within the Sahel to contribute to regional security. Chad maintained a strong commitment to fight terrorists: deploying soldiers to Mali to support the UN Multidimensional Integr ated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) , supporting the Lake Chad region's MNJTF , and committing forces to the G-5 Sahel Joint Force. Chad continued to host the French Task Force Barkhane, France's CT mission to the Sahel. The United States has historically been the largest direct supporter of capacity building for Chadian security forces and has benefited from Chad's contributions to regional security and the counterterrorism efforts that this support has enabled. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: BH and ISIS -WA continued attacks around the eastern and northern shores of Lake Chad : On August 5, BH assailants killed 26 Chadian soldiers and wounded 14 others while on patrol near Tchoukoutalia before the Chadian army repulsed the attackers. A September attack by BH on Kadjigoroum in the Lake Chad region 20 kilometers from Baga Sola killed nine civilians before assailants set the village on f ire. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Chad's Special Anti -Terrorism Group Division is the primary military force deployed to fight terrorism in Lake Chad Basin and across the Sahel. The Director General of National Police remained supportive of U.S. CT efforts. The National Police selected a group of law enforcement officers from multiple agencies to form a new CT investigation unit specifically designed to operate in the Lake Chad region. The program has been restarte d after impacts from COVID -19, and the National Police increased the size of the unit. Securing borders remains challenging. Porous borders, particularly across Lake Chad, provide easy passage for terrorists and criminal entities. Border security rem ained a shared task of the Gendarmes, Army, Customs, and the National and Nomadic Guard (GNNT), none of which is resourced sufficiently. In November , the government announced amnesty for 296 Chadian rebels and opposition members charged with a range of i nfractions , including \"crimes of opinion, terrorism, and threats to the integrity of the state ,\" as a confidence -building measure preceding government negotiations with rebel groups (known as political -military groups in Chadian political vocabulary). Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Chad's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the National Agency for Financial Investigation (ANIF), is a member of the Egmont Group. ANIF requested Antiterrorism Assi stance (yet unallocated) for training new analysts to combat financial crime and antiterrorism financing. Chad is a member of the Task Force on Money Laundering in Central Africa. Countering Violent Extremism: Chad actively opposed violent extremism. The High Council of Islamic Affairs promoted peaceful coexistence and tolerance, and diverse faith groups utilized the Interfaith Dialogue Commission to engage in mitigat ing conflict. The national coordination office for the G-5 Sahel maintained its radicalization prevention unit, stood up in 2020, which initiates coordination meetings of CVE practitioners. International and Regional Cooperation: Chad engaged actively in the following CT organizations: UN MNJTF G-5 Sahel Lake Chad Basin Commission Surrounded by conflict, Chad is a leader in exporting security forces to contribute to regional stability in the Sahel. Chad contributed 1,425 soldiers to Mali as part of MINUSMA; 2,000 soldiers in support of the MNJTF; and 650 soldiers in northern Chad as part of the G-5 Sahel Joint Force East Zone Headquarters . Chad also deployed 1,200 soldiers to the Liptako -Gourma tri-border region between Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger as part of the G-5 Sahel Joint Force. Chad also supports the Chad -Sudan Mixed Force by contributing 600 soldiers as part of the joint border security effort with Sudan. In December , the Government of Chad announced its desire to increase the Chadi an MINUSMA contingent by an additional 1,000 Chadian Peacekeepers , and this request is still pending review and approval from the United Nations Security Council. While this proposal still awaits implementation, it underscores the importance that Chad pl aces on contributing to regional security. N'Djamena hosts the headquarters of the five -nation ( Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria) MNJTF, which was formed to counter the threat posed by ISIS -WA, al -Qa'ida, and BH in the Lake Chad region. N'Djamena also hosts France's largest operational military deployment in the world, Task Force Barkhane, which provides French military planners with a strategic command position while it reevaluates the array of French forces throughout the Sahel . Chad has received security resource support from China, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, T\u00fcrkiye , and the European Union in the past, and continued resource shortfalls are forcing Chad to reassess its need for military capabilities to address encroach ing security challenges. C\u00d4TE D' IVOIRE Overview: C\u00f4te d'Ivoire was added to the 2021 Country Report on Terrorism because a significant increase in attacks from violent extremists in the North spill ed over the porous border from Burkina Faso. The Government of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire assesses the Macina Liberation Front (aka Katiba the al -Qa'ida affiliate Jam a'at Nusr at al-Islam wal -Muslim in (JNIM), to be responsible for the attacks. JNIM exploits tensions between ethnic communities and is trying to expand into coastal West Africa. Thus far, JNIM has successfully targeted Ivoirian security forces in the far North, with more than 20 casualties resulting from numerous of attacks. Separately, according to open -source reporting, some members of the large Lebanese community in C\u00f4te d'Ivo ire provide financial support to Hizballah. The Ivoirian government demonstrates a strong commitment to preventing the spread of violent extremism by strengthening ties to the population through training and equipping , delivering public services, investin g in infrastructure, and improving communication. The Government of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is prioritizing investments in special units dedicated to investigating and countering terrorist activity. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: The following terrorist incidents occurred in 2021 : On March 21, unidentified gunmen surrounded and attacked a military base , killing two in Kafolo , Savanes region (north), and used similar tactics in Tehini , Zanzan region (northern C\u00f4te d 'Ivoire), to kill one. On April 12, in a r ural area of Savanes region (north) , a gendarmerie detonated an IED planted by unidentified terrorists. There were no reports of casualties. On June 10, also in a r ural area of Savanes regions (north) , the Armed Forces of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (FACI ) repulsed an attack on a rural military base that killed 12 soldiers and wounded seven others. FACI killed one assailant. On October 19, gunmen attacked a police station in Tehini, wounding one officer before FACI rep ulsed the attack. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and the United Nations Office for Counterterrorism signed a n MOU on June 3 , under the CT -Travel Program , to prevent and detect terrorist travel through advance information about airline pass engers. The Government of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire passed the Ivoirian Anti -Terrorism Act No. 2015 -493 in 2015. This legislation remains in effect. Under this law, individuals convicted of terrorist activity may be sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison and fined up to CFA 50 million. There are seven law enforcement units responsible for counterterrorism efforts: the Brigade Anti-terroriste, the Centre de Coordination des D\u00e9cisions Op\u00e9rationelles, the Force de Recherche et d'Assistance, the Unit\u00e9 Lutte contre le de Traitement des Informations Financi\u00e8res, the Police Criminelle, and the Police Economique. The Government of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire created the Counter terrorism Operational Intelligence Cent er (or CROAT) under the dual supervision of the National Security Council and the Ministry of Defense. The security forces conducted several operations in response to the terrorist threat throughout the year. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is developing the expertise and body of laws required to successfully detect, preve nt, and prosecute cases of terrorism financing. According to open -source research, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire allegedly is Hizb allah's primary center for fundraising within Africa, helped greatly by the country's sizeable community of established Lebanese families. The Government of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is part of the Intergovernmental Action Group Against Money Laundering in West Africa. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is developing a national strategy to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. Eight months a fter the terrorist attack on the tourist town of Grand Bassam (near Abidjan) in early 2016, the National Assembly passed the Anti -Money Laundering and Anti -Terrorist Financing Act . That same year, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire joined the African Development Bank's Partnership on Illicit Finance. The Cellule de Traitement des Informations Financi\u00e8res (Financial Information Treatment Cell) under the Ministry of Finance analyzes financial transactions and informs the banking sector of nonconforming ones. Countering Violent Extrem ism: In 2021 , the Ivoirian government expanded the use of community policing practices to counter violent extremist groups, particularly in the north of the country. Law enforcement personnel receive training on and are directed to implement the doctrine in partnership with civil society, religious, traditional, and other community -based groups to co -create safe communities. The Government of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire directed security forces to collabora te with local populations to enhance border security by reviving a traditional practice of having visitors register their presence in a village with the local chief. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is actively developing approaches to enhance cooperation with historical ly marginalized communities, most notable of which is the Peulh (Fulani) ethnic group. Local authorities are aware of the need to address longstanding mistrust and are actively working to implement training and community outreach. Nevertheless, there are allegations of security forces targeting Peuhl based on their ethnicity. International and Regional CT Cooperation : C\u00f4te d'Ivoire engaged actively in the following organizations: United Nations , member state UN Office of Counterterrorism (UNOCT) UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF) African Union , member state Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) , member state ECOWAS Chiefs of Defense Staff Committee , member state Accra Initiative , member state In June the Government of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire , in partnership with France, inaugurated the International Academy for the Fight Against Terrorism (AILCT) to improve domestic and regional efforts to holistically co mbat terrorism. The AILCT has three mutually reinforcing lines of effort: research, academic instruction, and tactical training. DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO Overview: More than a dozen significant armed groups and about 100 criminal gangs and local militias operate in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). ISIS maintains links with local affiliate ISIS -DRC, locally known as the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) , and Madin a at Tauheed Wau Mujahedeen . The United States designated ISIS -DRC as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in March 2021. Before pledging allegiance to ISIS in 2019, the ADF had operated in the eastern D emocratic Republic of the Congo for years. They are known for large -scale, systemic violence against civilians and asymmetric attacks against the Congolese Armed Forces (FARD C). In 2021, Democratic Republic of the Congo security forces arrested Burundian, Jordanian, Kenyan, Rwandan, Tanzanian, and Ugandan ISIS -DRC suspects , in addition to Congolese. 2021 Incidents: According to the UN, in 2021 ISIS -DRC allegedly injured at least 257 people, abducted 1,129, and killed at least 1,120 people, a 52 percent increase in such violence over 2020. ISIS-DRC primarily targets civilians in large -scale attacks, but it also target s the FARDC and UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (known as MONUSCO) Peacekeepers. In 2021 , there were notable changes in ISIS -DRC's tactics and weapons. The group's push north into Ituri Province and west in North Kivu Province throughout 2021 enlarged its operating area, making it less predictable and stretching Congolese security resources. Major attacks on main roads were intended to disrupt transit of goods, people, and security forces. While ISIS -DRC continued to use rudimentary IEDs in a defensive manner, in June the organization deployed multiple IEDs in Beni city, including its first suicide bombing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . These devices employed a more sophisticated design than previously seen, suggesting outside expertise. Since the onset of joint FARDC -Ugandan People 's Defense Forces (UPDF) military operations against ISIS -DRC on November 30, the group is believed to be operating in several decentralized and mobile groups. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The Democratic Republic of the Congo has no comprehensive CT legislation. Its National Assembly passed a draft CT bill in 2018 that stalled in the Senate. The Democratic Republic of the Congo shares some 6,835 miles of land, lake, and river borders with nine countries but lacks the capacity to effectively patrol them. The border authority, the Directorate General of Migration, uses the IOM Migration Information and Data Analysis System ( or MIDAS) at only a fraction of the Democratic Republic of the Congo 's more than 400 official border crossings. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: The government made efforts to strengthen its AML/CFT framework, although it still lacks resources and capacity. Notably, under new leadership, the Democratic Republic of the Congo 's Financial Intelligence Unit ( known as CENAREF) revitalized engagement with international partners. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a member of GABAC, the Task Force on Money Laundering in Central Africa. The Democratic Republic of the Congo government introduced a bill in 2021 to make the Democratic Republic of the Congo an Associate Member of the policy of CEMAC, the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa , on AML/CFT. Countering Violent Extremism: There were no significant changes in 202 1. International and Regional Cooperation: The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a member of the Global D efeat -ISIS Coalition and participated in the June D efeat -ISIS Ministerial in Rome, and the December Africa Focus Group meeting in Brussels. In late November, President Tshisekedi authorized the UPDF to intervene in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo to combat ISIS -DRC and to conduct joint UPDF -FARDC operations. In 2021, the Democratic Republic of the Congo was a member of the Southern African Development Community and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region. President Tshisekedi held the annual rotating chairmanship of the African Union in 2021. DJIBOUTI Overview: The Republic of Djibout i remained a critical partner for the United States and the region in the fight against terrorism, and no terrorist incidents were reported in Djibouti in 2021. Since 2002, Djibouti has hosted Camp Lemonnier, the headquarters of AFRICOM's Combined Joint T ask Force -Horn of Africa and the only enduring U.S. military installation in Africa. Djiboutian law enforcement agencies continued to prioritize CT efforts throughout the country. As in previous years, Djiboutian government officials, particularly those in law enforcement and the Ministry of Islamic and Cultural Affairs, worked closely to identify and address terrorist activity. The Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) is the regional organization for the Greater Horn of Africa, headquarter ed in Djibouti. IGAD's Center of Excellence for Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism (ICEPCVE) provides training and resources to counter violent extremism throughout the region. Djibouti's armed forces deploy soldiers to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM ) campaign and will field their Rapid Intervention Battalion in FY 2024 with the task of rapid response and CT. 2021 Terrorist Attacks: There were no terrorist incidents reported in Djibouti in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Djibouti has a legal framework for prosecuting terrorism -related crimes and can try those charged of terrorism -related offenses in criminal courts, using its penal code. In 2020 , the Ministry of Justice issued life sentences to two accomplices in a 2014 suicide -bomber attack at a popular restaurant, La Chaumi\u00e8re . Djiboutian law enforcement agencies consist of the Djiboutian Police (DNP), the Djiboutian National Gendarmerie ( the Gendarmerie), the General Directorate for Services of Documentation and Security, and the Djiboutian National Coast Guard \u2014 all of which proactively detect, deter, and prevent acts of terrorism in the country. The DNP, the Gendarmerie, and the Coast Guard developed a biometric program that u ses handheld biometric capture devices, which can generate a DNA profile. Once populated, the Gendarmerie and Coast Guard DNA database can be searched for identity and limited familial (including paternal ) relationship s. Djibouti continued to enhance border security and deter terrorist travel, with security protocols and increased use of criminal databases such as INTERPOL's. The country also continued to conduct traveler screening and process travelers through ent ry and exit points at the international airport and seaports. Most travelers who enter Djibouti do so by land at one of four border points, one of them at the Somali -Djibouti border. Maritime travelers also enter at Obock, located on the north side of the Gulf of Tadjoura. Djiboutian law enforcement agencies coordinate their CT functions and information sharing. The DNP controls border checkpoints, with support from the Gendarmerie patrolling between border posts, and the country's armed forces are responsible for patrolling land borders in remote locations. To screen for potential security threats, law enforcement agencies also maintain checkpoints and conduct vehicle cordon -and-search operations on the way into and within the capital city. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Djibouti's FIU is Le Service de Renseignements Financiers (SRF). SRF oversees and enforces AML/CFT regulations. It conducted online trainings on detecting terrorism financing, including for financial institutions, to identify potential terrorism financing threats among their NGO account holders. The FIU also s igned MOUs with the Djibouti Tax Office and Djibouti Customs, intending to enhance cooperation between the two government agencies and SRF on countering terrorism financing. Djibouti is a member of the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Fo rce (MENAFATF), a FATF -style regional body. The country's proximity to Somalia and Yemen remains a risk factor for terrorism financing concerns , as many Djibouti -based financial institutions continue to operate in neighboring countries that have weak or no AML/CFT legislation or other financial controls. There were no published law enforcement cases involving suspected terrorism financing in 2021. Countering Violent Extremism: The Ministry of Justice continued to convene the National Antiterrorism Taskforce, consisting of a national commission of experts, including from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the ICEPCVE. The task force held several terrorism -related exercises on responses to and the prevention of terrorist attacks, enhancing protectio n of soft targets such as restaurants, hotels, and grocery stores. Although law enforcement measures constitute the bulk of Djibouti's national CT strategy, community engagement \u2014 including with youth, sports, culture, and civil society organizations \u2014 is an increasingly important feature of its CVE efforts. Law enforcement agencies continued to work with the High Islamic Council within the Ministry of Islamic and Cultural Affairs to identify and monitor activity that promoted violent extremism. Inter national and Regional Cooperation: Djibouti hosts IGAD's executive secretariat. Additionally, the IGAD ICEPCVE is based in Djibouti and provided training and resources on CVE throughout the region, including representatives from Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya , Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. The Djiboutian military continued its participation in AMISOM, which counts Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda as the other four Troop Contributing Countries. ETHIOPIA Overview: The Government of Ethiopia continued to partner with the United States government on counterterrorism issues in 2021, though in a diminished capacity owing to emerging domestic security threats. Al-Shabaab and ISIS terrorist threats emanating from Somalia remain a high priority for the National Intelligence and Security Service. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in Ethiopia in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: 2021 saw an increase in the number of allegations and charging decisions against domestic defendants cited under the Government of Ethiopia 's Anti -Terrorism Proclamation of 2019 , only to be quickly withdrawn, especially during a nationwide State of Emergency (SOE) that began in November 2021 and continued into 2022 . In some cases, the courts ruled against the Government of Ethiopia , dismissing criminal complaints altogether or gr anting outright bail to defendants. In May the Government of Ethiopia officially designated the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF ) and the Oromo Liberation Army ( OLA ) as terrorist organizations, a designation not shared by the U .S. government or the UN. On November 2 , Ethiopia proclaimed a nationwide SOE that gave the armed forces and law enforcement organizations expanded search, seizure, and arrest powers in cases involving known or suspected terrorist supporters. The SOE reportedly led to the arrest and detention of tens of thousands of Ethiopian citizens, in many cases simply because of their Tigrayan ethnicity or affiliation with Tigrayan persons. The Government of Ethiopia 's CT capacity decreased in 2021 , as resources were reassigned to counter growing threats from the OLA and the TPLF. However, the government continued to deploy CT units along Ethiopia's borders with Kenya and Somalia. Ethiopian aviation security made improvements to passenger and cargo security in 2021; however, lack of an effective access control sy stem remains a vulnerability. The insertion of biometric controlled access has enhanced terminal security, even though the airport system is not yet fully installed. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Ethiopia is a member of the Eastern and Southe rn Africa Anti -Money Laundering Group , and Ethiopia's FIU, the Ethiopian Financial Intelligence Centre, is a member of the Egmont Group. Countering Violent Extremism: The Government of Ethiopia 's CVE strategy focuses on eliminating factors that help al-Shabaab recruitment, including on reducing poverty and ethnic strife and on local mediation and conflict mitigation strategies to defuse ethnic and religious tensions . International and Regional Cooperation: Owing to allegations of a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights committed by Ethiopian government forces in the context of the conflict in northern Ethiopia, the United States has imposed wide -ranging restrictions on security assistance to the country . Ethiopia has been one of the largest troop - and police -contributing countries in UN and AU peacekeeping, though its contributions are declining. In Somalia, a significant portion of the 4,000 Ethiopian troops present under a bilateral agreement with the Federal Government of Somalia were recalled to Ethiopia to reinforce units engaged in the conflict in northern Ethiopia. As a result of the ongoing dispute with Sudan over the contested al -Fashaga border area, the UN agreed to replace roughly 3,200 Ethiopian Peacekeeper s assigned to the UN Interim Security Force for Abyei. About 1,500 Ethiopian Peacekeepers are deployed in support of the UN Mission in South Sudan, and some 3,800 Ethiopian Peacekeepers are deployed to Somalia in support of the AU peacekeeping mission. Ethiopia also participates in the IGAD and its CT programs and trainings, including the IGAD Security Sector Program, which builds regional capacity to mitigate, detect, and deter terrorist activity. KENYA Overview: In 2021, Kenya continued to suffe r terrorist attacks primarily along the Kenyan - Somali border. IEDs and ambushes targeting Kenyan security forces and important infrastructure were the primary means of attack. Indiscriminate IED attacks on roads u sed by Kenyan security forces have resulted in numerous additional civilian casualties. While Kenyan security forces were the principal targets, teachers and key infrastructure also were targeted. Though large -scale attacks decreased with the onset of COVID -19, possibly because of pandemic countermeasures such as travel restrictions and lockdowns, al -Shabaab has maintained a consistent operational tempo in the border region. A member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, Kenya plays a leading role in re gional CT cooperation. The Kenya Defense Forces (KDF) continued to participate in AMISOM and supported border security and counter -IED efforts within Kenya. Security services responded to numerous terrorist incidents, while also disrupting al -Shabaab and ISIS attack planning, recruitment, and travel. Reports of human rights violations and abuses by security forces during CT operations continued, including allegations of extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and torture. However, Kenyan securi ty forces demonstrated improved procedures regarding protection of human rights in response to terrorist threats and attacks. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: Terrorist incidents in 2021 included the following : On January 16, suspected al-Shabaab ( AS) operatives attacked the village of Waco Dadacha in Mandera, 150 kilometers from the Kenya -Somalia border. During the five - hour siege , one civilian was killed, one injured, and significant property damaged. On Marc h 24, four pe rsons were killed and 10 wounded (four critically ), when a bus operating between the cities of Lafey and Mandera hit an IED planted on a busy highway in Mandera County. On July 2, AS operatives killed three nonlocal construction workers and wo unded one in Dhobley, Garissa County , near the Somalia border. On October 12, six KDF personnel were wounded, one seriously, when their vehicle detonated an al -Shabaab IED in Lamu County. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Kenya's government continued to rely on the Prevention of Terrorism Act (amended in 2014) to investigate and prosecute terrorism. Crowded court dockets and the lack of continuous trials slowed progress on many terrorism proceedings. However, 2021 saw the opening of the U.S. -funded Kahawa Law Court in Nairobi. This secure courthouse is a dedicated resource for bringing suspected terrorists to trial and has heard numerous cases. Despite succes ses, challenges persist. Access to defense counsel for terrorism suspects is limited because the government has not fully funded the National Legal Aid Service. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has been working to develop a uniform and c onsistent nationwide policy on plea negotiations. The use of plea agreements could provide a mechanism for cooperation of lower -level accomplices against higher -level terrorism suspects. Both CT - focused prosecutors and judges have begun using plea agreem ents in proceedings. CT functions are divided among the three branches of the National Police Service: 1) the Kenya Police Service (including the paramilitary General Service Unit (GSU); the Traffic Police; and the regional, county, and local police); 2 ) the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (including the investigative Anti terrorism Police Unit, the Bomb Disposal Unit, and the Cyber Forensics Investigative Unit); and 3) the Administration Police (including the Border Police Unit). The National Intelligence Service, elements of the KDF, and the interagency also shared responsibility for CT functions. Uneven coordination, resource constraints, insufficient training, corruption, and unclear command and control continue to hinder CT ef fectiveness. Kenya's National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) continued to work with private security companies on preventing soft target attacks. Kenya's interagency Joint Terrorism Task Force began operations and made its first arrest on November 13. Kenyan officials continued to work to secure the nation 's porous land borders to prevent terrorist exploitation, but hurdles remain. While aviation safety and security at Nairobi's international airport and at several points of entry have improved with t he establishment of Joint Operations Centers, watchlist screening and basic equipment at smaller ports of entry were generally lacking. The Kenyan government worked to prevent the transit of foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs ), including Kenyans attemptin g to join AS or ISIS, and those returning from abroad. Kenyan security services also detected and deterred terrorist plots and responded to dozens of terrorism - related incidents. The Kenyan government cooperated on threat information and security at Emba ssy Nairobi , including through a dedicated GSU CT response team funded by the United States. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Kenya is a member of the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti -Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG). Kenya helped host a regiona l counterterrorism financing (CTF) meeting in Nairobi in November , during which Kenyan officials explored expanding CTF collaboration with their Djiboutian and Somali counterparts. Countering Violent Extremism: The NCTC's County Action Plans for CVE in all 47 counties continue to be the primary framework for U.S. and other international CVE programming at the local level, but implementation of action plans in many counties remained hampered by a lack of funding. Police in Nairobi, coastal, and northeastern counties participated in community engagement training and ea rly warning and response programs. Prison and justice sector stakeholders improved handling of terrorist suspects and convicts, and judicial officials worked to improve management of remand prisoners through plea bargaining and other methods. Kenya's sec ond largest city, Mombasa, is an active member of the Strong Cities Network. International and Regional Cooperation: Nairobi hosts the UN headquarters in Africa. The KDF continued its participation in AMISOM and is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. Although not a member, Kenya participated in regional meetings of the GCTF. MALI Overview: The transition government, installed following the 2020 coup d'\u00e9tat, undertook another extraconstitutional change in government on May 24, when military forces arrested transition President Bah N'Daw and transition Prime Minister Moctar Ouane. Assimi Goita, who led the 2020 coup and had served as vice president following it, subsequently assumed the transition government presidency. Mali's longstanding counterterrorism partnerships with foreign forces in country \u2014 particularly France's Operation Barkhane \u2014 experienced increased disruptions throughout 2021. In fall and winter of 2021, French troops withdrew to Gao from bases in Kidal, Tessalit, and Timbuktu. Barkhane handed the bases over to the Malian Armed Forces (FAMa). In a nod to its populist leanings, the transition government ratcheted up anti -France rhetoric in late 2021. In December, the Kremlin -backed Wagner Group deployed to Mali. The security vacuum created by the withdrawal of French and other international forces cannot be filled by Malian forces and Wagner Group forces. Terrorist activities increased in lethality throughout the country and continued to target civili ans, FAMa, international peacekeepers, and international military forces, with 1,826 fatalities recorded by Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project for 2021. Terrorist groups active in Mali include ISIS -GS and JNIM \u2014 an AQ -affiliated umbrella group that formed when the Sahara branch of AQIM, al -Murabitoun, Ansar al -Dine, and the Terrorist Incidents: JNIM and ISIS -GS continued to conduct terrorist attacks, primarily targeting Malian and international military fo rces. While attacks principally occurred in the central area of Mali, terrorist groups continued to press farther south along the Burkinabe border into the Sikasso Region. Additionally, attacks occurred along Mali's borders with C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Maurita nia, further enveloping Bamako and other population centers: On June 25, 13 MINUSMA peacekeepers were seriously injured during the largest suicide -vehicle -borne IED attack in recent memory against a temporary UN base near the village of Ichagara in the Ga o region. On August 8, Gunmen on motorcycles attacked several villages in a coordinated assault against several villages in the Gao region along the border with Niger, killing more than 50 civilians. A day later, across the country in Dioura, in southern -central Mali, terrorists killed 30 civilians, including 20 Dozo hunters, for refusing to pay religious \"taxes.\" JNIM claimed responsibility for a September 28 complex ambush against an Australian - owned gold mining convoy about 100 miles from Bamako. Five Gendarmerie Special Forces soldiers guarding the convoy were killed, and several vehicles were destroyed. In December, in the increasingly volatile central Mali area, at least 31 civilians were killed and 17 were wounded after gunmen attacked a bus en rout e to a market in Bandiagara. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There were no changes to Mali's counterterrorism legal framework in 2021. Plans for a massive legal overhaul in 2020 were suspended. Despite the delay of the criminal and procedure codes, 30 terrorism cases went to trial. The COVID -19 outbreak caused significant delays, which were exacerbated by the 2020 coup d'\u00e9tat and the May military consolidation of power. Mali's vast and porous borders extend some 4,500 miles and touch seven neighboring countries. The Gendarmerie and the National Border Police both provide security and law enforcement support to prevent and deter criminal activity at borders; however, both agencies are understaffed, are poorly trained, and lack es sential equipment and resources. Customs officials under the Ministry of Economy and Finance monitor the flow of goods and enforce customs laws at borders and ports of entry. Mali receives INTERPOL notices, but the INTERPOL database is unavailable outside of Bamako. Exit and entry stamps used by border officials have inconsistent size and shape, undermining efforts to authenticate travel documents. The government receives Public Key Infrastructure certificates for passport security inf ormation from the International Civil Aviation Organization; however, the information sharing is done manually and inconsistently. Security features for Malian passports remain unchanged. Imposters obtain fraudulent documents, such as birth and marriage certificates, with relative ease, undermining the veracity of Malian identification documents. The transition government has made little progress toward implementation of UN Security Council resolution 2396 regarding border security. Mali previously im plemented biometric fingerprint and facial recognition screening at established ports of entry. However, Mali has little or no control over its many and vast territorial borders, allowing terrorists to move across borders with ease. Countering the Finan cing of Terrorism: Mali is a member of the Intergovernmental Action Group Against Money Laundering in West Africa (GIABA), a financial action task force -style regional body. Mali's National Financial Intelligence Processing Unit is a member of the Egmont Group. Efforts to counter terrorism financing remain ineffective owing to lack of resources, training, basic auditing tools, and automation. Countering Violent Extremism: Despite the inclusion of armed group representatives in the transition governmen t, progress on the implementation of the 2015 Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali (the Algiers Accord) remains stymied. The transition government has not yet announced its strategy to combat violent extremism. As the ongoing French withdrawal proceeds, FAMa reports of widespread success against terrorist organizations remain difficult to verify and are likely untrue. International and Regional Cooperation: Since the May 24 consolidation of military power, Mali has grown increasingly insular, shirking its traditional partners in favor of rebuilding its relationship with Russia. Following the 2020 military coup, U.S. foreign assistance for the Government of Mali has been restricted pursuant to section 7008 of t he annual appropriations act. Mali is currently suspended from Economic Community of West African States and the AU. MAURITANIA Overview: Mauritania remained an excellent security and regional CT partner for the United States. Despite continued te rrorist violence in neighboring Mali, the country has not suffered a terrorist attack on its soil since 2011. Countering terrorist activity remains the top priority for the Mauritanian government, and Mauritanian military leadership underscores this messa ge when appealing to donor nations for additional equipment and training assistance. During the year, the government continued to focus its efforts to prevent what it termed extremism, and it took steps to increase its capacity to deter and respond to terrorist attacks, including by working with the Mine Advisory Group and the United States to better manage ammunition stockpiles to prevent them from falling into terrorists' hands. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorist incidents reported in Mauritania in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The Mauritanian government did not pass or amend any laws regarding terrorism during 2021 . The Department of State's Antiterrorism Assistance program, in cooperation with the Regional Security Office and host nation partner forces, provided numerous trai ning opportunities for more than 200 national gendarmerie personnel. Training topics included tactical medicine, facilities protection, active shooter response, managing terrorism investigations, and emergency preparedness. On February 8 , the U.S. ambas sador and the Mauritanian Minister of Interior and Decentralization signed a n MOU to facilitate continued cooperation on border management assistance at all of Mauritania's land, air, and sea points of entry to identify, disrupt, and deter terrorist travel . Mauritania's battalion to the G -5 Sahel Joint Force is deployed near the border with Mali to help with CT and counter smuggling operations. The Mauritanian Ministry of Justice also worked with the UNODC, the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute, and the German Embassy to host a n October 25 workshop to train judges and other judicial officials on how t o dismantle the links between organized crime and terrorism. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Mauritania is a member of MENAFATF. In addition to the Central Bank's Financial Intelligence Unit (CANIF), Mauritania has two national committees, th e National Committee to Combat Terrorist Financing and the National Committee to Combat Money Laundering, which are tasked with improving internal government coordination on these issues. CANIF also continued to roll out additional security requirements on money transfers to increase transparency on transactions. Countering Violent Extremism: Mauritania continued its efforts to counter violent extremism, including through several partnerships with the United States. On October 27 , the U.S. ambassador launched an $800,000 two -year program with World Vision and the Mauritanian Ministry of Islamic Affairs and Traditional Education (MIATE) to work with youth, women, religious community leaders, and civil society actors to promote tolerance and f ight against what the government terms \"extremism.\" During June 16 -18, UNICEF and the MIATE implemented a U.S. -funded program to train 40 Mahadra teachers in Nouakchott. The training aimed to facilitate the integration of talibes (children, principally b oys, studying the Quran) into the country's formal education system. Throughout the year, the MIATE continued to implement and expand its \"Simple Mahadras\" program. The program aims to increase the MIATE's oversight of Mahadras in the country , to fight against extremism and ensure children are less vulnerable to becoming victims of trafficking in persons. The Mauritanian government also continued to make efforts to reintegrate former terrorists and returning FTFs . Both the Mauritanian government and civil society used strategic messaging during the year to promote alternative narratives and weaken the appeal of terrorism. For example, the government nominated Mohamedou Ould Slahi, a former Guantanamo detainee, as a brand ambassador for Mauritania during its expo in Dubai. The nomination amplified Slahi's message about the importance of turning away from extremist ideology. International and Regional Cooperation: Mauritania is a member of the following international organizations t hat have CT equities: the United Nations, the African Union , the G-5 Sahel, the Islamic Military Counterterrorism Coalition, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and NATO's Science for Peace and Security Program . Mauritania continued to work wit h international partners to combat instability in the Sahel, particularly through its engagement with the G -5 Sahel. In July , the Nouakchott -based G -5 Sahel Defense College graduated 44 international students. Most of the students came from G -5 Sahel member states, and six came from Saudi Arabia. MOZAMBIQUE Overview: The Republic of Mozambique regained significant amounts of territory from ISIS - Mozambique (ISIS -M) in 2021, but ISIS -M continued to carry out attacks in the northern part of the country. The Armed Conflict and Event Data Project reported 314 terrorist attacks in 2021, a significant decrease from 2020, but the ongoing violence in Cabo Delgado Province has displaced more than 800,000 people since it began in 2017. On March 24, ISIS -M attacked the northeast town of Palma, creating thousands of IDPs as ISIS - M expanded its c ontrol over the province. In response, TotalEnergies halted its natural gas development operations in nearby Afungi peninsula and declared force majeure . However, starting in July 2021, the deployment of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Mission in Mozambique and Rwandan Defen se Force (RDF) assisted the Mozambican Defen se and Security Forces (FDS) to regain territory, including Palma and Moc\u00edmboa da Praia, a strategic port town that ISIS -M had taken in 2020. As of Novembe r 30, the Government of the Republic of Mozambique reported that troops had captured 245 suspected terrorists and killed 200 terrorists in battle. As ISIS -M fighters dispersed, they attacked several villages, including in two districts in Niassa Province . 2021 Terrorist Incidents: The following list details a small number of significant attacks: On March 24, ISIS -M launched a multipronged complex attack on the town of Palma, resulting in a days -long effort to reassert government control over the dis trict and prompting at least 50,000 IDPs to flee the area. On September 12, ISIS -M ambushed an RDF convoy in Moc\u00edmboa da Praia district, killing four RDF soldiers and injuring six others. On October 2, ISIS -M kidnapped seven women from Nacate village in M acomia district, which is located south of Moc\u00edmboa da Praia. In November and December, ISIS -M moved across the provincial line into Niassa Province for the first time and attacked several villages in Mecula and Marrupa districts. On December 15, ISIS -M reportedly decapitated a Christian pastor in Macomia district and ordered his wife to give his head to the FDS. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: In 2021 , the Government of the Republic of Mozambique began crafting new legislation to amend current terrorism laws, though it did not complete the process during the calendar year. The proposed amendments create criminal penalties for domestic terrorism -related offenses, whereas current law addresses only international terrorism. The amendments would also establish sentences for terrorism -related crimes between eight and 24 years in prison, the maximum penalty in Mozambique. There were no significant changes in 2021 to Mozambique's law enforcement CT cap acity. Border security also remained a challenge for Mozambique, with no significant changes in 2021 . Countering the Financing of Terrorism: In June 2021, ESAAMLG released its Mutual Evaluation Report (MER ) for Mozambique. Among the MER' s key finding s, ESAAMLG noted \"important technical compliance gaps\" that need to be addressed and the lack of a National Risk Assessment (NRA), factors that put Mozambique at risk of placement on FATF's \"gr ay list\" of countries publicly named as deficient on illicit finance measures. The Government of the Republic of Mozambique started to address these gaps by drafting new laws on domestic terrorism, money laundering, and terrorism finance, as well as an NRA , though all were pending completion at year's end. Countering Violent Extremism: In July , the Ministry of Justice co -hosted a launch event for a National Working Group on the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR), an initiative that brought together stakeholders from government, civil society, the private sector, and the international community to discuss ways to address the drivers of conflict and instability in Mozambique's northern provinces. The Ministry of Defense also supporte d VPSHR, signaling an increase in government support for the initiative throughout 2021. On October 28, the Integrated Development Agency for the North unveiled the Resilience Plan for Northern Mozambique (ERDIN), a long -term plan to address the root ca uses of the violence through security, socioeconomic development, governance, and human rights engagement in the northern provinces of Cabo Delgado, Niassa, and Nampula. At the end of 2021, ERDIN was still waiting for approval by the Council of Ministers. International and Regional Cooperation: In 2021, Mozambique accepted significant military assistance from its neighbors and other partners, including the SADC, Portugal, Rwanda, and the EU. Portugal began training commandos and marines in May, which became part of the EU Training Mission, which launched in November, to train and equip 11 companies in the next two years. While not a GCTF member, Mozambique participated in the Fourth Plenary M eeting of the GCTF's capacity building in the East Africa Region Working Group. NIGER Overview: Niger faces terrorist threats on most of its borders. Terrorist organizations take advantage of Niger's extensive borders and sparsely populated desert r egions to attack and recruit among populations where access to government services is weak and economic opportunity is negligible. The Government of Niger is a member of the Multinational Joint Task Force and the G -5 Sahel. Niger's efforts to fight terro rism are stressed by its small defense force, ineffective coordination among security services, budget shortfalls, and instability in Burkina Faso, Chad, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, and the Lake Chad Basin. Terrorist groups active in Niger included ISIS -GS, BH, ISIS-WA, and JNIM \u2014 the last of these an amalgamation of the Saharan branch of AQIM, al -Murabitoun, Ansar al -Dine, and the Macina Liberation Front. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: Terrorist organizations carried out at least 74 attacks in Niger during 2021. Two main fronts saw attacks from BH and ISIS -West Africa (ISIS -WA) in the Southeast, and from JNIM and the ISIS -GS in the West and Northwest. The following five incidents are examples of the most significant attacks: On January 2, terrorists at tacked two villages in the Tondikiwindi district of Tillab\u00e9ri region, killing 101 civilians. On March 16, terrorists attacked the villages of Banibangou, Chinagodrar, and Darey Dey in the Tillab\u00e9ri region, killing an estimated 64 civilians and burning gra in stores. On March 21, terrorists attacked the villages of Akifakif, Bakorat, and Intazayene in the Tillia district of the Tahoua region, killing an estimated 177 civilians. On November 2, ISIS -GS attacked the village of Banibangou, Tillab\u00e9ri region, kil ling at least 69 civilians. On May 4, 200 terrorists attacked a military outpost near Banibangou in the Tillab\u00e9ri region, killing at least 15 soldiers and wounding four others. In a second attack on the same day, terrorists killed 20 civilians in Chinag odrar, Tillab\u00e9ri region. Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Following rapidly evolving threats in the tri -border region, key officials in the Ministries of the Interior and Justice amended the national framework regarding defectors to encompass the management of defectors from extremist organizations in any of Niger's impacted zones. The updated national framework, ratified in May, provides uniform defection screening by the National Police's Central Service for the Fight Against Terrorism and Tr ansnational Organized Crime (SCLCT -CTO) and the national prosecutor to determine eligibility for rehabilitation. It also provides for development of regional rehabilitation centers, and establishes a National Disengagement, Disassociation, Rehabilitation, & Reintegration (DDRR) Steering Committee. Since 2019, the IOM has expanded support to implement the DDRR program for the Tillab\u00e9ri region, similar to the Government of Niger's Rehabilitation Center in Goudoumaria, Diffa region. Completion of the country's second defections center in Hamdallaye is anticipated in 2022. Nigerien law enforcement and security services were actively engaged in detecting, deterring, and preventing acts of terrorism. CT investigations are the responsibility of the SCL CT-CTO, an interagency body formed by members of Niger's National Police, National Guard, and Gendarmerie. Niger reinforced its capacities to investigate, adjudicate, and imprison terrorists, consistent with the rule of law and international human rights. UNODC trained members of Niger's military responding to terrorism incidents to use standard operating procedures to improve the collection of evidence for use in the judicial process. Niger is recognized by regional partners as a leader in prosecuting t errorist suspects through its specialized antiterrorism court, which is supported by the embassy's U.S. Department of Justice Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training program resident legal advisor, whose work with the tribunal has suppo rted more -efficient analyses of counterterrorism cases, resulting in a reduced number of pending terrorism cases and increased capabilities of prosecutors and judges. Niger continued to enhance its capacity to detect and deter terrorist incursions at its borders and ports of entry through the expansion of new technologies, public outreach, critical infrastructure development, and additional specialized security forces assigned along the border; however, it remains dependent on international partners to fu nd and implement border security initiatives. Niger uses border security systems through the Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire (DST), a bureau within the national police responsible for travel documents, identification credentials, and border security. Border security systems collect biometric information at air and land ports of entry and are linked to INTERPOL's I -24/7 network -sharing relevant traveler information with partner nations. DST headquarters construction was completed in 2020, and the DST is now fully operational in the new facility. IOM supported DST in the development of revised legal texts to improve governance of the DST, though the reforms have not yet been formally adopted by the Ministry of Interior or included in the fi ve-year development plan to guide ongoing management and operations of the organization. The Rural Border Patrol Operations Program that launched in 2019 and provides equipment, training, and mentorship continued to see success in conducting rural patro ls along Niger's western border with Burkina Faso. The groups are identifying terrorist safe havens, arresting suspects, and recovering evidence on these groups. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Niger is a member of the GIABA. For further information on money laundering and financial crimes, see the 2021 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR), Vol. 2, Mone y Laundering and Financial Crimes . Countering Violent Extremism: In 2021, USAID strengthened women's representation, capacity, and leadership, including support for the G -5 Sahel Women's Platform and established local peace committees to strengthen local conflict monitoring, prevention, and management. USAID also supported youth -led conflict mitigation and stabilization efforts in five communes in northern Tillab\u00e9ri. The agency supported community radio stations in d elivering positive messages to counter violent extremist organizations' ideology and activities to prevent and resolve conflict at the community level. USAID supported three operational and pilot research activities on gendered drivers of violent extremi sm, the role of traditional leaders in resilience to violent extremism, and the effectiveness of community -level programming in building social cohesion and resilience. USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives focused on critical regions where emerging th reats were beginning to grow in the southern areas of the Tillab\u00e9ri and Dosso regions. Under the Niger Stability Support Initiative, USAID partnered with local leaders in these target areas to strengthen government action in response to threats to stabili ty. International and Regional Cooperation: Niger is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and co -chairs the AFFG. Niger is a member of the G -5 Sahel and the Sahel Alliance and manages the G -5 Sahel Joint Forces' Central Sector Command in Niamey and hosts a battalion in the Eastern Sector in Madama. Niger contributes troops to the Lake Chad Basin Multinational Joint Task Force and MINUSMA. Niger is a member of the Economic Community of West African States. NIGERIA Overview : ISIS-West Africa (ISIS -WA) and Boko Haram (BH) continued attacks against government and security forces and civilians in the North East region of the country , which resulted in deaths, injuries, abductions, and the destruction of property. BH attacks did not appear to discriminate between civilians and government officials, whereas ISIS-WA generally focused attacks on government and security forces and expanded efforts to implement shadow governance structures. Following BH leader Abubakar Shekau's de ath in May, BH's attacks in Nigeria decreased and thousands of BH fighters reportedly surrendered in the largest wave of defections since 2002. The Nigerian Air Force deployed A -29 Super Tucanos purchased from the United States against BH and ISIS -WA, beginning in September. The Nigerian Army largely succeeded in preventing terrorists from overrunning forward operating bases for extended periods of time. However, BH and ISIS -WA exploited the military's absence outside the \"super camps\" and abducted a id workers, attacked humanitarian operations hubs, and controlled security along many of the major roads. The deteriorating security environment exacerbated conditions for civilians and severely constrained relief operations in northeastern Nigeria. Nigeria worked under the MNJTF with neighboring countries to counter terrorist activity in the region. ISIS-WA continued to enjoy a large degree of freedom of movement throughout Borno State and eastern Yobe State. BH and ISIS -WA terrorist actions contribu ted to the internal displacement of an estimated two million people in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe States, and the external displacement of more than 328,000 Nigerian refugees to neighboring countries, principally Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. Attacks and kid nappings in the North West and North Central regions of the country by criminal gangs colloquially known as \"bandits\" reportedly caused more civilian deaths in 2021 than BH and ISIS -WA in the Northeast. Nigeria designated these groups as terrorists under domestic law on November 25 to maximize a federal security response, including the increased use of the military. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), separatists designated by the Nigerian government as a proscribed terrorist group in 2017, reportedly conducted violent attacks in the Southeast. Nigeria is a member of the Trans -Sahara Counter terrorism Program. U.S. Mission Nigeria coordinated with the Nigerian military at the Nigerian Defense Intelligence Agency's (NDIA 's) Joint Intelligence Fusion Ce nter (JIFC), Geospatial Intelligence Directorate Analysis Center, and Nigeria Defense Intelligence College. NDIA leadership requested assistance from the embassy to help build the JIFC's capabilities. Terrorist Incidents in 2021: BH and ISIS -WA carrie d out hundreds of attacks in Nigeria using small arms, captured military equipment, improvised explosive devices (person borne, vehicle borne, and animal borne), ambushes, and kidnappings. The following list details a fraction of the incidents that occurr ed: On February 23, a BH rocket attack in Maiduguri, Borno State , reportedly killed at least 16 civilians, including nine children. During March 1 -2, ISIS -WA attacked a humanitarian hub in Dikwa, Borno State, forcing dozens of NGO staff to flee and take refuge while the attackers burned several NGO compounds. On April 5, gunmen believed to represent IPOB and its Eastern Security Network attacked a jail in Imo State, reportedly freeing nearly 2,000 inmates and killing one police officer. On April 9 , fighters believed to be BH insurgents attacked in Adamawa State, killing at least five civilians and abducting around 30 women. The fighters set fire to approximately 50 homes, as well as churches, government buildings, schools, and other property , before withdrawing. At least 5,000 people were displaced to neighboring communities. On December 23, rockets reportedly fired by ISIS -WA exploded near the airport in Maiduguri, Borno State, minutes before President Buhari was scheduled to arrive by plane. Four civilians on the ground were reportedly killed. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Nigeria uses the Terrorism Act of 2011, as amended in 2013, to criminalize and prevent terrorist acts and financing. Although there were no change s to Nigeria's counterterrorism legal framework in 2021, on October 21 UNODC and the Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies launched a user guide to the Terrorism Act for law enforcement and judicial officials. The Office of the National Security Advisor is responsible for coordinating all security and enforcement agencies, including the Department of State Security (DSS), the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC), the Ministry of Justice, and the Nigeria Police Force (NPF), which has a Counterterrorism Unit and Terrorist Investigation Branch. Border security responsibilities are shared among the NPF, the DSS, the NSCDC, Customs, Immigration, and the Nigerian military. Coordination among agencies was limited. The Nigerian government has cooperated with the United States and other international partners to prevent further acts of terrorism in Nigeria. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Nigeria is a member of the Inter governmental Action Group Against Money Launderin g in West Africa (GIABA), an ECOWAS regional body and affiliate of FATF. GIABA published a report in August assessing Nigeria's counterterrorist financing measures. GIABA concluded that Nigeria has not adequately prevented BH and ISIS - WA from moving reve nues through its financial system, noting that Nigeria largely prefers intelligence, military, and law enforcement responses to terrorism , as opposed to methods that counter terrorist financing. Nigeria is seeking FATF membership and is working toward mee ting its requirements, including by addressing GIABA's findings. Nigeria's Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) was readmitted to the Egmont Group in 2018 after the NFIU became an independent agency, a change intended to make the NFIU more effective at comb ating money - laundering and corruption. Countering Violent Extremism: Nigeria's disarmament, deradicalization, and reintegration efforts are not currently well developed or coordinated. International and Regional Cooperation: Nigeria continued high -level participation in regional security and counterterrorism conferences. The country participated in several CT trainings sponsored by the United Nations. In May, participants at the 30th session of the UN Commission on Crime P revention and Criminal Justice organized an event focused on the effective criminal justice response to terrorism in northeast ern Nigeria. Nigeria is a member of the GCTF and co -chairs its Criminal Justice and Rule of Law Working Group with Switzerland. Nigeria also is an International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law Board Member. SENEGAL Overview: Although there were no reported terrorist attacks in Senegal in 2021, the Government of Senegal increasingly considers itself a potential target given ongoing terrorist activities in West Africa and instability in neighboring countries. In light of these concerns, Senegal continued to work closely with foreign partners, including U.S. military and law enforcement officials, to strengthen its CT capabilities. The risk of terrorist activity in Senegal arises primarily from the growing terrorist threats and the prevalence of multiple active terrorist groups across the region, combined with political instability in neighboring Mali and Guinea. These factors increase the risk that extremism and accompanying instability could spill across the border into Senegal . Senegal has taken steps to combat this threat by contributing troops to MINUSMA and establishing new military and gendarmerie camps along its eastern border. Internally, there are secondary risks with the promotion of \"extremist ideologies\" by a small number of religious leaders; however, these ideologies remain outside Senegal's prevailing Islamic norms. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in Senegal in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There were no significant changes to Senegal's CT legal framework in 2021. Senegal continued to enhance the capabilities of its Inter ministerial Framework for Intervention and Coordination of CT Operations (CICO). CICO, formed in 2016, is designed to coordinate the government's response to terrorism. Senegal's second -ever special terrorism court session, held March 17 to April 8, resolved six cases involving nine defendants, including a returning fighter, a young French radical, two Malian financie rs, and three Mauritanians with alleged connections to the masterminds of the 2016 Grand -Bassam attack in Cote d'Ivoire. The trial evidence revealed no alarming uptick in radicalization or insurgent activity within Senegal's borders. At the same time, th e case results showed that much work remains. Five of the nine defendants were acquitted, two by agreement of the prosecutor, which suggests inadequate investigations and insufficient evidence. Moreover, all nine of the defendants \u2014 including those ultim ately acquitted \u2014 waited as many as five years in pretrial detention before their cases were heard. Those convicted received five -year prison terms and stiff financial penalties. Senegal's gendarmerie and national police have specialized units to detec t, deter, and prevent acts of terrorism. Challenges remain to effective interagency cooperation and information sharing among the various governmental bodies that have CT functions in the country. Senegal continued to improve its law enforcement capacity by participating in multilateral efforts, such as the GCTF's Capacity -Building in the West Africa Region Working Group , AU programs, and ECOWAS. Additionally, Senegal continued to work with the IOM to promote cooperation and coordination among border age ncies. Senegalese officials remained concerned that gaps in border protection resources and regional cooperation created security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities were exacerbated by the absence of systems to verify travel document security, to screen travelers using terrorist screening watchlists, and to capture biographic and biometric information for travelers entering the country outside major ports of entry. The Government of Senegal is near implementation of U.S. Custom and Border Protecti on's Automated Targeting System -Global with the National Police, paving the way for Senegal to capture and analyze traveler data (API/PNR) in a move toward compliance with United Nations Security Council resolution 2396. Countering the Financing of Terr orism: Senegal is a member of GIABA. Senegal's FIU, the National Financial Intelligence Processing Unit, is a member of the Egmont Group. In February, Senegal made a high -level political commitment to work with FATF and GIABA to strengthen the effective ness of its AML/CFT regime. Since the adoption of its mutual evaluation review (MER) in 2018, Senegal has made progress on some of its MER recommended actions to improve technical compliance and effectiveness, including by adopting a National Strategy for AML/CFT and amending its legal and institutional framework. However, the provisions of the law have yet to be fully implemented. Countering Violent Extremism: The Senegalese Center for Security and Defense, a governmental think tank, along with the Regional Bureau for West Africa and the Sahel and Lake Chad Security Studies Institute , published a joint study on preventing violent extremism in the artisanal gold mining regions of southeastern Senegal on December 16. Recognizing the human insecuri ty risks related to extractive mining processes, this Government of Senegal -led report identified state -level, preventive solutions to address these vulnerabilities. Senegal's National Police are in the process of adopting an International Narcotics and L aw Enforcement - funded program on community policing strategies to counter violent extremism through improved community relations, security assessments, and early reporting structures. International and Regional Cooperation: Senegal is a member of the AU, ECOWAS, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the Trans -Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership . Although not a member of the G lobal Counterterrorism Forum , Senegal participated in regional workshops and activities held by the GCTF West Africa Regi on Capacity Building Working Group. France and the EU provided financial support and training to reinforce Senegal's CT and border security capabilities. SOMALIA Overview: Al-Shabaab continued to pose a significant terrorist threat in Somalia and the wider region in 2021, despite shared efforts by the Federal Government of Somalia, the United States, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), and other partners to combat the group. Al- Shabaab continued to leverage its influence in southern and central Somalia to extort millions of dollars in revenue from residents and businesses, according to the UN Panel of Experts on Somalia. The group conducted deadly operations, inc luding IED attacks, suicide bombings, complex attacks against government and civilian facilities, targeted assassinations, ambushes along supply routes, and indirect fire. There was one complex hotel attack in 2021 in which al-Shabaab's target appeared to have been a high -profile Somali National Army (SNA) general. Throughout the reporting period, al -Shabaab also deployed several car bombs against tea shops and restaurants in Mogadishu likely targeting security forces known to congregate therein. Al- Shabaab tactics, techniques, and procedures focused on targeted attacks, and the group maintained an ability to strike U.S. interests in the region. It conducted a major propaganda campaign late in the year to increase recruitment of FTFs . The Islamic State branch in Somalia (IS -Somalia) focused its efforts on revenue generation, extortion activities, and low-level targeted attacks with grenades and an occasional IED in Puntland and Mogadishu. It faced battlefield setbacks in Puntland, where the group is concentrated, owing to pressure from al -Shabaab. The Federal Government of Somalia made modest, local ized security gains with significant international assistance. The SNA, including the U.S. -trained Danab Advanced Infantry Brigade, conducted clearing operations against al -Shabaab in the Benadir, Galgaduud, Lower Jubba, Lower Shabelle, Middle Shabelle, and Mudug regions and transitioned control of some of these areas to local authorities. Holding recovered areas remained a significant challenge, inhibit ing stabilization efforts in those areas. Political instability and logistical constraints prevented t he government from achieving more durable progress on institutional reforms, force generation, and military operations targeting terrorists. Al-Shabaab fighters contested SNA control of defensive positions and supply lines. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: Somalia experienced continu al, low -intensity fighting between government -aligned forces and terrorists in 2021. Some higher -profile terrorist incidents included the follo wing : On January 31 a car bomb detonated at the Hotel Af rik in Mogadishu, and gunmen stormed inside, killing five persons , including an American, before security forces responded and killed the attackers. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. On March 5 an attack on the Bosasso, Puntland , jail killed seven security officers and freed almost 400 prisoners, many of them members of al -Shabaab, which claimed responsibility. On April 2 a car bomb detonated at the SNA base at Bariire in Lower Shabelle while a simultaneous attack occurred nearby at the Awdheegle SNA base with a car bomb and fighters . At least 48 soldiers were reportedly killed. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. On May 10 , a suicide bomber killed six police officers and wounded six more at a police station in Mogadishu. An Am erican citizen was also killed. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. On June 28, multiple car bombs were used to assault a military base in Galmudug, triggering a fight with government troops and armed locals, and killing an estimated 30 people, including soldiers and civilians. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. On August 18 the mayor of a town in central Puntland was killed at a tea shop by a large group of militants with firearms. IS-Somalia claimed responsibility. On November 25 a suicide car bomb attacked a UN convoy in Mogadishu, killing at least eight persons and wounding 17. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The Federal Government of Somalia and local auth orities demonstrated a commitment to improve the quality of Somalia's law enforcement and judicial entities and made progress on U.S. -supported counterterrorism initiatives. In 2021 , the Somali Police Force (SPF) leveraged U.S. mentorship and increased it s capacity to investigate and prosecute terrorism cases. Somalia hosted an adviser through the U.S. Watchlisting Assistance and Support Program to help develop a national -level watchlisting system. The Federal Government of Somalia and state leadership continued to recruit and train criminal investigators throughout the country and improve Somalis' access to formal justice systems. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Somalia is a member of MENAFATF. Al-Shabaab uses Somalia -based banks and mobile money services to manage its funds. The Federal Government of Somalia expanded its use of the Financial Reporting Center (FRC), a government -led financial intelligence entity , to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The FRC is now capable of referring cases for investigation to the SPF and international law enforcement and continues to monitor reports submitted by financial institutions. U.S. funding supp orted the FRC's messaging campaign through outreach activities and the establishment of a public reporting hotline. Countering Violent Extremism: The Office of the Prime Minister is responsible for coordinating Federal Government of Somalia efforts and international support for the prevention and countering of violent extremism (P/CVE). In 2021 , the Federal Government of Somalia and the SNA increased strategic communications that aimed to deny al -Shabaab control of public media narratives. Somalia , with Bureau of Counterterrorism support, continued a messaging campaign that increased enrollments in defector rehabilitation centers and created a resurrected defector hotline. International and Regional Cooperation: The Federal Government of Somalia worked with African Union (AU) and international partners to start preparing for a new AU -led mission to succeed the African Union mission in Somalia. SOUTH AFRICA Overview: There were no terrorism -related incidents in South Africa during 2 021, possibly owing to the COVID -19 pandemic. This continued a downward trend following an unusually high number of incidents in 2018. ISIS facilitation networks and cells remained a threat, after the South African government first publicly acknowledged t hem in 2016. Regional dynamics persisted as an increasing concern as terrorist groups made gains in the Southern African Development Community region, including Mozambique. The government charged Johannesburg -based brothers Brandon -Lee and Tony -Lee Thulsie for international terrorism and continues to prosecute alleged terrorists charged in previous years. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement , and Border Security: The Protection of Constitutional Democracy Against Terrorist and Related Activities Act (P OCDATARA ) criminalizes acts of terrorism and terrorism financing, and it specifies international cooperation obligations. The Regulation of F oreign Military Assistance Act of 1998 applies to nationals who attempt to or who join terrorist organizations like ISIS. The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation's Crimes Against the State Unit and South Africa's State Security Agency are tasked with detecting, deterring, and preventing acts of terrorism within South Africa. The South African Police Service (SAPS) Special Task Force is specifically trained and proficient in CT, counterinsurgency, and hostage rescue. The National Prosecuting Auth ority (NPA) prosecutes terrorism and international crime cases Prosecutors charged a South African farmer with a terrorism -related offense after he allegedly led other rioters in storming and damaging courthouse property during an October 10 protest related to a hearing for suspects charged with murdering another farmer. In 2020, South African police arrested individuals in South Africa possessing ISIS propaganda, weapons, and flags. One of the individuals was sentenced to 15 years in prison for kidnapping in 2021, but no terrorism charges were filed. All charges against other individuals arrested with him were dropped. South African border security is challenging, because of its numerous land, sea, and airports of entry for international trav elers. Multiple South African law enforcement agencies police the country's borders, but many of them are stovepiped. Inadequate communication and equipment limit their border control ability. Counterterrorism measures at the international airports in clude screening with advanced technology X -ray machines, but land borders do not have advanced technology or infrastructure. Trafficking networks use these land borders for illicit smuggling, and South Africa does not require neighboring countries' citize ns to obtain visas for brief visits. The SAPS internal affairs office investigated corruption allegations related to illicit sale of passports and other identity documents in the Department of Home Affairs, but use of illegitimately obtained identity docu ments persisted. In 2021, South Africa's NPA continued to prosecute terrorism crimes. To decentralize terrorism case prosecution and provide provincially based prosecutors with relevant experience, the NPA's Gauteng -based Priority Crimes Litigation Unit (PCLU) returned prosecutors who had been seconded to the central unit to their previous provincial assignments and reassigned terrorism cases to attorneys in judicial districts where the crimes occurred. While the PCLU retained an oversight role, it gave provincial prosecutors substantial autonomy to direct terrorism cases. Progress in several high -profile cases slowed as newly assigned NPA provincial prosecutors familiarized themselves with the cases and developed prosecution strategies. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: South Africa is a member of FATF and of ESAAMLG. South Africa's Financial Intelligence Centre is a member of the Egmont Group. Countering Violent Extremism: There are no updates in 2021. International and Regi onal Cooperation: South Africa is a member of the AU, the GCTF, and the Southern African Development Community. SUDAN Overview: The October 25 military takeover that ousted former Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and the civilian -led transitional government ( CLTG ) halted Sudan's democratic transition and stalled efforts to adjust domestic CT authorities. However, even in the period since the takeover, under the authority of Sovereign Council Chair and Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) Commander General Abdel Fattah al -Burhan, Sudan has continued to seek to strengthen CT cooperation with the United States, including through consistent information sharing and efforts to build capacity to identify terrorists and deny them safe haven within Sudan. Despite the absence of any terrorist attacks in 2021, ISIS, al -Qa'ida, and Harakat Sawa'd Misr (HASM) continued to use Sudan as a facilitation and logistics hub. Terrorist groups in recent years have likely opted not to conduct attacks insi de Sudan to preserve the country's relatively permissive environment, though this calculus could change as security forces place more pressure on terrorists. Lone actors and low -level extremists, who lack direction from senior leadership, remain a potenti al threat who could launch attacks in Sudan. The government continues to view FTFs as the predominant threat. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorist incidents in Sudan in 2021. However, o n September 28, two General Intelligence Service (GIS) officers and three noncommissioned personnel were killed during a raid on an ISIS cell in the Jabra district of Khartoum, where GIS arrested 11 foreign terrorists of various nationalities. On October 4, one security forces officer was killed during a follow -on raid in the Jabra district on the ISIS cell. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Previous efforts by the CLTG to amend the overarching CT legal framework in Sudan have been sta lled because of the military takeover. The military -led government granted security services \u2014 namely , GIS \u2014 additional authorities to target terrorists in late 2021. Otherwise, there were no significant developments regarding CT authorities in 2021. Regarding law enforcement actions against terrorism, Sudanese security forces continue to actively target and interdict terrorist cells in Sudan. Sudanese security services, primarily led by the GIS, targeted ISIS cells in Khartoum and Omdurman for arre st operations during a series of raids from late September to early October . Separately, on October 3 , security forces arrested eight foreign terrorists in Omdurman. Sudan continues to focus on improving its border security measures to track and interdi ct terrorist suspects traveling on forged passports, which is particularly important given Sudan's extensive and porous borders. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: There were no significant changes in 2021. Countering Violent Extremism: Before the October military takeover, the CLTG was focused on broadening its relationships and engagement on CVE by seeking input from international bodies, civil society, and local experts. The CLTG and security services he ld numerous joint conferences, led by the Sudan National Commission for Counter terrorism (SNCCT), with local and international stakeholders to discuss various CVE initiatives. These efforts have largely stalled since the military takeover in October. International and Regional Cooperation: Sudan continues to support CT efforts in regional and multilateral organizations. Sudan remains a member of the following groups which have CT equities: International and Ibero -American Foundation for Administrat ion and Public Policies (FIIAPP); INTERPOL; and the Eastern Africa Police Chiefs Cooperation Organization. The UN Office of Counterterrorism ( UNOCT ) organized a large introductory workshop in October to focus on interagency coordination in counterterroris m in cooperation with the SNCCT. UNOCT maintains a small team in Khartoum to liaise with Sudanese authorities, UN entities (including UNDP, UNESCO, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , and the UN Integrated Transition Assistance Mission Sudan ), and regional organizations (AU and IGAD) to share best practices for counterterrorism strategy, border security, Countering the Financing of Terrorism , and community policing. TANZANIA Overview: In 2021, the Government of Tanzania and the United States engaged in limited counterterrorism and countering violent extremism cooperation. Counterterrorism has risen in importance for the Government of Tanzania , as Tanzania faces terrorist threats within the country and along three of its borders \u2014 Kenya ( from al-Shabaab), the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( from ISIS-DRC), and Mozambique ( from ISIS-M). ISIS-M presents a significant danger to individuals in Tanzania, especially those who live along its shared bord er with Mozambique. Tanzania -Mozambique cross -border security cooperation began to materialize in 2021 through multilateral engagement \u2014 primarily with coordination provided by the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC); however, bilateral cooperation will be important for securing Tanzanian citizens and territory. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: Tanzania experienced five notable terrorist attacks in 2021: On September 20, approximately 15 ISIS -M members crossed into Mahurunga village, Mtwara Region from Mozambique. They looted and burned shops and houses and kidnapped and raped women. At least one Tanzanian was killed. On October 1, 12 members of ISIS -M attac ked civilians and looted food supplies in Kiwengulo, Mtwara. One Tanzanian woman was killed. On October 21, ISIS -M members attacked civilians in Kilimahewa, Mtwara region. A warehouse and several houses were burned. An unknown number of people were kidnapped and later rescued by the Tanzania People's Defense Force (TPDF). Fatalities are unknown. On November 13, approximately 10 members of ISIS -M raided the villages of Sindano and Michawe, Mtwara. An unknown number of civilians were killed, and at lea st four others were hospitalized. On December 10, members of ISIS -M crossed into Kiwengulo village, Mtwara, burning at least three houses and a dispensary. Four civilians were killed; three from a single family were beheaded. The attackers clashed with T PDF security forces, leaving five attackers and one TPDF member dead. Local law enforcement officials confirmed the attacks and killings with the embassy. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The Government of Tanzania did not pass or amend any laws regarding terrorism in 2021. In June, Tanzania's Director of Public Prosecutions ordered all charges dropped against 34 Zanzibari Muslim leaders held in pretrial remand on terrorism charges from 2012 through 2014. The lead ers were part of a now -defunct Islamist organization that advocated for Zanzibar independence, the Association for Islamic Mobilization and Propagation (UAMSHO). The 34 UAMSHO members were released from jail. In 2021, Government of Tanzania officials p ublicly acknowledged terrorist activities along Tanzania's border with Mozambique, a departure from the government's previous posture of publicly downplaying the threat and labeling violent extremists as \"bandits.\" In response to continued ISIS -M activity in Mozambique, the Government of Tanzania maintained a robust security personnel presence in the southern border regions of Mtwara and Ruvuma, as well as in neighboring Lindi Region. The Government of Tanzania continued to limit access of diplomatic mis sions and humanitarian organizations in some areas along the southern border. In rare bilateral engagement related to counterterrorism in 2021, Tanzania's Inspector General of Police met his Rwandan counterpart in Kigali to discuss strengthening security cooperation on cross -border crimes, particularly terrorism. Additionally, police commanders from Tanzania, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and Uganda met in Tanzania's Kigoma Region to discuss ways to maximize collaboration, intensify security along the borders, and exchange security information. A years -long effort to finalize a U.S. -funded border security program \u2014 the first in the northern Tanga Region and later shifting to the southern Mtwara Region \u2014 stalled and then expired in 2021 after Government of Tanzania ministries failed to sign a n MOU . Charges of terrorism, terrorism financing, and money laundering, all of which result in a prohibition on the use of bail, were used to incarcerate citizens, journalists, an d political party representatives for political reasons, though this practice has slowed since the transition to Samia Suluhu Hassan's presidency following the March death of former president John Magufuli. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Throughout 2021 , the United States funded anti - money laundering and countering terrorism financing training to Ministry of Finance officials. In 2021 , the Government of Tanzania continued efforts to regulate the mov ement of foreign currency . While the primary purpose of the regulations appears to be reducing tax evasion, the measures also make it easier to trace transactions, including those associated with money laundering. Countering Violent Extremism: In 2021 , the SADC and the Government of Tanzania worked to organize and plan for a Regional Counter Terrorism Center to advance counterterrorism. Tanzania's National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) remained Tanzania 's primary liaison with international partners on CVE in 2021. Starting in 2017, NCTC pa rtnered with the UNDP on a CVE project that included the development of a national CVE strategy and action plan. Since 2018, NCTC and the UNDP have assured donor countries that the national strategy and action plan would be completed imminently. In 2021 , the United States supported a UNDP initiative on community policing, aimed at building stronger ties between security providers and community members. Separately, the United States continued its support for CVE initiatives through civil society actors i n vulnerable areas to raise public awareness and increase resiliency to violent extremist threats and to understand cross -border dynamics that support terrorist actors. International and Regional Cooperation: Throughout 2021 , the Government of Tanzania engaged primarily in multilateral efforts through SADC to address regional security and counterterrorism issues. Tanzania sent a contingent of troops to the SADC's Standby Force Mission in Mozambique, which also included forces from Angola, Botsw ana, Lesotho, and South Africa. The SADC Mission joined Mozambiquan and Rwandan military efforts to combat the uprising of ISIS -M violent extremism in Cabo Delgado Province, Mozambique. Additionally, the Government of Tanzania continued to pursue training from bilateral and multilateral donors to enhance CT -related security units. UGANDA Overview: Uganda is considered to have one of the most effective security forces in the region with respect to CT capabilities . Nonethel ess, in 2021 Uganda experienced the first terrorist incidents on home soil since the 2010 bombings claimed by al -Shabaab. Four bombings in October and November were attributed to and claimed by ISIS -DRC (also known in Uganda as the Allied Democratic Force s, or ADF); authorities also attributed the June attempted assassination of the Minister of Works and Transport and former Ugandan Chief of Defen se Forces Gen. Katumba Wamala to the same group. The Uganda Peoples' Defence Forces (UPDF) began a joint operation with the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) in November to combat ISIS -DRC in the eastern Democratic Republic of th e Congo . Uganda also continued in its role as the top troop -contributing country to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), the international effort to combat al -Shabaab in Somalia. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: The following terrorist incidents too k place in Uganda during 2021: On June 1, unknown assailants attempted to assassinate Gen. Wamala, also the highest - ranking member of the Baganda ethnic group \u2014 the largest tribe in Uganda \u2014 serving in government . Assailants instead kill ed Wamala's daughter and driver in the attack on his vehicle. Security services arrested approximately 12 alleged conspirators (though the exact number remains unclear) and killed four, all with purported links to ISIS -DRC. In July and August, near Masak a (located about 93 miles southwest of Kampala bordering Lake Victoria), machete -wielding men killed at least 29 people and injured 14 others in their homes . Officials blamed the act on ethnic tensions, ISIS -DRC, and opposition lawmakers, and arrested at least 78 people \u2014 including two opposition lawmakers \u2014 but ha d not conclusively solved the case by the end of 2021 ; the motive for the killings is unclear. On August 27, security forces stopped an attempted suicide bombing at the funeral procession of f ormer Deputy Inspector General of Police Paul Lokech. Ugandan media and authorities attributed the attempt to ISIS -DRC. On October 23, three individuals hid a bomb at a restaurant in the suburbs of Kampala, a venue known to attract members of the security services as patrons. When the bomb detonated, it killed one person and injured several others. Police later attributed the attack to ISIS -DRC. On November 16, IEDs were detonated in two locations in downtown Kampala near the central police station and the Ugandan parliament building, killing those who were transporting them. Two Uganda Police Force (UPF) personnel and two passers -by also died as a result of the explosions; 27 police and nine other individuals sustained injuries requiring hospitalizatio n. The UPF attributed the bombings to the ADF and an ISIS - linked social media channel seemed to confirm this assessment by claiming responsibility for the attacks. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Despite its strong military capabilities relative to other countries in the region, Uganda remains vulnerable to terrorism. Th e vulnerability is at least in part due to porous borders, corruption, a lack of trust and information sharing among disparate security services, diversion of security force capabilities to focus on opposition politicians, an overly militarized approach to combating violent extremism within Uganda, and the security forces' poor relations with local communities and civil society. Ugandan law enforcement has been accused of torturing Muslims it accuse s of affiliation with the ADF. Lawyers defending accused terrorists (even those likely to be innocent) say they fear government harassment as well as reputational risk and possible loss of business for representing such clients. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Uganda is a member of the ESAAMLG, and Uganda's financial intelligence unit is known as the Financial Intelligence Authority (FIA); it is a member of the Egmont Group. Uganda's few large banks largely comply with international standards for anti -money laundering and countering financing of terro rism (AML/CFT), but most smaller banks do not have the capacity or technology to fully comply with international and national standards. In June , the Bank of Uganda began regulating mobile money transactions in line with successful passage of the 2020 National Payment Systems Act, which added mobile money financial transactions to the financial system's regulatory framework. The FIA historically was a capable and willing partner, but it lacks the high -level political wil l to effectively regulate the financial sector. Additionally, the FIA's reputation remains severely damaged after it froze the accounts of respected NGOs working in the democracy and governance space that receive funding from the United States and other d onors for political reasons preceding the January presidential elections. FATF placed Uganda on its gr ay list in 2020 based on shortcomings in Uganda's efforts to tackle AML/CFT. Uganda made a high -level political commitment to work with FATF and ESAAMLG to strengthen its AML/CFT regime and planned to implement FATF's recommendations by midyear 2022 . Countering Violent Extremism: As of December, Uganda had still not approved its draft national strategy to counter violent extremism. Additionally, any progress previously made in improving community policing has likely been lost because of multiple violent crackdowns by security serv ices in the lead up to and aftermath of the January elections and confirmed and alleged terror attacks throughout the year. Violence and reported prolonged and unexplained detention at the hands of law enforcement are some of the major \"push factors\" of v iolent extremism in Uganda, reinforcing a key narrative employed by violent extremist recruiters to radicalize youths to violence. International and Regional CT Cooperation: In December , the UPDF deployed 2,500 troops in a joint military operation with FARDC designated \"Shujaa\" to combat ISIS -DRC in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo . Uganda continued to be the largest troop - contributing country to AMISOM in 2021, with close to 6,000 personnel, and was responsible for the region in Somalia th at suffers the largest number of al -Shabaab attacks, especially from IEDs. EAST ASIA AND THE PACIFIC Overview During 2021, governments in East Asia and the Pacific faced diminished threats from U.S.- designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations, REMVE, and terrorists inspired by ISIS. CT pressure from regional security forces made significant impacts on the leadersh ip structure of several terrorist organization s in the Philippines and Indonesia. Most incidents involved attacks against soft targets and public spaces, such as a March suicide bombing at a church in Indonesia and a bus attack in the Philippines that kil led four persons in June. CT pressure and the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic may have reduced opportunities for radicalization to violence through more traditional, person -to-person networks and increased the phenomenon of radicalization online as many people spent more time at home and online. The pandemic and corresponding increases in time spent online also has exacerbated the problem of misinformation and disinformation, particularly online, and allowed terrorists greater opportunities to gain new adherent s on the internet and inspire violence. REMVE continues to be a concern for Australia and New Zealand. Governments in East Asia and the Pacific voiced concerned about the possibility of Afghanistan attracting a new wave of foreign terrorist fighters. Authorities in East Asia and the Pacific continued to investigate and prosecute terrorism cases, increase regional cooperation and information sharing, and address critical border and aviation security gaps. Australia, China, Indonesia, Japan, and New Zea land are members of the Global Counterterrorism Forum. Japan also is a member of the G -7 Counterterrorism and Counter - Crime Rome -Lyon Group. Regional multilateral organizations, such as ASEAN and the ASEAN Regional Forum, also shared best practices on co unterterrorism and countering violent extremism. Burma and the People's Republic of China used counterterrorism as a pretext to crack down on opposition movements and to repress members of religious and ethnic minorities, respectively. AUSTRALIA Overview: The Counter terrorism Coordination Centre within the Department of Home Affairs is responsible for domestic policy development; whole -of-government coordination, including the use of counterterrorism laws relating to citizenship cess ation; listing of terrorist organizations; and treatment of high -risk terrorism offenders. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade leads Australia's international CT engagement. In December , the Australian government listed Hizballah in its entirety as a terrorist organization for the purposes of the Criminal Code Act 1995. Previously, Australia 's listing was restricted to Hizballah 's External Security Organization. At the end of 2021, Australia's National Terrorism Threat Advisory System remained a t \"Probable,\" the third -highest level on a five -level scale. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in Australia in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: In August, Parliament passed the Counterterrorism Legislation Amendment (Sunsetting Review and Other Measures) Bill 2021, which extended the Federal Court's powers to impose control and preventive detention orders to manage terrorist threats by continuing the detention of persons of conce rn. In November, Parliament passed the Counterterrorism Legislation Amendment (High -Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2020, which lengthens the extended supervision order (ESO) arrangement for high -risk terrorist offenders where a state or territory Supreme Court determines they continue to pose a risk to the community at the end of their custodial sentence. The ESO will enable a person to be released into the community, subject to prohibitions and other conditions on their activities, associations, and move ments. Also in November, the government introduced into Parliament the National Security Legislation Amendment (Comprehensive Review and Other Measures No. 1) Bill 2021 to address operational challenges facing Australia's intelligence agencies. Key eleme nts of the bill include authorization for agencies to produce intelligence on Australians who are, or are likely to be, involved with listed terrorist organizations and strengthened arrangements for Australian intelligence agencies to cooperate with one an other and with other organizations. Significant law enforcement actions and judicial determinations in 2021 included the following: In March, Ahmed Luqman Talib, who was publicly listed by the U.S. government as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in 2020, was arrested on charges of arranging travel to Syria for a terrorist in 2013. In September, three men were arrested and charged by the Victorian Joint Counter terrorism Team for planning a 2018 terrorist attack in Melbourne were sentenced to 10 years ' imprisonment with a nonpatrol period of seven years and six months. In October , the Supreme Court of N ew South Wales sentenced three individuals for separate terrorism offenses: Seven years and four months ' imprisonment for acts in preparation of a terrorist act in Australia and preparing for foreign incursions. Three years and 10 months ' imprisonment for being a member of a terrorist organization and advocating terrorism \u2014 the first time a person in Austra lia has been sentenced for the offence of advocating terrorism. Five years and four months ' imprisonment for acts in preparation of a terrorist act and exporting prohibited material. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: There have been n o changes since 2020. Countering Violent Extremism: The Department of Home Affairs coordinates a comprehensive national approach to preventing and countering violent extremism \u2014 whether politically, religiously, or racially motivated \u2014 as a shared effort among federal, state , and territory government agencies. The program's stated objective is to combat the threat posed by homegrown terrorism and to discourage Australians from traveling overseas to participate in conflicts. The government 's approach comprises four complement ary streams of activity , including building strength in diversity and social participation; targeted work with vulnerable communities and institutions; addressing terrorist propaganda online; and diversion and deradicalization. In March, Australia designa ted the right -wing organization Sonnenkrieg Division as a terrorist group. In November , the Minister of Home Affairs declared right -wing extremist organization The Base a terrorist group. These designations make it a criminal offense to be a member of ei ther group. In October , the Minister of Home Affairs chaired a national Ministerial Meeting on Counter terrorism , which brought together state and territor ial ministers responsible for these matters to discuss the current and future threat environment and identify opportunities for enhanced cooperation to respond to them. International and Regional Cooperation: Australia continued to play an active role in t he Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and was a leading contributor to the Defeat -ISIS Coalition's military support, humanitarian aid, strategic communications, and efforts to disrupt foreign terrorist fighters. Australia is a financial supporter and board m ember of the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund and a member of the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. Established in 2012, the Australia -New Zealand Counter -Terrorism Committee (ANZCTC) functions as a high -level body consisting of representatives from the two countries' federal, state, and territor ial governments. Since 2017, Australia has co -chaired the Global Counterterrorism Forum's (GCTF 's) Countering Violent Extremism Working Group with its partner , Indonesia. The CVE W orking Group has concentrated on a range of GCTF initiatives to develop and implement best -practice guidance on fighting extremism in line with the UN Global Counter terrorism Strategy. Most recently, the Working Group developed a Gender and P/CVE Policy T oolkit for presentation to other GCTF Member States at the Forum's 20th Coordinating Committee and 12 th Ministerial meeting. In 2021, Australia's ambassador for counterterrorism led whole -of-government consultations with regional partners in Southeast Asia, which strengthened operational relationships and provided technical assistance. Australia also participated (with the United States, India, and Japan) in the second Quad counterterrorism tabletop exercise in November, hosted by India. Australia continues to engage with Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) partners and in ASEAN -related fora on counterterrorism and law enforcement cooperation, including technical and regulatory assistance to develop and implement counterterrorism legislation. For example, Australia and the United States in February co-hosted with the Philippines the second virtual workshop in a three -workshop series for ASEAN Regional F orum members on watchlisting, aviation security, and information sharing. The Australian Federal Police works with policing agencies in Southeast Asia. PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (HONG KONG AND MACAU) CHINA Overview: The counterterrorism efforts of the People's Republic of China continued to target almost exclusively ethnic Uyghur and other Turkic Muslim alleged extremists, whom Beijing labels as the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a group Beijing considers the primary source of terrorism in Xinjiang. However, the United States has not seen clear and convincing evidence of ETIM's existence. In July and August, as the United States was withdrawing forces from Afghanistan, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called on the Taliban to \"re -impose the ban on Xinjiang's Uyghur militant group, ETIM,\" and to \"resolutely and effectively combat\" the organization. Further, People's Republic of China officials stated that Beijing would strengthen ties with the Taliban to ensu re \"ETIM do[es] not function from Afghanistan's soil targeting Xinjiang.\" The Government of the People's Republic of China's measures, which it describes as counterterrorism, have included holding more than one million people in detainment camps. NGO d ata have identified more than 12,000 of these detainees who were sentenced to prison terms, in most cases for five to 20 or more years. When questioned, the People's Republic of China claimed that the camps are vocational education and training centers. The People's Republic of China denies that its Xinjiang policies involve human rights abuses, claiming its system of \"reeducation\" camps exist to \"combat separatism and Islamist militancy in the region\" and are a crucial part of the \"war on terror.\" China continued to expand law enforcement tools and enhance its military and counterterrorism capacities to justify and improve its ability to carry out this repressive campaign, respond to threats because of China's increasing global economic footprint, and ga rner international support for its counterterrorism -related policies. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: People's Republic of Chinese officials claimed that no violent terrorist incidents occurred in the country; however, Chinese authorities continued to use coun terterrorism as a pretext to prosecute ethnic Uyghurs, who are predominantly Muslim, and members of other ethnic and religious minorities, on terrorism charges. In April, Shirzat Bawudun , former head of Xinjiang's Department of Justice, and Sattar Sawut, former head of Xinjiang's Department of Educ ation, were sentenced to death on terrorism and extremism charges; five others were given lesser sentences. International terrorist -related incidents associated with Chinese citizens continued in 2021, including a targeted gun assault by a Sindhi separatist group in Karachi, Pakistan, that wounded a People's Republic of China national; a Tehrik -e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) attack on China's ambassador to Pakistan, during which four others died; a Balochistan Liberation Front (BLA) attack on two People' s Republic of China nationals in Karachi; a BLA suicide bombing attempt against Chinese interests in Gwadar, Pakistan; and the deaths of nine Chinese workers by suicide bomb in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which China attributed to ETIM with TTP's assistance. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The People's Republic of China continued to advance and defend its counterterrorism policies, including reeducation camps in Xinjiang. On June 1, the People's Bank of China issued a rev ised draft anti -money laundering law for public comment, with the stated goal of preventing and curbing money laundering and terrorist financing as well as safeguarding national security. As of this report's publication, the legislation has not been passe d. Under the pretext of securing the border against ETIM members, the People's Republic of China placed politically motivated INTERPOL red notices against Uyghurs. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: China is a member of the Financial Action Task Force, the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering, and the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing. China's Financial Intelligence Unit is not a member of the Egmont Group and lacks capacity or political will to effectively sha re financial intelligence. Based on current law enforcement investigations, the People's Republic of China does not adequately control terrorist financing. Chinese law enforcement claimed to have limited ability to freeze funds and investigate banking tr ansactions, and no corporate transparency regulations exist. China piloted a central bank -backed digital currency known as the eCNY, or eCNY Digital Currency Electronic Payment, to deter use of other virtual currencies, among other objectives. The People 's Republic of China also increased regulatory scrutiny of the financial sector by making improvements to the anti -money laundering framework. However, serious shortcomings persisted in effective implementation and ensuring transparency, particularly in t he context of international cooperation. Countering Violent Extremism: The People's Republic of China continued to implement broad repressive campaigns in Xinjiang under the guise of countering what the Chinese government calls \"extremism.\" China's re pressive measures include mass \"reeducation\" and \"vocational training\" of predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups. Despite the United States' 2021 determination that People's Republic of China authorities in Xinjiang have committed genocide and crimes against humanity and strong condemnations from many other countries, China continued to defend its policies in Xinjiang and obstructed access to the region by international observers. In October, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Spokesperson Xu Guixiang stated: \"The so -called Xinjiang -related issues are not ethnic, religious, or human rights issues at all, but antiviolence, antiterrorism, anti - infiltration, antiseparation, and anti -interference issues.\" Under t he pretext of counterterrorism efforts, the People's Republic of China used existing domestic laws to actively screen, monitor, and censor its citizens on the internet. The People's Armed Police is increasingly focused on internal security and joint oper ations with the People's Liberation Army and is developing capabilities for rapid response, mobility, and counterterrorism operations, which included \"counterterrorism in Xinjiang and Tibet.\" In December, the People's Liberation Army conducted emergency d rills and joint law enforcement drills in a nationwide campaign. A 2021 Department of Defense report noted that the People's Republic of China continued to develop military and law enforcement capabilities and further coordination between Chinese military and counterterrorism apparatuses, stating: \"Xi Jinping and [People's Armed Police] with integrating themselves into the [People's Liberation Army's] joint operation system.\" International and Regional Cooperation: The People's Republic of China engaged in multilateral, regional, and bilateral fora, seeking to present itself as a global leader on counterterrorism. China continued to promote the UN as the primary international forum for counterterrorism , where it actively advances a repressive approach to counterterrorism. On July 28, Wang Yi met with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, then the political chief of Afghanistan's Taliban, urging the Taliban to \"make a clean break with all terrorist organizations, including ETIM.\" In response, the Taliban leader said it \"will never allow any force to use Afghan territory to engage in acts detrimenta l to China.\" In August the People's Republic of China conducted antiterrorism drills with Tajikistan, citing concerns about terrorist elements from Afghanistan spilling over the border. In September, troops from China and Pakistan conducted a joint exe rcise as part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization's (SCO's) Regional Antiterrorism Structure. In September, President Xi presented a five -point proposal underscoring SCO's important efforts over the past 20 years. On December 22, the China Institute of International Studies, which is affiliated with the MFA, organized the second International Seminar on Counterterrorism, focused on new threats and joint response measures to counter terrorism, particularly in Afghanistan , in which 17 countries partici pated. The People's Republic of China is a member of the following organizations: The ASEAN Regional Forum The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation The East Asia Summit The Global Counter Terrorism Forum The SCO Regional Anti -Terrorism Structure Hong Ko ng Overview: Historically, Hong Kong has been neither a hub nor a target for international terrorist groups or extremists and has long maintained highly efficient security forces. Strict travel restrictions put in place by the Government of Hong Kong, because of the COVID -19 pandemic, have further reduced the likelihood of foreign terrorist threats to the city. Consequently, Hong Kong law enforcement has not been a close partner on counterterrorism matters, including intelligence sharing. However , Hong Kong remains an important financial center and is geographically close to countries with known domestic and foreign terrorism issues \u2014 including Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 providing a potential nexus for terrorist financing flows and a possible location for terrorist activities when international travel returns to normal. Hong Kong continued security and law enforcement cooperation with the United States through the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department's joint implementation of the Container Security Initiative. Hong Kong cooperated internationally on counterterrorism efforts through INTERPOL and other security -focused organizations. Despite these efforts, the Government of Hong Kong and its law enforcement apparatus could be a stronger par tner on counterterrorism and other security challenges, such as providing more information related to terrorism financing and associated activities. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: The Hong Kong Police reported an incident on July 1, which it described as a lo ne-wolf-style domestic terrorist attack, involving a man using a knife to wound a male police officer and then killing himself. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Counterterrorism remained an operational priority for the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF). The Police Counterterrorism Response Unit provides a strong deterrent presence, assisting police districts with counterterrorism strategy implementation and complementing the tactical and professional support of existing police specia list units, such as the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Bureau, the Special Duties Unit, the Airport Security Unit, and the VIP Protection Unit. In 2018 the Government of Hong Kong set up the Interdepartmental Counter -Terrorism Unit (ICTU) to strengthen ov erall counterterrorism efforts by monitoring global trends, reviewing and improving counterterrorism strategies in Hong Kong, developing specialized counterterrorism training, and optimizing emergency response plans. The ICTU held its most recent countert errorism exercise in November. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Hong Kong is a member of the Financial Action Task Force and the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG). Hong Kong's Joint Financial Intelligence Unit is a member of the Egmo nt Group. In May the Government of Hong Kong concluded a three -month consultation on legislative proposals to enhance Hong Kong's Anti -Money Laundering and Counter -Financing of Terrorism (AML/CTF) regime through the introduction of a licensing requirement for virtua l asset services providers and a registration system for dealers in precious metals and stones. As of December, the government had not yet introduced a bill into the Legislative Council. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supervises financial ins titutions' risk management systems and takes disciplinary actions for those failing to comply with AML/CFT measures. In 2021, disciplinary actions were taken against three Chinese banks and a Hong Kong -based online payment provider. To improve the effici ency and effectiveness of AML/CFT measures, HKMA in November launched AML Regtech Lab, or AMLab, to allow experimentation with technologies and data analytics for preventing and detecting financial crimes. In September the Securities and Futures Commis sion published its revised AML/CFT guidelines, which include additional guidance to facilitate the adoption of a risk -based approach to AML/CFT measures by securities industry participants. The revised guidelines require financial institutions to apply ad ditional due diligence and risk mitigation measures for cross - border correspondent relationships in the securities sector, such as determining through publicly available information whether the respondent institution has been subject to targeted financial sanctions or regulatory actions and obtaining senior management's approval before establishing cross -border correspondent relationships. The guidelines also prohibit financial institutions from establishing or continuing a cross -border correspondent relat ionship with a shell financial institution. Countering Violent Extremism: There were no changes to Hong Kong's CVE programming in 2021. International and Regional Cooperation: In 2020, the President's executive order on Hong Kong normalization dire cted agencies to take action to end the provision of training to members of the Hong Kong Police Force or other Hong Kong security services at the Department of State's International Law Enforcement Academies. A Greater Bay Area (GBA) Anti -Money Launder ing Summit was organized in October to enhance exchange and cooperation on AML among mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. The GBA refers to mainland China's development plan to promote economic and social integration between and among Hong Kong, Macau, a nd nine cities in Guangdong province. Hong Kong is also an APEC economy. During July 27 -31, the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau conducted the first Guangdong -Hong Kong -Macau tripartite counter -cyber -and-physical -terrorism exercise with the Cyber Criminal Investigation Department of the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department and the Macau Judiciary Police. The exercise simulated a terrorist group planning to launch a terrorist attack in Hong Kong. Macau Overview: Historically, Macau has not been a proactive partner on counterterrorism matters, including intelligence sharing. Macau is neither a hub nor a target for international terrorist groups or extremists and maintains highly efficient security services. The stringent travel restrictions put in place by the Macau government because of the COVID -19 pandemic further reduced the likelihood of foreign terrorist threats to the city. Macau is one of the most successful and popular destinations for gambling globally and is geographically close to countries with known domestic and foreign terrorism issues, such as Indonesia and the Philippines. When international travel returns to normal levels, the city will potentially be a nexus for facilitating terrorism financing or location for terrorist activities. The Police Intervention Tactical Unit (UTIP) branch of the Macau Public Security Police Force is responsible for CT issues. UTIP's responsibilities include protecting important installations and dignitaries and IED deactivation. Macau cooperated internationally on counterterrorism efforts through INTERPOL and other security -focused organizations. Despite these efforts, Macau and its law enforcement apparatus could be a stronger partner on counterterrorism and other security challenges, including providing more information related to terrorism financing and associated activities. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: No terrorist incidents were reported in Macau in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There are no updates for 2021. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Macau is a member of the APG. Macau's Financial Intelligence Unit, the Financial Intelligence Office (GIF), is a member of the Egmont Group. The GIF's functions include freezing assets, introducing the AML/CFT assessment standards of international organizations, and sharing international organizations' recommendations for law enforcement authorities to step up AML/CFT efforts. The GIF's director was appointed by FATF in 2020 as co-chair of the Asia/Pacific Joint Group (APJG), a financial action task force subgroup responsible for establishing sanction and monitoring lists. The GIF director chaired or participated in more than 20 virtual APJG meetings in 2021. The GIF provided AML/CFT training sessions to more than 900 practitioners from the financial and gaming sectors in 2021. Macau's interdepartmental AML/CFT working group, which was established in 2002 and currently consists of 15 government agencies, held one AML/CFT plena ry meeting in May to prioritize project items listed in the Five-Year Strategic Plan for Anti -Money Laundering (2021 - 2025). The working group is responsible for tracking the development of AML/CFT international standards and best practices, and formulatin g overall policies against money laundering, terrorism financing, and the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Countering Violent Extremism: There were no changes in 2021. International and Regional Cooperation: In April the GIF signed an MOU with the New Zealand Financial Intelligence Unit on the exchange of AML/CFT intelligence. In July, Macau's Judiciary Police conducted the first Guangdong -Hong Kong -Macau tripartite counter -cyber -and-physical -terrorism drill with the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department and the HKPF to prepare for a large -scale bomb attack and a hostage -taking crisis. The 2020 -21 tripartite online meeting among Macau authorities and thos e on the mainland and in Hong Kong to foster cooperation on AML/CFT took place in October, in a virtual format, with a focus on facilitating a cross -border intelligence -sharing mechanism. INDONESIA Overview: Indonesia continued to detect, disrupt, degrade, and deny safe haven for terrorist groups operating within its borders. ISIS-affiliated Mujahidin Indonesia Timur (MIT), Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), and ISIS -inspired lone actors targeted police and other symbols of state author ity. While not a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, the Indonesian government and Muslim civil society leaders continually denounced ISIS and actively promoted the importance of CVE efforts to complement law enforcement counterterrorism efforts. Indonesia pursued members of al-Qa'ida -inspired Jemaah Islamiyah connected to charity fundraising, legitimate businesses, or active in mainstream religious organizations. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: ISIS-inspired groups and lone actors continued to target civilians and law enforcement: On March 28, two JAD members executed a suicide bombing in front of the Sacred Heart of Jesus Cathedral Church in Makassar, South Sulawesi, injuring 20 people. On March 31, Indonesian National Police (INP) killed an ISIS -inspired suspect after she fired an airsoft gun at police at the INP headquarters in Jakarta. In May, MIT members killed four villagers in Poso district, Central Sulawesi. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: On April 24 , the coordinating minister for political, legal, and security affairs announced the designation of Papuan armed groups as terrorist organizations, but Indonesia has not to date added those groups to its domestic List of Terrorism Suspects and Terrorist Org anizations. Human rights organizations raised concerns of suspected extrajudicial killings by Indonesian security forces in the provinces of Papua and West Papua as part of CT operations. Human rights groups also continued to advocate for reform of the 2 018 Anti terrorism Law, citing concerns that provisions of the law that allow detention without trial were not in line with international norms. The Government of Indonesia in January adjudicated victims' requests for compensation for damages incurred attr ibutable to past terrorist attacks in Indonesia , in accordance with Regulation No. 35/2020 on Providing Compensation, Restitution, and Assistance to Witnesses and Victims , as an implementing regulation under the 2018 Law on Terrorism. INP counterterrorism force Densus 88 reported the arrests of 370 terror suspects during 2021, 13 of whom died while resisting arrest or in custody. Densus 88 on September 18 killed MIT lead er Ali Kalora while executing the joint police -military task force Operation Madago Raya in Parigi Moutong district, Central Sulawesi. The government extended Operation Madago Raya (formerly Operation Tinombala) through December 31. Indonesia in April se ntenced six suspects to death for masterminding the 2018 riot inside the INP mobile brigade command HQ detention facility in Jakarta that killed five personnel. The National Counter terrorism Agency (BNPT) said 13 Indonesian foreign terrorist fighters were repatriated from the Philippines and Malaysia in 2021. Border security improved, but challenges remain. Indonesia's Customs and Excise Directorate General has the capability to screen most international passenger traffic against INTERPOL databases. Indonesia also actively contributed stolen and lost travel document (SLTD) records to the INTERPOL global database through automation. Police and other agencies maintain watchlists of suspected terrorists, but lines of communication and coordination among stakeholder agencies were not always clear. The U.S. gover nment is working in coordination with BNPT and other Indonesian border security and law enforcement agencies to develop and consolidate these efforts through the Watchlisting Assistance and Support Program (WASP). Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Indonesia is a member of the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering. Indonesia's F inancial Intelligence Unit, the Indonesian Financial Transaction Reports and Analysis Center, is a member of the Egmont Group. Indonesia acquired observer status in FATF i n 2018 and is on track toward full membership sometime in 2022. The nation is also a member of the Defeat -ISIS Coalition's Counter -ISIS Finance Group. In 2021, Indonesia arrested, prosecuted, and convicted individuals for financing terrorism and added 17 entities to its List of Terrorism Suspects and Terrorist Organizations. Countering Violent Extremism: Indonesia issued a presidential executive order on January 6, formalizing its National Action Plan for CVE. BNPT also managed \"deradicalization\" programs for terrorist convicts. Indonesians deported from third countries for attempted travel to Iraq and Syria were enrolled in a one -month deradicalization program at a rehabilitation shelter operated by the Ministry of Social Affairs in Bambu Apus, East Jakarta. BNPT used former terrorists for CVE outreach campaigns and helped establish boarding schools to educate children of former terrorists. International and Regional Cooperation: Indonesia continued to use the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation as a regional training center. Indonesia co -chairs the Global Counterterrorism Forum CVE Workin g Group with Australia , which has been extended until late 2024. The Australian -Indonesia Partnership for Justice Phase 2 (AIPJ2) on law and justice reform from 2017 to 2022 addressed the prevention of violent extremism. BNPT in November recognized the H edayah Center for modeling the Indonesian experience in the treatment of children and families affected by violent extremism as a best practice in the Blueprint of a Rehabilitation and Reintegration Center: Guiding Principles for Rehabilitating and Reinte grating Returning Foreign Terrorist Fighters and Their Family Members. With support from the Government of Japan, Hedayah and BNPT in September delivered a capacity building program on Supporting Families in Countering Violent Extremism in Jakarta . Indonesia continued to support CT efforts in several regional and multilateral organizations , including the UN, ASEAN , the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) Inter sessional Meetings on Counterterrorism , the ARF Work plan on Counterterrorism and Transnational Crime , the ASEAN Defense Ministerial Meetings (ADMM) , the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights , and the APEC Counterterrorism Working Group . The United States and Indonesia cohosted a virtual workshop with the Republic of Korea for ASEAN members o n terrorism watchlisting in November. MALAYSIA Overview: Malaysia sustained counterterrorism efforts to monitor, arrest, deport, and prosecute suspected supporters of terrorist groups. Malaysian law enforcement cooperated with the United States and regional partners to increase border security at ports of entry to detect and disrupt terrorist transit and deny safe haven for terrorist networks. Malaysia is a member of the GCTF and promotes a whole -of-government approach to counter recruitment and disinformation from violent extremist groups. 2021 Terrorist Inci dents: There were no terrorist attacks in Malaysia in 2021, but the country remained a transit point and , to a lesser extent, a destination country for members of terrorist groups , including ISIS, Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), and al -Qa'ida. On May 8, Malaysia n authorities reported the arrest and deportation of eight suspected Abu Sayyaf members from the Philippines who were reportedly planning kidnap -for-ransom activities in Sabah, a northern province in East Malaysia. Law enforcement also reported the subsequent deportation of seven suspected ASG members and the killing of two suspected ASG subleaders on May 18 , who allegedly aimed to carry out kidnapping activities to fund ASG operations in the southern Philippines. The Eastern Sabah Security Command maintained its \"heightened alert\" status for the East Sabah area and increased maritime patrols to safeguard against kidnappings and cross - border threats. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The Malaysian government did not make any change s to its security related laws, including the Security Offense Special Measures Act, the Prevention Against Terrorism Act, or the Sedition Act. Human rights organizations again advocated for a repeal of the laws, citing concerns that provisions of the law that allow detention without trial were not in line with international norms. The Royal Malaysia Police (RMP) Special Branch Counterterrorism Unit has the lead counterterrorism law enforcement role. There were no media reports of prosecution or d etention of terrorism -related suspects. Authorities stated that border closures and restricted in -country movements during the COVID -19 pandemic limited transit of terrorist networks, leading to a declining trend of arrests. Officials stated that terrori st transit through sea routes and porous borders remained a concern in Malaysia. Malaysian authorities reported one Malaysian national repatriated from Syria in 2021. The government has reportedly repatriated 17 terrorist fighters to Malaysia from Sy ria and Iraq to date. The returnees include 13 adults and four children, with eight of theadults serving criminal sentences, according to media reports. Those released were admitted to a rehabilitation program administered by the government. The Malays ian government has allowed its citizens to return, provided they comply with checks, enforcement, and a government -run rehabilitation program. Malaysia has reportedly worked with other countries to facilitate its repatriations and estimates that 56fighte rs and their families remain in the Middle East. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Malaysia is a member of Financial Action Task Force and the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering. Malaysia's Financial Intelligence and Enforcement Division is a member of the Egmont Group. In December, Malaysia's central bank (Bank Negara Malaysia, or BNM) announced preliminary findings from the National Risk Assessment 2020 (NRA 2020), prepared by the National Coordination Committee to Counter Mone y Laundering. The NRA 2020 identified fraud, illicit drugs trafficking, corruption , bribery, organized crime, and smuggling as crimes posing the highest risk of money laundering activity in Malaysia. The NRA 2020 also identified environmental crimes (e.g ., wildlife trafficking, illegal mining) and cyber -enabled extortion as posing an \"elevated risk\" for money -laundering activities. BNM reported in December that the Malaysian Financial Intelligence Network, established in 2019 to facilitate information sh aring between financial institutions and law enforcement agencies, has processed 44 cases related to terrorism financing, proliferation financing, corruption, and securities offenses to date. Countering Violent Extremism: In 2021 , the Southeast Asia Reg ional Cent er for Counterterrorism (SEARCCT) actively promoted a whole -of-society approach in preventing and countering violent extremism. These efforts included capacity building workshops with media professionals and civil society organizations to enhanc e their potential to analyze and report on terrorism trends and contribute to CVE efforts. SEARCCT also initiated its own podcast on counterterrorism narratives to encourage youth engagement. Episodes have been broadcast in both Malay and English. On regional cooperation, SEARCCT hosted training programs on border protection against terrorism in partnership with the Australian government and held advanced courses on open -source intelligence in collaboration with the Unit ed Nations Counter - Terrorism Centre and Counter -Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate. As part of the annual Malaysian Technical Cooperation Program, SEARCCT organized an online seminar on youth and terrorism for participants of 13 countries. The cen ter also hosted other for a and webinars on contemporary issues such as terrorism financing. International and Regional Cooperation: Malaysia continued to support counterterrorism efforts in regional and multilateral organizations. Malaysian officia ls participated in numerous counterterrorism events hosted by the United Nations, the Global Counterterrorism Forum, ASEAN, the ASEAN Regional Forum, the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the East Asia Summit. PHILIPPINES Overview: The Philippine government placed significant resources toward countering threats from terrorist groups that operate primarily in the country's South. Philippine military forces remained engaged in counterterrorism operations. The Philippine military, l aw enforcement, and judicial authorities participated in numerous U.S. capacity -building programs and used the training and equipment they received to prevent and respond to terrorist incidents. ISIS-East Asia remained the deadliest terrorist threat in th e Philippines, continuing to recruit, fundraise, and stage attacks on security forces and civilians alike. ISIS-East Asia factions active in 2021 -aligned Group ISIS -aligned elements of, Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), and rogue elements of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). The Philippines remained a destination for FTFs from Indonesia and Malaysia. The Communist Party of the Philippines/New People's Army (CPP/NPA) continued attacks on both security forces and civilians. The government intensified actions against CPP/NPA an d ISIS -East Asia through military operations and legal actions to cut off financing. Human rights organizations continued to raise concerns over security forces' \"red tagging\" of civil society advocates and human rights defenders as communists or terrorists or both , which has led to threats, harassment, and killings of so-called red-tagged individuals. The government's response to the COVID -19 pandemic, including strict travel regulations, limited the ability of terrorist groups to travel and conduct The government intensified actions against CPP/NPA and ISIS East Asia through military o perations and legal actions to cut off financing. Human rights organizations continued to raise concerns over security forces' \"red tagging\" of civil society advocates and human rights defenders as communists or terrorists or both, which has led to threat s, harassment, and killings of so -called red-tagged individuals. The government's response to the COVID -19 pandemic, including strict travel regulations, limited the ability of terrorist groups to travel and conduct operations. The Philippine government continued a peace process with the MILF and transitioning to the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), a semi -autonomous region established in 2019 after decades of conflict with Islamic extremist groups. The government postp oned the first BARMM regional elections , originally scheduled for 2022, until 2025. Members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority, the region's transitional government, welcomed the decision, saying that the authority needed more time to establish legisl ative and parliamentary processes. The decision drew approval from peace advocates and human rights organizations. However, some rogue MILF elements and breakaway groups \u2014 including BIFF and ISIS -East Asia \u2014 continued to oppose the peace process and conti nue attacks in the region. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: Terrorist attacks using, IEDs and small arms continued to target civilians and security forces: In June, two North Cotabato buses were bombed and torched, killing four persons . Authorities arrested Ali Akbar, a bomb maker for ISIS Affiliate Daulah Islamiya, in connection with the event. IEDs, blasting caps, and an ISIS flag were found in his posses sion. In September, eight persons were wounded by an explosion at a volleyball court in Datu Piang, Maguindanao. One victim was a 13 -year-old boy ; many others were members of the LGBTQI+ community. Authorities were unable to identify the perpetrators but believed BIFF to be behind the attack, as the group had sent death threats to local LGBTQI+ members days before. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The Antiterrorism Act (ATA), signed into law in 2020 and developed with assistance from t he United States, faced 37 petitions challenging its constitutionality in the Supreme Court, making it the most contested piece of legislation in Philippine history. Opponents of the ATA worried the law could be used against political rivals and human rig hts defenders. The government maintained that while the ATA expands the government's authority to investigate and prosecute terrorists, it will not use such powers against human rights defenders. Ultimately, the Supreme Court ruled the ATA constitutional except for two provisions. One str icken provision allowed the government to arrest protesters if they endanger the public; the court ruled the provision to be overly broad and too easily abused. The second allowed the government to consider one a terror ist based solely on determinations by the UN Security Council, without the need for the government to make its own determination. Government forces made several significant enforcement actions against terrorists and terrorist groups, including disrupt ions and arrests. In February, security forces arrested nine Abu Sayyaf members alleged to have been plotting attacks on military targets in Jolo. Security forces seized IEDs and other explosives after a raid on the suspects' homes. The members were w idows of Abu Sayyaf fighters killed in combat six months earlier , Abu Sayyaf insurgents detonated two bombs in Jolo province , killing 14 people and wounding 75 others. In October, security forces killed Salahuddin Hassan, leader of ISIS-Near East and one of the government's most wanted militants, during a raid in Maguindanao. Hassan was alleged to have planned dozens of bombings across Mindanao, most prominently orchest rating the 2016 bombing of a Davao night market that resulted in the death s of 15 people. He allegedly led other bombings, extortion, and kidnappings across the region as well as construct ed bombs for other regional militant groups \u2014 including Abu Sayyaf. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: In June , FATF placed the Philippines on its \"gr ay list,\" a registry of countries subjected to increased monitoring , to prove its progress against terrorist financing. In response to the FATF finding, the Philippines made high -level commitments to resolve strategic deficiencies outlined by FATF. Despite remaining on the gr ay list, FATF praised the Philippines in Octob er for its efforts to respond to the FATF finding; FATF gave the Philippines until 2023 to resolve all strategic deficiencies. The Philippines is a member of the Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering. Its Financial Intelligence Unit, the Anti-Money Laun dering Council, is a member of the Egmont Group. Countering Violent Extremism: The government has a National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism and has developed and implemented CVE training for security forces and civil servant s. Local governments, NGOs, and the private sector partnered on CVE programs. The Armed Forces of the Philippines worked with local stakeholders to encourage defections from the ASG, BIFF, and ISIS-Near East and to rehabilitate former terrorist fighters. The government also supported strategic communications efforts to counter terrorist messaging. The Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund provides funds for local implementers across the Philippines for programs to prevent and counter violent extremism. International and Regional Cooperation: The Philippines continued to support CT efforts in several regional and multilateral organizations, including the UN, ASEAN, ARF, ADMM, and APEC. The Philippine Navy continued joint patrols with its In donesian and Malaysian counterparts under a 2017 trilateral arrangement to combat piracy, terrorism, and the illegal drug trade. Further, the Philippines and the United States in February co-hosted with Australia the second virtual workshop in a three -workshop series for ARF members on watchlisting, aviation security, and information sharing. The Philippines is a member of the D efeat -ISIS Coalition and participates in the organization's Counter -ISIS Financing and Communications working groups. SINGAPORE Overview: Singapore continued to identify counterterrorism as the nation's top security policy priority and has a comprehensive CT strategy based on global and regional trends. The strategy included vigilant security measures, regional and international law enforcement cooperation, efforts to counter radicalization to violence, and a campaign to prepare the populace for possible attacks. Singapore was a committed, active, and effective CT partner in 2021. CT remained a pillar of the security relationship between Singaporean and U.S. law enforcement and security services. Cooperation on CT and information sharing continued during 2021. Singapore's domestic CT apparatus and its ability to detect, deter, and disrupt threats rema ined effective. The government's 2021 terrorism threat assessment report continued to identify global terrorist networks and domestically \"self -radicalized\" individuals influenced by online material as the prime terrorism threats. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in Singapore in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Singapore uses its Internal Security Act (ISA) to arrest and detain suspected terrorists. The ISA authorizes the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), with the consent of the president, to order arrests and detentions without a warrant, trial, or full judicial due process, if it is determined that individuals pose a threat to national security. There were no changes to t errorism -related legislation in 2021, but amendments to the Police Force Act passed in August enhanced the police's operational capabilities, powers, and readiness during a crisis such as terrorist incidents. Singapore detained several individuals unde r ISA for terrorism -related activities in 2021, including a 20 -year-old Singaporean in March for reportedly plotting to attack and kill Jews at a synagogue, the first plan that was allegedly motivated by the Israeli -Palestinian conflict. Singapore also de tained a Singaporean woman for allegedly supporting ISIS. Singapore released six Singaporeans who were previously detained under ISA, after assessing their rehabilitation progress and determining the individuals no longer posed a security threat that requ ired preventive detention. Singapore allowed restriction orders against seven individuals to lapse. Security forces continued to be on heightened alert and the Singapore Police Force and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) enhanced border security measures and patrols. Singapore's law enforcement and security services were capable of proactively detecting, deterring, and preventing acts of terrorism, including through interagency cooperation, regular exercises, and information sharing. Singapore maintains a \"not if, but when\" stance regarding the likelihood of terrorist attacks within the country. The government's SGSecure public awareness campaign, which aims to enhance emergency preparedness and community resilience, has used onlin e programs and training sessions during the COVID -19 global pandemic. Under SGSecure, different government agencies also reached out to various segments of the community, such as schools, workplaces, and religious organizations. To detect possible ter rorist movements by air into or transiting through the country, Singapore's primary border security agency, ICA, implemented Advance Passenger Information and Passenger Name Record data collection in 2019. ICA enhanced its border capabilities by operation alizing a multimodal biometrics clearance concept to detect fraudulent travel documents. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Singapore is a member of FATF and APG, and its Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office is a member of the Egmont Group. Singapore published its Terrorism Financing National Risk Assessment in 2020, identifying key CFT threats and vulnerabilities. There were no legislative changes in 2021, but Parliament passed an act that allowed the central bank to regulate cryptocurrencies , arguing they had a higher inherent terrorism financing risk. Singapore convicted and sentenced a Singaporean man under the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act in September to 46 months in prison for supporting ISIS with a total of $750. In Dece mber a Bangladesh i national was charged for terrorism financing for allegedly transferring $650 to support ISIS. The Monetary Authority of Singapore conducted a series of counterterrorism financing supervisory examinations of payment service providers , including remittance agents in 2021 to assess the adequacy of existing controls. Countering Violent Extremism: Through entities such as the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research and the Religious Rehabilitation Group (R RG), Singapore serves as a regional CVE hub. The government encourages interreligious and interethnic dialogue through Interracial and Religious Confidence Circles, the interagency Aftercare Group, and local community fora that bring leaders from Singapor e's religious and ethnic communities together to discuss issues of concern and build trust. The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS), the Islamic authority in charge of Muslim affairs, maintains a social media presence and holds outreach and educ ational events to counter terrorist propaganda and recruitment efforts. MUIS manages the Asatizah Recognition Scheme that vets Islamic Religious Council teachers and scholars in Singapore. RRG, a volunteer organization made up of religious scholars an d teachers, has had success in counseling detainees held under the ISA through a comprehensive program involving religious and psychological counseling. RRG also operates a resource and counseling center for the Muslim community and held virtual community events and engagement sessions during the COVID -19 pandemic, including to raise awareness about the threats of online radicalization to violence. RRG and the Inter agency Aftercare Group also conduct counter -ideology outreach activities for students and y ouths. In February , the government announced it was adjusting its rehabilitation program to include nonideological factors that led to radicalization to violence , as ISA detainees get younger. In January , the government launched the Online Industry Safet y and Security Watch Group , which enabled the police and tech companies to share information to counter terrorism, among other crime s, and the spread of violent extremist propaganda through digital platforms. International and Regional Cooperation: Singapore is an active participant in CT cooperation efforts in ASEAN, ARF, ADMM, and APEC. The nation is a strong advocate for the ASEAN \"Our Eyes\" regional initiative, which strives for ministerial -level CT information sharing. Singapore participated in the Aqaba Process Virtual Meeting in September, INTERPOL's Project Pacific working group to discuss CT issues in November, and the Third Sub regional Meeting on Counterterrorism in December . Singapore operationalized and officially opened t he Counter terrorism Information Facility in 2021, a Singapore -led initiative to increase information sharing among military and law enforcement agencies. THAILAND Overview: Thailand did not experience any attacks attributed to transnational terrorist groups in 2021 , and violence was limited to attacks attributed to ethnonationalist insurgents in the country's Deep South (the southernmost provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala and parts of Songkhla). Violence levels in the Deep South in 2021 were higher than the previous year but remained at historically low levels since the conflict reignited in 2004. There is no evidence to date of any operational linkages between domestic insurgents and international networks. The reopening of Thailand's borders and loosening of COVID -related travel restrictions has increased the risk of Thailand 's becoming a transit and facilitation hub given the high volume of travelers through Bangkok and the available market of illegal goods. Thailand re mained a productive counterterrorism partner in 2021, though the Thai government continued to focus on domestic political challenges as its primary security priority. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: Insurgent attacks and related fatalities in 2021 increased f rom the previous year but were confined to Thailand's southernmost provinces. Insurgents predominantly used small arms, IEDs, and VBIEDs. Incidents included the following : On January 31 , an IED wounded eight police officers in Narathiwat province as they responded to a suspected arson attack on a cellular communications tower. Police found three more IEDs near the scene. On February 25 , a combined IED and small arms attack killed two paramilitary rangers and wounded one in Narathiwat province. On March 19 , an IED injured six territorial defense volunteers in Yala province. On August 3 , an armed group attacked a military river outpost i n Narathiwat with grenades and small arms, killing one and wounding four others. Media reported the attack was launched from across the river in Malaysia. On September 28 , an IED killed two police officers and wounded four in Narathiwat province. During a raid in Narathiwat on the same day, two paramilitary rangers and six suspected insurgents were killed in a series of clashes. Two days later, armed men attacked a security checkpoint with IEDs and small arms, wounding a police officer, a defense volunt eer, and three villagers. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Thailand is in the process of drafting a new Counterterrorism Act, which aims to combine existing terrorism -related laws into one document, although no progress was reported i n 2021. Thailand is drafting its next four -year National Counterterrorism Strategy for preventing and responding to terrorist attacks following the conclusion of the period of performance of its 2017 -21 strategy document. Details have not been made publi c. Under the previous strategy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs maintained plans for collaboration with foreign governments. Thailand's law enforcement authorities continue to demonstrate capacity to detect, deter, and respond to terrorist incidents. Multiple entities including the Royal Thai Police, the Department of Special Investigation, and components of the Thai military have law enforcement responsibilities on counterterrorism cases. Interagency cooperation and coordination were sporadic, inform ation sharing was limited, and the delineation of duties between law enforcement and military units with counterterrorism responsibilities was unclear. Thailand's borders are relatively porous, and information sharing within Thailand and with neighbori ng countries is limited. The market in fraudulent documents remained active despite government efforts to crack down on criminal counterfeit networks. Since 2016, Thailand has collected and analyzed API/PNR data on commercial flights at all international airports. As of late 2018, Thailand's immigration system was real -time connected with INTERPOL's stolen and lost travel document database. Thailand hosted and participated in courses offered at the International Law Enforcement Academy in Bangkok, which included relevant training on narcotics investigations, media relations, leadership, financial investigations, cyber investigations, human trafficking investigations, arms trafficking investigations, wildlife trafficking investigations, tact ical safety, personnel and physical security, radiological and nuclear material detection, post -blast investigations, and border interdictions. On November 4 , the Cabinet approved Thailand's Anti -Money Laundering Office (AMLO )- proposed amendments to the anti -money -laundering law to bring it in line with international standards on countering money laundering and combating financing of terrorism. The draft bill aims to help Thailand become a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) by 2023. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Thailand belongs to the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering, a FATF -style regional body, which commits to the effective implementation and enforcement of FATF 's internationally accepted s tandards against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. AMLO is Thailand's financial intelligence unit and a member of the Egmont Group. Thailand does not have a significant unregulated informal banking and money transfer system that could aid terrorism financing activities. In cases where the central bank ( the Bank of Thailand) has discovered unauthorized remittances, it has coordinated with the police to arrest the offenders. Thailand, through AMLO, has promptly issued designation orders e ach time the UN has made a change to the list of designated persons or entities pursuant to UNSCRs 1373, 1267, and 1988, passed the updates to all relevant agencies through the electronic gateway by secure email, and published an updated consolidation of a ll designations on the AMLO website. If any transaction was found by the designated person or entity under the UNSCRs, AMLO would freeze those assets. Thailand displays a generally high level of political commitment to combating terrorist financing and d emonstrates generally good compliance. Countering Violent Extremism: The national counterterrorism strategy published in 2017 included a CVE component. Thailand lacks a national CVE action plan, but the National Security Policy and Plan published in 2019 (2019 -22) includes regionally specific security plans that focus on violent extremism. International and Regional Cooperation: Thailand is a member of regional and international multilateral fora, th rough which it participates in counterterrorism efforts, including ASEAN , ADMM , ARF , APEC , and the East Asia Summit . EUROPE Overview During 2021, Europe continued to face ongoing terrorist threats and concerns, including from U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs), racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists (REMVEs), and terrorists inspired by ISIS. ISIS proved its ideological influence, even in the absence of controlling physical territory, and continued to project its power by recruiting from European countries and inspiring attacks against symbolic European targets and public spaces. Most terrorist incidents involved simple plots with easily executable tactics, using knives, guns, or vehicles to injure or kill targets of opportunity in France, Germany, T\u00fcrkiye , and the UK. In Eastern Europe, the United States maintained many strong counterterrorism partners. While the threat of terrorism in Eastern Europe remains low, foreign terrorist groups take advantage of active illicit smuggling and trafficking networks to attempt to facilitate entry of terrorists into Europe from the Middle East and South Asia. Additi onally, Eastern European countries, especially former communist countries, have become the target of state -sponsored disinformation and propaganda, seeking to exploit societal and cultural wedge issues and strengthen extremist groups. In 2021, T\u00fcrkiye remained a transit point for FTFs departing Syria and Iraq. Also, T\u00fcrkiye expanded its counterterrorism operations in Iraq and Syria and provided counterterrorism support to Somalia. Separately, many European governments are concerned about the additional threat posed by REMVE actors. REMVE groups actively worked to engage, recruit, and radicalize to violence online. The persons motivated and inspired by these violent extremist groups and ideologies behaved as lone actors, frequently using impr ovised weapons to make attacks against individuals repeatedly criticized by the REMVE groups or identified on target lists. The lack of formal ties between the REMVE groups and lone actors significantly limited the ability of law enforcement to pursue cha rges, legal designations , or sanction s against the groups inspiring the attacks. Common themes motivated the attacks, including antivaccine sentiments, xenophobia, and socioeconomic inequality. The United States supported partners across Europe in their efforts to build counterterrorism capacity and technical assistance in aviation and border security, advisory assistance for regional security forces, countering terrorist finance, advancing criminal justice sector reforms, and training and mentoring of l aw enforcement to manage crisis response and conduct investigations. European partners undertook efforts to develop and expand regional cooperation mechanisms to detect and interdict terrorist travel and other terrorism -related activities. ALBANIA Overview: Albania continued its strong support of international counterterrorism efforts in 2021, repatriating 19 of its citizens (five women and 14 children) from displaced persons camps in Syria and engaging in the process of reintegrating and rehabilitating them throughout the year. The country has adopted national strategies on counterterrorism and countering violent extremism through 2025 and is in the process of drafting a new CVE strategy. The terrorism threat in Albania consists of FTO attempts to radicalize Albanian youth to violence, as well as Iran's state -sponsored activity directed against the Iranian opposition group Mujahedeen -e- Khaleq, members of whom resettled in Albania. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terror ist incidents in Albania in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Albania's counterterrorism laws criminalize terrorist acts. It is illegal to join a terrorist organization, receive terrorism -related training, provide material support (including financing) to a terrorist organization, travel or intend to travel to fight on behalf of a terrorist organization, or participate in a foreign army . On June 1, pursuant to an amendment to the Albanian constitution, the Special Anti -Corruption and Organized Crime Structure received sole jurisdiction over terrorism offenses . The Albanian State Police Counterterrorism Unit (CTU) worked closely with U.S. agencies to align Albanian government training and equipment requirements with U.S. exp ertise and resources, ensuring the Albanian government develops focused counterterrorism capabilities. The CTU received extensive amounts of training and equipment throughout the year from the Department of State's Antiterrorism Assistance program. The Al banian government has developed, in conjunction with international partners, contingency plans and capabilities to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks against soft targets. On August 1, Albania repatriated 19 citizens \u2014 five women and 14 children \u2014 from displaced persons camps in Syria. The Albanian government's CVE Center directed the rehabilitation and reintegration of these individuals and coordinated the efforts of various ministries, international donors, civil society members, and non -governm ental organizations to support these efforts. Corruption and barriers to information sharing among government agencies, insufficient intra - agency coordination, and weak judicial systems continued to hinder Albania's law enforcement efforts at all levels. Implementation of deep reforms in the judicial sector continues, which began with the vetting of Albania's 800 judges and prosecutors for corruption, competence, and ties to organized crime. Albania has committed to enhancing its border security and screening efforts to interdict terrorist travel, in line with international standards, and with support from U.S. experts and programs. Albanian law enforcement services cooperate extensively with INTERPOL and other international law enforcem ent bodies. Albania continues work to implement UNSCR 2396 regarding Advanced Passenger Information (API) and Passenger Name Records (PNR) data, which enhances screening of air passengers entering the country. The country has adopted a national law on AP I/PNR, and the United States and Albania solidified commitment to deepen cooperation in support of implementing this law. Albania sustains a port security oversight system to comply with requirements under the International Maritime Organization's Interna tional Ship and Port Facility Security Code. Albania has implemented a stricter prison regime for dangerous convicts, called Article 41 -bis of the Prison Administration Act. The country also is an active bilateral partner on watchlisting development thro ugh the CT Bureau - funded WASP. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Albania is a member of the Council of Europe's Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti -Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism (MONEYVAL), a Financial Action Task Force (FATF) -style regional body. Albania's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the General Directorate for the Prevention of Money Laundering, is a member of the Egmont Group. Albania's FIU works to prevent and combat money laundering and financing of terrorism. Because of deficiencies in its Anti -Money Laundering/Countering Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime, Albania has been on MONEYVAL's \"enhanced follow up status\" since 2018. In 2020, FATF added Albania to its gr ay list of countr ies with strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing. The country continued to work with FATF and MONEYVAL to address these deficiencies, but MONEYVAL reported in May that Albania has not significantly improved measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing in line with FATF recommendations. MONEYVAL decided that Albania should remain in the enhanced follow -up procedure and report back on further progress to strengthe n its implementation of AML/CFT measures annually . Countering Violent Extremism: The Government of Albania has a national CVE strategy through 2025 and is in the process of drafting a new strategy. The National CVE Center coordinates and manages CVE programming among international donors and seeks to ensure all ministries cooperate effectively and avoid duplication of efforts. The capital Tirana, as well as the cities of Bulqiz \u00eb, C\u00ebrrik, Elbasan, and Librazhd are members of the Strong Cities Network. The Albanian State Police has incorporated CVE into the portfolios of 26 community police units around the country. The chiefs of these units received training from the U.S. government and implement projects with local government counterparts aimed at d etecting and countering terrorist radicalization efforts. Embassy Tirana supports CVE efforts with a wide range of assistance programs and diplomatic engagement, including to local community groups that identify and mitigate factors underlying violent e xtremism. Albania is on the board of GCERF, which has three local partners in the country that work on CVE issues: the Institute for Democracy and Mediation, the Counseling Line for Women, and Terre des Hommes. Embassy Tirana oversees the implementati on of the fourth iteration of a CVE grant to the Muslim Community of Albania , which includes engagement by Islamic clergy with at -risk youth s and their parents to steer youth s away from paths to radicalization to violence and informing them about democrati c principles, human rights, civic duties, and tolerance. International and Regional Cooperation: Albania is a member of the Adriatic Council, the Council of Europe, NATO, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the OSCE, the Regional Cooperation Counc il for Southeast Europe, the United Nations, and the International Center of Excellence for Countering Violent Extremism ( Hedayah ). In 2021 it served as a nonpermanent member of the UN Security Council. Albanian criminal -justice officials participated regularly in various regional associations, conferences, and other counterterrorism information -sharing exchanges. AUSTRIA Overview: U.S.-Austrian law enforcement cooperation remained strong. U.S. law enforcement agencies continued to as sist in investigations of the 2020 terrorist attack in Vienna , during which a 20-year-old Austrian of North Macedonia origin killed four persons and injured 23 others . Parliament passed additional counterterrorism legislation, including on Hizballah, providing additional funding of $137 million for 2021 -24, and $5.8 million to fight cybercrime. Parliament also passed legislation to reform the Federal Office for the P rotection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism, Austria's key counterterrorism agency within the Interior Ministry, and replaced it December 1 with the Directorate for Security and Intelligence (DSN). Reforms included increased staffing of the agency' s \"extremism \" section and hiring more highly qualified personnel. DSN's new chief said in late 2021 that \"radical elements \" exploiting protests against C OVID -19 restrictions constituted one of Austria's top security concerns. Other counterterrorism raids and investigations focused on \"Islamist extremism,\" alleged members of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the \"right -wing extremist scene,\" which promoted anti -Muslim and antimigrant violence. Austrian courts continued to impose stiff prison sentences for convi cted \"Islamist terrorists. \" The DSN monitors an estimated 90 p eople who returned to Austria from conflict zones, and the Interior Ministry estimated at the end of 2021 that 100 Austrian FTFs were still in Syria and Iraq. Overall, Austrian officials note that \"Islamist terrorist\" mobilization substantially declined after 2015. Austria is a member of the Defeat -ISIS Coalition's Foreign Terrorist Fighters and Stabilization working groups, with emphases on stabilization, the problem of FTFs , and countering violent extremism. Law enforcement agencies focused on intelligence gathering and investigations, as well as on sharing information with international partners. Austria has contributed significant humanitarian aid and separate funding fo r stabilization related to D efeat -ISIS efforts. Austria maintains an embassy in Damascus (the ambassador is accredited to Lebanon and Syria and based in Beirut, traveling periodically to Damascus) . 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terror ist incidents in Austria in 2021. Investigations continued into the aforementioned 2020 terrorist attack in Vienna by the 20-year- old Austrian of North Macedonian origin . Police killed the attacker. Since the attack, investigators determined the terrori st acted alone but received encouragement from four ISIS sympathizers, and he received material support, including assistance obtaining ammunition, from three others. Authorities are holding these seven accomplices in pretrial detention. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Parliament passed sweeping counterterrorism legislation in 2021 in response to th at 2020 terrorist attack. The legislation provided more staff, funding, and legal tools for justice and law enforcement au thorities to detain, prosecute, and deradicalize potential terrorists. The legislation also increased resources for monitoring and deradicalization of convicted terrorists, allowed electronic tracking of released offenders, and prohibited them from visiti ng certain potentially radicalizing sites (e.g., some specific mosques). It also allowed authorities to strip dual -national convicts of Austrian citizenship, expanded oversight of mosques and financing of Muslim institutions, and banned symbols of Hizball ah and the \"right -wing extremist \" Identitarians. The law also tightened legislative loopholes against terrorism financing and brought Austrian legislation in line with EU directive 2018/1673 on combating money laundering in criminal law. In November , an appellate court declared the 2020 raids by Austrian authorities against suspected members of the Muslim Brotherhood illegitimate in 10 cases and concluded that related property seizures and confiscations in those cases also were illegal. Investigations continue against other suspects charged in th ose raids. Austrian law enforcement and DSN officials routinely cooperated with U.S. law enforcement in a range of areas, including joint investigative projects and enforcement operations. Austria has taken a whole -of-government approach to implement UN Security Council resolutions on counterterrorism as well as the Global Counterterrorism Forum Good Practices on Addressing the Challenge of Returning Families of FTFs . Austrian law punishes \"travel for terrorism purposes\" with prison sentences of six months to five years, extends domestic jurisdiction to individuals in Austria who committed a crime abroad, and ensures legal counsel for terror victims. This law implements the EU Directive on Combating Te rrorism and the UN's International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. In 2021 , Austria extended temporary border checks with its Schengen Zone neighbor countries, introduced in 2016, and announced it was adding 1,000 soldiers at its eastern borders to thwart increased illegal border crossings. Regulations allow border authorities to prevent minors from leaving Austria on suspicion they would participate in foreign fighting activities. Border security forces continued to make effective use of security measures, including biographic and biometric screening at ports of entry, and information sharing internally and with other EU countries. Austria's rigorous processes to register and screen individuals applying for asylum, lawful residence , and citizenship remained unchanged in 2021. EU and Austrian privacy statutes occasionally limit Austria's ability to fully utilize tools available through international cooperation. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Austria is a member FATF. The Austrian Financial Intelligence Unit is a member of the Egmont Group. Related legislation aims to close loopholes in Austria's laws against financing of terrorism and bring them into conformity with pertinent EU legislation. Countering Violen t Extremism: Austrian, Belgian, Danish, and French government representatives announced joint cooperation projects in fighting radicalization and Islamist extremism at a Vienna conference in October, and Austria announced it would also seek similar cooper ative arrangements with other countries. Efforts in combating what the Austrian government has called \"political Islam\" have been controversial, including the establishment of a Documentation Office on Political Islam in 2020 and the government's publication of an \"Islam Map\" identifying the locations of Muslim institutions in Austria. Austria's national action plan on Extremism Prevention and De radicalization calls for improved networking among law enforcement agencies and c ivil society institutions; extension of exit programs for individuals radicalized to violence ; better \"transition management\" through decoupling of terrorism convicts from their terrorist communities; increased civics and democracy education in schools; re search on extremist and antidemocratic movements; providing counternarratives to radicalization myths through information campaigns; and inclusion of the findings of the Documentation Office on Political Islam . The Ministry of European and International Affairs continued its cooperation with the Islamic faith community to conduct information campaigns in mosques, Islamic organizations, community centers, and prisons. International and Regional Cooperation: Austria hosted Western Balkan leaders in June to discuss measures against terrorism, organized crime, and illegal migration. Austria participates in Eurojust's EU -wide register, which lists ongoing terrorism investigations by EU member states. Austria has m embership in the following organizations : The UN The EU The Council of Europe The OSCE The Salzburg Forum The Central European Initiative The Western Balkans Counter Terrorism Initiative BELGIUM Overview: Belgium had an active counterterrorism policy that included robust domestic security efforts, international information sharing , and support for multilateral efforts. The country's greatest terrorism threat remained homegrown terrorism carried out by lone actors, whether inspired by Islamist violent extremism or, to a lesser extent, racially or ethnically motivated violent extremis m, which Belgium calls \"violent right -wing extremism.\" The general threat level during 2021 remained at 2 on a four-point scale, with 4 the most severe. During the COVID -19 pandemic, authorities noted an increase in \"right -wing extremist propaganda ,\" especially online. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorist attacks in Belgium during 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Belgium's primary CT -related agencies included the Ministries of Defense, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Interior, and Justice, together with both federal and local police, the civilian and military security and intelligence services, the Office of the Federal Prosecutor, the Financial Intelligence Processing Unit, and the National Security Council. The Mini stry of Interior maintained a Crisis Center. An interagency body called the Coordination Unit for Threat Analysis (CUTA), comprising representatives of the relevant ministries, was responsible for setting nationwide threat -level ratings and maintaining Be lgium's database of individuals with a nexus to terror. Belgium's law enforcement capacity, although underfunded, was capable and experienced in responding to and deterring terrorist activity. During 2021, CUTA was reportedly tracking about 675 people for links to terrorism, of whom about 50 were in the category of violent right -wing extremism and about 15 in the category of \"violent left -wing extremism.\" The majority of the remaining were link ed to Islamic extremism. Belgian law enforcement took actions to disrupt potential terrorist actions. Some examples include the following : In March, Belgian police arrested four minors who had been radicalized to violence by online jihadist propaganda and who were at various stages of plotting terrorist attacks. The four were not working together. On May 17 , a former Belgian special forces soldier, Jurgen Conings, left behind a note that threatened violence against health experts and politicians and disappeared with a significant arsenal of military weapons . His body was found five weeks later after a three -country manhunt, dead of an apparent suicide. The case exposed poor controls and communication between the military intelligence and operational sectors. On July 9, Defense Minister Ludivine Dedonder fired the head of military intelligence and promised i mproved vigilance and controls to prevent persons with known far -right views from becoming violent threat s. For 2021, Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden announced a budget increase of $5.8 million supporting the recruitment of 1,600 new staff, includin g police officers. For 2021, Justice Minister Vincent Van Quickenborne announced a $322 million increase to hire 1,400 new staff and ensure \"a faster justice process,\" representing a 15 percent augmentation over the Federal Public Service Justice's 2020 b udget. In mid -2021 , the justice minister and the director of state security announced an additional increase of more than $10 million specifically for hiring staff and modernizing the state security computer infrastructure. During 2021, Belgium's Parliament did not pass any legislation that would alter Belgium's ability to investigate, prosecute, or deter terrorism. Challenges to effective counterterrorism efforts continued to include Belgium's complex government; the difficulty of information sharing between various agencies; data collection and retention regulations; s hort prison sentences; and bureaucratic hurdles to the full use of civil informants. Belgium implemented UNSCR 2396 through, among other actions, the implementation of the EU PNR directive for air travelers, through its aggressive prosecution of known FTF s, often in absentia, and through its maintenance of databases to track known and suspected terrorists. Belgium's Passenger Information Unit made a significant contribution to travel -related information analysis. On July 17, pursuant to a policy change a nnounced in March, Belgium repatriated six female FTFs with their 10 children from northeastern Syria. This was the first government -initiated repatriation of adult FTFs, motivated mostly by concern for the children. There remained about 20 adults and 20 children with a claim to Belgian citizenship in camps/detention in northeastern Syria. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Belgium has been a member of FATF since 1990. Its FIU, the Belgian Financial Intelligence Processing Unit, is a member of t he Egmont Group. Belgium is also a member of the Counter -ISIS Finance Group (CIFG). In 2006, in response to UNSC 1373, the country created a domestic designation regime that allows it to freeze the assets of listed terrorists. Belgium has implemented the EU's Fourth and Fifth Anti - Money Laundering Directives. Countering Violent Extremism: In 2021, Belgium replaced its plan to counter radicalization to violence, \"Plan R,\" with a new counterterrorism strategy. Known as \"StrategyTer,\" the new plan expand s the strategy to include far -right and far -left extremism. It better incorporates the various federal, regional, and community actors in concentrating on preventing violent extremism. The plan reinforces the local task forces established under Plan R to coordinate the CVE response among local security, municipal, NGO, and social services personnel. During 2021 , the Belgian cities of Antwerp, Li\u00e8ge, and Vilvoorde remained part of the Strong Cities Network and participated in a CT -sponsored CVE workshop f ollowing up on their City Pair exchanges, as did the city of Verviers. International and Regional Cooperation : Belgium participated in CT efforts with the EU, NATO, the OSCE, and the Council of Europe, and it was a member of the advisory board of the UN Counterterrorism Center. The country was also an active contributor to the subcommittees of the UNSC responsible for counterterrorism. Belgium was a troop -contributing member of Operation Inherent Resolve in Jordan, the European Union Training Mission in Mali, and the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali. Belgium participated in all EU efforts to interdict FTF travel across land and maritime borders, encouraged efforts to strengthen Schengen Zone external borders, and maintained a leading role in the European Strategic Communication Network. The nation was not a member of the GCTF but often participated as an observer. CUTA represents Belgium on the newly created EU Network of Prevent Policy -Makers, which is primarily dedicated to the fight against violent extremism. In addition to the CIFG , Belgium is a member of the Stabilization, Communications, and Foreign Terrorist Fighter Working Groups in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA Overview: Bosnia and Herzegovina remained a cooperative counterterrorism partner, although its capacity remains limited and little progress was made on legal and regulatory reforms because of the ongoing political crisis caused b y secessionist rhetoric and obstruction of state - level institutions by Republika Srpska entity leaders and federation entity dysfunction attributable to Croat and Bosniak tensions and concentration on narrow political interests. There were no known registered Bosnia and Herzegovina citizens who attempted to travel to foreign battlefields in 2021, although some FTFs and family members remain in Iraq and Syria. Bosnia and Herzegovina continues to be a willing partner in repatriation of FTFs, and in July established an interagency coordinating body to oversee future repatriation efforts. On CT investigations, interpersonal and interagency infighting and stovepiping undermine fully effective cooperati on. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The adoption of a new national Strategy for the Prevention and the Fight Against Terrorism 2020 -24 remains delayed despite the previous strategy's expiration in 2020. In May the Bosnia and Herzegovina Council of Ministers appointed an interagency working group to draft the new strategy, which is still under way. In March the Bosnia and Herzegovina Ministry of Security formed an interagency coordination body to develop a plan for the repatriation, pros ecution, or reintegration of alleged FTFs and their family members in Iraq and Syria. The Coordination Body was finalizing the whole -of-government plan at the end of 2021. The Ministry of Security CT Section increased staffing with the appointment of an assistant minister and a new head of CT. The State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) continued to be the lead law enforcement unit performing CT functions; however, its effectiveness was limited owing to poor cooperation with the State Prosecutor 's Office (SPO) and, at times, poor investigatory practices. Moreover, Bosnia and Herzegovina does not have clear regulations and guidelines that govern cooperation among prosecutors, law enforcement, and the intelligence community in national security investigations. The SPO and SIPA continued to receive training provided by the Department of State's ATA program ; by the U.S. Department of Justice's ( DOJ's) Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training program (OPDAT ) and DOJ's International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program ; and the U.S. Department of Defen se's Special Operations Command Europe. In 2021, limited in -person trainings restarted. An SPO -led task force met three times in 2021, but law enforcement cooperation at a more strategic level continued to suffer because of an ongoing political crisis and from the impediments of Bosnia and Herz egovina 's complex governmental structure. Political leadership often failed to support implementing U.S. -funded initiatives despite a desire from law enforcement professionals. Ongoing disagreements over state-versus -entity competencies prevented progres s on updating laws and regulations governing the collection and use of airline passenger information in line with international standards. There was some progress, however, on updating border security and screening systems and technology. The Foreigners' Affairs Service continues to enhance efforts to screen irregular migrants for links to terrorism. In 2021, five FTFs who had repatriated to Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2019, were convicted and sentenced to between one and six years. The SPO also indicted another FTF who was repatriated from T\u00fcrkiye in 2020. However, the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina acquitted this defendant of all charges. A trial of a defendant indicted for the public incitement of terrorist activities in late 2020 commenced in 2021 and is ongoing. DOJ's OPDAT provided case -based mentoring and guidance to Bosnia and Herzegovina partners in these investigations and prosecutions. Countering th e Financing of Terrorism: Bosnia and Herzegovina is a member of MONEYVAL. Its FIU, the Financial Intelligence Department, is a member of the Egmont Group. Because of the current political crisis, little progress was made in updating Bosnia and Herzegovi na's Anti -Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism legislation. Bosnia and Herzegovina also did not complete its National Risk Assessment , as required by MONEYVAL. Bosnia and Herzegovina initiated its first Financing of Terrorism case i n 2021 involving a dual Bosnia and Herzegovina and Swiss citizen who allegedly provided funds to her husband, a member of ISIS fighting in Syria at the time. While the indictment is a sign of some progress for Bosnia and Herzegovina , the SPO still needs to develop its capacity to investigate terrorist financing cases. Additionally, the Bosnia and Herzegovina judiciary still tends to treat alleged terrorist s lightly. This is especially true with female defendants whom Bosnia and Herzegovina authori ties almost universally disregard as possible criminals. There were no designations for asset freezing based on UNSCRs in 2021, although in December Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities received training from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC ) and OSCE on how to nominate entities for UN terrorism -related sanctions, and Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities were working with DOJ to submit multiple nominations. Countering Violent Extremism: Violent e xtremist ideology and violent regional nationalist groups remain potential sources of terrorism in Bosnia and Herzegovina . In 2021, the political crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina brought about unprecedented divisive rhetoric by the country's ethnonational ist political leaders. At the same time, the main religious communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Catholic, Islamic, Jewish, and Orthodox) continued to work together through the Interreligious Council in Bosnia and Herzegovina to promote tolerance and confront acts of bigotry or violence directed at any of these communities. Religious communities noted that Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities failed to tap into the expertise of religious communities in countering violent extremism or deradicalizing return ees from Syria and Iraq. In 202 1, USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives completed its programming to prevent and counter violent extremism programming. International and local actors working on countering radicalization made significant efforts in bro adening their analysis beyond radical Islam to include extreme ethnonationalism and foreign influence, as well as domestic drivers are members of the Strong Cities Network. International and Regional Cooperation: The SPO continues to work with the United States, regional neighbors, and EU countries on CT investigations. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a member of or participating state in the UN, the OSCE, the Regional Cooperation Council for Southeast Europe, the Council of Europe. BULGARIA Overview: Bulgaria remained a strong counterterrorism partner of the United States. While the threat of terrorism in Bulgaria remains low, foreign terrorist groups take advantage of Bulgaria's active illicit smuggling and trafficking networks to attempt to facili tate entry of terrorists into Europe from the Middle East and South Asia. In 2021 , the government continued counterterrorism capacity building and maintained close cooperation with U.S. government agencies, though capability gaps continued to hinder overa ll effectiveness. Given Bulgaria's strategic location as a crossroads between Europe and the Middle East, most of Bulgaria's CT efforts focus on disrupting FTF transit through enhanced border security activities, traveler screening, and information sharin g. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorist attacks reported in Bulgaria in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The State Agency for National Security (DANS) is the lead for counterterrorism in Bulgaria. A separate National Counterterrorism Center , operating within DANS since 2014, aims to identify suspects, exchange information, and disrupt terrorist activities. The State Intelligence Agency also contains a small, primarily analytic CT capability and an equally sma ll operational capability focused on threats to Bulgarian interests abroad. The Ministry of Interior contains a separate Special Weapons and Tactics team focused internally on domestic threats. Throughout 2021, Bulgaria continued to conduct effective co unterterrorism activities at its borders, executing strong migration control programs, U.S. -enabled biographic and biometric screening programs, and information sharing with the U nited States and other partners to identify and apprehend terrorist suspects crossing the borders or illegally residing in the country. Throughout the reporting period, U.S. government agencies worked closely with Bulgarian counterparts through a variety of border -focused CT capacity building programs. For example, the Departments of Homeland Security and State partnered with Bulgaria to implement screening programs in border and aviation security. In 2021, two caretaker governments were responsible for eight months of the reporting period. As such, no major legislative changes occurred related to counterterrorism. Rather, political instability went hand in hand with uncertainty over the status of Specialized Criminal Courts with jurisdiction over terrorism cases. Judges and prosecutors in the specialized courts were ill - equipped to prosecute terrorists as they worked under legislative gaps and deficiencies. Notable terrorism cases included the following: In February, prosecutors indicted Bulgarian national of Syrian descent Mohammed Abdulkader for actively supporting terrorism in Syria as a foreign terrorist fighter. Authorities reported Abdulkader's father recruited him, and he traveled to Syria five times from 2017 through 2019 to fight with terrorist groups in Aleppo. In December , the Specialized Criminal Court issued a six -month suspended sentence against a minor who was arrested in 2019 at age 16 in Plovdiv on charges of plotting a terrorist attack using homemade IEDs , which he built using ISIS online tutorials. He reportedly was unaffiliated with any terrorist group. Countering Terrorist Financing: In September , the Bulgarian government adopted an action plan targeting terrorist financing and money laundering. The government based this plan on an interagency working group national risk assessment \u2014 a first of its kind \u2014 finalized in 2020. There were no incidents of cases involving terror financing in Bulgaria. Countering Violent Extremism: The government is implementing its 2020 revision of the 2015 -25 Strategy for Countering Radicalization and Terrorism. The aim is to prevent \"forced radicalization \"; combat \"radical propaganda \" and terrorist recruitment; prevent terrorist activity within Bulgaria; prosecute terrorist activities, leaders, and enablers involved in \"radicalization \" or terrorist activities in Bulgaria or abroad; minimize the effects of terrorist activities; and build societal trust and support for CT and CVE programs and activities. In February the Plovdiv Appellate Court confirmed the P azardjik District Court's 2019 verdict against preacher Ahmed Mussa and 11 other Romani Muslims on charges of supporting ISIS, assisting foreign terrorist fighters, and \"propagating Salafi Islam,\" which the court characterized as an \"antidemocratic ideolog y and incitement to war.\" International and Regional Cooperation: Bulgaria is a member of and active contributor to CT initiatives at the UN, the EU, NATO, the OSCE, the Council of Europe, and the Organization for Black Sea Economic Cooperation. CYPRUS Overview: The Republic of Cyprus collaborated closely with the United States, the EU, and other countries \u2014 bilaterally and multilaterally \u2014 in international counterterrorism efforts in 2021. Since 1974 , the island of Cyprus has been de facto di vided into the Republic of Cyprus government -controlled area in the southern two thirds of the island, and the northern third administered by the Turkish Cypriots (TCs). A UN peacekeeping force patrols a buffer zone, also called the \"Green Line,\" that separates the two sides. The buffer zone is largely open to civilian traffic and remains a significant route for the illicit transit of persons , narcotics, and other contraband. The division of the island has impeded counterterrorism cooperation between the two communities and between the Republic of Cyprus and T\u00fcrkiye , which do not maintain diplomatic relations. This report covers only the Republic of Cyprus . It does not address terrorism or counterterrorism efforts in the areas under the administration of TCs. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in the Republic of Cyprus in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There were no changes since 2020 to the Republic of Cyprus legal system a s it pertains to counterterrorism. Republic of Cyprus authorities arrested six individuals suspected of planning an attack on a prominent businessman residing in Cyprus. The individuals were charged with terrorism and are awaiting trial. In January , the Department of State's Export Control and Border Security program began construction of a U.S. -funded training facility, known as the Cyprus Center for Land, Open - seas, and Port Security (CYCLOPS). This $7.5 million facility will strengthen regional border security, counterterrorism, and nonproliferation efforts, including customs and export controls, port and maritime security, countering weapons of mass destruction (WMD) , counter -improvised explosive device training, and cybersecurity. CYCLOPS was exp ected to open in 2022. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: The Republic of Cyprus is a member of FATF and MONEYVAL. In December, MONEYVAL released its first enhanced follow -up report to its 2019 Mutual Evaluation Report . The follow -up report found the Republic of Cyprus to be compliant with 16 FATF recommendations, largely compliant with 20, and partially compliant with four. The Republic of Cyprus has no \"noncompliant\" ratings. The Republic of Cyprus 's Financial Inte lligence Unit, known as the Unit for Combating Money Laundering ( and as MOKAS), is a member of the Egmont Group. Countering Violent Extremism: There were no significant changes in Cyprus's CVE efforts in 2021. International and Regional Cooperation: The Republic of Cyprus participates in regional and multinational counterterrorism exercises with partners including Egypt, Greece, Israel, Jordan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. DENMARK Overview: The Kingdom of Denmark, which includes Greenland and the Faroe Islands, remained an important U.S. partner in the global fight against terrorism. As an active participant in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and the Global Counterterrorism Forum, Denm ark cooperated closely with the United States on counterterrorism initiatives. Denmark devoted significant assets to counterterrorism programs and countering violent extremism initiatives, domestically and abroad. According to the Center for Terror Ana lysis (CTA), administered by the Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET), the terror threat to Denmark remained \"significant,\" the fourth of a five -level ranking system ( minimal, limited, general, significant, and very significant ). The CTA charact erized the terror threat to Greenland and the Faroe Islands as \"minimal.\" CTA assessed that the primary threat to Denmark was attacks perpetrated by individuals in Denmark and abroad who sympathize with and are inspired by what PET labels as \"foreign militant Islamist terrorist groups,\" including ISIS and al-Qa'ida. According to PET, at least 160 individuals from Denmark have traveled to Iraq or Syria to join \"militant Islamist groups\" since 2012. Nearly half of these individuals have either returned to Denmark or relocated to another country. PET also characterized the domestic terrorist threat from what the government terms \"right -wing extremists\" as \"general.\" While CTA assessed the COVID -19 pandemic was not a driver of terrorism in Denmark in 2021, it notes it is likely the pandemic has contributed to strengthening existing anti -government narratives among right -wing extremists. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorist incidents in the Kingdom of Denmark reported in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The Danish National Police are responsible for law enforcement services in all regions governed by the Kingdom of Denmark, including Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Denmark continues to use its 2006 terrorism legislation that allows information sharing between its agencies responsible for counterterrorism and foreign terrorist fighters \u2014 PET and the Danish Defense Intelligence Service (DDIS). Efforts to counter terrorism also are shared among the Danish Police, the Public Prosecution Service, and the Danish Prison and Probation Service. Danish security and law enforcement agencies share information through the CTA, which \u2014 as the Danish government's intelligence fusion center \u2014 constitutes the focal poi nt for reporting from the Danish National Police, PET, DDIS, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Danish Emergency Management Agency. The Danish police and the Danish defense forces share responsibility for preventing terrorist attacks in Copenhagen a nd along the borders. PET arrested 13 individuals in Denmark on February 6 and 8 who were charged with planning one or more terrorist attacks or being accessory to attempted terrorism. In September, Danish courts sentenced Danish citizen Abdullah Akbul ut to 10 years in prison for planning a terrorist attack after his 2020 arrest and charged him with attempted terrorism. Akbulut, who also holds Turkish citizenship, was stripped of his Danish citizenship and will be deported with a permanent ban on reent ry once he completes his prison sentence. In August , a Danish woman was sentenced to five years in prison for having travel ed to Syria in 2016 to join ISIS. She also was charged with helping recruit a family member to join ISIS. She has been in custody since her arrest at Copenhagen Airport in 2020. In October , the government repatriated three Danish citizen mothers , along with their 14 Danis h citizen children , from northeastern Syria with the assistance of the United States. The three mothers were arrested on arrival and charged with promoting terrorism. PET maintains it is unlikely that repatriating the children would pose a terrorist thre at, not ing that this would depend on whether the government offers them deradicalization and reintegration support. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Denmark is a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international money laundering and terrorist financing monitoring organization. Its Financial Intelligence Unit, the Money Laundering Secretariat, is a member of the Egmont Group. FATF's February report recommended that Greenland and the Faroe Islands strengthen their anti -money laundering and terrorist financing measures to address the vulnerabilities of the territories. Denmark is also a member of the Defeat -ISIS Counter - ISIS Finance Group. Countering Violent Extremism: Established in 2017 , the Danish Centre for Prevention of Extremism is responsible for preventing extremism nationally, locally, and virtually. Aarhus, Copenhagen, Gentofte, Guldborgsund, and Viborg are members of the Strong Cities Network . Denmark was also a contributor to the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund. International and Regional Cooperation: Much of Denmark's multilateral engagement to prevent and combat terrorism is guided by the UN 's Global Counter terrorism Strategy, which was most recently revised in June. Denmark continued to strongly support counterterrorism efforts in regional and multilateral organizations, including the Global Counterterrorism Forum, NATO, the Council of Europe , the OSCE, INTERPOL, Club de Berne, and the European Counterterrorism Center. Denmark also is among the founding members of the Defeat -ISIS Coalition and is in the Foreign Terrorist Fighter, Counter -ISIS Finance, Stabilization, and Communications Working Groups. Denmark continued to lead the NATO Mission Iraq in 2021. Throughout 2021, Denmark continued to contribute personnel to the UN peacekeeping mission in Mali and the French -led counterterrorism mission in the Sahel. Denmark also contributed troops to the NATO -led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan before withdr awing in June. FRANCE Overview: France is a key partner of the United States in the global fight against terrorism. Bilateral U.S. -France counterterrorism cooperation is strong. France is a longstanding and important member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. The terrorist threat in France remained high. Security services were concerned by lone -actor attacks carried out by individuals already in France, including th ose inspired by or affiliated with ISIS. French officials also were concerned by right -wing extremists able to form cells and organize attacks. The government adopted new laws to enhance the government's ability to tackle what it described as Islamist se paratism, and to make permanent some of the security measures temporarily imposed under the State of Emergency following the 2015 terrorist attacks. French law enforcement and intelligence agencies thwarted at least five attacks in 2021 and arrested at le ast 50 individuals, including 19 linked to REMVE actors. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: At least two suspected terrorist attacks took place in 2021, with limited casualties : On April 23 , a Tunisian national stabbed and killed a police employee while shouting \"Allhu 'akbar\" outside a police station in a suburb of Paris. Police shot and killed him. The National CT Prosecutor's Office is investigating the case. On November 8 , an Algeria n national attacked two police officers with a knife, injuring one, in Cannes. The suspect reportedly carried out the attack \"in the name of the Prophet [Muhammad].\" Police shot and injured the assailant. The investigation in ongoing. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: On August 24, France adopted the law \"Upholding Respect for Principles of the Republic,\" also known as the \"Anti - Separatism\" law, to address concerns that radical Islamists had created parallel societies that indoctrinated members with ideas contrary to the values of the French Republic. France adopted the Counterterrorism and Intelligence Law on July 30 , which expand s the terrorism prevention tools available to security agencies and ma kes permanent some of the temporary measures imposed by the 2015 State of Emergency, including search and seizures, the use of algorithms to analyze internet browsing data, home visits for suspected terrorist or radicalized individuals, and closures of \"suspicious\" religious places found to promote radical Islam or terrorist ideology. The CT and Intelligence Law also allows the government to impose additional \"administrative\" measures for up to five years on certain convicted terrorists following their prison release. An es timated 59 terrorist inmates completed their prison sentence and were released in 2021. France has robust law enforcement and intelligence services that detect, deter, and prevent acts of terrorism on its territory. The Internal Security General Directorate is the lead agency for the fight against terrorism and violent extremism, coordinatin g with all other relevant intelligence and law enforcement services. The French armed forces continued Operation Sentinel, a domestic deployment of up to 7,000 soldiers who enhance security at sensitive sites and large events throughout the country. Fr ance has a fully operational interministerial API/PNR capability to screen arriving and departing passenger data against other police and administrative databases. France maintained its longstanding policy against the repatriation of French FTFs, repatr iating minor children of FTFs on a case -by-case basis. As of December, France had repatriated a total of 35 minors \u2014 with the last operation conducted in January 2021 . An estimated 300 French FTFs and their family members have returned to France in accor d with a 2014 French -Turkish agreement whereby T\u00fcrkiye coordinates with France to deport French nationals believed to have entered T\u00fcrkiye from Syria. All adult FTFs returning to France have been systematically prosecuted since 2016. Minors, depending on their age, may face legal action if they are suspected of having participated in terrorist activities. Minors not believed to have participated in terrorist activities are enrolled in an extensive rehabilitation and reintegration program. High -profile t errorist cases in the judicial system included the following : On September 8 , the Special Criminal Court opened the trial for the 2015 coordinated terrorist attacks at the Bataclan concert hall and other sites. Twenty men, including five presumed dead, are accused of involvement in the coordinated attacks that killed 130 people, i ncluding one American. France cooperated with U.S. government agencies as part of the investigations. One U.S. victim is a witness in the trial. On September 21 , the Special Criminal Court of Appeals increased Tyler Vilus's sentence to life in prison for overseeing the executions of prisoners in Syria from 2013 through 2015. On February 3 , the Riom Court of Appeals ordered the release from prison of Algerian national Kamel Daoudi. Daoudi was sentenced in 2020 to one year in prison for violating the ter ms of his house arrest. Daoudi was convicted in 2005 for planning a 2001 terrorist attack against Embassy Paris and had been under house arrest since 2008 until his incarceration. On April 14 , the Paris Court of Appeals ruled to pave the way for a trial to look into the 1982 anti-Semetic terrorist attack in Paris that left six dead, including two U.S. citizens. Norwegian national Walid Abdulrahman Abou Zayed, a suspected shooter, was extradite d to France in 2020. France observed a rise in what it calls \"far -right extremism \" or \"politically motivated terrorism.\" There were at least five far -right terrorist plots that French services thwarted since 2017. The National Anti terrorism Prosecutor 's office investigated at least six far -right terrorist cases that involved 55 individuals. The n eo-Nazi group Honor and Nation reportedly targeted government officials, a freemason lodge, and COVID -19 vaccination centers and called for a coup d'\u00e9tat under the leadership of R\u00e9my Daillet. On August 26 , a far-right man was arrested in Colmar for fabricating four pipe bombs with pieces of uranium purchased online. On November 23, 13 members of far -right group Recolonization France were arrested throughout France following the police discovery of a weapons cache and numerous neo - Nazi objects. In a February 3 ruling, a court in Besan\u00e7on convicted neo -Nazi Philippe Tribout to two years in prison for carrying out a racially motivated attack on Febr uary 1 against a man of Arab origin. The Paris Correctional Court convicted six far -right extremists of terrorism, sentencing them to five to nine years in prison on October 12. The government banned at least two far -right associations, including G\u00e9n\u00e9rat ion Identitaire and Alvarium. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: France is a member of FATF, and France's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) Tracfin is a member of the Egmont Group. France also is a member of the Defeat -ISIS Counter -ISIS Finance Group. France continued to investigate and prosecute financing of terrorism cases in 2021. In June, six family members of a 2015 Bataclan terrorist were arrested for financing terrorism. France is also a member of the Counter -ISIS Finance Workin g Group for the Defeat -ISIS Coalition. Countering Violent Extremism: As part of its efforts to counter Islamist separatism, the government announced it would end foreign government funding of imams from Algeria, Morocco , and T\u00fcrkiye within four years, re placing this program with imams trained within France. France increased scrutiny of religious schools to identify and close \"illegal schools\" run by \"religious extremists.\" Since 2020 , the government had shuttered 21 mosques for ties to radical Islam. Out of 2,500 mosques in France, 92 have suspected ties to radical Islam. Bordeaux, Montreuil, Paris, Sarcelles, and Strasbourg are members of the Strong Cities Network. International and Regional Cooperation: France is a founding member of the GCTF and is active on the UN Security Council ISIL and al -Qa'ida Sanctions Committee. France undertook joint CT operations with several EU partners and played an active role in CT capacity building in West Africa's Sahel region with the Coalition for the Sahel and Task Force Takuba. The nation is a major contributor to the D efeat -ISIS Coalition and is a member of the Foreign Terrorist Fighter, Counter -ISIS Finance, Stabilization, and Communications Working Groups. GEORGIA Overview: Georgia continued its robust engagement on counterterrorism issues in 2021 and remained a strong U.S. security partner. The terrorism situation in Georgia in 2021 remained quiet and stable. Georgia took further action to secure its border and arrested five Georgian citizens on ISIS -related terrorism charges in 2021. Updated counterterrorism financing legislation came into force in Georgia , and the country worked to update its National Counterterrorism Strategy and Action Plan. Far -right groups carried out violence against journalists and activists during a Tbilisi Pride event July 5. The groups also destroyed an opposition protest site at Parliament, attempted to storm Parliament, and attacked NGO offices. LGBTQI+ activists described feeling hunted , as the locations where they sought refuge were discovered by far -right groups. These events occurred after the prime minister called the planned Tbilisi Pride event \"inappropriate.\" Throughout the day, the Ministry of Internal Affairs failed to d eploy riot control measures. Despite the arrest and later conviction of 28 perpetrators, no group leaders or organizers of the violence have been held legally responsible. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorist incidents in 2021. Legislation , Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The Georgian Criminal Code criminalizes terrorism and acts that support terrorism , including terror financing, cyberterrorism, training, incitement, and recruitment into terrorist organizations, as well as foreign terrorist fighters. In 2021, Georgia developed its National Counterterrorism Strategy and Action Plan for 2022 - 26, as its previous counterterrorism strategy concluded. The new strategy and action plan included interagency input and was approved in Decembe r by Georgia's Interagency Standing Committee on Counterterrorism. Though the government included some NGOs in discussion of the strategy, a prominent civil society organization criticized the document for not adequately addressing key threats and challenge s, including major causes of radicalization in Georgia, and for not assessing the role of the state in the radicalization process. The government also approved a national strategy (2021 -30) and action plan (2021 - 23) for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) threat reduction. Georgia is generally capable of detecting, deterring, and responding to terrorism incidents. The State Security Service of Georgia (SSSG) has the mandate for terrorism -related incidents and investigations and works closely through its Counterterrorism Center with the Ministries of Internal Affairs, Justice, and Defense and the Prosecution Service of Georgia, among others. SSSG is generally well equipped and well trained , and the SSSG's Counterterrorism Unit continu es to receive regular training and equipment, including from international partners. Civil society, journalists, and the international community raised concerns in 2021 regarding the State Security Service's secret surveillance system and its lack of poli tical neutrality and weak oversight. Because Russia occupies the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgia does not control a portion of its internationally recognized land border with Russia and therefore must enforce security along admini strative boundary lines with its occupied territories. Georgia's Border Police and Coast Guard, both competent and organized, provide the initial response capability along Georgia's land and maritime borders, respectively, except along the occupied territ ories. In 2021, Georgia worked to enhance its land border and maritime security. The Border Police completed projects along Georgia's land border to increase patrolling, surveillance, and deterrence capabilities. Georgia finalized construction of one Land Border Segment along the border with T\u00fcrkiye , and one along the border with Azerbaijan. The Border Police enhanced detection capabilities with two additional mobile surveillance systems and increased the number of operational personnel along Georgia' s borders. Georgia created the Border Management and Coordination Division within the Ministry of Internal Affairs to improve intra -agency and interagency cooperation and risk management. To improve its national command and control, Georgia began laying fiber optic cable to connect its border security sector headquarters with regional and national control centers. Georgia also added a maintenance facility to service its video surveillance camera infrastructure. Further, Georgia equipped CBRN units in th e Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and SSSG with CBRN detection and decontamination equipment to respond to the risks and threats of WMD materials proliferation and their use. The United States provided Georgia's Coast Guard with new radar, communication, and surveillance systems to enhance Georgia's maritime domain awareness control capabilities. Resource constraints, including lack of funding for border scanning equipment, resulted in Georgia's reliance on donations of luggage and body scanners from China, as well as from the U nited States and Europe. In July, Georgia adopted a government decree approving the Rule on Transferring, Processing, Deleting, Obtaining, and Destroying API/PNR Record Data by Air Carriers. SSSG cooperated with air carriers, relevant agencies, and international partners to begin operation of API and PNR systems. Georgia participates in the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the World Customs Organization jointly run Container Control Program , and it has three task forces deployed to identify illegal cargo. Georgian border patrol agents check individuals, vehicles, and travel documents against databases, including INTERPOL. No Georgian citizens were identified as traveling to Syria or Iraq in 2021 for terrorist activities. Georgia did not repatriate any FTFs or family members from Syria or Iraq. In August, Georgia arrested five Georgian citizens in the Pankisi Gorge region on charges related to membership in ISIS and plans to travel to a terrorist camp in Syria. SSSG reported that one of the individuals had publicly stated he was ISIS's \"Emir of Georgia.\" Far-right, pro -Russia group Alt -Info and far -right networks associated with violent extremism including the Children's Rights Defenders Society and Georgian March organized and carried out violence against dozens of journalists and activists d uring the July 5 Tbilisi Pride event and a July 6 protest against the July 5 violence. No group leaders or organizers of the violence were held legally responsible. Alt -Info leaders subsequently registered a political party, the Conservative Movement, and opened offices across Georgia. Alt - Info/Conservative Movement leadership has called for and voiced support for violence to achieve their goals. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Georgia is a member of MONEYVAL and the CIFG. Georgia's FIU, the Financial Monitoring Service, is a member of the Egmont Group. On March 30, Georgia p assed updates to its Law on Facilitation of Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism, according to which amendments to the list of persons sanctioned by UN Security Council resolutions take direct effect in Georgia. Previously, legal acti on against such individuals required proceedings in Georgian court. Countering Violent Extremism: In 2021, Georgia continued efforts focused on minority integration, education, media access, youth, and cultural diversity. International and Regional C ooperation: Georgia is actively engaged on CT issues at international, regional, and bilateral levels. Georgia cooperates closely with NATO, the UN, the Council of Europe (CoE), the European Union, the OSCE, INTERPOL, and the Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan , and Moldova Organization for Democracy and Economic Development. In 2021, Georgia participated in UN, EU, U.S., and NATO trainings and conferences, including the Second UN High -Level Conference of Heads of Counter terrorism Agencies of Member States in J une. SSSG representatives participated in the CoE Steering Committee on Counterterrorism and various CoE CT working groups. GERMANY Overview: Germany continued its counterterrorism cooperation with the United States and the international community as a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS (and co - leader of the coalition's Stabilization Working Group) and the Global Counterterrorism Foru m and in multilateral CT operations in Africa and the Middle East. In 2021, Germany allocated more resources toward combating all forms of terrorism. German officials consider REMVE actors to be the greatest threat to domestic security. The COVID -19 pan demic was a driver for extremists with anti -government ideologies. Germany's domestic intelligence agency ( the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution) added , in April , a new category of extremism called \"delegitimization of the state.\" 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorist incidents reported in Germany in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The Act to Combat Right Wing Extremism and Hate Crimes entered into force on April 3. The Act amends several laws and obligates major social media companies to report suspected illegal content to authorities. Separate legislation that provides protections for politicians under threat and individuals disparaged for their national, racial, r eligious/ethnic origin, ideology, disability, or sexual orientation entered into force September 22. In July , the German P arliament passed legislation to strengthen the surveillance capabilities of the domestic intelligence service. The increasing use of encrypted communication poses challenges when conducting targeted surveillance. In March, Parliament passed a Foreign Intelligence Law that regulates and increases oversight of the German Foreign Intelligence Service. Federal and state law enforcement agencies both conduct CT investigations. They coordinate through the Joint Counterterrorism Center , consisting of 40 internal law enforcement, security and migration agencies to coordinate on work against Islamist -based te rrorism. For right , left, and nationalist -based extremism and terrorism, the Joint Extremism and Terrorism Prevention Center in Cologne is the site of interagency coordination. In 2021 , the Federal Prosecutor's Office opened about 420 new terrorism investigations. German auth orities collect API and use PNR analysis to combat serious crime and terrorism according to the relevant EU laws. German border management data systems, equipment, and infrastructure are highly developed. Germany repatriated eight ISIS -affiliated wom en and 23 children in October, arresting six of the women. Germany uses a comprehensive approach to deradicalization and reintegration under the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, which includes cooperation and services at state and local levels. Germany is not repatriating FTFs . In November , the Frankfurt Higher Regional court found an Iraqi national and former ISIS member, who was extradited to Germany, guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity for the enslavement of a Yazidi woman and her child, who died. He was sentenced to life in prison. His German wife was sentenced to 10 years for aiding and abetting the child's death. Significant law enforcement actions in 2021 included the following : In September, police arrested a 16 -year-old Syrian national for online contact with a known bomb specialist and on suspicion of plotting an attack on a synagogue during Yom Kippur. He is suspected to have been in contact with ISIS members in the Middle Ea st. No bombs were found, and the investigation was ongoing at year's end. In August, police arrested a 20 -year-old German Moroccan for trying to buy a pistol and a hand grenade on the dark web. Chemicals for building an explosive device were found in his possession , but no target was identified. In April , the trial against 12 alleged members/supporters of the \"right wing\" terrorist group Gruppe S began. The defendants, arrested in 2020, are accused of amassing weapons and developing plans to commit p olitical assassinations and attack migrants and Muslims. Germany is limited by its postwar security architecture with a strict organizational separation of law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Privacy and data protection laws place significant limits on the collection and retention of data. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Germany's Law on Associations gives the Interior Ministry authority to ban groups if their goals violate the criminal code. In May , the government banned Ansaar International e.V. and eight affiliates for using charitable donations to support terrorist organizations such as Jabhat al -Nusra, Hamas , and al- Shabab. Police conducted 70 search and seizure raids across 10 states. In May , the government banned and took measures against three associations suspected of fundraising for Hizballah, which was banned and designated a terrorist organization in 2020. Germany is also a member of the Defeat -ISIS Counter -ISIS Finance Group. Count ering Violent Extremism: The Strategy to Prevent Extremism and Promote Democracy (2016) guides the government's activities. Most programs are federally funded, led jointly by the Federal Interior and Family Ministries, and implemented through the states and NGOs. The federal Live Democracy! program is a cornerstone of the government's strategy. In 2021 , the budget for the pr ogram was increased to $166.3 million , to expand its programs on right -wing extremism and polarization of society. The Interior Ministry plans to use the amended Network Enforcement Act (2017) to address unlawful internet content. Augsburg, Berlin, Dresde n, D\u00fcsseldorf, and Halle are members of the Strong Cities Network. International and Regional Cooperation: Germany is a member of the GCTF and co - chair ed the GCTF's Capacity Building in the West Africa Region Working Group . Germany also cooperate d with other OSCE participating states in the fight against terrorism. Germany was a co-leader for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS's Stabilization Working Group, helping lead the effort in setting stabilization priorities in Iraq and Syria. I t was also a member of the Foreign Terrorist Fighter, Counter -ISIS Finance, and Communications Working Groups. GREECE Overview: The Greek government remained a highly collaborative CT partner in 2021. Consistent with its responsibilities as a particip ant in the Visa Waiver Program, Greece operationalized its Passenger Information Unit by presidential decree and has implemented screening of air passengers in accordance with international standards. Greece also passed legislation in accordance with an E U directive on combating money laundering by means of criminal law, as well as a law denying furloughs and preventing early release of convicted terrorists. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in Greece in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, Border Security: On July 9, the Greek Parliament passed legislation transposing, inter alia, EU Directive 2018/1673 of the European Parliament and of the Counci l of 23 October 2018 on combating money laundering by criminal law. Greece also passed legislation denying furloughs to those serving in minimum security prisons and early release for convicted terrorists. The creation of the Passenger Information Unit ( PIU) as the fifth department in the intelligence division of the Hellenic Police has been successful. The adoption of Automated Targeting System -Global (ATS -G), including access to U.S. - sourced terrorism screening data , constitutes a significant border sec urity upgrade. The PIU began receiving airline data from almost two dozen airlines in 2021 and expects to add an additional 12 airlines soon. Since Greece's national identification card remains vulnerable to alteration and photo substitution, Greek author ities moved forward in the process to provide citizens with biometric -enabled ID cards. Five consortia bid on the Ministry of Citizen Protection's $566 million tender for an integrated online system for security documents, including the new ID cards. The tender is stuck in a drawn -out process and legal challenges by some companies; however, it is expected that new ID cards will be issued in the next two years. Greek authorities carried out many arrests in 2021, including the following: A senior ISIS member was arrested in July in Greece, with Morocco's help. The suspect, a Moroccan national known as Abu Muhammad al -Fateh, had joined ISIS in Syria, after 2014, before later escaping to Greece. On July 21, Greek authorities arrested Christos Pappas , the deputy leader of the now - defunct neo -Nazi Golden Dawn party, in central Athens. He was arrested not for terrorism, but for criminal conspiracy. On October 4, Greek authorities arrested a suspected jihadist in Athens. The 34 -year- old Iraqi was charg ed with being a member of ISIS. On December 23, authorities in Athens arrested a 40 -year-old Iraqi man who was suspected of running a kind of \"travel agency\" for ISIS members looking to enter Greece and Europe. There also were several domestic terrorism a rrests, such as anarchists, including from the Revolutionary Self -Defense Force. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Greece is a member of FATF. Its FIU, the Anti - Money Laundering Counter terrorist Financing and Source of Funds Investigation Author ity, is a member of the Egmont Group. Countering Violent Extremism: In 2021, Greece continued to implement a law passed in 2020 to create a new division to prevent violent extremism, reporting directly to the Minister of Citizen Protection. Interna tional and Regional Cooperation: Greece is a member of various international bodies. Greece also acts as a regional leader and is a willing partner in sharing its counterterrorism experiences with its neighboring countries, particularly those in the Western Balkans. ITALY Overview: Italy collaborated closely with the United States and other partners in its international counterterrorism efforts in 2021. Domestically, Italy investigated and prosecuted terrorist suspects and regularly deported foreign nationals for terrorism -related security reasons. As a member of the Defeat -ISIS Coalition (and co -leader of the Counter - ISIS Finance Group), Italy was among the largest contributors of troops in Iraq and led the Defeat -ISIS Coalition's e fforts to train Iraqi police and security forces. The United States and Italy co -hosted a D efeat -ISIS Ministerial in Rome in June, which highlighted the growing threat of ISIS in Africa and the continued need for stabilization efforts and FTF repatriati ons to prevent the resurgence of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Italy remained one of the top troop contributors to NATO, the EU, the UN, and other bilateral and multilateral operations that promote global security, with a particular concentration on the wider M editerranean region. Italy hosts NATO's Strategic Direction -South HUB as a forum to connect NATO allies with partners and institutions in North Africa, the Middle East, Sub - Saharan Africa, and the Sahel to promote dialogue and stability. Italian authorit ies have identified several potential threats to the country, including terrorists from North Africa, returning foreign terrorist fighters, homegrown violent extremists, and fighters from the Western Balkans. Italian and U.S. authorities regularly share counterterrorism best practices under the auspices of the U.S. -Italy Counterterrorism Working Group, a component of the U.S. -Italy Strategic Dialogue. Italy is working to improve its screening of migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees in c onsultation with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in Italy in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There have been n o changes since 2020. Italian law enforcement has increased capacity to detect and deter terrorist activity, links, and associations within its borders. Authorities employ those capabilities to counter terrorist recruitment, radicalization to violence, and networking. Law enforcemen t agencies and intelligence services coordinate their efforts and meet on a regular basis to review terrorist threats and share information. The Italian government continued to make use of 2005 legislation facilitating the detention of terrorist suspects and expedited procedures for expelling noncitizens suspected of endangering national security. In 2021, Italy expelled 59 individuals suspected of posing a security threat. Police monitoring of jihadist media sites reveals that Italy remains a potential target of terror attacks, attributable in part to the presence of Vatican City, the city-state within Rome . Prominent arrests and expulsions included the following : On March 8, Bari police arrested a 36 -year-old Algerian man on charges of terrorism. Authorities offered evidence that the suspect provided forged identity documents to the perpetrators of the 2015 Paris \"Bataclan\" attack. On March 18, Italian authorities expelled a Tunisian migrant accused of telling friends he intended to car ry out terror attacks in Italy in the name of jihad. On April 21, Italian police arrested a 28 -year-old Albanian citizen accused of supplying weapons to the Tunisian terrorist who drove a truck into a crowd in Nice in 2016, killing 86 people. On July 5, It alian police arrested four Italian nationals in the southern city of Andria on suspicion of funding jihadists in other countries. Police said the four had sent more than $1 million through money transfers to \"foreign collectors \" in 49 countries, mostly go ing to ISIS affiliates. On November 17 , in Milan, Italian investigators arrested a 19 -year-old Italian - Kosovar woman and alleged ISIS militant. She was married to a Kosovar citizen closely linked to Kutjim Fejzulaiv, who allegedly killed four persons in a terrorist attack in Vienna in 2020. Police reportedly found training manuals, audio recordings, and videos praising ISIS in her apartment. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Italy is a member of FATF. Its FIU, the Financial Intelligence Unit of Italy, is a member of the Egmont Group. Italy remained a strong advocate of the UN Security Council sanctions regime against ISIS and al - Qa'ida. Italy is a co -lead for the Global Co alition to Defeat ISIS's Counter -ISIS Finance Group, w hich focuses on the disruption of ISIS financial networks. Countering Violent Extremism: No new legislation was passed in 2021 . The Penitentiary Administration's Central Investigative Center continued to carry out investigations and respond to cases of possible radicalization to violence in Italian jails and prisons. Italian authorities also increased monitoring and prevention ef forts to identify hostile \"lone actors\" online. Palermo is a member of the Strong Cities Network. International and Regional Cooperation: Italy continued its bilateral capacity building efforts in Libya, concentrat ing on coast guard cooperation and bo rder security measures. Italy also hosted and led EU Operation Irini, charged with implementing the UN arms embargo on Libya. The Italian military continued its training activities with local security forces in Niger to strengthen border security, counte r illicit trafficking, and combat threats to regional security. Italian forces also were in Mali as part of Task Force Takuba , which trains and assists the Malian Armed Forces in the fight against armed jihadist groups and as part of the EU Training Missi on in Mali. Italy made a substantial contribution to the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund, an inspired institution of the GCTF, and finalized a project to provide technical assistance on battlefield evidence to multiagency stakeholders in Burkina Faso. The project began in 2021 in cooperation with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Italy continued to support counterterrorism efforts in regional and multilateral organizations, including the following: the U N, NATO, the EU, the G -7, the Group of Twenty (G-20), the OSCE , the GCTF , the Council of Europe , and FATF. In addition to its leadership of the Counter -ISIS Finance Group and the newly formed Africa Focus Group, Italy is a member of the Foreign Terrorist Fighter, Stabilization, and Com munications Working Groups in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS . KOSOVO Overview: Kosovo continued its counterterrorism cooperation with the United States and the international community as a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. The government is drafting a new combined Strategy and Action Plan for Counterterrorism (CT) and Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) for 2023 -27. Although the CT/CVE Coordinator's Office was abolished in 2020, in April the government appointed Interior Minister Xhelal Svecla as the national CT/CVE coordinator. In July, Kosovo repatriated 11 citizens \u2014 six male foreign terrorist fighters, one adult female, and four children \u2014 from prisons and displaced persons camps in Syria. The adults were charged with terrorism offenses. This was Kosovo's second repatriation; it had repatriated more than 120 citi zens at the end of the reporting period. Numerous Kosovars remain in camps, prisons, or are unaccounted for on the battlefield in Syria. Short sentencing in Kosovo for terrorism offenses remains a challenge, as do the reintegration and rehabilitation of FTFs and family members. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Kosovo's legislative framework is adequate to prosecute individuals suspected of committing o r aiding terrorist activities or participating in foreign wars. Light sentencing, early or conditional release from prison, and a lack of organized post -incarceration supervision remain challenges. Kosovo maintained its commitment made at the White House in 2020 to enhance border security and screening to interdict terrorist travel. Kosovo has designated Hizballah in its entirety as a terrorist organization and is working toward passage of a Law on Targeted Financial Sanctions. Through participation in the State Department's Antiterrorism Assistance program, Kosovo Police (KP) received training in counterterrorism investigations and identification and seizure of digital evidence and have received associated equipment grants. U.S. mentor ship strengthened judges' and prosecutors' capacities and helped increase cooperation between KP and the Kosovo Correctional Service (KCS), specifically the Corrections Intelligence Unit (CIU). Kosovo 's policing and corrections systems have made strides i n understanding the recidivist threat among violent extremists and the risks of extremist \"contagion \" since the repatriation of 110 nationals in 2019 and 11 in July. There are no tailored interventions in Kosovo prisons for radicalized inmates \u2014 such a s cognitive behavioral therapy, mentoring, or structured dialogue tools \u2014 and no means to continue monitoring terrorism convicts after their release from prison. Kosovo lacks capacity and resources devoted to the long -term reintegration of returnees from Syria and deradicalization of homegrown extremists, and authorities are dependent on donor -driven programming. Significant law enforcement actions included the following : In January, Sadat Topojani was granted conditional release. Topojani was an IS IS recruiter who had been at the center of a KCS/CIU investigation into the distribution of extremist propaganda within the Kosovo prison system. In April , the Kosovo Appeals Court acquitted all defendants involved in the \"Hurricane\" case of terrorism -related charges, the final verdict in that case. The defendants' convictions on firearms offenses were affirmed, however, and they all remain incarcerated. In April , the Pristina Basic Court sentenced Nuredin Sulejmani to three years in prison for participating in ISIS during 2013 -14. U.S.-based assistance in obtaining evidence played an important role in securing this conviction. In September , the Supr eme Court of Kosovo upheld a five -and-a-half-year prison sentence for Visar Qukovci's participating in ISIS, while ordering a retrial on charges of child abuse. Qukovci, an FTF repatriated in 2019, had filmed videos in which he placed a suicide vest on hi s infant son. The Pristina Basic Court in June had sentenced the defendant to eight months in prison for child abuse charges , which were added to the previous sentence. In October, police arrested five individuals suspected of planning an attack and seize d an AK -47 weapon, ammunition, a handheld rocket -propelled grenade launcher and shells, explosive materials, electronics, and $71,207 in assorted currencies. This operation, the country's largest ever, benefited from U.S. assistance. In December , the Pristina Basic Court sentenced Kreshnik Podvorica to two years and six months in prison for incitement to commit terrorism. Podvorica was found guilty of publishing content glorifying terrorist acts in Syria and inciting terrorist acts, including vid eo publications of a terrorist act committed by his brother in Syria. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Kosovo's legal framework against money laundering and terrorist financing follows international standards. Its Financial Intelligence Unit is a member of the Egmont Group. One FTF repatriated in July was charged with terrorist financing. Countering Violent Extremism: Kosovo has shown limited progress in developing a new comprehensive CVE strategy. An interministerial working group is draf ting a new Strategy and Action Plan to merge CT and CVE into a unified strategy. Challenges include inadequate capacity and resources, a CVE approach overly focused on security , and limited access granted to NGOs to work directly with returnees. The KC S continued to implement a program, assisted by U.S. experts, to enhance management of terrorists in prison. This program involves collecting, analyzing, and sharing prison information among correctional service decisionmakers and other law enforcement officials and managing the rehabilitation and eventual reintegration of convicted terrorists. The Interior Ministry's Prevention and Reintegration Division, despite being chronically underresourced, continued programming to reintegrate individuals who had served time in prison on terrorism charges, FTF returnees, and their family members. Kosovo continues cooperative activities through the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund, through which Kosovo is strengthening the network of actors working on reintegrating and rehabilitating women and children who returned from conflict zones. Thirteen Kosovo municipalities are members of the Strong Cities Network. International and Regional Cooperation: Kosovo coordinates closely with Albania and North Macedonia to support CT capacity building and regional cooperation. THE NETHERLANDS Overview: The Netherlands continued to respond effectively to the global terrorist threat in border and transportation security, counterterrorist financing, CVE, and bilateral and multilateral CT cooperation. The national threat level remained \"significant\" ( level 3 of 5) throughout the reporting period, with jihadist -inspired individual attacks regarded as the most conceivable threat. The government is also tracking an elevated REMVE threat through participation in international accelerationist networks and incr eased intermingling with anti - government demonstrations against coronavirus measures. The Netherlands has a comprehensive national CT strategy and implements policies at the local level to counter all forms of terrorism through multidisciplinary interagen cy cooperation. The Netherlands participates in Defeat -ISIS working groups and is co -chair of its FTF Working Group with T\u00fcrkiye and Kuwait. The country has embedded liaisons at various operational command centers, deployed force protection units, and contributed military personnel and trainers in Iraq. The Netherlands is a member of the GCTF. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported incidents in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There were no significan t changes in law enforcement structures, capacity, international cooperation, or border security legislation in 2021. On November 9 , the government submitted a bill to the Dutch Parliament that would strengthen the legal basis for the National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security (NCTV) to process personal data for the purposes of protecting national security and combating terrorism. Significant law enforcement and judicial actions related to CT included the following : On February 17, there w as a stabbing of a prison guard by a Sunni extremist inmate Gokmen Tanis, while serving a life sentence for a 2019 attack. On April 6 , a 43-year-old Syrian man was arrested at an asylum seekers' center in Sint Annaparochie on suspicion of being involved in ISIS terrorist activities and other armed groups in Syria and Iraq. On April 17, an 18 -year-old man from Reuver was arrested on susp icion of preparing a terrorist attack. He allegedly participated in a Telegram chat group where instructions were shared on how to make explosives and a bomb vest. The Hague District Court in June sentenced a 33 -year-old woman to six years imprisonment f or her role as an administrator of an ISIS propaganda channel on Telegram. On September 23, nine individuals from Eindhoven were arrested on suspicion of preparing a terrorist offense, participating in a terrorist organization, and taking part in or facil itating jihadist training. The suspects allegedly discussed plans to attack Dutch politicians. The government approved the June 5 repatriation of a suspected ISIS sympathizer and her two children, along with a 12 -year-old whose mother had agreed to her repatriation on humanitarian grounds, in response to a local court ordering the defendant's appearance at trial. The NCTV assesses REMVE, or \"right -wing extremism\" as it is referred to in the Netherlands, as a threat to national security, particularly a mong young Dutch men who participate in international online accelerationist networks. REMVE actors in the Netherlands are loosely organized, lack central leadership, and are estimated at a few hundred individuals, mostly between the ages of 12 and 20. While there were no arrests of right -wing extremists for terrorist offenses inspired by right -wing extremist ideology, the government noted that arrests were made for other offenses, such as hate speech, incitement to commit criminal offenses, making threats, and possession of firearms. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: The Netherlands is a member of FATF and is one of the Cooperating and Supporting Nations of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force, a FATF -style regional body. The head of its FIU, the Financial Intelligence Unit -Netherlands, is the chair of the Egmont Group ; the FIU contributes to E uropol 's financial intelligence team. There were no changes to the Netherlands' membership in FATF and FATF -style regional bodies in 2021. The Dutch framework for countering terrorist financing applies to all EU -designated terrorist organizations and the UN Security Council ISIL and al -Qa'ida Sanctions Committee. As of December, the government's national terrorist watchlists include 145 individu als and two organizations whose assets were frozen. The Netherlands is also a member of the Counter -ISIS Finance Working Group in the Defeat -ISIS Coalition. Countering Violent Extremism: The Netherlands' 2016 -20 National Counterterrorism Strategy contains measures to strengthen communities, build resilience to terrorist radicalization, and prevent persons from becoming FTFs. Prevention is a key aspect of this strategy. The government us es a municipality -driven, multidisciplinary approach for prevention and develops tailored plans of action to intervene with individuals suspected of radicalization to violence. Similar programs also exist to rehabilitate former terrorists. Community po lice officers are the cornerstone of the local approach to prevention. Other stakeholders include local governments with the support of the Office of the National Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism, the public prosecutor's office, social workers, child protective services, educators, and community leaders. The Mi nistry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Education also play leading roles in countering foreign influence and funding for religious schools, NGOs, and other educational institutions. To counter terrorist messaging, local governments use outreach effo rts with community and religious leaders to amplify alternative narratives. The Hague, Rotterdam, and Utrecht are members of the Strong Cities Network. The Netherlands is a contributor to GCERF and the Strong Cities Network. International and Regional Cooperation: The Netherlands participates in the GCTF and is host to its Administrative Unit. The country is also on the governing board of the three GCTF -inspired institutions: the International Center of Excellence for Countering Violent Extremism ( Hedayah ), the International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law, and GCERF. The Netherlands is an active participant in E uropol 's European Counter Terrorism Centre and the Counter terrorism Group to improve cooperation and information exchange between and among European CT services. The nation continued to finance a wide variety of capacity building projects. Its Ministry of Foreign Affairs supports regional security coordinators at six embassies that are dedicated to capacity building to identify ter rorist radicalization. The Netherlands is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and co - leads the Foreign Terrorist Fighters' Working Group, which shares best practices and identifies key issues regarding FTFs in Iraq, Syria , Afghanistan, and Afri ca. In addition to this leadership, the Netherlands is a member of the Counter -ISIS Finance, Stabilization, and Communications Working Groups. NORTH MACEDONIA Overview: North Macedonia cooperated with U.S. counterterrorism efforts . With no terrorist attacks in 2021 and no reported departures to join ISIS, the main counterterrorism issue North Macedonia faced consisted of returned FTFs from Syria and Iraq, given these individuals' ability to establish violent extremist cells, plan attacks, and radicalize others to violence. The National Committee for Countering Violent Extremism and Countering Terrorism (NCCVECT) estimated that 143 citizens of North Macedonia (excluding children) in recent years have traveled or attempted to travel to Syria , to Iraq, or both, to join terrorist groups. Of these 143 adults (133 male, 10 female), 38 were killed, 79 returned, five are believed to remain in Syria, and two are in prison or a refugee camp. Another 16 (11 men and 5 women) were repatriated , and three FTFs were deported from other countries. Authorities assessed the terrorist threat level to be \"average high,\" or medium, as ISIS members and sympathizers maintained a presence in country. In July , the government repatriated four FTFs and 19 family members. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorist incidents reported in North Macedonia during 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: North Macedonia's legislative framework is adequate to prosecute individuals suspected of committing or aiding terrorist activities or participating in foreign wars. Low sentencing for terrorism -related offenses remains a challenge but improved , compared with previous years, and sentences are generally longer than in other Western Balkans countries. The U.S. Department of Justice provided mentoring and battlefield evidence training to case prosecutors and investigators. In July, authorities repatriated four adult male FTFs, five women, and 14 children from Syria. Two pleaded guilty and received sentences of three and five years for participation in a foreign army. In November , an appellate court doubled the three -year sentence. Separately, the appellate court lengthened prison sentences for three individuals arrested in 2020 for plotting a domestic terrorist attack, as all three defendants previously had been convicted of participation in a foreign army. During September and October, a court sentenced seven additional individuals connected to the 2020 plot. In March , an FTF who returned voluntarily received a five -year sentence. The Ministry of Interior's \"Terrorism and Violent Extremism Sector\" led law enforcement - related CT efforts. North Macedonia developed a new 2021 -25 National Strategy for Developing the Penitentiary System, which includes a component for deradicalizing and rehabilitating FTFs. The Department for Execution of Sanctions signed a n MOU with the United Kingdom in July and began implementation of a corrections intelligence unit focusing on identification and prevention of terrorism threats and criminal activity in prison facilities. North Macedonia continued its partnership with the U nited States on traveler screening tools and continues to take steps to enhance border security and screening efforts to include systematic use of Advanced Passenger Information and Passenger Name Record data in line with international standards. However, there was little progress with the Passenger Information Unit. The unit is still nonoperational because of legal amendments pending in Parliament. In December, authorities met with Watchlisting Assistance and Support Program experts from the U.S. Depart ment of State to discuss gaps and weaknesses in watchlisting efforts. North Macedonian authorities cooperated with INTERPOL, E uropol , the European CT Centre, and the FBI. U.S. support for CT training and mentorship has largely resumed after pandemic -related delays. Countering the Financing of Terrorism : The country's legal framework follows international standards. North Macedonia is a member of MONEYVAL, a Financial Action Task Force (FATF) -style regional body. Its Financial Intelligence Unit, th e Financial Intelligence Office (FIO), is a member of the Egmont Group. The government drafted a new law on Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing to implement the provisions of Directive V (2018/843) and harmonize it with EU legislation. The new draft law incorporates articles aimed at overcoming risks identified in the 2020 National Risk Assessment on terrorism financing of non -profit organizations and implements FATF recommendations. In August , the government adopted a new National Str ategy for Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (2021 -24). In 2021 , the FIO received five reports for suspicion of terrorist financing from banks, and it submitted 11 total reports on suspicion of terrorist financing to competent authorities for processing. DOJ/OPDAT resident legal advis ers trained prosecutors and invest igators on terrorist financing. Countering Violent Extremism : The NCCVECT continued awareness -raising activities around the national CVE strategy and action plan. In August , the government appointed a new National Coordinator and CT and CVE deputies and expanded the committee's staff. The NCCVECT established two additional multistakeholder Community Action Teams now operational in six municipalities and focused on preventing violent extremism. FTF repatriations were conducted in accordance with international law and the National Plan for the Reintegration, Resocialization , and Rehabilitation of Returnees From Foreign Armies. The government, with the support of the International Organization for Migration, in March drafted and adopted standard o perating procedures for treatment protocols of FTFs and their family members. Social workers and mental health practitioners received training on psychosocial support for individuals who have returned from conflict zones. The United States supported t he NCCVECT in organizing an interfaith dialogue, which included the country's two largest religious communities, the Macedonian Orthodox Church and the Islamic Religious Community. The U.S. -funded Women Without Borders' MotherSchools program continued tea ching mothers in identified municipalities how to recognize and respond to early warning signs of radicalization and extremism in their children and their communities. Eight municipalities in North Macedonia are members of the Strong Cities Network. North Macedonia is also a partner country of the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund (GCERF). International and Regional Cooperation: North Macedonia continued its close cooperation with other Western Balkan countries on CT and CVE issues. North Macedonia participated in the implementation of projects in the Western Balkans funded by GCERF, Hedayah , the Strong Cities Network, Integrativ e Internal Security Governance, and others. Regionally, authorities held working meetings with the equivalent coordination bodies of Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The government implemented capacity building projects supported by the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, and others. These efforts will help North Macedonia prepare for its 2023 OSCE chairpersonship. NORWAY Overview: Norway's Police Security Service's annual threat assessment stated that the terror threat level remains moderate with an \"even chance\" \u2014 the third on its five -tier threat scale \u2014 that right -wing or Islamist extremists will carry out an attack in 2022. Lone-actor attacks continue to be the greatest threat, driven by continued online recruitment and radicalization to violence. Norway's law enforcement capacity for proactively detecting, deterring, and preventing acts of terrorism in its territory is strong , despite underfunding in some areas. Norway is postured to prevent acts of terrorism, and its bilateral counterterrorism cooperation with the U.S. government is strong. Operational cooperation is high. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorist incidents reported in Norway. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There were no legislative changes related to counterterrorism in Norway in 2021. Norway issued new passports with enhanced security features in 2020. To prevent misuse, Norwegian passports are immediately canceled when they are reported lost or stolen. The adjudication process for new passports includes automatic biometric comparisons and more training for adjudicators at 79 passport and ID offices nationwide , including at Oslo Gardermoen Airport. Biometric emergency passports issued at Gardermoen are valid for one exit and one entry to Norway and must be surrendered on the traveler's return. Older passports will be phased out as they reach the end of their 10-year validity for adults, and sooner for children under 16. A 16 -year-old Syrian boy was found guilty of planning an act of terrorism on June 29. A Norwegian -Pakistani woman is appealing her three -year prison sentence handed down in May for tr aveling to Syria to be with her husband, who was then a member of the al -Nusra Front and later a member of ISIS. Authorities arrested five persons connected to right -wing anti -government extremism in an August investigation into a Norwegian citizen for f irearms violations. The inquiry led to an investigation of a related individual for demonstrated interest in \"accelerationism\" and ISIS propaganda videos. Norw egian and U.S. law enforcement counterparts coordinated well on an investigation into the outla w motorcycle gang Chieftains' activities in the U nited States and Norway. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: There have been n o changes since 2020. Norway is a member of the Defeat -ISIS Counter -ISIS Finance Group , and its FIU is a member of FATF and the Egmont Group . Countering Violent Extremism: The government announced a new counterterrorism strategy focused on 1) improving technology in the intelligence services ; 2) increasing communication with identified targets of terror ; 3) expandi ng public -private and agency -to- agency cooperation to mitigate and respond to terror attacks ; and 4) strengthening reintegration efforts for pe rsons who have been radicalized or convicted for terrorism - related acts. The government continues to implement its Action Plan Against Radicalization and Violent Extremism. The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) provided $1.1 million in grants for local community programs countering radicalization and violent extremism. The grants went to a variety of municipal programs such as training mentors, a summer work program for youth, and strengthening cross -cultural identity youth programs. Norway repatriated a Norwegian orphan from the Al -Hol camp in Syria, the third repatriation from ISIS refugee camps in Syria to Norway. At least four of the 11 Norwegian women known to have traveled from Norway to Syria to join ISIS remain in refugee camp s in Syria. Norwegian authorities presume five are dead. The Police Security Service ( PST) charged the remaining women with participating in a terrorist organization in absentia. The foreign minister said that as a general rule , Norway does not assist c itizens who participated in a terrorist organization overseas, in response to a petition from two of the women for help repatriating to Norway. The PST estimates that 20 out of at least 140 Norwegian -affiliated individuals who traveled to Syria and Iraq t o fight on behalf of ISIS remain in those countries. The Supreme Court is reviewing the appeal of a 25 -year-old man who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for participating in ISIS online forums and encouraging terrorist acts in England and Denmark. He is the first individual in Norway to be convicted for acts committed exclusively online. Kristiansand and Oslo are members of the Strong Cities Network. Norway is a donor for the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund (GCERF) and the Strong C ities Network. International and Regional Cooperation: Norway chaired the UNSC D emocratic People 's Republic of North Korea Sanctions Committee, the ISI S and al-Qa'ida Sanctions Committee, and the Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, and was penholder for Afghanistan and Syria issues. Norway s upported the UN Secretary General's Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism and p rovided resource support to UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali. In addition to is support t o GCERF, Norway s upported INTERPOL's capacity building programs on border security and rule of law in North Africa and the Sahel. And i n addition to its membership in the Counter -ISIS Finance Group, Norway is a member of the Foreign Terrorist Fighters, Stabilization, and Communications Working Groups in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. The country contributed $1.2 million to the UN Office of Counterterrorism for the 2018 -21 period and s upported Norwegian Special Forces in the NATO -led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan. Norway also provided an annual $7.1 million to Afghan security forces and provided up to 70 personnel in coun seling and force protection duties through Operation Inherent Resolve and 10 in the NATO Mission Iraq. Norway c o-led with the United States on the Global Counterterrorism Forum \"Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremism\" REMVE Toolkit Initiative and actively participated in the Awareness Network; OSCE; the Christchurch Call to Action; and the Global Counterterrorism Forum Working Group on Capacity Building in East Africa. State Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Henrik Thune spoke at the launch of the International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law Criminal Justice Practitioner's Guide for Addressing Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremism. Kristiansand and Os lo are members of the Strong Cities Network (SCN). During an SCN visit to Kristiansand, the municipality of Mombasa, Kenya, signed an MOU that outlines plans for the two cities to conduct practitioner exchanges and trainings, youth exchanges, civil societ y mobilization, and crime and violence prevention programming to prevent violent extremism. Ten Norwegian cities are part of the Nordic Safe Cities Network. RUSSIA Overview: The Russian Federation continued to prioritize counterterrorism efforts in 2021, primarily focusing on perceived domestic terrorist groups. Russia has used counterterrorism and \"extremism\" as pretexts to suppress political opposition and the exercise of human rights, or for other objectives in both do mestic and foreign policy. Russia remained concerned about violent extremist Islamic groups, including those with ideological ties to ISIS and al -Qa'ida. Following the Taliban takeover of Kabul, Russia has looked to build inroads with the Taliban, both t o establish influential regional footholds and out of concern that terrorism would spill over into Central Asia and the broader former Soviet space. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported incidents in Russia in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Under the coordination of the National Antiterrorism Committee, the Federal Security Service (the FSB) \u2014 with aid from the Ministry of Internal Affairs (the MVD) and Rosgvardiya (the National Guard of Rus sia), when appropriate \u2014 perform counterterrorism functions. Russia has continued to use its counterterrorism and anti -extremism legislation as a tool to stifle political opposition, independent media, and certain religious organizations, including Jehova h's Witnesses, to criminalize the exercise of freedoms of religion or belief, expression, and association. In 2021, Russia continued to use terrorism as a pretext to stifle internal dissent. The State Duma (Parliament) adopted three bills meant to silenc e individuals who provide any dissent toward the government and prevent them from participating in public life. These bills target Russians who support civil society and religious organizations that have been declared \"extremist\" or \"terrorist\" under the law that designates organizations as \"undesirable.\" Those bills are Adopted on June 4, Bill No.1165649 -7 bans leaders, staff, and supporters of organizations labeled as \"extremist\" from running for parliamentary elections. The bill gives Russian authori ties the power to label any political group or entity as \"extremist.\" Adopted on June 9, Bill No.1165650 -7 amends the law on \"undesirable\" organizations and prohibits Russian citizens from participating in activities of these organizations. It also impose s stricter measures on finances for organizations that operate with Russian bank accounts and those that receive money from persons who have been labeled as foreign agents. Adopted on July 1, Bill No.1165661 -7 simplifies the process for charging and convic ting those who have been designated as affiliates of \"undesirable\" organizations. Russian President Vladimir Putin reported that Russia's security agencies saw a decline in terrorist threats and claimed that Russia had prevented 32 terrorist attacks over an 11 -month span in 2021. Russia's FSB Director General Alexander Bortnikov reported in December that terrorist attacks had been averted this year as a result of using \"forceful and preventive measures,\" according to Russian state news agency TASS. Additionally, Russian media has claimed that Russia has stopped 62 clandestine cells of international terrorist groups and prevented 926 people involved in terrorist activities from entering Russia. According to Russian media, the government conducted at least 327 regional counterterrorism exercises and more than 323,000 preventive efforts designed to promote intolerance to terrorism. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: In 2021, Russia was a member of FATF, MONEYVAL, and the Eurasian Group on Combatin g Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (EAG). Its FIU, the Federal Financial Monitoring Service (Rosfinmonitoring), is a member of the Egmont Group. In addition, according to the federal law \"On the Central Bank of Russia (CBR),\" the CBR has the a uthority to monitor activities of Russian financial organizations to assess their compliance with provision of the federal law \"On the Prevention of Criminal Proceeds Legalization and Terrorist Financing.\" The CBR monitors the implementation of AML/CFT la ws and imposes liability for violations committed by banking institutions. Criminal cases involving money laundering are investigated by the MVD, the Russian Investigative Committee, and/or the FSB. Countering Violent Extremism: According to NGO reports , Russian government authorities, including the MVD 's Center for Countering Extremism and the FSB, continue to misuse the country's expansive definition of extremism to curtail freedoms of expression, religion or belief, peaceful assembly, and association. Under new legal amendments, the Russian government has continued to add notable entities, such as Bard College in Annandale, New York, to the \"undesirable\" organizations list allegedly owing to the \"program's threat to order and security.\" International and Regional Cooperation: Russia is a member of the Global Counterterrorism Forum and the Collective Security Treaty Organization in addition to being an active participant in several multilateral organizations, including the OSCE, the Council of Europe, the UN, the Eurasian Economic Community, the East Asia Summit, the ASEAN Regional Forum, and APEC. Following the Taliban takeover of Kabul, Russia and Tajikistan have strengthened their military alliance and held joint exercises at the Tajikistan -Afghanistan border. These exercises were intended to strengthen Tajik -Russian relations and to fortify border security. SERBIA Overview: With no terrorist attacks in 2021 and low levels of ISIS recruitment, the main terrorism concerns in Serbia remained the movement of money and weapons through the region, the need to repatriate FTFs and their family members from Syria, and terrorist self - radicalization through racially or ethnically motivated ideologies often related to nationalism. Serbia continued efforts to counter terrorism and cooperate with the United States and international partners. 2021Terrorist Incidents: There were no r eported terrorist incidents in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Serbia's Ministry of Interior has a Counter terrorism Service ( the CT Service), which includes a Department for Preventing and Combating Extremism. Serbia's Criminal Code criminalizes terrorism -related offenses , including international terrorism, incitement, recruitment, using a deadly device, destruction and damage to a nuclear facility, terrorist financing, and terrorist association. Amendments to the Criminal Code in 2019 introduced life imprisonment for acts of terrorism resulting in death and extended the application of terrorist financing to other crimes. The code also outlaws unauthorized participation in a foreign war or armed conflict, prescribing incarcerati on from six months to 10 years for such activities. Serbia has sentenced individuals for participating in terrorist -related activities in Syria and for participating in the Russia -Ukraine conflict in eastern Ukraine. The CT Service reported that of the 1 0 Serbian FTFs who have returned to Europe from Syria or Iraq, four returned to Serbia. Serbia prosecuted seven such FTFs (some in absentia ), for a total of 69 years of sentencing, according to the CT Service. According to some NGOs and investigative outlets, prosecutors dealing with such cases reportedly apply different standards, with returnees from Syria facing up to 11 -year sentences under terrorism -related offenses and returnees from Ukraine receiving suspended sentences for particip ation in a foreign armed conflict. The CT Service responded that the Criminal Code allows only those convicted of fighting with UN -designated terrorist groups, such as ISIS, may be prosecuted for terrorism -related offenses. Serbians fighting with pro -Russ ia groups in Ukraine \u2014 not designated as terrorist groups by the UN \u2014 were prosecuted for participation in a foreign armed conflict, according to the CT Service. Serbia lacks legislation that more broadly covers conduct related to receiving terrorist trai ning, funding terrorist organizations, and terrorist recruitment activities. Although UNSCR 2396 calls on member states to develop systems to screen PNR data, currently API and PNR screening programs are not in place in Serbia, although data Serbian airlines are required to transmit to the United States and other governments is collected and handled by third -party data vendors . Serbia in 2020 pledged, as part of the Washington Commitments, to implement information sharing agreements with the United States and to strengthen screening measures. Serbia is integrating with the European Common Aviation Area and cooperates with international partners to enhance capacities in accordance with UNSCR 2309. According to NGOs there were at least 26 family members of Serbian FTFs in Syria, while the CT Service reported that 27 Serbian national adults are currently in Syria, among whom are family members of FTFs . There were no indications that Serbia repatriated any of these individuals. Some NGOs an d local communities claimed Serbia was unwilling to repatriate its nationals from Syria. International organizations reported that Serbia was establishing local reintegration teams and drafting bylaws to eventually receive repatriated citizens. In the 2 020 Washington Commitments, Serbia pledged to designate Hizballah in its entirety as a terrorist organization and implement measures to restrict its operations and financial activities in Serbian jurisdictions. Serbia had not made this designation nor imp lemented these measures by the end of the reporting period , as the government reported that it follows UN designations of terrorism organizations when making such decisions . There was no change to the way that the courts address terrorism in 2021. Curre nt law stipulates that the Belgrade Higher Court's Special Department for Organized Crime hears terrorism -related offenses, and the Organized Crime Prosecutor's Office prosecutes them. The Belgrade Appellate Court's Special Department for Organized Crime hears appeals. Serbia's law enforcement capabilities need improvement but are progressing. The Criminal Police Directorate's Service for Combating Terrorism and Extremism (TES) works on terrorism detection, deterrence, and prevention. Serbia's Operatio nal Working Group consists of TES, the Security Intelligence Agency (BIA), and the Prosecutor's Office. Soft targets are required to have terrorism contingency plans, with TES officers providing consultation and oversight. The Interior Ministry's Special Anti-Terrorist Unit (SAJ) provides tactical response to terrorist incidents. The Serbian Border Police's System to Check Persons and Vehicles (SZPLIV) screens passengers and vehicles at all border crossings and other ports of entry. SZPLIV verifies t he validity of travel documents through basic indicative security elements, collects biographic and biometric data, checks visa status, searches national and international databases, and stores the information. However, data transmission to the central sy stem can take days. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Serbia is a member of MONEYVAL, a FATF - style regional body, and has observer status in the EAG. Its FIU, the Administration for the Prevention of Money Laundering (APML), is a member of the Egmont Group. Serbia is in negotiations with the EU under Chap ter 4 of the EU Acquis ( free movement of capital), which requires alignment with international standards and improved administrative AML and CFT capacity. In September , the APML, with U.S. support, finalized its National Risk Assessment for Money Launderi ng, Financing of Terrorism, and Proliferation, which rated the risk of terrorism financing as \"medium to low,\" an improvement over its last assessment. The 2020 -24 National Strategy for Prevention of Money Laundering, Financing of Terrorism, and Prolifera tion was finalized and adopted in 2020. Its second action plan, for 2022 -24, will be finalized in 2022. Countering Violent Extremism: Serbia implemented its National Strategy for the Prevention and Countering of Terrorism for the Period 2017 -21 and a ccompanying Action Plan, which seeks to identify factors leading to radicalization, to enhance citizens' security, and to intercept threats from social media activities. Serbia reported it will develop a new strategy in 2022. The Serbian intergovernmenta l CT working group meets regularly. The municipalities of Bujanovac, Novi Pazar, Presevo, and Tutin are members of the Strong Cities Network. The CT Service reported that Serbia established four local teams made up of police, psychologists, and social wo rkers in the cities of Belgrade, Novi Pazar, Smederevo, and Vranje that would support efforts for reintegration and social support for extremist individuals. These teams would fall under the National Coordinator for Counter terrorism, but the CT Service reported they would operate independently, at the community level, in counter -extremism and reintegration efforts. International and Regional Cooperation: Serbia is engaged in some regional and international cooperation on CT issues. The Mini stry of Interior and BIA cooperate with INTERPOL and E uropol on CT activities, including watchlists. A participant in NATO's Partnership for Peace, Serbia routinely participates in international law enforcement training. In 2021, SAJ participated in two U.S. Special Operations Command training events for response to terrorist -related incidents. Serbia cooperated with UNODC for arms control and border security programs that bolstered regional CT efforts. The OSCE supported seminars and other events to prevent violent extremism and terrorist recruitment. Serbia has well -developed bilateral border security cooperation programs with Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. Serbia has a tri-border partnership with Bosnia and Herzegovina and with Croatia. Serbian law enforcement agencies routinely engage with counterparts in Albania, North Macedonia, and Montenegro. SPAIN Overview: Spain continued to respond effectively to the global terrorism threat in border and transportation security, countering terrorism financing, and countering violent extremism through bilateral and multilateral cooperation. Spain remained on \"high\" national alert for terrorism throughout 2021 for the seventh year in a row. Spanish authorities continued to arrest individuals suspected of planning terror attacks, facilitating terrorist financing, and engaging in ISIS - and al -Qa'ida -related recruitment and radicalization, both online and in their communities. During the year, Spanish counterterrorism cooperation wit h the United States was excellent. In 2021, Spain served as co -facilitator of the UN Global Counterterrorism Strategy Review. Spain maintained its contribution to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, with about 150 personnel deployed to Iraq throughout t he year in military and police training missions. Spain continued to exercise leadership in regional and global CT fora, including the GCTF and the 5+5 Defense Initiative. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: On September 14 , a Moroccan national drove a vehicle into a crowd of people outside a restaurant, killing one bystander and injuring two others, before stabbing himself to death. Notes left by the perpetrator suggesting premeditation caused the Guardia Civil to investigate the crash as a potential terroris t incident. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security Legislation: No changes since 2020. During 2021 , the government continued to implement the 2020 law regarding the collection and analysis of API/PNR. The Spanish government continued to i mplement its National Strategy Against Terrorism. The Ministry of Interior, through its Intelligence Center for Counterterrorism and Organized Crime (CITCO), with contributions from the Ministries of Defense, Foreign Affairs, and Justice, developed the document to align with the four pillars of Counter terrorism Strategies of the EU and the UN: Prevent, Protect, Pursue, and Prepare the response. The strategy includes measures to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks against soft targets, such as hotels, stadiums, tourist resorts, and cultural sites, i n line with UNSCR 2341 on protecting critical infrastructure from terrorist attacks. The Spanish criminal code punishes any act of \"collaboration with the activities or purposes of a terrorist organization,\" including promoting terrorism on social media, self- radicalization on the internet, training remotely, operating without clear affiliation, and traveling in support of nonstate terrorist actors. Spanish authorities reported they had undertaken 22 counterterrorist operations and detained 45 suspects f or terrorism -related charges during the year. Significant law enforcement actions related to CT included the following : On January 10, Spanish National Police (SNP) arrested three individuals on terrorist charges for allegedly planning an imminent ter rorist attack in Spain or another European country. On March 4 , the government destroyed 1,377 weapons that had been under judicial control in relation to trials completed during 1975 -2005 in prosecution of domestic terror groups. On April 29 , the SNP arre sted three suspected terrorists who used social networks to encourage terrorist and violent actions against French individuals and institutions. The SNP arrested, on terrorism charges, an Algerian national affiliated with a North African criminal smuggling operation on July 31 on Mallorca. Officials suspect the smuggling operation of facilitating entry for suspected Algerian terrorists into Spain and transporting suspected terrorists between Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia. On September 9 , the SNP ide ntified a prisoner at Penitential Center Daroca , in Zaragoza , with ties to ISIS and launched an intervention. Authorities said the inmate \"devoted significant time\" to radicalizing fellow prisoners and made credible threats of violence against Spanish government entities. On October 10 and 11, SNP arrested five Algerian nationals and charged one with indoctrination, terrorism, and possession of a deadly weapon, and three others with membership in a terrorist group. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: There have been no legislative or significant policy changes since 2020. On March 23 , the SNP arrested the president of the Islamic Commission of Spain Mohamad Aiman Adlbi, along with two other individuals , as part of an antiterrorism financing operation. The 74 -year-old Adlbi was provisionally released because of health issues while the investigation continues. Spain is also a member of the Defeat -ISIS Counter -ISIS Finance Group. Countering Violent Extremism: Spain continued implementation of its national CVE plan, developed in 2015, adjusted annually, and led by CITCO. The plan identifies the potential for terrorist radicalization and recruitment down to the census district level , using an algorithm based on socioeconomic factors , and seeks to build partnersh ips at the local level between civil society leaders from vulnerable communities and representatives of law enforcement and other public services. On November 29 , the union of incarcerated Basque separatist terrorists ( Euskal Preso Politikoen Kolektiboa , or EPPK) announced it would no longer support public events celebrating the release of Basque Fatherland and Liberty (Euzkadi ta Askatasuna , or ETA ) members who had been convicted of violent terrorist acts. The welcome -home ceremonies, known as ongi etorr i, are seen by many as glorification of violence and an effort to undermine rule of law. Despite the November 29 statement, the ongi etorri continued to take place regularly when ETA members were released from prison. International and Regional Cooperat ion: In 2021, Spain served as co -facilitator of the UN Global Counterterrorism Strategy Review. Spain is a founding member of the GCTF and supports CT initiatives in the UN, the Council of Europe, NATO, and the OSCE. In addition to its membership in the Counter -ISIS Finance Group, Spain is a member of the Foreign Terrorist Fighter, Stabilization, and Communications Working Groups. Spain is a donor nation to the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund and maintained forces throug hout 2021 in EU training missions in Mali and Somalia. Spain continues to support the 5+5 Defense Initiative bringing together European (France, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Spain) and North African (Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia) countries to b uild capacity on CT, maritime and aviation security, and disaster management. The Spanish cities of Fuenlabrada and M \u00e1laga are both members of the Strong Cities Network. SWEDEN Overview: The National Center for Terrorist Threat Assessment (NCT) assessed that violent right -wing extremism and violent Islamist extremism posed the main terrorist threats to Sweden in 2021. Current terrorist threats from the left -wing radical environment are currently assessed to be close to nonexistent. A small number of individuals in these extremist environments could possibly develop the intent and capability to carry out a terrorist attack in Sweden. NCT also noted that online radicalization to violence and attacks by lone actors had gradually become more prominent. The Swedish Security Service reported that violent right -wing extremism had coordinating bodies at the national level, unlike violent Islamist extremism, which lacked the same level of cohesive leadership and organizational structure . However, violent Islamist extremists received the most funding from abroad and had the capability to generate income. Some violent extremist organizations increasingly use digital platfo rms rather than meeting in person. The Swedish Security Service regularly receives information on firearms and explosives with links to violent right -wing or left -wing extremism. At the end of 2021 , the national alert level remained at Level 3 (elevated threat, no evidence of planning) on a scale of 5 (attack imminent, evidence of planning). The government continued efforts to strengthen its counterterrorism framework. Laws on data retention and signals intelligence improved access to information to fig ht terrorism in 2021. The new legislation made it easier for the government agencies that make up the National Center for Terrorist Threat Assessment to exchange data. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorist incidents reported in Sweden in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: In 2021 , the government proposed a new Terrorism Offenses Act replacing the three current laws relating to terrorism. All crimes should be tried as terrorist crimes if they have the capa city to hurt a country or an international organization and are carried out with the intent of terrorism. The Act proposes that prison sentences for most crimes relating to terrorism should be raised and Swedish courts should be able to carry out sentence s, no matter who has committed the crime or where the crime has been committed. The changes will come into force at midyear of 2022. Sweden repatriated at least nine female FTFs and their approximately 14 children who had previously been in Syrian Democratic Forces -run detention camps in Syria. The Security Service estimated that around 300 Swedish citizens traveled to join ISIS and around 150 returned during the last few years. One repatriated female foreign terrorist fighter was convicted in District Court in Lund and sentenced to three years in prison for child endangerment after bringing her infant child into the Syrian warzone, where she joined ISIS, and others were being i nvestigated for war crimes. Swedish authorities collaborated closely with the FBI in their efforts to build criminal cases against the Swedish foreign terrorist fighters. The Swedish Center for CVE organized a network of nine agencies and organizations t o support the rehabilitation and integration of the returnees. Sweden is party to the EU's identity verification and border management tools, such as the Schengen Information System and the Visa Information System. Sweden collects and uses API, and some PNR, and exchanges information with other member states on irregular migration and border control. Sweden used the \"serious threat to public policy or internal security\" justification permitted under the Schengen Border Code to unilaterally prolong the temporary border controls first introduced in 2015 until midyear of 2022. The Nordic Resistance Movement (NRM) and Nordic Strength are the two major neo-Nazi movements in the Nordic countries. The two groups have around 200 active members in Sweden combined. NRM conducted several acts of harassment and vandalism during 2021. The Swedish Jewish community was one of the most targeted groups. The movements also integrated into the anti -vaccine movement. In January, two members of the \"Eco -Fascist and Right -Wing Extremist\" group \"The Green Brigade\" were convicted in District Court in Nacka on charges related to the arson of a mink farm in Southern Sweden in 2019. Because of their age at the t ime of the crime in Sweden (17 and 18 years old), the two men received no jail time. Court documents showed the men were also discussing attacks against abortion centers and judges among other plots. Swedish authorities and Luxembourg authorities collabo rated closely with the FBI throughout the investigation of The Green Brigade. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Sweden is a member of FATF. Its FIU, the National Financial Intelligence Service, is a member of the Egmont Group. There have been no si gnificant changes to legislation or policy since 2020. Countering Violent Extremism: The Swedish Center for Preventing Violent Extremism promotes and coordinates preventive efforts at the national, regional, and local level. The Center supports municipalities, government agencies, and others in preventing violent extremism. The Security Service, together with other authorities, tried to close five schools that had been under the influence of leading figures in the violent Islamist environment and had been suspected of receiving funds from organizations with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. The decision was overruled after the schools' own ers appealed, and a final decision is pending. Malm \u00f6 and Stockholm are members of the Strong Cities Network. International and Regional Cooperation: Sweden is a member of the EU and supports CT efforts in regional and multilateral organizations, includi ng the European Commission's Radicalization Awareness Network, the EU -9 (focusing on FTFs), the Counter terrorism Group, the Police Working Group on Terrorism, Europol, and the Global Coalition's Stabilization Working Group. Sweden engaged in the followin g efforts to combat terrorism internationally: Organiz ing the 2021 OSCE -wide Counterterrorism Conference Funding international CT capacity building projects through development assistance Funding to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime's Terrorism Prevention Branch Funding to the OSCE Contributing 220 troops (a rifle company and a support unit) to MINUSMA Joining the UN Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da'esh /ISIL Extending Sweden's regional crisis strategy for Sy ria ($425 million for 2016 -23) that includes resilience support for groups affected by ISIS's progress T\u00dcRKIYE Overview: T\u00fcrkiye experienced a significant decrease in terrorist incidents within its borders in 2021, compared with prior years. However, it has expanded its counterterrorism operations in Iraq and Syria and provided counterterrorism support to Somalia. Media reported that Turkish airstrikes against the Kurdistan Workers' Party ( PKK ) in northern Iraq resulted in civilian casualties, including children. T\u00fcrkiye also has continued its active counterterrorism cooperation with the international community as a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, the Global Counterterrorism Forum, and the Committee of Experts on Terrorism of the Council of Europe. Active as a co -chair of the Defeat -ISIS Coalition's FTF Working Group, T\u00fcrkiye also provided access to its airspace an d facilities for coalition counterterrorism operations in Iraq and Syria. T\u00fcrkiye remains a transit point for FTFs departing Syria and Iraq. Domestically, T\u00fcrkiye confronts terrorist organizations, including the PKK, ISIS, and the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP -C), all active both inside the country and along its borders. The nation also views the Syrian Democratic Forces, a U.S. partner in the counter -ISIS campaign, as a branch of the PKK terrorist group, and this remained a signifi cant point of friction with the United States. Notably, T\u00fcrkiye does not consider Hamas a terrorist organization; the U.S. -designated group maintains offices in Istanbul, and Hamas' political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, has met with Turkish President Erdogan. In the aftermath of the 2016 coup attempt, the Government of T\u00fcrkiye labeled the movement of self -exiled cleric and political figure Fethullah Gulen as the Fethullah Terrorist Organization (\"FETO\"). FETO (the Gulen movement) is not a designated terrori st organization in the United States. T\u00fcrkiye continues to detain and arrest Turkish citizens \u2014 including locally employed staff at the U.S. Mission to T\u00fcrkiye \u2014 and foreign citizens residing in T\u00fcrkiye for alleged Gulen or terrorism -related links, often based on scant evidence and minimal due process. The Government of T\u00fcrkiye also continued to dismiss military, security, and civil servants from public office in 2021. Since the failed coup, the Government of T\u00fcrkiye has conducted 135,916 Gulen -related o perations, arrested 312,121 citizens, dismissed or suspended more than 125,000 civil servants from public office, and closed more than 1,500 NGOs for alleged Gulen movement links. Politically motivated detentions and arrests of individuals \u2014 including jou rnalists, human rights activists, lawyers, and politicians accused of supporting or aiding either the PKK or the Gulen movement \u2014 under antiterror and other laws continued in 2021. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: Terrorist incidents included the following: In February, the PKK killed 13 Turkish soldiers and police officers (originally kidnapped in T\u00fcrkiye ) during a botched hostage rescue attempt by Turkish military forces in Gara, northern Iraq. In retaliation, T\u00fcrkiye launched Operation Tiger Claw 2 in northern Iraq, killing 48 alleged PKK members. In April, a PKK attack killed one Turkish soldier involved in a counter -PKK operation in T\u00fcrkiye 's eastern Siirt Province. In October, a PKK -planted roadside IED e xploded, killing two electricity company workers in T\u00fcrkiye 's eastern Bing\u00f6l Province. In December, a PKK attack killed three Turkish soldiers during operations close to T\u00fcrkiye 's border in northern Iraq. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security : In 2021, Turkish security forces prevented a total of 101 terrorist attacks \u2014 97 by the PKK, three by ISIS, and one by the violent extreme -leftist DHKP -C terror group, according to T\u00fcrkiye 's Ministry of Interior. Data from the Ministry of Interior indi cates that Turkish forces neutralized 320 ISIS members in 2021, which T\u00fcrkiye defines to mean killed, captured, or otherwise removed from the battlefield. In June, Turkish security forces captured ISIS member Kasim Guler (aka Abu Usama al -Turki), the firs t capture of an ISIS terror suspect on T\u00fcrkiye 's \"red\" top wanted list. Reportedly serving as an ISIS so -called financial officer covering Russia, T\u00fcrkiye , and Europe, Guler allegedly confessed that ISIS had planned to assassinate Turkish political opposi tion leaders, as well as conduct attacks against LGBTQI individuals, tourists, and other groups in T\u00fcrkiye . T\u00fcrkiye 's security forces conducted multiple operations domestically along with counter - PKK military operations in northern Iraq and northern Syri a. According to Ministry of Interior reports, in 2021 a total of 197 PKK members surrendered to Turkish authorities, including several on T\u00fcrkiye 's top wanted list, and security forces detained 7,607 individuals suspected of PKK affiliation. The Turkish National Police (TNP) Migrant Smuggling and Border Gates division has proactively collaborated with DHS Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) to disrupt human smuggling organizations that actively move ISIS, PKK, and members of other nefarious groups acr oss T\u00fcrkiye 's borders. TNP and HSI worked jointly to disrupt a vast network operating in T\u00fcrkiye and arrest its Uzbekistan national ringleader, Rustam Muminov, whose fraudulent document organization provided fake passports and other documents to known mem bers of ISIS to facilitate their travel to European countries. On border security, T\u00fcrkiye has expanded its Risk Analysis Units \u2014 embedded within TNP's Migrant Smuggling and Border Gates division and staffed by TNP intelligence and counterterrorism bra nch officers \u2014 to cover not only its major airports in Istanbul, Antalya, and Ankara, but also regional airports, bus terminals, and border crossings. These units have enhanced T\u00fcrkiye 's security apparatus, preventing the flow of FTFs into the region. As a result, T\u00fcrkiye this year detained more than 1,000 foreigners suspected of terrorist links, who now await deportation. T\u00fcrkiye completed a 145 -kilometer (90 -mile) wall along the Ar -Idr section of T\u00fcrkiye 's eastern border with Iran to prevent ter rorists from entering the country. Since 2015, 837 kilometers of T\u00fcrkiye' s 1,295 -kilometer southern border have been sealed with a border wall. Work continued in 2021 to bolster security with an additional 238 -kilometer stretch along the Iranian border i n the East and 33 kilometers on the border shared with Iraq in the South. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: A member of the FATF, T\u00fcrkiye failed to adequately address deficiencies identified in the 2019 Mutual Evaluation Report, resulting in an October FATF Plenary decision that put T\u00fcrkiye on its gray list. At that time, T\u00fcrkiye committed to a FATF -designed action plan to address these deficiencies. Since the October FATF result, T\u00fcrkiye 's Financial Crimes Investigation Board ( MASAK) has greatly improved its responsiveness to U.S. requests for asset freezes of suspected ISIS or Al-Qa'ida financial facilitators and has started sharing more information. MASAK also has decreased the time it takes to implement new UN designations f rom up to a month to less than 24 hours. The Turkish Parliament approved a new law (effective as of 2021) titled \"Prevention of Financing of the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction,\" reportedly aimed at addressing some of the significant shortcom ings identified by FATF with relation to anti - money laundering and combating financing of terrorism. MASAK created a system to categorize T\u00fcrkiye 's non -profit organizations (NPOs) according to risk criteria and increased its audits of those in what it dee med to be the highest risk categories. MASAK has not publicly released its risk criteria. To date, audits have focused on NPOs working on human rights issues and vulnerable communities, particularly groups that focus on the human rights of LGBTQI+ person s. Before the passage of this new legislation, those suspected of money laundering or raising funds for terrorist groups could be charged only with support for a terrorist group or \"seeking to undermine T\u00fcrkiye 's constitutional order,\" which carries a six - to-15-year prison sentence upon conviction. Now, additional anti - money laundering or countering terrorism finance charges can add jail time. The indiscriminate scope of the new legal provisions on aid collection do not seem to meet the requirements of necessity and proportionality to protect freedom of association, and lack of judicial oversight to authorities could constitute serious infringement of the right of associations to conduct their own affairs. The Venice Commission and other international bodies have issued opinions and recommendations aimed at addressing these deficiencies. Countering Violent Extremism: The TNP undertakes social projects, activities with parents, and in -service training for officers and teachers in all 81 provinces with a concentration on areas where the risk of what T\u00fcrkiye deems radicalization is higher. Programs prepare medical, commu nity, and religious officials for intervening to undermine terrorist messaging and to prevent recruitment. A new program, Hand in Hand to a Safe Future, specifically targets university students vulnerable to recruitment by radical groups. The Ministry of Justice implements some rehabilitation and reintegration programs for convicts and former criminals. T\u00fcrkiye 's Religious Affairs Presidency (the Diyanet) attempts to prevent \"radicalization\" by creating a single Friday sermon it distributes nationally, l eaving no room for dissenting messages. Antalya is a member of the Strong Cities Network. International and Regional Cooperation: T\u00fcrkiye is a member of the UN, NATO, the GCTF, the Committee of Experts on Terrorism of the Council of Europe, the Economi c Community of West African States, and the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. It co-chairs, with Kuwait and the Netherlands, the Defeat -ISIS Coalition's FTF Working Group. T\u00fcrkiye is also a member of the Counter -ISIS Finance and Stabilization Working Grou ps in the coalition. T\u00fcrkiye regularly participates in GCTF meetings and initiatives. T\u00fcrkiye also contributes to the International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law, a GCTF - inspired institution, and provides expert support to assist in training f or judges and prosecutors handling terrorism cases. UNITED KINGDOM (NORTHERN IRELAND) Overview: The UK remained a key U.S. partner in the global fight against terrorism, and counterterrorism cooperation between the two countries was excellent. As a Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS partner, the UK continued to contribute to Iraq and northeast Syria stabilization efforts. The United Kingdom also serves as the coalition's Communications Working Group co -leader, in partnership with the UAE and the U nited States on countering ISIS propaganda and messaging. The UK's terrorism threat level was at the thir d-highest rating (\"substantial\") for most of 2021. On February 4 , the UK lowered the threat level from \"severe\" to \"substantial,\" indicating a terrorist attack remains \"likely\" rather than \"highly likely,\" citing a \"significant reduction in the momentum of attacks in Europe.\" On November 15, following the October 15 st abbing of Sir David Amess , Member of Parliament (MP, Southend West) , and the November 14 Liverpool bombing, the UK increased the threat level to \"severe\" owing to an overall change in the threat picture. UK officials categorize Islamist terrorism as the g reatest threat to national security, though they recognize the growing threat of racially and ethnically motivated terrorism, also referred to as \"extreme right -wing\" terrorism. On November 18 , the Home Office reported that , during the fiscal year ending in March, the UK's Prevent counterterrorism program received more referrals related to extreme right -wing \" radicalization (1,229) than \"Islamist\" radicalization (1,064) for the first time. From 2017 through December, police and security services disrupted 32 plots : 18 related to Islamist extremism , 12 to extreme right -wing extremism , and two to \"left, anarchist, or single -issue terrorism.\" The terrorist threat level for Northern Ireland \u2014 set separately from England, Scotland, and Wales \u2014 remain s severe because of threats from Dissident Republican groups, which remain opposed to British governance and use paramilitary -style attacks and intimidation to exert control over communities. In December , the Independent Reporting Commission published its fourth annual report assessing Loyalist and Republican paramilitarism , which remain a clear and present danger in Northern Ireland. 2021 Terrorist Attacks: The UK suffered two terrorist attacks in 2021 : On October 15 , a British national of Somali heritage fatally stabbed Conservative Sir David Amess , MP, while Amess met with constituents in Leigh -on-Sea, Essex. On November 14, an Iraqi -born asylum seeker killed himself when a homemade explosive charge he manufactured \" with murderous intent\" detonated inside a taxi outside Liverpool Women's Hospital. The taxi driver was the only other individual injured in the blast. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: In April, Parliament passed the Counterterrorism and Sentencing Bill, which increased maximum sentences from 10 to 14 years for three terrorism offenses: membership in a proscribed organization, supporting a proscribed organization, and attending a place used for terrorist training. The Bill created a new, extended post -release probationary regime for terrorism offenders and made it easier to impose stringent restrictions on freedom of association and movement on terrorist activity suspects not yet charged with a crime. UK law enforcement made 188 arr ests for suspected terrorism -related activity, of which 47 resulted in charge s for terrorism -related offenses from 2020 t hrough September, according to Home Office statistics. Of the 58 people convicted of terrorism -related offenses, 45 received sentences of less than 10 years and one received a life sentence. As of September, 218 people were in custody for terrorism -related offenses in the UK, with 154 of these individuals associated with \"Islamist extremism\" and 45 with \"extreme right -wing\" terrorism. In June , the UK launched a consultation on strengthening UK border security by 2025 , using new digital systems. The UK uses advanced biometric screening at some points of entry but lost real -time access to automated DNA and fingerprint comparisons after the Brexit transition period ended at year's end of 2020. Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, the UK was required to modify its systems to effect \"deletion after departure,\" absent specific justification (such as criminality or terrorism). Selective deletion takes time to automate, and the UK has been providing periodic reports to the EU as required. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: The UK is a member of the FATF and has observer or cooperating status in the following FATF -style bodies: the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering, the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti -Money Laundering Group, the Middle East and North Africa FATF, and the Caribbean FATF. The UK FIU is a member of the Egmont Group. The UK is a member of the Defeat -ISIS Coalition's Counter -ISIS Finance Group. The 2018 Sanctions and Anti -Money Laundering Act provided the legal framework to implement sanctions after the UK left the EU. The Money Lau ndering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Regulations 2019 took effect in the beginning of 2020. The UK's domestic counterterrorism sanctions regime \u2014 the Counterterrorism (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 ( known as CT3) \u2014 replaced the Terrorist As set-Freezing Act 2010 when the Brexit transition period terminated at the end of 2020. Countering Violent Extremism: The Commission for Countering Extremism (CCE), a nonstatutory expert committee of the Home Office, published a February report recommending that the government commit to develop ing a \"new legal and operational framework to capture the specific activity of hateful extremism.\" The CCE also published a July report, which explored the range and nature of attitudes, beliefs, or false narratives among the general population, in relation to COVID -19 and \"hateful extremism.\" The CCE's Academic -Practitioner Counte r Extremism Network convened countering -violent - extremism experts from the CCE, government, and academia to align policy, practice, and research. The UK is a contributor to the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund. Birmingham, Derry/Londonderry , Leicester, London, Luton, and Manchester are members of the Strong Cities Network. International and Regional Cooperation: The UK continued to strongly support counterterrorism efforts in the Global Counterterrorism Forum and other regional and multil ateral organizations, to include the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, where it co -leads the Communications Working Group and belongs to the Foreign Terrorist Fighters and Stabilization Working Groups. The UK is a key member of the Five -Country Ministerial, which promotes multilateral ministerial dialogue on border security and counterterrorism. The UK leads Five Eyes efforts to prevent new European data laws from interfering with lawful government access to suspected terrorist content and volun tary industry efforts to report suspected criminal content on their platforms. The UK cooperates with other OSCE participating States in countering terrorism. THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA Overview Terrorist groups continued to operate and maintain safe havens in the Middle East and North Africa throughout 2021. ISIS and its affiliates, al -Qa'ida (AQ) and affiliated groups, and Iran - backed groups cont inue to pose the greatest terrorist threats to the region. ISIS maintained significant operational capabilities and conducted terrorist operations throughout Syria and Iraq, while continuing to promote a large -scale terrorism campaign across the region. While ISIS remains unable to control territory and its leadership ranks have been significantly degraded, the group remains a serious threat to U.S. interests and security in the region and beyond. ISIS fighters continued to wage a low -level insurgency in Iraq and Syria, seeking to destabilize the region, recruit new members, and regain territory. More than 10,000 ISIS fighters, including some 2,000 non -Iraqi and non -Syrian FTFs, remained in Syrian Democratic Forces -controlled detention facilities in no rtheast Syria. More than 70,000 associated foreign family members, most of them children, remain in humanitarian camps for displaced persons. The COVID -19 pandemic continued to present logistical challenges to repatriations, but the United States continu ed to encourage allies and partners to repatriate their citizens and to prosecute or rehabilitate and reintegrate them, as appropriate. Beyond Iraq and Syria, ISIS branches, networks, and supporters across the Middle East and North Africa remained active, including in the Arabian Peninsula, Libya, the Sinai Peninsula, Tunisia, and Yemen. The 85 -member U.S. -led Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS continued its comprehensive efforts to prevent a resurgence of ISIS's so -called physical caliphate in Iraq and Syri a and the activities of its branches and networks. Al-Qa'ida and its affiliates constituted an enduring threat to the United States and its allies and partners in the Middle East and North Africa. These groups remain capable of inflicting damage on our allies and partners and targeting our interests. Al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) continues to linger in the seams between the various parties to Yemen's civil war, despite pressure from the Houthi military campaign in al -Bayda governorate. Though al - Qa'ida's leadership ranks in the Middle East and North Africa continued to be degraded in 2021 and the group suffered setbacks, al -Qa'ida remained a resilient adversary. It actively sought to reconstitute its capabilities and maintain safe havens i n the region amid fragile political and security climates, including in Egypt, Libya, Syria, and Yemen. Iran-supported groups continue to engage in dangerous and destabilizing activity across the Middle East, with Iran using the Islamic Revolutionary Guar d Corps -Qods Force (IRGC -QF) and its proxies and partners to advance its interests abroad. Iran continued to acknowledge the active involvement of the IRGC -QF in the conflicts in Iraq and Syria, the latter in support of the Assad regime. Through the IRGC -QF, Iran continued its support to several U.S. -designated terrorist groups, providing funding, training, weapons, and equipment to various groups within the region. Among the groups receiving support from Iran are Hizballah, Hamas, the Palestine Islamic Jihad, al -Ashtar Brigades and Saraya al -Mukhtar in Bahrain, Kata'ib Hizballah and Asa'ib Ahl al -Haq in Iraq, and Hizballah al -Hijaz in Saudi Arabia. Iran also provided weapons and support to other militant groups in Iraq and Syria, to the Houthis in Yemen , and to the Taliban in Afghanistan. Iran-backed militias continued sporadic attacks on Embassy Baghdad and bases hosting U.S. and other Defeat -ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria. Iranian support and guidance for the Houthis enabled attacks against Saudi Arabia in 2021. These attacks employed armed drones and ballistic missiles, which damaged airports and critical infrastructure. Iran also continued providing Hizballah with the bulk of the group's annual operating budget, an allocation estimated in recent years to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. This support has made Hizballah a dangerous terrorist partner with Iran and the most - capable terrorist organization in Lebanon. It also has enabled Hizballah to project its power throughout the region, including in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and the Persian Gulf. Hizballah's presence in Lebanon and Syria continued to pose a threat to Israel. Israel continued to warn the international community about Hizballah's efforts to produce precision -guided miss iles within Lebanon with Iranian assistance. Hizballah has said that it has enough precision -guided missiles for a confrontation with Israel, but it has denied missiles are being developed in Lebanon. Although Palestinian terrorist groups in the West Ban k and Gaza continued to threaten Israel, Israeli and Palestinian Authority security forces continued their coordination in the West Bank to constrain the ability of these organizations to conduct attacks. ALGERIA Overview: The United States and Algeria built their CT partnership through regular dialogue and exchanges of technical expertise. Algeria continued its significant efforts to prevent terrorist activity within its borders using continu al CT operations to arrest and eliminate terrorist suspects, dismantle and disrupt terrorist cells, and destroy hideouts, arms, and other equipment. These operations, particularly those that eliminated leaders and high -profile members of terrorist groups, substantially diminished their already -limited capacities to operate within Algeria. Al- Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb ( AQIM ) and allied groups, ISIS's Algeria branch, and the local group Jund al -Khilafah in Algeria (Soldiers of the Caliphate in Algeria), remained in the country though in ever -smaller numbers, as they have been unable to attract new recruits or significant new re sources (or in some cases, may have relocated to Mali, an easier operating environment). These groups did not conduct any attacks in 2021. In January , the Algerian Ministry of Defense declared that 2021 would be decisive in eliminating the last terrorist \"remnants\" from the country, and in private and public comments throughout the year some Algerian officials have asserted that Algeria has \"defeated\" terrorism. Embassy Algiers assess es that the country's security forces could credibly reduce the likelih ood of domestic terrorist threats to a negligible level within the next 18 months. Terrorist activity in Libya, Mali, Niger, and Tunisia \u2014 as well as human, weapons, and narcotics trafficking \u2014 contributed to the overall threat, particularly in border regions. Algeria's security apparatus increasingly focused its CT capacity on preventing these elements from projecting into Algeria. Additionally, in 2021 Algerian authorities targeted more frequ ently the Berber separatist Movement for the Self -Determination of Kabylie and the Islamist movement Rachad, which the government designated as terrorist organizations in May. The United States considers these designation s more political than security focused, as both groups are highly critical of the government and do not appear to have committed what the United States defines as terrorist acts. In CT -related engagement with the United States, Algerian authorities have notably refrained from discussing t hese groups or the alleged threats they pose. The government occasionally charged individuals with terrorism -related crimes for activities that appeared to constitute expression and peaceful activism. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: Algeria -based terrorist gr oups did not conduct any domestic attacks in 2021. According to the Algerian Army's yearly report, it neutralized 23 terrorists, arrested 222 terrorists and their supporters, and discovered and destroyed more than 50 terrorist caches and almost 100 homemade bombs and other weapons during CT operations in 2021. Algerian security forces sometimes clashed with violent extremists during these operations, occasionally suffering casualties. While the United States does not assess either to be a terrorist incident, Embassy Algiers has noted two incidents below that are noteworthy for their number of fatalities: Three Algerian soldiers and six terrorists, as defined by Algeria, were killed in clashes during search oper ations in Tipaza Province on January 2 and 3. Sporadic clashes have erupted in the Tipaza region, where the mountainous terrain serves as one of Algeria's last refuges for violent extremists. Five persons died and three were wounded when a truck carrying a group of hunters struck a homemade IED on a remote dirt road in the eastern T \u00e9bessa province on January 14. While initial reports by Algerian authorities and media labeled the incident a \"terrorist attack,\" the government subsequently released no evide nce to suggest the explosion was purposeful or targeted. We assess it was likely old ordnance intended as a defensive measure for the small number of AQIM militants who remain in the area. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: In 2021, Algeria amended its penal code to broaden the definition of terrorist acts and to create a national list of terrorist individuals and entities. The government used the new amendments to detain political activists and outspoken critics of the government. The Algerian judicial system tried and convicted numerous terrorists and their affiliates, and the government maintained its strict \"no concessions\" policy with regard to individuals or groups holding its citizens hostage. Algerian militar y forces and multiple law enforcement, intelligence, and security services addressed CT, counterintelligence, investigations, border security, and crisis response. The Ministry of National Defense's public announcements provided timely reporting on incide nts during which its forces captured or eliminated terrorists, dismantled terrorist cells, and seized equipment and arms. Border security remained a top priority. Algeria and Tunisia continued close CT cooperation to target ISIS strongholds in the bord er area and signed bilateral agreements concerning extradition and mutual legal assistance in December. The Algerian government closely monitored passenger manifests of inbound and outbound flights. In September , Algeria officially created a National Uni t of Passenger Information registry to process and store international passenger information to prevent and counter terrorism and transnational organized crime. This registry supplements Algeria's national API/PNR strategy and commission and its Passenger Information Unit, which operates under the General Directorate of Customs. Government officials made active use of INTERPOL databases at ports of entry. Algerian law enforcement agencies participated in training and exchanges offered by the U.S. gover nment and by third countries. Algerian participants attended numerous workshops conducted under the auspices of the GCTF, the UN, the EU, the African Union (AU) , and other multilateral organizations. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Algeria is a member of the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENATATF) . In 2021 , the government passed an executive decree to strengthen and refine the country's FIU, known as the Financial Intelligence Processing Unit, which is a member of the Egmont Group. Countering Violent Extremism: There were n o significant changes in 2021. International and Regional Cooperation: Algeria continued to support CT and security efforts through participation in international, multilateral, and regional organizations. It engages actively with UN affiliates such as UNODC and the United Nations Office of Counterterrorism . The country is an active member of the GCTF and co -chairs the GCTF's Capacity Building in the West Africa Region Working Group , hosting and participating in numerous workshops and working group meetings. Algeria plays a leading role in CT -related matters in the AU. The nation hosts, in Algiers , the headquarters of A fripol and the AU's Center for Study and Research on Terrorism. In September , the AU's Peace and Security Council adopted Algeria's proposed \"action plan\" to address growing violent extremist threats in the Sahel. Algeria remains chair of the implementation committee for the peace accord in Mali and continues to support the UN pol itical process in Libya. Algeria also hosted and participated in various Sahelian -Saharan fora to discuss development and security policies and the evolution of regional terrorism. Regional tensions between Morocco and Algeria remained an impediment to bilateral and regional CT cooperation. BAHRAIN Overview: There were no successful terrorist attacks in Bahrain in 2021, but domestic security forces conducted numerous operations to preempt and disrupt attack planning. On February 6, Ministry of Interior security forces thwarted a plot to detonate explosives at two National Bank of Bahrain automated teller machines ( ATMs ) in the al -Naim and Jidhafs areas in Manama. In September, four individuals were arrested for setting fire to a Bahrain National Bank ATM; the Ministry of Interior also accused them of being funded by the Iran -based al -Wafa group. The Government of Bahra in is a member of the Riyadh -based Terrorist Financing Targeting Center (TFTC) and supports U.S. government counterterrorism efforts. Bahrain hosts the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet and the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command and participates in U.S. -led military coalitions, including the International Maritime Security Construct and the Counter Maritime Task Force. Bahrain continued to offer support for countering Iran's malign activities in the region. The Government of Bahrain initiated numerous programs inte nded to improve relations between the community and security forces. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorist attacks reported in Bahrain in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: On September 29 , the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated a regional Hizballah terrorism -financing network in a coordinated action against the group with Bahraini authorities. On October 5, Bahrain 's Attorney General Dr. Ali bin Fadl al -Buainain announced that pros ecutors had charged three individuals in Bahrain and one individual in Qatar with terror finance and money laundering in connection to the network. In September , the High Criminal Court found 13 men guilty of being part of a major terrorism cell and of planning several attacks in Bahrain. The court said the men, whose ages ranged from 21 to 37, were part of Saraya al -Ashtar (Al -Ashtar Brigades) and that seven of them had trained in Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps camps in Iran. In November , the Ministry of Interior arrested 14 individuals for plotting terrorist operations \"against security and civil peace,\" confiscating weapons and explosives it alleged came from Iran. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Bahrain is a member of MENAFATF. Its Financial Intelligence Unit is known as the Financial Intelligence Directorate (FID). In 2021 , the head of Bahrain's FID was elected the regional representative of the Egmont Group. Bahrain is also a member of the Defeat -ISIS Coalition's Counter -ISIS Finance Group and the TFTC. In 2021, Bahrain ranked first in the Arab region and second in the Middle East on the Basel Anti -Money Laundering (AML) Index , with a score of 4.5 points; it was Bahrain's second consecutive year leading the region on the AML Index. As part of broader efforts to implement the recommendations set forth in its 2018 Financial Action Task Force Mutual Evaluation Report, over the last two years the Government of Bahrain established a Ministerial Committee to Combat E xtremism, Money Laundering, and the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), chaired by the Minister of Interior. In addition to Edict 12 outlining the sanctions and designations authorities of the AML/CFT committee, the Government of Bahrain promulgated more th an 30 laws to strengthen AML/CFT regulation, including requiring the disclosure of ultimate beneficial corporate ownership and eliminating cash real estate transactions. Further, the Public Prosecution created a specialized unit dedicated to money launder ing crimes. Countering Violent Extremism: The Government of Bahrain continued public outreach initiatives such as a community police program that works to bridge the divide between the Bahraini Shia community and police force in neighborhoods and public schools. The Ministry of Interior continued to implement the Bahrain una (\"Our Bahrain\") initiative to promote a shared, national Bahraini identity. Specially Designated Global Terrorists Saraya al -Mukhtar and Al -Ashtar Brigades seek to destabilize Bahraini society and pave the way for Iran to exert greater influence in Bahrain. According to a UN Counterterrorism Center's 2020 Quarterly Report recommendation, the Government of Bahrain should work to increase awareness, build trust, and enhance civil society capacity to adhere to national regulations in a manner commensu rate to the risk posed to the non -profit sector by terrorist groups. The Ministry of Interior 's drug abuse and CVE prevention program, Ma'an, in partnership with DARE USA is available in 80 percent of Bahraini government schools. Ma 'an worked in partn ership with the University of North Carolina and DARE USA to develop a tolerance and CVE student curriculum as part of the National Action Plan to Combat Extremism. International and Regional Cooperation: As of December , the Bahrain Defense Force maintained small, deployed elements in Saudi Arabia and Yemen as part of the Saudi -led coalition against the Iran -backed Houthis and al -Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula. Bahrain is a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Organization of Islamic Cooperat ion, and the Arab League. Mission Manama facilitated seven Anti terrorism Assistance (ATA) courses with the Ministry of Interior: Investigating Terrorist Incidents ; Police Leaders Role in Combating Terrorism ; Combating Domestic and Transnational Terrorism ; Fraudulent Document Recognition and Behavioral Analysis ; Maritime Port and Harbor Security Management ; Combating Domestic and Transnational Terrorism; and Explosive Incident Countermeasures. In October , the Department of Justice's Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training and Department of State's Bureau of Diplomatic Security's ATA program successfully completed the first of five phases in the Counter -Lebanese Hizballah Training Program , which builds terrorism investigations and prosecutions capabilities through information integration and capacity building. In August , the DOJ OPDAT program trained Bahrain's Public Prosecution Office and FID on enhanced AML/CFT best practices, including methods to combat terrorism finance. EGYPT Overview: Egypt experienced a significant decrease in terrorist activity in 2021 , compared with previous years. Egypt is committed to counterterrorism and countering violent extremism. Egypt continued its military campaign and social development programs in North Sinai, where a degraded ISIS -Sinai Province (ISIS -SP) targeted security forces, pro -government Bedouin groups, and civilians. In March, Egyptian security forces killed a senior ISIS -SP commander. In September , a high -profile ISIS -SP religious figure, reported to be behind the deadly 2017 Rouda Mosque attack, defected. Huma n rights organizations have raised concerns over reports of civilians allegedly killed during military operations in North Sinai. Accurate numbers for civilian, military, and terrorist casualties remain elusive because of security constraints in North Sin ai and limited press, social media, and government reporting. As of early 2021, Egypt 's Supreme Standing Committee for Human Rights reported that the Egyptian government spent $224 million (out of a total $260 million budgeted) through 2020 on compensatio n (for property damaged in counterterrorism operations) and economic development to support North Sinai residents. While the Egyptian government announced it would not renew the national state of emergency in October, other laws give the government specia l powers in North Sinai where counterterrorism operations are focused. The government continued to periodically use terrorism -related charges to prosecute individuals for what appeared to constitute peaceful expression and activism. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: Based on government press releases, as well as social media and other local reporting, at least 90 terrorist incidents took place in the Sinai Peninsula and claimed about 200 casualties. ISIS-SP claimed most of the attacks. Like prior years, the methodology for the attacks included small arms attacks, IEDs, VBIEDs, kidnappings, murders (or killings) , complex assaults, ambushes, and targeted assassinations. There was a significant decrease in the number, frequency, and severity of IEDs, VBIEDs, and complex operations with large -scale casualties against Egyptian security forces. Opportunistic IED and sniper attacks appeared to constitute most security force casualties. On August 12 , the Egyptian military announced the death o f nine soldiers and 13 militants during undated clashes. Social media and ISIS -SP reporting claimed an IED attack on an M60 MBT and an armored vehicle during that timeframe. On July 31, ISIS -SP killed at least five Egyptian soldiers and injured another six near Sheikh Zuweid during an ambush on a checkpoint, according to the press and a statement from Egyptian officials. In mid -May, ISIS -SP media accounts claimed seven attacks with nine casualties, including Egyptian security forces and pro -government Bedouin tribe members. On March 24, dozens of alleged ISIS -SP members stormed a town near Bir al -Abd and kidnapped at least 14 civilians, according to social media and local pres s. While ISIS -SP was the only group to publicly claim responsibility for attacks during the year, Harakat Sawa'd Misr and AQ -allied groups such as Ansar al -Islam remain groups of concern. Local security services were aware of attempts by unknown individu als to target churches and infrastructure across the year. Separately, security forces conducted and publicized occasional raids on weapons caches throughout Egypt, including in Cairo. Some of the raids resulted in the deaths of several individuals who w ere the intended targets of the raids. The government attributed those weapons caches to criminal elements rather than to terrorist organizations. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The Egyptian government announced it would not renew the nationwide state of emergency on October 25, which had been in effect since 2017 (and previously during 1981 -2012). Human rights groups and international NGOs reported the government continued to use counterterrorism authorities to pursue activists, political candidates, and critics. President Sisi also ratified amendments to the 2015 Antiterrorism Law : Authoriz ing the Egyptian president to delegate presidential authority to issue orders imposing evacuations, curfews, or isolation in an identified region for six months in case of terrorism or environmental disasters. Increas ing the penalty for filming, recording, broadcasting, or displaying any facts from court sessions in \"terrorist crimes\" witho ut the permission of the head of the court. Broaden ing the definition of funds to include a variety of assets tied to what the Egyptian government determined to be extremist ideology. Establish ing a compulsory requirement for local authorities to provide information relating to money laundering . Outlining requirements for the authorities to publish statistics on its activities countering terror financing. Amendments to the Penal Code criminalize d the collection or publication of statistics, information, or data on the Egyptian Armed Forces without written permission from the Ministry of Defense. The Egyptian government also tightened financing laws, which they described as part of the effort to combat terrorism. The Prime Minister's Decision No. 104 of 2021 prohibited non -profit organizations from conducting any activities related to terrorism or money laundering. These changes created administrative burdens, such as unclear reporting requireme nts, and increased the Egyptian government's oversight of employment and financial data based on its expansive view of what constitutes supporting or financing terrorism. The Egyptian government continued to expand its partnerships on land and maritime border security initiatives, particularly along its borders with Libya, Gaza, and Sudan. At border crossings and airports, Egyptian authorities continued to authenticate travel documents, conduct checks on individuals, and share derogatory inform ation among border authorities for further action. Egypt maintains a terrorist watchlist for Egyptian immigration officials at the ports of entry, with detailed information maintained by the security services ; this list occasionally included peaceful huma n rights activists and journalists. The United States assisted Egypt's counterterrorism efforts by providing training, equipment, and other assistance to its law enforcement and armed forces. In North Sinai in 2021, Egyptian security operations significantly degraded ISIS -SP. The Egyptian government continued to conduct military operations and limited airstrikes in the Sinai Peninsula to target terrorists. A significant number of civilians returned to villages in North Sinai Governorate in late 2021 following an Egyptian Armed Forces campaign to push ISIS -SP from those areas. The Egyptian government remains highly aware of the dangers in North Sinai. Transit into and out of the Sinai Peninsula remains tight ly controlled , and towns in North Sinai \u2014 particularly Bir al -Abd, Rafah, and Sheikh Zuweid \u2014 are closely monitored as the Egyptian government seeks to eradicate terrorist activity in the area. Human rights organizations claimed a video released in August by the armed forces to depict Egypt's counterterrorism efforts shows two extrajudicial killings in North Sinai. Egypt denies the allegation. The Egyptian government provided compensation to North Sinai residents for property damaged in counterterrorism operations, compensation for the families of those killed or injured, as well as humanitarian/medical aid and social assistance, although North Sinai residents continued to lodge grievances about compensation calculations and disbursements. Local media an d government announcements spotlighted economic development efforts to showcase government investments in education, public infrastructure, and land dispute resolution tied to development projects as longer -term solutions to deter extremism. The United States continued to support Egypt's efforts to combat ISIS -SP and other terrorist groups in Egypt by sustaining and providing AH -64 Apache helicopters, mine -resistant and ambush -protected vehicles, counter -IED training, mobile sensor towers, and border sec urity training programs. The United States routinely engages in bilateral discussions regarding strategies to defeat ISIS -SP and other terrorist groups in Egypt, to further efforts to mitigate the risk of civilian harm and encourage credible investigation into any allegations of human rights violations and abuses. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Egypt is a member of MENAFATF. Its Financial Intelligence Unit, the Egyptian Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Combating Unit, is a member of the Egmont Group and the National Council of Payments. Egypt also is a member of the Defeat -ISIS Coalition's Counter -ISIS Finance Group. Countering Violent Extremism: CVE efforts remain an ongoing focus of the Egyptian government. The Ministry of Awqaf and the Ministry of Education highlighted ongoing efforts to demonstrate the threat of \"extremist ideology\" and promote youth programs and curricula on respect and moder ation. Al-Azhar, a global leader in Islamic learning, maintains an observatory for combating online violent extremism (with a team of analysts working in 13 different languages) that challenges and debunks propaganda from ISIS and other violent extremist groups, and announced a forthcoming translation of the Quran into Hebrew. International and Regional Cooperation: Egypt participated in the UN' s 2021 Counterterrorism Week and contributed to the UN 's 2021 Counterterrorism Strategy, and regional -level c ounterterrorism organizations focused on border security. Egypt is a member of the GCTF and co -chairs the GCTF's Capacity Building in the East Africa Region Working Group . Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs published its second -ever annual counterterrorism report outlining progress and updates. IRAQ Overview: Iraq's primary terrorist threats included ISIS remnants and various Iran -aligned militia groups (IAMGs), -designated -Nujaba, and Asa'ib Ahl al -Haq, as well as smaller militias claiming to be a part of Iraq's \"I slamic Resistance.\" The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a designated terrorist group primarily located in the mountains of northern Iraq and in southeastern T\u00fcrkiye , conducted multiple attacks in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region (IKR) resulting in the deaths of several Kurdish security forces (Peshmerga) personnel. ISIS, though severely diminished in capacity, continued to conduct operations, particularly in northern and western rural areas with limited Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) presence. ISIS soug ht to reestablish footholds in Anbar, Diyala, Kirkuk, Ninewa, and Salah al -Din provinces, especially in the gaps between those areas frequently patrolled by the Peshmerga and ISF. Although ISIS conducted deadly terrorist attacks in Iraq, those attacks res ulted in fewer casualties nationwide in 2021 than in previous years. Methods included bombings, indirect fire, IEDs, sniper fire, and ambushes. Iraq remained a pivotal member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and a participant in all Coalition Worki ng Groups (Foreign Terrorist Fighter, Counter -ISIS Finance Group, Stabilization, and Communications). Iraq's Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) conducted about 170 counterterrorist operations against ISIS during 2021, often with Defeat -ISIS Coalition support . Iraqi counterterrorism functions were principally executed by the CTS, a cabinet -level entity reporting directly to the prime minister, as well as by various security forces under the Ministries of Defense and Interior, and the Peshmerga. In limited instances, Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) augmented Iraqi Army and CTS -led operations. All PMF were required by law to operate under the command and control of the prime minister. However, Iran-aligned militia groups , including many within the PMF, de fied central government command and control and engaged in violent and destabilizing activities in Iraq and in neighboring Syria, including killing and abducting people protesting militia corruption. The number of a ttacks by IAMGs against U.S. interests r esulting in the killing and wounding of Iraqi service members and locals remained about the same in 2021 as in 2020. Media reported Turkish airstrikes against the PKK in northern Iraq resulted in civilian casualties, including children. 2021 Terrorist I ncidents: Terrorists conducted more than 100 IED attacks on Defeat -ISIS- contracted convoys and launched at least 40 indirect fire attacks against U.S. interests in Iraq. Major terrorist incidents include d the following : On January 21, two suicide bombers attacked an open -air market in central Baghdad, killing 32 and injuring 110. ISIS claimed responsibility, saying it had targeted Shiites. Iran-aligned militias launched several drone and rocket attacks against Erbil Airbase; one such rock et attack on February 15 led to the death of a U.S. contractor. On April 18, Balad Air Base was struck by four 107mm rockets. On July 5, Ayn al- Asad Air Base was targeted with seven 122mm rockets. On July 7, Ayn al-Asad was targeted with 14 122mm rockets , impacting on -compound from a suspected multiple rocket launcher. On July 19 an ISIS suicide bomber killed at least 35 and wounded dozens more in a crowded market in the Sadr City district of Baghdad. On October 26, ISIS attacked Al -Hawasha village in th e Muqdadiya district of Diyala province, killing 13 civilians and wounding seven others. On November 7, an IAMG drone attack targeted the Iraqi prime minister's residence. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The Iraqi government improved the security of the International Zone before the October national election. Iraq did not significantly change its counterterrorism legal and law enforcement framework. Human rights groups reported that authorities arrested suspects in security sweeps w ithout warrants, particularly under the antiterrorism law, and frequently held such detainees for prolonged periods without charge. The groups also allege courts routinely accepted forced confessions as evidence, and in some ISIS -related cases this was th e only evidence. Border security and corruption remained a critical vulnerability, as the Border Guard Security Force (BGSF) had limited capability to fully secure Iraq's borders with Syria and Iran. Border security was administered by the BGSF, with I SF or Peshmerga deployed behind them. The border with Syria near T\u00fcrkiye remained especially porous, and border areas with Iran were generally controlled by IAMGs. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Export Control and Related Border Security began a two -year train -the-trainer program for several hundred Iraqi border guards. While the Ministry of Interior shared biometric information upon request on suspected terrorists with the United States, IN TERPOL, and other partners, a biometric information -sharing program was not finalized by the government. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Iraq was a member of MENAFATF , as well as the Counter -ISIS Finance Group. The Government of Iraq \u2014 including the Central Bank, law enforcement, security forces, and judiciary in Baghdad and the IKR \u2014 continued to target ISIS financial networks and safeguard Iraq's financial institutions. Iraq worked to strengthen its AML/CFT regime. Iraq's FIU was no t a member of the Egmont Group, which limited Iraq's ability to exchange information with other FIUs on illicit finance issues; but Iraq worked toward membership. To compensate, the FIU signed six MOUs with peer FIUs, including one signed with T\u00fcrkiye in November. In November, Iraq advised the public about the risks of virtual assets, although the government had not implemented any regulations governing cryptocurrency use. Countering Violent Extremism: Iraq continued strategic messaging to discredit ISIS, in part by providing significant content to the Coalition Communications Cell. Many Iraqi ISIS fighters remained in Iraqi custody, while many Iraqi civilians, including some family members of ISIS memb ers, remained in displaced persons camps. Iraq acknowledged that the return and social reintegration of family members of suspected ISIS supporters, as well as the provision of fair and equal justice, is important to prevent future terrorism and violent radicalization. However, almost 1.2 million Iraqis remained displaced within Iraq and an estimated 30,000 Iraqis \u2014 almost entirely women and children \u2014 resided in Al-Hol refugee camp in Syria. The Government of Iraq repatriated 300 suspected ISIS fighters from northeast ern Syria detention facilities as well as 1,779 Iraqi nationals, mostly women and children from Al-Hol. IAMGs routinely used threatening messaging to promote violent extremism and protect their power throughout Iraq. International and Regional Cooperation: Iraq continued to work with multilateral and regional organizations \u2014 including the UN, the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, NATO, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation , INTERPOL, and the League of Arab States \u2014 to support counterterrorism efforts. ISRAEL , AND THE WEST BANK , AND GAZA STRIP Israel Overview: Israel remained a committed counterterrorism partner, closely coordinating with the United States on a range of counterterrorism initiatives. Owing to COVID -19, Israel and the United States held virtual interagency counterterrorism dialogues to collaborate on regional threats. Counterterrorism issues were also at the center of the agenda during numerous high - level U.S. visits to Israel. Israel faced threats along its northern and northeastern frontier from Hizballah and other Iran - backed groups, including as many as 150,000 rockets and missiles aimed at Israel, according to some Israeli estimates. Israeli officials expressed concern that Iran w as supplying Hizballah with advanced weapons systems and technologies, including precision -guided missiles. This concern included Iran's work to assist Hizballah and other proxies in indigenously producing rockets, missiles, and drones. To the South, Israel faced threats from terrorist organizations including Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and ISIS -Sinai Province. During the May escalation between Israel and Hamas, Hamas fired thousands of rockets into Israel from Gaza over 11 days, causing casualties. Other sporadic rocket attacks resulted in several injuries and property damage. The May escalation also saw a spike in intercommunal violence. There were attempts to infiltrate Israel from Gaza by armed militants (mostly during the May escala tion), none of which resulted in Israeli casualties. Other sources of terrorist threats included the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and lone -actor attacks. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that the number of deaths from terrorist incidents had been the lowest in a decade. Nonetheless, Israel still experienced terrorist attacks involving weapons ranging from rockets and mortars to vehicular attacks, small arms, and knives. According to the Mini stry of Foreign Affairs, combined property damage as a result of incendiary balloons and rockets from Gaza during the year totaled $61.7 million. The following is a representative list of IDF -identified incidents: In May, Hamas and other terrorist groups, including PIJ, launched more than 4,400 rockets and numerous incendiary balloons from Gaza toward Israel, many of which targeted civilian areas. Rockets from Hamas killed 13 civilians in Israel; Iron Dome, Israel's air defense system, in tercepted the vast majority of the rockets destined for populated areas. Israeli retaliatory airstrikes and errant Hamas rockets killed 256 Palestinians, of whom 128 were civilians, per UN figures. Estimates of Palestinians killed by Hamas rockets that f ell short in Gaza are disputed, with some NGOs stating that as few as 20 were killed in this manner, and others putting the number at 91. The May escalation with Hamas sparked social and intercommunal violence that resulted in property damage and casualties. Three Arab Israeli residents of Jaffa allegedly threw firebombs in Jaffa's Ajami neighborhood, and 12 -year-old Mohammed Jintzai sustai ned serious injuries in one of those attacks. Three suspects were arrested and charged with planning and perpetrating terror attacks, and for the illegal possession of weapons. The State Attorney's Office also indicted seven Arab Israelis and Palestinian s (five Israeli citizens and two residents of the West Bank) for terror offenses, including the murder of Yigal Yehoshua in Lod on May 11, for throwing stones, harming a vehicle, and obstructing justice. Four Jewish Israelis were arrested for assaulting, stabbing, and seriously wounding a Palestinian man in Jerusalem, and a similar assault carried out by a different group of young Jewish men also took place in Jerusalem later in the year. Police arrested 2,142 suspects, seized 970 illegal weapons and ammu nition, and filed 184 indictments (some against more than one suspect) because of the May violence. On September 30, a 30 -year-old Palestinian woman attempted to stab police officers at the Chain Gate entrance to the Haram al -Sharif/Temple Mount (HAS/TM), according to press reports. Police shot and killed her, then briefly closed one HAS/TM gate and the Damascus Gate in the aftermath of the attack. On November 21, a Hamas militant opened fire in Jerusalem's Old City, killing one person and wounding four others (one seriously) before Israeli police fatally shot him. Israeli officials said Eliyahu Kay, a 26 -year-old immigrant from South Africa, was killed in the shooting. Police identified the attacker as a 42 -year-old Palestinian, Fadi Abu Shkhaidem, a t eacher at a nearby high school in East Jerusalem. On December 3, a 25 -year-old Palestinian resident of the West Bank repeatedly stabbed a Jewish civilian outside Damascus Gate in East Jerusalem, then attacked two Border Police officers who shot and ult imately killed the attacker. On December 8, a Palestinian minor stabbed 26 -year-old Moriah Cohen in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem, as Cohen was taking her children to daycare. Although stabbed in the back, Cohen was only lightly injure d. The suspect was arrested later in the day at her school. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Israel has a robust legal framework to combat terrorism and promote international legal assistance in the investigation and prosecution of terrorists. Israeli security forces took law enforcement actions against suspected terrorists and terrorist groups. On November 24, the Shin Bet said it had uncovered a major Hamas cell of more than 50 operatives in the West Bank seeking t o commit terror attacks, including within Israel. The Shin Bet added that it found a variety of weapons, including materials for assembling four explosive belts. This was the first case in more than five years in which Israel had disrupted a major Hamas plot to resume suicide bombings. On October 22, the Israeli Defense Ministry issued a military order designating six Palestinian NGOs under Israel's 2016 Counterterrorism Law as affiliates of the PFLP, which is a U.S. -designated FTO. Countering the Fin ancing of Terrorism: The 2019 Israeli Deduction Law requires the Ministry of Finance to withhold from its monthly tax revenue transfers to the Palestinian Authority (PA) the amounts Israel estimates the PA pays to Palestinians connected to terrorism, including to the families of terrorists who died in attacks. The PA calls these prisoner and \"martyr\" payments, and argues they are social payments for families who have lost their primary breadwinner. The United States and Israel argue the payments incentiv ize and reward terrorism, particularly given the higher monthly payments the longer an individual remains imprisoned, which corresponds to more severe crimes. The Jerusalem Post estimates that \"martyr\" payments total $152.3 million annually. According to the PA, during 2021 Israeli deductions from clearance revenues for prisoner and \"martyr\" payments amounted to $259.74 million, although this amount was expected to be reduced to $192 million in 2022. In January, senior Palestinian officials told the Times of Israel that the PA was willing to base the stipends on prisoners' financial needs rather than the length of their sentence. However, at year's end this suggested policy change had not occurred. In September, the Israeli Coordinator of Government A ctivities in the Territories estimated that resolving the prisoner and \"martyr\" payments issue \"would unlock over a billion shekels [$314 million].\" Countering Violent Extremism: There were no updates in 2021. International and Regional Cooperation: Collaborative counterterrorism efforts continued among Israeli intelligence services, their partners in Europe and Australia, and the United States. According to Israeli officials, these efforts have successfully thwarted terrorist attacks by ISIS, Hizb allah, and other violent extremist groups over the past several years. The West Bank and Gaza Strip Overview: The IDF, under the Israeli Ministry of Defense, is responsible for the West Bank, but PA security forces were granted security control of 17.5 percent (called Area A) under the 1993 Oslo Accords. The PA has administrative control over Area B (about 22 p ercent of the West Bank), but security control is shared with Israeli authorities. Israel maintains all administrative and security control of Area C, which comprises 61 percent of the West Bank. PA security forces and the IDF continued counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts in parts of the West Bank, where U.S. -designated FTOs such as Hamas, PIJ, and the PFLP operated. PA security forces constrained the ability of those organizations to conduct attacks, including arresting Hamas members. PA secur ity forces continue to proactively arrest individuals planning attacks against Israeli targets or those suspected of supporting terrorist organizations, and continue to arrest Palestinians wanted for weapons smuggling or illegal weapons possession. The U nited States, through the multinational office of the U.S. Security Coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority, worked with the PA Ministry of Interior and PA security forces on reform efforts and training, including counterterrorism. Accordi ng to the Israeli Ministry of Public Security, \"the West Bank saw 39 terror attacks in 2021, down from the IDF's reported figure of 60 in 2020.\" Numbers accounting for terrorist attacks in the West Bank vary slightly depending on the source \u2014 the IDF, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), or human rights groups such as B'Tselem. While this decrease was partially attributable to greater movement restrictions imposed during the COVID -19 pandemic, it also reflected a general d ownward trend in certain violence indicators since 2016, such as deaths of Israelis, deaths of Palestinians, and terrorist attacks in the West Bank. However, these figures do not account for settler violence against Palestinians and their property, which increased over the last year. Hamas, a U.S. -designated FTO and Specially Designated Global Terrorist, maintained de facto control over Gaza in 2021. Hamas and several militant groups, including Sunni violent extremist groups such as PIJ, launched an es timated 4,400 rocket attacks against Israel from Gaza. Hamas and its affiliates launched incendiary balloons and devices toward Israel, damaging farms and nature preserves. Hamas and PIJ tunneling activities continued. Live ammunition from Hamas's anti -aircraft weapons struck buildings in Israel. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: Terrorist incidents during the year included the following: On May 2, assailants in a passing vehicle shot and injured three Israelis near Tapuach Junction/Za'tara Checkpoint south of Nablus, then fled the scene. One of the victims, Yehuda Guetta, died as a result of his injuries. Israeli authorities set up checkpoints, resulting in clashes with youths during which five were shot. Medics said the three persons inj ured in the attack were men in their late teens or early 20s. They were taken to Petah Tikva's Beilinson Hospital for treatment. The perpetrator of the drive -by shooting attack was a U.S. citizen, Muntassir Shalabi, according to media reports. The Shin Bet did not believe he had any affiliation with Palestinian terror groups. He was arrested four days after the attack, and later sentenced to two life sentences. On August 21, a Palestinian militant from Gaza approached a border post and shot an IDF sold ier at point -blank range during Hamas -organized border clashes in which several Palestinians were also killed. The soldier later succumbed to his wounds. On September 30, a 30 -year-old Palestinian woman attempted to stab police officers at the Chain Gate entrance to HAS/TM, according to press reports. Police shot and killed her, then briefly closed one HAS/TM gate and the Damascus Gate in the aftermath of the attack. On November 21, a Hamas militant opened fire in Jerusalem's Old City, killing one a nd wounding four others (one seriously) before Israeli police fatally shot him. Israeli officials said Eliyahu Kay, a 26 -year-old immigrant from South Africa, was killed in the shooting. Police identified the attacker as a 42 -year-old Palestinian, Fadi A bu Shkhaidem, a teacher at a nearby high school in East Jerusalem. On December 3, a 25 -year-old Palestinian resident of the West Bank repeatedly stabbed a Jewish civilian outside Damascus Gate in East Jerusalem, then attacked two Border Police officers wh o shot and ultimately killed the attacker. On December 8, a Palestinian minor stabbed 26 -year-old Moriah Cohen in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem, as Cohen was taking her children to daycare. Although stabbed in the back, Cohen was only lightly injured. The suspect was arrested later in the day at her school. On December 16, near the Homesh settlement, three Palestinians in a car shot and killed Yehuda Dimentman. They were later arrested. Israeli settlers living in the West Bank committed a variety of physical attacks, proper ty damage, and \"nationalistic\" crimes against Palestinians, some of which caused serious injury, according to Israeli human rights organizations and media reports. Multiple sources reported a substantial rise in such attacks during 2021. UN monitors docu mented 496 Israeli settler attacks against Palestinians, including 370 attacks that resulted in property damage, and 126 attacks that resulted in casualties, three of which were fatal. This is an increase from the 358 settler attacks UN OCHA documented in 2020, 84 of which resulted in casualties. According to the UN, Israeli settlers cut down more than 12,300 trees and vandalized over 330 Palestinian -owned vehicles. The Shin Bet registered 397 settler attacks, an increase from the 272 violent incidents in 2020, according to Israeli press reports. Human rights groups and West Bank residents reported settler attacks over the last year were also expanded in severity and scale. Whereas in prior years groups of four to five settlers typically carried out sporadic attacks, the UN documented attacks by groups of 20 or more settlers during the year, indicating that attacks were likely preplanned. Attacks were also more destructive and expanded into parts of the West Bank, such as Area A, that were previously not sullied by settler violence. In one high -profile attack in September, dozens of settlers attacked the village of Um Faggarah in the middle of the day, targeting women and children, and resulted in a four -year old Palestinian boy's skull being fractur ed by a large rock, which settlers reportedly threw onto him while he was sleeping. Such incidents generated significant concern among parts of the Israeli security establishment and a series of public condemnations from government officials, including th e Israeli Defense Minister Gantz and the Minister for Public Safety Bar Lev, who labeled settler violence as terrorism. In response, Israeli National Police and the Ministry of Defense announced a series of measures, including reform of the police unit re sponsible for handing far -right violent extremism in the West Bank to enable a faster response to violence by targeting hotspots. Despite these efforts, Israeli security personnel often did not prevent settler attacks and rarely detained or charged perpet rators of settler violence. Only one settler was convicted (and sentenced to 20 months in prison) in 2021, for throwing a stun grenade at a Palestinian home, injuring two and causing significant damage. Some Israeli NGOs allege IDF presence during some a ttacks and accuse the IDF of enabling a permissive environment by its lack of enforcement. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There were no changes in 2021. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: The Palestinian Authority is a member of MENAFATF. Its financial intelligence unit, the Palestinian Financial Follow -Up Unit, is a member of the Egmont Group. The PA's MENAFATF mutual evaluation was postponed from 2020 to 2022 -23 because of the COVID -19 pandemic. Countering Violent Extrem ism: Despite a PA policy of prohibiting content that incites violence, the PA has been inconsistent in enforcement. Official PA traditional and social media accounts, affiliated with the ruling political faction Fatah, featured content praising or condon ing acts of terrorism. For example, the Fatah Youth movement at An -Najah National University praised the December killing of Yehuda Dimentman as a \"heroic operation.\" In another instance during the year, Fatah's Facebook page referred to a Palestinian ma n who had stabbed and injured an Orthodox Jewish man in Jerusalem as a \"martyr\" after the attacker was shot by police. Problems continued with misleading textbooks, some with maps not depicting Israel, and public ceremonies celebrating Palestinian \"martyr s.\" Palestinian authorities pledged to reform Palestinian textbooks, but an EU report issued in February showed that instances of antisemitism and incitement to violence continued to appear in textbooks. Palestinian President Abbas continued to state a commitment to nonviolence, a two-state solution, and previous Palestine Liberation Organization commitments, but others in the Palestinian leadership have avoided making such commitments. The Palestinian leadership continued to offer prisoner and \"martyr\" payments to families of Palestinians who were wounded or died while committing terrorist acts or in connection with terrorism. International and Regional Cooperation: Palestinian Authority justice, security leaders, and PA security force personnel continued to participate in regional conferences and meetings to combat terrorism, though in 2021 COVID -19 pandemic restrictions limited these opportunities. JORDAN Overview: Jordan remained a committed partner on counterterrorism and countering violent extremism in 2021. As a regional leader in the Defeat -ISIS Global Coalition, Jordan played an important role in coalition successes in degrading the terrorist group's territori al control and operational reach. Although Jordan did not experience a successful terrorist attack in 2021, the country faced a continued threat from terrorist groups. While the Jordanian security forces thwarted plots and apprehended suspected terrorist s, the threat of domestic radicalization to violence, especially online, persisted. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorism incidents in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There were no significant changes in counterterrorism legislation, law enforcement capacity, or the State Security Court. The General Intelligence Directorate (GID) is the primary government agency respo nsible for counterterrorism, although the Public Security Directorate's (PSD 's) Police Special Operations (PSO) group is the primary responder to an active terrorist incident. These two organizations operate with support from various elements within the J ordan Armed Forces and PSD's Gendarmerie. In 2021 , the Jordanian government continued to implement measures and conduct joint exercises to improve interagency coordination among security agencies, although COVID -19 prevented some training. Enhanced overt security measures continued to be in place across Jordan, most visibly at some hotels and shopping malls. Jordan continued to reinforce its border defenses and surveillance capabilities in response to terrorist and criminal threats emanating from its 230-mile border with Syria and 112 -mile border with Iraq. Jordan also participated in the Department of State's Antiterrorism Assistance program focusing on strengthening the security service's counterterrorism capabilities. During 2021, Jordanian authorities took legal action against numerous individuals accused of terrorism under Jordanian law, including rulings on previous years' cases of terrorism. In an interview published October 5, GID Director Ahmed Husni Hatuqay stated that since he took up his post in May 2019, GID had thwarted 120 operations, including 52 terrorist plots, and arrested 103 persons involved in planning attacks in Jordan. The GID also contributed to stopping an additional 68 terrorist plots globally. While Husni Hatuqay did not specify how many operations occurred in 2021, Jordanian media noted the disruption of several terrorist plots, including the following : In March , the GID disrupted a terrorist plot by ISIS supporters to attack a GID facility in the northern city of Irbid with firearms. The three defendants were previously imprisoned for terrorism -related crimes, and the plot originated while the accused were still inside prison. In July, GID disclosed it had stopped a February plot in which four ISIS supporters planned to kill Israeli border guards. The United States has emphasized to the Jordanian government the importance of holding Ahlam al -Tamimi account able in a U.S. court for her admitted role in a 2001 bombing in Jerusalem that included two Americans among the 15 victims. She had been serving a prison sentence in Israel for a terroris m conviction related to the bombing before she was released by Israel as part of a prisoner exchange. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Jordan is a member of MENAFATF, a FATF -style regional body, and a member of the coalition's Counter -ISIS Finance Group. Jordan 's financial intelligence unit, the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Financing Unit, has been a member of the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units since 2012. In October, Jordan was added to the FATF gr ay list, and subsequently committed to strengthening the effect iveness of its AML/CFT regime. The Government of Jordan has taken steps to address concerns identified by FATF, including through the September passage of the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism law. The revised law expanded the p owers of the National Committee for Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, granted the public prosecutor the power to seize assets used in money laundering and terrorism financing crimes, and established an office to manage seized funds and confiscated assets. Countering Violent Extremism: Jordan continued to implement a national strategy on preventing violent extremism (PVE), coordinated by an office in the Prime Ministry. Priority engagement areas include countering violent extremist ideology, building social cohesion among civil society, and assisting law enforcement. Officials regularly engaged experts on topics such as the role of women and girls in terrorism prevention as well as the monitoring and evaluation of PVE programs. Civil society organizations have undertaken work across the country to address root causes of violent extremism and offer positive alternatives to youth through activities that build critical thinking skills, encourage civic participation, increase awareness of online safety, and address the needs of returning terrorist fighters to their families. In September , the Jordanian governme nt hosted a regional conference organized by the Council of Muslim Elders to spread the values of peace and tolerance and confront extremism and hatred. International and Regional Cooperation: Jordan is a major non -NATO ally and a member of the GCTF. Within the GCTF, it co -chairs the Foreign Terrorist Fighters Working Group with the United States . It is a member of the UN, the League of Arab States , Organization for Islamic Cooperation, the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, and the Proliferation Security Initiative. Jordan participated in September's First Global Parliamentary Summit on Counterterrorism, held in Vienna, which stressed the importance of addressin g challenges in the Sahel area that affect stability and security , real solutions for a population that has suffered greatly, and support for the victims of terrorism in the region. In August, Jordanian troops participated in the international military exercise Bright St ar in Egypt along with forces from several other states , including the United States, Britain, France, and the UAE. The exercise aimed to increase cooperation and coordination and strengthen security efforts related to issues of violent extremism and combating terrorism. In December, Jordan hosted an Aqaba Pr ocess meeting in Amman focused on identifying future terrorism threats. The Aqaba Process is a Jordanian initiative started by King Abdullah in 2015 to counter violent extremism. KUWAIT Overview: Kuwait is an active participant in international fora and regularly participates in counterterrorism training. The nation is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and co-leads the Foreign Terrorist Fighters Working Group with T\u00fcrkiye and the Netherlands. Kuwait has begun its Financial Action Task Force mutual evaluation process. However, the planned March onsite assessment was postponed to late 2023 because of the COVID -19 pandemic. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorist incidents reporte d in Kuwait in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement and Border Security: There were no changes to Kuwait's counterterrorism legal framework. Political gridlock in the National Assembly prevented the passage of substantive counterterrorism legislation. In June, more than 100 officials from the Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO), the Ministry of Interior, and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) attended a series of workshops hosted by DOJ OPDAT to strengthen Kuwait's ability to detect and c ombat terrorism financing. In November, more than 70 officials from the PPO and the MOI participated in OPDAT -sponsored training on countering the use of cyberspace and cryptocurrency in terrorism. Private sector groups, including the Kuwaiti bar association and trade groups for the banking and remittance industries, also participated in OPDAT -sponsored training. In September, Kuwait's criminal court sentenced an individual to five years' impri sonment for joining Hizballah and planning to use weapons to commit a hostile act against Lebanon. The prosecutors working on the investigation had received capacity building assistance from the United States. In November, as part of a broader poli tical dialogue, Amir Nawaf Al Sabah commuted the sentences of 20 members, including the leader of the \"Abdali cell,\" convicted in 2016 of charges including storing weapons and explosives and spying for Lebanese Hizballah. The pardons also included four ad ditional persons convicted of harboring Abdali cell members while they fled prosecution. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Kuwait is a member of the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force, the Defeat -ISIS Coalition and its Counter -ISIS Finance Group, and the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center. The Kuwait FIU is a member of the Egmont Group. Kuwait has not updated its AML/CFT law since its passage in 2013. In May, Kuwait advised the public about the risks of virtual assets suc h as Bitcoin, but the government has not yet enacted any regulations to govern the use of cryptocurrency. In November, Kuwait detained 24 persons for allegedly using charitable organizations to raise money for Hizballah, including one individual who had been designated as a terrorist by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in September. The proceedings are ongoing. For much of 2021, Kuwait's FIU was under acting leadership. The FIU continues to have a backlog of reporting on its investigations and pros ecutions data. Kuwaiti prosecutors also dismissed several money laundering investigations for lack of evidence. The FIU is increasing its ability to share information with partner agencies by concluding interagency MOU , including with Kuwait's Central Ba nk in October. Countering Violent Extremism: The Ministry of Interior runs TV and radio programming aimed at audiences believed to be at higher risk of \"radicalization. \" The Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs launched a five -year strategic plan to promote moderation and confront violent extremism. The Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs operates the Kuwait Moderation Center, which sponsors programs designed to prom ote religious tolerance. In October , the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs formed a committee to counter radicalization to violence and violent extremism on the internet and social media. International and Regional Cooperation: Kuwait served as c hair of the Arab League from September to early 2022, is a member of the Governing Board of Administrators of the International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law and remains an active member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS Small Group. Kuwa it continued its historical role as mediator in several regional disputes, most notably mediating the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC )- Lebanon rift. Additionally, Kuwait hosts the headquarters for Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF -OIR). Kuwait is a member of the following international organizations engaged in counterterrorism cooperation: the United Nations , the Arab League , the GCC , the International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law , the Organization of Islamic Cooperation , the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition , and CJTF -OIR. LEBANON Overview: In 2021, the United States provided security assistance and training to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and worked with law enforcement organizations, such as the Internal Security Forces (ISF), to enhance their counterterrorism capabilities and investigate and prosecute local terrorism cases. Terrorist groups operating in Lebanon included U.S. government -designated foreign te rrorist organizations such as Hizballah and ISIS. Hizballah continued armed militia activities in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen in collaboration with the Iranian regime. Lebanon's 12 Palestinian refugee camps remained largely outside the control of Lebanese security forces and posed a security threat because of the potential for militant recruitment and terrorist infiltration. Several individuals on the FBI's most wanted list and the Department of State's Rewards for Justice list reportedly remained in Lebanon. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: The following is a representative list of terrorist incidents in Lebanon: On February 3, civil society activist Lokman Slim was assassinated in southern Lebanon. Many local observers attributed his murder to Hizballah. On May 13, 17, and 19, and on July 20 and August 4, rockets were launched from southern Lebanon toward Israel. The LAF attributed the launches to unspecified Palestinian terrorist groups. On August 6, Hizballah claimed responsibility for lau nching 19 rockets from southern Lebanon toward Israel. On August 22, members of a suspected ISIS cell orchestrated the drive -by motorcycle shooting of a retired LAF officer in Tripoli. In September, the LAF arrested members of a suspected ISIS cell in Tr ipoli accused of having killed the retired LAF officer the previous month. On October 14, members of Hizballah and political party Amal engaged in armed clashes with members of the political group Lebanese Forces, in the Tayyouneh area of Beirut. The LAF deployed to restore order. Seven persons were killed and 32 injured in this incident. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Lebanon does not have a comprehensive counterterrorism law, but several articles of Lebanon's criminal code ar e effectively used to prosecute acts of terrorism. No new laws related to terrorism were passed in 2021. The LAF, the ISF, the Directorate of General Security (DGS), and the General Directorate of State Security were the primary government agencies respo nsible for counterterrorism. Although cooperation among the services was inconsistent, they took steps to improve information sharing. Structural limitations in the justice system remained a barrier to conducting trials on terrorism cases in a timely man ner. Because of delays, some individuals suspected of terrorism were held in pretrial detention for extended periods. The Department of State funded programs to train judges and prosecutors on the skills needed to adjudicate criminal cases, including ter rorism -related cases. The Department also provided virtual courtroom equipment in 23 courtrooms across Lebanon to more effectively and efficiently adjudicate criminal cases. In January, the LAF and ISF arrested demonstrators protesting deteriorating e conomic conditions in Tripoli, who reportedly damaged public properties and attempted to injure security forces. In February, a military court charged 35 of the protesters with terrorism -related crimes, which some civil society groups described as an atte mpt to suppress political dissent. The LAF held primary responsibility for securing Lebanon's land and maritime borders, while DGS and Customs were responsible for official points of entry. The LAF improved its ability to monitor Lebanon's land bord er with Syria through the Land Border Security Project funded by the United States, Canada, and the UK. This project resulted in enhanced border enforcement and an improved ability to interdict terrorist and criminal travel. Lebanon made efforts to impl ement UN Security Council resolutions 2396 and 2309 by collecting biographic data for travelers at Beirut International Airport, Passenger Name Record data for commercial flights, and Advanced Passenger Information. DGS regularly updated INTERPOL watchlis t information at border security terminals at Beirut International Airport. DGS routinely shared information about falsified travel documents with foreign embassies in Lebanon. The ISF neared completion of a Department of State -funded project to increase the ISF's biometric collection and storage capabilities, which will also enable the ISF to share biometric data with other Lebanese security services. In 2021, Lebanese security services coordinated with the United States on numerous instances to investi gate individuals involved in terrorism. LAF and ISF units, including units receiving U.S. capacity building assistance, undertook enforcement actions against suspected terrorists in 2021. In January, the LAF arrested 18 Lebanese and Syrian nationals suspected of being ISIS operatives in the northeastern Arsal region. The presence of Hizballah in the Lebanese government continued to impede effective host government action against terrorist incidents associated with Hizballah. For instance, the ISF and judiciary were accused by Human Rights Watch of failing to fully investigate politically sensitive murder investigations during 2020 and 2021, including the suspected Hizballah assassination of civil society activist Lokman Slim. In addition, despite repeated attempts by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to gain access to areas within its area of responsibility from which Hizballah is suspected to have stored or used weapons, Lebanese authorities in many instances declined to facilitate UNIFIL access to these areas. Some Lebanese security forces personnel may interact with Hizballah as part of official duties but are not beholden to the terrorist group. In domestic and international fora, Lebanese officials argued that acts taken against \"foreign occupation\" are not terrorism. This characterization was used to justify Hizballah's acts against Israel as resistance to occupation rather than as terrorism. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Lebanon is a member of MENA FATF. Its FIU, the Special Investigation Commission (SIC), is a member of the Egmont Group. Lebanon is a member of the Counter -ISIS Finance Group (CIFG) and the working group of the Defeat -ISIS Coalition. In 2021, the SIC received 22 terrorism and te rrorism -financing cases. The SIC reported that there were 203 individuals and 19 entities on Lebanon's national terrorism -financing list as of year-end 2021. Lebanon did not propose any new designations to the UNSCR 1267/2253 Sanctions Committee in 2021. Countering Violent Extremism: Lebanon published its national strategy for PVE in 2018. The National PVE Coordination Unit organized workshops in 2019 to solicit inputs for a PVE National Action Plan (NAP) for implementation of the strategy. Because of COVID -19 and delays in government formation during 2020 -21, the Cabinet has not yet endorsed the NAP. In March, Lebanon's National PVE Coordination Unit launched a \"National Exchange Platform,\" an online portal that facilitates CVE information sharing among civil society groups and government officials in Lebanon. Lebanese municipalities continued to engage in activities organized by the Strong Cities Network. International and Regional Cooperation: Lebanon supported counterterrorism efforts in regional organizations and participated in counterterrorism finance programs. LIBYA Overview: Libyan government officials continued to work with U.S. counterparts to combat terrorism, although fractured security institutions limited direct cooperation. Following the failure of the self -styled Libyan National Army's (LNA 's) military assault on west ern Libya in 2019 -20, UN -facilitated talks selected a new nominally unified interim executive authority, the Government of National Unity (GNU), in March , with a mandate to lead the country to national elections, which were ultimately postponed. Despite t he political uncertainty, terrorist groups such as ISIS and al -Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) have been unable to significantly regroup. While terrorist groups control no territory in Libya and are significantly degraded in terms of numbers and capa city, they remain a threat. Elements of the GNU are reliable and willing U.S. counterterrorism partners, although the GNU's capacity to eliminate terrorist safe havens, counter terrorist financing, deter the flow of FTFs , and ensure effective counterproliferation efforts across Libya's territory was limited. The LNA countered terrorism in the East and South of the country, but its counterterrorism gains were limited to areas under its direct control. 2021 Terrorist In cidents: Significant terrorist incidents in Libya in 2021 included the following: In June, IS IS claimed responsibility for a VBIED suicide attack on a security checkpoint in Sebh . When local police manning the checkpoint stopped and approached the vehicle, the driver reportedly detonated the VBIED, killing himself and two officers. In August , a Sudanese national affiliated with IS IS attempted to conduct a VBIED attack against a security checkpoint manned by the LNA's 128 th Brigade in the town of Zellah in Al Jufra. The LNA claimed it shot the attacker before the VBIED detonated, and there were no other reported causalities. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The GNU retained the Government of National A ccord's CT strategy and its national CT coordinator. In practice, however, under the tenure of the GNU, coordination between relevant authorities still largely occurs on an ad hoc basis, and an implementation plan for the new strategy has yet to be promul gated. Throughout 2021 the GNU conducted CT operations in the country, and the LNA countered terrorism in areas under its control. Libya did not pass or implement any counterterrorism legislation in 2021. Libya lacks a comprehensive counterterrorism law, although the Libyan penal code (under Title 2, Section 1, Chapter 1, Article 170 , and Title 2, Chapter 2, Article 207) criminalizes offenses that may threaten national security, including terrorism, the promotion of terrorist acts, an d the handling of money in support of such acts. Libya has ratified the African Union's (AU 's) Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism, which requires states to criminalize terrorist acts under their national laws. The GNU continued to seek international support to combat ISIS-Libya and AQIM. Despite Libya's disjointed security institutions and ongoing political strife, the GNU undertook operations to disrupt terrorist groups. In September , the GNU announced th e arrest of senior ISIS leader Mubarak al -Kharmi along with two other militants in the western city of Bani Walid. That same month, LNA forces captured suspected ISIS member Ali al -Ajili al -Hasnawi in Brak al -Shati. Countering the Financing of Terror ism: Libya is a member of MENAFATF. Libya is also a member of the Defeat -ISIS CIFG. In November , the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) participated in a detailed gap analysis of the Libyan Anti -Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Law No. 1013 of 2017 and identified numerous strategic weaknesses. The CBL also contributed to the development of a regulatory framework to help ensure better compliance with international standards and applicable regulations governing anti -money laundering and counter financing of terrorism. In December , the CBL initiated the development of a set of instructions for banks and financial institutions that offer accounts to nonprofit organizations. The instructions aim to expand the awareness and capacity of these banks and in stitutions regarding tracking and reporting on possible money laundering and terrorist financing activities. Countering Violent Extremism: There were no changes in 2021. International and Regional Cooperation: The European Union and the UK continued working to support the development of the Libyan National CT Strategy under the CT Coordinator. Libya is a member of the United Nations, the AU, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the Arab League. MOROCCO Overview: The United States and Morocco have a long history of strong CT cooperation. The Government of Morocco continued its comprehensive strategy that includes vigilant security measures, regional and international cooperation, and counter radicalization policies. In 2021, Morocco continued to mitigate the risk of terrorism. The country continued to face sporadic threats from small, independent terrorist cells, the majority of w hich claimed to be inspired by or affiliated with ISIS. Morocco is a member of the GCTF, which it co -chairs with Canada. Morocco is also a member of the Defeat -ISIS Coalition's Counter -ISIS Countering Violent Extremism Working Group and co -chairs the Afri ca Focus Group within the Coalition . 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorist incidents reported in Morocco in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Morocco investigates, prosecutes, and sentences defendants under CT legislation enacted in 2003 and expanded in 2015, and which is in line with UN Security Council resolution 2178. In 2021, Moroccan law enforcement , coordinated by the Ministry of Interi or, targeted and arrested at least 55 individuals in 11 CT operations, effectively dismantling cells in the early stages of planning attacks against a range of targets, including public buildings, prominent figures, government security service buildings, a nd, as reported in local press, foreigners. The number of arrests in 2021 was lower than the number of arrests made in the years before the COVID -19 pandemic. Moroccan law enforcement leveraged intelligence collection, police work, and collaboration with international partners to conduct counterterrorism operations. The Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) remains the primary law enforcement agency responsible for counterterrorism prosecutions. The BCIJ reports to the General Directorate for Territorial Surveillance (DGST) and operates under the supervision of the public prosecutor of the Court of Appeals. The following offers a snapshot of arrests in 2021: In March , the DGST arrested a 38 -year-old male in Meknes. The suspect, a suspend ed police officer since 2015, also faced charges of extremist indoctrination of his children. The Moroccan authorities seized an ISIS flag, a knife, and a mobile phone. In June , the DGST dismantled a six -member cell that was planning terrorist attacks in Sal\u00e9. Cell members ranged from 23 to 39 years old and were orchestrating motorcycle accidents to collect insurance claims to finance terrorist operations. The DGST seized a motorcycle and medical documentation with the names of the suspects, records of the staged traffic accidents, digital data, and \"extremist\" literature, in addition to drugs. In December , the DGST arrested 25 ISIS suspects affiliated with ISIS . The suspects planned terrorist attacks across Morocco against public targets and security services headquarters. The Moroccan authorities reportedly seized firearms, ammunition, knives, IED instructional documents, and ISIS literature. Moroccan law enforcement agenci es participated in a wide range of U.S. -sponsored programs to improve the country's technical and investigative capabilities, including financial investigation, intelligence analysis, forensics, and cybersecurity. Border security remained a top priority for Moroccan authorities. The General Directorate for National Security has primary responsibility for conducting border inspections at ports of entry such as Casablanca's Mohammed V Airport. Law enforcement officials and private airline carriers worked regularly with the United States to detect and deter individuals attempting to transit illegally and to address watchlisted travelers. Moroccan airport authorities have excellent capabilities in detecting fraudulent documents. In addition, police, custo ms officers, and the Royal Gendarmerie operated mobile and fixed checkpoints along the roads in border areas and at the entrances to major municipalities. Moroccan naval and coast guard units monitored and patrolled Morocco's extensive coastal waters, inc luding the Strait of Gibraltar, to interdict illicit traffickers. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Morocco is a member of MENAFATF. The National Financial Intelligence Authority (FIU) is a member of the Egmont Group. In 2021, Morocco enacted st ricter anti -money laundering legislation, in line with FATF standards, in response to a 2019 MENAFATF Mutual Evaluation Report that placed Morocco on increased monitoring status for money laundering. Countering Violent Extremism: Morocco has a comprehensive CVE strategy that prioritizes economic and human development in addition to countering radicalization to violence and \"ove rsight of the religious sphere.\" To counter what it views as religious extremism, Morocco promotes an interpretation of the Maliki -Ashari school of Sunni Islam. The Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs has developed an educational curriculum for Mo rocco's nearly 50,000 imams as well as for female Islamic guides ( mourchidates ). Morocco's imam training center in Rabat trains imams mostly from West Africa. The Royal Mohammedan League of Ulema (Rabita Mohammedia) counters \"radicalization\" by producing scholarly research, reviewing educational curricula, and conducting youth outreac h on religious and social topics. The Department of State has supported the General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration's (DGAPR 's) efforts to modernize prison management, develop prisoner classification tools, control disturbances, modify inmate behavior, and construct more secure facilities. The DGAPR, in cooperation with other ministries, conducted several trainings of its deradicalization program, Moussalaha (Reconciliation) , for both women and men. International and Regional Cooperation: Morocco is a co -chair of the GCTF with Canada and is a member of the D-ISIS Coalition and the Trans -Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership. A major non -NATO ally, in 2021 Morocco hosted A frican Lion, AFRICOM's (U.S. Africa Command 's) largest and most complex military exercise, which includes specialized training for CT -related units. Additionally, the United Nations Office of Counterterrorism (UNOCT) established a UNOCT Program Office in Morocco for Specialized Counterterrorism an d Law Enforcement Training in Africa; it opened in June and hosted several training courses in late 2021. Morocco also enjoys strong cooperation with European partners \u2014 particularly Belgium, France, and the Netherlands \u2014 to thwart potential terrorist threats in Europe. OMAN Overview: Oman is an important regional counterterrorism partner. The nation remains concerned about the conflict in Yemen and the potential for AQAP and ISIS -Yemen to threaten Oman's land and m aritime borders. Omani and U.S. officials regularly engaged on efforts to counter violent extremism and terrorism. Oman sought training and equipment from the U.S. government, other countries, and commercial entities to support its efforts to control its land, air, and maritime borders. The country welcomed U.S. security assistance to improve its crisis management capacity, as well as its counterterrorism tactics and procedures; however, some counterterrorism training and exercises were postponed or canc eled because of the COVID -19 pandemic. Oman issued statements condemning terrorist attacks around the world in 2021. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in Oman in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There were no changes to Oman's counterterrorism legislation in 2021. Local capacity and a challenging operating environment owing to Oman's extensive coastline and long, remote borders with Saudi Arabi a and Yemen remain obstacles for counterterrorism investigations, crisis response, and border security capabilities. Nevertheless, Oman had sufficient communication and coordination among its many counterterrorism -related agencies and National Security Co uncil. The Sultan's Special Forces and the Royal Oman Police (ROP) Special Task Force are Oman's primary tactical counterterrorism response forces. The Royal Office Liaison and Coordination Service, the Internal Security Service, and ROP's Special Branch play key roles in securing Oman from terrorist threats. Omani authorities have developed specific plans to prevent or respond to terrorist attacks against soft targets. Oman recognizes the need to improve its counterterrorism capabilities and the value of U.S. counterterrorism and law enforcement training and assistance. The Antiterrorism Assistance (ATA) program targeted skills related to crisis management and advanced counterterrorism operations and response. Omani officials from the ROP and other a gencies participated in ATA training. The ROP Coast Guard, ROP Customs, the Maritime Security Center, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Royal Office participated in several training activities through the Department of State's Export Control and R elated Border Security (EXBS) program. EXBS programming supported the government's efforts to build its capacity to interdict weapons and conduct investigations at airports and seaports. EXBS programming also increased Omani officials' understanding of U N sanctions implementation through virtual webinars and tabletop exercises. The major impediments to effective law enforcement and border security in Oman remained limited resources, challenges with Omani interagency coordination, and the need for conti nued training to develop advanced law enforcement skills. The rugged mountainous terrain along Oman's border with Yemen presents an additional challenge. Oman continued to seek opportunities for additional U.S. border security training. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Oman is preparing for an upcoming Financial Action Task Force Mutual Evaluation . Oman is a member of MENAFATF , and its Financial Information Processing Unit is a member of the Egmont Group. The nation also is a member of the Riyadh -based Terrorist Financing Targeting Center (TFTC). Oman continued to participate in TFTC capacity building workshops and expressed support f or continued joint sanctions. Oman has taken steps to enhance the efficiency of the National Center for Financial Information (NCFI, its financial intelligence unit) to analyze and respond to suspicious activity reports related to AML/CFT, such as an MO U between the Central Bank of Oman and NCFI to enhance information -sharing mechanisms. Countering Violent Extremism: The full nature and scope of Oman's CVE initiatives remained opaque in 2021, but engagement with the Omani government suggests that Oma n continued to counter terrorist recruitment through unpublicized initiatives. There were no reports of foreign government or foreign non -governmental support for religious schools, mosques, or other organizations that may be conducive to the spread of violent extremism. International and Regional Cooperation: Oman is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, the Saudi -led Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition, and TFTC. Oman regularly votes in favor of counterterrorism measures in the UN General Assembly, the Arab League, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. QATAR Overview: The United States and Qatar continued to increase counterterrorism cooperation, building on progress made after the U.S. Secretary of State and Qatari foreign minister signed a counterterrorism MOU in 2017. During the November U.S. -Qatar Strategic Dialogue's Counterterrorism Session, the two governments reviewed the significant progress made on counterterrorism cooperation and committed to maintaining ongoing momentum for 2022. Qatar is an active participant in th e Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and all the Defeat -ISIS working groups. Qatar facilitated U.S. military operations in the region and hosts roughly 8,000 U.S. service members at military installations critical to Defeat -ISIS efforts. 2021 Terrorist Inc idents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in Qatar in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There were no significant changes in counterterrorism legislation. Qatar maintains an interagency National Counterterrorism Comm ittee (NCTC) with representatives from more than 10 government agencies. The NCTC formulates Qatar's counterterrorism policy, ensuring interagency coordination, fulfilling Qatar's counterterrorism - related obligations under international conventions, and p articipating in multilateral conferences on terrorism. U.S. officials regularly met with the NCTC chairman to discuss overall counterterrorism cooperation. The Qatar State Security Bureau (SSB) maintained an aggressive posture toward monitoring internal terrorism -related activities. The Ministry of Interior and the Internal Security Force (ISF) continue to participate in structured counterterrorism training and exercises, including with U.S. agencies. Qatar and DHS signed an agreement and a memorandum of cooperation in 2021 bolstering the ability to share certain biometric and visa data. The United States and Qatar continued to partner on terrorist screening and aviation security. Ministry of Interior authorities cooperate with officials from the U.S . Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection, Transportation Security Administration, and Homeland Security Investigations to screen the near 40 million travelers who transit Hamad International Airport annually. U.S. technical assis tance to Qatari law enforcement and judicial agencies increased during 2021. The U.S. Departments of Justice (DOJ), State, and the Treasury, as well as the FBI, led or participated in several capacity building initiatives involving the Ministry of Interio r, the ISF, the SSB, the Public Prosecution, the Central Bank, and other Qatari agencies. A DOJ resident legal adviser has been stationed in Qatar since 2018, providing technical assistance to Qatar's counterterrorism efforts and building prosecutorial ca pacity. U.S. Central Command and Embassy Doha coordinated multiple virtual planning conferences with their Qatar counterparts from the Ministry of Interior , the ISF, and Qatar Joint Special Forces, for Invincible Sentry 21 (IS -21), a bilateral counterter rorism exercise that took place March 21 -26 in Doha. The exercise tested Qatar's tactical capabilities, command, control, coordination, and decision making within and between governments, agencies, and ministries in preparation for the 2022 FIFA Men's World Cup. The U.S. interagency Foreign Emergency Support Team also participated in this bilateral Department of Defense Combatant Command exercise. Additionally, Qatari explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) personnel trained with Diplomatic Security' s electronic countermeasure instructors and U.S. Air Force EOD personnel from Al Udeid Air Base to enhance commercial electronic countermeasure capabilities, explosive identification, and post -blast investigations. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Qatar is a member of MENAFATF. Qatar's FIU is a member of the Egmont Group. Qatar is also a member of the Defeat -ISIS Coalition Counter - ISIS Financing Working Group and the Riyadh -based Terrorist Financing Targeting Center (TFTC). In colla boration with other TFTC member states, Qatar in July sanctioned six individuals and entities affiliated with ISIS terror -support networks in the region. In September, Qatar took coordinated action \u2014 with the United States \u2014 against a major Hizballah financial network based in the Persian Gulf region, designating, under its updated AML/CFT regime, seven individuals and one entity for their role in the financing of terrorism. This represents one of the most significant joint actions the United States has taken with a Gulf Cooperation Council partner to date. Qatar continued to maintain restrictions, imposed in 2017, on the overseas activities of Qatari charities, requiring all such activity to be conducted through one of fou r approved charities \u2014 to protect charitable giving from terrorist financing abuse. Countering Violent Extremism: Qatar's primary CVE strategy remained investment in education, sports diplomacy, and increasing economic opportunities for youth around th e globe, largely through the Qatar Foundation and related organizations, such as Silatech and Education Above All. Since 2020 , Qatar has hosted UNOCT's first International Hub on Behavioral Insights to Counterterrorism in the Middle East and North Africa, to better understand the underlying roots of violent extremism and determine the best use of sports as a CVE tool. Qatar has made strides in addressing state -sourced internal support for educational and religious content espousing intolerance, discrimina tion, sectarianism, and violence, although examples can still be found in textbooks and disseminated through satellite television and other media. Qatar was a major funder of the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund (GCERF) and sits on its Go verning Board of Directors. The Qatar Fund for Development supported GCERF's efforts to build awareness among community leaders about the impact of terrorist radicalization and recruitment, to share information on how to respond to terrorism, to promote peace through community engagement activities, and to provide educational initiatives. Qatar's Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE) supported English -language programming in MEHE schools to counter terrorist influence and messaging. The MEHE undersecretary, who also serves as chairman of the semigovernmental Doha International Center for Interfaith Dialogue, requested recommendations from the Department of State's Office of International Religious Freedom on educational consultants or Fulbright scholars to assist with further revisions of Qatar's Islamic studies public school te xtbooks to increase understanding of religious pluralism and tolerance. International and Regional Cooperation: Qatar is an active participant in the UN, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the Arab League. Qatar also is a member of the GCTF and the TFTC. Qatar was reincorporated into GCC activities in January, following a three -and-a-half-year pause owing to the 2017 to 2021 Persian Gulf rift between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt. Since June, Qa tar has hosted the UNOCT Program Office on Parliamentary Engagement, which seeks to strengthen the contributions, coordination, and capacity of parliaments at national, regional, and global level s to enhance international efforts against terrorism. SAUDI ARABIA Overview: In 2021 , the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia continued to work closely with U.S. and international counterparts to deploy a comprehensive and well -resourced counterterrorism strategy that included security measures, threat detection and d eterrence, measures to counter terrorist financing, and counter -radicalization efforts. The leading terrorist threat was Houthi cross -border attacks, some of which the United States has described as terrorism, which more than doubled in 2021. As in previ ous years, Saudi Arabia was a full partner and active participant in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and provided significant operational and logistical support to Coalition activities. Terrorist Incidents: Houthi cross -border attacks , some of whic h the United States has described as terrorism, surpassed 400 in 2021, more than double the number of attacks in 2020. Incidents included the use of ballistic and cruise missiles, unmanned aerial systems, unmanned surface vessels, and floating mines. Significant cross -border incidents in 2021 include d the following : On February 10, shrapnel from a Houthi attack on Abha International A irport caused a fire on a civilian aircraft and injured 12 people. On March 2 , a Houthi drone attack against Jizan injured five civilians and caused damage to several buildings. On August 30 a Houthi drone attack on Abha airport wounded eight civilians and damaged the airport and a commercial airliner. On September 4 a Houthi compl ex drone and missile attack in the Eastern Province resulted in injuries to two children and damage to 14 private residences. On October 8 a Houthi drone injured 10 civilians after it struck a commercial airport in Jizan. On March 30, a man was arrested at Masjid al -Haram, the Gr eat Mosque of Mecca , after brandishing a weapon and shouting terrorist slogans. No injuries were reported. Separately, French prosecutors announced that they were investigating a December 30 vehic le explosion in Jeddah as a possible terrorist attack. The incident damaged an automobile associated with the Dakar Rally auto race and injured one civilian, a French national, according to press reports. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Secur ity: Comprehensive counterterrorism legislation has been in place since 2017, and no changes were made in 2021. Saudi Arabia was committed to securing its borders and denying safe haven to terrorists. The Ministry of Interior monitored passenger manifes ts for inbound and outbound flights and issued travel documents with security technology, advance passenger name record information, and biometric screening capabilities at ports of entry. The Saudi government continued to partner with the United States t hrough Saudi -funded and U.S.-implemented programs that, among other objectives, sought to improve the country's counterterrorism capacities. Projects included training to protect critical infrastructure sites such as maritime ports, aviation assets, energ y infrastructure, and desalination plants from terrorist threats. Saudi Arabia also participated in multilateral engagements with Persian Gulf state counterparts, including joint counterterrorism operations in Yemen. The counterterrorism law's definition of terrorism drew criticism from local human rights activists, international human rights organizations, and the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism for its overly broad and vague definitions of terrorism, which has been used by the government to prosecute political dissidents, women's rights activists, and members of minority faiths. In October , the Specialized Criminal Court of Appeals upheld the six-year prison sentence of women's rights activ ist Mohammed al -Rabea. In April , the court sentenced al -Rabea under the country's counterterrorism law to six years' imprisonment, with credit for time served, and a travel ban. Detained in 2018, al -Rabea's arrest was also tied to his activism for women' s right to drive and against the guardianship syste m. Human rights groups reported a uthorities used the cybercrimes law and the counterterrorism law both to monitor terrorist and extremist discourse on social media as well as to restrict freedom of expres sion, including by prosecuting numerous individuals under these laws on charges related to statements made on social media. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Saudi Arabia remained a regional leader in countering terrorist financing, hosting the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center that brings together the United States and Gulf partners to confront new and evolving networks and lead efforts on anti -money laundering and counterterrorist financing measures. Saudi Arabia is an active member of FATF and completed a Virtual Asset/Virtual Asset Service Provider risk assessment, in line with FATF recommendations, which will serve as the basis for a national action plan focused on the mitigation of money laundering and terrorist finance risks. Saudi Arabia streamlined its process to restrict financing to individuals and entities listed by the UN Security Council and completed an assessment to evaluate its compliance with UN resolutions. It imposed sanctions against individuals and entities asso ciated with an international network funding the Houthis. Countering Violent Extremism: Saudi Arabia had numerous government and government - affiliated entities devoted to CVE, including the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology (Etidal), the Intellectual Warfare Center, and various entities within universities and the military and security services. Major CVE organizations focused on refuting extremist ideology through scholarly interpretation of the Quran. Etidal touted the signing of a n MO U with the UN Counterterrorism Center (UNCCT) in April, and Saudi Arabia continued to be the UNCCT's largest donor. Saudi Arabia continued its flagship program at the Mohammed bin Nayef Center for Counseling and Care, which seeks to deradicalize form er terrorists and facilitate their reentry into society. The Muslim World League promoted a message of tolerance and focused efforts on acceptance of other faiths. On August 30 , the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Call, and Guidance issued circulars to e very Saudi mosque that included a directive to remove extremist literature and a prohibition on proselytizing. In contrast, anti semitic language was used in several Friday sermons at the Two Holy Mosques in Mecca and Medina. The Saudi government made further progress in revising textbooks used in the public K -12 curriculum to reduce \"intolerant and extremist\" content. International and Regional Cooperation: Saudi Arabia is a member of the following organizations engaged in CT cooperation: G-20 GCTF Gulf Cooperation Council Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition Organization of Islamic Cooperation UN Counterterrorism Center TUNISIA Overview: Counterterrorism and border security continued to be a top priority of the Government of Tunisia in 2021. The risk of terrorist activity remained high, exacerbated by sustained instability in neighboring Libya , although the frequency and scale of terrorist attacks conducted in 2021 decreased. Tunisia's continued work to profe ssionalize its security apparatus in partnership with the United States and its commitment to conduct joint M inistry of Interior and M inistry of Defense CT operations have steadily degraded violent extremist organization capacity within the country. Despi te COVID -19 challenges affecting national resources, Tunisia demonstrated consistent security force readiness and carried out proactive CT operations throughout the year. Tunisia continued work on implementation of a national preventing/countering violent extremism strategy and the freezing of terrorist assets, and demonstrated improvements in CT crisis response, coordination, and investigation. Terrorist Incidents: On March 11 , the Ministry of Defense reported that an IED explosion near Mount Salloum in the governorate of Kasserine killed two children, ages 7 and 9, and injured their mother. On November 26, police shot and wounded a violent extremist who attacked the Ministry of Interior headquarters in Tunis using a knife and a cleaver. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Overall, the government's CT efforts continue to demonstrate advances in successful, proactive CT operations and improved coordination between Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defense security elements. There is substantive cooperation with Embassy Tunis on investigations, prosecutions, and prevention of terrorist activity aimed at U.S. interests in Tunisia. The Tunisian National Counterterrorism Commission ( CNLCT) worked on revising the National Counterterrorism Strategy through a consultative process with ministries and civil society organization stakeholders. The next five -year plan, which will be completed in summer 2022, strives to be a holistic, whole -of-government and society approach for CVE. Tunisia has specific capabilities to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks against soft targets, such as hotels, stadi a, tourist resorts, and cultural sites, in line with UNSCR 2341 on protecting critical infrastructure from terrorist attacks. Safeguarding tourist zones remained a government focus, with work continuing in the context of the G7+7 Tourist and Cultural Sites Protection project group. The number of tourists travelling to Tunisia was reduced by more than 70 percent because of COVID -19. Border security remained a top government priority in 2021 because of continued instability in Libya. The Tunisian Armed Fo rces, along with the Ministry of Interior 's National Guard, successfully employed U.S. -funded patrol craft, vehicles, and weapons in joint operations throughout 2021. Phase 2 of the southern electronic border surveillance system was completed in 2021. The maritime coastal surveillance system continued to provide full coverage along the entire Tunisian coast. As part of interdiction and border security support efforts , the United States has provided training in advanced travel document examination. The government has limited prosecutorial, prison, and social services capacity for rehabilitation and reintegration efforts. Significant CT -related law enforcement actions against terrorists and terrorist groups included the following : In April, authorities reported they dismantled an ISIS affiliated terror group in Sfax, disrupting an imminent terror attack in the process. Authorities reportedly seized significant amounts of raw materials for making explosives and electronic devices. In April, authorities conducted an operation against Ajnad al -Khilafah ( the Army of the Caliphate , affiliated with ISIS), eliminating known terrorists and seizing weapons. In January, authorities arrested the leader and members of a terrorist cell affiliated with the Okba Ibn Nafaa group. Tunisian police, the N ational Guard, and the military continued to benefit from U.S. -provided capacity building assistance including training focused on interagency cooperation and investigative and tactical skills; embedded men tors within the National Guard and National Police antiterrorism units; and train -the-trainer courses. Additional assistance included funding for a National Guard Operations room and renovation of CT judicial facilities. The government continues to cooperate with U.S. law enforcement authorities to prevent further acts of terrorism against U.S. citizens or interests in Tunisia. However, owing to internal government bureaucracy, broader cooperation at times remained chal lenging and inefficient. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: The CNLCT in December froze the funds and assets of six Tunisians suspected of links to terrorist crimes. As of December 31, Tunisia had designated 142 individuals, organizations, and/or entities as having links to terror groups, freezing their assets as part of that designation. U.S. efforts to support counterterrorism finance investigations included trainings to identify potential misuse of cryptocurrencies. The United States also spo nsored Tunisian government participation in the November regional MENA Money Laundering Conference in Bahrain that focused on regulatory expectations and compliance. Tunisia launched the online platform Hannibal in January , which increased information sharing on hard currency transfers in real time to improve cooperation between law enforcement and the private sector. Countering Violent Extremism: Tunisia remained committed to preventing radicalization through youth and educational programs coordinated among its ministries and civil society organizations. In October , the U.S. Agency for International Development launched the MA3AN program , a 5-year, $48 million resilience and community empowerment program focus ed on preventing violent extremism at the community and national level. Tunisia's ability to reintegrate Tunisians from foreign conflict zones remains limited. The Ministry of Family and Women's Affairs in collaboration with United Nations High Commissio ner for Refugees held two workshops in June and December focused on CVE and repatriation of FTFs and associated women and children. International and Regional Cooperation: Tunisia held a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2020 -21. Tunisia is a board member for the International Institute of Justice and Rule of Law, participated in Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS events, and is a recipient country for CVE assistance from the Global Community Engagement and Resiliency Fund. UNITED ARAB EMIRATES Overview: The United Arab Emirates (UAE) advanced counterterrorism efforts in 2021, particularly in countering terrorist financing and in the international cooperation domain. The UAE's Central Bank (CBUAE) imposed financial sancti ons on several exchange houses operating in the UAE, and the cabinet added 38 individuals and 15 entities to the UAE's terrorist list. U.S. and UAE security agencies signed an information -sharing memorandum of cooperation to facilitate lawful internationa l travel. The UAE remains a leader in countering violent extremist narratives on a global level, supporting CVE education and participating in and hosting international fora to promote tolerance and coexistence. The UAE continued valuable support for cou nterterrorism efforts as a member of the Defeat -ISIS Coalition and in Yemen against al -Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula, including support to local forces in counterterrorism operations. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in the UAE in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: In April , the UAE passed a law regulating donations and fundraising activities for charities with the stated aim to protect organizations from the risk of exploitation by terrorist organizations. The State Security Directorate (SSD) in Abu Dhabi and Dubai State Security (DSS) remained primarily responsible for counterterrorism law enforcement efforts. Local, emirate -level police forces, especially Abu Dhabi Police and Dubai Police, were the first responders in such cases and provided technical assistance to SSD and DSS. The UAE security apparatus demonstrated capability in investigations, crisis response, and border security, and forces were trained and equipped to detect, deter, and respond to terrorist incidents. As in previous years, the UAE worked close ly with the United States, through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to improve its border security posture. Information sharing between Abu Dhabi Police's Criminal Investigations Division and DHS Homeland Security Investigations helped coun ter transnational criminal organizations and terrorist groups. In January , the United States and the UAE signed a memorandum of cooperation that demonstrated a shared commitment to facilitating lawful international travel. The UAE's border security effor ts have increased to further deter terrorist travel by enhancing travel document security; increasing the use of terrorist screening watchlists, including INTERPOL databases; expanding information sharing within the UAE government and with other countries; and institutionalizing the collection of passenger information on commercial flights. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: The UAE is a member of MENAFATF , and i ts FIU is a member of the Egmont Group. The UAE is also a member of the Defeat -ISIS Finan ce Group and the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center. The United States and others recognized progress the UAE has made to strengthen its domestic AML/CFT regime over the past two years. There was a noticeable increase in public announcements of enfo rcement actions taken against banks, exchange houses, and law firms. The UAE became the first GCC country to launch goAML, an AML reporting platform developed by the United Nations for FIUs to collect suspicious transaction reports. The UAE launched a ne w AML Public -Private -Partnership Committee in late 2021, including representatives from the Ministry of Economy, CBUAE, the Ministry of Justice, the Dubai International Financial Center, and the Abu Dhabi Global Market. The government created a permanent executive office for AML/CFT in February to support the UAE's AML/CFT National Strategy. Following the CBUAE introduction in 2020 of a mandatory registration framework for informal money tran sfer operators known as hawala brokers, CBUAE registered more than 50 licensed hawala brokers and referred more than 20 unregistered hawala brokers to law enforcement agencies for investigation. In December, CBUAE imposed fines on six of the brokers under the Countering the Financing of Terrorism ( CFT) regulations for failure to register on goAML. The CBUAE published several guidance documents throughout 2021 covering topics including targeted financial sanctions, reporting requirements for licensed finan cial institutions (LFIs), AML/CFT guidance for exchange houses, and guidance for LFIs that provide services to cash - intensive businesses and to the precious metals and stones sector. The UAE's FIU signed more than 60 MOUs to enhance international cooperat ion and information sharing on AML/CFT issues. The UAE updated its domestic terrorist sanctions list in September to add 38 individuals and 15 entities. These included T\u00fcrkiye -based ISIS financial facilitator Alaa Khanfurah , whom the United States designated in May, as well as the Yemen -based al -Omgy Money Exchange, which the United States designated in 2016. In addition, the list included Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps -Quds Force and Hizballah facilitators and added six Nigerian nationals for financing Boko Haram. Countering Violent Extremism: The UAE government continued to play a leadership role in global efforts to counter terrorist radicalization and recruitment. The UAE hosts the Sawab Center, a bilateral partn ership with the United States that counters ISIS messaging online, and continued to support Hedayah , an international center of excellence for countering violent extremism based in Abu Dhabi. With coordination and support from U.S. Embassy Abu Dhabi, Sawa b collaborated with international and multilateral partners to counter online propaganda by ISIS and ISIS -affiliated organizations. Hedayah carried out CVE programs and research projects around the world, including a U.S. Department of State -supported cou ntermessaging effort for religious and community leaders in Tunisia. International and Regional Cooperation: The UAE led or was actively engaged in a range of counterterrorism cooperation efforts within international, multilateral, and regional organi zations and groupings that align with U.S. and like -minded policy priorities. Relevant UAE engagements are highlighted below: Senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials met with European External Action Service counterparts in March to discuss security and counterterrorism cooperation, including continued AML/CFT coordination. The UAE's AML/CFT Executive Office hosted a team from the General Secretariat of the GCC in September to develop joint action programs among the GCC countries to combat t errorist financing. The UAE is a member of the GCTF and participated in the 11 th GCTF Ministerial Plenary Meeting and the 19 th GCTF Coordinating Committee Meeting in October. The UAE participated in the MENAFATF Plenary and Working Group sessions, held in Cairo in November. YEMEN Overview: Al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), ISIS -Yemen, and Iranian and Iran - backed terrorist groups such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps -Qods Force (IRGC -QF) and Hizballah exploited the political and security vacuum created by conflict between the internationally recognized Republic of Yemen government and the Houthis, as well as conflict between the government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC). Additionally, IRGC -QF exploited the conflict to expand Iran's influence and enable Houthi cross -border terrorist attacks against Saudi Arabia. UN reporting has highlighted connections between IRGC -QF and the Houthis, including the provision of lethal aid used to undertake attacks against infrastructure in Saudi Arabia impacting civilians. The Republic of Yemen government controlled roughly two thirds of the country's territory, although Houthi -controlled areas contained 70 percent to 80 percent of the population, including the capital, Sana'a. Implementation of the 2019 Riyadh Agreement, which called for a power -sharing agreement between the go vernment and the STC , was incomplete and failed to eliminate tensions in the South, where AQAP turned for safe haven following Houthi gains in al-Bayda governorate . The Republic of Yemen government cooperated with the U.S. government on counterterrorism efforts but could not fully enforce CT measures or reliably undertake operations across the country because of instability, violence, and degraded capabilities. A security vacuum persisted, which provided AQAP room to operate. In territory controlled by the government and government -aligned forces, there were instances in which counterterrorism charges were used as a pretense to detain independent journalists (especially female journalists) who published articles critical of local authorities. Security B elt Forces affiliated with the STC and UAE continued to play an important role in CT efforts, as they exercised control over significant parts of Aden and Abyan; however, they have also been accused of human rights abuses , including in detention facilities they operate. ISIS-Yemen has been severely degraded , and many affiliates likely have reintegrated into local militias. AQAP remained active in central Yemen, most notably in al -Bayda. When the Houthis pushed into al -Bayda, AQAP scattered to neighboring Abyan and Shabwah governorates. In November, AQAP leader Khaled Batarfi posted a video justifying reduced activity in Yemen as an opportunity to recruit and leave AQAP's foes to weaken one other. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: Attacks attributed to AQAP decreased in 2021 , compared with 2020. Methods included sniper fire, VBIEDs, ambushes, armed clashes, kidnappings, and targeted assassinations. Notable terrorist incidents included the following: In March, AQAP -affiliated gunmen killed eight soldiers a nd four civilians in an attack on a checkpoint controlled by Security Belt Forces in the Ahwar district of Abyan. The UN Panel of Experts reported that AQAP kidnapped five government officials in Shabwah on June 14, whom they later released on July 5. In November, AQAP claimed several attacks in al -Bayda. Houthi cross -border attacks, some of which the United States has described as terrorism, are addressed in the Saudi Arabia section. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Yemen made no significant changes to its CT legal framework in 2021. Yemen does not have comprehensive counterterrorism legislation. Draft counterterrorism legislation has been pending in Parliament since 2008. Before the outbreak of the conflict, the draft was und er parliamentary review. The law would facilitate the detention of suspects and include mandatory sentencing for several terrorism -related crimes. There have been no clear moves to implement legal structures compliant with UNSCRs 2178 and 2396 related to countering foreign terrorist fighters and terrorist travel, although the Republic of Yemen government continues to institute some measures to combat terrorist travel. There are limited commercial flights operating out of airports in Yemen, and the govern ment does not have the capacity or resources to implement UNSCR 2309 mandates on aviation security. Before 2015, Yemen's National Security Agency and the President's Office drafted a National Counterterrorism Strategy. A ministerial committee reviewed the draft but was unable to finalize it because of political instability. Thus, Yemen's National Counterterrorism Strategy had not been officially adopted or implemented by the end of 2021. Yemen employed the U.S. -provided Personal Identificat ion Secure Comparison and Evaluation System (PISCES ) integrated border security management system, which was being expanded and upgraded at year's end. Yemen, with the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the UK participated in the Yemen Security Working G roup, which included military and diplomatic representatives and developed cooperative capacity -building initiatives for Yemeni military and security forces. The Department of State -funded training on operational border security management, air cargo control and strategic trade enforcement, vehicle interdiction, and cross -border infectious disease management. The Yemeni Coast Guard assisted in interdicting weapons and illegal materials destined for terrorist groups. They took custody of detained crews in at-sea transfers from stateless smuggling vessels interdicted by the U.S. Navy. Yemen's maritime borders remained porous and vulnerable to maritime smuggling of fighters, weapons, and other material used to support AQAP and ISIS -Yemen. Countering th e Financing of Terrorism: Yemen is a member of MENAFATF. The Republic of Yemen Government -controlled Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) in Aden continued incremental efforts to implement IMF Diagnostic Report recommendations to enhance AML/CFT capacity. The government was unable to full y implement FATF and IMF recommendations and UNSCRs related to terrorist financing because of the lack of judicial capacity and ability to exercise power throughout Yemen's territory. Since 2010, FATF has identified Yemen as a risk to the international fi nancial system because of its AML/CFT deficiencies. The number of commercial banks that comply with providing AML/CFT transaction information increased despite Houthi pressure. In December , the president appointed a new CBY board and Governor who has emp hasized improving Yemen's AML/CFT capabilities. Countering Violent Extremism: There were no significant changes in 2021. The UN Panel of Experts on Yemen reported that Houthi summer camps for children provided basic military training and encouraged ha te speech and violence. The Saudi Arabia King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center Child Soldiers Rehabilitation Program in Yemen launched in 2017 was suspended in 2020 because of COVID -19 and evaluated in 2021 for relaunch in 2022. International and Regional Cooperation: The Republic of Yemen government continued to cooperate with the UN Special Envoy for Yemen, the GCC, the United States, and other countries in pursuit of a political solution to the conflict. Yemen is a member of the Organizati on of Islamic Cooperation and the Arab League. SOUTH AND CENTRAL ASIA Overview South and Central Asia in 2021 saw, in addition to continued terrorist activity in Afghanistan and Pakistan, a volatile mix of insurgent attacks punctuated by incidents of terrorism in the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and threats by the Islamic State's Khorasan Province (ISIS -K) against Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Al-Qa'ida and its regional affiliate in the Indian subcontinent, AQIS, kept a low profile in accordance with Taliban directives. Following the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan, ISIS -K, elements of AQ, and regionally focused terrorist groups maintained a presence in Afghanistan and conducted terrorist activities in the region. ISIS-K had between 2,000 and 3,000 fighters in the country, although precise estimates are hard to determine. Haqqani Network members and key leaders have increased their public profile and meeting with international envoys since assuming both fo rmal and informal roles within the Taliban following the insurgent group's takeover of Kabul. ISIS-K increased high -profile terrorist attacks in Afghanistan, often targeting members of vulnerable ethnic and religious minority populations such as Hazara Shias. Multiple terrorist incidents targeted members of the Shia community. On August 26, an ISIS -K suicide bomber attacked the Kabul airport, killing 13 U.S. servicemembers and more than 170 Afghan civilians. The United States has not made a de cision to recognize the Taliban or another entity as the Government of Afghanistan but has pressed the Taliban to uphold their counterterrorism commitments under the 2020 U.S. -Taliban Agreement (the \"Doha Agreement\"). The Taliban have repeatedly committed publicly to meet their Doha Agreement commitment to prevent any group or individual from using Afghan soil to threaten the security of the United States and its allies. However, the extent of the Taliban's ability to prevent AQ and ISIS -K from mounting external operations remained unclear. Instability and potential terrorist activities emanating from Afghanistan became a serious concern for the country's neighbors, as they worried about spillover effects from the conflict and instability. ISIS-K, eleme nts of al -Qa'ida (including affiliate AQIS), and terrorist groups targeting Pakistan \u2014 such as Tehrik -e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) \u2014 continued to use the Afghanistan -Pakistan border region as a safe haven. The numbers of attacks and casualties were higher than in 2020. Instability in Afghanistan also affected Central Asian states, which remained on guard against violent extremist el ements from Afghanistan crossing their borders, as well as the potential threat posed by the return of their citizens who traveled to Iraq or Syria to fight with terrorist groups. Tajikistan, which shares an 843 -mile border with Afghanistan, and Uzbekista n strengthened their border security through a large increase in U.S. assistance, as well as additional security cooperation with Russia, China, and others. Tajikistan approved the national strategy on countering extremism and terrorism for 2021 -2025 and adopted a law on combating terrorism. Uzbekistan approved its first \"National Strategy on Countering Extremism and Terrorism for 2021 -2026,\" and the country also finalized its first national CT/CVE and AML/CFT strategies. Elsewhere in the South and Cent ral Asia region, the United States continued to build on its strategic partnership with the Government of India, including through the annual Counterterrorism Joint Working Group and the Quad counterterrorism tabletop exercise alongside Australia and Japan . AFGHANISTAN Overview: During the reporting period, ISIS -K increased high -profile attacks against civilians, often targeting members of vulnerable religious and ethnic minority populations such as Hazara Shias, to spread fear and sow divisions in Afghan society. ISIS-K receiv ed an influx of detained fighters back into its ranks, as ISIS -K members were among the thousands who escaped from Parwan detention facility and Pul -e-Charki prison during the Taliban takeover of Kabul in August. ISIS-K, elements of al -Qa'ida (including a ffiliate AQIS), and terror groups targeting Pakistan, such as TTP, continued to use the Afghanistan -Pakistan border region as a safe haven. Following their takeover of Kabul, the Taliban publicly stated that they were acting to counter ISIS -K and, accordi ng to international media reports, resorted to brutal tactics \u2014 including summary executions \u2014 in doing so. The United States has not made a decision to recognize the Taliban or another entity as the Government of Afghanistan and pressed the Taliban to up hold their counterterrorism commitments under the 2020 U.S. -Taliban Agreement (the \"Doha Agreement\"). The Taliban repeatedly committed publicly to meet their Doha Agreement commitments to prevent any group or individual from using Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: ISIS-K attacks in Afghanistan increased, compared with the previous year. ISIS-K increasingly targeted what it perceived as soft targets in urban areas. This tactic aligned wit h its shift to a configuration of clandestine urban cells in various parts of the country, following its territorial losses in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces in 2019. Significant terrorist incidents included the following: On May 8, a bombing at Sayed Ul -Shuhada high school, located in a predominantly Hazara Shia neighborhood in Kabul, killed at least 90 people \u2014 mostly women and girls. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but international observers widely ascribed the attack to ISIS -K, which had previously conducted similar attacks. On August 26, during U.S. -led evacuation operations, an ISIS -K suicide bomber attacked the Kabul airport, killing 13 U.S. servicemembers and more than 170 Afghan civilians. On October 8, an ISIS -K suicid e bomber attacked a Shia mosque in Kunduz province during Friday prayers, killing more than 40 people and injuring more than 140 others. On October 15, a group of ISIS -K suicide bombers attacked a Shia mosque in Kandahar province during Friday prayers, ki lling 47 people and injuring nearly 70 others. On November 2, ISIS -K fighters and at least one suicide bomber attacked a military hospital in Kabul, resulting in 25 deaths and more than a dozen injuries. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security : The United States has not made a decision to recognize the Taliban or another entity as the Government of Afghanistan. The United States discontinued funding of counterterrorism support following the Taliban takeover. The United States did, however, c losely track Taliban efforts to counter terrorist groups in Afghanistan and condemned reports of brutal tactics. In November, international media reported that the Taliban sent 1,300 fighters to Nangarhar province to conduct operations against ISIS -K. The Taliban reportedly killed and publicly displayed the bodies of individuals they suspected of collaborating with ISIS -K. Taliban provincial leadership reportedly approved these summary executions. The Taliban associated followers of the Salafist interpr etation of Islam with ISIS-K. Some Salafists claimed that the Taliban killed and detained members of their community and closed Salafist mosques. In December the Taliban claimed they arrested more than 600 ISIS -K members in the previous three months and destroyed 25 ISIS -K hideouts in Kabul and Jalalabad. The Taliban also claimed publicly that ISIS -K is no longer a substantial threat in the country, despite the increased attacks. Pakistan alleged that TTP used Afghanistan as a sanctuary. Border tensi ons remained high between the Taliban and neighboring countries, with clashes taking place between the Taliban and Pakistan and Iran. Central Asian states, meanwhile, remained on guard against violent extremist elements from Afghanistan crossing their bor ders. Tajikistan heightened its military posture along its border with Afghanistan, Turkmenistan increased its patrolling, and Russia expressed concern about Central Asian states' potential vulnerability to incursions by violent extremist elements operati ng from Afghanistan. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: In August the Egmont Group disconnected Afghanistan's Financial Intelligence Unit, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center of Afghanistan (FinTRACA), from the Egmont Secure Web. In September, Reuters reported that FinTRACA had ceased operations. Countering Violent Extremism: There were no notable strategies or initiatives for countering violent extremism in Afghanistan during the reporting period. International and Region al Cooperation: No country expressly took a decision to recognize the Taliban as the Government of Afghanistan, and there was no notable counterterrorism cooperation between the Taliban and international, multilateral, or regional organizations during the reporting period. BANGLADESH Overview: In 2021, incidents causing injury and death derived from hate -based communal protests and political differences occurred, with some violent extremist group involvement. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina reemphasized Bangladesh's zero -tolerance policy on terror ism. Terrorist groups increased recruitment and funding activities online. U.S.-trained Bangladesh police units' arrests of terrorist suspects prevented some attacks , although e lements of the security forces have been accused of conducting extrajudicial killings and other human rights violations. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: Terrorist incidents in 2021 included the following: On May 17, police detected a remote -controlled homemade explosive device placed in front of a police box in the city of Narayanganj; U.S. -trained bomb disposal officers neutralized the IED with a U.S.-funded remote -controlled robot. The Counterterrorism and Transnational Crime Unit (CTTC U) suspected ISIS -aligned Neo -Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (Neo -JMB). On July 11, CTTC police in Narayanganj raided a Neo -JMB militants' den, recovering IEDs, bomb making materials, weapons, ammunition, and Neo -JMB pla ns for future attacks. On September 16, Delwar Hossain hurled a petrol bomb in a lone -wolf attack in the Gulshan Diplomatic Zone of Dhaka at what he believed was a vehicle associated with the U.S. Embassy and was immediately arrested. Police believed Hos sain was radicalized to violence online. No injuries were reported. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The Anti terrorism Act of 2009, as amended, remains the basis for the arrest and detention of terrorist suspects. Under the 2018 Digital Security Act (DSA) , the police can counter alleged extremists propagating , funding, radicalizing, recruiting, or distributing hate speech online; domestic and international critics assert the DSA is used to target, harass, and arres t perceived government critics, particularly journalists and political opponents. The CTTC U, the Anti-Terrorism Unit (ATU), and the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) continued raids and arrests against suspected militants. The CTTC U investigated 40 cases and made 85 arrests, most in Dhaka. The Chattogram Metro politan CT police responded to 40 incidents and arrested 10. The ATU, though not yet leading Bangladesh's CT efforts, increased its capacity and reportedly investigated some 7 5 cases. In December, pursuant to the Global Magnitsky sanctions program , the U.S. government sanctioned RAB, several high -level RAB officers, and Bangladesh's top law enforcement official, for serious human rights abuse s. Additionally, several senior RAB officials were designated for involvement in gross violations of human rights under Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriation Act of 2021. RAB and CTTC U's Investiga tion Wing are ineligible for assistance under the Leahy law. Other CT -related units included border guards, Special Branch, Aviation Security, the Airport Immigration Police, and the Airport Armed Police Battalion. Each worked independently. In additio n to Metropolitan Police cyber, SWAT, and bomb disposal training, the U.S. government provided Anti -Terrorism Tribunal (ATT) judges and prosecutors courses on handling evidence, conducting investigations, and prosecuting terrorists and terrorism financing cases, as well as physical courtroom security upgrades. Police and judicial officials cited resource constraints and requested more training and support. Bangladesh has the capacity to patrol land and maritime borders and has improved cargo and passeng er airport screening with updated equipment, procedures, and increased staff. Airline security is not as strong. Bangladesh has initiated e -passports for all and shares information with INTERPOL but has no dedicated terrorist watchlist. A U.S. \"Alert Lis t\" project is under government consideration. Bangladesh does not systematically u se API/PNR passenger information to screen travelers before flights arrive. In 2019 , the ATT sentenced to death seven terrorists for supporting roles in the 2016 Holey Artisan Bakery attack. The Bangladesh Supreme Court still has not ruled on their appeal. The seven ATTs carried a caseload of about 700 cases. Eight Cyber Tribunals, which handle cases arising under the DSA, have a backlog of more than 4,600 cases; most suspects will not receive bail before long -delayed trials. Two ATT judges reportedly received numerous death threats in 2021. Based on CTTC U investigations, ATT in February sentenced five defendants to death for the 2015 murder of Bangladeshi -American Avijit Roy, who wrote books on atheism. The ATT also sentenced eight Ansar -Al-Islam members to death for murdering Roy's publisher, also in 2015. The High Court upheld death se ntences for 10 Harkat -ul-Jihad -al- Islami for attempting Sheikh Hasina in 2000, sentencing 14 additional HUJI -B members to death in March. On August 31, in a high -profile case, ATT sentenced six members of the ban ned Ansarullah Bangla Team to death, acquitting two, for brutally killing in 2016 Xulhaz Mannan, a USAID employee, and his partner Mahbub Rabby Tonoy, for promoting LGBTQI+ rights. On October 3 the ATT convicted two JMB leaders, sentencing one to life in prison and one to death, for a 2005 suicide bombing at a Chattogram court. Counter Terrorist Financing: There have been n o changes since 2020. Countering Violent Extremism: Following a 2019 joint UN/USAID conference to jumpstart the process, police, academics, civil society organizations, and others continued drafting a National Counterterrorism Coordination Strategy. The CTTC U, think tanks, the UN, and universities conducte d CVE -related research on such topics as social profiling, motivating factors, and female radicalization. CTTC led districtwide community engagement awareness workshops to counter extremism. Four U.S -funded NGOs conducted nationwide CVE programming for y outh. The CTTC U reported it had they worked to deradicalize 10 local violent extremists and reintegrate d them and their families into their communities. Bangladeshi violent extremist groups tend to draw ideological inspiration from ISIS, though incre ased online chatter indicated that the Taliban and al-Qa'ida expanded their influence. The government influenced madrassas' curricula, and police worked with community leaders to promote alternative messaging. The government had little capacity to address radicalization efforts in the prison system. Dhaka North, Dhaka South, and Narayanganj are members of the Strong Cities Network. Bangladesh is a partner country of GCERF. International and Regional Cooperation: As international funding dwindled or ended, Bangladeshi organizations curtailed cooperative activities under GCERF and the UN, but the United States and the UN revitalized some programs to reach vulnerable populations, especially young adults 18 to 35 year s old. Bangladesh was active in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. INDIA Overview: In 2021, terrorism affected the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), the northeastern states, and parts of central India. Terrorist groups active in India include Lashkar -ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh. Terrorist tactics showed a shift toward attacks on civilians and greater reliance on IEDs, including an explosives attack using drones on an air force base. The Indian government made significant efforts to detect, disrupt, and degrade operations of terrorist organizations. In October , the United States and India held the 18th meeting of the Counterterrorism Joint Working Group, and in November India hosted the second Quad counterterrorism tableto p exercise along with Australia and Japan. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: During the year, there were 153 terrorist attacks in J&K, causing 274 deaths that includ ed 45 security personnel, 36 civilians, and 193 terrorists. Other notable attacks included an at tack on November 1 in Manipur, in which the People's Liberation Army of Manipur and Naga People's Front killed seven persons in an ambush, including an Indian Army officer and with his wife and minor son. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There were no changes in terrorism - related legislation in 2021. India expanded the number of state -level Multi -Agency Cent ers to strengthen sharing of intelligence among state and federal agencies. India implements UNSCR 2396 by using watchlists, implementing biographic and biometric screening at ports of entry, and prioritizing information sharing. Pursuant to a bilateral arrangement, the U.S. and Indian governments have committed to collaborat ing on improving border security and information -sharing capabilities. The U .S. government is still pending a decision from the G overnment of India on an offer to collaborate on watchlisting assistance. India collaborates with the United States on implement ing UNSCR 2309 and is implementing dual screen X-raying for cargo screening at airport locations. Significant law enforcement actions included the following : A National Intelligence Agency (NIA) Special Court sentenced three Lashkar -e- Tayyiba/Harkat -ul-Jihad -e-Islami terrorists to prison sentences of 10 years for weapons smuggling. Eight Jamaat -ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh terrorists were convicted for attacks with explosives in Bodh Gaya in 2012. Through September, the NIA had investigated 37 cases related to IS IS and arrested 168 people. India responds promptly to U.S. requests for information related to terrorism investigations and makes efforts to mitigate threats in response to U.S. information. Collaborative efforts t o disrupt terrorist travel continue, and alerts are issued to U.S. authorities for possible threats in the United States and against U.S. interests. Indian law enforcement, including border security forces, face budgetary, staffing, and equipment cons traints. Capacity to patrol and secure extensive maritime and land borders is improving but not adequate , given India's extensive coastline. The Government of India does not use the category of Racial and Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremism and opp oses labeling terrorism based on \"the motivation behind such acts.\" Countering the Financing of Terrorism: India is a member of FATF, the Asia /Pacific Group on Money Laundering , and the Eurasian Group. India's Financial Intelligence Unit -India is part of the Egmont Group. There were no changes in terrorism -related legislation in 2021. NIA investigated nine cases of possible terror funding. Countering Violent Extremism: India did not adopt any new strategies or programs for countering terrori st radicalization and recruitment. The Ministry of Home Affairs is the lead agency for CVE . There is no national CVE policy or national CVE coordinator. State governments have the lead on CVE and deradicalization strategies. Media reports and secur ity experts claim donations from private groups in western countries and the Middle East earmarked for religious institutions, social organizations, and schools in India contribute to radicalization to violence . In J&K , the Indian Army runs schools, training courses, recruitment drives, medical camps, and emergency services to prevent \"radicalization. \" Only five of the 28 Indian states have formulated a CVE strategy. CVE efforts are uneven and vary based on local inter ests and contexts. CVE programs target demographics and cohorts at the highest risk of vulnerability for terrorist recruitment. India does not have a policy to repatriate FTFs or their families and has declined to repatriate four Indian citizen spous es of Indian ISIS fighters from Afghanistan. Rehabilitation and reintegration programs for Indians who have joined terrorist or violent extremist organizations on its territory take place at the state or local level. The Ministry of Home Affairs is i n the process of preparing an action plan on strategic messaging to counter radicalization, but it has not been released. At least one Delhi -based think - tank runs a program that promotes alternative narratives to counter online radicalization to violence. Several federal agencies and state police forces monitor online platforms for extremist content and messaging. The NIA arrested two persons in August for disseminating content from the ISIS-affiliated online magazine Voice of Hind. Mumbai is a member of the Strong Cities Network. International and Regional Cooperation: In 2021, India began its two -year term as a nonpermanent member of the United Nations Security Council, where it chairs the Counterterrorism Committee, the 1988 ( Taliban ) Sanctions Committee , and the Libya Sanctions Committee. India has leadership roles i n the following regional and international fora , where it has promoted multilateral CT cooperation: The Global Counterterrorism Forum The Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum Council of Regional Anti -Terrorist Structure of the Shangha i Cooperation Organization (known as RATS SCO) UN Office on Drugs and Crime The Group of Twenty India shares counterterrorism information with Bangladesh , Maldives, and Sri Lanka . India 's defense relationships with Canada , France , and Russia, the United Kingdom extend to counterterrorism issues. India's military exercises with most countries, especially with neighbors such as Nepal, incorporate CT elements. In November , as part of the Quad with the U.S., Australia, and Japan , Indi a hosted a Counterterrorism Tabletop Exercise that addressed international CT responses. KAZAKHSTAN Overview: Kazakhstan remained on guard against the potential for both externally directed and homegrown terrorist attacks. The government continued rehabilitation and reintegration efforts for more than 600 Kazakhstani FTFs and family members repatriated from Syr ia and Iraq since 2019, including 12 returned in February. The government continued to implement its five -year (2018 -22) program against \"religious extremism\" and terrorism, but NGOs and independent observers expressed concerns that terrorism and \"extremi sm\" laws were applied broadly, in some cases against political opponents and adherents of non -violent religious movements. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in Kazakhstan in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, an d Border Security: Kazakhstan has a comprehensive CT legal framework. The lead CT agency is the Committee for National Security (KNB), which coordinates efforts at both the central and local levels. The government approved an ambitious five-year, $900 m illion program in 2018 to counter religious extremism and terrorism. Law- enforcement officers and prosecutors continued to have wide discretion to determine what qualifies as terrorism or extremism . President Tokayev signed amendments into law in Decembe r abolishing the death penalty, including for terrorism -related crimes. Kazakhstani law bans its citizens from fighting in foreign wars. The government has taken a two-pronged approach to citizens returning from Iraq and Syria, prosecuting fighters a nd those suspected of active participation in terrorism while allowing others to reintegrate into their communities, where they have access to state -supported theological counseling and psychological, social, and educational services. After returning more than 600 of its citizens from Iraq and Syria in 2019, Kazakhstan repatriated an additional 12 from northeast Syria in February, including four men, one woman, and seven children. Law-enforcement units demonstrated a strong capacity to detect, deter, and respond to terrorist incidents. There appeared to be an increase in extremism and terrorism -related prosecutions. For example, from January to July, the country registered 139 criminal offenses related to extremism and terrorism, a 19.8 percen t increase from 2020. Local researchers have estimated that up to 90 percent of charges filed under laws against terrorism and \"extremism\" do not involve real or planned violent acts, and in some cases appeared to be connected to political opposition acti vity. For example, in February, a criminal court in Atyrau placed prominent local political activist Max Bokayev on the list of people suspected of financing terrorism and extremism, barred him from public activities, and imposed restrictions on his bank accounts. Courts also continued to deliver harsh sentences for the promotion of extremism online. For example, a Shymkent court handed down sentences of seven to eight years' imprisonment to two individuals for \"propaganda of terrorism\" online and \"incit ement of religious hatred.\" Kazakhstan's Border Guard Service (part of the KNB) and other agencies proactively worked to prevent Kazakhstanis and foreign citizens with suspected terrorist links from traveling to, from, or through Kazakhstan consistent with UNSCR 2396. This included the use of specialized equipment to interdict suspicious or unauthorized travelers at both official and unofficial air, land, and sea crossing points. For example, in September the migration police in Turkistan region detained two Kazakhstani citizens for organizing an \"illegal migration channel\" that helped three Afghan citizens illegally enter Kazakhstan, and in October law -enforcement officers in Kostanay reported preventing an illegal border crossing by two Afghan citizens, though individuals charged wi th \"illegal border crossing\" could be labor migrants or asylum seekers, rather than terrorists. Through a 10 -year contract with a multinational security technology company, Kazakhstan has been working since 2018 to install and operate an API/PNR system to screen travelers. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Kazakhstan belongs to the EAG, and the nation's Committee on Financial Monitoring is a member of the Egmont Group. In preparation for an EAG mutual evaluation planned for completion in 2023, three Financial Asset Task Force recommendations on virtual -asset service providers, politically exposed persons, and transparency and beneficial owners were sent to the legislature for consideration. The Prosecutor General's Office transferred seven terr orist financing cases to the court system during the first 10 months of 2021, up from three during the same period in 2020. Countering Violent Extremism: Even as Kazakhstan's five -year strategy places a heavy emphasis on law enforcement, it also incl udes efforts to promulgate officially approved versions of Islam to youth and provide alternatives to \"extremism\" through social programs and economic opportunities. Working with religious experts, psychologists, and theologians, the Ministry of Informati on and Social Development (MISD) conducted direct outreach in communities across the country; maintained an educational website on religion, state policy, and prevention of terrorism; and operated a nationwide hotline offering consultations on religious qu estions. At the same time, the government continued to block online content it considered extremist. In December, MISD reported that in 2021 the government had identified and removed more than 181,000 online materials promoting \"religious extremism\" an d terrorism, a more than eightfold increase over the previous year. The government also continued to implement rehabilitation and reintegration programs for individuals convicted of extremism -related offenses and their relatives. Aktau and Karaganda are members of the Strong Cities Network. International and Regional Cooperation: Kazakhstan partnered with the United States and international organizations such as UNDP, UNODC, and the OSCE on a variety of CT and CVE projects. For example, the U.S. Agency for International Development piloted several initiatives, including a mentor ship program for former low -level extremism offenders, a project to improve family support services in Aktobe, and a life -skills program in technical colleges in at-risk communities. The U.S. Department of State 's CT Bureau continued implementation of t echnical assistance projects focused on prison -based support for programs that advance community -based rehabilitation and reintegration efforts for returnees from Syria and Iraq. As a member of the C5+1 (the Central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, the Kyrg yz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, plus the United States) diplomatic platform, Kazakhstan participates in the associated C5+1 Security Working Group, which concentrates on regional CT and CVE cooperation. Kazakhstan also participates in CT -related exercises and training through membership in the Collective Security Treaty Organization and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). KYRGYZ REPUBLIC Overview: The Kyrgyz Republic's counterterrorism efforts continue to concentrate on rooting out \"extremists,\" CVE, preventing those returning from conflicts abroad from engaging in terrorist activities, and repatriation of FTF family members. The Kyrgyz government restricts public information on national security issues, making it difficult to assess the efficacy of its CT operations and the extent of the threat. The country remains vulnerable to transnational threats, especially in the remote south, where ill -defined and porous borders allow for the relatively free movement of people and illicit goods. According to government statistics, some 850 Kyrgyz citizens left the country to join terrorist groups over the last decade. The government faces limitations on it s ability to investigate, prosecute, and rehabilitate returning FTFs owing to a lack of expertise and resources, as well as potential shortcomings in the legal framework. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in the Kyrg yz Republic in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There were no significant changes to terrorism -related legislation in 2021; however, changes to the criminal code increased the penalties for creating and financing terrorist orga nizations to 10 and 12 years, respectively. There were no reports in 2021 that the government used CT laws to prosecute political opponents. The Kyrgyz Republic introduced biometric passports in May. The Kyrgyz government does not yet operate an API/PNR system for commercial flights. International organizations and Kyrgyz government officials have expressed concerns that the Prosecutor General's Office and the State Committee for National Security lacked adequate tools and the legal framework to properl y prosecute citizens suspected of committing terrorist acts abroad. Authorities reported several extremism or terrorism -related arrests in 2021, including of individuals accused of recruiting Kyrgyz citizens to join international terrorist organizations. With assistance from UNICEF, the Kyrgyz government repatriated 79 children of FTFs from Iraq in March. The children underwent rehabilitation for several months in a government -managed center and received psychological and medical assistance before being released to family -member guardians. The Kyrgyz government provided information to the U.S. governme nt about known or suspected terrorists and reported lost and stolen travel documents to INTERPOL. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: The Kyrgyz Republic is a member of the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism, an d the country's State Financial Intelligence Service is a member of the Egmont Group. There were no significant changes to the Kyrgyz government's efforts and capacity related to countering the financing of terrorism in 2021. In 2021, the State Financial Intelligence Service fulfilled 125 requests received from law enforcement agencies related to countering terrorist or extremist financing, and 21 cases were registered with the Unified Crime Registry. Countering Violent Extremism: The Kyrgyz government's national program and action plan on countering terrorism was in its fourth year of implementation in 2021. Civil society organizations have expressed concerns that the government used the national program and action plan to muzzle fre e speech and to stigmatize members of ethnic minority groups. Human rights NGOs reported that security services used laws pertaining to so -called extremist materials on the internet to disproportionately target for prosecution ethnic Uzbeks, especially th ose who followed social media accounts focused on Islam. The Ministry of Education, with the State Commission for Religious Affairs (SCRA), continues to implement a curriculum for high school -aged students on \"moderate\" Islam and to identify terrorist recruitment tactics. The Ministry of Interior and the SCRA, in cooperation with local religious leaders and civil society, organizes CVE trainings to prevent radicalization and religious extremism among youth. The Probation Department of the Ministry of Justice held trainings with SCRA and UNDP on preventing extremism among probation clients. UNODC and the Probation Department launched a project on post -release monitoring and probation of FTF and violent extremist prisoners in October. As of the date of this report, there were 138 people convicted of less - serious crimes with religious overtones registered with probation authorities. The SCRA works with the United Nations Population Fund on a project focused on countering radicalization to violen t extremism. The project, which is being implemented in 16 madrassas, concentrated on civic education, the role of Islam in Kyrgyz society, and recognition of recruitment of religious youth by terrorist groups. The SCRA and Mutakalim, an organization focused on peace building through religious tolerance, started an internet -based program to counter recruitment to violence , especially of vulnerable youth. SCRA Research Center, in partnership with Albany Associates, worked on a U.S. Department of State -funded project on strategic communications to counter violent extremism and operationalize the Kyrgyz government's CVE National Action Plan by developing and operationalizing a strategic communications strategy with a focus on mitigating Internet usage by terrorists. The Ministry of Interior blocked 38 \"extremist\" websites and 315 photos and videos. The Kyrgyz government cooperated with the UN, the OSCE, and other international organizations and foreign governments to facilitate CVE training and other CVE -related programs. Bishkek, Jalal-Abad, Osh, and Talas are members of the Strong Cities Network. Bishkek City Hall hosted a City Exchange workshop in December. The SCRA worked with Embassy Bishkek -supported Public Fund \"Ulybka\" to establish an interfaith council in three southern region s to promote and support the development of interfaith dialogue. UNODC worked with the prison administration to secure violent extremists and to develop a system to ensure they were not able to radicalize other inmates. The SCRA and various government mi nistries participated in a conference to learn from the experience of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan on their rehabilitation and reintegration programs for women and children, to understand the challenges of repatriation and rehabilitation of retur nees, and to develop recommendations for the prevention of violent extremism. International and Regional Cooperation: The People's Republic of China and Russia provided financial, organizational, and methodological assistance to law enforcement agen cies in Central Asian countries including the Kyrgyz Republic, regularly conducting joint counterterrorism exercises, providing information on persons suspected of terrorism, and providing military technical assistance, primarily through the Shanghai Coope ration Organization and the Collective Security Treaty Organization. The OSCE Program Office in Bishkek focuses on a range of security issues: from countering terrorism, border security , and transnational threats such as human trafficking, to developing the country's regions, strengthening efforts to combat corruption on all levels, as well as supporting the reform of the justice sector, implementation of election reform, gender equality , and building open and resilient societies. MALDIVES Overview: The Government of Maldives is cognizant of the threat of terrorism and in 2021 continued to focus its counterterrorism efforts on CVE and arrests of Maldivians suspected of plotting IED attacks and \"supporting or promoting a terrorist organization.\" Maldives works with international partners, including the United States, to strengthen CT efforts and capacity. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: On May 6, individuals labeled by the government as Islamic extremists attempted to assassinate Speaker of Parliament Mohamed Nasheed by detonating an IED in the capital city of Mal\u00e9, seriously wounding Nasheed and injuring five others. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The Anti terrorism Act (ATA) is the primary legislation for preventing and prosecut ing terrorism. In December , the Maldivian government passed a third amendment to the ATA. This amendment authorizes Maldives Police Service (MPS) to arrest and detain suspects for certain ATA crimes for up to 48 hours without a warrant; allows courts to consider police intelligence reports in determining detention basis; extends the charging deadline to a maximum of 105 days for detained suspects; authorizes monitoring and control orders against suspects under 18 years of age; outlines special procedures for returning FTFs ; mandates all FTFs either be arrested, placed under a monitoring and control order, undergo a rehabilitation program, or be placed in administrative detention pending a risk assessment; and outlines procedures for registering the birth of children born in conflict zones. The National Counter terrorism Center (NCTC) oversees the CT Intelligence Fusion Center to better coordinate CT efforts. In April, President Solih appointed a secretary to a newly established National Security Advisor office. In August the Minis ter of Home Affairs announced the establishment of a harmonized system to share information related to threats to national security between the Maldives National Defense Force (MNDF), MPS, and other relevant institutions, as required by the ATA. Responsib ility for CT operations, including investigations, rests primarily with MPS. It shares investigative and evidentiary materials with the Prosecutor General's Office (PGO) through an informal cooperative arrangement and provides the PGO with evidentiary pac kets for charging consideration. After charges are filed, MPS continues to support the investigation during the pretrial, trial, and sentencing phases. The MNDF, including the marines and coast guard, are responsible for CT response. The MNDF conducted multiple cooperative engagements with U.S. forces focused on CT operations. The engagements also enhance maritime security capabilities to increase Maldives domain awareness and security. Maldives cooperates with the U nited States to strengthen its border security through use of the U.S. -provided PISCES integrated border security management system , which screens arriving and departing travelers , and through the Customs Department's World Customs Organization's Global Travel Assessment System. I n January, MPS announced it had been granted real -time access to INTERPOL's criminal database. In February, Maldives Immigration successfully implemented an integrated system to automatically upload stolen and lost travel document ( SLTD ) information to IN TERPOL's global database, with assistance from the United States' INTERPOL National Central Bureau in Washington. Nine men whom the government described as supporters of ISIS were charged under the ATA in relation to the May 6 IED attack on Speaker Nash eed. One of the nine, Adhuham Ahmed Rasheed, entered into a plea bargain agreement under which the Criminal Court sentenced him to 23 years ' imprisonment in December. In court, Rasheed said he participated in the attack because of religious beliefs. The remaining eight defendants were in pre -trial proceedings and remained in detention as of year's end. Following the May 6 attack, MNDF and MPS conducted a series of joint operations in Mal\u00e9 and Addu, arresting at least 10 individua ls suspected of being ISIS supporters, some of whom were charged with possession of material promoting a terrorist organization. Prosecutions were still in the pretrial phase at the end of the year. The trial of Mohamed Ameen, the first Maldivian to be l isted as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Affairs Control (OFAC), began in November. Shortly after ward , the Supreme Court overturned the High Court's dismissal of the case. According to OFAC, Ameen materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for goods or services in support of ISIS -K, including through his activities as an ISIS -K recruiter . Ameen had been arrested in 2019 and charged with joining a terrorist organization and planning terror acts under the ATA. The trial was ongoing as of year's end. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Maldives is a memb er of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering. The Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) has the mandate to notify police and relevant authorities in terrorist finance -related cases. The United States has worked with the Government of Maldives to strengthen its AML/CFT efforts. At the end of the year, MMA was working closely with the Attorney General's Office and PGO to amend legislation on AML/CFT , and regulations on asset recovery, w ith assistance from the United States. Countering Violent Extremism: Although President Solih announced Maldives' intent to facilitate the return and prosecution of Maldivian FTFs and families in Syria in 2019, no repatriations occurred during 2021. The Maldives began the development of a National Reintegration Center to process and rehabilitate returning FTFs and their families. The NCTC held numerous regional workshops and capacity building exercises with both public and private sector groups, to in clude counternarrative creation and the role of civil society and local leaders in countering what it considers violent extremism and terrorism. In partnership with the Ministry of Islamic Affairs and the Ministry of Gender, Family & Social Services, the MPS continued CVE programs in islands with \"extremist activities. \" Mal\u00e9 is a member of the Strong Cities Network. International and Regional Cooperation: COVID -19 reduced the ability of government officials to participate in or host international and regional workshops on CT efforts. However, the Government of Maldives continued to work with multilateral and bilateral partners to strengthen its CT effort s. In 2020 , a visiting EU delegation announced the launch of a $2.8 million project to support Maldives ' efforts to counter terrorism and violent extremism . In May, Japan announced a roughly $4.7 million grant to bolster Maldives Immigration and Maldives Customs Service border security efforts. NCTC, in collaboration with UNODC, conducted national - and regional -level capacity building consultations and worksh ops focusing on addressing the rehabilitation and reintegration of returning FTFs and their families. The NCTC also worked with UNDP Maldives, UNODC, and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to increase capacity of law enforcement agenci es and the legal sector and the resilience of civil society organizations. NEPAL Overview: While 2021 saw many anti -Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) protests and threats of violence, including a YouTube video threatening violence against anyone who advocates for MCC, Nepal's security services and MCC political supporters addressed the iss ues without incident. On March 5 the Government of Nepal, and the outlawed Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) splinter group (more commonly called Biplav ), signed a historic peace agreement committing both sides to peacefully resolve their differences thro ugh future political talks. Following the agreement, the Government of Nepal lifted its ban on the group and ceased to investigate and arrest members. Biplav continues to honor the agreement under Prime Minister Deuba. The Nepali government does not provide political, diplomatic, or financial support for international terrorism, nor does it knowingly permit Nepal to be used as a safe haven for terrorists or terrorist groups. Because of the open border with India and insufficient se curity protocols at the country's sole functioning international airport in Kathmandu ; however, Nepal has and could be used as a transit or staging point for international terrorists. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorist incidents repor ted in Nepal in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There were no significant changes to counterterrorism laws in Nepal in 2021. The law enforcement organization directly responsible for counterterrorism activities is the Special Bureau of the Nepal Police. This unit consists of some 120 officers who have specialized and unique training to monitor and counter threat groups and activities throughout Nepal. The Special Bureau is supplemented by Nepal Police and Armed Police F orce officers when necessary. The Nepal Army Special Forces units are tasked with counterterrorism and receive training in hostage rescue, responding to hijackings, and similar terrorism incidents. Airport security controls in Nepal are weak and inad equate. Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport does not prescreen passengers, and landing data are not entered into any database. Physical security checks of passengers are rudimentary. There is no travel document security, and the airport lacks ul traviolet lights to examine documents. The Special Bureau of the Nepal Police assigns approximately 10 personnel to the airport and approximately 15 officers to its INTERPOL office, which is located at Nepal Police headquarters. The INTERPOL office has n o designated personnel at Tribhuvan International Airport, but communication between INTERPOL and airport personnel does occur. INTERPOL notices are acted on and maintained in a database, but passengers are not routinely screened through this database. Security and immigration officials are generally responsive to U.S. requests for information, but often have little information to provide. Nepal shares an open border with India . There are some checkpoints along the 1,000 -mile border, but these lack sufficient security controls and are sometimes staffed by only one immigration official. Most people crossing the border are neither stopped nor checked, and the crossing points can eas ily be circumvented to avoid scrutiny. The primary constraints preventing more effective border -control capability are a lack of resources, information stovepiping among security sector and civilian agencies, and a lack of political will to deploy a more robust approach. The security services lack the personnel, technology, databases, basic equipment, and often electrical power, to provide effective border control. Additional constraints include lack of training and widespread corruption. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: There were n o changes in 2021. Countering Violent Extremism: Nepal does not employ strategic communications to counter violent extremis m. There are no government or civil society programs in Nepal to counter recruitment in to violent extremism or rehabilitate former violent extremists. The government generally does not view violent extremism, specifically violent extremist ideology originating from conflict/instability in the Middle East, as a significant threat in Nepal. A more significant threat is non -Nepali international terrorist groups using Nepal as a transit/staging point or soft target. International and Regional Cooperation: Nepal is a signatory of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation Regiona l Convention on Suppression of Terrorism. INTERPOL hosts an annual regional counterterrorism seminar, to which the Nepal Police sends two to three officers. PAKISTAN Overview: Pakistan took steps in 2021 to counter terror financing and to restrain some India -focused militant groups. Pakistan reviewed and revised its 2015 National Action Plan (NAP) to counter terrorism, reducing the NAP from a 20 -point plan to 14 key points, but made meager progress on the most difficult aspects \u2014 specifica lly its pledge to dismantle all terrorist organizations without delay or discrimination. In September, Pakistan prosecuted Jaish -e-Mohammed (JeM) founder Masood Azhar and JeM leader Abdul Rauf Azhar on terrorism -related charges. In 2018, FATF identified Pakistan as a jurisdiction with strategic deficiencies in its AML/CFT system. Pakistan remained on the FATF gray list in 2021. Pakistan experienced significant terrorist activity in 2021. The number of attacks and casualties was higher than in 2020. Major terrorist groups that focused on conducting attacks in Pakistan included TTP, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), and ISIS -K. Separatist militant groups conducted terrorist attacks against varied targets in Balochistan and Sindh provinces. Terror ists used a range of tactics to attack varied targets, including IEDs, VBIEDs, suicide bombings, and targeted assassinations. In 2018, Pakistan was designated a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. It was redesignated a CPC in 2019, 2020, and 2021. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: Pakistan experienced numerous terrorist attacks in 2021. Members of religious minorities faced significant threats from terrorist groups. The following examples are some of the more -destructive and higher -profile attacks and demonstrate a variety of methods, targets, and perpetrators: On January 3, ISIS -K militants claimed responsibility for the murders of 11 Shia Hazara coalminers in the Kachi district of Balochista n. On April 21, five persons were killed in a VBIED suicide attack in the parking lot of the Serena hotel in Quetta, Balochistan. According to details of the investigation, the attack targeted local and foreign officials. TTP claimed responsibility f or the attack, also claiming the targets were police and law enforcement. On July 14, a VBIED suicide attack killed 10 People's Republic of China workers, an additional civilian, and two Frontier Corps soldiers near the Dasu dam in Upper Kohistan distri ct, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The blast hit a bus that was transporting People's Republic of China workers to the construction site. Pakistani officials reported the blast as a suicide attack perpetrated by the TTP, which the group denied. On October 10, a prominent journalist was killed in an explosion in Hub, Balochistan. According to law enforcement, the bomb was attached to his vehicle. The BLA claimed responsibility for the attack. On December 30, attackers ambushed security officials in North W aziristan. Four security personnel were killed in the ensuing exchange of fire. TTP claimed responsibility for the attack. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The Pakistani government continued to implement the Antiterrorism Act of 199 7, the National Counterterrorism Authority Act, the 2014 Investigation for Fair Trial Act, and major 2014 and 2020 amendments to the Antiterrorism Act, all of which give law enforcement, prosecutors, and courts enhanced powers in terrorism cases. Milita ry, paramilitary, and civilian security forces conducted CT operations throughout Pakistan against anti -state militants. Pakistani law allows for preventive detention, permits the death penalty for terrorism offenses, and creates specialized courts to try terrorism cases. Pakistan collects biometric information at land crossings through its International Border Management Security System. Authorities had limited ability to detect smuggling by air travel. The Customs Service attempted to enforce anti -money laundering laws and foreign exchange regulations at all major airports, in coordination with other agencies. Customs managed the entry of dual -use chemicals for legitimate purposes through end -use verification, while also attempting to prevent their diversion for use in IEDs. Consistent with UNSCR 2178, returning FTFs may be prosecuted under Pakistani law. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Pakistan is a member of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering. Pakistan continued to face signi ficant money -laundering and terrorist financing risks. Several terrorist organizations, including UN -listed groups, operated in Pakistan, raising funds through a variety of means including direct support, public fundraising, abuse of non -profit organizati ons, and through criminal activities. Funds were moved through formal and informal (hawala/hundi) channels. Pakistan's geographic landscape and porous borders increase its vulnerability to terrorist financing and heighten Pakistan's risks. In 2018, FA TF identified Pakistan as a jurisdiction with strategic deficiencies in its AML/CFT regime and placed the country on the FATF gray list. Though Pakistan has made significant progress in addressing noted FATF deficiencies from its 2018 action plan, FATF ma intained Pakistan's position on the gray list owing to one remaining item associated with the investigation and prosecution of terrorist financiers. Countering Violent Extremism: The government operated deradicalization camps offering \"corrective relig ious education,\" vocational training, counseling, and therapy. A Pakistani NGO administered the juvenile -focused Sabaoon Rehabilitation Center in Swat Valley, which it founded in partnership with the Pakistani military. Additional deradicalization center s are operated in Khyber Pakhtunkwha. Some madrassas continued to teach extremist doctrine. While the government continued efforts to increase madrassa regulation, some analysts and madrassa reform proponents observed that many madrassas failed to reg ister with the government, provide documentation of their sources of funding, or comply with laws governing acceptance of foreign students. The Pakistani cities of Nowshera, Peshawar, and Quetta are members of the Strong Cities Network. International and Regional Cooperation: Pakistan took part in several multilateral fora where CT cooperation was discussed, including the Global Counterterrorism Forum, the Heart of Asia - Istanbul Process, the ASEAN Regional Forum, and the South Asian Asso ciation for Regional Cooperation. SRI LANKA Overview: Sri Lanka has continued efforts to enhance its CT capabilities and to improve border security, including through engagement with the United States and other international partners. Efforts were hampered by the COVID -19 pandemic and a government focus on op ening the country for economic recovery. The investigations into the 2019 Easter Sunday suicide attacks undertaken by ISIS -inspired terrorists culminated in the indictment of 25 individuals in August. In November , the government also indicted the former secretary of the Ministry of Defen se and the former Inspector General of Police, who were part of the greater inquiry into the suspected failures of officials to act on available intelligence that might have prevented the 2019 attacks. While the rise of radicalization and extremism are security concerns in Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan government still considers the reorganization of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) \u2014 a U.S. designated FTO that fought the government for 26 years until its military defeat in 2009 \u2014 to be a top threat. LTTE's legacy leaves some government security officials concerned that it could inspire terrorism in Sri Lanka and throughout the diaspora internationally. The government was cooperative in engaging on CT and attende d several meetings of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS as observers. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorist incidents reported in Sri Lanka in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The Government of Sri Lanka continued to use the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), enacted in 1979 as a wartime measure, enabling the police to exercise broad powers to search, arrest, and detain terrori st suspects for investigation. Officially, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reports the detention of 136 suspects under the PTA in 2021 while civil society organizations report that more than 300 detentions remain. A cabinet subcommittee and a committee c omprising senior representatives from across the government w ere appointed in June to revisit the PTA and to bring its provisions in line with contemporary national security requirements as well as Sri Lanka's human rights obligations and commitments. No legislation was implemented in 2021 to directly support investigations or prosecution of terrorism offences. Sri Lanka implemented the Cyber Security Bill and the Defense Cyber Command Bill to strengthen cyber security against cyber -facilitated acts of terrorism. The Border Risk Assessment Cent er (BRAC) officially opened in December at the Department of Immigration and Emigration under the Ministry of Defense, with technical support from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and with $5 mill ion in funding from the government of Australia. The BRAC was established as part of the Integrated Border Management strategy for national agencies to share intelligence, systems, resources, and real - time data. At year's end, 11 organizations were joint ly contributing to the BRAC. Sri Lanka conducted two rounds of Border Security Roundtables with the U.S. Department of State . The discussions focused on the potential implementation of PISCES , INTERPOL connectivity, and the Watchlisting Assistance and Support Program . There were several reports of ex -LTTE cadres trafficking drugs and weapons, with some officials alleging those instances were efforts to resuscitate the LTTE despite the lack of evidence pointing toward organized, coordinated efforts to revive the organiza tion. The recovery of arms, ammunition, and explosives in the Northern and Eastern Provinces where the LTTE was active received enhanced media coverage. In December, authorities recovered 190,755 rounds of ammunition from a workshop in Paranthan, Kilinoc hchi District . Authorities identified a group called the Tamil Eelam Cyber Force that has been hacking government and private websites in Sri Lanka. The Terrorism Investigation Division arrested two suspects in Jaffna for alleged online promotion of the LTTE. In another case, the National Investigations Agency (NIA) of India arrested a former LTTE intelligence operative, 42 -year-old Satkunam (alias Sabesan), for alleged involvement in drugs and arms trafficking from Pakistan to Sri Lanka . The complaint included five other Sri Lankans , following the seizure of five AK - 47 rifles, 300 kilos of heroin, and a thousand 9mm ammunition rounds. The NIA believes that Satkunam was involved in financing an LTTE revival in Sri Lanka. Countering t he Financing of Terrorism: Sri Lanka's FIU took steps for the prevention, detection, investigation, and prosecution of offenses related to money laundering and terrorist financing, though no significant results were evident. No new legislation has been p assed to combat financing of terrorism since 2019. Three cases with charges of terrorism financing are pending in the High Court. The legal provisions of the Financial Transaction Reporting Act are in place for future law enforcement efforts. Counte ring Violent Extremism: No FTFs or associated family members were repatriated in 2021. The Commissioner General of Rehabilitation is working on a reintegration mechanism to deradicalize youths back into their families. The government of Sri Lanka is looking to educational reforms to enhance skills development for employment. The Commissioner General is studying conflict prevention strategies for communities and continues to participate in meetings of the South Asian Network on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism. International and Regional Cooperation: The GCERF Sri Lanka project was launched in 2021 . The United States and other donors contributed to the development and approval of the program strategy and are regularly updated on the progress of the program. UNODC has worked with the U.S. Embassy on prison system reforms in Sri Lanka, specifically targeting the need to construct prison courtrooms to facilitate hearings. These efforts will address delays in the judicial system that contribute to long detention periods, which can lead to radicalization to violence . The United States discussed strate gies with Quad country and like -minded partners on how to support Sri Lanka in countering terrorism. TAJIKISTAN Overview: Tajikistan shares an 843 -mile border with Afghanistan, and after the Taliban takeover of Kabul in August, Tajikistan's governme nt redoubled its counterterrorism efforts. In 2021, the U.S. government moved forward with plans to renovate and build border outposts along the Tajikistan -Afghanistan border and provided equipment, such as offroad vehicles, and training to enhance Tajikistan's counterterrorism capabilities. Tajikistan partic ipates in exercises with the United States and regional partners, including the annual security exercise Regional Cooperation, which it is scheduled to host in 2022. In 2021, Tajikistan conducted more than 50 bilateral engagements with the U.S. Department of Defense. Russia agreed to fund construction of an outpost along the Afghan border and reportedly worked with Tajikistan to re -equip the country's army. Tajikistan participated in counterterrorism -focused exercises with Russia, other Collective Securi ty Treaty Organization (CSTO) member states, and the P eople's Republic of China . The government asserted that northern Afghanistan was a primary source of terrorist activity and host to thousands of militants. Six terrorist incidents, including two attac ks, were reported in Tajikistan in 2021. Tajikistan cooperates with regional and international organizations, such as the EU, the OSCE, and the UN on combating terrorism. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, there were two terrorist attacks and four attempted terrorist attacks in 2021. Authorities implicated the banned opposition Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan and ISIS-affiliated groups in the planning of several attempted attacks but did not supply further details regarding these or other incidents. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: On December 23, Tajikistan adopted a Law on Combating Terrorism, which superseded the 1999 counterterrorism law. The law defines basic counterterr orism principles and establishes Tajikistan's legal and organizational framework for counterterrorism efforts. New elements in the 2021 law include frameworks for : 1) informational efforts to combat terrorism, 2) protection of individuals and facilities, particularly critical infrastructure, and 3) countering terrorist financing. The law lays the foundation for counterterrorism operations and international counterte rrorism cooperation. The law names the following state entities as directly involved in combating terrorism: the State Committee on National Security, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Prosecutor General's Office (PGO), the Ministry of Defense, the Agency on State Financial Control and the Fight Against Corruption, the Drug Control Agency, the National Guard, and the Committee on Emergency Situations and Civil Defense. The Ministry of Internal Affairs stated that it identified 579 members of terrorist or \"extremist \" organizations in 2021 and arrested 339, including dozens of alleged proponents of Salafi Islam and members of banned opposition groups. The Ministry of Internal Affairs reported cooperatio n with foreign partners in the detention and repatriation of 50 members of terrorist and extremist organizations. Also in 2021, 75 members of extremist organizations or participants in hostilities abroad were voluntarily repatriated to Tajikistan and pard oned, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs . On December 8 , the Tajik Parliament's lower house ratified a joint air defense agreement with Russia that defense officials said would help counter growing regional threats, such as terrorist use of unmanned aerial systems. The agreement's initial term reportedly is five years. The OSCE's Border Management Staff College held a November roundtable in Dushanbe on security threats to Central Asia from Afghanistan. Participants from Tajik government agencies, civil society, diplomatic missions, international organizations, and foreign militaries exchanged views on strengthening border security cooperation. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Tajikistan is a member of the Eurasian Group on Com bating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism, and the National Bank of Tajikistan's (NBT 's) Financial Monitoring Department is a member of the Egmont Group. The Government of Tajikistan continued its efforts to improve the banking sector's capacity to combat terrorism financing in 2021. Tajikistan adheres to FATF requirements and has made various commitments to this body. The Ministry of Internal Affairs reported 15 cases of terrorist financing in 2021. The Financial Monitoring Department website maintained a list of individuals and entities allegedly involved in terrorism, including those sanctioned under UNSC resolutions. Press have reported that the NBT's list includes opposition activists and journalists in exile. The NBT continued to operate a national money transfer center that centralized the receipt of remittances from abroad. The NBT asserted that this system allowed it to monitor and regulate alternative remittance services, wire transfers, and nonprofit organizations to prevent terrorist financing. Countering Violent Extremism: In June, Tajikistan's president approved the national strategy on countering \"extremism \" and terrorism for 2021 -25 and the action plan for its implementation. Hedayah , an internationally -backed CVE center of excellence, in 2021 began a project to assist Tajikistan with implementing its CVE Nation al Action Plan and developing an effective communications strategy to counter radicalization to violence and recruitment of FTFs. Tajikistan amended its criminal laws in 2015, allowing authorities to pardon Tajik FTFs who voluntarily return home from a broad, express remorse for their actions, and renounce ties to foreign terrorist groups. In January , the Ministry of Justice opened a legal case against the UK -based NGO Saferworld, which had been implementing U.S. Embassy CVE programs since 2018. In April , a court ruled that Saferworld must shut down its office in Tajikistan because of alleged violatio ns of Tajik laws. The Tajik government continued to place heavy restrictions on groups it classifies as extremist, including on those groups' political and religious expression. On November 15 , the U.S. Secretary of State redesignated Tajikistan as a \"country of particular concern\" under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. International and Regional Cooperation: On November 10, UNODC provided investigations - focused training on countering terrorist financing to officials from the Ministry of Internal Affairs , the NBT, the anticorruption agency, and the PGO. Tajikistan actively participates in regional security arrangements such as the CSTO and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. On May 19, Dushanbe, as part of its 2021 chairm anship, hosted the CSTO's Council of Foreign Ministers meeting, where participants discussed cooperation to ensure regional security by strengthening the Tajikistan -Afghanistan border and combating terrorism, extremism, and transnational organized crime. Tajikistan's government supports the C5+1, a diplomatic platform for coordination among the five Central Asian states plus the United States and serves as co -chair of the C5+1 Security Working Group. TURKMENISTAN Overview: In 2021 , the Government of Turkmenistan continued its efforts to improve the capacity of law enforcement agencies to combat terrorism, ensure border security, and detect terrorist financing. Turkmenistan actively cooperates with international organizations and participates in the C5+1 diplomatic platform to counter international terrorism. Turkmen authorities maintain close surveillance on the country's population and its borders. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in Turkmen istan in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The Government of Turkmenistan strengthened an existing law (AML/CFT/ Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction ) on countering money laundering, combating the financing of terrorism, and counterin g the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as part of its Second National Risk Assessment ( or NRA -2) in May. The revisions were suggested by the OSCE. Counteri ng the Financing of Terrorism: In 2021, the Government of Turkmenistan continued cooperation with the UN Counter terrorism Office, the EU, and the OSCE on countering terrorism financing. Turkmen law enforcement officers took part in antiterrorism training, including on biometric data exchange and money laundering. The Turkmen government continues to regulate alternative remittance services, collect data on wire transfers, and monitor non-profit organizations as part of a broader effort to prevent the sponsorship of terrorist activities. Turkmenistan belongs to the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism. The Financial Monitoring Service of Turkmenistan became a member of the Egmont Group in 2019. Countering Vio lent Extremism: In 2021, the Turkmen government continued its cooperation with international organizations and participated in the C5+1 diplomatic platform on countering violent extremism. The Government of Turkmenistan also participated in UNDP -led trai nings on preventing and countering violent extremism, as part of its global \"Strengthening Resilience to Violent Extremism\" in Asia project. International and Regional Cooperation: Turkmenistan works with international and regional organizations such a s the UN Counter -Terrorism Implementation Task Force, the UN Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia, UNODC, the UN Counter terrorism Cent er, the EU, and the OSCE. As a member of the C5+1, Turkmenistan also participates in the associated Security Working Group. Among others, the G overnment of Turkmenistan has sent high-level delegations to the OSCE Regional Conference on Combating Terrorism and Organized Crime in March , the Ministerial C5+1 virtual dialogue on Afghanistan in April , the International Conference on Central and South Asia regional Connectivity, which included a discussion on security and extremism issues, in July , and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization gathering on border security in September. UZBEKISTAN Overview: The Taliban takeover of Kabul heightened the Government of Uzbekistan's concerns about the potential spillover of terrorism from Afghanistan and its Central Asian neighbors, particularly by ISIS -Khorasan Province, as well as Islamic Jihad Union, Is lamic Movement of Uzbekistan, Katibat al -Imam al -Bukhari, and Jamaat Ansarullah. Terrorism and violent extremism concerns regarding Uzbekistani migrant laborers abroad and ISIS fighters returning from Iraq and Syria persisted. The government continued to repatriate FTF family members . Uzbekistan increased efforts to counter terrorist use of the internet for radicalization to violence, recruitment, and training. The government finalized and approved its first national CT/CVE strategy and national AML/CFT strategy. Uzbekistan continu ed active regional and international security cooperation. Uzbekistan remained an active participant in the C5+1 diplomatic platform and related CT/CVE cooperation; Uzbekistani ministries, agencies, civil societies, and non -governmental organizations coor dinated with the U.S. Departments of Energy, Defense, and State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development on various CT and CVE initiatives. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorist incidents in Uzbekistan in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Uzbekistan's first \"National Strategy on Countering Extremism and Terrorism for 2021 -26\" targeted cyber, prosecutorial, and regulatory and legislative framework improvements. The Law on Combating Terrori sm governs terrorism -related investigations and prosecutions and identifies the State Security Service (DXX) as the lead CT law enforcement agency. The national CT/CVE strategy charges Prime Minister Aripov and National Security Council Secretary Viktor M akhmudov with implementation and requires ministries, DXX, and the Security Council to submit biannual updates for presidential review. DXX, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the National Guard have dedicated CT units. Uzbekistani law enforcement tracks terrorist data and contributes to INTERPOL databases, including the SLTD database, through the I -24/7 network and its INTERPOL National Central Bureau. Most official land and air border crossings are equipped with biometric data scanners. Uzbekist an implemented an ID card system to replace biometric passports and reported the development of an API/PNR system in line with requirements under UNSCRs 2309 and 2396. Uzbekistan repatriated 93 FTF family members \u2014 62 children, including seven orphans, and 24 women \u2014 from Syria in the Mehr -5 operation. The Government of Uzbekistan continued to reintegrate FTF family members into their home communities and identified suitable families for many unaccompanied minors. In close cooperation with UNICEF, the government monitored returnees' progress and provided a mix of national - and local -level rehabilitation and reintegration medical, psychological, administrative, social, educational, religious, and financial services. Uzbekistani law enforcement announc ed several arrests related to terrorism and violent extremism. Changes in Afghanistan's border security and migration patterns complicated efforts to deter and prevent terrorist travel; after August , the government cooperated with the Taliban on border security and terrorist apprehension. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Uzbekistan's FIU is an Egmont Group member. Uzbekistan belongs to the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (EAG), which submitted its draft regional risk assessment report at the 35 th plenary in November. The Academy of the General Prosecutor's Office hosted an international conference on legal science and education, where the EAG Secretariat presented a report on the importance of legislative establishment and financial investigation procedure regulation to AML/CFT. Uzbekistan's new national AML/CFT strategy targeted prosecution and accountability improvements and required Uzbekistan to bring the national AML/CFT/counter -WMD proliferation financing system in line with international FATF standards. Uzbekistan amended legislation to outline and adjust AML/CFT reporting procedures and approved regulations for suspending and resuming operations and freezing the asset s of individua ls participating or suspected of participating in terrorism or WMD proliferation. The events in Afghanistan presented new challenges on money laundering, arms trafficking, and narcotrafficking. Countering Violent Extremism: President Shavkat Mirziyoy ev issued a decree to strengthen efforts to prevent and counter online violent extremism and terrorist ideology. According to the government, Uzbekistan amended legislation and updated the law \"On Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organizations\" to coun ter radicalization to violence and terrorist recruitment. For further information, see the Department of State's International Religious Freedom Report . The Government of Uzbekistan reported empowering Imam -khatibs to lead CVE conversations in mosques, educational institutions, and labor collectives; youth leaders to facilitate communication between vulnerable youth and community leadership; and assisting vulnerable youth through business and entrepreneurshi p financing. The government and non -governmental organizations continued to use advertisements, countermessaging campaigns, and training to prevent radicalization of at -risk citizens and labor migrants. Official media continued posting about the dangers of \"extremism. \" The Government of Uzbekistan continued its active role in the C5+1 regional CVE and FTF framework through virtual and hybrid CVE and repatriation workshops, online youth resilience building, and community leader and rehabilitation and re integration care provider trainings. International and Regional Cooperation: Uzbekistan's multilateral CT/CVE engagements included the following : Present ed at a UN Counter -Terrorism Committee roundtable on national CT/CVE action plan implementation . Support ed the fourth phase of the UN regional counterterrorism strategy implementation project . Host ed Fionnuala N\u00ed Aol\u00e1in, the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism ; AML/CFT training and discussions with the EU's Law Enforcement in Central Asia project . Collaborat ed with the OSCE Action Against Terrorism Unit and participatin g in a virtual regional OSCE expert dialogue on FTF repatriation . Present ed at a Defeat -ISIS Coalition Counter -ISIS Financing Working Group . Uzbekistan, the 2021 -22 Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Chair, participated in the SCO Regional Anti terrorist Structure Joint Anti terrorist Exercises. The country remained engaged in CT -related activities with the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), of which Uzbekistan has not been a member since 2012. Uzbekistan participated in a joint counterterrorism military exercise in India; joint CSTO counterterrorism military exercises with Tajikistan and Russia near the Afghan border; and the SCO Peace Mission 2021 counterterrorism military exercise in Russia. Uzbekistani law enforcement cooperates on terrorism detection and investigation with foreign countries. WESTERN HEMISPHERE Overview Terrorism remained a security concern for most countries throughout the Western Hemisphere in 2021. National or locally oriented groups, such as the National Liberation Army ( Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional, or ELN), Segunda Marquetalia, and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -People's Army (FARC -EP) in Colombia and Venezuela and Shining Path/ Sendero Luminos o in Peru remained the region's most significant terrorist threats. Transnational terrorist organizations have a limited pres ence, with small pockets of supporters in the region. Corruption, weak governmental institutions, insufficient interagency cooperation, weak or nonexistent legislation, and limited resources \u2014 all compounded by the COVID -19 pandemic \u2014 remained obstacles t o improving security in 2021. Nevertheless, governments in the Western Hemisphere made significant progress in their counterterrorism efforts and strengthened regional cooperation against terrorism. Lebanon -based and Iran -backed terrorist group Hizballa h continued its long history of activity in the Western Hemisphere, including fundraising by its supporters and financiers in places like the tri-border area, where the borders of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay meet. Hizballah supporters generate funding through licit and illicit activity and donate undetermined amounts to Hizballah in Lebanon, which uses the funds to advance its broader agenda. In recent years, Hizballah supporters and members have been identified in Chile, Colombia, Panama, Peru, and t he United States. On November 30, the U.S. Secretary of State revoked the designation of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), reflecting FARC's formal disarmament and dissolution as a unified orga nization that engages in terrorism or terrorist activity or has the capability or intent to do so in accordance with the 2016 Peace Accord. Simultaneously, the Secretary designated FARC dissident groups Segunda Marquetalia and FARC -EP (Ej\u00e9rcito del Pueblo , in Spanish) as FTOs and their leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists. Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela all experienced continued terrorist activity. Segunda Marquetalia, FARC -EP, and the ELN continued to commit acts of terror througho ut Colombia, including bombings, kidnappings, violence against civilian populations and demobilized FARC members, attacks against utilities infrastructure, and violent attacks against military and police facilities. Authorities in the Western Hemisphere actively participated in multilateral and regional efforts to counter terrorism. Peru remained determined to uphold its commitment to host the next CT ministerial conference despite having to delay until 2022. The Organization of American States' Inter -American Committee Against Terrorism (OAS -CICTE) held its 20th regular session on September 25. Several countries in the region joined the U.S. -funded OAS -CICTE 24/7 Inter - American Network on Counterterrorism, which seeks to strengthen cooperation between member states to prevent and address terrorist threats in the Western Hemisphere. ARGENTINA Overview: In 2021, Argentina continued to focus its counterterrorism strategy on the tri -border area (TBA) of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay , where suspected terrorism financing networks operate. Despite significant travel limitations attributable to COVID -19, robust U.S. -Argentine law enforcement and security cooperation continued in 2021. Argentina maintained Hizballah's listing on its dome stic registry of terrorist groups and entities for the second year. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in Argentina during 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Plans to change the criminal co de's legal framework for terrorism cases remained delayed in 2021. The executive branch drafted and submitted legislation to Congress for approval in 2019; however, it has not yet been approved. Multiple security agencies maintained specialized law enfo rcement units that have substantial capabilities to respond to criminal activities, including terrorist incidents. Argentina continued to develop its nationwide network of law enforcement intelligence fusion centers and to incorporate biometric data at po rts of entry to fight against international terrorism and transnational crime. The nation continued cross -border coordination through its participation in the Tripartite Command, an interagency security mechanism created by Argentina, Brazil, and Parag uay to exchange information and combat transnational threats, including terrorism, in the TBA. According to local press, on May 7 federal security forces conducted multiple raids targeting five persons with potential links to ISIS in the provinces of Buenos Aires, C\u00f3rdoba, and Santa Fe and seized their phones and computers, which allegedly contained instructions for manufacturing explosives. The lack of justice for the 1994 Argentine Jewish Mutual A ssociation ( AMIA ) suicide terrorist bombing remained in the news, as did developments in several legal cases investigating the attack itself and judicial failures in its aftermath. In 2020 , a federal court announced that it had decided to acquit Carlos Te lleld\u00edn, who had been charged with providing the vehicle used in the bombing; the court's main argument was related to insufficient evidence. The public prosecutor's office appealed the decision on May 3 , and the case is now with the criminal appeals cour t. On October 7 , a federal court announced that it had dropped charges against Vice President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (CFK) in what was known as the \"Iran MOU Case.\" Prosecutors had accused CFK and codefendants of treason for allegedly engaging i n a 2013 bilateral agreement with Iran with the intent of covering up Iran's involvement in the AMIA attack in exchange for lucrative trade agreements. The federal tribunal ruled that while the MOU may have been a poor political decision, it did not const itute a crime. The plaintiffs appealed on October 24, and the case is now with the criminal appeals court. No new names were added to the Public Register of People and Entities Linked to Acts of Terrorism and Their Financing (RePET) in 2021. RePET was created by presidential decree in 2019 and includes UNSC -designated terrorist groups and individuals linked to Hizballah and the AMIA bombing. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Argentina is a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), as well as the Financial Action Task Force of Latin America, a FATF -style regional body. Its financial information unit (FIU) is a member of the Egmont Group. The TBA is one of the principal routes into Argentina for counterfeiting, drug trafficking, multi -billion - dollar trade -based money laundering, and other smuggling operations. In addition, many of the money laundering organizations in the TBA have suspected links to Hizballah. The U.S. State Department funded the Argentina's Department of Justice to implement capacity building activities and training focused on strengthening the nation 's ability to identify and disrupt transnational crimes linked to terrorist financing. For further information on money laundering and financial crimes, see the 2021 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR), Volume II, Money Laundering and Financial Crimes . Countering Violent Extremism: The Government of Argentina has systematically issued statements of condemnation against major acts of terrorism. International and Regional Cooperation: Argentina participated in the virtual Forum of Parliamentarians Against Terrorism in July and the Organization of American States Inter - American Committee Against Terrorism in October. BRAZIL Overview: Brazil and the United States maintained strong counterterrorism cooperation in 2021, building on collaborative efforts under way since the 2016 Summer Olympics. The Brazilian Federal Police (PF), Brazil's lead CT agency, worked closely with the United States and other nations' law enforcement entities to assess and mitigate potential terrorist threats. The Brazilian government con tinued to support CT activities, which included third -country technical assistance for controlling sensitive technologies and investigating fraudulent travel documents. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorist incidents reported in Brazil in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There were no major changes to CT legislation in 2021. The president proposed new CT legislation, which is still under consideration in Congress but likely does not have the votes for passage in the Senate. Under current laws, the PF opened 12 terrorism investigations in 2021. There have been 63 inquiries and 11 convictions in the five years the law has existed. On December 2 , the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated a Brazil -based network of al -Qa'ida-affiliated individuals and their companies for providing support to al-Qa'ida. Among those designated was Haytham Ahmad Shukri Ahmad Al -Maghrabi, who was one of the first identified individuals linked to this al - Qa'ida network in Brazil. This action will freeze assets and accounts in the United States for all the named individuals. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Brazil is a member of FATF and the Financial Action Task Force of Latin America. Brazil's FIU, the Council for Financial Activities Control, is a member of the Egmont Group. The CT Bureau began funding the Countering Financing of Terrorism Project in 2021, implemented by the American Bar Association. This program will build the capacity of governments and financial sector stakeholders in Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay to degrade and disrupt the financing of Hizballah and other terrorist groups, thus limiting their ability to plan and car ry out attacks in the TBA region and globally. Countering Violent Extremism: In 2021 , the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) worked closely with the PF and frequently shar ed information on violent extremist activity on the internet. As a direct result of HSI information, on December 21 the PF arrested members of a neo -Nazi cell that had allegedly been planning mass -casualty attacks in Brazil. The PF uncovered weapons , including pipe bombs , during the raid. International and Regional Cooperation: Brazil participated in regional CT fora, including the Organization of American States Inter -American Committee Against Terrorism ; the Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa Joint Working Group on CT ; and the Southern Common Market's working group on terrorism and sub -working group on financial issues. Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay coordinated law enforcement efforts in the TBA by means of their Trilateral TBA Command. Brazil is a member of the Regional Security Mechanism. CANADA Overview: Canada's National Terrorism Threat Level remained at \"Medium\" through 2021, meaning a violent act of terrorism could occur. The February Roadmap for a Renewed U.S. -Canada Partnership committed to enhancing bilateral cooperation to counter exploitation of social media and the internet by terrorists, violent extremists, and hate groups; strengthening information sharing related to domestic violent extremism (DVE); and enhancing reciprocal sharing on known and suspected threats. The Public Safety Canada (PS) -U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) -led DVE Working Group began developing a joint threat assessment on DVE connectivity between the neighboring countries, including a comparison of respective designation and listings processes. Additionally, PS's Canada Centre for Community Engagement and Prevention of Violence continued its close collaboration with its U.S. counterpart, DHS's Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships, on initiatives to prevent and counter radicalization to violence, including online. 2021 Terrorist Incidents : On June 6, Canadian citizen Nathaniel Veltman allegedly rammed a truck into Muslim Pakistani Canadian pedestrians in London, Ontario, killing four persons and wounding one \u2014 all members of the same family. The attack was allegedly motivated at least in part by Islamophobia. London Police Service (LPS) charged Veltman with four counts of first - degree mur der and one count of attempted murder . LPS, working in conjunction with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Ministry of the Attorney General, and Canada's Public Prosecution Service, determined the murders constituted terrorist activity under Canadian law. The Federal and Provincial Attorneys General commenced terrorism proceedings, alleging the murders and the attempted murder also constituted terrorist activity. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Canada's strict privacy laws conti nued to limit counterterrorism -related intelligence sharing among Canada's law enforcement agencies, and between Canada and other countries, including the United States. Although Canada's Criminal Code includes sections on terrorist activities, prosecutors have limited their pursuit of charges under these statutes because the legal bar is high and cases have raised complex questions of potentially overlapping offenses. Prosecutors typically choose to pursue more -straightforward charges against those suspected of terrorist activities (e.g., murder), a trend that continued in 2021. Canada continued to resist repatriation of FTFs and their family members from Syria, asserting it was unable to send staff to assist owing to the security situation within Syria. In 2021, former U.S. diplomat Peter Galbraith facilitated the return to Canada of a woman and her minor daughter from a cam p for displaced persons affiliated with ISIS in Syria via Iraq. Galbraith said his effort was a private initiative; the Canadian government indicated it was not involved in the pair's exit from Syria. On February 3 , Canada listed 13 new terrorist entities under Canada's Criminal Cod e and , on June 25 , listed four additional new terrorist entities. In 2021 , there were developments in ongoing legal proceedings with a terror nexus: On May 20, Ontario's Superior Court of Justice ruled Iran's shooting down of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 in 2020 was an intentional act of terrorism. Fifty -five Canadian citizens and 30 Canadian permanent residents were among the victims. On August 26, Canadian citizen Saad Akhtar pleaded guilty to charges of murder and terrorism following his 2020 killing o f a woman in Toronto. A note that Akhtar placed beside his victim included an ISIS slogan and said the murder was committed in service to ISIS. The case marked Canada's first conviction for the crime of \"murder \u2014 terrorist activity.\" Akhtar was sentence d to life in prison with no eligibility for parole for 25 years. Following his guilty plea on weapons charges in June, Patrik Mathews, a former Canadian Armed Forces reservist and member of violent white supremacist group The Base, was sentenced October 2 8, in U.S. federal court, to nine years in prison for his role in a neo -Nazi plot to instigate a race war in the United States. Federal prosecutors successfully argued for a \"terrorism enhancement\" of Mathew s's sentence, asserting he promoted a federal cr ime of terrorism even though he himself was not charged with terrorism. On December 10, Saudi -born Canadian citizen Mohammed Khalifa, a leading ISIS media figure and FTF, pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court to conspiring to provide material support to an FTO (ISIS), resulting in death. Two applications for peace bonds were made in 2021 pursuant to Section 810.011 of Canada's Criminal Code (\"Fear of Terrorism Offence\"); these were still before the court at year's end, and the individuals involved had not been charged with an offense. The individuals' names and identifying information were withheld; one was a minor , and the other's identity was protected by a publication ban. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Canada is a member of FATF and the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering. Canada's FIU, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre ( known as FINTRAC), is a member of the Egmont Group. On June 1, several amendments to regulations under Canada's Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act entered into force, significantly overhauling Canada's related regulatory landscape and closing gaps in the existing framework, such as those stemming from technological advances (e.g., cryptocurrencies). Countering Violent Extremism: The Canada Centre for Community Engagement and Prevention of Violence continued its work to develop related policy an d on partner/stakeholder engagement and coordination, research, and programming. It also administered the Community Resilience Fund, a grants and contributions program that provides financial support to organizations working to improve Canada's understand ing of \u2014 and capacity to prevent and counter \u2014 violent extremism. In 2021, Canada continued its financial support to and was a board member of the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund, a multilateral organization that funds local programs to pr event and counter violent extremism. International and Regional Cooperation: In 2021, Canada continued its term as co -chair of the GCTF and was active in the development and finalization of GCTF's Strategic Vision for the Next Decade , endorsed by ministers in October. The country also is a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum. Canada was an active participant in the Defeat -ISIS Coalition's Stabilization, Counter -ISIS Financing, Foreign Terrorist Financing, and Communications working gr oups. In May , the UN Counter -Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate conducted a hybrid visit to Canada on behalf of the Counter terrorism Committee. COLOMBIA Overview: On November 30, Secretary Blinken designated Segunda Marquetalia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -People's Army (FARC -EP, Ej\u00e9rcito del Pueblo ) as FTOs. At the same time, the Secretary revoked the designation of FARC as an FTO. Following the 2016 Peace Accord between FARC and the Colombian government, the National Liberation Army (ELN), Segunda Marquetalia, and FARC -EP terrorist organizations saw a resurgence and in some areas of Colombia have been filling the void left by former FARC combatants who permanently left the battlefield. As of December, roughly 13,000 FARC ex -combatants (including former rank -and-file guerrillas and militia) contin ue to participate in the reintegration process based on the 2016 Peace Accord. Challenges to Peace Accord implementation and continued security vacuums created ongoing risk of terrorist activity and attacks on civilians, security forces, and infrastructur e in 2021. Open -source reporting suggests that support networks and armed members of Segunda Marquetalia and FARC -EP have a combined strength of an estimated 4,500 to 5,000 members . Similarly, estimates of ELN members and supporters hover around 5,000. Colombian -U.S. counterterrorism cooperation remains strong. While Colombia is not a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, Colombia has openly condemned ISIS and its objectives. 2021 Incidents: In 2021, Segunda Marquetalia, FARC -EP, and ELN continued to commit acts of terrorism throughout the country, including bombings, violence against civilian populations and infrastructure , kidnapping, and violent attacks against military and police facilities. Terrorist incidents in 2021 include d the following : On March 26, FARC -EP detonated a car bomb outside of a mayoral office in Corinto, Cauca, 37 miles south of Cali, Colombia's third -largest city. The bombing injured 43 people. Mostly peaceful nationwide protests beginning in April were co -opted in some areas of the country by Segunda Marquetalia and ELN terrorists who, in some instances, directed protestors in acts of violence against Colombian security forces and provided weapo ns and other supplies to protestors. On June 15, FARC -EP claimed responsibility for bombing a Colombian Army base in C\u00facuta along the Colombia -Venezuela border. The bombing resulted in 36 injuries, including one member of the U.S. military, who sustained minor injuries. On June 25, President Duque's helicopter was shot by FARC -EP members as it attempted to land in C\u00facuta during an official visit. On December 14, FARC -EP detonated a bomb at C\u00facuta's Camilo Daza International Airport, killing three persons . Colombian authorities have concluded that the attacks were planned by FARC -EP members residing in Ve nezuela. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There were no changes to terrorism - related legislation and investigation procedures in 2021. In November, Colombian authorities working with INTERPOL arrested Russian citizen Vladimir Taranet c, alias Ali Ali, at Bogot\u00e1's El Dorado International A irport during a layover on his way from T\u00fcrkiye to Guatemala. Ali Ali had an outstanding INTERPOL red notice issued by Russia, which says Ali Ali was a member of ISIS and committed acts of terrorism in Iraq and Syria. In August, media cited Colombian security officials in disclosing a plot allegedly orchestrated by an Iranian named Rahmat Asadi to pay two Colombians $100,000 to kidnap and kill two Israeli businessmen in Bogot\u00e1. The sources claimed that Asadi had close ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and reportedly met the two hired Col ombians while in a Dubai prison after being extradited from Thailand on murder charges. The Israeli businessmen were notified of the plot and fled. The two Colombians reportedly also fled after Asadi threatened them for not following through on the assas sination plot. Colombian border security remained an area of vulnerability as military and law enforcement agencies continued to face the challenge of working in areas with porous land borders, difficult topography, illegal armed groups, and drug traffic king. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Colombia is a member of FATF, and its FIU, Colombia's Financial Information and Analysis Unit , is a member of the Egmont Group. In August, Colombia's Council on Economic and Social Policy approved financin g to strengthen the capacity of the government to combat money -laundering and terrorism financing. Countering Violent Extremism: In 2021, roughly 13,000 FARC ex -combatants and former militia members who demobilized under the 2016 Peace Accord contin ued to participate in social and economic reintegration activities. Colombia continued to employ a modern, multi - agency approach to CVE. The number of members of armed groups \u2014 including ELN, Segunda Marquetalia, FARC -EP, Clan del Golfo, Los Los Caparros \u2014 who demobilized individually in 2021 was 278. Of those 278, 160 were minors. International and Regional Cooperation: There were no changes since 2020. MEXICO Overview: Counterterrorism cooperation between Mexico and the United States remained strong in 2021. There was no credible evidence indicating international terrorist groups established bases in Mexico, worked directly with Mexican drug cartels, or sent operative s via Mexico into the United States in 2021. Still, the U.S. government remains vigilant against possible targeting of U.S. interests or persons in Mexico by individuals inspired by international terrorist groups. The U.S. southern border remains vulnera ble to terrorist transit, but to date there have been no confirmed cases of a successful terrorist attack on U.S. soil by a terrorist who gained entry to the United States through Mexico. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in Mexico in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There were no changes to Mexico's counterterrorism legislation in 2021. The government lacked adequate laws prohibiting material suppor t to terrorists and relied largely on counterterrorism regimes in other countries to thwart potential threats. U.S. law enforcement reported increased collaboration with Mexican authorities in 2021 to identify potential counterterrorism threats among the growing number of third -country nationals transiting Mexico. In October , the United States and Mexico launched the Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health, and Safe Communities to boost bilateral cooperation on law enforcement and border security, among other security matters. The Center for National Intelligence, housed within the Secretariat of Security and Citizen Protection, was the lead agency for detecting, deterring, and preventing terrorist threats in 2021. The Mexican Attorney General's Office was the lead agency for investigating and prosecuting terrorism - related offenses. Impunity remained a problem, with extremely low rates of prosecution for all crimes , including terrorism . Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Mexico is a member of FATF, as well as the GAFILAT, a FATF -style regional body. Mexico i s also a cooperating and supporting nation of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force and is an observer of the Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti -Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism (or MONEYVAL), two FATF -style regional bodies. The Financial Intelligence Unit -Mexico is a member of the Egmont Group and proactively shared financial intelligence on shared threats with its U.S. Department of the Treasury counterpart, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Mexico passed an expansive asset s forfeiture law in 2019, but in 2021 the Supreme Court declared civil asset forfeiture elements of the law unconstitutional. To date , Mexican prosecutors have not used the law to seize assets of illicit origin in a terrorism case. Countering Violent Extremism: There was no action in 2021 to establish official CVE policies, initiatives, or programs. International and Regional Cooperation: As a member of the UN Security Council (UNSC) for 2021 -22, Mexico led the adoption of a UNS C presidential statement in November on maintaining international peace and security through a holistic approach to countering terrorism. Mexico reiterated its commitment to counterterrorism efforts in 2021 at several UN discussions. It supports the UN G lobal Counter terrorism Strategy and has underscored the need to combat firearms trafficking to deprive terrorists of weapons. Mexico is a member of the OAS /Inter -American Committee Against Terrorism (OAS -CICTE). In October, Mexico became vice chair of the CICTE. PANAMA Overview: As Panama is a transit country for illicit goods, money, and migrants, its government's willingness to engage on bilateral and multilateral counterterrorism initiatives is critically important for regional security. Under President Laurentino \"Nito\" Cortizo, the Government of Panama (GoP) continued to cooperate with the United States on counterterrorism, especially through effective implementation of maritime -related provisions of UN and U.S. sanctions , including through revocation of the registry of vessels implicated in the evasion of sanctions . Since the beginning of 2021, the GoP has de -flagged dozens of ships for violating U.S. or UN sanctions. Through the Transnational Criminal Investigations Unit an d different partnerships, Panama cooperated with U.S. authorities on several CT -related cases in 2021 and continues to lead the region in enrollments in the Biometric Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program (BITMAP). However, Panama has been on the FATF gray list since 2019 for deficiencies in its anti -money laundering regime and has completed only nine of 15 items on its Action Plan. Panama remained the first and only Latin American member of the Defeat -ISIS Coalition and continues to be involved in the Coalition's Counterterrorism Finance Working Group. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorist incidents in 2021. Legi slation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Although Panama does not have comprehensive CT legislation or a robust CT legal framework, it has an executive decree to control dual -use goods and has adopted a national control list for dual -use goods consi stent with UNSCR 1540. Panama also has an executive decree to address chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear incidents. While the country does not have a formal coordinating authority on migration below the cabinet level, officials from the GoP' s National Security Council, National Border Service (SENAFRONT), National Migration Service (SNM), and National Police (PNP) met frequently among themselves and with U.S. government officials to efficiently coordinate and act on migration alerts and detai n and deport travelers who represented a security risk. Panama furthered its UNSCR 2396 obligations to collect biographic and biometric data, share information with regional partners, share advance passenger information, and participate in INTERPOL. A U.S.-Panama nian Joint Task force that shares information on Known and Suspected Terrorists (KSTs) and detain s and/or deport s them as needed cooperated on several CT -related cases. The task force continue d to process Panama's BITMAP data and provide intelligence information, analytical products, and migration trends to Panamanian officers. The GoP's biometric enrollments provide U.S. agencies with information on foreign partners' law enforcement and border encounters with KSTs, gang members, and other persons of interest. The Ministry of Security and the National Customs Authority (ANA) made progress to address the country's lack of cargo scanners. At the time of this report, the scanners project was in the final stages of approval, with a late 2022 anticipated delivery, leaving the ANA to rely heavily on just three Customs and Border Protection/Crime Scene Investigation scanners operating at the ports of Col \u00f3n and Balboa. The lack of scanners significantly limits the GoP's ability to analyze cargo transiting the country, including at Tocumen International Airport \u2014 which has the highest number of passenger movements in the region \u2014 and entry to and exit from the Col\u00f3n Free Trade Zone. Limited scanner capabilities, along with a lack of proper institutional and interagency protocols at ports, greatly increases the risk of illicit cargo transiting undetected to and through Panama. Current GoP efforts, supported by Embassy Pa nama City, will increase interagency information sharing and expand situational awareness in the land, air, and maritime border security environments. Panama continued to cooperate with U.S. law enforcement on ongoing counterterrorism cases this year, including investigations of individuals linked to Hizballah. However, the GoP's ability to investigate financial support to terrorist -related organizations remained limited. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Panama belongs to the Latin American Financial Action Task Force. One of the departments of Panama's FIU covers CFT -related reviews of information and prevention efforts. Panama belongs to the Egmont Group. The government is making slow progress to demonstrate effective supervision, information sharing, risk management, and prosecution of financial crimes as outlined in its FATF Action Plan. In 2021, the Panama Maritime Authority, which oversees the world's l argest ship registry, de - flagged dozens of ships for facilitating violations or evasion of U.S. or UN sanctions related to Iran, Venezuela, North Korea, Syria, and Cuba. For additional information on money laundering, see the 2021 INCSR, Vol. 2: Money Laundering . Countering Violent Extremism: There were no changes for 2021. International and Regional Cooperation: Panama continued working to strengthen its implementation of UN resolutions that promote the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The OAS Inter -American Committee Against Terrorism received funding from the Export Control and Related Border Security Program in 2021 to strengthen Panama's implementation of UNSCR 1540 and contribute to increasing the effectiveness of custom s administration in Panama. The project focuses on providing legislative assistance to help Panama comply with international instruments and obligations; promote outreach to the private sector, industry, and academia to increase awareness of potential proliferation risks; and build capacity to strengthen national capabilities to mitigate and combat potential risks. Funding in 2021 expanded on the initial program that focused on government representatives to support engagement with the private sector and industry, including the Authorized Economic Operator program and the Colon Free Trade Zone. Panama continued its active participation in regional security initiatives. The U.S. Department of State 's Office of Cooperative Threat Reduction and the U.S. Department of Ener gy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory hosted virtual workshops on CFT in Panama, focusing on proliferation financing and sanctions evasion. The workshops included detailed overviews of best practices for risk assessment and mitigation strategies for government regulators and representatives from the judicial sector. In 2021, Embassy Panama City carried out training for Panamanian prosecutors, judges, police, forensic experts, bank supervisors, stock market personnel, and Financial Analysis Unit staff on money -laundering investigation techniques, trade -based money laundering, and cryptocurrency as a method of money -laundering. PARAGUAY Overview: In 2021 , the Government of Paraguay continued to be a receptive partner on counterterrorism cooperation with the United States, though challenges stem from ineffective immigration, customs, financial, and law enforcement controls along its porous borders, particul arly the TBA with Argentina and Brazil, and its land border with Brazil from the TBA to Pedro Juan Caballero. Since 2008, persons claiming to be part of the Paraguayan People's Army (EPP) \u2014 a domestic criminal group initially dedicated to a socialist rev olution in Paraguay \u2014 have conducted violent acts meant to extort and intimidate the population and local governments in the northern departments of Concepc \u00edon, San Pedro, and Amambay. Paraguayan authorities officially consider the EPP and its offshoots \u2014 Mariscal L \u00f3pez's Army (EML), and the Armed Peasant Association (ACA), which reemerged in 2020 \u2014 as organized criminal groups rather than terrorist organizations. However, public discourse of Paraguayan leaders occasionally refers to them informally as t errorist organizations. The Government of Paraguay increased its Joint Task Force (FTC) presence in Concepcion Department following the EPP's 2020 kidnapping of former Vice President \u00d3scar Denis. The government has not located Denis , nor Felix Urbeita \u2014 the other hostage believed still to be in EPP custody \u2014 as of year's end. In 2021, attacks attributed to the EPP and its offshoots resulted in the deaths of three FTC soldiers, two police officers, and three civilians. The Government of Paraguay believes the EPP is a small, decentralized group of between 20 and 50 members. EPP, EML, and ACA's activities have consisted largely of isolated attacks on remote police and army posts, or against ranchers and peasants accused of aiding Paraguayan security forces. Ranchers and ranch workers in northeastern Paraguay , including members of the Mennonite community, claimed the EPP frequently threatened both their livelihoods and personal security. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: Terrorist incidents in Paraguay in 2021 included the following : On June 12, six EPP members attacked a farm in the Sargento Felix Lopez district in Concepc \u00edon Department, where they shot and killed Brazilian farmer Jonas Fernando Alves and wounded Elix Regina de Lima. On June 26, members of the EPP -ACA abducted Jorge Rios at gunpoint from his home in Sargento Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix L\u00f3pez district and demanded a USD $200,000 ransom from Rios' s family. On July 3 , Rios' s bullet -riddled body was found in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul. On July 29, three FTC soldiers were killed when their vehicle struck an IED planted by the EPP on a road on the border between Amambay and San Pedro departments. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The Paraguayan government continued to make use of a 2013 counterterrorism law that allows for the domestic deployment of the Paraguayan military to counter internal or external threats. The FTC, the joint task force charged with countering the EPP, consists of around 800 militar y, supported by 450 Paraguayan National Police (PNP) officers, as well as National Anti -Drug Secretariat personnel. The PNP Secretariat for the Prevention and Investigation of Terrorism officially handles counterterrorism functions, although other PNP uni ts and agencies such as the National Anti -Drug Secretariat work such cases as well, particularly when related to drug trafficking. In 2018, Paraguayan President Abdo Ben\u00edtez, inaugurated the new headquarters of the National Intelligence System (SINAI) ser vice, composed of the National Intelligence Council (CNI) and the National Intelligence Secretariat (SNI), which report directly to the president. The purpose of the SINAI is \"detecting, neutralizing , and counterbalancing the actions of domestic and international terrorist groups, and of transnational criminal organizations.\" The first meeting of the CNI took place in 2020 . In 2021, SNI continued to serve as Paraguay's lead authority for coordination of counterterrorism operations. Military forces and police officials continued to operate jointly in the San Pedro, Concepc \u00edon, and Amambay Departments against the EPP, with uneven success. On August 2 , the FTC conducted an operation that killed two EPP-affiliated members believed to be responsible for the kidnapping of a cattle rancher. In 2019 , Congress enacted Law 6379, which created a special court jurisdiction in economic and organized crime, inclu ding terrorism and terrorist financing. Article 1 created a new branch of the judiciary to adjudicate these cases to include drug trafficking, and specifically created judicial space for magistrate judges, trial courts, sentencing courts, and courts of appeal. Paraguay's Supreme Court issued Resolution 8153 and Resolution 8263 in 2020, to appoint specialized criminal justice magistrates to these courts. The Special Court for Economic Crimes began hearing cases in 2021 and obtained several notable convict ions, including the late former Senator \u00d3scar Gonz \u00e1lez Daher for illicit enrichment. The TBA has been attractive to individuals engaged in terrorist financing, as the ineffective \u2014 and often corrupt \u2014 police, military, customs, and migration agency pres ence along these borders allows for a largely unregulated flow of people, goods, and money. Paraguay's efforts to provide more effective law enforcement and border security suffered from a lack of interagency cooperation and information sharing, as well a s from pervasive corruption within security, border control, and judicial institutions. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Paraguay is a member of the Financial Action Task Force of Latin America (GAFILAT), a FATF -style regional body. Paraguay's FIU is a member of the Egmont Group. GAFILAT conducted its fourth -round mutual evaluation visit in September and coordinated additional information requests with relevant Paraguayan agencies throughout the remainder of the year. GAFILAT will issue its final mutual evaluation report in 2022. Paraguay has counterterrorist financing legislation and the ability to freeze and confiscate terrorist assets immediately, if requested to do so by another government. FATF experts noted that Paraguay pos sesses an adequate legal framework, while noting that Paraguay falls short on implementation. In particular, government agencies struggled to coordinate effectively to detect, deter, and prosecute money laundering and terrorism financing. Implementation of the packet of 12 draft laws to tighten counterterrorism finance enforcement, which passed in 2019, remained incomplete. The Paraguayan government registers and has reporting requirements for non -governmental organizations, including non -profit organiza tions , and mandates that NGOs set up internal monitoring and training to guard against criminal or terrorism financing. Paraguay also requires the collection of data for wire transfers. Despite these mechanisms, government agencies' efforts to enforce an ti-money laundering/counterterrorist financing laws continued to lag. For further information on money laundering and financial crimes, see the 2021 INCSR, Vol. 2: Money Laundering . Countering Violent Extremism: Paraguay had no CVE program in 2021. Police in Ciudad del Este (CDE) on the border with Brazil do regularly engage with the city's large Muslim population. CDE's Muslim community has not shown a history toward radicalization to violence ; however , the p olice also lack the training necessary to effectively identify and address signs of violent extremism or understand the nuances of Islamic religion and culture. International and Regional Cooperation: Paraguay continued to support counterterrorism efforts in regional and multilateral organizations. The country participated in the Organization of American States and its Inter -American Committee Against Terrorism . It continued to collaborate with Argentina and Brazil on border security initiatives, regional exchanges, and law enforcement projects, although the closure of borders during the COVID -19 pandemic hindered in-person exchanges. Argentina, Brazil, and Par aguay coordinated law enforcement efforts in the Tri -Border Area through their Trilateral Tri -Border Area Command. Paraguay remained a member of the Regional Security Mechanism (RSM) established in 2019. The RSM, which did not hold meetings in 2020 or 20 21 owing to the COVID -19 pandemic, aims to facilitate security coordination, including counterterrorism, between member states. In December, Paraguay's Interior Ministry signed an agreement with the Interior Ministries of Brazil and Uruguay to strengthen coordination against transnational organized criminal organizations through increased investigative cooperation and intelligence sharing. PERU Overview: The Peruvian National Police (PNP) and armed forces continued operations in 2021 targeting alleg ed Shining Path ( Sendero Luminoso , or SL) remnants. The government also continued investigating SL front organizations and its legal political branch, called the Movement for Amnesty and Fundamental Rights ( Movadef ). Virtual hearings in the terrorism trial against Muhammad Ghaleb Hamdar, a Lebanese citizen suspected of links to Hizballah, continued in 2021. The prosecution presented the testimony of an FBI Hizballah subject -matter expert to demonstrate common elements between the Hamdar case and another case successfully prosecuted in the United States. Hamdar's case is still pending witness testimony and closing arguments. If convicted, Hamdar would represent the first terrorism conviction of a Hizballah operative in South America. SL con tinued to operate in the Valley of the Rivers Apur\u00edmac, Ene, and Mantaro (VRAEM). Estimates vary, but most experts and the Peruvian security services assess SL remnants numbered between 250 and 300 members, including from 60 to as many as 150 armed fighte rs. SL collects \"revolutionary taxes\" from drug trafficking organizations operating in the area to support its terrorist activities. V\u00edctor Quispe Palomino (aka Camarada Jos\u00e9), a U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency Most Wanted Fugitive, leads SL's remnants in the VRAEM, which he calls the Militarized Communist Party of Peru (MPCP). Quispe allegedly oversees all MPCP illicit activities, including extortion, murder, and drug trafficking. SL founder Abimael Guzm\u00e1n died on September 11, at age 86 , while in a military prison near Lima. He and key accomplices were serving life sentences for terrorist acts conducted during the 1980s and 1990s. Peru's political establishment, including President Pedro Castillo, overwhelmingly welcomed the news of Guzm\u00e1n's passing and condemned terrorism more broadly. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: The overall number of terrorist attacks and deaths of security forces attributable to terrorism in Peru decreased in 2021 , compared with the previous year. During May 24-25, 16 local people were killed in the vicinity of San Miguel del Ene, in the Cusco Region 's La Convenci\u00f3n Province. The victims included four children . Pamphlets were found urging Peruvians not to participate in the 2021 presidential elections. The Peruvian government attributed the attack to SL remnants, although SL did not publicly take responsibility. During July 3 -4, SL remnants attacked military police in the vicinity of Pampa Aurora, in Ayacucho's Huanta Province, resulting in several injuries. On October 28, narcotraffickers, with ties to terrorism, attacked military police in the vicinity of Nueva Maravilla, in Ayacucho's Huanta Province. Government troops successfully rep ulsed the attack. On October 29, narcotraffickers, also with ties to terrorism, attacked a military patrol after being pulled over in their van in Santa Cruz de Llacchuas, in Ayacucho's Huanta Province. The assailants escaped but abandoned the van and more than 60 kilogram s of cocaine. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Peru adopted multiple counterterrorism laws over the past 30 years, and CT measures have broad public support. Enforcement of the COVID -19 pandemic national lockdown took a heavy toll on security forces' availability, but joint military and police teams completed 17 planned operations in 2021, including the following: On March 21 , a military patrol captured SL operative Marco Antonio D\u00edaz in Nuevo Unidos Tahuantinsuyo, in the Ucayali Region 's Padre Abad Province. On September 13 , a joint military and police patrol tracked down key SL logistician \"Camarada Hern\u00e1n,\" in Chibuco, in the Jun\u00edn Region 's Satipo Province. Hern\u00e1n was killed during the raid, and the patrol recovered comp uter equipment and other intelligence. On November 7 , a joint military and police patrol seized military equipment belonging to SL in Pachamarca District , in Huancavelica's Churcampa Province. The equipment included rifles, handguns, grenades, ammunition, 148 sticks of dynamite, and terrorist propaganda. On December 13 , a joint military police patrol seized military equipment belonging to SL in the vicinity of Libertad, in Jun\u00edn's Satipo Province. The equipment included hand grenades, dynamite, homemade explosives, detonators, firearm ammunition, and terrorist propaganda. Immigration authorities continued to collect biometric information from visitors at ports of entry to protect Peruvian border security. Visas were not required for visitors from Europe, Southeast Asia, or Central America (except El Salvador and Nicaragua). The United States and Peru have had a bilateral information sharing arrangement in place since 2019, which facilitates the exchange of terrorist screening information and complements other programs such as the DHS Automated Targeting System -Global. In 2021, Peru expanded its cooperation with the United States on the Biometric Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program, which offers the capability to search, enroll, and identify known or suspected terrorists, violent international gang members, and other individuals of interest by leveraging three key U.S. databases. The program also serves as a capacity building mechanism. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Peru is a member of GAFILAT, a FATF -style regional body. The FIU of Peru is a member of the Egmont Group. GAFILAT continues to address the technical compliance deficiencies identified in its 2018 Mutual Evaluation Report, and the FIU is i mplementing the Asset Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention System in the foreign exchange trading sector. Countering Violent Extremism: The government's multisectoral VRAEM 2021 Development Strategy, part of Peru's bicentennial vision, aims to foster alternative development and social inclusion and complements aggressive actions against SL terrorism, propaganda, and recruitment. The Ministry of Justice also continues to implement the 2005 Comprehensive Plan of Reparations for victims of violen ce between the armed forces and terrorist groups during the 1980s and 1990s, as part of Peru's national policy of peace, reconciliation, and reparation. International and Regional Cooperation: Peruvian officials participated in CT activities in interna tional organizations, including the UN, OAS -CICTE, the Union of South American Nations, and the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation. The PNP Counterterrorism Directorate also coordinated with police in other countries to track terrorist activities. TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO Overview: The threat from ISIS sympathizers in Trinidad and Tobago and the possible return of individuals who traveled, or attempted to travel, to Syria or Iraq to fight with ISIS is the primary terrorism concern in the country. Trinidad and Tobago and the United States continue to cooperate on counterterrorism investigations involving Trinidad and Tobago nationals. The Trinidad and Tobago Cabinet approved a policy to address the return and reintegration of its FTFs. The policy h as yet to be implemented and may require an amendment to the existing Trinidad and Tobago Antiterrorism Act. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no terrorism incidents reported in Trinidad and Tobago in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Trinidad and Tobago 's counterterrorism institutions continue to face challenges related to staffing, funding, and coordination. There were no arrests or prosecutions initiated against any terrorist groups or individuals suspected of terrorist a ctivity in 2021. The government is undertaking reforms, including the introduction of plea bargaining and judge - only trials, aimed at speeding up the lengthy judicial process. These developments may lead to increased prosecutions of serious crimes, incl uding terrorism. The Antiterrorism Amendment Bill 2021, which would govern the return and reentry of Trinidad and Tobago 's FTFs, remained pending at the end of 2021. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago remains reticent to accept returning FTFs and the ir families, frequently citing the need to balance the needs of individuals and national security. During the reporting period, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago passed legislation to meet additional FATF requirements and a new evidence act that allow s for the use of electronic evidence in court, including closed - circuit television footage. The government continues to convene an interagency taskforce, known as Taskforce Nightingale (TFN), which is charged with developing recommendations related to th e possible return of FTFs and others who have traveled to the Middle East and joined ISIS. The taskforce consists of various law enforcement, judicial, foreign affairs, defense force, and immigration and border protection officers. Separate from TFN, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago 's Interministerial Committee on Counterterrorism, tasked with implementing Trinidad and Tobago 's counterterrorism strategy, oversaw the development of the National Operations Fusion Center and the National Intelligence Fu sion Center. The Operations and Intelligence Centers became functional in 2021 and are tasked with coordinating the Government of Trinidad and Tobago 's counterterrorism operations. The government's willingness to allocate an annual budget that supports the implementation of its counterterrorism strategy will determine its success. Trinidad and Tobago 's institutions have demonstrated the capability to detect, deter, and prevent acts of terrorism with the assistance of international partners. The Trini dad and Tobago Police Service is the law enforcement agency with primary responsibility for investigating terrorism and terrorism finance cases. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago conducts vulnerability assessments on important structures such as stadia, airports, and monuments periodically. Trinidad and Tobago continues to participate in the Advance Passenger Information system and maintains a national watchlist of persons of int erest to national security, which can include persons suspected of engaging in terrorist activity. Nonetheless, Trinidad and Tobago 's southern border, which is approximately seven miles from the Venezuelan coast, remains porous and is vulnerable to drug a nd arms trafficking, human trafficking and smuggling, and illegal migration. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago continues to make positive strides on strengthening border security, including the commissioning of two new Cape -class patrol boats for the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard during the reporting period. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Trinidad and Tobago is a member of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force, a FATF -style regional body. Trinidad and Tobago 's FIU is a member of the E gmont Group. The government continues to carry out its international obligations under UNSC and FATF regulations on combating terrorism and terrorist financing. In March, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago undertook its second National Risk Assessm ent with technical assistance from the World Bank, which included a terrorist financing risk assessment. To date, under its Antiterrorism Act, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago has designated 494 individuals and entities and frozen their assets. In 2021, Trinidad and Tobago also approved a national action plan to combat the illicit trade in consumer goods. Countering Violent Extremism: While the Government of Trinidad and Tobago approved a policy to address the return and reintegration of its FTF s, implementation may require an amendment to the Trinidad and Tobago Antiterrorism Act. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago continues to partner with the International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism (ICSVE) to learn best practices in CVE. Trinidad and Tobago supported the ICSVE's \"Breaking the ISIS Brand in Trinidad\" project, including a social media engagement program in July that reached more than 94,000 people living in areas where most Trinidadian and Tobagonian ISIS fighters originated. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is also a member of a CVE working group in Port of Spain, the International Partners' Group, comprised of several diplomatic missions, including the United States, Canada, the EU, the UK, the Commonwealth Secretar iat, and the UN, to coordinate and collaborate on CVE efforts within the country. International and Regional Cooperation: Trinidad and Tobago is a member of the of the OAS Inter -American Committee Against Terrorism. The government continues to work wit h its Caribbean Community partners on counterterrorism issues. Trinidad and Tobago participated in the Second United Nations High -Level Conference of the Heads of Counterterrorism Agencies and Member States and the Seventh Review of the Global Counterterrorism strategy in June. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago 's Strategic Services Agency, its lead intelligence agency, hosted a virtual seminar on \"Challenges and Opportunities on Countering Terrorism and Preventing Violent Extremism in the Caribbean Post COVID -19\" in June for participants from local, regional, and international partn ers. VENEZUELA Overview: The United States recognizes the Interim Presidency of Juan Guaid\u00f3 and the 2015 National Assembly. Nicolas Maduro continues to claim to be the leader of Venezuela and retains control and the loyalty of the Venezuelan Armed Forces (FANB). Members of the Maduro regime continue to engage in criminal activities and members of several Colombian FTOs \u2014 including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -People's Army (FARC -EP), Segunda Marquetalia, and the National Liberation Army (ELN) \u2014 continue to operate in Venezuelan territory with relative impunity. Clashes among terrorist organizations and between these organizations and elements of the FANB increased in 2021, especially in Apure state, bordering Colombia. Nonetheless, ELN, FARC -EP, and Segunda Marqu etalia continued to expand their presence inside Venezuelan territory, according to local experts. On May 11, local NGO FundaRedes reported the presence of ELN in 17 of Venezuela's 23 states, as well as in the capital city of Caracas. FundaRedes reported FARC -EP and/or Segunda Marquetalia presence in 14 of the 23 states, as well as in Caracas. 2021 Terrorist Incidents: The regime's complicated relationship with terrorist groups continued to be characterized by both conflict and cooperation. The Venezue lan Armed Forces and the Venezuelan police Special Action Forces (FAES) began to clash more frequently with armed terrorist groups, especially with forces from the FARC -EP in Apure state led by Miguel Botache Fabian Gue vara Ferley). On February 15, the National Anti -Drug Office reported a clash between FAES and FARC -EP fighters that resulted in two FARC -EP killed, after the militants were reportedly caught unloading 192 cocaine pans in Mu\u00f1oz municipalit y, Apure state. One officer was injured, while another man was arrested by Venezuelan forces. On March 21, the FANB and FAES launched Operation Bolivarian Shield 2021 in Apure state to root out the presence of FARC -EP; however, some observers have publicly speculated that elements of the regime were acting in alliance with ELN and Segunda Marquetal ia to maintain control over lucrative smuggling routes. For more than two months, regime forces clashed with FARC -EP, resulting in at least 16 military casualties, 40 wounded, and 12 kidnapped by FARC -EP. The total number of casualties from the FARC -EP side remains uncertain, but Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, a regime member claiming to act as defense minister, said at least six were killed and another 30 detained. The FANB also reported dismantling nine camps, including one that produced cocaine. Local NGO s Provea and FundaRedes reported the extrajudicial killings of five Venezuelan citizens in Apure and 30 illegal detentions against regular citizens framed as members of irregular groups. These civil society groups alleged the FANB planted evidence to impl y unaffiliated civilians were involved with armed groups and to demonstrate false successes. On April 23, an estimated 300 FARC -EP fighters launched an ambush against 28 FANB soldiers and two helicopters in La Capilla town. NGO FundaRedes reported the de aths of 12 soldiers, later confirmed by a statement released by the FANB. Through a video recorded on May 4, presumably filmed under coercion, eight kidnapped FANB soldiers requested that Venezuelan authorities negotiate their release in exchange for not confronting the presence of the FARC -EP in Apure state. FundaRedes said in public statements that at least three encounters between the irregular group and Venezuelan authorities took place to discuss this proposal, but none were confirmed by the regime. On May 31, the FANB abruptly retreated from Apure. On June 1, the regime reported the release of the eight detained. On April 28, the interim government had passed a decree on the Apure events that accused the FANB of protecting Segunda Marquetalia, in violation of Venezuela's constitution and national security. Members of Segunda Marquetalia including one of its leaders, Jes\u00fas Santrich, were reportedly killed in Venezuelan territory in 2021. In December, Colombian Defense Minister Diego Andr\u00e9s Molano Venezuela. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There were no changes to Venezuela's counterterrorism legislation in 2021. The regime's usurpation of the judicial system and milit ary/security services for its own illicit ends, rampant public corruption, and cooperation with criminal elements continued to provide ideal conditions for illegal activity. The regime continued to target political dissidents and civil society groups usin g terrorism charges. In July, the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (called SEBIN) unjustly detained the founder and director of FundaRedes , Javier Tarazona, and two other FundaRedes members, Omar de Dios Garc\u00eda and Rafael Tarazona. The three were held incommunicado from family or legal representation, without specification from regime authorities of the reason for their arrest, according to public reporting and Amnesty International . The trio subsequently were charged with treason, terrorism, and incitement of hatred in the \"Third Control Court for Terrorism.\" Garc\u00eda and Rafael Tarazona were released on October 26, while Javier Tarazona remains in prison. The detention of Tarazona is linked directly to his work covering the Apure events. Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Venezuela is a member of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF). Venezuela's FIU is a member of the Egmont Group. In 2021, the Maduro regime tried to implement new legal means to monitor and control human rights and humanitarian organization s under the guise of \"antiterrorism\" measures. In March, the Maduro regime published Administrative Ruling 001 -2021, which requires NGOs to register with the Office Against Organized Crime and Terrorism Financing (or ONCDOFT). Upon registration, NGOs are required to provide documents such as their articles of incorporation, bylaws, a list of national and international donors, a list of their overseas headquarters, and a list of all beneficiaries of their services. The regime pointed to CFATF recommendat ion 8, which requires that the laws and regulations that govern NGOs be reviewed so they cannot be used for the financing of terrorism, as the reason for the new requirement. NGOs objected to the new requirement, noting it held a base assumption that crim inalized the work of NGOs by forcing them to register with an agency intended for antiterrorism efforts. In April, more than 700 civil society organizations denounced Administrative Ruling 001 -2021 as unconstitutional and cited as dangerous the need to su pply the regime with a list of their beneficiaries. In May, the requirement was amended and replaced by Administrative Ruling 002 -2021 , which excluded the need for a list of beneficiaries and lessened the penalties for noncompliance. The timeline to adhe re to the new requirement also was changed, although the deadline for registering remained unclear. NGOs reported that compliance was not enforced in 2021. Countering Violent Extremism: There were no known CVE efforts under way in 2021. Internat ional and Regional Cooperation: Analysts continued to warn of increasing ties between the regime and Iran. Flights between both nations continued using sanctioned airlines Conviasa and Qeshm Fars Air, with reports that the flights may have been used to s huttle oil production materials and unspecified military equipment. In June, two ships that departed from Bandar -e Abbs port in Iran were thought to be headed to Venezuela carrying weapons, before they diverted to Russia late in their journey. On Octob er 18, regime Foreign Minister Felix Plasencia visited Iran and met with President Ebrahim Raisi. The two sides reported discussing strategic relations as well as a roadmap for the two countries' relations over the next 20 years. Plasencia announced Madu ro's intention to visit Iran in 2022. Chapter 2. State Sponsors of Terrorism This report provides a snapshot of events during 2021 relevant to countries designated as State Sponsors of Terrorism. It does not constitute a new announcement regarding such designations. To designate a country as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, the Secretary of State must determine that the government of such country has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism. Once a co untry is designated, it remains a State Sponsor of Terrorism until the designation is rescinded in accordance with statutory criteria requiring the President to certify either a) that a designated country has not provided any support for acts of internatio nal terrorism during the previous six months and has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future, or b) that there has been a fundamental change in the leadership and policies of the designated country, that t he country is not supporting acts of international terrorism, and that the country has provided assurances it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future. A wide range of sanctions is imposed because of a State Sponsor of Terrorism desi gnation, including the following: A ban on arms -related exports and sales. Controls over exports of dual -use items, requiring 30 -day Congressional notification for goods or services that could significantly enhance the terrorist -list country's military capability or ability to support terrorism. Restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance. Visa processing requirements. Imposition of miscellaneous financial and other restrictions. CUBA On January 12, 2021, the Department of State designated Cuba as a St ate Sponsor of Terrorism. The Secretary determined that the Cuban government repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism in granting safe harbor to terrorists. Cuba was previously designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1982 because of its long history of providing advice, safe haven, communications, training, and financial support to guerrilla groups and individual terrorists. Cuba's designation was rescinded in 2015 after a thorough review found that Cuba met the statutory criteria for rescission. In 2021, the Secretary of State determined that Cuba had repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism since its State Sponsor of Terrorism designation had been rescinded in 2015. Citing peace negotiation protoc ols, Cuba refused Colombia's request to extradite 10 ELN leaders living in Havana after that group claimed responsibility for the 2019 bombing of a Bogot\u00e1 police academy that killed 22 people and injured 87 others. The Cuban government did not formally re spond to the extradition requests for ELN leaders Victor Orlando (aka \"Pablo Tejada\") and Ram\u00edrez Pineda (aka \"Pablo Beltr\u00e1n\") filed by Colombia. Cuba also harbors several U.S. fugitives from justice wanted on charges related to political violence , many of whom have resided in Cuba for decades. For example, the Cuban regime refused to return Joanne Chesimard, aka Assata Shakur, a fugitive on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists List, who was convicted of murdering New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foers ter. Cuba also refused to return William \"Guillermo\" Morales, a fugitive bomb maker for the Armed Forces for National Liberation, who is wanted by the FBI and escaped detention after his conviction on charges related to domestic terrorism; Ishmael LaBeet, aka Ishmael Muslim Ali, who received eight life sentences after being convicted of killing eight persons in the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1972 and hijacking a plane to flee to Cuba in 1984; Charles Lee Hill, who has been charged with killing New Mexico State Policeman Robert Rosenbloom in 1971; Ambrose Henry Montfort, who used a bomb threat to hijack a passenger aircraft and fly to Cuba in 1983; and V\u00edctor Manuel Gerena, a Puerto Rican militant who stole $7 million in a bank heist. DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REP UBLIC OF KOREA On November 20, 2017, the Secretary of State designated the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. The Secretary determined that the DPRK government repeatedly provided support for acts of internatio nal terrorism, as the DPRK was implicated in assassinations on foreign soil. The DPRK was previously designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1988 primarily because of its involvement in the 1987 bombing of a Korean Airlines passenger flight. The DPRK's designation was rescinded in 2008 after a thorough review found th at North Korea met the statutory criteria for rescission. In 2017, the Secretary of State determined the DPRK had repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism si nce its State Sponsor of Terrorism designation was rescinded in 2008. The DPRK also has failed to take action to address historical support for acts of international terrorism. Four Japanese Red Army members wanted by the Japanese government for particip ating in a 1970 Japan Airlines hijacking continue to shelter in the DPRK. The Japanese government also continues to seek a full accounting of the fate of numerous Japanese nationals believed to have been abducted by DPRK state entities in the 1970s and 19 80s; only five such abductees have been repatriated to Japan since 2002. IRAN Designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1984, Iran continued its support for terroris t- related activity in 2021, including support for Hizballah, Palestinian terrori st groups in Gaza, and various terrorist and militant groups in Iraq, Syria, Bahrain, and elsewhere throughout the Middle East. Iran used the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps -Qods Force (IRGC -QF) to provide support to terrorist organizations, provide cov er for associated covert operations, and create instability in the region. Iran has acknowledged the involvement of the IRGC -QF in the Iraq and Syria conflicts, and the IRGC -QF is Iran's primary mechanism for cultivating and supporting terrorist activity abroad. In 2019, the Secretary of State designated the IRGC, including IRGC - QF, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Iran also used regional militant and proxy groups to provide deniability, in an attempt to shield it from accountability for its destabil izing policies. In Iraq, Iran supported various Iran -aligned militia groups in 2021, including the U.S. Asa'ib -Haq, with sophisticated weapons \u2014 including increasingly accu rate and lethal unmanned aerial systems (UAS) \u2014 support, funding, and training. These groups conducted roughly two dozen rocket and UAS attacks on U.S. and coalition facilities across Iraq in 2021. These included rocket attacks on U.S. Embassy Baghdad on January 22 and July 8; explosive UAS attacks on U.S. facilities in Erbil on February 15, April 14, and July 6; and multiple attacks in June on U.S. and coalition forces at Ain Al -Assad Airbase. Additionally, Iran -aligned militia groups conducted an explo sive UAS attack on PM Kadhimi's residence on November 6. Iran also bolstered terrorist groups operating in Syria, including Hizballah, which has provided significant support to the Assad regime. Iran views the Assad regime in Syria as a crucial ally and Iraq and Syria as vital routes through which to supply weapons to Hizballah, Iran's primary terrorist proxy group. Iranian forces have directly backed militia operations in Syria with artillery, rockets, drones, and armored vehicles. Through financial or residency enticements, Iran has facilitated and coerced primarily Shia fighters from Afghanistan and Pakistan to participate in the Assad regime's brutal crackdown in Syria. These Iran -aligned forces conducted an attack on U.S. forces at Al -Tanf, Syria , on October 20. Since the end of the 2006 Israeli -Hizballah conflict, Iran has supplied Hizballah in Lebanon with thousands of rockets, missiles, and small arms in violation of UNSCR 1701. Israeli security officials and politicians expressed concerns that Iran was supplying Hizballah with advanced weapons systems and technologies, as well as assisting the group in creating infrastructure that would permit it to indigenously produce rockets and missiles to threaten Israel from Lebanon and Syria. Iran h as provided hundreds of millions of dollars in support of Hizballah and trained thousands of its fighters at camps in Iran. Hizballah fighters have been used extensively in Syria to support the Assad regime. In 2021, Iran continued providing weapon s systems and other support to Hamas and other U.S. - designated Palestinian terrorist groups, including Palestine Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine -General Command. These groups were behind numerous deadly attacks originating in Gaza and the West Bank. In Bahrain, Iran has continued to provide weapons, support, and training to local Shia militant groups, including the al -Ashtar Brigades and Saraya al -Mukhtar, both U.S. -designated terrorist groups. In Yemen, Iran has provided a wide range of weapons, training, advanced equipment such as unmanned aerial systems, and other support to Houthi militants, who engaged in hundreds of attacks against regional targets in Saudi Arabia. In May and December, the U.S. Navy and partner forces interdicted dhows carrying Iran -origin weapons intended for the Houthis, including hundreds of heavy machine guns and sniper rifles; dozens of advanced, Russian -made anti-tank guided missiles; several hundred rocket -propelled grenade launchers and optical sights for weapons; and thousands of assault rifles. In 2021, Iranian forces attacked several commercial ships in the Gulf of Oman, including an April 13 attack on the Hyperion Ray and a July 29 UAS attack on the Mercer Stree t vessel. Iran pursued or supported terrorist attacks against Israeli targets in 2021, including a thwarted January plot to attack an Israeli embassy in East Africa, a January bomb attack outside the Israeli embassy in New Delhi for which the Indian gover nment said the IRGC -QF was responsible, and a disrupted attempt to attack an Israeli businessman in Cyprus in October. Senior al -Qa'ida (AQ) members continued to reside in the country, and Iran has refused to publicly identify members it knows to be livin g in Iran. Iran has allowed AQ facilitators to operate a core facilitation pipeline through Iran since at least 2009, enabling AQ to move funds and fighters to South Asia and Syria, among other locales. As in past years, the Iranian government continued supporting terrorist plots or associated activities targeting Iranian dissidents. In recent years, Albania, Belgium, and the Netherlands have all either arrested or expelled Iranian government officials implicated in various terrorist plots in their resp ective territories. Denmark similarly recalled its ambassador from Tehran after learning of an Iran -backed plot to kill an Iranian dissident in Denmark . In 2021, the United States disrupted an Iranian intelligence network plot to kidnap Masih Alinejad, a n Iranian American journalist and human rights advocate living in Brooklyn, New York, from within the United States. The plot entailed luring Alinejad to a third country to capture her and forcibly render her to Iran. An Iranian plot to kidnap an Iranian helicopter pilot from T\u00fcrkiye was also reportedly foiled by Turkish authorities. SYRIA Designated in 1979 as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, Syria continued its political and military support to various terrorist groups. The regime continued to provide weapons and political support to Hizballah and continued to allow Iran to rearm and finance the terrorist organization. The Assad regime's relationship with Hizballah and Iran remained strong in 2021 , as the regime continued to rely heavily on external ac tors to fight opponents and secure areas. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps remains present and active in the country with the permission of President Bashar al -Assad. Assad remained a staunch defender of Iran's policies, while Iran exhibited equally energetic support for the Syrian regime. Syrian government speeches and press releases often included statements supporting terrorist groups, particularly Hizballah, and vice versa. Over the past two decades, the Assad regime's permissive attitude towa rd AQ and other terrorist groups' foreign terrorist fighter facilitation efforts during the Iraq conflict fed the growth of AQ, ISIS, and affiliated terrorist networks inside Syria. The Syrian government's awareness and encouragement for many years of ter rorists' transit through Syria to Iraq for the purpose of fighting U.S. forces before 2012 is well documented. The Assad regime released thousands of violent extremists from its prisons in 2011 and 2012, fueling a rise in terrorism within the country, in an attempt to justify its repression of the Syrian people and fracture international support for the Syrian opposition. Those very networks were among the terrorist elements that brutalized the Syrian and Iraqi populations in recent years. Throughout the Syrian conflict, terrorist groups in Syria have often cited the regime's egregious human rights abuses and violations to justify their activities and recruit members. The Assad regime has frequently used counterterrorism laws and special counterterrorism courts to detain and imprison protesters, human rights defenders, humanitarian workers, and others on the pretext of fighting terrorism. Additionally, Iran -aligned militia groups from Iraq, some of which are U.S. - designated terrorist organizations, conti nued to travel to Syria to fight on behalf of the Assad regime. Affiliates of the Kurdistan Workers' Party also operated on Syrian soil and represent T\u00fcrkiye 's primary counterterrorism concern in Syria. ISIS cells remained active in parts of Syria and launched attacks on civilians and U.S. partner forces. In 2019, U.S. forces completed an operation that resulted in the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al -Baghdadi. ISIS members in Syria continued to plot or inspire external terrorist operations. As part of a broader strategy used throughout the past decade, the regime continued to portray Syria itself as a victim of terrorism, characterizing all internal armed opposition members as \"terrorists.\" Chapter 3. The Global Challenge of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, or Nuclear Terrorism The use of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) materials and expertise remained a credible terrorist threat in 2021. As a countermeasure to this threat, the United States published a National Strateg y for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Terrorism in 2018 and continues to work proactively to disrupt and deny ISIS and other nonstate actors' CBRN capabilities. The international community has established numerous international partnerships to counter the CBRN threat from terrorists and other nonstate actors. The United States routinely provides technical and financial assistance as well as training to international organizations and partner nations to help strengthen their abil ities to protect and secure CBRN -applicable expertise, technologies, and material. Efforts to address CBRN terrorist threats through UNSCR 1540 and the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism are detailed in Chapter 4. The United States is an act ive member of the Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction (GP), launched in 2002 to prevent terrorists \u2014 and states that support them \u2014 from acquiring or developing WMD. Today, the G -7-led GP has expanded its mem bership to 30 countries and the European Union, sustaining a vital forum for countries to exchange information on national priorities for CBRN programmatic efforts worldwide, assess the threat landscape, share best practices, and coordinate assistance for these efforts. The United States continues to support the International Atomic Energy Agency's Division of Nuclear Security, which helps member states develop the capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to threats of nuclear terrorism through the de velopment of internationally accepted guidance, as well as the provision of training, technical advice and assistance, peer reviews, and other advisory services. Through the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation (ISN), the Office of Wea pons of Mass Destruction Terrorism (WMDT), the Office of Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR), the Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) program, and the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund, the Department of State coordinates its programming i nternally with other U.S. government agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Agriculture. In 2021, WMDT undertook multiple bilateral and multilateral capacity building assistance project s and activities with priority foreign partners. These included several workshops with Nigerian law enforcement and laboratory stakeholders to examine chemical weapon sampling and analysis methods and techniques. WMDT also provided law enforcement offici als from Algeria, Iraq, and Jordan training to enhance their capabilities to identify potential terrorist chemical and biological attack tripwires. In addition, WMDT supported the development and execution of virtual engagements that advanced multilateral programming and policy priorities. These promoted international adherence to and implementation of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, strengthened burden sharing with partner nations, and addressed global radio logical, chemical, and biological terrorism threats. ISN's Global Threat Reduction Program (GTR), managed by CTR, continued its work to prevent states and terrorist groups from acquiring or proliferating WMD to attack the United States. In 2021, GTR's chemical, biological, and nuclear security programs engaged with hundreds of foreign partners through virtual trainings to strengthen capacities to detect and counter WMD terrorism threats. In Iraq, GTR provided virtual training on advanced CBRN inc ident management to the Government of Iraq and Kurdistan Regional Government CBRN teams to ensure the whole of Iraq is prepared to respond to any potential chemical or biological attacks. In response to the threat of transnational terrorists using unrestr icted, commercially available material to conduct chemical weapons (CW) attacks, GTR collaborated with security forces around the world to train law enforcement in partner countries to detect and prevent CW attacks against vulnerable transportation hubs, s uch as railways and subways, and trained partners in academia, industry, and the transport sector to secure chemicals in their custody against malicious access. GTR's biosecurity programming continues to support partner capacity to prevent, detect, an d respond to outbreaks of high -consequence pathogens \u2014 whether intentional, accidental, or natural. GTR worked to strengthen coordination and information sharing between and among ministries as well as security and research sectors to enhance detection an d response to outbreaks and bioweapon attacks. The program continued to work with government, industry, and academic personnel through virtual engagements in Egypt, Jordan, Libya, Nigeria, the Philippines, and other countries to promote the adoption of se curity measures to prevent individuals or nonstate actors from acquiring weaponizable chemical, biological, and nuclear material and technology. The Department of State's EXBS program funds capacity building programs aimed at strengthening legal and re gulatory systems, developing licensing tools, enhancing border security and trade enforcement, providing outreach to key industrial and business sectors, and encouraging information sharing within governments and across national borders. As part of a core national security strategy to counter terrorist organizations, a key objective of EXBS is to provide stakeholders with substantive knowledge, skills, and tools to prevent state and nonstate actors from acquiring WMD, explosives, and conventional arms (inc luding Man -portable Air Defense Systems and Antitank Guided Missiles ) or using those materials against U.S. citizens and interests. To achieve this objective, EXBS continued to train partner governments in the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, Centra l Asia, East Asia, and Western Hemisphere regions to detect, interdict, and counter the materials, technologies, and tactics that terrorists could use to carry out low -technology attacks on public transportation. Additionally, in 2021, EXBS began implem enting curricula for partner nation security forces to address threats posed by improvised threats, including the use of drones as delivery mechanisms and insider threats focused on the commercial aviation sector. The program also provided comprehensive t raining to Middle Eastern and North African border security officials on cargo and passenger interdiction, border security, and counter -IED training. EXBS partnered with the CT Bureau and the interagency to engage with key partners on aviation security programming. Finally, EXBS and the CT Bureau furnished equipment and training to strengthen aviation security and mitigate threats to civilian aviation, and provided land border security training for Egyptian, Iraqi, and Libyan security forces to stem the f low of illicit materials and maintain gains made against ISIS and other nonstate actors. The Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund (NDF), in collaboration with EXBS, is supporting the expansion of the World Customs Organization's (WCO's) Program Global S hield. With NDF's support, the WCO will 1. Cultivate foreign partners' analytical capabilities to monitor illicit trade in chemical explosives precursors through risk -based targeting profiles. 2. Conduct tactical operations to test participating countries' ca pabilities to detect and interdict such trade. 3. Provide training and equipment to sustain national -level targeting, detection, interdiction, and investigation of illicit chemical transfers. The U.S. government continues to work with the interagency and partners to take steps to address the global challenge of chemical terrorism at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Such steps include measures aimed at facilitating OPCW Technical Secretariat (TS) access to ad ditional response tools against chemical weapons use, including by nonstate actors. U.S. efforts also include ensuring appropriate funding for the OPCW's Investigation and Identification Team, which is responsible for identifying individuals or entities i nvolved in the use of chemical weapons in certain cases, regardless of whether the perpetrators are state or nonstate actors. The U.S. government is also working on developing OPCW States Parties capacity to safely analyze and identify chemicals that wo uld be used in an attack, including by nonstate actors, and determine the likely provenance of such chemical weapons agents. The Forensic Science Centre of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is, for example, working with the National Laboratory of Mor occo as part of an OPCW labs twinning program. In 2021, U.S. government experts helped draft indicative guidelines for OPCW States Parties on how to secure their chemical value chain, including from nefarious nonstate actors. The Department of State's Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund also provided funding and personal protective equipment to support the OPCW TS's special missions and contingency operations related specifically to Syria through the OPCW's Trust Fund for Syria Missions. Finally, the U .S. Government is studying the possibility of assisting African and Southeast Asian countries vulnerable to terrorism with developing chemical protection plans in line with requirements of Article X of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Chapter4.Terrori stSafeHavens(Update to 7120 Report) Terrorist safe havens described in this report include ungoverned, undergoverned, and ill - governed physical areas where terrorists are able to organize, plan, raise funds, communicate, recruit, train, transit, and operate in relative security because of inadequate governance capacity, political will, or both. As defined by section 2656f(d) of Title 22 of the U.S. Code, the terms \"terrorist sanctuary\" and \"sanctuary\" exclude the territory of a country the government of which is subject to a determination under section 4605(j)(1)(A) of Title 50 [deemed under Section 1768(c)(2) of the NDAA of FY 2019 to refer to section 1754(c) of the NDAA FY19 as of August 13, 2018]; section 2371(a) of Title22; or sect ion 2780(d) of Title 22. (For information regarding the DPRK, Iran, and Syria, seeChapter2, State Sponsors of Terrorism.) TerroristSafeHavens Africa Somalia. Many parts of Somalia, particularly Somaliland and the Juba River Valley, remained terro rist safe havens in 2021 because federal and local authorities had a limited ability to project influence beyond populated areas and some forward operating bases. Al-Shabaab raised much of its funds by extorting people in ungoverned areas of Somalia. According to independent sources and non -governmental organizations engaged in demining activities on the ground, there was little cause for concern regarding the presence of WMD in Somalia. The Lake Chad Region. In 2021, Boko Haram (BH) and ISIS-West Afric a (ISIS - WA) maintained safe havens in parts of northeastern Nigeria and on islands in Lake Chad, preventing the reestablishment of state administration, service delivery, and humanitarian relief in broader territory surrounding Lake Chad. While BH's terro rist safe havens have been reduced owing in large part to the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) and clashes with ISIS -WA, ISIS-WA has continued to extend its reach, battling both government forces and those of BH. Forces from Nigeria and other member s of the MNJTF (Benin, Cameroon, Chad, and Niger) continued to combat both terrorist groups, but still lack the ability to clear safe havens or to secure borders and hold and effectively administer territory regained from the militants. ISIS-WA continues to conduct \u2014 through suicide bombers, vehicle -borne IEDs, raids, ambushes, kidnappings, and other means \u2014 asymmetric attacks against civilians, military, and government personnel. It funds itself primarily by \"taxing\" local populations, kidnapping for ransom, and looting material. In February, BH militants fired a series of rocket -propelled grenades in Maid uguri, Nigeria, killing at least 10 people. In April, a heavily armed ISIS -WA group killed 33 soldiers at a Nigerian base, destroyed a main battle tank, and stole several other military vehicles. When soldiers arrived in response to the attack, ISIS -WA a mbushed the reinforcements. This attack was followed by a series of attacks throughout Yobe State in Nigeria's Northwest. The next month, ISIS -WA attacked and overran BH's bases in the Sambisa Forest, resulting in the death of BH's leader, Abubakar Sheka u. Numerous BH militants reportedly joined ISIS -WA following Shekau's death, but BH remnants remain active around Lake Chad. No government in the Lake Chad region was known to support or facilitate the proliferation or trafficking of WMD in or through it s territory. The Trans -Sahara. In 2021, AQ affiliate Jamaat including ISIS-Greater Sahara , continued to stage asymmetric attacks in the Trans - Sahara region, expanding and consolidating areas under their control and preventing effective government provision of services. These terrorist groups have freedom of movement throughout Mali and Burkina Faso, except for major cities. JNIM continued to conduct large -scale attacks and massacres, expanding its operational footprint and capabilities, with JNIM alone responsible for more than 500 incidents in 2021. JNIM's success attracts support from other regional terrorist groups, including Nigeria -based and AQ -aligned Ansaru. JNIM continued to insert itself into longstanding conflicts such as the Fulani -herder -versus -Dogon -farmer conflict over water and grazing land. Vast swaths of Mali's territ ory \u2014 particularly in the country's northern region and along its eastern borders with Niger and Burkina Faso \u2014 remained effectively ungoverned in 2021. In these spaces, terrorist networks, including groups linked to JNIM and ISIS -Greater Sahara, have taken root and exploited the lack of state presence to plan and conduct operations and to recruit operatives. The area where terrorist groups can operate freely continues to grow and, over the last year, extends south along the Burkinabe border to C \u00f4te d'Ivo ire. No government in the region was known to support or facilitate the proliferation or trafficking of WMD in or through its territory, although the region remained prone to arms and munitions smuggling. Mozambique: The Islamic State in Mozambique (ISI S-M), was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) by the United States in March. ISIS -M continued attacks in Cabo Delgado and Niassa Provinces in northern Mozambique and expanded into Mtwara, Tanzania. Mozambique, Rwanda, and the South Africa n Development Community (SADC) coordinated a response to the threat in July, which resulted in an increase in ISIS -M events against state forces. This was the first year in which most ISIS -M activity were clashes with state/external forces rather than att acks against civilians. In March, ISIS -M attacked the town of Palma, the administrative capital of Palma District, and the northernmost district bordering Tanzania in Cabo Delgado Province (CDP). This was ISIS - M's first attack on the district capital, an d the city was under siege from the FTO until April. ISIS-M activity in Palma and Nangade during the first five months of 2021 surpassed the total number of events in 2020, indicating a geographic shift northward of ISIS -M's attacks in CDP when compared w ith its activity in previous years. In July, the Rwanda Defense Force (RDF) completed its deployment of special forces and police to CDP. In addition, elements from Botswana, South Africa, and Angola arrived under the auspices of the SADC Standby Force m ission to Mozambique to counter ISIS -M. By September, Mozambican security forces (FDS) and RDF troops continued small -scale clearing operations, including maritime interdictions, against retreating ISIS -M fighters in CDP. The FDS and RDF, with support fr om the SADC Standby Force, also began to conduct counter -ISIS-M operations in Niassa Province, which borders CDP to the West. While coordinated regional forces enjoyed some success in containing ISIS -M in CDP, ISIS -M attacked several villages in the Mecul a and Marrupa districts in neighboring Niassa Province beginning in November. During a December attack, heavily armed insurgents killed a civilian and razed houses and cars in several villages south of Mecula town in Niassa Province. Throughout the year, there were 384 ISIS -M events with a total of 1,127 fatalities among civilians, state forces, and ISIS -M militants. The government was not known to support or facilitate the proliferation or trafficking of WMD in or through its territory. Sudan. Sudan's extensive and porous borders and physical location continue to make the country a potential gateway for linking violent extremist activities in the region. Though Sudan has in general endeavored to tighten its border control measures, cont inued illicit and unmonitored movement across the borders is likely. The results of the autumn counterterrorism raids surfaced primarily foreign terrorists, speaking to terrorists' continued ability to use Sudan as a logistical and facilitation hub. The government was not known to support or facilitate the proliferation or trafficking of WMD in or through its territory. Southeast Asia The Southern Philippines. The Philippine government closely tracked terrorist groups that continued to operate in some a reas, particularly in the southern Philippines. The government sustained aggressive military and law enforcement operations to deny safe haven to such groups and prevent the flow of FTFs through its territory. The government further deepened close counte rterrorism cooperation with the United States, enhancing military and law enforcement efforts to address the full spectrum of terrorist threats, including from WMD. Although the Philippine government possesses the political will to apply security measures against terrorist threats and has consistently partnered with the United States and other nations to build the capacity to do so, it is still working to apply a coordinated whole -of-government approach to counter terrorism and prevent the Philippines from being used as a terrorist safe haven. The continued ability of terrorist organizations to operate in the southern Philippines reflects the centuries -long challenge of governing effectively in the country's more remote areas and of establishing consistent security in a region characterized by a strong separatist identity, endemic poverty, and religious differences. The government was not known to support or facilitate the proliferation or trafficking of WMD in or through its territory. The Sulu/Sulawesi Seas Littoral. The Government of Indonesia conducts monitoring and surveillance of suspected terrorist cells in its territory but acknowledges that a lack of resources hinders its ability to monitor potential terrorist activity in maritime a nd remote parts of Indonesia, including the Sulu and Sulawesi Seas. The Malaysian government sustained efforts to deny terrorists use of the Sulu/Sulawesi Seas as a safe haven by working with Indonesia and the Philippines to prevent the flow of incoming a nd outgoing foreign terrorists throughout its territory. Malaysian authorities reported that information sharing with the Philippines resulted in the arrests and deportation of suspected Abu Sayyaf Group members in May 2021. The governments were not know n to support or facilitate the proliferation or trafficking of WMD in or through their territories. The Middle East and North Africa Sinai Peninsula. In 2021, ISIS -Sinai Province (ISIS -SP) continued to conduct IED, sniper, and small -arms attacks against security forces and pro -government Bedouin groups, predominately in a small northern strip of the Sinai Peninsula. ISIS -SP also kidnapped and assassinated civilians who were collaborating with Egyptian security forces. Egyptian security operations that l ed to the March death of a senior ISIS -SP commander, the September high -profile defection of a prominent ISIS -SP religious figure (reportedly behind the deadly 2017 al -Rawda Mosque attack), and increasing rank -and-file ISIS -SP defections coincided with a significant decrease in the frequency and complexity of ISIS -SP attacks across the Sinai \u2014 less than half the rate of 2020. The Government of Egypt continued its wider counterterrorism strategy of infrastructure, development, and humanitarian projects on the Sinai Peninsula, spending hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years to compensate North Sinai residents for houses or land lost or damaged in counterterrorism operations, payments to the families of those killed and injured, and for medical aid a nd social assistance. North Sinai residents have filed grievances about compensation calculations and disbursements. Egypt continued to partner with U.S. counterterrorism efforts and support measures to prevent the proliferation and trafficking of WMD. The government was not known to support or facilitate the proliferation or trafficking of WMD in or through its territories. The United States has supported Egypt's efforts to combat ISIS -SP and other terrorist groups in Egypt by providing mine -resistant and ambush -protected vehicles, counter -IED and counter - sniper training, rotary and fixed -wing surveillance and transport aircraft, mobile sensor towers, and F -16s and AH -64 Apache helicopters (both of which conduct airstrikes against ISIS -SP). The United States routinely engages in military -to-military discussions on how it can help Egypt defeat ISIS -SP and other terrorist groups in Egypt, including at the U.S -Egypt Military Cooperation Committee in September and the U.S. -Egypt Strategic Dialogue in Novemb er. Iraq. Iran-backed -Haq, Kata'ib Hizballah, and Harakat al -Nujaba \u2014 all U.S. - designated terrorist organizations \u2014 and other Iran -backed Iraqi militias continued to maintain an active presence in Iraq targeting U.S., Global Coalition to De feat ISIS, and Iraqi forces and logistics convoys. These groups claimed responsibility for multiple attacks on U.S. interests, including Embassy Baghdad, throughout the year . Terrorists conducted more than 100 IED attacks on Defeat -ISIS-contracted convoy s and launched at least 40 indirect fire attacks against U.S. interests in Iraq. Iran -aligned militias launched several drone and rocket attacks against Erbil Air Base during the year and killed a U.S. contractor with a rocket attack in February. While I SIS has been defeated territorially and its leadership ranks have been significantly degraded, the group remains a serious threat to the stability of Iraq and to U.S. and Defeat -ISIS Coalition interests in the region. Methods of attack included bombings, indirect fire, IEDs, sniper fire, and ambushes. ISIS fighters continue to wage a low -level insurgency in northern and central Iraq, seeking to regain territory while also endorsing violence abroad through ISIS's branches and networks and inspiring lone -actor attacks. Supported by the 85 -mem ber Defeat - ISIS Coalition, the Government of Iraq maintained nominal control of the territory retaken from ISIS. ISIS continued to carry out assassinations, as well as suicide, hit -and-run, and other asymmetric attacks throughout the country. The United States continued to engage with Iraqi government officials, including officials in the Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government , to deny ISIS access to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CB RN) materials, including in areas with reduced government regulatory control over and/or law enforcement access to CBRN facilities and enterprises. The United States worked to strengthen the expertise and ability of Iraq's government, academic institution s, and private sector to secure weaponizable chemical and biological materials and to detect, disrupt, and respond effectively to suspected CBRN activity. The United States and Iraq also maintain a bilateral partnership to counter nuclear smuggling under the framework of the 2014 Joint Action Plan on Combating Nuclear and Radioactive Materials Smuggling. Lebanon. Lebanon remained a safe haven for terrorist groups, including in Hizballah -run areas. Hizballah used these areas for terrorist recruitment, training, fundraising, and financing. The Government of Lebanon did not take meaningful actions to disarm Hizballah, even though Hizballah continued its weapons buildup in defiance of UNSCR 1701. Other terrorist groups, including Hamas and t he Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, continued to operate inside Lebanon's Palestinian refugee camps, which remain outside of Lebanese government control. Lebanon's lack of a strong control regime for the storage and movement of weaponizable materials posed risks for the spread of WMDs, including for potential terrorism. In 2021 the Lebanese Arms Forces, Internal Security Forces, and other Lebanese authorities partnered with U.S. government agencies to detect and prevent proliferation and tra fficking of WMD. Libya. Libya remained politically divided during the year between the Government of National Unity (GNU) and eastern -based parallel institutions and groups. Terrorist groups attempted to exploit a security vacuum in the southern region of the country but were limited in their ability to do so because of tactical gains by the self -styled Libyan National Army (LNA) against these groups. The nationwide ceasefire signed in 2020, after the LNA's failed attempt to take control of Great er Tripoli, was largely respected. The GNU, although the internationally recognized government, lacked the capacity and reach to exercise control in most of Libya and relied on armed groups for security in areas it did not have the ability to effectively control, including the capital Tripoli. The GNU had limited ability to eliminate terrorist safe havens, track or prevent the flow of FTFs in and out of the country or ensure effective counterproliferation efforts owing to difficulties of controlling the b orders and underresourced enforcement of security procedures at airports, seaports, and land -border crossings. The GNU and aligned groups maintained their strongest influence in the Western Mountains and the northwest coastal areas stretching from the Tun isian border to territory just west of Sirte. LNA -aligned groups exerted control in the remainder of Libya, including Cyrenaica, and the central and southern districts of Jufra, Kufra, Murzuq, and Sabh. Although significantly degraded, remnants of terro rist groups such as ISIS and al -Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb continue to pose threats particularly in Libya's vast, sparsely populated desert areas in the South. The LNA effectively countered terrorism in the East and the South of the country, but its co unterterrorism gains were limited to areas under its control. During the year, significant numbers of foreign forces, fighters, and mercenaries remained deployed to the country, including the Russian -backed private military company Wagner Group. Yemen . The Iran -backed Houthis continued to control large portions of northern Yemen, where the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps continued to maintain a presence. The Saudi -led coalition, which includes Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), provided support to the Republic of Yemen government (ROYG) , which continued to fight to hold off further advances and reclaim areas held by the Houthis. The ROYG, with Saudi and Emirati support, continued counterterrorism operations to degrade al -Qa'ida in the Ar abian Peninsula (AQAP) and ISIS -Yemen operations in the country. However, owing to the ongoing conflict, instability, and its own degraded capabilities, the ROYG was constrained severely in its ability to prevent terrorist training, funding, recruitment, and transit. Although AQAP and ISIS -Yemen have been weakened in recent years, the two groups continued to benefit from the ongoing conflict, successfully instilling themselves among elements of the anti -Houthi coalition and exploiting the security vacuum with room to operate in large parts of the country. Further, AQAP continued to harbor external operations ambitions. The ROYG was as cooperative with U.S., Saudi, and Emirati counterterrorism operations as its limited capacity allowed. Yemen's political instability continued to hinder efforts to enact or enforce comprehensive strategic trade controls to counter the flow of weapons and munitions in the region. This left Yemen vulnerable as a transit point for destabilizing weapons, including weapons orig inating from Iran. The government was not known to support or facilitate the proliferation or trafficking of WMD in or through its territories. SouthAsia Afghanistan. Terrorist and insurgent groups, including ISIS -K, elements of AQ (including affiliate al -Qa'ida in the Indian Subcontinent [AQIS]), and terrorist groups targeting Pakistan (such as Tehrik -e-Taliban Pakistan) , continued to use Afghanistan, especially its remote regions, as a safe haven throughout 2021. Before the withdr awal of U.S. forces and the Taliban takeover of Kabul, U.S. and Afghan security forces partnered in numerous counterterrorism efforts through Operation Freedom's Sentinel , and the Afghan government executed its own counterterrorism operations. After the Taliban takeover of Kabul, the danger of terrorist groups operating from safe havens in Afghanistan increased significantly. The Taliban itself remains a U.S. Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT), and several members of the Taliban are individually UN and/or U.S. designated terrorists. Haqqani Network, which is designated as an FTO and SDGT, has members and key leaders who have also assumed both formal and informal roles within the Taliban. The Taliban has committed publicly to meet its Doha Agree ment commitment to prevent any group or individual from using Afghan soil to threaten the security of the United States and its allies. However, the extent of the Taliban's ability to prevent AQ and ISIS -K from mounting external operations remained unclea r. Though al -Qa'ida has weakened, its regional affiliate in the Indian subcontinent (AQIS) continued to operate from remote locations in Afghanistan that have served as safe havens. ISIS-K increased high -profile attacks against civilians in Afghanistan b oth before and after the Taliban takeover of Kabul, often targeting vulnerable minority populations such as Hazara Shias. In November the UN said there were 334 attacks attributed to ISIS -K so far in the year, compared with 60 in 2020, and assessed that I SIS-K was present in nearly all the country's provinces. In August an ISIS -K suicide attack at Hamid Karzai International Airport killed 183 people, including 13 members of the U.S. military. ISIS-K was estimated to have 2,000 to 3,000 fighters in Afghan istan in 2021. The potential for WMD trafficking and proliferation in Afghanistan remained a concern. Before August the United States helped the Afghanistan government enhance its capabilities to prevent, detect, and respond to nuclear and other radioact ive material smuggling incidents. Before the Taliban takeover of Kabul, the Afghanistan and U.S. governments also continued to work to implement comprehensive strategic trade controls and to strengthen Afghanistan's border security; however, since the Tal iban takeover of Kabul, U.S. -Afghan cooperation in border security has ceased, potentially increasing the possibility of WMD trafficking. Pakistan. Major terrorist groups focused on conducting attacks within Pakistan included Tehrik -e-Taliban Pakistan (T TP), the Balochistan Liberation Army, and ISIS -K. The TTP and other designated terrorist groups continue to conduct attacks against Pakistani military and civilian targets. Although Pakistan's national action plan calls to \"ensure that no armed militias are allowed to function in the country,\" several UN - and U.S. -designated terrorist groups that focus on attacks outside the country continued to operate from Pakistani soil in 2021, including the Haqqani Network, Lashkar -e-Tayyiba (LeT), and Jaish -e-Mohamm ed (JeM). Although Pakistan took some steps in 2021 to counter terror financing and to restrain some India -focused militant groups, authorities did not take sufficient action to dismantle them. In September, Pakistan successfully prosecuted JeM founder M asood Azhar in absentia and JeM leader Abdul Rauf Azhar; however, LeT and JeM continue to operate within Pakistan. Pakistan is committed to combating the trafficking of items that could contribute to the development of WMDs and their delivery systems. Pa kistan was a constructive and active participant in IAEA -hosted meetings and in the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. Western Hemisphere Colombia. Rough terrain and dense forest cover, combined with low population densities and historically weak government presence, define Colombia's borders with Brazil, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. Historically, these conditions have allowed terrorist groups \u2014 particularly Segunda Marquetalia, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -People's Army (FARC -EP), and the National Liberation Army (ELN) \u2014 to operate. The 2016 peace accord between the Government of Colombia and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) led to the demobilization of the majority of FARC combatants and the FARC's conversion into a political party. However, ongoing challenges to peace accord implementation and continued security vacuums have created risk for terrorist activity and attacks on civilians, security forces, and infrastructure in some areas in 202 1. A troubling number of FARC members refused to demobilize, estimated at around 2,600 individuals who chose not to participate in the peace process or who have subsequently joined the dissident ranks of the Segunda Marquetalia and FARC -EP. They continue d engaging in terrorist and other criminal activities, particularly in border regions and areas previously controlled by the FARC. The ELN perpetrated armed attacks across the country in 2021. The government was not known to support or facilitate the pro liferation or trafficking of WMD in or through its territory. Cuba. Cuba, citing peace negotiation protocols, refused Colombia's request to extradite 10 ELN leaders living in Havana after that group claimed responsibility for the 2019 bombing of the national police academy in Bogot\u00e1, killing 22 people and injuring 87 others. During 2019, Colombia filed extradition requests for ELN leaders Victor Orlando Cubides (aka Pablo Tejada) and Israel Ram\u00edrez Pineda (aka Pablo Beltr\u00e1n) with the Cuban government, to which Cuba has not acceded. Cuba also harbors several U.S. fugitives from justice wanted on charges of political violence, many of whom have resided in Cuba for decades. For example, the Cuban government has refused to return Joanne Chesimard, aka Assat a Shakur, a fugitive on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists List, who was convicted of executing New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster. Cuba also has refused to return William \"Guillermo\" Morales, a fugitive bomb maker for the Armed Forces for National Li beration (or FALN), who is wanted by the FBI and escaped detention after being convicted of charges related to domestic terrorism; Ishmael LaBeet, aka Ishmael Muslim Ali, who received eight life sentences after being convicted of killing eight persons in t he U.S. Virgin Islands in 1972 and hijacking a plane to flee to Cuba in 1984; and Charles Lee Hill, who has been charged with the 1971 killing of New Mexico State Policeman Robert Rosenbloom. The Cuban government provides housing, food ration books, and m edical care for fugitives residing there. In 2021 the Department of State designated Cuba a State Sponsor of Terrorism, citing, in part, the continued presence of ELN negotiators. The government was not known to support or facilitate the proliferation or trafficking of WMD in or through its territory. Venezuela. Much of Venezuela is ungoverned, undergoverned, or ill governed. The Maduro regime allows and tolerates the use of its territory by terrorist organizations. The regime continues to provide saf e haven for Foreign Terrorist Organizations, including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -People's Army (FARC -EP), Segunda Marquetalia, and the Colombian -origin National Liberation ties with regime -aligned Segunda Marquetalia , ELN, and Venezuelan paramilitary groups facilitate the public corruption and graft schemes of the regime to include members of the armed forces. However, Venezuelan security services also have clashed with FARC dissident groups. Colombian authorities c ontend that significant numbers of ELN, Segunda Marquetalia, and FARC -EP leaders and members are located in Venezuela. The government was not known to support or facilitate the proliferation or trafficking of WMD in or through its territory. White -Identity Terrorism/Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremism Pursuant to the FY 2021 NDAA, section 1299F(h), the Department of State was directed to incorporate in the annual Country Reports on Terrorism all credible information about \"whi te- identity terrorism\" (WIT), including relevant attacks, the identification of perpetrators and victims of such attacks, the size and identification of organizations and networks, and the identification of notable ideologues. In 2021 the Counterterroris m Bureau instructed all Department diplomatic and consular posts to engage with their host governments regarding individuals or groups affiliated with REMVE, with particular attention to advocates for WIT who perceive that their idealized ethnically white identity is under attack from or is being replaced by those who represent and support multiculturism and globalization. In response, European governments and the European Union reported that REMVE, including WIT, was a growing counterterrorism priority b ut noted that many governments have decades of experience addressing these types of threats. Several European governments and the EU observed that groups engaged in REMVE, including WIT, lack hierarchical structures and typically do not have a central com mand. They assessed that lone actors pose a greater threat than more formalized organizations, with these individuals communicating and influencing one another on social media, including closed chat groups and messaging platforms. Such groups also organi ze both virtually and in person in unofficial settings, such as employment groups, sports clubs, and concerts. In 2021, there were no known successful WIT attacks and one successful conviction for planned WIT violence: United Kingdom: In June, neo -Nazi Dean Morrice was sentenced to 18 years in jail for multiple terror offenses that included stockpiling explosive materials for making bombs. UK Police also found he had terrorism manuals and instructions for a 3D -printed gun. In additi on, foreign partners in 2021 designated, proscribed, banned, or subjected to similar actions and/or authorities the groups below. Statutory criteria and domestic legal authorization to take such action differ greatly across governments. For example, othe r governments may rely solely on speech -related activity as the basis of the designation, proscription, or banning actions, which raises freedom -of-expression concerns and is not permissible in the United States under First Amendment protections. Internat ional actions taken in 2021 included the following: Alvarium (banned by France) was created in 2018 in Angers, France. French authorities banned Alvarium for promoting violence and discrimination against individuals based on their country of origin or re ligion and accuse Alvarium of engaging in anti -immigrant and anti-Islam speech. French authorities note that Alvarium maintains links with other like - minded groups, and that Alvarium members were repeatedly involved in acts of violence and vandalism. Aryan Strikeforce (ASF) (designated by Canada) was founded in the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010. Canadian authorities note that the neo -Nazi group aims to carry out violent activities to overthrow governments, start a race war, and eradicate ethnic minorities. According to Canadian authorities, ASF subscribes to the philosophy of decentralized leaderless resistance and has had chapters in the UK and the United States, and contacts in Eastern Europe, South America, South Africa, and Canada. Canadian authorities note that members of the group have been convicted of crimes in the UK and the United States involving the production of chemical weapons, preparing and possessing material useful to commit acts of terrorism, facilitating the transfer of bomb making instructions, and attempting to secure illegal firearms. Canadian authorities note that ASF had planned a suicide bombing attack on counter protesters during a 2016 white -supremacist rally in Pennsylvania. Atomwaffen Division (designated by Canada a nd the United Kingdom) was founded in the United States in 2013. Canadian authorities note that the Atomwaffen Division (AWD) calls for acts of violence against racial, religious, and ethnic groups and informants, police, and bureaucrats, to prompt the co llapse of society. According to Canadian authorities, AWD has previously held training camps, also known as hate camps, where its members receive weapons and hand -to-hand combat training. AWD members have also carried out violent acts at public rallies, including the 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. According to UK authorities, AWD's online propaganda has encouraged and promoted terrorist acts and this content likely remains influential among accelerationist groups. UK authorities note that in 2 020 AWD claimed it had disbanded , following pressure from U.S. law enforcement agencies. In 2020, the National Socialist Order (NSO) announced itself online as AWD's \"successor. \" UK authorities note that AWD is almost certainly now operating under the name NSO in the United States. The Base (designated by Australia, Canada, and the UK) is a neo -Nazi organization founded in 2018. Canadian authorities note that the group was prim arily active in the United States and promotes a nihilistic and accelerationist rhetoric \u2014 an ideology embraced by white supremacists who have determined that a societal collapse is both imminent and necessary. The group advocates for direct action, espec ially in the form of violence, to create chaos, incite a race war, and establish a white ethno -state. The network specifically seeks to recruit individuals with military experience so that they can leverage their training. According to Canadian authoriti es, the Base has distributed manuals for lone -wolf terror attacks, bomb making, countersurveillance, and guerilla warfare to its members. Canadian authorities note that group members plotted to carry out attacks at a 2020 rally in the U.S. state of Virgin ia, and the group also organized training camps in weaponry and military tactics around North America. G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Identitaire (banned by France) is a Lyon -based group that \"incites discrimination, hatred, and violence\" against individuals based on their c ountry of origin or religion. French authorities accuse the group of engaging in anti -immigrant and anti - Islam speech. According to French authorities, the group, which has branches in several European countries, could be regarded \"as having the characte r of a private militia\" and has ties to white -supremacist groups. Also according to French authorities, G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Identitaire has tried to patrol land and sea borders to prevent migrants from reaching Europe. James Mason (designated by Canada) is a life long American neo -Nazi responsible for publishing a series of newsletters during the 1980s that promoted the idea of lone actors conducting terrorist attacks against the United States government to bring about the collapse of society and a race war. Accor ding to Canadian authorities, Mason's collective works, published as a book called Siege, have served as the ideological grounding for neo -Nazi groups such as Atomwaffen Division (AWD) and serves as the backbone for AWD's worldview and training program. C anadian authorities note that Mason also has provided tactical direction on how to operate a terrorist group and has met with members of AWD, where he coached them on propagandizing murder and genocide. Proud Boys (designated by Canada) is a neofascist organization that was formed in 2016 and engages in political violence. Canadian authorities note that members of the group espouse misogynistic, Islamophobic, antisemitic, anti -immigrant, and/or white - supremacist i deologies and associate with other white -supremacist groups. According to Canadian authorities, the group consists of semi -autonomous chapters located in the United States, Canada, and internationally. The group and its members have openly encouraged, pl anned, and conducted violent activities against those they perceive to be opposed to their ideology and political beliefs. According to Canadian authorities, the group regularly attends Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests as counter protesters, often engagi ng in violence targeting BLM supporters. Canadian authorities note that on January 6 the Proud Boys played a pivotal role in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol; leaders of the group planned their participation by setting out objectives, issuing instruct ions, and directing members during the insurrection. The leader of the Proud Boys was arrested two days before the insurrection as part of a stated effort by U.S. law enforcement to apprehend individuals who were planning to travel to the Washington, D.C. , area with intentions to cause violence. Russian Imperial Movement (designated by Canada), or RIM, provided paramilitary - style training to white supremacists and neo -Nazis in Europe and actively works to rally these types of groups into a common front ag ainst their perceived enemies. In 2016, two Swedish individuals attended RIM's training course; thereafter, they committed a series of bombings in Gothenburg, Sweden, targeting a refugee shelter, a shelter for asylum seekers, and a caf\u00e9 \u2014 crimes for which they were convicted in Sweden. In 2020, the U.S. government also designated RIM and members of its leadership as Specially Designated Global Terrorists. Sonnenkrieg Division (designated by Australia) is a UK-based white -supremacist group established in 2018 as a splinter group of the System Resistance Network. Members of the group were convicted in the UK of \"encouraging terrorism and possession of documents useful to a terrorist\" in 2019. The group encouraged and glorified acts of terro rism through its posts and images. Three Percenters (designated by Canada) are a decentralized entity within the broader anti-government militia movement in the United States, with a presence in the United States and Canada. Canadian authorities note tha t the Three Percenters have been linked to bomb plots targeting U.S. federal government buildings and Muslim communities. Canadian authorities further note that in 2015 a Three Percenter was arrested and convicted of shooting and wounding five men at a BL M demonstration in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 2020, two of the group's leaders directed a plot to kidnap the governor of Michigan, which involved acquiring and detonating explosives to divert police attention from the kidnapping, as well as to carry out p ublic executions of public officials by hanging them on live television. Countering Terrorism on the Economic Front In 2021 the Department of State designated five new groups as FTOs and amended one existing FTO designation by adding aliases. In addit ion, 30 entities and individuals were designated as SDGTs under the Department's authorities in Executive Order (E.O.) 13224. The Department also reviewed and maintained the FTO designations of 15 entities. The Department of the Treasury also designated entities and individuals under E.O.13224, as amended. For a list of all U.S. designations, see the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. 2021 Foreign Terrorist Organizati on/Executive Order 13224 Group Designations On January 14 the Department of State designated Harakat Sawa'd Misr (HASM) as an FTO. HASM was previously designated under E.O. 13224 on January 31, 2018. (See Chapter 5, Foreign Terrorist Organizations, for further information on HASM.) On March 10 the Department of State designated the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria -Democratic Republic of the Congo (ISIS -DRC) under E.O. 13224. The FTO designation of ISIS -DRC became effective on March 11. (See Chapter 5, Foreign Terrorist Organizations, for further information on ISIS -DRC.)

Garzon, also known as Romana, is a senior leader in Segunda Marquetalia with military operations responsibilities. Multilateral Efforts to Counter Terrorism In 2021 the United States cont inued to work through multilateral organizations to promote U.S. approaches to countering terrorism, and to strengthen regional and international counterterrorism efforts, including by developing and promoting global norms and building the capacities of st ates to implement them. At the UN, the United States supported negotiations to conduct the biennial review of the UN Global Counterterrorism Strategy and the renewal of the UN Counterterrorism Executive Directorate mandate that updated the international c ounterterrorism framework to address evolving threats, including racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism (REMVE). Other examples of U.S. multilateral engagement are described below. The United Nations. One priority for the United States is su stained and strategic engagement at the UN on counterterrorism issues. Throughout 2021 the UN remained actively engaged in addressing the evolving threat of terrorism to international peace and security, including through the biennial review of the UN Glo bal Counterterrorism Strategy, the renewal of the UN Counterterrorism Executive Directorate mandate that updated the international counterterrorism framework to address evolving threats (including REMVE), and the renewal of the UN 1267 ISIL and al -Qa'ida s anctions mandate. U.S. engagement with UN actors on counterterrorism included the following: The UN Security Council and its Counter -Terrorism Committee (CTC) and Counter - Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED). The United States led the successful negot iation of UNSCR 2617 (2021) that was adopted unanimously on December 27 to renew the UN/CTED mandate for another four years. The resolution focuses on the protection of human rights, inclusion of civil society, and importance of rule -of-law-based countert errorism approaches, and it addresses new and evolving threats for the first time in a UNSCR that condemns terrorism \"on the basis of xenophobia, racism, and other forms of intolerance.\" Further, it recognizes the need to improve the collection, handling, preservation, and sharing of battlefield evidence; recognizes the increasing global misuse of unmanned aerial systems by terrorists to conduct terrorist attacks; and calls for a global report within one year to assess member states' implementation of the provisions in UNSCRs 2178 (2014) and 2396 (2017) to counter terrorist travel and address the evolving threat of foreign terrorist fighters and their accompanying families. The United States also supported the negotiation of several resolutions and Preside ntial Statements, including one to commemorate the 20th anniversary of September 11. The United States supported CTC and CTED efforts to assess evolving terrorist trends and to analyze capacity gaps of member states to implement UNSCRs 1373, 1624, 2178, 2 396, and other relevant counterterrorism resolutions, and to facilitate training and other technical assistance to UN member states. In 2021, CTED held six open briefings on issues including terrorist threats to civil aviation and the role of the criminal justice sector in bringing terrorists to justice through the effective use of battlefield - or military -collected evidence. CTED also completed 67 Overview of Implementation Assessments and Detailed Implementation Surveys and shared 18 assessment visit re ports with the Global Counterterrorism Coordination Platform, which was launched in March. UN Security Council Sanctions Regimes. In 2021 the United States led or supported the listing of four individuals by the Security Council's 1267 ISIL/Da'esh and Al -Qaida Sanctions Committee and three individuals by the 751 Somalia Sanctions Committee; these were the first three additions to the 751 Somalia Sanctions Committee since 2018. In addition, ISIS -Tunisia (aka JAK -T) was listed by the 1267 Sanctions Committ ee, bringing the total number of ISIS affiliates listed at the UN since 2019 to seven. The United States worked closely with the UN 1267 ISIL/Da'esh and Al -Qaida Sanctions Committee by proposing listings, providing amendments, engaging the committee's omb udsperson regarding petitions for de -listings, and providing input to the committee to enhance its procedures and implementation of sanctions measures. The United States also assisted the monitoring team with information for its research and reports. Thr ee individuals were de - listed, and 163 entries were amended during the year, supporting the UN 1267 Committee's priority to ensure due process and accurate listings. The total figures on the list are 264 individuals and 89 entities, as of December 31. Th e committee also worked to ensure the integrity of the list by conducting regular reviews and endeavoring to remove those individuals and entities that no longer meet the criteria for listing. The United States also led the negotiation of several other co unterterrorism sanctions -related UN Security Council Resolutions, including UNSCR 2615, which provided a humanitarian exemption for the Taliban Sanctions Regime; UNSCR 2611, which renewed the mandate of the Taliban sanctions regime's Monitoring Team; and U NSCR 2610, which renewed the mandate of the ISIS/AQ sanctions regime's Monitoring Team. The UN Global Assembly and UN Office of Counterterrorism. The UN Office of Counterterrorism (UNOCT) continued to work closely with the 40 UN entities plus INTERPOL, the World Customs Organization, and the Inter -Parliamentary Union through the Global Counterterrorism Coordination Compact, to ensure balanced implem entation of the four pillars of the UN Global Counterterrorism Strategy: 1) strengthen the delivery of UN counterterrorism capacity building assistance to member states; 2) promote and improve visibility; 3) advocacy; and 4) resource mobilization for UN counterterrorism efforts. The United States supported the biennial review of the UN Global Counterterrorism Strategy in 2021 and negotiated a General Assembly resolution that updated the global counterterrorism framework to address threats and challenges a ssociated with REMVE, repatriation of foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) and their families, battlefield evidence, terrorist use of drones, terrorist sentencing commensurate with the seriousness of the crime, and soft targets protection and security. The U nited States also participated in the UN's Counterterrorism High -Level Week organized by UNOCT by providing high -level speakers in several of the side events, focusing on FTF repatriation; countering terrorist misuse of unmanned aerial systems; terrorist w atchlisting; REMVE; and terrorist use of new and emerging technologies. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime's (UNODC's) Terrorism Prevention Branch (TPB) continued to assist countries seeking to ratify and implement the universal legal instruments against terrorism, and it provided assistance for countering the financing of terrorism in conjunction with UNODC's Global Program Against Money Laundering, Proceeds of Crime and the Financing of Terrorism. The United States supported UNODC/TPB as a counterterrorism assistance implementer, particularly for programming concentrated on strengthening the criminal justice system's response to terrorism by member states. In 2021 the United States continued to support U NODC/TPB programs that concluded a series of training workshops in North Africa and South and Central Asia on countering terrorist travel and supporting border - related terrorism prosecutions. This workshop series, beginning in 2019 and funded in part by the Counterterrorism Bureau, highlighted best practices in watchlisting, information sharing, screening, and evidence collection to assist countries in meeting the obligations of UNSCR 2396. The United States also participated in the UNODC Expert Group on the Prevention of and Responses to Terrorist Attacks on the Basis of Xenophobia, Racism and other forms of Intolerance, or in the name of Religion or Belief and coordinated U.S. government input that will be included in the UNODC training manual. The UN S ecurity Council 1540 Committee. The 1540 Committee monitors and facilitates efforts to implement UNSCR 1540 (2004) requirements, which address the nexus of proliferation concerns surrounding chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons and their means of del ivery, on the one hand, and activities by nonstate actors, who wittingly or unwittingly provide WMD -related assistance to terrorist organizations, on the other. The 1540 Committee's Group of Experts (GoE) participates in a wide range of multilateral and regional activities designed to facilitate technical assistance to member states when they request it. Using Office for Disarmament Affairs Trust Fund resources to cover expenses, the GoE also has interacted with the Organization for the Prohibition of Che mical Weapons, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, the World Customs Organization, INTERPOL, UNODC, the Financial Action Task Force, and other multilateral counterterrorism bodies, as well as with individual countries to this end. The United States is one of eight countries, plus the EU, that have contributed to the 1540 Trust Fund, which is used to support these activities and to financially support 1540 regional coordinator positions in the OAS, the OSCE, the AU, and ASEAN. U.S. funds also continued to be used to conduct projects that assist African, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries in strengthening national 1540 implementation by providing training to national 1540 points of contact and developing volu ntary national action plans (NAPs). Given the key role played by current 1540 coordinators in GoE -supported peer -to-peer reviews, the United States will continue to promote the idea of establishing additional 1540 regional coordinators, to increase the nu mber and quality of NAPs in the lead -up to a UNSCR 1540 Comprehensive Review, which will take place throughout 2022. The Global Counterterrorism Forum. Founded in 2011 by the United States and T\u00fcrkiye , the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF) aims to dim inish terrorist recruitment and radicalization while increasing countries' capacity to deal with terrorist threats within their borders and regions by strengthening civilian institutions to counter terrorism. Canada and Morocco are GCTF co -chairs until la te 2022. The GCTF comprises three thematic and two regional working groups: Countering Violent Extremism, Criminal Justice and the Rule of Law, Foreign Terrorist Fighters, Capacity Building in the East Africa Region, and Capacity Building in the West Afr ica Region. In 2017 the United States and Jordan became co -chairs of the Foreign Terrorist Fighters Working Group for an initial two -year term. The United States and Jordan renewed their co -chairmanship of the FTF Working Group in 2019 for another two -year term, now extended until late 2022 because of the COVID -19 global pandemic. The United Nations is a close partner of the GCTF and a participant in its activities. The GCTF continued to increase cooperation and partnership as outlined in the 2018 joint GCTF -UN statement marking enhanced cooperation between the two bodies. The GCTF serves as a mechanism to further the implementation of the UN Global Counterterrorism Strategy and more broadly to complement and reinforce existing multilateral counterterro rism efforts, starting with those of the UN. The GCTF also partners with a wide range of regional multilateral organizations, including the Council of Europe, the OSCE, NATO, the AU, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, and ASEAN. In October, GCTF ministers formally endorsed two new framework documents and an addendum to an existing framework document (found at www.thegctf.org): GCTF Good Practices for the Implementation of Countering the Financing of Terrorism Measures While Safeguarding Civi c Space Memorandum on Criminal Justice Approaches to the Linkages Between Terrorism and Core International Crimes, Sexual and Gender -Based Violence Crimes, Crimes, Human Trafficking, Migrant Smuggling, Slavery, and Crimes Against Children Addendum to the New York Memorandum on Good Practices for Interdicting Terrorist Travel Moreover in 2021, the GCTF continued the work of the Forum by migrating initiatives to webinar formats, including two co -led by the United States: The Watchlisting Guidance Manual initiative created a \"toolkit\" to assist countries with implementing a whole -of-government approach to managing the watchlisting and screening of known and suspected terrorists (KSTs). This toolkit is a useful resource for policy-makers, law enforcement officials, immigration and consular officers, and agencies that manage and operate watchlists. As states adopt the practices put forth in the toolkit, it should not only increase border security but also, through the standardiz ed management of watchlist information, increase trust in global information -sharing initiatives to stop terrorists. These practices also will help countries further implement recommendations in the New York Memorandum on Good Practices for Interdicting Terrorist Travel and obligations established in UNSCR 2396. The United States and the UN co -chaired four global webinars in 2020 and 2021. In 2022 the Maritime Security Initiative will couple with the Watchlisting Toolkit Initiative to host the first comb ined event to address best practices in security and border control with an emphasis on maritime efforts. 'The Initiative on Maritime Security and Terrorist Travel' addresses potential vulnerabilities in the maritime sector that could be exploited by ter rorists. In 2021, this initiative examined how to improve information sharing between and among governments on topics such as KSTs transitioning through official ports, the use of ships and small vessels as weapons, and the smuggling or trafficking of nar cotics or arms through subregional workshops focused on West Africa, East Africa, and East Asia Pacific's tri -maritime border (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines) culminating in the adoption of the Maritime Addendum to the New York Memorandum in October. 'Initiative on Criminal Justice Responses to the Linkages Between Terrorism, Transnational Organized Crimes, and International Crimes.' In 2021 the GCTF Criminal Justice and Rule of Law Working Group held virtual workshops to examine the links between t errorism and international crimes, which resulted in the adoption of the GCTF Memorandum on Criminal Justice Approaches to the Linkages Between Terrorism and Core International Crimes, Sexual and Gender -Based Violence Crimes, Crimes, Human Trafficking, Mig rant Smuggling, Slavery, and Crimes Against Children in October. 'Initiative on National -Local Cooperation in Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism Policy Toolkit Initiative.' Australia and Indonesia, as co -chairs of the CVE Working Group, held wor kshops in 2021, with further planned workshops in 2022, to provide context - and sector -specific tools, advice, and expertise to facilitate the translation of good practices into national and local action. The co -chairs plan to resend a draft Gender and Pr eventing CVE (P/CVE) Policy Toolkit at the Twentieth 2022. The GCTF's 'Strategic Vision Initiative,' launched by GCTF co -chairs Canada and Morocco, reaffirmed GCTF founding principles as reflected in the 2011 Political Decla ration and emphasized the importance of the GCTF's contributions to the civilian counterterrorism landscape. This initiative resulted in the adoption of the \"GCTF Strategic Vision for the Next Decade\" in 2021. This Strategic Vision seeks to provide new m omentum to the Forum's work, builds on its achievements, and strengthens its overall impact and relevance, including considering proposals on ways to deepen and broaden the implementation of GCTF Framework Documents. Racially or Ethnically Motivated Viol ent Extremism (REMVE) Initiative: The United States launched the GCTF's work in addressing REMVE -related challenges in 2021. In April t he United States led two GCTF Exploratory Dialogues \u2014 among the first multilateral events focused exclusively on international REMVE threats and challenges. The dialogues featured keynote remarks from Acting CT Coordinator John Godfrey and were attended v irtually by nearly 150 participants, representing more than 50 countries and 70 organizations and academic institutions. During two online webinars, discussions focused on varying definitions, the current REMVE landscape, current legal frameworks, and pra ctical operational and policy responses to the REMVE threat. Speakers examined existing GCTF resources pertaining to the REMVE threat, current gaps in available resources, and how the GCTF could best address REMVE -related challenges. As a result of these dialogues, the United States partnered with Norway (a non -GCTF Member) in October to initiate the development of a GCTF REMVE Toolkit that will outline good practices in addressing the REMVE radicalization lifecycle, drawing on and complementing the Inter national Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law's Criminal Justice Practitioner's Guide Addressing Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremism. The GCTF REMVE Toolkit will be developed through a series of virtual seminars and workshops and prese nted to the GCTF's 21st Coordinating Committee in September 2022 for review and adoption. GCTF -Inspired Institutions. The following three institutions were developed to operationalize GCTF good practices and to serve as mechanisms for strengthening civil ian criminal justice responses to terrorism: The International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law. Since its establishment in Malta in 2014, the International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law (IIJ) has become a widely respected training institution for sustainable rule -of-law capacity building activities to criminal justice sector practitione rs, including lawmakers, police, prosecutors, judges, corrections officials, policymakers, and other justice sector stakeholders on how to address terrorism and related transnational criminal activities. In the last five years, the IIJ has trained more th an 7,000 criminal justice practitioners from 123 participating countries. In 2021 the IIJ continued its steady increase in investment from donors, including from Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the EU. Through funding from the United States, the IIJ trained more than 700 practitioners in 2021 on issues related to battlefield evidence, REMVE, addressing homegrown terrorism, combating prison radicalization, successfully prosecuting te rrorism, increasing international cooperation in terrorism investigations and prosecutions, juvenile justice, and the successful launch of the first -ever counterterrorism academic curriculum (CTAC) for midlevel practitioners. Despite the COVID -19 global p andemic, the IIJ's new Academic Unit adapted the CTAC course, designed to provide a baseline counterterrorism knowledge for midlevel law enforcement and criminal justice actors for a virtual environment. Additionally, the IIJ and the UN Office on Drugs an d Crime continued a Department of State -supported initiative to identify practical approaches to managing remote access for judicial proceedings in terrorism cases in response to the challenges posed by the COVID -19 pandemic. Finally, the IIJ, in partners hip with the United States and the UK, published its Criminal Justice Practitioner's Guide Addressing Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremism in July and launched a follow -on initiative to socialize these practices with partner governments at a UN General Assembly side event in September. Hedayah . Hedayah is the first -ever international center of excellence for CVE, headquartered in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Hedayah concentrates on capacity building, dialogue and CVE communication s, and research and analysis. Hedayah continued to organize capacity building workshops on CVE communications, education -based approaches to CVE, countering REMVE efforts, rehabilitation and reintegration workshops, and CVE national action plans. In 2021 , Hedayah supported Tunisia and Tajikistan to improve these governments' awareness of P/CVE strategic communication approaches and tools through a new CVE communication strategy. Hedayah also helped find innovative solutions to counter terrorist use of th e internet by helping counter terrorist and violent extremist narratives working with tech companies, youths, and students to develop their own solutions to online violent extremist propaganda. Hedayah also continued to promote its \"Blueprint for a Rehabi litation and Reintegration Center,\" a best -practices tool developed to help rehabilitate and reintegrate FTFs and their family members. In 2021, Hedayah raised almost $13 million for programs and operating expenses from donors including Australia, Japan, Spain, the UAE, the UK, the United States, and the EU. Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund. In 2013 the GCTF called for the establishment of the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund (GCERF) to serve as the first global fund to stre ngthen community resilience to terrorism. Based in Geneva, Switzerland, GCERF focuses on preventing and countering terrorism by building the capacity of small, local, community -based organizations. Since its inception, GCERF has raised more than $150 mil lion from the United States, Switzerland, the European Union, Japan, Qatar, Canada, Norway, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, New Zealand, Sweden, Liechtenstein, Morocco, and Niger (a recipient and donor country). The United States has contributed $2 0.8 million thus far. GCERF has launched a public -private partnership program to encourage private companies to invest in its prevention programming. To date, several private -sector organizations have provided in -kind contributions. GCERF supports 35 gr ants in 14 partner countries: Albania, Bangladesh, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burkina Faso, Kenya, Kosovo, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, North Macedonia, the Philippines, Somalia, Sri Lanka, and Tunisia. Estimated conservatively, GCERF projects have reached 2.2 mill ion direct beneficiaries and 13.2 million indirect beneficiaries. In 2021, Niger became the first partner and donor country for GCERF. Strong Cities Network. In 2015 the Strong Cities Network (SCN) launched at the UN General Assembly with support from t he United States. With 25 founding members, the SCN now includes more than 150 local governments across six continents. The SCN provides local governments with a forum to exchange best practices and lessons learned on CVE, including through global summit s, regional workshops, exchanges, and an online portal. The London - based Institute for Strategic Dialogue serves as the SCN secretariat and conducts in -depth capacity building training and mentorship to members in Central Asia, East and West Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and the Western Balkans. With support from the United States, SCN members in Bangladesh, Kenya, and North Macedonia have developed local action plans. In January the SCN and the U.S. Conference of Ma yors organized a virtual discussion between the Dalai Lama and more than 70 local leaders from around the world on using kindness and compassion to counter hate and division. In October, the SCN partnered with other organizations to host REMVE -focused wor kshops in Bratislava for Slovak stakeholders and Brussels for stakeholders from Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United States. The International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL). Through its I -24/7 secure global police communications system, INTERPOL connects member states' law enforcement officials to its investigative and analytical databases, and to its system for requesting assistance in criminal investigative matters by sending messages and the publication of notice s for various purposes. The U.S. Department of State funds INTERPOL counterterrorism -related programs through INTERPOL's General Secretariat and INTERPOL Washington, the U.S. National Central Bureau (USNCB) of the U.S. Department of Justice, to help count ries affected by the FTF phenomenon provide access to I -24/7 to frontline officials. By extending these connections beyond a country's national central bureau to strategic, high -volume airports, seaports, and land ports of entry \u2014 as well as other governm ent agencies with investigative responsibilities \u2014 national authorities are better enabled to identify, deter, and interdict FTFs and other transnational criminals. Acknowledging the value of this initiative and the importance of addressing connectivity g aps in countries at risk of FTF travel, in 2016 the G -7 pledged to extend I-24/7 connectivity to 41 priority countries by the end of 2021. Since that pledge, the U.S. Department of State has engaged INTERPOL through the USNCB to help fulfill the G -7 commi tment by providing funding for projects aimed at extending connectivity in 19 countries. Additionally, the U.S. Department of State has provided resources directly to INTERPOL to enhance its capacity to receive, analyze, and disseminate information regard ing the identities and movements of FTFs. Developing the organization's capacity to process and disseminate this critical information supports the provision to member country law enforcement and border control authorities of actionable information to supp ort screening procedures and investigations into terrorism -related crimes. To further support this initiative, the U.S. Department of State also has provided funding to support the development of a platform that will enhance INTERPOL's analytic capability by allowing its disparate datasets to be easily filtered, queried, and cross - referenced to efficiently process associations, such as between an FTF identity profile and a reported lost or stolen travel document. The United States recognizes the great val ue in its long partnership with INTERPOL and the role of the USNCB to ensure critical FTF data are shared and accessible throughout the global law enforcement community. European Union. The EU and its member states remain top counterterrorism partners fo r the United States. The EU and the United States share a common definition of terrorism and have established a common list of terrorist groups. Most recently, the United States began working closely with the EU and its members states on countering racia lly or ethnically motivated violent extremism (REMVE), which the Europeans often refer to as \"right wing extremism\" or \"far -right extremism.\" These threats, largely from violent white supremacists, are on the rise in both Europe and the United States, whe re these actors' movements appear to be centered and based. There are significant transnational linkages between REMVE actors and networks on both sides of the Atlantic, and both the United States and the EU work together to tackle these threats. By work ing together, the United States and the EU made progress in elevating REMVE issues, both at the political and policy levels. While the military campaign to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria is now largely complete, the detention of terrorists, seizure of thei r associated materials, and management of evidence collected are critical to successfully prosecute and secure convictions of returning foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs). The EU is an integral partner in tackling these challenges associated with battlefie ld evidence, particularly in promoting its use to support investigations and prosecutions of FTFs. During COVID the U.S. government continued to encourage EU member states to take responsibility for their FTFs and associated family members located in al -Hol and al-Roj displaced persons camps by repatriating, prosecuting, rehabilitating, and reintegrating them as appropriate. Although EU institutions note that decisions related to repatriating FTFs and their family members from the battlefield in Syria are reserved for the member states, the EU has stated that rehabilitating and reintegrating returning citizens is a priority both at the EU and the national level. However, few repatriations took place during 2021, and human rights and humanitarian groups co ntinue to criticize the inaction of EU member states to repatriate their citizens. The U.S. Departments of Defense, Justice, and State continue efforts with the EU and its members states to facilitate the sharing of battlefield evidence, as well as emphas ize that counterterrorism cooperation is an important area for NATO -EU cooperation. In May the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) announced its first joint operation outside of the EU, deploying 50 officers to Albania in support of border se curity and managing migratory flows from Greece. In July and October, Frontex announced two additional operations in Montenegro to bolster the country's sea borders, with a particular concentration on anti-smuggling of drugs, weapons, trafficked humans, a nd terror material. The European Commission also signed two nonbinding counterterrorism arrangements with Albania and North Macedonia in October, and in December proposed revising Europol's mandate to improve the agency's ability to collect and analyze da ta relevant to cross -border crimes and terrorist offenses. The revised mandate would also allow Europol to create its own special category of \"information alerts\" in the Schengen Information System, using information sourced from third countries or intern ational organizations and subject to certain restrictions. Europol has officers and personnel in Italy and Greece who work alongside border security and immigration officers to assist in screening incoming migrants against Europol databases. Following a doption of its \"Counterterrorism Agenda\" in 2020, the European Commission proposed a variety of legislative tools in 2021 intended to improve the EU's collective defense against terrorism. In January, it issued a draft revision of the Europol Regulation t hat would allow, for the first time, Europol to establish lookouts in the EU's Schengen Information System for use by EU border and police authorities. The regulation is expected to be adopted by the Council and Parliament in 2022. In June the Regulation on Addressing the dissemination of terrorist content online entered into force, requiring service providers operating in the EU to remove content within one hour of notification by a competent authority in the EU. Also in June, the Commission published i ts Strategy towards a fully functioning and resilient Schengen Area, outlining plans to improve border management within the EU. In December it proposed an update to the Pr\u00fcm Decision that would further codify cross -border law enforcement cooperation in EU law and establish a consistent, EU -operated technical infrastructure for the exchange of data under Pr\u00fcm. This step, if approved, will bring Pr\u00fcm, first adopted in 2006, more in line with the EU's recent interoperability efforts. Despite these improvem ents, the EU's constantly evolving data privacy framework also continues to make law enforcement and border security cooperation between EU member states and non -EU countries, including the United States, more challenging. Internationally, the EU Council a dopted a decision in October launching a European Union Training Mission (EUTM) in Mozambique to counter terrorism in the northern province of Cabo Delgado. The EUTM became fully operational in December, with 84 military personnel (from EU member states) providing training in two centers. The two -year program is funded by the European Peace Facility to train 11 companies of Mozambican marines and commandos to serve as a quick reaction force to terrorist threats. The EU also continued six military and law enforcement capacity building missions in the Horn of Africa, the Central African Republic, and the Sahel, working closely with U.S. elements in counterterrorism, border security, and stabilization efforts. To date, the EU has pledged almost $270 million for the G -5 Sahel Joint Force, a coalition of five West African nations providing border security and counterterrorism operations in the Sahel. The EU has also initiated the Partnership for Stability and Security in the Sahel to assess the security secto r in West African countries and coordinate donor funding to fulfill their needs. Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Under Sweden as the 2021 Chair in Office, the OSCE approach to counterterrorism focused on working to address the use of the internet for terrorist purposes, mainstreaming a gender -responsive approach to counterterrorism, and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms. Under the Swedish chairmanship, the OSCE in April held its annual OSCE -wide Counterterrorism Confere nce as a virtual/in -person hybrid event. With an emphasis on using a whole -of-society approach to preventing and countering violent extremism and terrorism, common themes highlighted by the participating states included addressing terrorism, violent extre mism, and other potentially \"harmful\" online content, including through strengthening public -private partnerships and enhancing law enforcement cooperation, while respecting human rights such as freedom of expression. The United States in October also par ticipated in the fifth OSCE -wide Seminar on Passenger Data Exchange, urging OSCE participating states to establish Passenger Name Record systems based on International Civil Aviation Organization standards and practices. OSCE staff actively participated i n global and regional efforts supported by the United States through the GCTF, the IIJ, and NATO. North Atlantic Treaty Organization. At the June Summit, NATO allies reaffirmed NATO's role in the fight against terrorism, as it contributes to all three core tasks of the Alliance. Following the rapid collapse of the Afghan government and security forces in August and the end of NATO's Resolute Support Mission, NATO launched a comprehensive assessment of NATO's engagement in Afghanistan. This asses sment concluded, in part, that NATO made significant gains in the fight against terrorism, but that the wider ambition of building a stable Afghanistan proved extremely challenging. NATO formally updated the Counterterrorism Action Plan (CTAP) with contin ued emphases on awareness and analysis, preparedness and responsiveness, capabilities, capacity building and partnerships, and operations. The United States continued to invest foreign assistance resources to support implementation of the CTAP. With this support, NATO strengthened criminal justice actors' ability to investigate, prosecute, and adjudicate terrorism cases and enhance civilian -military coordination in the Middle East and North Africa through a Battlefield Evidence training at the Stability P olicing Center of Excellence in Vicenza, Italy, from November 29 through December 3. In June, Allies endorsed a Strengthened Resilience Commitment to continue to take a whole -of-government approach to enhancing the resilience of Allies' societies and achi eving the seven NATO Baseline Requirements for national resilience, through enhanced civil -military cooperation and civil preparedness; closer engagements with Allies' populations, the private sector, and non - governmental actors; and the centers of experti se on resilience established by Allies. NATO is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and provides Airborne Warning and Control System surveillance flights and staff -to-staff support. NATO international staff members regularly collaborate with the AU, the EU, the IIJ, the OSCE, the UN, and other international and regional organizations. Council of Europe. The United States participates in the Council of Europe (the CoE) as an observer. The CoE's counterterrorism priorities, a s established in its current 2018 -22 Strategy, include preventing terrorism through criminal law and law enforcement measures, ensuring terrorist offenses are investigated in the most efficient and quickest manner possible, and protecting persons against t errorism. The CoE's counterterrorism committee (CDCT) convened several working groups throughout the year on the Risk Assessment of Individuals Indicted or Convicted for Terrorist Offenses; Emerging Terrorist Threats; Best Practices Relating to Deradicali zation, Disengagement and Social Reintegration; and the Use of Information Collected in Conflict Zones as Evidence in Criminal Proceedings Related to Terrorist Offenses. The Council of Europe hosted a December 7 -8 conference on the Roles of Women and Chil dren in Terrorism, w here the United States highlighted funding for the Mother Schools: Parenting for Peace program. The biennial CDCT plenary addressed topics including battlefield evidence, addressing radicalization, increasing information sharing, and b ioterrorism. During the plenary, the United States worked with member states to advance critical support on battlefield evidence, terrorist radicalization, information sharing, and emerging terrorist threats, including REMVE. CoE staff members regularly coordinate with countries and other multilateral organizations and entities such as the EU, the OAS, the OSCE, and the UN. Group of Seven Roma -Lyon Group on Counterterrorism and Counter -Crime: The UK served as the 2021 Group of Seven (G -7) President and set an ambitious agenda for the year that culminated in the adoption of the G -7 Interior and Security Ministerial Statement that focused on counterterrorism -related priorities and deliverables, including data sharing on threats from Afghanistan; countering REMVE; preventing and countering terrorism and violent extremism online; and collaboration on Passenger Name Record data and International Civil Aviation Organization standards. The United States participated in the experts working group on some key issu es, including terrorist use of the internet. The United States participated in the Roma - Lyon Group's Heads of Delegation meetings and the Roma -Lyon Group on Counterterrorism and Crime's six subgroups, ensuring the facilitation and implementation of ongoin g projects that develop good practices for counterterrorism and law enforcement. The United States also continued chairing the Roma Lyon Group's cross -modal Transportation Security Subgroup, including overseeing ongoing collaboration related to foreign in vestment in the transportation sector and on flight school security. Organization of American States' Inter -American Committee Against Terrorism. The OAS Inter -American Committee Against Terrorism (OAS/CICTE), which has 34 member states and 70 observers, focused activities in 2021 on cybersecurity, border security, preventing the financing of terrorism, preventing the proliferation of WMD, preventing violent extremism, the security of mass gatherings (including tourist destinations), and addressing the FT F phenomenon. OAS/CICTE led the commemoration of June 3 as Inter -American Day Against Terrorism, encouraging member states to counter terrorism in the Western Hemisphere and around the world. The committee held its 21st regular session in a virtual forma t during October 7-8. In 2021, 17 member states including the United States participated in the Inter -American Network on Counterterrorism. The network operates on a 24/7 basis to facilitate communication among points of contact designated by each member state, so they can respond more effectively to terrorist threats. OAS/CICTE staff regularly collaborate with other multilateral organizations, including the Council of Europe, the GCTF, and the UN. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the ASEAN R egional Forum, and the East Asia Summit. Counterterrorism activities with the 10 -member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the 27 -member ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) countries in 2021 included annual meetings on counterterrorism and transnat ional crime and capacity building through ASEAN -related institutions. The United States is leading a three -part ARF workshop series on information sharing and aviation security, designed to raise awareness of countries' obligations under UNSCR 2396 and to explain helpful tools for implementation. The first workshop was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2019. The second occurred virtually, in February. The third and final workshop in this series is anticipated for 2022. Building on these ARF workshops, the United States co -hosted, along with the governments of Indonesia and South Korea, workshops on watchlisting as well as on aviation security in the time of COVID with the 10 ASEAN countries. These workshops were postponed from 2020 but occurred in November. The United States also funded and participated in ASEAN workshops during the development of an ASEAN Training of Trainers Program to Address Disinformation and Promote Media Literacy in 2021, which will be incorporated into the Second Annual ASEAN - U.S. CVE workshop to be held in 2022. The East Asia Summit \u2014 which includes the 10 ASEAN members plus Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Russia, and the United States \u2014 issued several statements in 2021, including one on W omen, Peace, and Security, noting the importance of women's roles to addressing root causes of terrorism. In 2020 the United States and ASEAN negotiated a new five -year \"Plan of Action,\" which outlined continued and increased engagement on counterterroris m and countering violent extremism efforts. ASEAN in 2019 adopted the Bali Work Plan to Prevent and Counter the Rise of Radicalization and Violent Extremism 2019 -25. The objective of this workplan is to provide an implementation framework to guide releva nt ASEAN sectoral bodies, organs, and entities in carrying out the necessary activities and monitor effectiveness in preventing and countering terrorist radicalization and recruitment. The United States supported the process of developing the workplan thr ough participation in CVE workshops and providing technical assistance and consultations with various stakeholders, such as ASEAN sectoral bodies and civil society organizations, to provide input on the implementation of the workplan. CVE consultations fo r 2020 were largely focused on countering violent extremism through media literacy and advancing critical thinking. Owing to COVID -19 conditions in the region, the Second Annual ASEAN -U.S. CVE workshop, co - chaired with Indonesia, was postponed to 2022. The United States also works on counterterrorism issues, including in the maritime space, through the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting -Plus. Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation. Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC) continued to work under the Counterterr orism and Secure Trade Strategy adopted in 2019 and updated its annual workplan in 2021. The strategy, first adopted in 2011, endorses the principles of security, efficiency, and resilience and advocates for risk-based approaches to security challenges ac ross supply chains, travel, finance, and infrastructure. Members also concentrated on furthering the APEC Counterterrorism Working Group (CTWG) Strategic Plan 2018 -22, which set priorities in areas such as the evolving threat of FTFs, terrorist financing, border and critical infrastructure security, and information sharing. In 2021 the United States hosted a workshop on soft target protection in an aviation ecosystem. The CTWG Terms of Reference expired in 2021, and member economies did not reach consens us to endorse a new Terms of Reference. Senior officials did not renew the mandate of the group by year's end. Despite the sunsetting of the CTWG, APEC's counterterrorism efforts will continue through relevant existing subfora. The African Union. Ther e are two main bodies within the AU that lead its counterterrorism efforts \u2014 the Political Affairs, Peace and Security Department's Conflict Management Division, located at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; and the African Center for the Study and Research of Terrorism (CAERT) in Algiers. CAERT is the lead for all the AU's CVE activity. CAERT priorities include: 1) building capacity of member states on CT/CVE; 2) developing and/or implementing member -state CVE national action plans; and 3) enh ancing international cooperation to ensure relevant regional approaches are taken fully into account. In 2020 the AU's Peace and Security Council (PSC) established the Special Unit on Counterterrorism within the framework of the African Standby Force, whi ch has yet to be operationalized. Once in operation, the Special Unit will aim to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the PSC and the Regional Economic Communities. It also will share experiences and best practices, as well as lessons arising from continental and regional mechanisms deployed against terrorism and violent extremism, such as the African Union Mission in Somalia (or AMISOM), the Multinational Joint Task Force in the Lake Chad Basin, the G -5 Sahel, and the Nouakchott and Djibouti Processes. The effects of the COVID -19 pandemic slowed AU implementation of deepened counterterrorism focus. G-5 Sahel. Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger formed the G -5 Sahel in 2014 to concentrate on the four pillars of security, resilie nce, infrastructure, and governance. In 2021 the G-5 Sahel Joint Force conducted military operations to disrupt the activities of terrorist operations in transborder regions of the five member states. Multiple countries, including the United States and France, and the EU have provided or pledged donor support to the G -5 Sahel Joint Force. The League of Arab States: The League of Arab States ( LAS) is a regional organization consisting of 22 member states that promotes the interests of the Arab world. The LAS serves as a forum for member states to coordinate policy on matters of concern, including countering violent extremism and other threats. The LAS also is a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. The International Civil Aviation Organization. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that promotes the development of international air navigation safety and security standards and fosters the planning and development of international air transport to ensure safe and orderly growth. The ICAO adopts standards and recommended practices concerning air navigation, its infrastructure, flight inspection, prevention of unlawful interference, and facilitation of border -crossin g procedures for international civil aviation. The ICAO's AVSEC2021 event, which concluded on the eve of the anniversary of the September 11 attacks of 20 years ago, featured substantive and compelling discussions on aviation security, including contribut ions from current and former colleagues in government and industry. The ICAO's involvement during the crisis in Afghanistan progressed from issuing guidance to avoid Afghanistan's airspace to tackling the technical issues that culminate in the safety and security of civil aviation. The 2020 Council of ICAO approval of amendments to Annex 9 of the Chicago Convention establishing new Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) regarding states' development and use of Passenger Name Record (PNR) systems took effect in February. These SARPs are a direct response to UNSCR 2396 of 2017, which requires states to develop the capability to collect, process, and analyze PNR data, in furtherance of ICAO SARPs. UNSCR 2396 also requires states to ensure PNR data are used by and shared with all their competent national authorities, with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for the purpose of preventing, detecting, and investigating terrorist offenses and related travel. The United States continues to seek to raise the profile of aviation security within the ICAO Secretariat, with the objective of parity between safety and security in the ICAO. The Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. In 2021 the United States continued to serve as co -chair of the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT), a voluntary partnership of 89 nations and six international organizations committed to strengthening global capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to nuclear terrorism. In 2021 the GICNT held three virtual multilateral engagements that provided an interactive forum to share and discuss best practices around plans, policies, and procedures to detect and respond to radiological/nuclear terrorism incidents. Financial Action Task Force. The Fin ancial Action Task Force (FATF) is an intergovernmental body that sets standards and promotes effective implementation of legal, regulatory, and operational measures to combat money laundering, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing. FATF's effo rts to improve understanding and compliance with global FATF standards are supported by FATF -style regional bodies worldwide. In 2021, FATF continued to address terrorist financing through ongoing work. This included regular, nonpublic updates to the FAT F global network on the financing of ISIS and al -Qa'ida and their affiliates, and the completion of a nonpublic best practices paper on investigating and prosecuting terrorist financing and an update to previously issued terrorist financing risk indicators . FATF also published a report on ethnically or racially motivated terrorism financing in July. Christchurch Call to Action to Eliminate Terrorist and Violent Extremist Content Online (Christchurch Call). In May the United States officially joined the N ew Zealand - and France - led Christchurch Call, established in a 2019 Summit after the horrific livestreamed terrorist attacks in Christchurch earlier that year, and Secretary Blinken participated in the second annual Christchurch Call Summit. When the deci sion was announced, the United States applauded language in the Christchurch Call emphasizing the importance of respecting human rights and the rule of law, including the protection of freedom of expression, and noted that in participating in the Christchu rch Call, the United States would not take steps that would violate the freedoms of speech and association protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, nor violate people's reasonable expectations of privacy. The United States engaged in act ive partnership with governments, tech companies, and civil society in the forum's workstreams on key issues such as algorithms and positive interventions to better ensure that online platforms are not exploited for terrorist or violent extremist purposes. Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism. The United States continued to participate in the industry -led Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT). The GIFCT was established by Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Microsoft in 2017, in close par tnership with UN-affiliated Tech Against Terrorism, and reorganized as an NGO in 2020 to prevent and counter terrorist and violent extremist exploitation of online platforms through developing and sharing technology, including providing assistance to small er companies, research, and prevention programs. In 2021 the United States continued to serve on the GIFCT Independent Advisory Committee and participated in GIFCT Working Groups on Crisis Response, Legal Frameworks, Technical Approaches (including algori thmic amplification), and Positive Interventions. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . In 2021 the United States continued its efforts with government, tech company, civil society, and other expert stakeholders to develop the OECD's Ter rorist and Violent Extremist Content (TVEC) Voluntary Transparency Reporting Framework (VTRF). The aim of the VTRF as a tool is to increase voluntary reporting by all platforms of all sizes to help build the evidence base for sound policy - making as well a s to avoid regulatory fragmentation. The first phase of the OECD TVEC VTRF project was effectively completed under the auspices of the OECD Committee on Digital Economy Policy in 2021. A basic reporting template is expected to be released publicly in 202 2, to allow implementation and feedback from tech companies to inform further work. Aqaba Process. In 2021 the United States participated with other governments, private -sector companies, and selected stakeholders in Jordan's counterterrorism -focused Aqaba Process. King Abdullah II of Jordan launched the Aqaba Process in 2015 as an informal international platform that aimed to bring together government decisionmakers and other stakeholders to coordinate, at a strategic level, confronting terrorists and violent extremists both offline and online. Jordan started the Aqaba Process to address the need for a holistic approach that addresses all terrorist threats collectively and simultaneously, sometimes regionally or thematically. Jordan co -chaired with the United States the first Aqaba Process Tech Meeting in Napa, California, in 2019. Long -TermProgramsa ndInitiativesDesignedto Counter Terrorist Safe Havens and Recruitment Countering Violent Extremism Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) refers to proactive assistance and engagements designed to reduce the ability of violent extremist groups and their affiliates and adherents to influence, radicalize, recruit, and mobilize individuals and communities to terrorism and violent extremism. Countering radicalization and recruitment to violence is an essential counterterrorism tool. The U.S. governmen t's strategy to minimize the impact of terrorism and violent extremism includes efforts to build the capacity of local actors to address their drivers at the source. CVE requires a comprehensive rule -of-law-based and human -rights -respecting approach invol ving national and local governments, religious leaders, civil society, educators, women, youth, the private sector, and affected communities. In 2021, through bilateral and multilateral engagement, the Counterterrorism Bureau (the CT Bureau) emphasized fo ur key areas in strategy formulation, diplomatic engagement, and foreign assistance programming: 1) countering racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism; 2) countering the use of the internet for terrorist purposes; 3) rehabilitation and reintegr ation of foreign terrorist fighters and associated family members; and 4) strategic messaging. The CT Bureau partnered with government officials, community leaders, NGOs, mental health professionals and social workers, religious figures, and others to bui ld a prevention architecture to counter radicalization and recruitment to violence. Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremism The CT Bureau increased its efforts to combat racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism (REMVE). REMVE \u2014 in particular, white -identity terrorism \u2014 continues to be a threat to the global community, with violence both on the rise and spreading geographically, as white - supremacist and nativist movements and individuals increasingly target immigrants; Jewish, Muslim, and other religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and/or intersex individuals; governments; and other perceived enemies. The CT Bureau is working with law enforcement, civil society, social services, and foreign partners to take concret e actions to address this growing threat. In October the CT Bureau sponsored REMVE -focused workshops in Bratislava and Brussels to increase awareness of and political will to counter the threat from REMVE with European partners. Countering the Use of the Internet for Terrorist Purposes TheCTBureaucontinued promoting U.S. policy on this issue in bilateral and multilateral engagements. As global attention on preventing and countering terrorists' exploitation of internet -based platforms continues to grow ,theCTBureauworked to ensure the U.S. response was measured andaligned with U.S. policy and legal frameworks for internet freedom and freedom of expression. The United States believes that protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, including f reedom of expression, is an important part of our counterterrorism strategy because increased censorship and other restrictions on human rights can actually undermine counterterrorism efforts and lead to greater instances of terrorist radicalization. The CT Bureauplayed a leading role in coordinating and negotiating language thatpromotedU.S. policy consistent with our longstanding guiding principles. The United States endorsed the Christchurch Call to Action to Eliminate Terrorist and Violent Extremist Content Online in May,and theCTBureauworked to ensure the U.S. position was reflected in theG -7 Statement on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism and TerrorismOnline, as well as the G -20 leaders' statement.TheCTBureauengaged regularly wi th technology companies to improve voluntary information sharing, particularly on the presence of designated terrorist organizations and their members online, as well as terrorist trends and tactics.TheCTBureaualso engaged regularly with the industry -led Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT), including participating in a GIFCT working group, and UN - affiliated Tech Against Terrorism,demonstratingthe U.S. approach in working collaboratively with the private sector and other stakeholders su ch as civil society organizations to counter the use of the internet for terrorist purposes. Rehabilitation and Reintegration Rehabilitation and reintegration of former terrorist fighters and their family members has continued to bea pressing concern for the global community. TheCTBureaucoordinated global engagement on the rehabilitation and reintegration of FTF families repatriated from Syria and Iraq, though pandemic restrictions complicated these efforts.Thebureausponsored practitioner exchange s and partnered with the Government of Kazakhstan on a side event at the OSCE's counterterrorism conference in Vienna in March to share best practices on rehabilitation and reintegration. The CT Bureau also supported rehabilitation and reintegration train ing for civil society organizations in Indonesia. These engagements, which emphasized the importance of providing returnees with psychosocial services and involving community -level stakeholders in the reintegration process, led multiple countries to agree to repatriate their citizens and update their approaches to rehabilitation and reintegration, which could, in turn, encourage other nations to agree to repatriate their citizens from Syria and Iraq. Strategic Messaging The CT Bureau continues to work wit h the Global Engagement Center's Resiliency Campaign focused on Iraq, Syria, and Jordan as part of the Defeat -ISIS effort. This campaign focused on four areas: 1) creating a local environment inhospitable to ISIS; 2) sustaining global support to defeat I SIS; 3) portraying ISIS as another failed movement; and 4) reducing ISIS's ability to disseminate propaganda used to recruit, radicalize, or mobilize supporters. This campaign brought together elements within the U.S. Department of Defense to coordinate m essaging efforts within specified countries. The CT Bureau in coordination with Hedayah \u2014 the Abu Dhabi -based CVE Center of Excellence \u2014 trained and supported government and civil society officials from Kosovo and Kyrgyzstan in developing communication s trategies to complement CVE national action plans, building positive messaging campaigns, and developing interventions and better understanding of the use of the internet for terrorist purposes. ASEAN in 2019 adopted the Bali Work Plan to Prevent and Coun ter the Rise of Radicalizationand Violent Extremism 2019 -25. The objective of this workplan is to provide an implementation framework to guide relevant ASEAN sectoral bodies, organs, and entities in carrying out the necessary activities and monitor effec tiveness in preventing and countering terrorist radicalization and recruitment. In 2021 the CT Bureau, in coordination with ASEAN and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Office to ASEAN, supported programs that counter disinformation by providing consultations and presentations on media literacy and critical thinking skills in Indonesia. Regionally, in Southeast Asia, the CT Bureau also supported the USAID Office's program \"ASEAN Training of Trainers Program to Address Disinformation and Promote Media Literacy.\" International Platforms to Advance CVE In 2021theCTBureaumaintained robust support for key international platforms that serve to push global CVE initiatives, while sharing the burden of CVE programs with global partners. In the past year,theCTBureauhas helped multilateral institutions raise millions of dollars for local CVE programming in targeted localities. Strong Cities Network: The Strong Cities Network (SCN) launched in 2015 at the UN General Assembly with support from the United States. With 25 founding members, the SCN now includes more than 150 local governments across six continents. The SCN provides local governments with a forum to exchange best practices and lessons learned on CVE, including through global summits, regional workshops, exchanges, and an online portal. The London -based Institute for Strategic Dialogue serves as the SCN secretariat and conducts in -depth capacity building training and mentorship to members in Central Asia, East and West Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and the Western Balkans. With support from the United States, SCN members in Bangladesh, Kenya, and North Macedonia have developed local action plans, while engagement between U.S. mayors and th eir global counterparts will increase in 2022. Global Community Engagement Resilience Fund: The Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund (GCERF) supported 35 active grants in 14 partner countries: Albania, Bangladesh, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burkina Faso, Kenya, Kosovo, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, North Macedonia, the Philippines, Somalia, Sri Lanka, and Tunisia. In November, the CT Bureau participated in high -level site visits to Tirana, Albania, and to Kosovo to see the newly launched rehabilitation and reintegration (R&R) initiative in the Western Balkans. The CT Bureau also supported GCER F's efforts to establish a Regional Accelerated Funding Panel consisting of national governments, the donor community, and key actors in the R&R landscape to ensure effective coordination and impact in the Western Balkan region. Additionally, GCERF contin ued to increase its international donor base and contributions, with Niger joining as both a donor and recipient country. Since GCERF's inception five years ago, 17 international donors have provided roughly $150 million for the organization, complementin g U.S. contributions of about $21 million. In 2021, Niger became the first partner and donor country for GCERF. To date, several private sector organizations have provided in -kind contributions. Estimated conservatively, GCERF projects have reached 2.2 million direct beneficiaries and 13.2 million indirect beneficiaries. GCERF launched its 2021 -25 Replenishment Campaign, led by former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. Through this campaign, GCERF aims to raise an additional $120 million to provide better a lternatives for two million people directly at risk of radicalization and recruitment, and to build a safety net among 10 million other people in their communities in more than 20 countries. Hedayah: In 2021, Hedayah continued advising and assisting gove rnments and training civil society in CVE strategies and approaches, racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism, and rehabilitation and reintegration of foreign terrorist fighters and associated family members. Hedayah also continued to support Tu nisia and Tajikistan, to develop and disseminate countermessaging content for vulnerable communities, build resiliency to terrorist narratives to counter the use of the internet for terrorist purposes, improve government awareness of CVE strategic communic ation approaches, and assist governments in implementing their CVE national action plans. In direct response to the ongoing global need to address returning FTFs, Hedayah continued to promote its Blueprint of a Rehabilitation and Reintegration Center: Gui ding Principles for Rehabilitating and Reintegrating Foreign Terrorist Fighters and Their Family Members. In 2021, Hedayah raised almost $13 million for programs and operating expenses from donors including Australia, Japan, Spain, the UAE, the UK, the Un ited States, and the EU. Morebroadly,theCTBureauleveraged other U.S. and donor government support for Hedayah programming \u2014including USAID support for CVE communications work in Kenya. CivilianCounterterrorismCapacityBuildingPrograms As the terrorist threat has evolved and significantly expanded geographically in recent years, ithas become clear that mitigating this threat depends on the political will and enhanced capabilities of our partners to counter terrorism. To succeed over the long term, the UnitedStates must have partners who not only prevent, disrupt, and degrade networks militarily or through law enforcement \u2014 while comporting with international laws and norms \u2014 but also leverage robust civilian capabilities. The United States needs partners in law enforcement, the justice sector, and corrections that can prevent and disrupt attacks and investigate, arrest, prosecute, and incarcerate terrorists and their facilitation networks. The United States supports various programs to build partners' law enforcement capacity to counter terrorism, including by strengthening the ability of justice and corrections officials to counter terrorism. The CT Bureau funds, plans, and ove rsees capacity building programs that provide law enforcement and criminal justice officials with the tools needed to address security vulnerabilities and counter terrorist threats on their own. The Antiterrorism Assistance program The Countering Terrorism Finance program Counterterrorism Engagement With Allies The Terrorist Interdiction Program The Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund In 2021, CT resources allowed the Department of State to significantly expand civilian law enforceme nt counterterrorism capacity building activities with key partner nations in the Middle East, North Africa, the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, South and Central Asia, SoutheastAsia, and other regions to mitigate the threat posed by FTFs, prevent and counter t errorist safe havens and recruitment, and counter Iran -sponsored terrorism. Counterterrorism programs enabled multiple partner nations to pursue terrorist organizations and share information with U.S. law enforcement agencies charged with global counterte rrorism operations. Counterterrorism support strengthened security at airports and land borders, augmenting security for direct flights to the United States. CT programs also supported multilateral efforts to strengthen law enforcement and build CVE capa bilities. Recipient law enforcement organizations have used the skills and assistance to crack down on terrorists globally and save hundreds of lives from planned attacks. Rewards for Justice The Department of State's national security rewards program, Rewards for Justice (RFJ), was established by the 1984 Act to Combat International Terrorism, Public Law 98 -533 (codified at 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2708). Rewards for Justice is managed by the Diplomatic Security Service. RFJ's goal is to generate information that helps protect U.S. national security. Under this program, the Secretary of State may authorize reward payments to individuals who furnish information leading to the arrest or conviction of anyone for committing, or conspiring or attempting, or aiding or a betting, an act of international terrorism against U.S. persons or property; the prevention, frustration, or favorable resolution of an act of international terrorism against U.S. persons or property, including by dismantling an organization in whole or significant part; the identification or location of an individual who holds a key leadership position in a terrorist organization; or the disruption of financial mechanisms of a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Pursuant to legislative amendments, the Secret ary may also authorize reward payments to individuals who furnish certain other national security information related to the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and foreign election interference. Since RFJ's inception in 1984, the Secretary has authorized payments of more than $250 million through this program to individuals who provided actionable information that helped resolve threats to national security and continued to do so in 2021. To gene rate leads, RFJ issues reward offers for information covered by its statutory authority. In 2021 the RFJ program announced the following new reward offers for information: January 12. A reward of up to $7 million for information on Muhammad Abbatay, known as 'Abd al -Rahman al -Maghrebi. Al -Maghrebi is an Iran -based key leader of al -Qa'ida (AQ) and the longtime director of AQ's media arm, al -Sahab, and is the son -in-law and senior advisor to former AQ leader Ayman al -Zawahiri. March 29. A reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the location or identification of Salim Jamil Ayyash, a senior operative in the assassination unit of the terrorist organization Lebanese Hizballah, or information leading to preventing him from engaging in an act of international terrorism against a U.S. person or U.S. property. April 13. A reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the location, recovery, and safe return of U.S. citizen Abdulbari al -Kotf, who was taken from his home in Sana 'a, Yemen, in 2018.

A reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of anyone involved in the 2015 terrorist attack that left U.S. citizen Avijit Roy dead and his wife, Rafida Bonya Ahmed, seriously injured in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Throughout 2021, RFJ readvertised reward offers across the Middle East, Africa, and South and Central Asia, including Afghanistan, Algeria, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen, for: Informati on leading to the identification or location of terrorist senior leaders Information on those responsible for terrorist attacks or terrorism -related kidnappings Information leading to the disruption of Hizballah and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps financ ial networks Information on past, planned, or future attacks against U.S. diplomatic missions or personnel Support for Pakistan The United States continues to cooperate with Pakistan on regional security and counterterrorism. The U.S. government provides robust law enforcement, counternarcotics, and rule of law assistance for Pakistan, as well as limited defense, counterterrorism, and anti -money laundering assistance. The United States also continues to provide civilian assistance on a focused set of priorities. The United States and Pakistan cooperate to address COVID -19 and other infectious diseases, with the United States providing nearly 38 million COVID -19 vaccine doses and $35.4 million for COVID -19-related assistance in 2021. The United States also provides assistance to support trade and economic growth, including partnering with U.S. businesses, civil society, and the regions bordering Afghanistan. This assistance is intended to improve the lives of the Pakistani people and s upport U.S. objectives. The United States continues to support people -to-people exchanges to alleviate misunderstandings and complications in the bilateral relationship. The table below shows bilateral assistance provided to Pakistan for fiscal years FY 2019, FY 2020, and FY 2021.

In 2021, Saudi Arabia continued to be a premier counterterrorism partner of the United States. Saudi authorities worked closely with the United States to implement counterterr orism commitments and remained eager to enhance defense and security cooperation with the United States, including on countering violent extremism (CVE) issues. Regular high -level consultations and cooperation with the United States played a crucial role in the Saudi government's ability to address domestic and regional terrorism threats, and U.S. government -implemented programs helped Saudi Arabia increase its capacity to detect, deter, and respond to terrorist threats. Saudi Arabia maintained adequate l egal frameworks, security forces, and institutional preparedness to combat extremist threats. The main threat was the Iran -backed, Yemen -based Houthis, whose cross -border attacks on Saudi Arabia totaled over 400 in 2021, more than double the number of at tacks in 2020. Saudi Arabia remained a regional leader in countering terrorist financing, hosting the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center that brings together the United States and Persian Gulf region partners to confront new and evolving networks and le ad efforts on anti -money laundering and counterterrorist financing measures. On the multilateral front, Saudi Arabia worked closely on capacity building efforts to increase regional cooperation, minimize duplication of efforts, enhance information sharing , and address border security gaps. Saudi leadership worked to advance counterterrorism cooperation with Muslim -majority states, including through the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition. Saudi Arabia participated actively in the Global Coalitio n to Defeat ISIS and provided significant support in facilitating U.S. military operations in the region. Saudi CVE activities concentrated on identifying pathways to terrorist radicalization and recruitment with a heavy emphasis on the close monitoring o f social media and other internet activity. CVE institutions focused on refuting extremist interpretations of Islam, emphasizing nationalism, and cultivating appreciation for Saudi culture and heritage as the basis for national identity. Saudi Arabia's i deological approach to countering terrorist propaganda also included family outreach initiatives; integration of gender considerations in CVE work; and public messaging campaigns to amplify moderate voices in mainstream media, mosques, Islamic organization s, community centers, and prisons, to curb the appeal of radical ideology and to counter extremist messages. Security authorities continued to employ the Center for Counseling and Care to deprogram, monitor, and rehabilitate former Saudi terrorists or for eign fighters. With the goal of reducing the potential for interfaith extremism and terrorist acts, the Saudi government -affiliated Muslim World League promoted tolerance and encouraged interfaith dialogue through religious conferences and visits that bro ught Saudi religious scholars together with counterparts from other faiths to increase acceptance of other religions. The Saudi government made further progress in revising textbooks used in the public K -12 curriculum to reduce intolerant and extremist co ntent. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Call, and Guidance issued circulars to every Saudi mosque that included a directive to remove extremist literature and a prohibition on proselytizing. In contrast, antisemitic language was used in several Friday sermons at the Two Holy Mosques. Social, legal, economic, and political discrimination against the country's Shia minority continued. The Saudi government's potential use of terrorism laws to prosecute political dissidents remained a concern.

We refer you to http://ww w.usagm.gov/wp -content/uploads/2022/04/USAGM -CVE - Factsheet - 4-27-22.pdf for information on U.S. Agency for Global Media's outreach to foreign Muslim audiences. Visas for Participants in United States Programs The Depart ment of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs' visa policies and procedures have two fundamental missions: 1) protecting national security by helping secure U.S. borders against actual or potential threats, while 2) facilitating legitimate travel and interna tional exchange. Focusing on these two missions safeguards our nation's borders and ensures efficient adjudications of visa applications for individuals seeking to participate in visitor exchange programs. Visa applicants are subject to a thorough intera gency screening process that draws on biographic and biometric data. Some applications may undergo further interagency screening and vetting after the interview. Because of this, program sponsors and applicants should coordinate to initiate visa applicat ions well in advance of planned travel. We advise applicants to obtain passports immediately, as they must have a passport to apply for a visa. USAID Basic Education in Muslim -Majority Countries The U.S. Government Strategy on International Basic Education for Fiscal Years 2019 -23 (the Strategy) was released on September 14, 2018. The Strategy demonstrates the U.S. government's commitment to international education and presents an opportunity to advance global diplomatic and development leadership on pressing international educati on challenges, as called for in the Reinforcing Education Acc ountability in Development (aka READ) Act, Division 2, P.L. 115 -56. The goal of the Strategy is to achieve a world where education systems in partner countries enable all individuals to acquire the education and skills n eeded to be productive members of society. To accomplish this goal, the U.S. government has two principal objectives: 1) improve learning outcomes; and 2) expand access to quality basic education for all, particularly marginalized populations. The U.S. g overnment recognizes that its investments in international education serve as a force multiplier for all its work in international development. Strengthening education systems in developing countries advances U.S. foreign policy goals, promotes U.S. and i nternational security, and helps accelerate economic growth at home and abroad. Under the U.S. Government Strategy on International Basic Education, agencies and departments are working together to improve learning outcomes and expand access to quality ba sic education for all. The U.S. Government Support to Basic Education Map and the Fiscal Year 2020 U.S. Government Strategy Report to Congress highlight where the U.S. government is working, program education levels for each country, and examples of the type of coordination that is currently happening across agencies. The USAID Education Po licy, released in 2018, further articulates the Agency's vision and direction for supporting partner countries in strengthening their capacity to deliver quality learning opportunities for children and youth. The primary purpose of programming in education by USAID is to achieve sustained, measurable improvements in learning outcomes and skills development. The policy applies to education programming across all levels (from preprimary through higher education), contexts (stable contexts to crisis and conflict -affected environments), settings (formal and nonformal), and providers (state and nonstate). The principles laid out in the policy drive decision making for new education investments supporting the vision that partn er country education systems must enable all children and youths to acquire the education and skills needed to be productive members of society.

Chapter 5. Foreign Terrorist Organizations Designations of Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) expose and isolate the designated terrorist organizat ions, deny them access to the U.S. financial system, and create significant criminal and immigration consequences for their members and supporters. Moreover, designations can assist or complement the law enforcement actions of other U.S. agencies and gove rnments. In 2021 the Department of State designated Harakat Sawa'd Misr (HASM) \u2014 of (ISIS -DRC), ISIS -Mozambique , Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC -EP) \u2014 and Segunda Marquetalia as FTOs.

Established in 1988 the group helped finance, recruit, transport, and train fighters for the Afghan resistance against the former Soviet Union. AQ strives to eliminate western influence from t he Muslim world, topple \"apostate\" governments of Muslim countries, and establish a pan -Islamic caliphate governed by its own interpretation of Sharia that would ultimately be at the center of a new international order. These goals remain essentially unch anged since the group's 1996 public declaration of war against the United States. AQ leaders issued a statement in 1998 under the banner of \"The World Islamic Front for Jihad against Jews and Crusaders,\" saying it was the duty of all Muslims to kill U.S. citizens \u2014 civilian and military \u2014 and their allies everywhere. AQ merged with al -Jihad (Egyptian Islamic Jihad) in 2001. While numerous AQ leaders have been killed in recent years, including Usama bin Laden in 2011, AQ's current leader, Ayman al - Zawahir i, remains at large.

In 2015, five senior AQ leaders were released from Iranian custody in exchange for an Iranian diplomat kidnapped in Yemen. Of the five, Saif al Adel and Abu Mohammed al Masri are wanted fo r the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. In 2016, al -Zawahiri publicly released two audio messages and one seven -page statement, condemning the Government of Saudi Arabia and its role in the Syrian conflict, encouraging AQ activity in S outheast Asia \u2014 especially Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines \u2014 and acknowledging support for its affiliate in Syria, al -Nusrah Front.

Legislative Requirements and Key Terms Country Reports on Terrorism 2022 is submitted in compliance with Section 140 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (22 U.S.C. 2656f or the \"Act\"), which requires the Department of State to provide Congress a full and complete annual report on terrorism for those countries and groups meeting the criteria of the Act. Statutory excerpts relating to the terms used in this report and a discussion of the interpretation and application of those terms in this report are included below. Excerpts and Summary of Key Statutory Terms. Section 140 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (22 U.S.C. 2656f(a)) states as follows: (a) ... The Secretary of State shall transmit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, by April 30 of each year, a full and complete report providing - (1) (A) detailed assessments with respect to each forei gn country - (i) in which acts of international terrorism occurred which were, in the opinion of the Secretary, of major significance; (ii) about which the Congress was notified during the preceding five years pursuant to section 4605(j) of Title 50 [dee med under Section 1768(c)(2) of the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2019 (NDAA FY19) to refer to section 1754(c) of the NDAA FY19 as of August 13, 2018]; and (iii) which the Secretary determines should be the subject of such report; an d (B) detailed assessments with respect to each foreign country whose territory is being used as a sanctuary for terrorist organizations; (2) all relevant information about the activities during the preceding year of any terrorist group, and any umbrella group under which such terrorist group falls, known to be responsible for the kidnapping or death of an American citizen during the preceding five years, any terrorist group known to have obtained or developed, or to have attempted to obtain or develop, w eapons of mass destruction, any terrorist group known to be financed by countries about which Congress was notified during the preceding year pursuant to section 4605(j) of Title 50, any group designated by the Secretary as a foreign terrorist organization under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189), and any other known international terrorist group which the Secretary determines should be the subject of such report; (3) with respect to each foreign country from which the Unite d States Government has sought cooperation during the previous five years in the investigation or prosecution of an act of international terrorism against United States citizens or interests, information on - (A) the extent to which the government of the foreign country is cooperating with the United States Government in apprehending, convicting, and punishing the individual or individuals responsible for the act; and (B) the extent to which the government of the foreign country is cooperating in preventi ng further acts of terrorism against United States citizens in the foreign country; and (4) with respect to each foreign country from which the United States Government has sought cooperation during the previous five years in the prevention of an act of i nternational terrorism against such citizens or interests, the information described in paragraph (3)(B). Section 2656f(d) of Title 22 of the United States Code defines certain key terms used in Section 2656f(a) as follows: (1) The term \"international te rrorism\" means terrorism involving citizens or the territory of more than one country; (2) The term \"terrorism\" means premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against non-combatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents; and (3) The term \"terrorist group\" means any group practicing, or which has significant subgroups which practice, international terrorism. Interpretation and Application of Key Terms. For purposes of this report, the terms \"international terrorism,\" \"terrori sm,\" and \"terrorist group\" have the definitions assigned to them in 22 U.S.C. 2656f(d) (see above). The term \"non -combatant,\" which is referred to but not defined in 22 U.S.C. 2656f(d)(2), is interpreted to mean, in addition to civilians, military personn el (whether or not armed or on duty) who are not deployed in a war zone or a war -like setting. Notably, 22 U.S.C. 2656f(d) is one of many U.S. statutes and international legal instruments that concern terrorism and acts of violence, many of which use defi nitions for terrorism and related terms that are different from those used in this report. The interpretation and application of defined and related terms concerning terrorism in this report are therefore specific to the statutory and other requirements o f the report, and not intended to express the views of the U.S. government on how these terms should be interpreted or applied for any other purpose. Accordingly, there is not necessarily any correlation between the interpretation of terms such as \"non -combatant\" for purposes of this report and the meanings ascribed to similar terms pursuant to the law of war (which encapsulates the obligations of states and individuals with respect to their activities in situations of armed conflict). Statistical Informa tion. Pursuant to 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2656f(b), this report should contain \"to the extent practicable, complete statistical information on the number of individuals, including United States citizens and dual nationals, killed, injured, or kidnapped by each terror ist group during the preceding calendar year.\" This is satisfied through the inclusion of a Statistical Annex to the report that sets out statistical information provided by Development Services Group, Inc. (DSG). The Statistical Annex includes a discuss ion of the methodology employed by DSG in compiling the relevant data. This report does not contain statistical information specifically concerning combatants. The focus of the terrorism report, as is clear from the definition of terrorism, is on violenc e against non -combatant targets. Contextual Reporting. Adverse mention in this report of individual members of any political, social, ethnic, religious, or national population is not meant to imply that all members of that population are terrorists. Indeed, terrorists rarely represent anything other than a tiny fraction of such larger populations. It is terrorist groups \u2014 and their actions \u2014 that are the focus of this report. Further, terrorist acts are part of a larger phenomenon of violence inspired by a cause, and at times the line between the two can become difficult to draw. This report includes some discretionary information in an effort to relate terrorist events to the larger context in which they occur, and to give a feel for the conflicts tha t spawn violence. Thus, this report will discuss terrorist acts as well as other violent incidents that are not necessarily \"international terrorism\" and therefore are not subject to the statutory reporting requirement. Appendix B. Terrorism Deaths, In juries, and Kidnappings of U.S. Citizens Provided by the Bureau of Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of State The term \"Private U.S. citizen\" refers to any U.S. citizen not acting in an official capacity on behalf of the U.S.government; therefore, these figures do not include U.S. military personnel killed or injured in a terrorism -related incident while on active duty or employees of the Department of State and other federal agencieswhile overseas on U.S. government orders.Members of U.S. government employees' householdsand U.S. citizens working for contractors hired by the U.S. government, however,are consideredprivate U.S. citizens for purposes of this report. Although every effortwas madeto include all terrorism -related deaths and injuries involving private U.S. citizensoverseas, the figures below reflect only those cases reported to, or known by, the Department of State. These figures were acquired through consular systems. Embassies and consulates abroad report overseas dea ths in consular systems and specify the cause of death. Terrorism -related deaths are evaluated by first collecting those data and then contacting posts individually to determine whether there is sufficient official documentation to designate the death as terrorism related. These figuresmay not reflect actual numbers of injured, whichmay not always be reported,depending on the severity of injuriesand other factors.In the cases of Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, it is particularly difficult to gather co mprehensive information about all incidents and to distinguish terrorism from the numerous other forms of violence. 2021 (January 1 to June 30): U.S. citizensoverseaskilledas a resultof incidents of terrorism: 0 U.S. citizensoverseasinjured as a res ult of incidents of terrorism:0 U.S. citizensoverseaskidnapped as a result of incidents of terrorism:0 Terrorism Deaths of Private U.S. Citizens From January 1 to June 30, 2021 (by Country) Country Date of Death Number Location None N/A N/A N/A 2021 (July 1 31): a resultof incidents of terrorism: 0 U.S. citizensoverseasinjured as a result of incidents of terrorism:0 U.S. citizensoverseaskidnapped as a result of incidents of terrorism: 0 Terro rism Deaths of Private U.S. Citizens From July 1 to December 31, 2021 (by Country) Country Date of Death "}
