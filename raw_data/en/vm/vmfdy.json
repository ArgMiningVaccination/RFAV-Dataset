It aims to generate and detect early warning signals of impending outbreaks and help initiate an effective response in a timely manner to minimise the impact of outbreaks. Strengthening laboratory surveillance at the district level is an important component of this project. This docu ment aims to provide clear and concise information on laboratory confirmation of outbreak prone diseases as envisaged under the laboratory component of IDSP. It also strives to standardise specimen collection and processing of infectious human samples for the priority diseases under the project. The referral lab plan , currently being piloted in 9 states, aims to utilise the laboratory infrastructure and expertise available at medical colleges to diagnose and identify outbreaks in linked districts not havi ng access to functional district public health labs. A concept note regarding the referral lab plan and final plans of the 9 states are also annexed for ready reference. The manual , drafted by NCDC faculty and WHO experts, is based on the facilities prese ntly available in most public health laboratories at the district level. Therefore it emphasizes the practical aspects of the diagnostic tests to be done at the district public health laboratories. Quality assurance in laboratory services to improve the re liability of lab reports has also been stressed in this manual. Standard operative procedures (SOPs) are essential to ensure quality systems in laboratories and this manual provides a generalised SOP for the various tests under IDSP. This manual could be used as a template and modified as per local needs of the labs. Biosafety and biomedical waste manageme nt are also an important aspect of this manual and are intended to minimise healthcare associated infections, and safeguard the health of lab personnel. I hope this manual will be useful for the laboratory personnel at the district level and help to strengthen laboratory surveillance in India . 2 Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) was launched by Ministry of Health, G overnment of India in November 2004, in response to a long felt need expressed by various expert committees. IDSP is a decentralized, state based surveillance project in the country. It intend s to detect early warning signals of impending outbreaks and hel p initiate an effective response in a timely manner. The m ajor components of the project are : 1) Integrating and decentralization of surveillance activities 2) Strengthening of public health laboratories 3) Human Resource Development - Training of State Surveillan ce Officers, District Surveillance Officers, Rapid Response Team, other medical & paramedical staff & 4) Use of Information Technology for collection, collation, compilation, anal ysis and dissemination of data. IDSP is to accomplish these goals by working wi th the states to improve the completeness, reliability and timeliness of information collected at the peripheral levels of the health care systems. As a part of the component of strengthening public health laboratories, initially IDSP aimed to support labo ratories at 5 different levels starting from the Primary Health Centre. However, implementation experiences showed that due to limitations in availability and capacity of human resources, laboratory strengthening as envisaged was not possible. Many revisi ons in laboratory strengthening plan happened since then which resulted in confusion and incorrect comprehension at state levels. The laboratory cell of Central Surveillance Unit (CSU) has been pro -actively engaging the states for the final revision of the laboratory component, concentrating on basic and feasible actions. Currently, 50 district priority laboratories in the country are being strengthened for diagnosis of epidemic prone diseases. In addition, a referral lab network is being developed in nin e focus states by identifying the existing, functioning laboratories mainly in medical 2 colleges and linking them to the adjoining districts for outbreak investigations. Strengthening of 50 district priority labs Fifty district priority laboratories in th e country are being strengthened for diagnosis of epidemic prone diseases (the l ist of the se 50 labs is annexed ). These labs were identified by the respective state surveillance units (SSU). The labs are being strengthened with respect to procurement of de ficient equipments, hiring of a microbiologist, and provision of funds for consumables. The labs are expected to be able to perform the tests for the investigation of the epidemic prone diseases prevalent locally. To begin with these labs are expected to perform at least the following tests: Blood culture and s erological test for Typhoid (Typhi dot) Stool culture for cholera and other common enteropathogens IgM ELISA for Dengue (in endemic areas) ELISA / rapid test for Leptospirosis (in endemic areas) The functioning of these labs is being monitored through the reporting of their weekly data on L forms. Referral lab network Under this network, services of existing functional laboratories are being used to allow access to quality laboratory services for investigation of outbreaks in the linked districts. A concept note was provided by CSU to the states for drafting the referral lab network plan. The plans were finalized through state level meetings with all the stake holders. The implementation process involves certification of labs by team of experts from the state followed by signing of MoU between SSU and referral labs and disbursement of annual grant to the referral labs. The concept note on the referral lab network and the final referral lab plans for the 9 states are annexed. The referral labs are to be monitored through quarterly reports submitted by them to the SSU and the CSU (in prescribed format is annexed). To ensure success of the implementation, the project has provided guidelines and is f ocussed on obtaining laboratory test results useful for surveillance (e.g. outbreak confirmation, diagnosis of key IDSP diseases difficult to diagnose on clinical grounds), and assures continuous handholding at state and district level. Another important aspect of IDSP is to strengthen reporting of laboratory confirmed data using L form. All the referral labs under the lab network are also to report their weekly data using the L forms. 3 Efforts are required at the state and the district level to establish L form reporting from as many laboratories as possible in the state. IDSP aims to strengthen the quality of lab results by integrating competency based strengthening of technical capacities of the lab personnel and quality assurance activities. Nationwid e, district and state level microbiologists recruited under IDSP are being imparted training in techniques and quality assurance systems. Therefore, the Quality Assurance for public health laboratory testing is being supported by developing standard operat ing procedures, the external quality assessment system, biomedical waste management, development of guidelines for quality of kits as well as sample collection, transportation and handling. 4 Chapter 2 EPIDEMIC PRONE DISEAS ES UNDER IDSP CASE DEFINITIONS & LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS CHOLERA Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingestion of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae . Transmission occurs through direct faecal - oral contamination or through ingestion of contaminated water or food. The d isease is characterized in its most severe form by a sudden onset of acute watery diarrhoea that can lead to death by severe dehydration and kidney failure. The extremely short incubation period - two hours to five days - enhances the potentially explosive pattern of outbreaks, as the number of cases can rise very quickly. About 75% of people infected with cholera do not develop any symptoms. However, the cholera vibrios persist in their faeces for 7 to 14 days and are shed back into the environment, potent ially infecting other individuals. Cholera is an extremely virulent disease that affects both children and adults. Unlike other diarrhoeal diseases, it can kill healthy adults within hours. Individuals with lower immunity, such as malnourished children or people living with HIV, are at greater risk of death if infected by cholera. Clinical case description A patient with acute watery diarrhoea and severe dehydration (lethargy, altered consciousness and decreased urine output) with or without vomiting. Case classification Probable: In an area where the disease is not known to be present: Severe dehydration or death from acute watery diarrhoea in a patient aged 5 years or more In an area where Cholera is endemic: Acute watery diarrhoea, with or without vo miting in a patient aged 5 years or more. In an area where there is a Cholera epidemic: Acute watery diarrhoea, with or without vomiting, in any patient. Confirmed : A probable case that is laboratory confirmed 5 Laboratory criteria for diagnosis : Isolation o f Vibrio cholerae 01 or 0139 from the stools samples of any patient with diarrhoea. Key issues 1. Treatment of cholera does not depend on the results of laboratory examination. However, laboratory examination of specimens from the first few suspected cases is important to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the characteristics of the organism. 2. A sufficient number of stool specimens should be examined to identify the causative organism. Once the presence of cholera is confirmed, it is not necessary to examin e specimens from all cases or contacts . In fact, this should be discouraged since it unnecessar ily burden s the laboratory and is not required for effective treatment. 3. Specimens should be collected before the patient has received any antibiotics. 4. Full par ticulars of the patient(s) from whom samples have been collected must be sent along with the samples as many factors can influence the results of the laboratory tests. The information that should accompany each stool sample is given below: Name, age, sex Name of mother or father Address Date of onset of symptoms Provisional diagnosis Clinical outcome (recovered, under treatment, dead, not known) Antibiotic received prior to collection of sample - Y/N/not known Date of sample collect ion Notification of chol era cases 1. Cholera is endemic in India and several outbreaks of the disease have been reported. Because cholera has the potential of rapid spread leading to an acute public health problem, special attention is required to be given to the surveillance and pr ompt follow up action on reported cases of cholera. 2. A suspect case of cholera must be notified immediately by messenger, telephone or fax to the local health office. Weekly notification of confirmed cholera cases is required to be made by the state health authorities to the Directorate General of Health Services: Director, Central Bureau of Health Intelligence, Pushp Bhavan, Madangir Road, New Delhi - 110062 A copy should be endorsed to Director, National Centre for Disease Control (formerly known as Nati onal Institute of Communicable Diseases), 6 measures are taken, cholera remains rest ricted to a limited habitation. Therefore, reporting of taluka and dist rict help in identifying the affected area. 4. The first suspect case of cholera in the area must be notified immediately to the local health officer. Laboratory confirmation should be obtained at the earliest opportunity and the results intimated to local he alth office as soon as these become available. ENTERIC FEVER Enteric / typhoid fever is a septicaemia caused by Salmonella sp. In India, it is caused mainly by Salmonella typhi and less frequently by Salmonella paratyphi A. It manifests in the form of fever (step -ladder rise) accompanied with other symptoms like abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, loss of appetite, etc. Salmonella are gram negative bacteria , non acid -fast, non -capsulated and non -sporing motile bacilli , that grow rapidly on ordinary med ia and optimum temperature of growth is 37 C. Clinical case description Insidious onset of continu ous fever, headache, malaise and loss of appetite usually with gastrointestinal symptoms of more than one week duration having two or more of the following: Toxic look Coated tongue Relative bradycardia Splenomegaly Exposure to a confirmed case Clinical presentation with complications e.g. GI bleeding, perforation, etc Case definition s Probable case: A case compatible with the clinical description Confirmed case: A probable case that is laboratory confirmed by: Isolation of Salmonella typhi / paratyphi A from the blood or any other clinical specimen Serology Demonstration of four-fold rise in anti -salmonella antibodies in the patien t's serum 7 Detection of spe cific IgM antibodies DENGUE FEVER / DENGUE HAEMORRHAGIC FEVER Dengue infection is caused by one of the four dengue virus serotypes - dengue 1, 2, 3 or 4. Dengue virus belongs to the family Flaviviridae. Annually, dengue virus infections are responsibl e for up to 100 million cases of dengue fever and more than 500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Dengue viruses are transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Aedes mosquito. Once infected the mosquito remains infected for life, transmittin g the virus to susceptible individuals during feeding. Clinical case description of Dengue fever An acute febrile illness of 2 -7 days duration with 2 or more of the following : Headache Retro -orbital pain Myalgia Arthralgia Rash Haemorrhagic manifestation s Leucop aenia Probable case - A case compatible with clinical description and with one or more of the following: Supportive serology (comparable IgG EIA titre or positive IgM antibody test on a single acute (preferably after 5 days ) or convalescent -phase serum specimen Epidemiologically linked with a confirmed case of dengue fever (occurrence at the same location and time as other confirmed cases of dengue fever) Confirmed case Isolation of dengue virus from blood or tissue samples Demonstration of a four-fold rise in dengue specific antibody titres in paired serum samples Demonstr ation of dengue virus antigen in serum or tissue samples A female Aedes aegypti mosquito engorged with blood while feeding 8 Detection of viral RNA in blood or tissue samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Case definition of DHF A probable or confirmed case of dengue with the following signs: Haemorrhagic tendencies evidenced by one or more of the following: o Positive tourniquet test o Petechiae, ecchymoses or purpura o Bleeding from mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, injection sites etc o Haematemes is or melaena And thrombocytopenia (100,000 platelets or less per mm3) And evidence of plasma leakage due to increased vascular permeability, manifested by one or more of the following: o 20% rise in average haematocrit for age and sex o 20% drop in haematocri t following volume replacement treatment compared to baseline o Signs of plasma leakage (pleural effusion, ascites, and hypoproteinaemia ACUTE VIRAL HEPATITIS Acute v iral hepatitis is an inflammatory disease of the liver due to a viral infection and the most common cause is infection with one of 5 viruses, called hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. Of these , only hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are enterically transmitted. They cause acute and generally self limiting infections without any lo ng term carrier state. However, they cause significant morbidity and socio -economic loss in many parts of the world. Hepatitis A is caused by infection with the hepatitis A virus (HAV), a non-enveloped, positive stranded RNA virus, first identified by el ectron microscopy in 1973, classified within the genus hepatovirus of the picornavirus family. A typical positive result from a tourniquet test (>20 petechiae per square inch) 9 Hepatitis E is caused by infection with the hepatitis E virus (HEV), a non - enveloped, positive -sense, single stranded RNA virus, type species of the Hepevirus, genus within the family Hepeviridae. Mode of transmission Both HAV & HEV are transmitted from person -to-person via the faeco - oral route. HAV is abundantly excreted in faeces and can survive in the environment for prolonged periods of time . It is acquire d by ingestion of faeces -contaminated food or water. Direct person -to-person spread is common in poor hygienic conditions. Occasionally, HAV is also acquired through sexual contact (anal -oral) and blood transfusions. Hepatitis E is a waterborne disease, a nd contaminated water or food supplies are commonly implicated in major outbreaks. Clinical case description Acute illness compatible with following clinical description Jaundice Dark urine Anorexia, malaise Extreme fatigue and Right upper abdominal qua drant pain. Biological signs include increased urine urobilinogen and >2.5 times the upper limit of serum alanine aminotransferase Case classification Probable: As per clinical case definition Confirmed: A probable case that is laboratory -confirmed Hepatitis A : IgM anti -HAV positive Hepatitis E : IgM anti -HEV positive The mainstay of lab diagnosis rests on detecting IgM antibodies (against Hepatitis A or Hepatitis E virus) in blood of patients after 7 -10 days of the infection. 10 LEPTOSPIROSIS During the past decade many zoonotic diseases have emerged and resulted in epidemics causing significant morbidity and mortality in human beings in different parts of India's coastal belt due to the rapid ecological changes. Outbreaks of lep tospirosis have been reported from coastal districts of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andaman & Nicobar Islands. Cases been reported from Goa, Karnataka, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. States and union territories like West Bengal, Lak shwadeep , etc from where the disease has not been reported, may be affected in future. The deltas of Godavari, Krishna, Mahanadi and Cauveri in addition to Ganga may also be future potential areas for Leptospirosis. Infection is acquired through contact w ith the environment contaminated with urine of an animal that is a carrier or is suffering from the disease caused by leptospires. Infection may also arise from bathing or accidental immersion in the fresh water lakes, or rivers, contaminated with the urin e of the infected livestock that has been using the water for drinking or wallowing. Water may also get contaminated with rodent nests located on the banks especially after heavy rainfalls and inundations. Clinical case description Acute febrile illness w ith headache, myalgia and prostration associated with any of the following symptoms: Conjunctival suffusion Timing of sample is important when performing serologi c testing; IgM antibodies begin to r ise about a week after infection 11 Meningeal irritation Anuria or oliguria and / or proteinuria Jaundice Haemorrhages (from the intestine / lung ) Cardiac arrhythmia or failure Skin ra sh AND History of exposure to infected animals or an environment contaminated with animal urine Other common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrh oea, and joint pains . Case classification Probable: A case that is compatible with the cl inical description Confirmed: A probable case that is laboratory confirmed. Laboratory diagnosis depends on: 1. The isolation of leptospira from clinical specimens confirms the clinical diagnosis. Isolation is recommended from blood or CSF during first week of illness and from urine after 10 days. Leptospires can be isolated from: Blood Urine CSF Aqueous humo ur Amniotic or peritoneal fluids or Autopsy tissues such as kidney or liver 2. Serological diagnosis Leptospira agglutination test, preferably Microsc opic Agglutination Test (MAT) IgM ELISA / other IgM antibody tests MEASLES Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by the m easles virus , which is a paramyxovirus belonging to the genus Morbillivirus. It is a leading cause of death among young chi ldren globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine. Measles virus spreads by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact or direct contact with nasal or throat secretions from an infected person. It can also spread by airborne aer osolised droplet nuclei or by contact with freshly contaminated articles. It is a highly communicable disease, with a secondary attack rate of 90 % among susceptible persons. It can be transmitted by an infected individual 12 from four days prior to the onset of the rash to four days after the rash erupts. Clinical case description Any person with: Fever, and Maculo -papular (i.e. non -vesicular) rash lasting for more than 3 days and Cough or coryza (i.e. running nose) or conjunctivitis (i.e. red eyes) Case c lassification Probable: A case that meets the clinical case description Confirmed: a case compatible with clinical description and is laboratory confirmed or linked epidemiolog ically to a lab confirmed case Laboratory diagnosis depends on Isolation of me asles virus OR A four -fold rise in serum antibody titre OR Presence of measles -specific IgM antibodies ( without a history of recent vaccinat ion) MENINGOCOCCAL MENINGITIS Meningitis is an infection of the meninges, the thin lining that surrounds the brai n and the spinal cord. Several different bacteria can cause meningitis and Neisseria meningitidis is one of the most important because of its potential to cause epidemics. Meningococcal disease was first described in 1805 when an outbreak swept through Ge neva, Switzerland. The causative agent, Neisseria meningitidis (also 1887. Thirteen subtypes or serogroups of N. meningitidis have been identified and four ( N. meningitidis A, B, C and W135) are recognized to caus e epidemics. Likewise in our country, the commonest serogroup involved in meningococcal meningitis is 'A' followed by 'C'. Early diagnosis of meningitis is essential to initiate appropriate intervention for the patient as well as the community. Th e pathog enicity, immunogenicity and epidemic capabilities differ according to the serogroup. Thus , the identification of the serogroup responsible of a sporadic case is crucial for epidemic containment. Measles rash 13 Transmission is from person to person via droplets of respira tory or throat secretions. Close and prolonged contact (e.g. kissing, sneezing and coughing on someone, living in close quarters or dormitories (sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc) facilitate the spread of the disease. The incubation period is 4 days , ranging from 2 to 10 days. N. meningitidis only infects humans; there are no animal reservoirs. Between 10 to 25% of the popula tion are carriers of N. meningitidis , but the carriage rate may be much higher in epidemic situations. Clinical case descripti on An illness with sudden onset of fever (>38.5\u00b0C rectal or >38.0\u00b0C axillary) and one or more of the following: Neck stiffness Altered consciousness Other meningeal signs (Kerning / Brudzinski sign positive) Petechial or purpural rash Ongoing epidemic and epidemiological link to a confirmed case In infants , suspect meningitis when fever is accompanied by bulging fontanel les. Case classification Probable: A case that meets the clinical case description , with Turbid CSF, OR Ongoing epidemic and epidemiologic al link to a confirmed case of meningitis Confirmed: A suspect or probable case with laboratory confirmation: Positive CSF antigen detection , OR Positive culture from CSF or blood DIPHTHERIA Diphtheria is an acute infectious disease primarily of upper r espiratory tract but occasionally of skin also. It is caused by toxigenic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae , which are gram positive, nonendospore forming pleomorphic rods. The dividing cells are folded together to form V and Y shaped figures resembli ng Chinese letters. Presence of polyphosphate metachromatic granules is a characteristic feature of this bacterium. With Albert 's stain, the metachromatic granules stand out purple black against the green stained protoplasm . There are three biotypes of th is organism - gravis, intermedius and mitis. Recently , a fourth biotype - belfanti has also been described. Characteristically , C. diphtheriae causes a typical form of infection 14 which is manifested by a greyish -white membrane at the site of the localizatio n of organisms. The disease begins with a sore throat and fever, followed by general malaise and swelling of the neck. This organism produces a powerful exotoxin capable of damaging the heart, kidney and muscles. Some toxigenic strains of Corynebacterium ulcerans can also cause diphtheria. Though, the diagnosis of diphtheria is mainly clinical, laboratory is required to confirm the diagnosis, which is based on demonstration of the causative organism in the lesion. A presumptive diagnosis can be made on th e basis of demonstration of the bacilli in the affected lesion by microscopic examination, but confirmation requires a positive culture. Transmission is by d irect person -to-person contact or by intimate respiratory and physical contact. Clinical case des cription An illness of the upper respiratory tract characterized by laryngitis or pharyngitis or tonsillitis and adherent membranes of tonsils, pharynx and / or nose Case classification Probable: A case that meets the clinical case description Confirmed: A probable case that is laboratory confirmed or linked epidemiologically to a laboratory confirmed case Laboratory diagnosis depends on isolation of toxin producing strain of Corynebacterium diphtheria e from membrane / lesion of a probable case . 15 Chapter 3 INVESTIGATION OF AN EPIDEMIC An e pidemic is defined as an \" unusual occurrence in a community or region of disease or, specific health related events clearly in excess of the expected occurrence \". The term outbreak is used to refer to a localized epidem ic. The objectives of an epidemic investigation are : 1. To define the magnitude of the epidemic/outbreak in terms of time, place and person 2. To determine the factors responsible for the occurrence of the epidemic 3. To identify cause , sources of infection and modes of transmission , to determine measures ne cessary to control the epidemic 4. To make recommendations to prevent future recurrences Steps in the investigation of an epidemic 1. Verification of diagnosis : this is the first step, and a quick verification will h elp confirm the diagnosis, and thus prevent misinterpretation of signs & symptoms by the lay public or a wrong diagnosis by any spurious laboratory reports. Laboratory investigations should be used to confirm the diagnosis wherever possible. 2. Confirmation of existence of an epidemic : This is done by comparing the disease frequencies during the same period of previous years in that particular population in the community. An arbitrary limit of two standard deviations is used to define the epidemic thresholds for common diseases such as influenza. 3. Defining the population at risk a) Obtaining a map of the area: Before beginning any investigation it is necessary to have a detailed and current map of the area. The map should contain information regarding natural lan d marks, roads, and location of all dwelling units along the roads, or in isolated areas. The area may be divided into sections and all dwelling units be numbered in the sections. b) Counting the population: Entire population or subgroups may be involved in t he epidemic. However, it is prudent to undertake a complete census of the whole population by age and sex which will later on help to calculate the 16 attack rates for that particular disease in various age groups. For this purpose lay health workers in suff icient numbers may be employed. 4. Rapid search for all cases and their characteristics a) Medical survey : A medical survey should be carried out in the defined area to identify all cases including those who have not sought medical care. Ideally screening all members of the population will identify all the affected individuals. An epidemiological case sheet or questionnaire is used to collect all relevant data. b) Epidemiological case sheet : The epidemiological case sheet/case interview form should be carefully de signed to collect all relevant information. This includes: name, age, sex, occupation, social class, travel history, history of previous exposure, time of onset of disease, signs & symptoms of the illness, personal contacts at home, work/school, any specia l events like parties attended, food eaten, history of receiving injections or blood products. The information collected should be relevant to the disease under study. In case of a large outbreak, it is not possible to interview all the cases, a random sa mple should be examined. c) Searching for more cases : The patient may be asked about his/her contacts, and if they know about any similar cases. Cases admitted to local hospitals should also be taken into consideration. Search for new cases should be carried out everyday till the area is declared free of epidemic. This period is usually is taken as twice the incubation period of the disease since the occurrence of the last case. 5. Evaluation of ecological factors : Ecological factors which have made the epidemic possible should be investigated. This includes sanitary status of eating establishments, water and milk supply, movements of human population, atmospheric changes such as temperature, humidity, air pollution etc. This will enable us to know the sources of infection, reservoirs and modes of transmission. 6. Further investigation of population at risk : To gather additional information about the population under study, further study in the form of medical examinations, examination of suspected food, faeces or b lood, assessment of immunity status etc. should be done. The approach may be prospective or retrospective. Healthy individual may be studied in the case control fashion. This will allow classification of all members as per 17 a) exposure to specific potential ve hicles b) whether ill or not 7. Data analysis : The data collected should be analysed on ongoing basis, using epidemiological parameters - time, place and person. If the disease agent is known, the disease can be described based on the agent -host-environment mod el. a) Time : Prepare a chronological distribution of dates of onset and construct an 'epidemic curve'. Look for time clustering of cases. An epidemic curve may suggest i) A time relationship with expo sure to suspected source. ii) Whether it is a common source or pr opagated epidemic . iii) Whether it is a seasonal or cyclic pattern suggestive of a particular infection. b) Place : Prepare a spot map (geographic distribution) of cases and if possible their relation to possible sources of infection e.g. water supply, air pollutio n, foods eaten, occupation etc. Clustering of cases may indicate a common source of infection. c) Person : Analyse the data by age, sex, occupation and other possible risk factors. Calculate attack rates/case fatality rates for those exposed and those not expo sed. 8. Formulation of hypothesis : On the basis of time, place and person distribution or Agent -Host-Environment , formulate a hypothesis to explain the epidemic in terms of a) Possible source b) Causative agent c) Possible modes of spread d) Environmental fact ors which enable it to occur. This tentative hypothesis should further guide the investigation. 9. Testing of the hypothesis : All reasonable hypotheses need to be considered and weighed by comparing the attack rates in various groups for those exposed and those not exposed. This will help to ascertain whether the hypothesis is consistent with all the known facts or not. 10. Writing the report : The report should be complete. Information to be included in the final report include a) Background : Geograph ical location Climatic conditions Demographic status Socioeconomic situation 18 Organization of health services Surveillance , etc. b) Historical data : Previous occurrence of epidemics, occurrence of related disease , etc. c) Methodology of investigation : This includes case definition, questionnaires used in survey, survey teams, type of survey, collection of any laboratory specimens , etc. d) Analysis of data : This includes analysis of clinical data, epidemiological data, modes of transmission, laboratory data and fin ally involves the interpretation of data. e) Control measures: Definition of strategies and methodology of implementation, evaluation of control measures. 19 Chapter 4 COLLECTION , TRANSPORT & STORAGE OF SPECIMEN S The ap propriate selection, collection , rapid transport and processing of specimen s is very important for microbiologic diagnosis. When sample collection and management are not priorities the laboratory can contribute little to patient care / community health. Consequently all members of the staff invo lved in the process must ensure the critical nature of ensuring quality. It is the responsibility of the laboratory to provide complete and accurate specimen management information to the health care workers who have the primary responsibility of collectin g the specimens. The information provided should address safety, selection, collection, storage, labelling, transportation and acceptability . Safety Biosafety in the laboratory is of primary concern to the laboratories. Healthcare workers may be unaware of potential etiologic agents residing in the specimen being transported to the laboratory. To protect the safety of the healthcare worker collecting the sample and laboratory personnel, the following precautions must be followed when collecting specimens: During specimen collection wear personal protective equipment such as gloves, laboratory coat and where appropriate, a mask and / or goggles. Use leak -proof specimen containers and transport bags that have a separate outside compartment for the test requ isition form. Never transport syringes with needles to the laboratory. Instead, transfer the contents to a sterile tube or remove the needle with a protective device, recap the syringe, and place it in a sealable, leak proof plastic bag. Make sure screw -cap lids are fastened evenly and securely. Ensure that no label material is caught in the threads of the lid. Do not transport leaking containers to the laboratory because test results will be compromised and it is a hazard to couriers and laboratory person nel. To protect the safety of others, take care not to contaminate the outside of the specimen container or the laboratory requisition form. General specimen selection and collection guidelines: 20 Wash hands before and after the collection . Aseptic techniqu es must be employed during collection to prevent the introduction of micro -organisms into the patient's anatomical space, and to prevent the sample from being contaminated during collection. Avoid contamination from indigenous flora, whenever possible, to ensure a sample representative of the infectious process. Collect specimens before the administration of antimicrobial agents. Collect the specimen at the appropriate stage of disease. Make certain that the specimen is representative of the disease. Selec t the correct anatomic site from which to obtain the specimen, and collect the specimen by the recommended technique. Collect adequate volume, as insufficient material may yield false negative results. Collect the specimen in an appropriate screw capped , external threaded, unbreakable, leak-proof container. Ensure that the outside of the specimen container is clean and uncontaminated. Close the container tightly so that its contents do not leak during transportation. Label the container appropriately and c omplete the requisition form. Arrange for immediate transportation of the specimen to the laboratory Table 4.1 - Specimens to be collected Probable diagnosis Trigger event Sample collection / storage / transport Acute watery diarrhoea A single case of cho lera or epidemiologically linked case of diarrhoea / a case of severe dehydration or death due to diarrhoea in a patient >5 yrs old Clustering of cases particularly village or ward where >10 houses having at least 1 case of loose stools irrespective of age Collect freshly passed stool in a clean, wide mouthed container. Ideally collect within 48 hours of onset of diarrhoea Transport stool specimen quickly to the laboratory, in case of delay store at 4 -8C for 48 hrs and transport in Cary Blair medium. In ca se of delay beyond 2 days store in freezer at -20C Typhoid More than 30 cases of prolonged fever a week from the entire PHC or 5 or more cases per week from 1 sub centre OR More than 2 cases from a single village/urban ward with 1000 population Blood sam ple is collected for culture & serology For blood culture collect the required volume of venous blood aseptically (5 -10 ml for adults, 1 -2 ml for children) and transfer carefully to blood culture bottle containing TSB broth. Transfer immediately to lab, taking care to avoid spillage. In case of delay store in an incubator at 37 C for up to 24 hrs For serology collect a paired serum sample - first sample early in the disease preferably within 3 days & second sample 10 -15 days later 21 Jaundice Clustering of ca ses from a particular village/urban ward where more than 2 cases of jaundice in different households or more than 10 cases per PHC per week Collect blood sample for etiologic diagnosis of the causative agent of jaundice Separate serum sample for d etection of antibodies to HAV & HEV Measles A single case of probable measles from a tribal or remote area, or two or more cases with fever with rash The virus can be isolated in the early stages of the disease from upper respiratory tract specimens like nasophary ngeal aspirate Blood is collected for detection of specific IgM antibodies Dengue DF/DHF Even a single case of suspected DHF from a community Rising number of fever cases for previous 3 weeks Paired serum sample s are collected to demonstrate rising levels of anti-dengue antibodies Meningitis 2 cases with fever with altered consciousness / seizures CSF is to be collected by a trained physician or a medical officer Collect about 1 -2 ml CSF in each of the 3 collection vials for cell counts, biochemical & mi crobiological investigations Do Gram staining, culture and antigen detection from the microbiological specimen CSF for bacteriology should never be frozen, transport ed or store d at room temperature - store in an incubator , if available . CSF for virus detec tion can be stored at 4 -8C Collect blood sample for culture Storage & transportation of specimens In genera l samples should be kept at 2 -8\u00b0C during storage and transport except the CSF samples collected from cases of pyogenic meningitis , which can be st ored at room temperature or in the incubator . The quality of sample can deteriorate during storage or transportation which affects the diagnostic results. Hence, special care should be taken during transport of samples to the laboratory to protect them fro m heating or drying. All specimens must be promptly transported to the laboratory, preferably within 2 hours. Specimens for bacterial culture should not be stored for more than 24 hours before transport to the laboratory. Specimens suspected to yield envir onmentally sensitive organisms Haemophilus influenzae (which sensitive to cold temperatur es) should not be refrigerated. Specimen containers relating to single case investigation should be placed in a plas tic bag with an absorbent material surrounding the specimen so that even if the whole specimen leaks out, it will be absorbed . The lab report form should be sealed within a separate plastic bag and wrapped round the specimen or attached firmly to box of specimens. The material should be packed in an insulated carton / carrier to transport a specimen to the lab. 22 All specimens should be considered as potentially pathogenic and accordingly labe lled with internationally accepted biohazard label. Avoid repeated thawing & freezing of specimens. For transportation it should be placed in a triple container system : Primary container which has the specimen and is leak proof with a screw cap. Secondary container made of durable, waterproof material with a screw cap, w ith an absorbent material surrounding the specimen so that even if whole specimen leaks out, it will be absorbed. Tertiary container is usually made of wood , plastic or cardboard . It should be capable of withstanding the shocks and trauma of transportation . Dry ice can be kept between this and the secondary container along with sufficient absorbents . As an alternative, follow triple packaging method described in the \"Manual of Laboratory Techniques for Dist rict Public Health Laboratories\". Specimen acce ptability or rejection criteria At times, specimens arriving in the laboratory may have been improperly selected, collected or transported. Processing and reporting such specimens may provide misleading information that can lead to misdiagnosis and inappro priate therapy. Consequently, the laboratory must adhere to a strict policy of specimen acceptance and rejection. The following are some examples under which samples could be rejected in the laboratory : No label Improper or leaking container Prolonged t ransport Insufficient quantity Specimen collecte d in an inappropriate container Contamination suspected Inappropriate transport or storage Haemolysed / lipemic serum sample 23 In all the above cases, immediately contact the submitting health care worker. For specimens collected by non invasive means , have a new specimen submitted, but for invasive specimens or for other samples which cannot be collected again, process the specimen only after consulting the person who obtained the specimen. Note the problem on the form and report. Label ling and identification of specimens Proper identification of every patient sample is as important as the quality of the sample. Each patient should be given a unique identification number. This unique identification number and t he patient name should be present on all specimens, epidemiological data forms, and the laboratory transmittal forms and used as a common reference. The sample should be labelled using pre-printed labels / glass -marking pencil / permanent markers / adhesiv e tape, etc. L abels should be firmly affixed to the specimen container. It should contain the following : Patient's name Identification number Specimen type Date & time of collection Glass slides for microscopy must be labe lled individually, using glass marking pencil. This should not interfere with the staining process. Each slide should bear: Patient's name Identification number Date of collection Collection of specimens Some of the important specimens and their proper collection and transportation meth ods are described here so as to ensure quality. 1. Blood specimen s Blood and separated serum are the most common specimens taken to investigate outbreaks of communicable disease. Venous blood can be used for isolation and identification of the pathogen in cul ture, serum for the detection of specific antibodies, antigens, or toxins (e.g. by ELISA /other serological assay) . For the processing of most specimens for diagnosis of viral pathogens, serum is preferable to whole blood except 24 where otherwise directed. Wh en specific antibodies are being assayed, it is often helpful to collect paired sera, i.e. an acute sample at the onset of illness and a convalescent sample one to four weeks later. Blood can also be collected by finger prick for the preparation of slides for microscopy or for absorption onto special filter paper discs for analysis. Whenever possible, blood specimens for culture should be taken before antibiotics are administered to the patient. Venous blood samples Materials for collection: Skin disinfecti on: 70% alcohol (isopropyl alcohol, ethanol) or 10% povidone iodine, swabs, gauze pads, band aid Disposable gloves Tourniquet, disposable syringes and needles Sterile screw -cap tubes for collecting blood Sterile screw cap tubes for storage of separated serum Blood culture bottles (50ml for adults, 25ml for children) with appropriate media for identification of bacterial pathogen by culture method Labels and marker pen Performing vene puncture for blood culture Label the collection container before commen cement of venepuncture Wear gloves Use sterilized / sterile disposable syringes and needles Apply a tourniquet and palpate arm for suitable vein After the vessel site is selected, a 5 cm area of skin should be disinfected with 70% alcohol by swabbing conc entrically outward from the venepuncture site The site should be cleansed once again, with 10% povidone - iodine , again in a concentric motion , from inside outwards . Allow the iodine to dry completely before performing venepuncture (this should take 1 - 2 minutes) Prepare the blood culture bottles by applying labels and cleaning the tops with 70% alcohol before starting the procedure 5-10ml of blood should be withdrawn from the puncture site for one bottle Inoculate the blood culture bottle/s. Do not chang e needles between venepuncture and inoculation of the bottles, or between bottles. The risk of needle -stick injury is increased, while the chance of contamination is not significantly lessened Discard needle and sy ringe in an appropriate manner 25 Clean the t op of the blood culture bottles with an alcohol wipe to remove any residual blood Invert bottl es so that clots will not form Table 4.2 - Volume of blood to be collected at different ages Age Ideal v olume in each of 2 bottles < 2 years 1 ml 2-10 years 5 ml >10 years 10 ml Blood for serological testing1 Using the materials and methods described above , draw 5-10 ml of venous blood and transfer to a screw c ap tube without anti-coagulant The v ial for collecting blood should be sterile, dry and properly labelled After drawing blood, the needle should be removed from the syringe before transferring blood from syringe to the sterile tube Let the specimen clot for 30 minutes at am bient temperature; do not shake Then place in a cool box for clot retraction at 4-8\u00b0C, for a minimum of 1 - 2 hours If facilities for separation of serum are not available, then it should be refrigerated at 4 C (not frozen ) Otherwise centrifuge @1 500rpm for 10 minutes (ensure that the centrifuge is in good condition and the tubes are properly closed and balanced to avoid breakage and spilling ) Separate the serum aseptically from the clot using a disposable transfer pipette Transfer equally to 2 plastic screw cap tubes Secure the caps tightly Handling and transport If serum will be requi red for testing, separation from blood should take place as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours at ambient temperature 1 In case blood cultures are also collected simultaneously, the blood culture bottles should be inoculate d first. Separation of serum from clotted blood sample 26 If the specimen will not reach a laboratory for processing within 24 hours, serum should be separated from blood prior to transp ortation Sera may be stored at 4 -8\u00b0C for up to 10 days If testing is delayed for a long peri od, serum samples may be frozen If separation on site is not possible, or is inadvisable for safety reasons, the blood sample should be stored at 4 -8\u00b0C (whole blood samples should not be frozen) Protect such samples from excessive vibration while transporting 2. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimen The specimen must be taken by a physician experienced in the procedure. CSF is used for diagnosis of viral, bacterial, para sitic, and fungal meningitis. Handling and transport CSF is collected in properly labelled sterile screw -cap tubes. Specimens should be delivered to the laboratory and processed as soon as possible . If the samples cannot be promptly transported, separat e tubes should be collected for bacterial and viral processing. CSF specimens for bacteriology are tran sported at ambient temperature CSF should never be refrigerated for bacterial culture (bacteria like N. meningitides , Strept. pneumoniae and H. influenza e are thermo -labile) CSF specimens for virology do not need transport medium (they may be transported at 4 -8\u00b0C) 3. Faecal specimen Faecal specimens may be collected in the early stages of a disease, when pathogens are likely to be present in the stool in hi gh numbers i.e. soon after on set of diarrhoea (for viruses <48 hours and for bacteria < 4 days), and preferably before the initiation of antibiotic therapy. Stool specimens should be collected in a wide -mouthed sterile container with a leak -proof screw -capped lid. The collec ted stool should be processed a s soon as possible upon receipt in the laboratory. In case of delay ed transport (> 2 hours ), collect a small amount of stool on a swab and inoculate Cary -Blair transport medium. Stool is the preferred speci men for culture in a case of diarrh oea. 27 Rectal swab may be collected for acutely ill patients, newborns or when stool specimen is not available. It is advisable to collect two swabs from each patient, one for microscopy and other for bacterial/viral studie s. Materials required Sterile wide mouth , external threaded, unbreakable, leak proof container Spatula for transferring the specimen to the container Transport medi um (e.g. Cary Blair 's) if delay in transport is suspected Collection of rectal swab Moisten 2 swabs in an appropriate transport medium (e.g. Cary -Blair). Insert swab 2-3 cm into rectum and gently rotate. Gently rotate u p to 90 degrees, so that faeces covers the swab . Withdraw the swab. After collection of both swabs (one at a time ), place both swabs into the same tube deep enough so that medium covers the cotton tips. Break off top portion of sticks and replace the cap Label the specimen and place it in a plastic bag wi th the appropriate request slip . Collection and Transport of Stoo l Samples Label the specimen container clearly with patients name and date of collection Collect freshly passed liquid stool. Place a separate clean container with a wide opening, or plastic wrap in the toilet bowl and transfer enough faeces with spatula to at least half fill the specimen container . Collection of stools from bed -pans is not recommended Alternatively, c ollect a rectal swab by using a sterile cotton tipped swab Send the sample to the laboratory in a tightly sealed screw capped sterile bottl e, in a sealed bag If delay of more than two hours is anticipated, swab the stool sample collected and put the swabs into Cary -Blair medium (for bacterial pathogens ) - should reach laboratory in 2 -3 days time; can keep at RT Preserve/Transport collected s ample at room temperature if cholera is suspected , otherwise transport in cold conditions 28 4. Respiratory tract specimen Specimens are collected from the upper or lower respiratory tract, depending on the site of infection. Upper respiratory tract pat hogens (viral and bacterial) are found in throat and nasopharyngeal specimens. Lower respiratory tract pathogens are found in sputum specimens. When acute epiglottitis is suspected, no attempt should be made to take throat or pharyngeal specimens since the se procedures may precipitate respiratory obstruction. Materials Required Transport media - bacterial / viral Dacron and cotton swabs Tongue depressor Flexible wire calcium alginate tipped swab (for suspected pertussis) Nasal speculum (for suspected pertus sis - not essential) Suction apparatus or 20 -50 ml syringe Sterile screw -cap tubes, and wide -mouthed clean sterile jars (minimum volume 25ml) Upper respiratory tract specimens - Throat swab Hold the tongue down with the depressor Locate areas of inflammati on and exudate in the posterior pharynx and the tonsillar region of the throat behind the uvula using a good light source Rub the area back and forth with a Dacron or calcium alginate swab Withdraw the swab without touching cheeks, teeth or gums and insert into a screw -cap tube containing transport medium Break off the top part of the stick without touching the tube and tighten the screw cap firmly Label the specimen containers Lower respiratory tract specimens - Sputum Collect an early morning sample after rinsing the mouth with water Inoculation of rectal swab into Cary Blair's medium 29 Instruct the patient to inhale deeply 2 -3 times, cough up deeply from the chest and spit in the sputum container by bringing it closer to the mouth This should be done in the open or away from other people Make sure the s putum sample is of good quality - a good sputum sample is thick purulent and sufficient in amount Avoid saliva or postnasal discharge Minimum volume should be about 1 ml Label the specimen containers Handling and transport All respiratory specimens except sputum are transported in appropriate bacterial / viral transport media Transport as quickly as possible to the laboratory to reduce overgrowth by commensal oral flora For transit periods up to 24 hours, transport bacterial specimens at ambient temperat ure and viruses at 4 -8\u00b0C in appropriate media 30 Chapter 5 STANDARD OPERATIVE PROCEDURES CHOLERA CULTURE Equipments & Supplies Glass sli des: 75 x 25 mm size, 1.35 mm thick, 50 slides / box Coverslips: 18 x 18 mm size, no 1 size ; 10 g (about 50 coverslips )/packet, 20 packets / box Amber coloured storage bottles Rectal swab: made up of ab sorbent cotton wool, sterilized Related material Dehydrated culture med ia like TCBS, MacConkey agar Transport media - Alkaline peptone water / Cary Blair media Disposable petri plates, 88 -90 mm diameter, polypropylene, individually wrapped, pre -sterilized and disposable Antisera - Vibrio cholerae antisera, poly 01 & 0139 -Bengal Accessories - loop holder, n ichrome wire , discarding jar with disinfectant Processing of Sample Macroscopy - Gross examination sho uld be recorded for all samples. Colour Consistency - solid (S), semi formed (SF) , or watery Abnormal constituents - blood, mucus, worms , etc. Microscopy Wet mount : Put one drop saline along with a loopful of the sample in the centre of a glass slide and put a cover slip; examine under 10X/40X objective of a microscope. Lo ok for pus cells, RBCs, trophozoites, etc. Experienced observer can also recognise darting motility in this preparation. Hanging drop : In case of wate ry sample, place a loop of plasticine on the coverslip and then place a drop of the stool sample on the cover slip at the centre of the plasticine loop. I nvert the cover slip over a slide . Examine the edge of the drop under high power to look for darting motility suggestive of Vibrio cholerae. Culture The TCBS (Thiosul phate Citrate Bile of Vibrio cholerae Alkaline Peptone water: Selective enrichment of Vibrio cholerae (subculture on MacConkey and TCBS after 6 hours of incubation from the surface pellicle, without shaking) Methods for Vibrio isolation For stool culture preferably use bio safety level 2 cabinet along with all aseptic precautions including gloves and masks Select fresh culture plates (preferably < 7 days old) Dry culture plates at 37\u00b0C incubator for about half an hour Label all culture plates and liquid media tubes and arrange them Label all the plates Take a loopful of stool specimen with Nichrome wire loop & make a primary well on MacConkey agar plate & TCBS Sterilize Nichrome loop in blue portion of Bunsen burner flame , and cool the loop Do primary streaking, followed by h eat steriliz ation / cooling of the loo p; re-streak in parallel lines so as to isolate separate sin gle colonies as far as possible Incubate at 37 \u00b0C incubator for 24 h ours Next day observe colony morpholo gy on media plate Also, inoculate enrichment broth (APW) after labelling the same Incubate the inoculated APW tube at 37 \u00b0C and subculture on to TCBS media within 4 to 6 hours on incuabtion Cultural characteristics MacConkey Agar: After 18 -24 Colonies of V. cholerae o n TCBS medium Plating technique for getting isolates colonies on 32 hours at 37\u00b0C, suspected vibrio like colonies are pale or nearly colo urless, 1 -3mm in diameter, mois t, flat, circular and smooth . These are catalase and oxidase positive . TCBS: After 18 -24 hours at 37\u00b0C, the colonies are flat, yellow and shiny . These are oxidase positive . Subculture the suspect Nutrient agar or Mueller Hinton (MH) Agar for reconfirmation of oxidase test and performing the slide agglutination test using Vibrio cholera antiserum . Stock all isolates in good quality nutrient agar Identification tests Gram stain (for details refer annexure 5) Place a drop of normal saline on a labelled, clean glass slide and emulsify a small portion of suspected vibrio like colony Once the smear is dry, heat fix it and stain On examination under oil immersion 100X objective small, curved gram negative (GN) rods will be seen Oxidase Tes t (for details refer annexure 7) Pick a speck of colony (from MacConkey agar / TCBS ) using a glass rod & smear it on the filter paper Development of purple colour within 30 seconds is indicative of positive oxidase reaction Check reagent using positive and negative controls Slide agglutination test for confirmation of Vibrio cholerae (using poly O1 and O139 antisera) Inoculate suspected looking colony on non - selective agar (NA/MH) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 hrs; the growth obtained is then used for slide agglutination test Take out cholera antisera from the refrigerator and bring it to room temperature For carrying out slide agglutination test , take 2 -3 clean glass slides Make them grease free by cleaning with cotton & then passing over flame s everal times ; cool the slide Oxidase test (positive) 33 All sera manipulation are to be done in an aseptic manner in clean area so as to prevent antisera contamination Take two drops of normal saline with Nichrome wire loop and put over a clean glass slide - side by side Pick up a suspected colony with a straight wire and emulsify in both the saline drops one by one Check for auto - agglutinability i.e. formation of coarse granules without the addition of antisera In case of rough strain , auto -agglutinability will be observed - in such a case, no further serotyping should be attempted In case the strain is smooth & forming a smooth suspension, add a drop (small) of cholera antiserum (Poly O1) Look for clumping i.e. formation of coarse granules which indicate agglutination In case th ere is no agglutination with Poly O1 V. cholerae antisera, repeat the steps with O139- Periodically check antisera with known Vibrio cholerae O1 and O 139 strains Inform laboratory incharge for further action or public heath measure s in ca se cholera is diagnosed at district level laboratories Antimicrobial susceptibility testing The stocked strains of Vibrio cholera must be sent to the referral lab for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The isolates can be referred for re-confirmation with detailed characterization and epidemiological analysis. A loop may be used to make a suspension for slide agglutination tests Saline control (left) ensures validity of the test ; agglutination seen on the right 34 Flowchart for processing stool for Cholera Inoculate control antiserum If positive, report as V. cholerae O1 isolated If negative for O1, then test with O139 antiserum If O139 positive : send isolate to reference lab for confirmation Antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disc diffusion method on Mueller -Hinton agar Screening Tests: Oxidase Test : positive Gram : small, curved , GN rods Reconfirm with Oxidase Test and Gram stain Faecal specimen Stool specimens should be plated on MacConkey and TCBS as soon as possible after arrival at the laboratory Enrich in APW for 6 -8 hours at 35 - 37C and subculture on MacConkey & TCBS Macroscopic examination of growth on solid media shows colonies typical of V. cholerae 35 TYPHOID CULTURE Blood, stool and urine are the clinical samples from which the causative agent of typhoid can be isolated. However, the isolatio n rate is different at different stages of disease . The best isolation rates from blood have been seen in the first week of illness, with faeces in the second week and with the urine in the third week of illness. Two serum samples are collected at an inter val of at least 10 -14 days to demonstrate a four fold increase in antibody titre. Blood culture Out of the many clinical samples that can be used for culture, blood culture is the most informative. Blood samples of suspected septic aemia patients are collected before the first dose of antibiotic is given. There shouldn't be any delay in transferring the sample into the bottles to get a better yield. The organisms will soon be exposed to the nutritive medium which facilitates their growth and also the eff ect of any antibiotic or the antibodies of the host will be reduced because they get diluted in the broth. TSB broth should contain sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS). Liquoid / SPS is an (paediatric) 50 ml (adult ) of Tryptic Soya containing SPS Culture Media: Agar, MacConkey Agar Procedure Collect blood sample aseptically , as described in chapter 4 . Send the bottles to the laboratory immediately (do not refrigerate ) The blood culture bottles are shaken gently for proper mixing and aeration, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C; after 24 hours of incubation inspect for any signs of microbial growth wit hout shaking If there is a layer of sedimented red blood cells at the bottom covered by transparent pale yellow broth culture, it is considered to be sterile All blood culture bottles are subcultured on B lood agar & Mac Conkey agar after 24 hours and 48 hou rs of incubation , irrespective of turbidity All negative samples are incubated for seven days. Before discarding, a final subculture is done and findings are recorded. Media Length of incubation (hours) 36 TSB broth 7 days - subculture after 24 & 48 hours, or when turbidity appears Blood agar 24 & 48 MacConkey 24 & 48 Cultural characteristics MacConkey Agar: After 18 -24 hours at 37\u00b0C, the colonies are pale yellow or nearly colourless, 1 -3mm in diameter, moist, circular and smooth convex surface Biochemical reactions (S. typhi / S. paratyphi A) (for details refer to Annexure 6 & 7) Catalase - positive Oxidase - negative Indole test - negative Urease - negative Citrate - positive (S. typhi ) & negative (S. paratyphi A ) TSI (Triple sugar iron) Slant Butt Species Lactose / Sucrose Glucose Gas H2S S. typhi - (pink) + (yellow) - + (trace) S. paratyphi A - (pink) + (yellow) + - Slide agglutination If on the basis of biochemical reactions, the organism has been identified as Salmonella, its identity can be confirmed with slide agglutination test, using polyvalent 'O' and polyvalent For , monovalent 'O' specific antiserum for S. typhi is factor 9 and for S. paratyphi A is factor 2 . Take out antisera from the refrigerator and bring them to room temperature. Take clean glass slide s & make them grease free by passing over flame several times ; cool the slide Take two drops of normal saline with Nichrome wire loop and put on sides of a clean glass slide Pick up a suspected colony with a straight wire and emulsify in both the saline drops one by one so as to obtain uniform suspension s Check for auto -agglutinability i.e. formation of coarse granules without the addition of antisera 37 In case auto -agglutinabili ty is observed, no further serotyping should be attempted In case the strain is smooth (forming a smooth suspension ), add a drop (small) of polyvalent ' O' antiserum against salmonella Rotate slide for one minute and look for clumping i.e. formation of coar se granul es which indicate agglutination If this gives visible agglutination within two minutes, the process is repeated with polyvalent 'H' antiserum a nd then with factor 9 antiserum Precaution - all sera manipulation are to be done in an aseptic manner i n clean area so as to prevent antisera contamination Antimicrobial susceptibility testing The emergence and spread of S. typhi resistant to multiple antibiotics has assumed a massive public health problem . Multi -drug resistant typhoid fever has become en demic in many developing countries. Thus conventional antibiotics such as chloramphenicol , ampicillin and cotrimoxazole can no longer be considered as the first line drugs in the treatment of typhoid fever. Each and every isolate of S. typhi should be subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility test ing, as it will help in the management of the patient more efficiently and also in generating surveillance data which will be useful to formulate an antibiotic policy in a given hospital. Stool culture Stool cultur e should be attempted in second or third week Rectal swabs give infer ior results than faeces culture Culture on XLD agar gives good results in i solating salmonella from faeces TYPHI -DOT TEST FOR TYPHOID Using TyphiDot test, diagnosis of fever caused by Salmonella typhi can be made in a short time (within 1 hour of collecting the sample). The test can be performed using a single sample of blood / serum. The test can be easily performed in a district laboratory without the need of any sophisticated equipm ents. The presence of IgM and IgG antibodies made against a specific antigen on the outer membrane of Salmonella typhi are detected by incubating nitrocellulose strips dotted with the specific antigen protein with the patient 's sera and control sera. To vi sualise the antigen -antibody complex, the strips are simultaneously incubated with peroxidase -conjugated antihuman IgM & IgG upon addition of the chromogenic substrate, the results can be read visually. Positive reading is indicated by the blue colo ur as intense as or more intense tha n that of the positive control. Reagents and material provided with the kit 38 TyphiDot contains reagents and antigens dotted strips for detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies to Salmonella typhi , inclusive of controls Use of sterile disposable pipette tips is recommended Do not use kit beyond expiration date and do not mix reagents from different batch num bers Note: Store kit at 2 -8oC. Allow kit to warm to room temperature (minimum 23oC) before doing the test.

Divide the reaction tray into columns. Mark one column as 'M' and another column as 'G' 2. Using forceps, remove the pr edotted antigen strips and place them with the marked side up onto a filter paper 3. Align all antigen strips with the marked side on your right 4. Using a ball -point pen, for each serum sample, label one strip as M and other as G 5. Perform similarly for positive and negative controls (Make sure that there is an IgM and an IgG strips (2 strips) for each patient or control serum ) 6. Add 250 ul of sample diluent into the appropriate 'M' and 'G' reaction wells 7. Place the 'M' or 'G' strips into the appropriate reaction wel ls 8. Shake tray gently to al low strips to be thoroughly wet 9. To the appropriate 'M' or 'G' reaction well, add 2.5 ul of either control or test serum to achieve a final serum dilution of 1:100 10. Gently aspirate the solutions 11. To avoid cross -contamination, use a n ew sterile disposable pipette tip for each specimen 12. Make sure all membranes are with the marked side up, fully immersed in the first antibody solution 13. Incubate at room temperature on a rocker platform (optional) for 20 minutes 14. Shake the tray gently, every 5-10 minutes if a r ocker platform is not available 15. Aspirate the first antibody solution into a discard jar containing a disinfectant 40 16. Add 250 l of prepared washing buffer into each well and wash 3 times, each for five minutes 17. Using sterile micropipettes tips, add 250 ul of prediluted anti - Human IgM (B1) into the 'M' well and 250 l of prediluted anti - Human IgG (B2) into the 'G' well 18. Cover the tray with aluminium foil and incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature (min 23 \u00b0C) on a rocker platform 19. Aspirate the second antibody solution and wash 3 times for 15 minutes as d escribed earlier 20. Add 250 l of the colo ur development solution into each well 21. Cover the tray and incubator on the rocke r platform 22. Allow 1 5 minutes for colour development 23. Stop the reaction by aspirating the solution and briefly rinsing the strips in distilled water (3times) 24. Place similarly coded strips for IgM and IgG for each patient and test control onto filter paper to dry - interpret the results (see guided interpretation charts) If interpretation cannot be done immediately, store the strips submerged in distilled water for up to 1 day 25. After use, rinse the tray thorough ly with distilled water 26. Store dry for re -use 27. For a permanent record, paste the dried membranes in the relevant position on the worksheet provided Interpretation Basic Principles - To interpret the TyphiDot the colo ur intensity of the dots produced by the test sera must be equivalent to or greater than those of the positive control. Reading TyphiDot result depends entirely on your observation of the intensity of each dotted antigens after colo ur development. There are few very important principles to rememb er. 41 Always compare each IgM test with that of the positive IgM control strip. Similarly, compare the IgG test strips with that of the IgG positive control strips. When comparing colo ur intensity, compare the dot on the left of the test strips with the do t on the left of the positive control. Similarly, compare the colo ur intensity on the right of the strips (next to the line marked on the strips) with the colo ur intensity of the dot on the right of the positive control strip. Only when both dots on the te st strips are as dark as or are darker than their corresponding dots on the positive control strips, the result is reported as \"positive\" If one of the dots on the test strips is lighter compared to the corresponding dot on the positive control strips, the result should be reported as \"negative\" If you are not sure i.e. borderline cases, ask for the repeat serum specimen one or two days later Note: The strips should have a white background with only 2 dots appearing where applicable . The test should be repeated under the following conditions If the strips show a blue background m aking interpretations difficult If the colour intensity of the negative control is similar to that of the positive control If the colour intensity of the test serum is high but not equal to the positive control (request for a second serum specimen at least 2 days later so that a higher serum tit re would be available for detection). 42 TyphiDot Results and Clinical Interpretation Result Clinical interpretation IgM positive only Acute enteric fever IgM and IgG positive Acute enteric fever (in the middle stage of infection) IgG positive and IgM negative Implications for the presence of IgG antibodies include previous infection (in which case current fever may not be due to typhoid), or relapse or re -infection, therefore it is important that interpretation be made together with clinical symptoms IgM and IgG negative Probably not enteric fever ELISA FOR DENGUE & CHIKUNGUNYA Collection, storage and transportation of samples 1. Collect ion of samples for isolation of Dengue virus (transportation to referral laboratory ) Specimens that may be suitable for virus isolation include: Acute phase serum Plasma Washed buffy coat from the patient Auto psy tissues especially liver, spleen, lymph nod es & thymus Mosquitoes collected in nature These samples should be immediately transported (within 48 hours) to referral laboratory in an ice box. 2. Sample for serology Collect a blood sample as soon as possible after the onset of illness. (This is called t he acute serum, S1) Collect a second blood sample 10 -14 days after first sample or in the event of a fatality, at the time of death (convalescent serum, S2) Serological diagnoses are predicted on the identification of changes in antibody levels over time Serial (paired) specimens are required to confirm or refute a diagnosis of acute flavivirus or dengue infection. Blood collection in tubes or vials and transportation Aseptically collect 2 -10 ml of venous blood. The name of the patient, identification numb er and date of collection must be indicated on the label of the tube. Transport specimens to the laboratory in an ice box as soon as possible. If there is more than a 24 -hour delay before 43 specimens can be submitted to the laboratory, the serum should be se parated from the RBCs and stored frozen. Serological tests Serological tests carried out for diagnosis of dengue are: o Dengue IgM ELISA test o Dengue IgM & IgG Rapid Strip Test DENGUE IGM ELISA TEST The kits are commercially available and the manufacturer' s instructions as per kit insert should be strictly adhered to. The following protocol refers to the Dengue kit from the National Institute of Virology. Principle IgM antibodies in the patient's serum are captured by anti - human IgM ( chain specific) that are coated on to the solid surface of the wells. Then the dengue antigen is added which binds to captured IgM, if the antigen and IgM are homologous . Unbound antigen is removed in the washing step and subsequently, biotinylated flavivirus cross -reactive m onoclonal antibody (Hx -B) is followed by Avidin -HRP. Addition of substrate / chromogen followed by development of colour and the reaction is stopped by 1N H 2SO4. The optical density readings are taken at 450nm and are directly proportional to the amo unt of Dengue specific IgM antibodies in the sample.

Expected values for th e positive & negative control & interpretation of the results will be as per the product insert. Please amend the assay procedure as per the literature supplied in the kit. The procedure of the Chikungunya ELISA should also be similarly adapted from the kit literature. ELISA FOR HEPATITIS A & E A number of commercial immunoassays for HAV specific IgM & HEV specific IgM are available. Perform the test according to manufacturer's instructions. Collection Transport and Storage of specimens Either human serum or plasma may be used 45 If the assay is performed within 48 hrs of sample collection, the sample should be kept at 2 -8C, otherwise they should be aliquoted and stored deep -frozen IgM ELISA - HAV Principle The assay is an antibody -capture; non -compe titive test based on the use of polystyrene microwells coated with mouse monoclonal antibody to human IgM and an enzyme tracer containing horseradish peroxidase -labelled mouse monoclonal antibody to HAV. In the assay procedure, patient sample and controls are incubated in antibody -coated microwells. IgM antibodies present in a sample or control bind to the antibody. Excess sample is removed by a washing step and a solution of hepatitis A virus and enzyme tracer are then added to microwells and allowed to incubate. The presence of IgM anti -HAV enables the HAV and the enzyme tracer to bind to the s olid phase. Excess enzyme tracer and HAV removed by washing step, and a chromogen/substrate solution is added to microwells and allowed to incubate. If sample co ntains IgM anti -HAV, the bound enzyme (horse radish peroxidase) chemically reduces the substrate peroxide which concurrently oxidizes to chromogen tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) to a blue colour (650 nm). The blue colour turns to yellow (450 nm) after additi on of stop solution. If the sample does not contain IgM anti -HAV, the microwells will be colourless after the substrate solution is added and will remain colourless after stop solution is added. Colour intensity, which is measured spectrophotometrically by the ELISA reader , is indicative of the presence of IgM anti HAV. Absorbance value readings for patient sample are compared to cut -off value determined from the mean of calibrators.

The procedure of the IgM HEV ELISA should also be similarly adapted from the kit literature . RAPID TEST FOR LEPTOSPIROSIS Leptospira agglutination test The Lepto Tek Dri -Dot is used for rapid screening for leptospirosis. The assay is aimed at the detection of Leptospira -specific antibodies in human sera. The following assay refers to the procedure of the LeptoTek Dri -Dot test. Principle Coloured latex particles - dried and activated with a broadly reactive Leptospira antigen are provided on an agglutination card. The assay is based on the binding of Leptospira specific antibodies, presen t in the serum sample to the Leptospira antigen causing a fine granular agglutination that tends to settle at the edge of the droplet (positive result). The broadly reactive antigen allows the detection of Leptospira infections caused by a wide range of st rains of different serovars. When no specific antibodies are present the blue suspension will remain homogeneous (negative result). Sample Fresh serum samples are preferred. But samples can be stored for a longer period at -20\u00baC. Dri -Dot cards can be st ored at 2 -4\u00baC in a dry place protected from direct exposure to the sun. Requirements 10\u00b5l micropipette Disposable pipette tips Procedure Take out a Dri -Dot card from the packaging and place the card on a bench top w ith the blue dot facing upwards Spot 10 \u0000l serum next to the blue dot and within the area marked by the black circle Break off a spatula and hold with the flat surface facing downwards Hold the spatula with thumb and forefinger close to the flat end of the spatula 48 Suspend the blue dot in the se rum with a quick circular motion while pressing the flat end of the spatula on to the dot Do not spread the suspension outside the area marked by the black circle Proceed with the next step when the blue dot is fully suspend and a homogeneous suspe nsion is obtained 1. Suspending of the blue dot with the spatula should only take a few seconds 2. The suspension should not be spread outside the area marked by the black circle, as spreading over a large surface w ill hamper the mixing procedure Keeping the card near h orizontal slowly rotate the card swirling the liquid in a circular motion in order to further mix latex and serum sam ple and to induce agglutination Read result within 30 seconds after start of mixing 1. Always read the result within 30 seconds, otherwise fal se results may occur 2. As with any diagnostic assay, results from the Lepto Tek Dri Dot should be interpreted with consideration of the clinical, epidemiological and other labor atory findings Reading of results Aggregation of the latex particles of the test dot reveals agglutination by Leptospira specific antibodies present in the serum samples The degree of agglutination depends on the amount of specific antibodies in the sample which is relative to the stage of the disease as well as on other factors The s ensitivity of the assay is highest for samples collected 10 to 30 days after the onset of the disease Strong agglutination visible within 30 seconds is highly consistent with current or recent leptospirosis As antibodies reach detectable levels about one w eek after the onset of the disease, a serum sample collected very early in the disease may fail to cause agglutination in this assay If the assay performed on a serum sample collected in the early phase of the disease is negative, and suspicion of leptospi rosis remains It is advised to examine a second sample collected some days after the first sample As with any diagnostic assay, results from the Lepto Tek Dri Dot should be interpreted with consideration of the clinical, epidemiological and other laborator y findings Leptospira ELISA Test ELISA test is an enzyme immunoassay for the detection of antibodies to Leptospira biflexa for the serological confirmation of infections in serum, and plasma. The kits are commercially available and manufacturer's instruct ions should be strictly followed. 49 DIRECT DETECTION OF MENINGOCOCCI IN CSF (GRAM STAINING & LATEX AGGLUTINATION ) Collection, storage and transportation of specimen Cerebrospinal fluid Collect CSF before commencement of antimicrobial therapy , but treatment must not be d elayed pending lumbar puncture The collection of CSF is an invasive procedure and should be performed only by experienced personn el under aseptic conditions Send the CSF to laboratory as early as possible preferably within an hour Do no t expose the CSF to s unlight or extreme heat or cold Never pipette CSF by mouth Never freeze or refrigerate the CSF in suspected pyogenic meningitis It is preferable to make a smear for direct demonstration of organisms from CSF a t the time of collection i tself Culture as rapidly as possible ; in case of delay incubate at 37\u00b0C CSF is a precious specimen since a repeat is extremely difficult to ob tain Blood Blood cultures from young children should have 1-2 ml of blood i n 20 ml of broth (1:10 to 1:20 diluti on) Blood cultures from adults should have 5-10 ml of blood in 50 ml of broth (1:5 to 1:10 dilution) Immediately transport the inoculated media to the laboratory All blood -culture bottles should reach the laboratory within 12 to 18 hours for subculture and should be protected from tempe rature extremes (<18\u00b0C & >37\u00b0 C) Extended culture is preferred and the inoculated media should not be discarded before seven days of incubation Petechial Fluid Samples that can be collected include: Cereb rospinal fluid Blood Petechial fluid (in cases with meningococcaemia) 50 Petechial lesions, if present may be gently irrigated by injectin g 0.2 ml of sterile saline solution using a small syringe with a fine needle and the f luid re-collected for making smea r and doing culture examination CSF examination Macroscopic examination - Gross examination sho uld be recorded for all samples Colour Presence of turbidity, deposit or clot.

Samples negative for measles may be screened for Rubella IgM antibodies. Principle The ELISA method is b ased upon the reaction of antibodies in the sample tested with the antigen adsorbed on the polystyrene surface. An enzyme -labelled anti -human globulin binds the antigen -antibody complex in a second step. After a washing step, bound conjugate is developed w ith the aid of a substrate solution to render a blue coloured soluble product which turns into yellow after adding the acid stopping solution. Perform the test according to manufacturer's instructions. All reagents, except washing solution are ready to us e. Serum dilution solution and conjugate are coloured.

Thi s ability may be estimated by either the dilution method or the diffusion method . Dilution method The dilution method is used for quantitative estimation of antibiotic activity. Dilutions of the antibiotic may be incorporated into broth or agar medium, which is then inoculated with the test organism. The lowest concentration that prevents growth after overnight incubation is known as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the agent. This MIC value is then compared with known concentrations of the drug obtainable in the serum and in other body fluids to asses the likely clinical response. Diffusion method This is the routinely used method in most diagnostic laboratories. Paper discs, impregnated with the antibiotic, are placed on agar medium unifo rmly seeded with the test organism. A concentration gradient of the antibiotic forms by diffusion from the disc and the growth of the test organisms is inhibited at a distance from the disc that is related, among other factors, to the susceptibility of the organism. 56 Clinical definition of terms \"resistant\" and \"susceptible\" The result of the susceptibility test, as reported to the clinician, is the classific ation of the microorganism in one of two or more categories of susceptibility. The simplest system comprises only two categories: susceptible and resistant. This classification, although offering many advantages for statistical and epidemiological purposes , is too inflexible for the clinician to use. Therefore, a three -category classification is often adopted. The Kirby -Bauer method and its modifications recognize three categories of susceptibility and it is important that both the clinician and the laborat ory worker understand the exact definitions and the clinical significance of these categories. Susceptible : An organism is called \"susceptible\" to a drug when the infection caused by it is likely to respond to treatment with this drug at the recommended d osage . Intermediate : This covers two situations. It is applicable to strains that are \" moderately susceptible \" to an antibiotic that can be used for treatment at a higher dosage because of its low toxicity or because the antibiotic is concentrated in the f ocus of infection (e.g. urine). The classification also applies to strains that show \" intermediate susceptibility \" to a more toxic antibiotic that cannot be used at a higher dosage. In this situation, the intermediate category serves as a buffer zone betwe en susceptible and resistant. As most clinicians are not familiar with the subtle, although clinically important, distinction between intermediate and moderate susceptibility, many laboratories use the designation \"intermediate\" for reporting purposes. 57 Resistant : This term implies that the organism is expected not to respond to a given drug, irrespective of the dosage and of the location of the infection For testing the response of staphylococci to benzylpenicillin, only the categories \"susceptible\" and \"r esistant\" (corresponding to the production of -lactamase) are recognized. The ultimate decision to use a particular antibiotic, and the dosage to be given, will depend not only on the results of the susceptibility tests, but also on their interpretation by the physician. Other factors, such as pathogenic significance of the microorganism, side -effects and pharmacokinetic properties of the drug, its diffusion in different body sites, and the immune status of the host, will also have to be considered. Indication for routine susceptibility tests A susceptibility test may be performed in the clinical laboratory for two main purposes: Guide the clinician in selecting the best antimicrobial agent for an individual patient Accumulate epidemiological information on the resistance of microorganisms of public health importance within the community Susceptibility tests as a guide for treatment Susceptibility tests should never be performed on contaminants or commensals belonging to the normal flora, or on other orga nisms that have no causal relationship to the infectious process. For example, the presence of Escherichia coli in the urine in less than significant numbers is not to be regarded as causing infection, and it would be useless and even misleading to perform an antimicrobial susceptibility . Susceptibility tests should be carried out only on pure cultures of organisms considered to be causing the infectious process. The organisms should also be identified, as not every microorganism isolated from a patient wi th an infection requires antimicrobial susceptibility testing to be done . Susceptibility tests as an epidemiological tool Routine susceptibility tests on major pathogens ( S. typhi , Shigella sp) are useful as part of a comprehensive programme of surveillan ce of enteric infections. They are essential for informing the physician of the emergence of resistant strains (chloramphenicol -resistant Shigella sp) and of the need to modify standard treatment schemes. 58 Once isolated colonies are available from an organism that has been identified as a potential pathogen, it is necessary to proceed as follows to perform the susceptibility test. 1. Select colonies 2. Prepare inoculum suspension 3. Standardize inoculum sus pension 4. Inoculate plate 5. Add antimicrobial disks 6. Incubate plate 7. Measure zone inhibition diameter s 8. Interpret results Kirby -Bauer method Reagents Mueller -Hinton agar (MHA) o MHA should be prepared from a dehydrated base according to the manufacturer's recomme ndations. The medium should be such that control zone sizes within the published limits are produced. It is important not to overheat the medium. o Cool the medium to 45 -50\u00baC and pour into the plates. Allow to set on a level surface, to a depth of approxima tely 4 mm (a 9-cm plate requires approximately 25 ml of medium ). When the agar has solidified, dry the plates for immediate use for 10 - 30 minutes at 35 C, by placing them in the upright position in the incubator with the lids tilted. o Any unused plates may be stored in a plastic bag, which should be sealed and placed in the refrigerator. Plates stored in this way will keep for 2 weeks. o Quality control - To ensure that the zone diameters are sufficiently reliable for testing susceptibility to sulfonamides and co-trimoxazole, the Mueller -Hinton agar must have low concentrations of the inhibitors thymidine and thymine. Each new lot of Mueller -Hinton agar should therefore be tested with a control strain of Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212 or 33186) and a disc of co-trimoxazole. A satisfactory lot of medium will give a distinct inhibition zone of 20 mm or more that is essentially free of hazy growth or fine colonies. Antibiotic discs Any commercially available discs with the proper diameter and potency can be used . Stocks of antibiotic discs should preferably be kept at -20\u00baC; the freezer compartment of a regular refrigerator is convenient. A small working supply of discs can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. On removal from the refrigerator, the conta iners should be left at room temperature for about 1 hour to allow the temperature to equilibrate. This procedure reduces the 59 amount of condensation that occurs when warm air reaches the cold container. Do not use disc s beyond their expiry dates. Turbidi ty standard Prepare the turbidity standard by pouring 0.6 ml of a 1% (10 g/litre) solution of barium chloride dehydrate into a 100 -ml graduated cylinder, and filling to 100 ml with 1% (10 ml/litre) sul phuric acid. The turbidity standard solution should be placed in a tube identical to the one used for making the suspension . It can be stored in the dark at room temperature for 6 months, provided it is sealed to prevent evaporation. Swabs A supply of cotton wool swabs on wooden applicator sticks should be pre pared. They can be sterilized in tins, culture tubes, or on paper, preferably by dry heat. Procedure To prepare the inoculum from the primary culture plate, touch with a loop the tops of each of 3 -5 colonies, of similar appearance, of the organism to be t ested. Transfer this growth to a tube of saline. When the inoculum has to be made from a pure culture, a loopful of the confluent growth is similarly suspended in saline. Compare the tube with the turbidity standard and adjust the density of the test suspe nsion to that of the standard by adding more bacteria or more sterile saline. Proper adjustment of the turbidity of the inoculum is essential to ensure that the resulting lawn of growth is confluent or almost confluent. Inoculate the plates by dipping a s terile swab into the inoculum. Remove excess inoculum by pressing and rotating the swab firmly against the side of the tube above the level of the liquid. Streak the swab all over the surface of the medium three times, rotating the plate through an angle of 60 \u00baC after each application. Finally, pass the swab round the edge of the agar surface. Leave the inoculum to dry for a few minutes at room temperature with the lid closed. Standardizing t he inoculum 60 The antibiotic discs may be placed on the inoculated plates using a pair of st erile forceps. It is convenient to use a template to place the discs uniformly. A sterile needle tip may also be used to place the antibiotic discs on the plate. Alternatively, an antibiotic disc dispenser can be used to apply the discs to the inoculated plate. A maximum of seven discs can be placed on a 9 -10 cm plate. Six discs may be spaced evenly, approximately 15 mm from the edge of the plate, and one disc placed in the centre of the plate. Each disc should be gently pressed down to ensure even contact with the medium. Once discs have touched the medium, do not relocate them . The plates should be placed in an incubator at 35 C within 30 minutes of pre paration. Temperatures above 35 C invalidate results for oxacillin/met hicillin. Do not incubate in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide. After overnight incubation, the diameter of each zone (including the diameter of the disc) should be measured and recorded in mm. The results should then be interpreted according to the critical diameters. The measurements can be made with a ruler on the under -surface of the plate without opening the lid. If the medium is opaque, the zone can be measured by means of a pair of calipers. A template may be used to assess the final result of the susceptibility tests.

Relatively resistant strains may then be reported as susceptible. Conversely, if the inoculum is too heavy, the zone size will be reduced and susceptib le strains may be reported as resistant. Usually optimum results are obtained with an inoculum size that produces near confluent growth. Timing of disc application If the plates, after being seeded with the test strain, are left at room temperature for p eriods longer than the standard time, multiplication of the inoculum may take place before the discs are applied. This causes a reduction in the zone diameter and may result in a susceptible strain being reported as resistant. Temperature and time of inc ubation Susceptibility tests are normally incubated at 35 C for optimal growth. If the temperature is lowered, the time required for effective growth is extended and larger zones result. At higher temperature the entire culture appears to be susceptible. Mostly an incubation period of between 16 to 18 hours is adopted (overnight incubation). Size of plate, depth of agar medium, and spacing of the antibiotic discs Susceptibility tests are usually carried out with 9 -10 cm plates and no more than 6 or 7 anti biotic discs on each plate. A very thin media may lead to formation of excessively large inhibition zones and vice versa. Minor changes in depth of agar layer have negligible effect. 62 Proper spacing of the discs is essential to avoid overlapping of inhibiti on zones or deformation near edge of the plates. Composition of the medium The medium influences the size of the zone by its effect on the rate of growth of the organism, the rate of diffusion of the antibiotic and the activity of the agent. 63 Chapter 7 BIOSAFETY MEASURES IN LABORATORY \"Laboratory bio -safety\" is the term used to describe the practices that are implemented to prevent unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins, or their accidental release. Bio -safety protection is to protect laboratory workers, clinical samples and the environment. As no laboratory has complete control over the specimens it receives, standard precautions should always be adopted and practiced. Entry / access to laboratory area Entry to laboratory working area should be restricted only for authorized persons. Doors of the laboratory should be kept closed. Children should not be allowed to enter laboratory working areas. Laboratory Design and Facilities Enough space should be available Smooth easily cleanable walls, ceil ing and floors impermeable to liquids and resistant to chemicals and disi nfectants, should be preferred Bench tops should be impervious to water and resistant to disinfectants Ample illumination should be avail able for laboratory procedures Storage space m ust be adequate to hold supplies for immediate use and to preve nt overcrowding on bench tops Regular, water sup ply should be available Wash basins with running water, if possible, should be provided in the laboratory room, preferably near the exit door Suitably equipped first aid box should be available in the laboratory Rodents and insects control procedure in th e laboratory should be in place Standard precautions These combine the major features of Universal Precautions and Body Substance Isolation and a re based on the principle that all blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions except sweat, non -intact skin, and mucous membranes may contain transmissible infectious agents. Standard Precautions include a group of infection prevention practices that app ly to all patients, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status, in any setting in which healthcare is delivered. 64 These include: hand hygiene; use of gloves, gown, mask, eye protection, or face shield, depending on the anticipated exposure; and safe injection practices. Also, equipment or items in the patient environment likely to have been contaminated with infectious body fluids must be handled in a manner to prevent transmission of infectious agents (e.g., wear gloves for direct contact, cont ain heavily soiled equipment, properly clean and disinfect or sterilize reusable equipment before use on another patient). The application of Standard Precautions during patient care is determined by the nature of the HCW -patient interaction and the exte nt of anticipated blood, body fluid, or pathogen exposure. For some interactions (e.g., performing venepuncture ), only gloves may be needed; during other interactions (e.g., intubation), use of gloves, gown, and face shield or mask and goggles is necessary . Standard Precautions are also intended to protect patients by ensuring that healthcare personnel do not carry infectious agents to patients on their hands or via equipment used during patient care. Some of the important components of standard precauti ons are as under : Personal Protective Equipment 1. Gloves can reduce the incidents of contamination of hands but can not prevent penetrating injuries by needles and other sharp instruments. Gloves should be : Well fitting , disposable, vinyl Heavy duty general purpose rubber gloves for washing infected glassware/sharps Uses of Gloves Worn while collecting/handling blood specimens, blood soiled items or whenever there is a possibility of exposure to blood or body fluids containing blood Worn while disposing labo ratory waste When to change gloves The utility gloves may be decontaminated and reused but should be discarded if they are peeling, cracked, discolo ured, or if they have puncture, tears , etc Should be removed before handling door knobs, telephones, pens, p erforming office work and leaving the laboratory Must be changed if visibly contaminated with blood/breached 2. Laboratory gowns Use Gloves 65 Laboratory gowns or uniforms (preferably wrap -around gowns) should be worn when in the laboratory and s hould be removed before le aving Plastic aprons should be used while cleaning infected re -usable and during disposing wastes 3. Facial protection Simple and cheap deflector masks and protective glasses may be worn if splashing or spraying o f blood/body fluids is expected 4. Occlusive ba ndage All skin defects e.g. Cuts, scratches or other breaks must be covered with water -proof dressing befor e handling infectious materials Hand washing Hand washing is the single most important means of preventing the spread of infection. Hands should be washed between patient contacts and after contact with blood/ body fluids, secretions, excretions and equipment s or articles contaminated by these. The role of hands in the transmission of infections has been well demonstrated, and can be minimized with appropriate hand hygiene. Hands should be washed thoroughly in running water with soap without missing any area Washing of hands is mandatory after Contamination with blood / body fluids After removing gowns / coats and gloves 66 Before eating / drinking an d leaving the laboratory The fo llowing facilities are required : Running water: large washbasins preferably with hands free controls, which require little maintenan ce and with anti -splash devices Products: dry soap or liquid antiseptic depending on the proc edure. - Ideally, liquid soap dispensers should be provided to the laboratories, which should be regularly cleaned and maintained. If not feasible, soap bars after washing should be left in a dry tray to prevent contamination with some microorganisms which grow in moist conditions Suitable material for drying of hands; disposable towel s, reusable sterile single use t owels or roller towels which are suitably maintained Gloves should not be regarded as substitute for hand washing Safe techniques Steps for good hand washing 67 All proced ures and manipulations of potentially infectious material should be performed in a separate area, to minimize the formation of droplets , aerosols, splashes or spills Mouth pipetting should be strictly prohibited. Mechanical pipetting devices should be used for pipetting of all l iquids in the laboratory. Centrifugation should be done in tubes with safety caps Safe handling of sharps Extreme care should be used to avoid auto -inoculation. All chipped or cracked glassware should be discarded in appropriate co ntainers. Broken glass should be picked up with a brush and pan. Hands must never be used. The disposable needles should never be manipulated, bent, broken, recapped or removed from the syringes. The used sharps should never be passed directly from one per son to another . Each health care worker should dispose of his / her own sharps. Used needles should be discarded in puncture -proof rigid containers (plastic or cardboard boxes) after disinfection in 0.5 -1% freshly prepared sodium hypochlorite solution (comm on bleach) only. Do not mix with other waste. If a needle shredder is available, only the needles or the needles along with syringe nozzle may be shredded depending upon the type of the shredder Sharp disposable containers should be located close to the po int of use. Sharp disposal containers should b e sent for disposal when three - fourth s full. Precautions for s afe h andling of sharps Do's Don'ts Pass syringes and needles in a tray. Preferably cut it with needle cutter Never pass syringes and needle direct ly to next person Put needle and syringes in 2% hypochlorite solution if needle cutter is not available Do not bend or break or recap used needle with hands Pipetting To pick broken glass , use brush & pan or pieces of cardboard Needle shredder 68 Remove cap of needle near the site of use Never test the fineness of the needle's tip before use with bare or gloved hand Pick up open needle from tray/drum with forceps Never pick up open needle by hand Destroy syringes by burning their tips/or if cutters not available Never dispose it off by breaking it with hammer/stone Safe handling of spec imens Specimens, specially blood and body fluids should be collected in pre-sterilized screwcapped containers properly sealed to prevent spillage or leakage. Pre-sterilized /autoclaved / disposable syringes and needles for venepuncture or lancets / cutting needles for finger prick should be used. Auto destructive syringes if available are a good alternative. Cuts in hands should be properly covered with waterproof adhesive bandages. Disposable gloves should be worn while collecting blood / body fluids and p roper asepsis should be maintained. If a sample shows evidence of breakage (in case not collected in the above container), leakage or soiling, it should be transferred with a gloved hand into a second sterile container. Any important information should be rewritten from the old to the new container. This should only be done if sample is highly precious otherwise it should be discarded and fresh sample to be collected. Do not keep samples on requisition forms. If the requisition slip is contaminated with blo od, it should be rejected. In case of emergency, the contaminated slip may be handled using gloves. Hands should be thoroughly washed with soap and water before and after handling specimens. Specimen containers Specimen containers may be of glass or pref erably plastic. They should be robust and should not leak when the cap or stopper is correctly applied. A specimen container without cap/stopper is simply unacceptable for Sample collection. No material should remain on the outside of the container. Containers should be correctly labe lled to facilitate identification. Do not put samples on request forms. Specimen request or specification forms should not be wrapped around the containers but placed in separate, preferably 69 waterproof envelopes, whenever the specimen needs to be transported. Transport of specimens within the facility To avoid accidental leakage or spillage, secondary containers, such as boxes, should be used, fitted with racks so that the specimen containers remain upright. The secondary containers may be of metal or plastic, should be autoclavable or resistant to the action of chemical disinfectants, and the seal should preferably have a gasket. They should be regularly decontaminated Separation of serum : Always take care of following: PPE for h ands, eye and mucous membrane protection should be used (Standard precaution s) Splashes and aerosols can only be avoided or minimized by good laboratory techniques Blood and serum should be pipetted carefully, not poured Mouth -pipett ing is forbi dden After use, pipettes should be completely submerged in suitable disinfectant - they should remain in the disinfectant for the appropriate time before disposal or washing and sterilization for reuse (15 min utes). Discarded specimen tubes containing blo od clots, etc. (with caps replaced) should be placed in suitable leak -proof containers for au toclaving and/ or incineration Suitable disinfectants should be available for clean - up of splashes and spillages Safe handling of blood / body fluid spills In case of a spill of blood / body fluid in the laboratory, the area should be flood ed with a disinfectant solution e.g. freshly prepared 0.5 -1% sodium hypochlorite solution and left for 10 minutes. After wearing gloves, the area should be covered with paper t owels or gauze sponges to absorb the liquid followed by a thorough wash with soap and water. All contaminated materials should be disposed of as Procedure to clean up spills Pour 1% freshly prepared sodium hypochlorite solution over spills in sufficient quantity Cover the spill with paper towel or absorbent material Leave for 10 minutes before cleaning it Wipe up the whole spill with fresh absorbent material using gloved hands and discard in a contaminated waste contain er Wipe the surface with soap and water Record the event 70 infectious waste. Laundry and linen Although soiled linen has been identified as a source of large numbers o f certain pathogenic organisms, the risk of actual disease transmission i s negligible Soiled linen may be handled as little as possible and with minimum agitation to prevent gross microbial contamination of the air an d of persons handling the linen All soi led linen must be handled with gloved hands and if feasible, decontaminated in 0.5 - 1% sodium hypochlorite in the laborator y before sending to the laundry Soiled linen after decontamination should be put in heavy plastic bags which a re tied and sent to the laundry In the laundry, decontamination in bleach is recommended in case not done earlier. This should be followed by washing in hot water (>70 \u00b0C) with detergent General biosafety rules for laboratory workers Eating, drinking, smoking and application of cosmetics are prohibited in the laboratory. Laboratory should be kept neat, clean and free of materi als not pertinent to the work. Sandals and open shoes do not afford proper foot protection and should be avoided . As far as possible contact lenses should not be worn , instead wear spectacles. Laboratory and work tables should be scrupulously cleaned with liquid detergents and disinfectants. Laboratory work surface should be decontaminated twice daily, once before beginning work and once after completion o f day's activity. It should also be cleaned immediately after spill of viable material with disinfectant. Centrifuge safety caps should be used whenever handling hazardous specimens and when it is likely to produce aerosols or infectious droplets. Blood a nd other specimen containers should be labe lled with a warning sign. The outside of the specimen container should be cleaned with sodium hypochlorite solution in case of visible contamination. Gloves should be worn while dealing with blood specimens, blood - soiled items, body fluids, excretions, secretions, surface materials and objects exposed to them. Hands should be washed immediately after contact with blood and before leaving the laboratory. 71 Hands should always be washed before wearing and after removin g gloves. Gowns / laboratory coats must be worn while working with potentially infective materials and removed before leaving the laboratory. Recapping or bending of needles is strictly prohibited. Needles should be destroyed with needle destroyer and rema ining hub should be put in puncture proof container. Syringes should be put in freshly prepared 1% sodium hypochlorite solution. Paper work should not be done on potentially contaminated surface. All potentially contaminated materials and wastes from the laboratory should be disposed after decontamination preferably by autoclaving / incineration. Biosafety management Designate one person responsible for bio -safety activities, e.g. DMS / Microbiologist / MO CHC / PHC or senior laboratory technician. Appropr iate medical evaluation, surveillance and treatment should be provided for all personnel in case of need, and adequate medical records should be maintained. Immunization against diseases which are feasible must be given according to the schedule, especiall y against Hepatitis B , etc. Staff should receive regular training in laboratory bio -safety and should be updated at regular interval. A copy of the Bio -safety manual should be available in the laboratory at all times. Training Human error and poor techniq ues are important in non protection of laboratory workers. Continuous in -service training in safety measures is essential for health care workers to minimize human errors and improve laboratory techniques. An effective safety program begins with the labora tory in -charge, who should ensure that safe laboratory practices and procedures are being followed. Staff training should include safe methods adopted for commonly used laboratory procedures like: Inhalation risks - using loops, streaking agar plate, pipe tting, smear preparation, opening culture stocks, centrifugation, taking blood/serum samples etc. Ingestion risks - handling specimens, smears, cultures. Inoculation risks - accidental needle stick injuries. Handling blood and other infectious agents. Decontamination and disposal of infectious material. Health and medical check up 72 The microbiologist / pathologist at the d istrict public health laboratory could help in ensuring that there is regular health check up of laboratory personnel. The objective of such check up is to monitor for occupationally acquired diseases. Provision of immunization: It is recommended that all laboratory persons receive protective immunization against the disease they are dealing with especially Hepatitis B which plays a key ro le in prevention of transmission of HBV from patient to health care worker. Therefore it is important that all the HCW's including the laboratory workers should be immunized with 3 doses of hepatitis B as per approved schedule (0, 1 and 6 months interval) . Health care worker should receive booster dose after 5 -6 years interval. Regular health check -up of the staff for diseases including collection of samples where ever indicated. The record for the same should be maintained. Good Microbiological Techniques - Safe laboratory procedures Human error, poor laboratory techniques and misuse of equipment cause the majority of laboratory injuries and work -related infections. This chapter provides a short note on technical methods that are designed to avoid or minim ize the most commonly reported problems of this nature. Receipt of specimens Laboratories that receive large numbers of specimens should have a designated room or area for this purpose. It will be preferred to have computerized system for record maintenan ce. Opening packages Personnel who receive and unpack specimens should be aware of the potential health hazards involved, and should be trained to adopt standard precautions, particularly when dealing with broken or leaking containers. Primary specimen c ontainers should be opened in a biological safety cabinet. Disinfectants should be available. Use of centrifuges Satisfactory mechanical performance is a prerequisite of microbiological safety in the use of laboratory centrifuges. Centrifuges should be o perated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Centrifuges should be placed at such a level that workers can see into the bowl to place buckets correctly. Tubes and specimen containers should always be securely capped (screw -capped if possible) fo r centrifugation. 73 Buckets and trunnions should be paired by weight and, with tubes in place, correctly balanced. The amount of space that should be left between the level of the fluid and the rim of the centrifuge tube should be given in manufacturer's i nstructions to be followed. Distilled water or alcohol 70% should be used for balancing empty buckets. Saline or hypochlorite solutions should not be used as they corrode metals. The interior of the centrifuge bowl should be inspected daily for staining or soiling at the level of the rotor. If staining or soiling is evident then the centrifugation protocols should be re -evaluated. Centrifuge rotors and buckets should be inspected daily for signs of corrosion and for hair - line cracks. Buckets, rotors an d centrifuge bowls should be decontaminated after each use. After use, buckets should be stored in an inverted position to drain the balancing fluid. Infectious airborne particles may be ejected when centrifuges are used. These particles travel at speeds too high to be retained by the cabinet airflow if the centrifuge is placed in a traditional open - fronted Class I or Class II biological safety cabinet. However, good centrifuge technique and securely capped tubes offer adequate protection against infectio us aerosols and dispersed particles. Glass and \"sharps\" Plastics should replace glass wherever possible. Only laboratory grade (borosilicate) glass should be used, and any article that is chipped or cracked should be discarded. Hypodermic needles must not be used as pipettes Before discarding disposable syringes/needles, mutilate/ disfigure to avoid reuse or picking up by rag pickers for recirculation. Films and smears for microscopy Fixing and staining of blood, sputum and faecal samples for microscopy do not necessarily kill all organisms or viruses on the smears. These items should be handled with forceps, stored appropriately, and decontaminated and/or autoclaved before disposal. 74 Chapter 8 BIOMEDICAL WASTE MANA GEMENT Bio-medical waste is defined as waste that is generated during the diagnosis, treatment or immunization of human beings and are contaminated with patients' body fluids (such as syringes, needles, ampoules, organs and body parts, placenta, dressings, disposables plastics and microbiologi cal waste ). Laboratory waste is a potential reservoir of pathogenic microorganisms and requires appropriate handling. It is the duty of every one in an institute generating Bio - Medical Waste to take all the steps to ensure that such waste is handled with out any adverse effect to human health and environment. All pathology, microbiology laboratories and blood banks are governed by the regulations of biomedical waste (BMW) management rules, 1998. Safe disposal of laboratory waste Laboratory wastes are pote ntial hazards. Infectious waste can transmit numerous diseases in the community. Also, those who handle waste are at risk. The increasing use of disposables in health care is also posing an additional burden on the waste management facility. Recycling of t hese items should be prevented. A small percentage of the waste generated in health care settings is infectious while some of it is non -infectious but hazardous. The most practical approach to the management of biomedical waste is to identify and segregate infectious waste at the point of generation prior to its storage, transportation & disposal. This will drastically reduce the cost of the disposal methods in health care settings. Principles / concept of waste management Segregation of wastes into the pr escribed categories must be done at the source i.e. at the point of generation. Hospital/ laboratory waste requires management at every step from generation, segregation, collection, transportation, storage, and treatment to final disposal. Colo ur coded ba gs as per national norms need to be placed in appropriate containers with the appropriate label / logo e.g. biohazard symbol for infectious waste. Puncture proof containers made of plastic or metal with a biohazard symbol, in blood collection areas, should be made available for collecting sharp metallic waste . 75 Collection systems for the transport of segregated wastes need to be provided for transportation of waste to the site of incinerator. A storage area for wastes which already has been disinfected pri or to incineration needs to be demarcated. Table 8.1 - Ten c ategories of biomedical waste (schedule I of BMW rules 1998 ) Option Waste Category Treatment and Disposal Category 1 Human Anatomical wastes (Human tissues, organs, body parts) Incineration @ / deep burial * Categor y 2 Animal waste (animal tissues, organs, body parts carcasses, bleeding parts, fluid , blood and experimental animals used in research, waste generated by veterinary hospitals, colleges, discharges from hospital , animal houses) Incineration @ / deep burial * Category 3 Microbiology & Biotechnology Waste (Wastes from lab.

It must be ensured that chemical treatment ensures disinfection. ## Mutilation / shredding must be such as to prevent unauthorized reuse. @ There will be no chemical pretreatment before incineration. Chlorinated plastics shall not be incinerated. * Deep burial shall be an option available only in towns with population less than five lakhs and in rural areas 77 Steps for w aste management Waste segregation Biomedical waste should be segregated at the point of generation. It consists of placing different types of waste in different containers or colo ur-coded -bags. This helps in reducing the bulk of infectious was te and contains spread of infection to general waste. This practice reduces the total treatment cost, the impact of waste in the community and the risk of infecting workers. Table 8.2 - Collection / disposal of biomedical waste Colour Type of Container Waste Category Treatment options Yellow Plastic Bag Categories 1, 2, 3 & 6 Incineration deep burial Red Plastic Bag Categories 3, 6, 7 Autoclaving/Micro - waving Chemical Treatment Blue/White Translucent Plastic Bag/ puncture proof containers Categories 4 , 7 Autoclaving/Micro - waving/ Chemical Treatment & Destruction / shredding Black Plastic Bag Categories 5, 9, 10 Disposal in secured landfill Collection bags Waste collection bags for waste types needing incineration shall not be made of chlorinated pla stics. Categories 8 and 10 (liquid) do not require containers/bags. Category 3, if disinfected locally need not be put in containers/bags Solid wastes are collected in leak -resistant heavy duty bags. Bags should have labels mentioning date and details o f waste. The bags to be tied tightly after they are three - fourth full. Storage and transport Segregati on Collection and Storage Transportatio Treatment and disposal 78 All containers used for storage of biomedical waste should be provided with a properly covered lid. Such containers should be inaccessible to scavengers and pro tected against insects, birds, animals and rain. If a container is transported from the premises where Biomedical Waste is generated to any waste treatment facility outside the premises, the container should have a label and the information regarding waste category, sender's name and address. Also the name & address of the person to be contacted in case of emergency should be mentioned on the container. Label should be non washable and prominently visible. There should not be any spillage during handling an d transit of biomedical waste. Untreated Biomedical waste should be transported in vehicles authorized for this purpose by the competent authority as specified by the government. Untreated Biomedical Waste should not be kept stored beyond a period of 48 h ours. If for any reason it becomes necessary to store the waste beyond such period, the authorized person must take permission of the prescribed authority and take measures to ensure that the waste does not adversely affect human health and environment. Treatment & disposal All biomedical wastes should be treated and disposed of strictly in accordance with the guidelines issued by Ministry of Environment and Forest (Notification dated 20 July 1998 ). Waste which cannot be incinerated (plastics), should be p re- treated by disinfection and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. Waste should not be dumped, discharged or disposed in any place other than a site identified for the purpose. All treatment and disposal facilities should be located at a spec ified area away from the general service area of the hospital, public places and residential areas. When the treatment option is burial, the pits should be located at sites away from agricultural land, residential areas, ground -and safe water sources. The re should be no leakage from the pits into surrounding areas. All plastics should be disinfected, shredded and disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner. Recycling of disposables e.g. syringes, needles, gloves, etc. should be prevented. All liq uid waste should be disinfected and flushed in the sinks at the point of generation. Biomedical waste should not be disposed off on open land and municipal dustbins. 79 Untreated liquid waste should not be let off into sewers. All precautions and personal safety measures should be taken (including provision of protective clothing, masks, gloves, gumboots, goggles, etc ). Maintenance of Records Every authorized person should maintain records related to the generation, collection, reception, storage transpor tation, treatment, disposal and or any form of handling of biomedical waste in accordance with the rules. All records shall be subject to inspection and verification by the prescribed authority at any time. Reporting of accidents In the event of an accide nt occurring at any location or site where biomedical waste is handled or during transportation, the appropriate authorities must be informed and needful action taken. 80 Chapter 9 QUALITY ASSURANCE Quality assurance programmes are an efficient way of mainta ining the standards of performance of diagnostic laboratories throughout the world, and of upgrading these standards where necessary. The quality of a microbiological laboratory test not just includes reliability (accuracy) and its reproducibility (precisi on) but also the speed (test should be rapid enough to be used by the doctor for the treatment), the cost (cost of the test reasonable in relation to the benefit to the patient) and the clinical relevance of the test (test must help in prevention of treatm ent of the disease). Factors that affect reliability and reproducibility of t he laboratory results Personnel : The performance of laboratory worker or technician is directly related to quality of education and training received, the person's experience a nd the conditions of employment. Environmental factors : Inadequate working space, lighting or ventilation, extreme temperatures, excessive noise levels or unsafe working conditions may affect results Specimens : The method and time of sampling and the sour ce of the specimen are often outside the direct control of the laboratory, but have a direct bearing on the ability of the laboratory to achieve reliable results. Other factors that the laboratory can control and that affect quality are transport, identifi cation, storage and processing of specimens. The laboratory therefore has a role in educating those taking and transporting specimens. Written instructions should be made available and regularly reviewed. Laboratory materials : The quality of reagents, chem icals, glassware, stains and culture media all influence the reliability of test results. Equipment : Lack of equipment or the use of substandard or poorly maintained instruments will give unreadable results. Examination and reading : Hurried reading of resu lts, or failure to examine a sufficient number of microscope fields can cause errors. Reporting : Transcription errors or incomplete reports, cause problems. Quality Assurance in microbiology Quality assurance is the sum of all those activities in which th e laboratory is engaged to ensure that test results are of good quality. There are two types of quality assurance: Internal : this is called Quality Control. This means that each laboratory has a programme to check the quality of its own tests. 81 Internal qua lity control is absolutely necessary for good operating procedure and involves, ideally: Continuous monitoring of test quality Comprehensive checking of all steps from collection of specimen (wherever possible) to issue of report. External : this is called Quality Assessment. This means that the laboratory performance is controlled by an external agency. External quality assessment involves: Periodic monitoring of test quality Spot checking of identification tests, & sometimes of isolation techniques. INTERNAL QUALITY CONTROL Laboratory operations manual Each laboratory should have an operations manual, covering the following subjects: Biosafety manual which must include instructions for cleaning the workplace, personal hygiene, safety precautions, handling and disposal of infected material. Care of equipment Guidelines for collection, transport, storage, registration (including rejection criteria), processing, analysis and reporting of specimens. Monitoring laboratory equipment and reagents Care of e quipment A preventive maintenance program to ensure proper functioning of all electrical and mechanical equipment should be established in all microbiology laboratories. Equipment should be checked at prescribed time intervals; certain working parts should be re placed after a specified period of use. Assignments should be made among laboratory personnel to ensure that all inspections are carried out and all data are recorded accurately onto charts or in maintenance manuals. It is important to detect upward or downward trends immediately, so appropriate corrective action can be taken before serious errors result. Table 9.1 - Quality control procedures of commonly used microbiology equipment for optimal functioning Equipment Procedure Schedule Tolerance Limit s Technical maintenance Refrigerators Freezers Recording of temperature* Daily or continuous 2 to 8C -8 to -20C -60 to -75C Every 6 months Incubators Recording of temperature* Daily or continuous 36 +1C Every 6 months 82 Water baths Recording of tempe rature* Daily or twice daily 36 - 38C 55 - 57C Every 6 months Autoclaves Check & adjust water level Record time & temperature or pressure Test with spore strip Before each run For each run At least weekly No growth of spores in subculture Every 6 mont hs Hot air oven Record time and temperature* For each run + 1C of setting Every 6 months *Format for recording of equipment operating temperature appended in the annexure Culture Media Culture media may be prepared in the laboratory from dehydrated pow ders available commercially or may be purchased ready for use. For best results, careful attention is required to the points given below: Selection of media A good agar base can be used as an all purpose medium, for preparing blood agar, chocolate agar a nd other selective media. One one less selective medium are generally all that is required for isolation of Enterobacteriaceae or Vibrio cholera e from stool specimen. Ordering and storage of dehydrated media Order quantities that will be used in 6 mont hs or at the most 1 year . Overall quantity should be packed up in containers that will be used up in 1 -2 months . On receipt tighten cap of all contain ers securely. Dehydrated media absorb water from the atmosphere. In a humid climate, seal the tops of containers of dehydrated media with parafilm/foil etc. Write date of receipt of each container . Store in a dark, cool, well ventilated place. Rotate the stock so that older materials are used first. Whe n a container is opened, write the date of opening on it. Discard all dehydrated media that are either caked or hardened. Keep written records of media in stock . Preparation of media Follow strictly the man ufacturers instructions Prepare a quantity that will be used up before the shelf life expires Storage of prepared media Protect against sunlight 83 Protect against heat. Media containing blood, other organic additives or antibiotics should be stored in the refrigerator. The shelf life of prepared media, when stored in a cool, dark place, will depend on the type of container used. Typical shelf lives are: Tubes with cotton plugs - 3 weeks Tubes with loose caps - 2 weeks Petri dishes, if sealed in plastic bags - 4 weeks Quality control of prepared media Sterility testing : Carry out routine sterility tests on media to which blood or other components have been added after autoclaving. Take 3 -5% of each batch and incubate at 3 7C for 2 days. Refrigerate the rest. If more than 2 colonies per plate seen discard the whole batch. Prepared media should also be observed for other signs of deterioration, such as discoloration, turbidity, colour changes, evidence of freeze/thawing and status of dehydration. Performance t esting : The laboratory should keep a set of stock strains for monitoring the performance of media. These strains can be obtained through routine work or from commercial official sources . Each new batch of media should be checked for reactivity and for appr opriate support of microbial growth. Table 9.2 - Quality control of c ommonly used media Medium Control Organisms Incubation Expected Reactions Blood agar Staphylococcus aureus 24 hrs, CO 2 Growth and beta haemolysis TCBS Vibrio sp (non agglutinable) 24 hrs Yellow colonies MacConkey agar E coli P mirabilis 24 hrs Red colonies Pale colonies (no swarming) Deoxycholate citrate agar E coli S typhimurium/ aeruginosa ATCC 27853 24 hrs Acceptable zone sizes Stains and reagents Testing should be carried out each time a new batch of working solution is prepared , and control smears should be stained. Control smear for Gram stain should include a smear with a mixture of Gram positive cocci & Gram negative bacilli . Control smear for Gram stain can be prepared from mixed culture of staphylococci and Escherichia coli. Stains and reagents should be discarded when: 84 The manufa cturer's expiry date is reached. Visible signs of deterioration appear (turbidity, precipitate, discoloration). Diagnostic antigens and antisera In order to obtain the best results from antigens and antisera , always follow the manufacturer's instructions. Store at the recommended temperature. Some serological reagents do not tolerate freezing. Avoid repeated freezing and thawing. Before freezing, divide antiserum into aliquots sufficient for a few tests. Discard when the manufacturer 's expiry date is reac hed. To test agglutinating antisera, always use pure, fresh known cultures. Always include a serum control of known reactivity in each batch of tests. The serum may be from patient or from a commercial source. Paired sera from the same patient, taken durin g acute and convalescent phases of the disease, should be tested with the same batch of reagents. Each batch of serological test should include: - A negative serum (specificity control) - A weakly reactive serum (sensitivity control) - A strongly reactive serum (titration control), which should read within one dilution of its titre when last tested Always record all control serum titres Antimicrobial susceptibility testing The final result of a disc diffusion test is influenced by a large number of variables. Some of the factors, such as the inoculum density and the incubation temperature, are easy to control, but a laboratory rarely knows the exact composition of a commercial medium or the batch - to-batch variations in its quality, and it cannot take for grante d the antimicrobial content of the discs. The results of the test must therefore be monitored constantly by a quality control programme, which should be considered part of the procedure itself. The precision and accuracy of the test are controlled by the parallel use of a set of control strains, with known susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents. These quality control strains are tested using exactly the same procedure as for the test organisms. The zone sizes shown by the control organisms should fall within the range of diameters given in Table 9.3. When results regularly fall outside this range, they should be regarded as evidence that a technical error has been introduced into the test, or that the reagents are at fault. Each reagent and each step in the test should then be investigated until the cause of the error has been found and eliminated. 85 The routine use of modified Kirby Bauer method is recommended. To avoid errors, the following guidelines should be used: Discs should be of correct diameter and correct potency The stock supply should be stored frozen ( -20C) The working supply should be kept no longer than one month in a refrigerator (2 -8C) Only Mueller Hinton agar whose performance has been tested should be used. The inoculum should be sta ndardized against the prescribed turbidity standard Zone sizes should be measured exactly and should be compared to a table of critical diameters. Zone diameters for each of the test organism should fall within the control limits. Only pure cultures of ra pidly growing bacteria give reliable readings. The three standard control strains are : o E. coli ATCC 25922, NCTC 6571 Tests should be carried out with the three standard strains when: o A new batch of discs is put to use o A new batch of medium is put to use o Once a week, in parallel with the routine antibiograms Reading the plates After 16 to 18 hours incubation, the diameters of the inhibition zones should be measured with a ruler and recor ded, together with the date of the test, on a special quality control chart. This chart should display data for each disc -strain combination. The chart is labelled in millimetres, with an indication of the range of acceptable zone sizes. When the results c onsistently fall outside the acceptable limits, action should be taken to improve the quality of the test. Table 9.3 - Zone inhibition diameter limits for control strains Diameter of zone of inhibition (mm) Antibiotic Disc potency S. aureus 24-32 - 30 g 19-28 18-25 - Grossly aberrant results, which cannot be explained by technical errors in the procedure, may indicate contamination or sudden changes in the susceptibility or growth characteristic of the control stra in. If this occurs, a fresh stock -strain should be obtained from a reliable source. Maintenance and use of stock cultures Stock strains can be obtained from a combination of sources: Official culture collections like ATCC etc. Reference laboratories Prope rly documented isolates from clinical specimens (select strains so that the maximum number of morphological, metabolic and serological characters can be tested with the minimum number of cultures. They are commercially available in the form of pellets of desiccated pure cultures. Cultures for day -to-day use should be grown on slants of nutrient agar (tryptic soy agar is convenient) and stored in the refrigerator. They should be subcultured on to fresh slants every 2 weeks. Preservation Long term preservat ion Long term preservation methods permit intervals of months or even years between subcultures. The best methods for preservation are lyophilization (freeze drying) or storage at -70C or below, in an electric freezer of liquid nitrogen. Alternative meth ods include : 1. Glycerol at -20C Grow a pure culture on an appropriate solid medium When the culture is fully developed, scrape it off with a loop. Suspend small clumps of the culture in sterile neutral glycerol Distribute in quantities of 1 -2 ml in screw ca pped tubes or vials. Store at -20C Avoid repeated freezing and thawing Transfer after 12 -18 months 2. Mineral oil at room temperature 87 Prepare tubes of heart infusion agar with a short slant Sterilize mineral oil in hot air oven (170 C for 1 hour) Grow a pu re culture on the agar slant When good growth is seen, add sterile mineral oil to about 1 cm above the tip of the slant Subculture when needed by scraping growth from under the oil. Store at room temperature. Transfer after 6 -12 months 3. Stab cultures at roo m temperature (use for non fastidious organisms like Staphylococcus and Enterobacteriaceae only) Prepare tubes with a deep butt of carbohydrate free agar. Tryptic soy agar (soybean casein digest agar) is recommended. Stab the organism into the agar at seve ral places. Incubate overnight at 37C Close tube with screw cap. Dip cap with molten paraffin wax to seal. Store at room temperature. Transfer after 1 year. Short term preservation Working cultures for daily routine tests (for rapid growing organisms) can be prepared in the following ways: Inoculate on tryptic soy agar slants in screw capped tubes Incubate overnight at 37C Store in refrigerator Transfer every 2 weeks Use of reference laboratory Submit the following cultures to a regional or central reference laboratory: Specimens for infrequently requested or highly specia lised tests (e.g. virology etc) Specimens needing further confirmation, specification, grouping, or typing of pathogens of great public health importance e.g. Salmonella, Shigella, V ibrio cholera e, etc. 88 EXTERNAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT (PROFICIENCY TESTING ) The purposes of a quality assessment programme are: To provide assurance to both physicians and the general public that laboratory diagnosis is of good quality. To assess and compar e the reliability of laboratory performance on a national scale. To identify common errors. To encourage the use of uniform procedures. To encourage the use of standard reagents. To take administrative measures ( which may include revocation of the operatin g licence) against substandard laboratories. To stimulate the implementation of internal quality control programmes. Organization A quality assessment programme consists of a number of surveys in which coded specimens are distributed by mail to participa ting laboratories. These specimens should be incorporated into the laboratory routine, and handled and tested in exactly the same way as routine clinical specimens. The surveys should be conducted in accordance with the following recommendations: Surveys should be carried out 12 times per year ideally, but at least 4 times per year. A minimum of 3 specimens should be included in each survey. The reporting period should be short, for example 1 week following receipt of specimen. Instructions and report form s should be included with each survey. The report sheet should be in duplicate, with a clearly stated deadline. Cultures Cultures could be included for identification and for susceptibility testing against a limited range of antibiotics; they may be pure cultures or mixtures of two or more cultures. Cultures could represent the following categories: 1. Bacterial species that are of great public health potential, but which are not often seen in routine practice, for example Salmonella paratyphi A, Salm onella typhi, Vibrio cholerae Shigella, E. coli , and Klebsiella may be used to test the skill of a laboratory in isolating pathogenic microorganisms from a number of commensal organisms. 89 3. A mixture of nonpathogenic organisms may be used to tes t for ability to recognize negative specimens. Sera Serological tests for the following infections c ould be part of an external quality assessment programme: Leptospira Dengue Typhoid Syphilis Rubella Hepatitis Rating and reporting of results As soon as all reports are received from participating laboratories, the correct answers should be sent to the laboratories. Within one month after that, a final report should be sent to the laboratories with an analysis of the results. A performance score is given t o each laboratory. Each laboratory should have a code number known only to itself. Thus it can recognize its own performance in relation to others, but other laboratories remain anonymous. 90 Annexure 1 STATE REFERRAL LAB NETWORK - CONCEPT NOTE IDSP is aimed to improve the disease surveillance in the country and plans to strengthen the public health laboratories at different levels. However, the implementation experience has shown that the development of public health laboratories is not at the same level at different states. Most of the labs are performing clinical testing but they lack facilities for diagnosis of epidemic prone diseases. In most states the laboratories have been found to be lacking in manpower and adequate infrastructure and are also not i n a position for regularly performing the various tests as planned under the project. The current strategy planned is to develop 50 priority district labs in 35 states. To provide access to diagnostic facilities for epidemic prone diseases during outbreak situations to the remaining districts, state based referral lab network is being piloted in 9 states. States are to identify functional labs existing in the medical colleges and various other centres and link the adjoining districts t o them for providing the lab services.

The simplest way of examining a bacterial suspension for motile bacteria is as follows: Procedure Take a clean glass slide & make a thin ring of plasticine & apply it over the slide. Thickness of the ring should not be more than 1mm, so that there is no difficulty in focusing the slide with 40x high power objective. Take a clean cover slip & put on small drop of liquid culture over the cover slip with the help of a small sized inoculating loop (about 1mm diameter). Put the slide containing plasticine ring over the cover slip containing the drop of liquid culture without touching the drop and then invert the slide so that the drop hangs. Put the condenser low and f ocus the slide in low power (10 x objectives) and try to focus the edge of the drop. Make sure the iris diaphragm of the condenser is sufficiently closed to give good contrast otherwise the organ ism will not be seen. Examine next in high power i.e. 40 x objective for checking the motility against the stationary background. Interpretation 104 Motility of Vibrio cholerae is typically described as 'darting (shooting d arting motility is suggestive of Vibrio cholerae subject to confirmation of culture. Not finding darting motility does not rule out cholera. The keys to a good hanging drop slide are Use a small drop of bacterial suspension, but do not let it dry out, and Use a young culture of bacteria. Note: The movements of small motile bacteria must be distinguished from the on the spot vibratory movement (Brownian movements) which is shown by all microorganism and particles when suspended in a fluid. True bacteria l motility is the ability of an organism to move itself in different directions or a single direction. Gram Stain ing This is one of the most common staining procedures used for examining specimens suspected to contain bacteriologic agents. Direct micros copic examination of specimens and cultures can provide a rapid presumptive diagnosis. Gram staining can give information regarding the shape of cell, the type of cell arrangement (single chained, clustered) and gram reaction that can provide a quick asses sment of what the etiologic agent may be. Principle Certain bacteria when treated with one of the basic para rosaniline dyes such as Methyl Violet, Crystal Violet or Gentian Violet (which is a mixture of two preceding dyes) and then with Iodine, fix the s tain so that subsequent treatment with a decolourizing agent e.g. alcohol or acetone does not remove the colour. Other organisms however, are decolourized by this process. Thus, if a mixture of various organisms are stained and subjected to decolourizing a gents, it is found that some retain the dye, and these are termed Gram -Positive whereas others are completely decolourized and are termed as Gram -Negative. In order to render the decolourized organism visible, and to distinguish them from those retaining the colour, a counter stain is then applied. This counter stain is usually red so that the gram -negative organism which appears reddish pink in colour may easily be differentiated from gram -positive organism, which retains the original violet stain. 105 Specimens Smear prepared from any of the following e.g. throat swab, nasal swab, ear discharge, pleural fluid, CS F, uretheral discharge, sputum, centrifuged deposit of urine, bacterial culture, vaginal discharge etc. can be stained by this method. Materials Crystal violet (0.5%) o Crystal violet - 0.5 gm o Distilled water - 100 ml Gram's iodine (1%) o Iodine crystals - 1gm o Potassium iodide - 2 gm o Distilled water - 100 ml Acetone (100%) or Ethanol (95%) Safranine (0.5%) o Safranine -0.5gm o Ethyl Alcohol - 10 ml o Distilled water -make up volume to 100 ml Distilled water Procedure Appropriate smear is made on a clean glass slide. The smear is fixed by passing the slide over flame 2 -3 times quickly. Cover the slide with crystal violet solution and allow to act for about 30 seconds. Pour off stain and holding the slide at an angle downwards pour on the iodine solution on the slide so that it washes away the crystal violet. Cover the slide with fresh iodine solution and allow to act for 1 minute. Wash off the iodine with ethanol and treat with fresh alcohol, tilt the slide from side to side until colour ceases to come out of the preparation. This is easily seen by holding the slide against a white background . Alternatively, decolorize with 100% acetone. First tip off the iodine and hold the slide at a steep slope. Then pour acetone over the slide from its upper end, so as to cover its whole surface. De -colorization is very rapid and is usually complete in 2 -3 seconds. After this period of contact, wash thorough ly with water under a running tap Apply the counter -stain (0.5% safranine) for 30 seconds. Wash with water and blot dry. Examine the smear under oil immersion microscopy. Result o Violet stained bacteria - Gram -Positive o Reddish pink bacteria - Gram -Negative Quality Control Use clean, grease -free slides for making smears. Prepare smear 2 cm in diameter and not very thick. To avoid false positive results, ensure the cleanliness of the microscope especially the oil immersion (100X) objectives which come in c ontact 106 with smears To obviate errors from over decolorizing, a control smear of a known gram positive organism (.e.g. a pure culture of Staphylococcus aureus ) may be prepared on one end of slide and a smear of gram negative organism e.g. Escherichia coli be prepared on the other end of the slide. The smears thus prepared should be stained by the grams stain as described. The smear prepared from Staphylococcus aureus should show violet coloured bacteria whereas the one made from E. coli should show pink colo ured bacteria. Check the quality of stains by using appropriate positive and negative control slides at least once a week and whenever a fresh ba tch of stains is introduced on the work bench Preparation of Gram stained smear f rom CSF specimen Materials required Sterile glass slide, dropper, centrifuge, stains , sterile tube Procedure 1. Sufficient CSF, at least 1 -2 ml should be available for centrifugation. 2. Centrifuge in a clean sterile tube at high speed for 3 -5 min. 3. Take out th e tube carefully; remove the supernatant in a separate sterile tube for antigen detection tests. 4. Take the pellet deposit and use for both culture and smear preparation. 5. Put a drop of the deposit onto the centre of the slide and spread evenly onto a small a rea. Let it air dry. Gram positive cocci (in chains) Gram negative bacilli Gram negative cocci (in pairs) Gram positive bacilli 107 6. After the smear has dried, heat fix it. 7. Place the slide over the staining rack. Cover with crystal violet for 1 min. 8. Wash with water and pour iodine solution over it. Keep for 1 min. 9. Decolourize with acetone quickly, again wash with wa ter. 10. Counterstain with safranine for 1 min. Wash with water. 11. Blot dry and observe under oil immersion objective. Observation The meningococci appear as gram negative diplococci both inside and outside polymorphs. Heavily encapsulated strains have a distin ct pink halo around them. Often the organisms show considerable size variation and may resist decolourization. Report the number of organisms and the number of polymorphs as they have a prognostic value. Albert 's Staining Principle The diphtheria bacill i - Corynebacterium diphtheriae have well developed granules of volutin (polymetaphosphate) which are seen as round refractile bodies within the bacterial cytoplasm. With basic dyes, they tend to stain more strongly than the rest of the bacterium. With tol uidine blue / methylene blue they stain metachromatically a reddish purple colour. This is demonstrated most clearly by special methods such as Albert's or Neisser's. Diphtheria bacillus gives its characteristic volutin reactions best in a young culture (1 8-24hr) on blood or serum medium. Albert's staining contains Toluidine blue Malachite green 2.0g Glacial acetic acid 10 ml Alcohol(95% ethanol) 20 ml Distilled water 1000 ml Dissolve the dyes in alcohol and add to the wate r & acetic acid. Allow to stand for 1 day and then filter. Alternatively, use commercially prepared stain. Albert's iodine (Albert 's II) contains Iodine 6g Potassium iodide 9g Distilled water 900 ml Dissolve the KI in I2 and Procedure 1. Make smear, dry in air and heat fix. 2. Cover with Albert I and allow to act for 3 -5 minutes. 3. Wash with water and blot dry. 108 4. Cover with Albert's iodine for 1 min ute. Wash & blot dry. 5. Observe under 100 x (oil immersion) objective. 6. The bacilli appear green, granules stain blu ish black, and oth er organisms stain light green. The \"barred\" appearance is due to the presence of polyphosphate inclusions called metachromatic granules. Note also the characteristic \"Chinese -letter\" arrangement of cells. Albert -stained C. diphtheriae 109 Annexure 6 COMMON CULTURE MEDI A If pathogens are to be isolated successfully, standard operating procedures (SOPs) are needed for each culture medium used in the laboratory, its purpose, from where it can be obtained, its preparation and how it is sterilized, dispensed, label led, sto red and performance tested. In the preparation of complex culture media, it is advisable for district laboratories to use ready -made standardized dehydrated media to ensure good performance and reproducibility. Dehydrated media is hygroscopic, i.e. it ab sorbs water, when exposed to water it rapidly becomes unfit for use. Adequate precautions must be taken to pr event this, which include : 1. Weighing the medium rapidly and tightly capping the bottle as soon as possible after removing the approximate amount. Do not return small amounts of medium to the stock bottle. 2. Sealing the cap of the container with adhesive tape. 3. Storing media in the coolest driest place available and always out of sunlight, e.g. do not store dehydrated media in the same room as used for st eam sterilization, boiling materials, or cleaning glassware etc. Preparation of culture media The following are important while preparing culture media: Prepare media made from dehydrated products in as damp -free an environment as possible. To prevent the risk of inhaling fine particles of dehydrated media, wear a dust mask while handling dehydrated media. Wash hands immediately after preparing media. Once the ingredients are weighed, do not delay in making up the medium. Follow the manufacturer's inst ructions exactly . Use completely cleaned glassware, plastic or stainless steel equipment that has been rinsed in pure water. The container in which the medium is prepared should have a capacity of at least twice the volum e of the medium being prepared. Use distilled water. Add the powdered ingredients to the water and stir to dissolve. Do not shake but mix by stirring or by rotating the container. Autoclave a medium only when the ingredients are completely dissolved. Always autoclave at the correct temperat ure and for the time specified. Dispense medium in bottles or tubes in amounts convenient for use. Know the length of time prepared media can be stored without deteriorating (take into account storage temperature). Check the media prepared for sterility an d performance using standard strains. 110 Checking the pH of a culture medium The pH of most culture media is near neutral. An exception is alkaline peptone water. The simplest way of testing the pH of a culture medium is to use narrow range pH papers or a pH meter. pH should be checked before autoclaving. Sterilizing culture media The following methods are used to sterilize culture media: Autoclaving - It is important to sterilize a medium at the correct temperature and for the correct length of time as inst ructed in the method of preparation. Under -autoclaving can result in an unsterile medium which will need to be discarded. Over -autoclaving can cause precipitation, alteration of pH, and the destruction of essential components in a medium and will not suppo rt the growth of bacteria . Steaming at 100 \u0000C - This is used to sterilize media containing ingredients that would be broken down or inactivated at temperatures over 100 \u0000C, e.g. Cary -Blair transport medium. Steaming is also used to re -melt previously bottled sterile agar media. Steaming can be perfo rmed in an autoclave with the lid left loose, or in any form of steam sterilizer. The bottles of media with loosened caps are placed on perforated trays above the boiling water. After sterilization once the medium has cooled, the bottle tops are tightened. Steaming times vary according to the type of medium, e.g. 15 minutes for Cary -Blair medium. Filtration - This provides means of removing bacteria and suspended impurities from fluids. It is used to mainly to sterilize fluid additives that are heat sensiti ve and cannot be autoclaved. Examples include serum and solutions containing urea and certain carbohydrates. Cellulose filters commonly referred to as m embrane filters are the commonly used filters as they filter more rapidly, do not affect the filtrate an d absorb very little of the substance being filtered . Membrane filters are available in a variety of pore sizes, with 0.22 \u00b5m being required for sterile filtration.

Require ments : Hydrogen peroxide, 3% H 2O2 Glass rod and slides Method : 1. Place a drop of H 2 O2 on a clean glass slide 2. Using a ste rile glass rod and remove several colonies of the test organism and immerse in drop of H 2O2 3. Look for immediate bubbling Results : Active bubbling = Positive catalase test No bubbles = Negative catalase test Oxidase test The oxidase test is used to assist in the identification of Pseudomonas, Neisseria, Vibrio, Brucella, and Pasteurella species, cytochrome oxidase. Require ments : Oxidase reagent Filter slides Preparation of Oxidase Reagent: Tetramethyl -p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride 0.1 g Distilled water 10 ml Dissolve the chemical in the water . It is therefore best prepared immediately before use. Note: Some commercially available oxidase reagents are more stable and can be stored for several da ys at 2 -8\u0000C. They must be used as directed by the manufacturer. Stable oxidase reagent strips are also available. Method (fresh reagent) : 1. Place a piece of filter paper in a clean petri dish and add 2 or 3 drops of freshly prepared oxidase reagent. 2. Using a piece of stick or glass rod (not a Ni-Chrome wire loop), remove a colony of the test organism and smear it on the filter paper. 119 3. Look for the development of a blue -purple colo ur within a few seconds. Results : Blue-purple colour = Positive oxidase test(within 10 s econds) No blue -purple colour = Negative oxidase test (within 10 seconds) Citrate utilization test This test is one of several techniques used occasionally to assist in the identification of enterobacteria. The test is based on the ability of an organism to use citrate as its only source of carbon. Inoculation: 1. Using a sterile straight wire, first streak the slope with a saline suspension of the test organism and then stab the butt. 2. Incubate at 37C for 48 hours. Results : Bright blue = Positive citrate test No change in colour of medium (remains green) = Negative citrate test 120 121 Indole test Method: 1. Inculate the test organism in a tube containing 3 ml of sterile peptone water. 2. Incubate at 37 \u0000C for up to 48 h ours. 3. Test for indole by adding 0.5 ml of Kovac's reagent. Shake gently. 4. Examine for a red colo ur in the surface layer within 10 minutes. Results: Red ring = positive Indole Colourless ring = negative Indole Urease test Method (using u rea agar ): 1. Inoculate heavily the test organism in a bijou bottle containing urea agar . 2. Incubate at 37C for 3 -12 hours. 3. Look for a change in colour of the medium. Results : Pink colour = Positive urease test No pink colour or change = Negative urease test TSI (Triple Sugar Iron) test Inoculation: Use straight wire to inoculate TSI medium, first stabbing the butt and then streaking the slope in a zigzag pattern. After inoculation make sure that the tube tops are left loose. Incubate overnight at 37C. Results: Reactions are based on fermentation of lactose, sucrose and glucose and production of hydrogen sulphide (H 2S) A yellow butt (acid production) and red - pink slope indicate the fermentation of glucose only. This reaction is seen with Salmonella and Shigella species and other enteric pathogens Cracks and bubbles in the medium indicate gas production from glucose fermentation. A yellow slope and a yellow butt indicate the fermentation of glucose and lactose and/or sucrose. This occurs with E. coli , Vibrio cholerae and other enterobacteria. A red pink slope and but indicate no fermentation of any of the sugars. This is seen with most strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Blackening along the stab line or throughout the medium indicates H 2S production e.g . Salmonella Salmonella typhi Positive (pink) Negative (no change) Positive (red ring) Negative (colourless ring) 122 typhi produces a small amount of blackening while Salmonella typhimurium and Proteus (normal flora in stool) causes extensive blackening. 123 Annexure 8 TEMPERATURE RECORD OF EQUIPMENT DAILY TEMPERATURE CHART FOR REFRIGERATOR / FREEZER / INCUBA TOR / Date Temp Observed Initials Comments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 124 Annexure 9 REFERENCES 1.
