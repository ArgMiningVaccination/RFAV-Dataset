This implementation is complicated by the diverse nature of Missouri's mussel fauna and the limited personnel devoted to its conservation and assessment. A Conservation Assessment of Missouri's fauna will allow for statewide, strategic, and spatially explicit monitoring that maximizes probability of detection of population and/or distributional changes in mussel species, while minimizing costs and man-hours dedicated to monitoring programs. The creation of this program requires several steps in the research process to come to fruition, and this proposal represents one of those key steps (Figure 1). Our long-term goal is to give rise to a decision support monitoring framework specifically designed to maximize the probability of detecting species or assemblage expansions or declines in key areas of the state that are the strongholds of mussel diversity, followed by a comprehensive conservation assessment of mussels in the state, identified as High Priority Objectives (1.3, 2.1, and 2.2) in the MDC Statewide Mussel Plan. Monitoring timing and frequency will be based on probability of detection with known habitat preferences, magnitude of risk, and sampling efficiency. The first step in attaining that goal, funded in FY14, was to develop standardized sampling methods for freshwater mussels and identify factors that affect mussel capture and detection probability or affect measures of assemblage characteristics. This proposal describes the second step in a conservation assessment with a strategic monitoring protocol: identification of the fundamental properties of habitats that support diverse mussel assemblages (our biological unit of interest), with particular emphasis on geomorphological and landscape factors that best predict core areas of mussel diversity in the state (Figure 1). Both of these steps are components required in identifying biological units of interest for conservation purposes. || The Missouri Department of Conservation is frequently queried regarding the general status of endangered and threatened mussels in Missouri, a question that will remain incompletely answered until a sufficiently rigorous and comprehensive assessment and monitoring framework is implemented in Missouri.

Applying AM requires a decision tool based on region-specific vital rates for turkey populations. Current, region-specific vital rates and harvest rates are unavailable, except as expert opinion. The tool will employ a population model that predicts the dynamics of Turkey populations based on vital rates and a management model that predicts the effects of harvest regulations on vital rates. This research will estimate the temporal and spatial variation in vital rates, update the recently developed expert-driven model, test methods for monitoring decision criteria, and provide the agency with a method for incorporating the best available information in decisions regarding Turkey harvest. || | | |[ Movement dynamics, distribution, habitat use, and species associations of juvenile burbot in tributaries of the Kootenai River ](/coopunits/project/98133264384/bear4516) | December 2024 || The purpose of this project is to evaluate survival, movement, and habitat use of burbot in Deep Creek, a major tributary to the Kootenai River.

The S3 model currently under development for the Klamath River represents an integrated set of sub models that predict the effects of water management alternatives on the production of juvenile Chinook Salmon. This synchronized series of sub-models reflects the array of physical and biological processes that interact to affect the growth, movement, and survival of fish at a given lifestage. A benefit to this method of model construction lies in the ability to update sub-models as new data, new analyses, or new scientific discoveries arise. The current S3 model in development for the Klamath River tracks causes of mortality throughout the sub-adult life history of Chinook Salmon (redd scour, habitat limitations, disease, water quality, etc.) over time within 233-mile section of the mainstem Klamath River spanning from Keno Dam in Oregon to its confluence with the Pacific Ocean in California. The model is also being extended into the Trinity Basin, with the addition of an ocean component and IBM-type upstream adult migration sub module. These improvements will transform the S3 model into a basin-wide, full life cycle model. Future development of the S3 model will also include its expansion to incorporate Coho Salmon, as requested by NOAA Fisheries and the Bureau of Reclamation. || Research objectives are two-fold: 1. to evaluate the best practices for assigning flow-to-habitat relationships for large river systems; and 2. to extend the Klamath River stream salmonid simulator model, which was developed to track population dynamics of juvenile Chinook Salmon as they move from tributary to the main channel; to apply to juvenile Coho salmon. | | |[ Wildlife-Livestock Disease Transmission in a Changing Climate ](/coopunits/project/98043805696/abrenna5) | September 2018 || The goal of this project is to develop a framework for understanding the ecology of elk-cattle commingling, particularly with regards to how annual forage conditions and weather patterns influence elk movement during the critical spring/summer brucellosis transmission period. Elk habitat use and cattle grazing regimes are largely determined by the changing distribution of high-quality forage throughout the year. || ... | | |[ Landscape genetic structure of the western continental golden eagle population ](/coopunits/project/98015033344/jwcain) | July 2019 || Studies of golden eagle mortality linked to wind energy facilities are cause for concern especially when coupled with the knowledge that golden eagles move great distances between breeding and wintering areas. Thus, mortalities that occur at a particular wind energy facility may not only impact a local breeding population of golden eagles but could also impact breeding populations on a continent-wide scale. Understanding the movement ecology and landscape genetic structure of golden eagles in the western US would be critically important toward understanding the potential risks wind energy facilities pose to the continental population of golden eagles. This information is essential to understanding the distribution of breeding populations of eagles, the level of connectivity that exists among them and where individuals from these populations migrate to in the winter. Thus our objectives are to assess the relationship of western golden eagle populations using molecular genetic and stable isotope methods. || Studies of golden eagle mortality linked to wind energy facilities are cause for concern especially when coupled with the knowledge that golden eagles move great distances between breeding and wintering areas.

Maintaining these fisheries is an important goal of the Wisconsin and Michigan Departments of Natural Resources which jointly manage these fisheries. Below Sturgeon Falls, the Menominee River is divided into a series of relatively riverine impoundments by several hydropower facilities. These facilities currently prevent upstream movement of fish and probably limit downstream movements for some species. Additionally, some of these impoundments are relatively long (> 20 river miles) and some contain natural features (i.e., falls or rapids) that could limit movements of smallmouth bass. Consequently, population characteristics of smallmouth bass could vary among sections of river within the same impoundment. This spatial separation could result in situations where smallmouth bass inhabiting upstream portions of the impoundment represent important sources of recruitment for lower portions of the impoundment. Additionally, previous studies have shown that in response to falling water temperatures in fall, smallmouth bass in riverine systems move towards deeper water where they spend the winter period. During this fall-winter period, smallmouth bass could occupy relatively small, overlapping home ranges if preferred habitat is limited, making them potentially more vulnerable to anglers. Harvest of smallmouth bass during fall could negatively affect smallmouth bass fisheries in the Menominee River, but it is not known if smallmouth bass are exhibiting this behavior or if angler harvest during this period could be a problem. Recently, a few anglers have begun to voice concern over this issue and biologists are interested in determining if harvest during fall represents an important management issue. Furthermore, it is not known if current harvest regulations are sufficient to maintain the quality of these fisheries, or if more stringent regulations could improve the number of relatively large bass available to anglers. Lastly, at a larger scale, black bass (smallmouth and largemouth bass) abundance has increased in many bodies of water in the Upper Midwest and there are concerns that black bass can negatively affect walleye populations, possibly through predation or competition for available prey, consequently changes in smallmouth abundance within the Menominee River could affect other species, including walleyes. However, few studies have examined diet interactions between the two species. The Menominee River offers an excellent opportunity to evaluate dietary interactions between smallmouth bass and walleyes in a system that supports healthy populations of both species. Examining diets will also allow biologists to better understand which prey species are important to smallmouth bass and walleyes within the river. The Wisconsin and Michigan DNR rarely conduct sampling on the Menominee River that specifically targets smallmouth bass, so only limited information is available for these species. More information is needed to determine if current management strategies are appropriate for maintaining the quality of these smallmouth bass fisheries in the future.

Managers have considered the population to be performing well because it is recently introduced and has had abundant forage, however, the current status of the population and the influence of harvest, remain uncertain. This has created considerable uncertainty in how these moose should be manged (i.e., harvest levels) over the long term, and what can be done to maintain productivity and reduce the probabilility of a population decline which has become the norm for Shiras moose across much of their range. The overall goal of the proposed project is to characterize the population trajectory of moose in the Snowy Range to determine if the population is increasing or decreasing under current management. We also seek to understand the primary factors influencing population performance (especially nutrition), and to develop cost-effective tools to aid in the long-term monitoring and management. || | | |[ Phenology Tracking in Migratory Mule Deer ](/coopunits/project/97911709696/eaikens) | December 2018 || In terrestrial ecosystems, there is critical need to understand the influence of climate change on the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in forage conditions and the wildlife species that depend on it.

Environmental DNA is a cost-effective and noninvasive technique that has been successfully applied to a broad range of taxonomic groups, including fishes. Studies show that environmental DNA can closely track presence/absence and can be useful for monitoring species that cannot be detected using conventional field approaches. Despite apparent promise, insufficient testing has been conducted to determine the suitability of environmental DNA (eDNA) approaches for monitoring Tidewater Goby. This project has two major phases: 1. develop and test eDNA techniques, and 2. apply eDNA techniques for presence/absence detection in natural settings. This proposal is for the second phase. During this second phase, Humboldt State University and USFWS will collaborate to survey 15 water bodies in northern California to 1. employ traditional field surveys techniques for Tidewater Goby, 2. collect 1-5 water samples from each site and test water samples for tidewater presence/absence of Tidewater Goby DNA, and 3. evaluate suitability of QPCR for determining the presence/absence and/or relative abundance of Tidewater Goby. || This project proposes to assess the potential of using environmental DNA in water samples as a tool for monitoring the endangered Tidewater Goby in lagoon and bay habitats.

The proposed project will support recovery and monitoring efforts of the FWS and various conservation partners and help inform conservation decisions. || Several cave species are also known to occur within the Ozark region including several federally-listed endangered or petitioned species. The distribution and abundance of these cave crayfish are largely unknown: some species are thought to be very rare and endemic to only one or a few caves. Our research investigates new techniques for studying cave fish and cave crayfish populations in the Ozark Highlands ecoregion of Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. Our objective is to assess the usefulness of environmental DNA sampling to determine the presence of these rare cave fauna. This project is a collaborative effort across multiple agencies including the Missouri Department of Conservation, Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, The Nature Conservancy, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (funding agency), and The U.S. Forest Service. We will develop a model using our results to determine detection probability of traditional cave surveys along with use of eDNA. We will also provide surveillance of more than 30 caves, springs, and wells across the area that should provide useful information to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and partner agencies to base protection and recovery actions. | | |[ Angler behavior in response to management actions on Nebraska reservoirs -- Part 2 ](/coopunits/project/86625398784/oliviadarugna) | December 2018 || There exists interplay between angler participation and quality of fish in a lake. Variability in recruitment of fish among lakes should increase dispersion in densities of fish across a region, whereas movement of anglers among lakes should decrease dispersion in densities of fish across a region. Unlike fishery management efforts that in general operate on a local scale (i.e., single lake), these counteractive forces are likely stronger on a regional scale. Thus, incorporation of spatial and temporal patterns in angler participation into fishery management likely will require a shift in focus from lake-specific management to regional management. This shift in focus would be facilitated by an understanding of angler-participation patterns. The goals of this study are to understand 1) the participation patterns of anglers on multiple spatial and temporal scales; 2) how participation patterns of anglers' influence fish populations and associated communities; 3) how management actions influence angler participation patterns and, in turn, fish communities; and 4) interactions and feedback mechanisms between and among angler groups and fish communities. Study findings should help biologists better determine appropriate lake-specific management objectives given the dynamic nature of angler participation and its interrelationship with fish populations. || Recreational fishing is the most influential factor structuring fish populations, especially in inland systems with intensive fishing pressure. Anglers often target apex predators such as largemouth bass and walleye, which can have important consequences for fish communities in lakes and reservoirs via top-down controls. To complicate matters, predator dynamics among fishes vary spatially (e.g., within and among reservoirs) and temporally (e.g., within and among years), as does angler participation. Even so, inland fishery biologists rarely incorporate spatial and temporal patterns, which also occur in angler participation and catches, into management strategies, possibly because little is understood about angler decisions to participate in the sport. Incorporation of spatial and temporal patterns in angler participation into fishery management likely will require a shift in focus from lake-specific management to regional management. This shift in focus would be facilitated by better understanding of factors affecting angler participation and harvest decisions. This project is a collaboration of researchers across multiple agencies and includes the University of Nebraska\u2014Lincoln and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission. Information gained on angler behavior will be important for increased effectiveness of fishery management, as well as increased effectiveness of angler recruitment and retention activities. | | |[ Identifying recruitment bottlenecks for walleyes in northern Wisconsin lakes ](/coopunits/project/85404239872/jcgostiaux) | December 2018 || Recruitment failure has been observed in some northern Wisconsin walleye Sander vitreus populations that formerly supported moderate to high levels of recruitment. Recruitment is measured using catch-per-effort of age-0 walleyes in fall electrofishing surveys, so recruitment bottlenecks are occurring in the first year of life. Recruitment failure could be linked to a variety of factors, including changes in habitat availability and fish communities within these lakes. Initially, predation by largemouth bass (a species that has experienced widespread increases in abundance) was thought to be a potential factor regulating walleye recruitment. Previous work conducted by the Wisconsin Cooperative Fishery Research Unit and others has demonstrated that largemouth bass predation is probably not a limiting factor in the walleye recruitment process. However, other species may have also experienced increases in abundance (e.g., black crappies, bluegills) and modeling conducted by Center for Limnology at UW-Madison suggests that the time at which walleyes enter the littoral zone after a pelagic larval stage could determine the degree to which predation affects recruitment. Furthermore, recent work from Ontario and Wisconsin has indicated that loss of suitable optical and thermal habitat may be affecting survival and recruitment of young walleyes. In collaboration with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, we are initiating an intensive study of walleye early life history. This work will encompass a range of walleye populations, including those that have exhibited recent recruitment failure and populations that exhibit high levels of recruitment on a relatively consistent basis. Our primary objectives are to determine if: 1) larval and juvenile walleye abundance, survival, foraging success, diet composition, and growth vary among populations; 2) predation by northern pike, black crappies, bluegill, and yellow perch could affect walleye recruitment; 3) availability of suitable optical and thermal habitat varies among lakes in relation to walleye recruitment patterns and 4) zooplankton abundance, community composition, and size structure varies in relation to larval growth and survival and subsequent recruitment. Additionally, we will identify when age-0 walleyes enter the littoral zone to improve model projections regarding the effects of predation on walleye year class strength. || Project in development for January 2019 | | |[ Conservation of the Critically Endangered Chinese Crested Tern: Restoration of a Lost Breeding Colony ](/coopunits/project/82023770112/daniel.roby) | March 2019 || In the latter half of the 20th Century, Chinese Crested Terns (Sterna bernsteini) were presumed to be extinct, with no documented observations after 1937. In 2000, however, Chinese Crested Terns were rediscovered nesting in the Matzu Islands of the Taiwan Strait. Subsequent surveys by Chinese ornithologists revealed an additional breeding site in the Jiushan Islands of Xiangshan County, Zhejiang Province. Human disturbance - fisherman collecting eggs - later caused the abandonment of this colony. Despite their recent rediscovery, Chinese Crested Terns are still considered one of the most endangered seabird species in the world and one of the most critically endangered vertebrate species. Recovery of this species is possible, however, if nesting habitat can be established and protected. The goal of this project is to restore the Chinese Crested Tern to the Jiushan Islands, using techniques of social attraction and colony monitoring successfully applied to seabird restoration projects throughout the world. The specific proposal to the Wildlife Without Borders program was to fund the manufacture of Chinese Crested Tern decoys and solar-powered audio playback systems to play recordings of Chinese Crested Tern calls. Terns are highly gregarious colonial-nesting species which can be attracted to sites with suitable nesting habitat using decoys and recorded calls. This equipment would play an important role in the effort to restore Chinese Crested Terns to a former nesting area. The restoration project is a collaborative effort of several Chinese and American institutions (Xiangshan County Marine and Fishery Bureau, Zhejiang Natural History Museum, Oregon State University, and the U.S. Geological Survey - Oregon Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit). Support from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Wildlife Without Borders program has furthered this international collaboration to save one of the world's most critically endangered animals. || Chinese Crested Terns are likely the most endangered seabird species in eastern Asia, and a flagship species for seabird conservation in China. The estimated global population of breeding adult Chinese Crested Terns is barely 100. The main threats to the species are illegal egg harvest and the increasing intensity and frequency of typhoons in the East China Sea. This restoration project seeks to establish a dispersed network of safe, protected breeding colony sites for the common colony associate species for Chinese Crested Terns, the Greater Crested Tern, as a means to provide nesting habitat and enhance reproductive success of Chinese Crested Terns. The project is a collaboration since 2010 with the Zhejiang Museum of Natural History, Hangzhou, PR China, and a variety of bird conservation NGOs in China. The research project seeks to identify those factors currently limiting the reproductive success and population size of Chinese Crested Terns, their migratory routes, and over-wintering range using a combination of satellite telemetry and field readable leg band technologies. | | |[ Evaluation of Caspian tern management to reduce predation on ESA-listed salmonids in the Columbia Plateau region ](/coopunits/project/82023249920/daniel.roby) | March 2019 || This study is designed to evaluate the foraging behavior and colony connectivity of Caspian terns (Hydroprogne caspia) nesting on Goose Island in Potholes Reservoir, with particular emphasis on predation by terns from this colony on ESA-listed juvenile salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) from the upper Columbia River. || Caspian terns nesting at the two largest breeding colonies for the species on the Columbia Plateau have been shown to cause significant mortality to out-migrating juvenile salmonids in the Columbia and Snake rivers. | | |[ Demographics and habitat use of Greater Sage-Grouse in wildfire-affected habitats in Oregon. ](/coopunits/project/77763158016/digger) | June 2023 || Southeast Oregon contains part of one of the largest contiguous sage-brush steppe habitats remaining within the extant range of greater sage-grouse. During the summer of 2012, several large wildfires included more than 1 million acres of Oregon sage-grouse habitat within their perimeters.

In this research, we developed a coupled human-landscape model that incorporates the linkages and feedbacks among atmospheric, terrestrial, aquatic, and social processes to predict the potential impact of climate variability, climate change, land use, and human activity on water resources. This component of the project addresses both how fish communities are affected by natural and anthropogenic drivers, as well as, how these biotic effects interact with social science drivers and policy options. This research matters because without considering both natural and human systems, environmental professionals will never be able to attain sustainable resource conservation plans. The partners for the fish component of this research were the National Science Foundation (CNH) and Ecological Services Division of the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism. This research informs decisions. Specifically, our aquatic ecology results showed that drivers of watershed scale fish biodiversity vary regionally. Urbanization reduced fish biodiversity in the lower river. Disturbed conditions (low grassland, low flow) associated with a reduction in the desired historical condition (high grassland, high mean flow) reduced fish biodiversity in the middle and upper regions of the watershed. In the integrated model, these results were linked to policies that protect land and water resources. This project has high impact because successful conservation demands that natural patterns of biodiversity and human behavior be considered together, as we do in this project. || Humans adversely impact aquatic resources through land use, water removal, dam building, and altered biodiversity.

Here, we present the results of a multi-year, non-native brown trout (<i>Salmo trutta</i>) removal and native Bonneville trout (<i>Oncorhynchus clarkii utah</i>) recovery in a small tributary in the Intermountain West, USA. We monitored trout populations for seven years prior to the onset of eradication efforts, which included two years of mechanical removal followed by two years of chemical treatment. Cutthroat trout populations were then seeded with low numbers of both eggs and juvenile trout. We monitored population demographics and estimated population growth rates and carrying capacities for both populations from long-term depletion estimate data, assuming logistic growth. Prior to eradication, brown trout populations fluctuated around their carrying capacity. Following brown trout eradication and initial seeding efforts, cutthroat trout populations have demonstrated exponential growth. Within five years, cutthroat trout have approached their estimated carrying capacity. Population projections suggest a 50% probability that cutthroat trout are currently at or above 90% of their carrying capacity, and that there is an 80 to 90% probability they will be at or above 90% of their carrying capacity within 10 years. Additionally, at least four age-classes are present including adults large enough to satisfy angling demand. This project is a collaboration of biologists, academics, and anglers and includes the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources , U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station, the local chapter of Trout Unlimited - Cache Anglers, and the Ecology Center at Utah State University. These results demonstrate native trout species have substantial capacity to rapidly recover following the removal of invasive species in otherwise minimally altered habitats. While these locations are likely limited in extent individually, collectively they may serve as source populations for larger connected systems. In such cases, these source populations may provide additional conservation potential through biotic resistance. || While the importance of reducing the impacts of non-native species is increasingly recognized in conservation, the feasibility of such actions is highly dependent upon several key uncertainties including the stage of invasion, the size of the ecosystem being restored, and the magnitude of the restoration activity.

However, these rivers can be important for fisheries management and conservation as they may provide refuge and inter-basin movement corridors for smaller-stream fishes during drought, possess unique habitats and resources for larger-river fishes moving into these systems during floods, and offer buffer capacity because their floodplains may be less modified than big rivers and thus create substantial productivity and refuge for downstream systems. Knowing how mid-sized rivers are used by big river and smaller-stream fishes, and to what degree these rivers have their own unique fish communities, will help the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) identify important rivers to target for conservation and restoration. The methods developed and data collected by this project would provide a tool for developing standardized sampling protocols for fish communities in rivers from MDC priority watersheds and other watersheds, and help DNR in the development of fish biocriteria for large rivers. | | |[ Ecology of swift fox in Nebraska ](/coopunits/project/77231124480/luciacorral) | December 2018 || Swift fox, (Vulpes velox) is a small species of fox native to short- and mixed- grass prairies of the Great Plains, including Western Nebraska where they are listed as a Tier-1 at-risk species. Habitat loss is a major contributor to population declines with only 40% of Nebraska still containing suitable grassland habitat. Still, swift fox do not occupy all suitable habitat. Why might a species fail to use seemingly good habitat? Coyotes might be the answer. Unlike swift fox, coyotes are highly adaptable, and, as their bigger cousin, can displace swift fox from otherwise suitable habitat. Coyotes may gain further advantages when grasslands are converted for agricultural and energy development. Thus, swift fox conservation requires understanding where swift fox roam and how they interact with coyotes and people. It isn't easy surveying the entire western third of Nebraska for a nocturnal species that spends much of its time hidden in dens. Because most swift fox habitat is on private land, our efforts to study where swift fox live, and why, require us to collaborate with privates landowners throughout western Nebraska, as well as students from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Chadron State College. Together, we work to understand how best to conserve swift fox in the face of change. || In Nebraska, the loss and degradation of grasslands has significantly impacted many grassland species, including the swift fox (Vulpes velox). A Nebraska Natural Legacy Plan Tier-1 at risk species, swift fox are estimated to occupy as little as 20-25% of their historic range; however, despite their Tier-1 status, little is known about the true distribution of swift fox. With increasing interest in developing infrastructure in Western Nebraska for gas, oil, and wind energy there is a clear need to document the distribution of swift fox, and identify threats to swift fox populations. Traditional studies of species distribution focus on identifying the habitat attributes, most notably vegetation, that best predict the spatial patterns observed in nature. However, in canid systems, there is clear evidence that intraguild interactions play an important role in predicting species distribution and habitat use, especially for smaller canid species. As the largest extant canid in the shortgrass prairie, coyote are dominant to swift fox and often cited as an important source of mortality. As such, increases in the abundance and distribution of coyote following the development of the western Nebraska may have inadvertently restricted the range of swift fox despite the availability of suitable vegetative conditions. Starting in 2013, the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, the Nebraska Department of Roads, the Nebraska Environmental Trust, and the U.S. Forest Service - Nebraska National Forests and Grasslands working in collaboration with the Nebraska Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Chadron State College began a five year project to document the occurrence of swift fox in Western Nebraska and identify the anthropogenic and ecological factors that limit swift fox distribution. Our goal is to identify where swift fox are located and identify the ecological mechanisms shaping the distribution of canid communities in Nebraska by developing and testing a series of species distribution models based on the habitat requirements and intraguild interactions of Nebraska's canid community | | |[ The Gulf of Maine coastal ecosystem survey: an integrated, multidisciplinary effort to map biological hotspots in the waters of Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts (Collaborators: C.

Several carnivore species occur in New York, and in addition to their ecological importance, they have economic and recreational value to humans as fur-bearing species. Understanding the factors that influence their spatial distribution can help managers ensure the maintenance of sustainable populations. These factors can include environmental variables that determine the suitability of habitat for a particular species or their main prey, as well as the potential for negative interspecific interactions arising from competition and intraguild predation in areas where they occur in sympatry. Occupancy models are a useful tool to determine the occurrence of species as a function of environmental covariates across the landscape, while accounting for imperfect detection. In addition, more recently developed multispecies occupancy models can elucidate the effects of interspecific interactions on species occupancy. From 2013-2015, we collaborated with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) to conduct a non-invasive survey across western portions of New York. Results from the fisher survey resulted in the opening of conservative trapping seasons (6 days) in new wildlife management units (WMU) previously closed to trapping, based on a minimum threshold predicted occupancy level of 0.41. We are using the same fisher detection data, along with additional data on bobcats, coyotes, and red foxes in multispecies occupancy models to explore hypotheses regarding interspecific interactions and environmental correlates in determining species occupancy. These studies demonstrate the efficiency and value of large-scale camera-trapping surveys, which can detect multiple species at once. Both single-species and multispecies occupancy models can provide managers with useful information that can be used to guide decisions on harvest, conservation of habitat, and population management. || We will estimate density of American marten and develop occupancy models for a suite of carnivore species (marten, fisher, bobcat, coyote, red fox) in New York.

Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife is interested in understanding the effects of these drawdowns on fish and wildlife that use the lakes. The project will begin with a literature review of the effects of lake drawdowns on fish and wildlife, and an assessment of the scope (location, timing, amount, rate, etc.) of drawdowns in Massachusetts. This will be followed by a field project assessing the impacts of drawdowns on lake fauna. || Anthropogenic alteration of water levels in lakes is a major stressor to the ecological integrity of littoral zones, which provide critical heterogenous resources that support diverse biological communities. Annual winter drawdowns have used in Massachusetts (MA) for several decades as a macrophyte control technique, among other purposes; however, few studies have estimated impacts to littoral zone habitat and biological communities, particularly at relatively mild magnitudes (i.e., <2 m). This collaborative project with the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife will characterize winter drawdown hydrological regimes and estimate responses of physical habitat (macrophytes, sediment texture, coarse wood), macroinvertebrate assemblages, and mussel assemblages to variable levels of drawdown magnitude. Results are critical for understanding the scope of drawdowns in Massachusetts and will more broadly assist agencies in evaluating lake management techniques and determining management options that minimize losses to lake ecosystem integrity. | | |[ Deer abundance and its relationship to factors that affect forest vegetation conditions ](/coopunits/project/65403580416/dfb5098) | June 2026 || In the last decade, deer densities were reduced in many Wildlife Management Units (WMU) in Pennsylvania.

Additionally, the application of the Deer Management Assistance Program (DMAP) on state forest lands has been questioned because DMAP has been used by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry (BOF) to attempt to reduce the effect of deer browsing on forest vegetation.<br><br>The PGC needs a better understanding of how the deer browsing impact measure is related to deer densities and whether this measure is valuable for making deer harvest decisions. Similarly, the BOF needs to better understand how the application of the DMAP affects deer harvest and hunter behavior. Both agencies require a better understanding of how vegetation responds to changes in deer density in the context of existing monitoring programs and management activities.<br><br>This research proposes to stabilize deer populations at different densities on four study areas and quantify changes in vegetation with respect to other forest conditions (seed production, advanced tree regeneration, etc.) and management actions (e.g., herbicide to remove competing vegetation). || The forests of Pennsylvania have problems with tree regeneration and a lack of diversity in understory plant species. White-tailed deer herbivory has been identified as one problem source. However, other factors such as insect outbreaks, acid deposition, competitive effects among plant species, and lack of fire have been identified as other potential causes. <br><br>Deer populations were reduced by about 23% during 2002-2005 yet problems with forest plant diversity remains. An important question is whether deer populations require further reduction or other factors may be playing an important role in affecting forested ecosystems.<br><br>This study is a collaboration of the Pennsylvania Game Commission, Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry, and the USGS Pennsylvania Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit at The Pennsylvania State University.<br><br>In this study we are monitoring changes in deer density and the response in forest understory vegetation. In addition, we are conducting experiments to study the relative importance of liming and using herbicide to reduce interspecific plant competition. The results of this research will inform the Pennsylvania Game Commission on how their habitat metrics used to make deer harvest recommendations respond to changes in deer density. In addition, this study will help the Bureau of Forestry refine their monitoring program on state forest lands used to make deer management decisions. | | |[ Avian Predation on Juvenile Salmonids in the Lower Columbia River ](/coopunits/project/61190729728/daniel.roby) | January 2019 || Long-term research, monitoring, and evaluation project investigating the impact of piscivorous colonial waterbirds on survival of ESA-listed salmonids from the Columbia River basin. || Avian predation on juvenile salmonids has been identified as a limiting factor for restoration of a number of ESA-listed salmonid species in the Columbia River basin. In particular, several species of piscivorous colonial waterbirds, including Caspian terns, double-crested cormorants, California gulls, and ring-billed gulls, have been found to consume more than 2% of out-migrating smolts in some listed populations. The research, monitoring, and evaluation funded by this project is intended to quantify the magnitude of smolt losses to avian predators, design and in some cases implement management actions, when warranted, to reduce avian predation rates on ESA-listed salmonids, and evaluate the efficacy of management actions for enhancing survival of juvenile salmonids. The RM&E that is part of this project is supported by the Bonneville Power Administration, the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, NOAA Fisheries, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The research results from this project have been used to design and implement three different management plans to reduce avian predation rates on Columbia Basin salmonid smolts, including two management plans in the Columbia River estuary and one in the Columbia Plateau region. These management plans have substantially reduced predation rates by Caspian terns and double-crested cormorants on some populations of Columbia Basin salmonids. | | |[ Wyoming Range Native Fish and Energy Development ](/coopunits/project/60534196224/mollenh) | June 2021 || The rapid expansion of natural gas development has raised concerns about potential effects of energy development for fish and wildlife.

But corridors are facing new and ongoing threats, and their conservation is constrained by a still-incomplete understanding of migration ecology and by misconceptions among public stakeholders. In 2012, we created the Wyoming Migration Initiative (WMI) to enhance our research program, translate our research into actionable conservation tools, and expand our education and outreach to public and agency cooperators. The WMI has a broad goal of understanding and conserving ungulate migration routes through 1) migration research, 2) the development of conservation tools, 3) and public outreach and education. We conduct this work in collaboration with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department in addition to a wide variety of other state and federal partners and conservation groups. Current research is focused on mapping undocumented corridors and studying the benefits and challenges of long-distance migration. Our work on conservation tools focuses on creating a powerful archive of corridor data that can guide on-the-ground conservation and policy. Our outreach and education programs continue to tell the story of migration to a broad audience, focusing on \"live\" tracking of migrations, compelling new videos, storytelling, and resources for K-12 instructors. || Wyoming's ungulate migrations, like the vast landscapes on which they occur, are a vital part of the state's cultural heritage.

This information will improve management for an At-Risk species that breeds on many DoD installations in the west. This is the first year of a 3-year project and one that builds upon a past Legacy project to address a critical need that was identified at a recent DoD-sponsored workshop in Oregon. The project represents a large collaborative partnership among 17 organizations including working closely with the Canadian Department of Defense and the Canadian Wildlife Service on this project. The use of this exciting new technology on this declining species will undoubtedly generate substantial positive media coverage that will benefit DoD and the Legacy program. The results will identify priority management needs for this declining species and help reduce conflict with the military mission on DoD installations. <br><br>Benefits to the DoD:<br>The project will benefit the DoD in general and also the 6 (or more) participating DoD installations throughout the western U.S. by providing explicit detailed information on the migratory timing, migratory routes, and wintering locations of burrowing owls that breed on DoD lands. This information is an important benefit, because without this knowledge, DoD will likely be expected to assume more and more of the management responsibility (or blame) for ensuring the persistence of burrowing owls in the U.S. as populations continue to decline. Without any knowledge of where owls on DoD installations migrate and overwinter, the only entity that can be made responsible for burrowing owls breeding on installations is DoD. Hence, greater knowledge of where \"DoD owls\" go during the migratory and wintering seasons will help spread the responsibility among the appropriate agencies, landowners, and countries. The project will also benefit the DoD because identifying the routes that burrowing owls take as they leave from (and return to) each participating installation during the spring and fall migratory seasons will help DoD personnel develop plans to minimize BASH problems. Knowing the migratory routes (and timing) that owls take as they leave the base each fall and return each spring will help guide practical decisions such as where NOT to install artificial burrows relative to runways (to avoid bird strikes). This knowledge will also help identify problems related to towers that are causing unnecessary mortality during migratory movements. And identifying the specific migratory corridors/routes will allow military commanders greater flexibility in using DoD lands that are outside of these corridors. The results may also help prevent burrowing owls from being listed as threatened or endangered by state and federal agencies in the U.S. Burrowing owls are already listed as federally endangered in Canada, and are listed as state endangered in several U.S. states. They have been petitioned for listing in several other U.S. states in recent years. Identifying migratory patterns and potential causes of decline on the wintering grounds will allow us to potentially reverse declines sooner and thereby prevent this species from being listed federally in the U.S. The results of this project will also identify critical areas along important migratory routes that need to be preserved and thereby identify key areas to target for habitat protection and restoration efforts. Finally, the project will benefit the DoD because it will help further identify DoD as a leader in the conservation of burrowing owls. As populations decline and more aggressive conservation measures are taken to ensure burrowing owl persistence, regulatory agencies will be able to see that DoD was funding projects to help conserve this high-profile species from the outset. Use of this exciting, new technology (Geolocators) to identify migratory patterns and wintering areas of a high-profile species-at-risk will undoubtedly generate substantial media interest. Indeed, we have already been contacted by the National Geographic Society who learned about our plans and want to help fund the project so that they can highlight it in their media outlets. The DoD and the Legacy program would benefit from such positive media coverage and would be identified as the leader of this effort. This project is a good example of integrating the goals of DoD's Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans (INRMPs) with those of the State Wildlife Action Plans (SWAPs) because burrowing owls are listed in INRMPs on many installations in the western U.S. and in the SWAPs of many western states. Moreover, most regional management planning efforts in the western U.S. (e.g., multi-species conservation plans such as the Sonoran Desert Ecosystem Initiative) include burrowing owl as a focal species. The proposed effort will undoubtedly be viewed as a crosscutting project using cutting-edge technology with partners in 3 countries to identify migratory pathways and wintering grounds of a high-profile species of international conservation concern. Burrowing owls appear to be changing their migratory behavior in response to global change (Macias-Duarte 2011); this project will provide the piece of the puzzle currently missing (exact wintering locations) that would allow us to fully evaluate the extent of those changes. DoD would benefit from participating as a leader in this national and international conservation initiative on burrowing owls, and would help ensure that DoD interests are given proper consideration in future conservation plans. This project will be run through the Desert Southwest Cooperative Ecosystems Studies Unit (DSCESU). Hence, the project will further demonstrate DoD's commitment to the CESU program and will help encourage additional partners to contribute to the project. <br><br><br> || Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) were once a common breeder in grasslands throughout North America but are now listed as a Species of National Conservation Concern in the U.S. Despite population declines, burrowing owls are present on many DoD installations throughout the western U.S. This project will identify wintering grounds and migratory routes of burrowing owls nesting on DoD lands through the use of geolocators.

The current framework includes a safe yield approach to allocation, biological categorization of streams using fish communities as a surrogate for aquatic integrity, and streamflow criteria (http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/eea/water/framework-draft-feb03-2012.pdf). The approach for setting streamflow standards was based on estimates of flow alteration indicators (based on groundwater withdrawals and discharges), and relationships between estimated flow alteration and fluvial fish assemblages. Although the SWMI process is continuing with existing data, researchers identified the lack of information about flow alteration due to surface water withdrawals from reservoirs as a major information gap. <br><br>The overall goal of this research is to quantify flow alteration due to surface water withdrawals from reservoirs and the relationship between in-stream flow and biotic assemblages downstream of water supply reservoirs. This project involves collecting stream stage, fishes, and macroinvertebrates downstream of water supply reservoirs, and comparing that to non-supply reservoirs and unimpounded streams. We will select streams with similar size watersheds, but varying levels of water withdrawal. Streams will be continuously gaged with pressure transducers, and we will compare actual flows with the monthly withdrawals reported by the water suppliers. We will also investigate relationships between flow and temperature alteration, fish assemblages, and macroinvertebrate assemblages to determine the aspects of the flow and temperature regime that predict biotic assemblages. || Surface water reservoirs used for public water supply are common throughout the landscape and can greatly disrupt stream flow regimes. Predicting effects of water withdrawals on downstream flows and aquatic ecosystems is particularly challenging due to variation in withdrawal and dam management and characteristics of the watershed, reservoir, and streams. This project is a collaboration with the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. Our hydrologic monitoring in streams will help to understand variability in flow alteration and directly link hydrology to biotic responses, which is critical for making decisions on how to manage water supply while protecting stream ecosystems. | | |[ Landscape-scale management of forest wildlife populations in Wisconsin ](/coopunits/project/59628777472/cmschmitz2) | July 2024 || Conservation of species has shifted from single site efforts to landscape-scale approaches due to the scale at which forest management operates.

Across the Midwest agroecosystems have historically served as important habitat for pheasants, but the intensification of agricultural has significantly altered the landscape resulting in a long-term decline in pheasant populations. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has helped to mitigate habitat loss and slow the rate of population decline, but enrollment in CRP is declining. Given the importance of pheasants to Nebraska, managers are interested in developing programs that will continue to support pheasant populations while ensuring hunting opportunities. In southwest Nebraska, the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission intensively manages for pheasant habitat and pheasant hunting opportunities with the goal of producing the best pheasant hunting experience for the most hunters. Starting in 2012 we began working with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission to monitor pheasants and pheasant hunters in the region to better understand how pheasants use managed agroecosystems, how hunters perceive and use public access, and how pheasants and pheasant hunters interact. Since the start of the project we have captured and radio collared hundreds of pheasants and recorded thousands of locations on where pheasants are roosting, eating, loafing and nesting. At these locations we have collected information on vegetation characteristics, climatic conditions, and food resources to understand the ecological needs of pheasants. To understand changing population dynamics, we monitor the survival of pheasants throughout the year and each spring we monitor 20-70 nests collecting information on reproductive investment and success. We also monitor seasonal movements of pheasants and responses to management and regulations such as the opening of the hunting season or wheat stubble management. In addition to monitoring pheasants we are collecting information on hunter movements and harvest to understand how hunters interact with pheasants in the field. The findings from this study are helping us to understand the complex dynamics between how uncontrollable factors such as weather interact with habitat and harvest management to affect pheasant population dynamics in an intensively managed ecosystem. || Ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) are a culturally and economically important game species.

Moose are generalist browsers and, coupled with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), can have long-term influences on the structure and composition of forest ecosystems. We set out to understand these relationships by constructing 15 20 x 20 m exclosures in a randomized block design with 3 treatment levels: (1) no-ungulates (full exclosure), (2) deer only (partial exclosure), and (3) deer + moose (control, i.e., no fence). During the first phase of this research, we discovered that in logged forests, moose and deer used the cuts at roughly the same frequency despite moose densities being much lower than deer densities. Moose were the dominant browser and after 6-7 years of browsing, deer + moose reduced stem densities and basal area by 2-3-fold, cherry and oak recruitment by 3-6 fold, and species richness by 1.7 species (19%). Browsing resulted in greater herbaceous species richness and greater woody species richness than ungulate exclusion and deer alone. Our initial results illustrate the complex interactions that two native browser can have on forests, with implications for understanding forest ecological dynamics and timber management. The Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, Harvard University, Highstead Foundation, and U. S. Forest Service collaborated on this research. We will continue with this long-term study through various stages of forest development. The information will be used by conservation and management agencies to further understand wildlife-forest habitat relationships and the role they play in forest ecology, animal community dynamics, watershed management, and production of timber and other forest products. | | |[ Responses of large mammals to forest restoration treatments and wildfire in the southwest Jemez Mountains, New Mexico ](/coopunits/project/41565216769/leahw42) | April 2025 || Decades of fire suppression, overgrazing, and logging in the western U.S. have resulted in increased tree densities, altered habitat conditions for many wildlife species, and increased risk of stand-replacing wildfires. Land managers are currently implementing landscape-scale treatments in efforts to mitigate catastrophic wildfires and to restore historical forest conditions. The goals of this project are to monitor the responses of mule deer, elk, black bear, and mountain lion to forest restoration treatments and wildfires as part of the Southwest Jemez Mountains Collaborative Forest Restoration Project. Specifically, we are assessing changes in forage conditions, movements, and resource selection of mule deer, elk, black bear and mountain lion in relation to prescribed fires, restoration thinning, and previous wildfires. The results of this project will allow for more informed design and implementation of restoration treatments that simultaneously mitigate wildfire risk and enhance habitat conditions for mule deer, elk, black bears and mountain lions. This research is in collaboration between the New Mexico Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, Department of Natural Resources Management at Texas Tech University, National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, Jemez Pueblo, and New Mexico Department of Game and Fish. || Decades of fire suppression, overgrazing, and logging in the western U.S. have resulted in increased tree densities, altered habitat conditions for many wildlife species, and increased risk of stand-replacing wildfires.

We used the fieldtested Stream Segment Temperature model (U.S. Geological Survey) to simulate how altering discharge, groundwater input, channel wetted width, and shade prevents the temperatures of White Mountain, Arizona, stream reaches from exceeding the thermal tolerance of Apache Trout <i>Oncorhynchus apache</i>, both under existing conditions and under a climate change scenario. Simulations suggested increasing shade, either through streamside planting of specific numbers and species of plants or by other means, would be most effective and feasible for cooling the stream reaches we studied. Ponderosa pine <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> and Douglas fir <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> provided the most followed in willow <i>Salix exigua</i>. Vegetation survival depends on the appropriateness of site conditions at present and under climate change, and planting in buffer strips minimizes additional water removal from the watershed through evapotranspiration. Alternative shading options, including thick sedge growth, shade cloth, or felled woody vegetation, may be considered when environmental conditions do not support plantings. Increasing groundwater input can cool streams, but additional sources are scarce in the region. Decreasing the widthtodepth ratio would succeed best on reaches with widths greater than 2.0 m. Increasing discharge from upstream may lower water temperature on reaches with an initial discharge greater than 0.5 m<sup>3</sup>/s. Existing models provide suggestions to cool stream reaches. Further development of accessible software packages that incorporate evaporation, fragmentation, and other projected climate change effects into their routines will provide additional tools to help manage climate change effects.

Thus far, there have been some very simple predictions on how climate change will affect temperature, especially in more northern latitudes. As ectotherms, fish are affected directly by any changes in temperature, which can range from altering foraging, reproduction, metabolism, migration timing, etc. In the Connecticut River, anadromous fish (e.g., Atlantic salmon sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus)) are predicted to change migration patterns in relation to climate change. The life cycle complexity of migratory species introduces several unknowns regarding the transitions from freshwater to marine and back, and from tributary to mainstem in some species. The changing thermal regime will be accompanied by changes in discharge as a component of the altered water cycle. Predictions of changes in shorter-term weather patterns include more severe events; e.g., a tornado occurred in Vermont on May 9, 2009 and Hurricane Irene caused major damage in Vermont tributaries in August 2011. This backdrop provides an opportunity to expand on our previous modeling of Atlantic salmon migration in the Connecticut River. We explored how temperature, discharge, and the indirect effects of dams (by creating delays in migration) were related to survival of Atlantic salmon smolts. We worked in this area for several years using data from previous monitoring and research. The final phase of our efforts was to model juvenile American shad migration in response to changing environmental conditions. || In the Connecticut River, anadromous fish (e.g., Atlantic sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus)) are predicted to change migration patterns in relation to climate change.

Notably, a single (state threatened) population of RGC inhabits Little Aguja Creek in the Davis Mountains, Texas. Because the Little Aguja population is isolated, recolonization from other populations is not possible. Thus, RGC in Texas may be highly susceptible to catastrophic events (e.g., wildfire, severe drought) as the Chihuahuan Desert region becomes hotter and drier. As part of a range-wide status assessment, Texas has committed to assess and monitor the status of known populations of RGC and their habitats to track changes over time. A primary goal of the agreement is to maintain the long-term viability (i.e., self-sustaining wild populations) of RGC within their historical range. Additionally, surveys are needed to identify other streams that could support RGC as part of future efforts to establish new populations. Such proactive measures may improve long-term viability and preclude the listing of RGC under the ESA. The primary objectives of our study are to (1) assess the status (e.g., presence/absence, abundance) and habitat associations (e.g., depth, sediments, riparian cover) of the RGC population in Little Aguja Creek, (2) deploy environmental sensors (temperature, pressure transducers) to establish baselines with respect to water quality and quantity, and (3) engage private landowners and solicit permission to assess streams for RGC and identify areas where managed translocations or reintroduction may be suitable. This project is in collaboration with Texas Parks and Wildlife and The Nature Conservancy.

Informal comparisons across boundaries have revealed that YLM populations occur in a variety of habitats throughout its range. In some portions of their range they are found only in medium and large rivers; in others, they more commonly occur in lakes and ponds. YLM has been described as inhabiting a variety of substrates and flow conditions, with some studies suggesting a preference for riffles and strong currents and others locating YLM in slow currents around sandbars. The presence of YLM in varied habitat types across its range suggests that populations may be impacted by different stressors and different approaches may be needed for conservation.

Our ability to accurately define stream habitats based on their thermal regime (i.e., cold, cool, and warm) and identify unique aquatic communities with species assemblages that are distinct from one another is limited by the availability of data across the diversity of Missouri stream habitat types. The purpose of this project is to estimate the distribution and extent of significant cold water stream habitats, including describing associated aquatic species communities within those habitats and in transition zones, for use in making recommendations to assist development of thermal criteria for Missouri streams. Data from this project will improve our understanding on the extent of cold and cool water species, longitudinal changes in thermal habitats, and the abiotic conditions that help define the boundaries. This information could contribute to conservation strategies for species of conservation concern, especially those species with a limited distribution and associated with spring-fed streams. Initial discussions with MDC have indicated the results of this study could be used to identify thermal refugia, extent of cold-water trout habitat to adjust stocking densities, and adapt management strategies in the face of climate change. || Stream thermal regimes vary based on geography, geomorphology, and hydrology, and are usually defined as <i>cold, cool, and warm</i> depending on what temperature metrics are used (i.e., daily mean temperature, monthly mean, maximum daily mean, or range of variability).

Mule deer in Oklahoma are near the southeastern extent of the species' range; thus, their distribution is limited and densities are presumably low. Mule deer populations in Oklahoma are restricted currently to areas that are typically characterized by extreme weather events, high variability in resource availability, and an increasing influence of anthropogenic activities associated with agricultural operations and energy infrastructure. In Oklahoma, data are limited to annual harvest numbers, and mule deer are hunted and managed under white-tailed deer (<i>O. virginianus</i>) regulations. To better understand the distribution, abundance, and population ecology of mule deer and to inform harvest management in western Oklahoma, we are proposing a comprehensive research project. We will assess methods for investigating and monitoring mule deer distribution and spatial variation in abundance. We will estimate survival and factors influencing mortality in adult females and fawns, and we will obtain estimates of fecundity and recruitment. We will investigate movements and habitat selection in the context of the potential effects of anthropogenic pressures (including agriculture and energy infrastructure) and environmental variability. Additionally, we will leverage mule deer data in the Texas Panhandle to evaluate movement ecology and population dynamics at an interstate scale. This research will assist Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation (ODWC) in managing mule deer by providing data to support decision-making on monitoring, harvest, and habitat management. || Recent apparent population declines across mule deer (<i>Odocoileus hemionus</i>) range in the American West are of interest to biologists and managers. Mule deer in Oklahoma are near the southeastern extent of the species' range; thus, their distribution is limited and densities are presumably low. Mule deer populations in Oklahoma are restricted currently to areas that are typically characterized by extreme weather events, high variability in resource availability, and an increasing influence of anthropogenic activities associated with agricultural operations and energy infrastructure. In Oklahoma, data are limited to annual harvest numbers, and mule deer are hunted and managed under white-tailed deer (<i>O. virginianus</i>) regulations. To better understand the distribution, abundance, and population ecology of mule deer and to inform harvest management in western Oklahoma, we are proposing a comprehensive research project. We will assess methods for investigating and monitoring mule deer distribution and spatial variation in abundance. We will estimate survival and factors influencing mortality in adult females and fawns, and we will obtain estimates of fecundity and recruitment.

Accordingly, American Shad are particularly sensitive habitat fragmentation resulting from dam construction that block migratory pathways and are also being threatened by overfishing, flow alteration, and habitat loss. Due to these threats, the American Shad has been listed as a species of high conservation need on SCDNR's State Wildlife Action Plan. Historically, anadromous species used much of the Broad River, but dams have since blocked upstream migration, resulting in the loss of spawning habitat for many species. In 2007, the construction of fish ladder at the Columbia Diversion Dam open access to 24 miles of potential spawning habitat for anadromous species, and species like the American Shad are passing through the fish ladder in increasing numbers. However, it is still unknown if or where spawning occurs between Columbia Diversion Dam and Parr Hydroelectric Dam (SCDNR personal communication). Therefore, this project aims to determine whether American Shad are spawning in this river section as well as identify potential spawning habitat sites. Site-specific information on spawning sites and larval fish habitat requirements are needed to better understand how larval and adult fish American Shad will respond to habitat alteration and provide manager with information needed to protect key spawning and nursery habitats. Additionally, environmental cues driving migration and spawning of shad are not well understood. Temperature and instream flow variation are thought to be the main factors driving American Shad spawning, migration, and recruitment. This project will also explore the effects of variation in temperature and river discharge on recruitment spawning and adult migration upstream. || The objectives of this project are to: 1) identify the temporal patterns of egg and larval fish abundance of the fish community to better understand when fish populations may be most sensitive to environmental disturbance such as large water releases; 2) determine if American Shad are spawning between the Columbia Canal Diversion Dam and Parr Reservoir; 3) identify potential spawning and nursery habitats for American Shad; 4) quantify the temporal pattern of the larval fish community in the lower Broad River. This project will deliver crucial information on spawning and migration activity of American Shad in the lower Broad River. Additionally, this project will provide managers with a better understand of temporal patterns of larval fish and the environmental variables driving these patterns in the lower Broad River. The results of this project will also allow managers to more effectively evaluate the potential benefits of the Columbia Fishway for American Shad and the impacts of different discharge regimes and environmental alteration on fish populations. | | |[ Mapping wildlife road crossing hotspots ](/coopunits/project/275290972160/crmorrow) | August 2025 || Wildlife presents a significant and grave safety hazard on roadways.

Additionally, the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (WVDNR) is interested in obtaining more information on turkey hunter effort and satisfaction, which will be combined with biological data to ensure that management decisions continue to reflect the needs of the state.

In empirical studies, I combine techniques in wildlife ecology with the social sciences. In this series of projects funded by California DFW investigating the socio-ecology of coyote-sheep conflict, I showed that participatory maps improved ecological models of risk and addressed previously unreported issues of selection bias. In a subsequent study I co-led, we combined rancher interviews with an ecological experiment to show that the level of trust ranchers have for managers and scientists plays an important role in their interpretation of scientific data. In both of these studies, I shared findings in stakeholder workshops and through popular media. When this research was put into practice by ranchers, they witnessed dramatic declines in livestock predation. Simultaneously, California DFW has used our research to guide stakeholder engagement and conflict mitigation efforts. Stakeholder workshops provided novel insights into the ecological drivers of conflict, and, in research I co-led, these insights led to a novel framework and a highly cited publication that has improved conflict prediction and mitigation.<b><br></b> || This research focuses on understanding how human risk perceptions and social trust influence human-wildlife conflict.

The U.S. has adopted early detection and rapid response (EDRR) policies to prevent spread and establishment of invasive species, but implementing a consistent, national-scale EDRR approach has been stymied due to difficulties in (i) accurately predicting where and when invasive species will spread and (ii) consistently estimating invasive species' impacts on ecosystem services. To overcome these difficulties, our project's overall goal is to develop and implement a consistent, national-scale EDRR tool that can be adapted to most terrestrial invasive plants. To achieve this goal, we will 1) develop novel early detection methods that predict invasive species' spread and overcome key modeling limitations, 2) implement our early detection methods on the model system of cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica), one of the \"world's worst weeds\" and current invader in the U.S., 3) estimate cogongrass impacts on ecosystem services across a gradient of invasion, and 4) use early detection model predictions to map losses in ecosystem services driven by cogongrass invasion under different climate change scenarios, and 5) publish computer code and instructional vignettes to facilitate our EDRR tool's application for other terrestrial invasive plant species. By synergizing early detection models and ecosystem service impacts, our products will empower stakeholders and private landowners to prioritize proactive management actions at local, regional, and national scales and maximally conserve ecosystem services like biodiversity, timber, and livestock production. || Globally, invasive species cause trillions of dollars in damages to ecosystem services, including agricultural production and biodiversity, and these damages will only increase as climate change progresses.

This has spurred the development of statewide decision support tools, such as habitat suitability models and population density maps, to assist in strategizing large-scale turkey conservation. However, these tools can run afoul of multiple complications: traditional habitat suitability models can oversimplify the diversity of turkey-habitat associations; density maps often provide little new information relative to habitat suitability maps; and neither of these tools account for the reality that conservation decisions are made in the face of complex socio-ecological landscapes, diverse and sometimes competing stakeholders, and limited funds. Therefore, there is a <i><u>critical need</u></i> to develop a decision support tool for Arkansas that 1) incorporates spatial non-stationarity into turkey habitat suitability analyses, 2) provides independent, spatially explicit information on turkey population growth rates, and 3) synthesizes turkey habitat suitability, turkey population growth rates, and relevant external socio-ecological information to identify areas where management actions will be most impactful and cost-efficient. Here, our overall goal is to develop and implement a decision support tool that informs wild turkey conservation and management strategies across Arkansas. Specifically, our objectives are: 1) Identify and map important turkey habitat across Arkansas using models that incorporate spatially non-stationary habitat relationships; 2) Estimate and map population growth rates of turkeys across Arkansas; 3) Using information from objectives 1 - 2, identify areas with the greatest potential to positively impact turkey populations through management; 4) Provide technical assistance for development of public-facing data products. The models, data products, and technical assistance we provide will put Arkansas Game & Fish Commission in an ideal position to prevent, halt, or potentially reverse turkey declines in Arkansas. || The apparent declines in wild turkey (<i>Meleagris gallopavo</i>) populations has led to growing concern in multiple states, and Arkansas is no exception.

Lethal control is often used to regulate beaver activity in areas experiencing negative impacts (e.g., to private property, infrastructure; Parker and Rosell 2003) but public interests in non-lethal approaches is growing. Recent literature suggests that water control structures, if installed and managed correctly, can reduce damage while keeping beavers resident. In areas heavily populated by humans, controlling water flow while keeping beavers resident (as opposed to exporting the flooding problem to another locale) is a desirable management outcome. In collaboration with partners from USDA Wildlife Services, we are radio-tracking beavers at locations where water-control structures are being installed to evaluate how to most effectively install and maintain flow structures while keeping beavers resident. || American beavers <i>(Castor canadensis) </i>are broadly distributed throughout the Great Lakes region, and their tendency to alter water flow through dam building has positive and negative consequences (Taylor and Singleton 2014).

The sprigs of greenery are often replenished or replaced daily during incubation and nestling rearing periods. The potential implications of this behavior are not trivial, as the behavior would not have developed if it did not serve an important ecological function. I propose that the addition of greenery to nests has a combined function of 1) increasing humidity and 2) decreasing temperature within the immediate environment of the nest. High temperature and low humidity have been demonstrated to negatively influence nesting success of raptors, and raptors have few mechanisms to cool eggs or nestlings. Further, nestling raptors thermoregulate by gular flutter, which is functionally evaporative cooling; this behavior, however, is conducted at the expense of losing body moisture which can only be replaced via food while in the nestling stage. In a pilot test with replica nests, the effect of adding greenery was rapid and dramatic, influencing the nest humidity for 13 hrs and temperature for 9 hrs, with maximum treatment differences of 64% increased humidity and 7% decreased temperature. In this study, an undergraduate fellow will 1) validate preliminary findings through replication and increase in sample size; 2) test leaf material from multiple tree species to assess species-specific differences in effect on humidity and temperature; 3) conduct observations of Mississippi kites to determine what tree species they select for green material and if, based on our tests, they select those species that provide the greatest influence on humidity and temperature. || Many raptor species (i.e., hawks, eagles) will place green plant material on their nests, not as part of the nest structure, but added to the top perimeter of the nest.

Texas Parks and Wildlife Department lists the owls as threatened and a S1B species, indicating it is critically imperiled in the state because of extreme rarity or other factors. Currently, the species' known distribution in Texas is based primarily on a few documented observations at isolated locations in the Davis Mountains and the Guadalupe Mountains. No focused effort has been made to assess the true distribution and habitat associations of Mexican spotted owls in Texas. The primarily privately owned and rugged landscapes with habitat suitable for the species, and the fact that conventional surveys must be done at night and are time consuming (i.e., expensive), have rendered conventional surveys very challenging in the Trans Pecos region. We are initiating a study to assess the distribution of Mexican spotted owls in Texas by using passive audio monitors (PAMs) to sample the nocturnal hours for Mexican spotted owl vocalizations on public and private properties in the Trans Pecos allowing wildlife researchers to access to their properties. Owls announce their presence and breeding territories by species-specific, identifiable, vocalizations at night. Each PAM will be programmed to record during the Mexican spotted owl breeding season (~February - April). Each PAM will then be retrieved, data downloaded and analyzed for detections of Mexican spotted owls. Our final product will help address knowledge gaps for the Mexican spotted owl distributions in Texas and serve to facilitate informed listing, conservation, and management planning, and serve to guide future research on the species. || The Mexican spotted owl (<i>Stix occidentalis lucida</i>) is protected as a threatened species under the federal Endangered Species Act, and the species is distributed irregularly due to the patchy distribution of its habitat.

Due to substantial reduction in distribution and suspected population declines, the species has been petitioned for federal protection under the Endangered Species Act and is ranked as a G2 - imperiled (global ranking) and S1 - critically imperiled (state ranking) species. We propose a study addressing three important steps in the effort to conserve the species. First is to conduct experimental vegetation manipulations to determine feasibility and effectiveness of restoring, enhancing, or creating usable habitat for Texas kangaroo rats. Second is to assess movement patterns and dispersal of Texas kangaroo rats, especially the success of getting dispersal of individuals into restored areas from proximal occupied areas. Third is to model connectivity and environmental resistance to dispersal of Texas kangaroo rats within and among the known occupied clusters; such a model would allow targeted application of habitat restoration or creation. This project has been in a 'pilot status' due to delays in funding and obtaining access to private lands.

In recent decades, these populations have increased and expanded in size and range due to collaborative conservation efforts and protections under the Endangered Species Act. Today, population estimates exceed 1000 animals each in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE) and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). The Selkirk Ecosystem (SE) has approximately 50 grizzly bears, and augmentations into the Cabinet-Yaak Ecosystem (CYE) helped boost the population to an estimated 50 - 60 animals. To date, the Bitterroot (BE) and North Cascades Ecosystems (NCE) lack any known permanent residents.<br><br>Eventual connectivity between populations is a conservation goal, as is establishment of populations in currently unoccupied recovery areas. An understanding of habitat selection by grizzly bears within existing populations is crucial for predicting potential linkage zones and suitable habitat. A second urgent conservation challenge is identification of areas where grizzly bears are likely to disperse among recovery ecosystems, and proactive efforts to reduce human-grizzly bear conflicts. Our overall objective in this study was therefore to model grizzly bear movement, habitat use, and population connectivity to identify specific areas that are important for habitat use and natural connectivity among recovery ecosystems. We developed a multi-phase approach to accomplish these goals.<br><br>In phase 1, we aimed to increase understanding of how males and females use habitat within the NCDE. We employed multiple stages to test hypotheses of behavior, use newly gained knowledge to mechanistically simulate individual movements, translate results to predictive habitat maps, and test their predictive power across a large scale. Mechanistically modeling grizzly bear movements using integrated step selection functions (iSSFs) for GPS-collared grizzly bears (F = 46, M = 19) demonstrated that grizzly bears have highly individualistic spatial behaviors. Some individuals avoided whereas others preferred areas of vegetation green-up, terrain ruggedness, forest edge, riparian areas, building densities, and secure habitat. Such individualism supported the need for an individual-based modeling approach to understand and predict grizzly bear behavior. External validation demonstrated high predictive accuracy with mean Spearman rank scores of >0.90 across seasons and years, and overall scores of 1.0. The top 5 classes of our predictive habitat maps contained 73.5% of female fixes and 83.6% of male fixes, and the top class (comprising 10% of the mapped area) contained 25.6% and 41.7% of female and male fixes, respectively. Results of this phase of our research provide tools for conservation planning and served as the basis for sequential phases of our research.<br><br>In phase 2, we tested whether our iSSFs developed for NCDE bears in phase 1 were transferable to the SE, CYE, and GYE. We simulated 100 replicates of 5,000 steps for each iSSF in each ecosystem, summarized relative use into 10 equal-area classes for each sex, and overlaid GPS locations from bears in the SE, CYE, and GYE on resulting maps. Spearman rank correlations between numbers of locations and class rank were 0.96 within each study area, indicating models were highly predictive of grizzly bear space use in these nearby populations. Assessment of models using smaller subsets of data in space and time demonstrated generally high predictive accuracy for females. Although mostly high across space and time, predictive accuracy for males was low within some watersheds and in summer within the SE and CYE, potentially due to seasonal effects, vegetation, and food assemblage differences. Altogether, these phase 2 results demonstrated high transferability of our models to landscapes in the Northern Rocky Mountains, suggesting they may be used to evaluate habitat suitability and connectivity throughout the region to benefit conservation planning.<br><br>In phase 3, we simulated connectivity pathways for grizzly bears between recovery ecosystems in the Northern Rockies. Building on phases 1 and 2, we modeled movements to identify potential pathways for dispersal, using the iSSFs developed in phase 1. We applied the models in a >300,000 km2 area including the NCDE, CYE, GYE, and BE. First, we simulated directed movements (randomized shortest paths with 3 levels of exploration) between start and end nodes for routes between populations. Second, we simulated undirected movements from start nodes in the NCDE, CYE, or GYE (no predetermined end nodes). We summarized and binned results as classes 1 (lowest relative predicted use) - 10 (highest relative predicted use) and evaluated predictions using 127 outlier grizzly bear locations. Values at outlier locations indicated good model fit and mean classes at outlier locations (7.4) and Spearman rank correlations (0.87) were highest for undirected simulations and directed simulations with the highest level of exploration. Our resulting predictive maps will facilitate on-the-ground application of this research for prioritizing habitat conservation, human-bear conflict mitigation, and transportation planning. Additionally, our overall modeling approach has direct utility for myriad species and conservation applications.<br><br>Additional phases of this work are ongoing. || Over the past two centuries, persecution and habitat loss caused grizzly bears (<i>Ursus arctos</i>) to decline from a population of approximately 50,000 individuals to only 4 fragmented populations within the continental United States.

A decision support tool is a set of ideas, maps, concepts, data, or computer programs that managers and other practitioners can use to make decisions within their agencies. However, existing decision support tools may not be relevant or effective if they are misaligned with agency priorities, if they conflict with operational constraints, or if they do not mesh with actions that managers have available. The overarching question we address here is \"<i>What decision support tools (characteristics, examples) will narrow the existing knowledge-action gap and create effective and relevant actionable science for the state and federal fisheries managers who are charged with conserving prairie stream biota in the face of climate change impacts?</i>\"<br><br><b><i> Closing \"Knowledge-Action\" Gaps to Implement Actionable Science.</i></b><b> </b>The project we propose here merges the expertise of researchers (ecological and social science) and state and federal fisheries managers (practical experience with day-to-day realities) to close the \"knowledge-action\" gap for conservation of native prairie stream biota. Researchers and managers think differently about actionable science because they have different job responsibilities, work within institutions that have different missions, and may experience different \"work cultures.\" Managers do an excellent job on their day-to-day tasks, but with their ever expanding job responsibilities, they don't always have time to strategically think about what is needed to successfully navigate the future. Researchers have excellent ideas, but their substantial expertise does not always mesh with management priorities at the appropriate scale for decision making.

Over 700 federal reservoirs are operated by the Army Corps of Engineers, making them critically important landscapes for the Department of Defense. Managing reservoir fish for recreational angling is a primary responsibility for state agencies. In addition, the connection between the lacustrine component of reservoirs and associated inflow-outflow rivers can have positive and negative effects on fish communities, including at risk species. At present, reservoir ecosystems are difficult to understand and manage because of their size, heterogeneity, ecological complexity, land-water link and multiple use objectives. Reservoirs also face increasing threats from aging, invasives, climate change, fish habitat loss, sediment accumulation, adjacent land use, eutrophication, harmful algae, and other adverse impacts. Although reservoirs have many disciplinary and policy components, their role in recreational fishing, swimming, and recreational boating are major foci for local partnerships of state and federal agency professionals and the general public. Identifying ways to address future change is daunting, but strategic rethinking about managing present and future threats can yield substantial benefits. <br> <br>Much literature and many datasets exist that describe reservoir fish populations, water quality/quantity, watershed land use, habitat, and stream fish communities. However, this literature and these datasets often are not integrated. Consequently, much useful information that could help manage reservoirs is underused because of this lack of synthesis. A guide for quantitative synthesis would benefit all fisheries professionals interested in managing reservoir fish and the associated angling communities. Most state agency employees, charged with managing reservoir fish and reservoir fish habitat, have a full plate of responsibilities. Thus, asking agencies alone to take on new challenges is not realistic. However, a number of university researchers have a strong interest in helping to provide science that guides management.

However, attempts to verify eDNA results via live-fish collection have seen limited success due in part to limited understanding life-stage specific habitat use within prairie systems and the sampling methods to collect individuals effectively among different habitat types. Therefore, the study objectives of this project are to: (1) investigate sampling methods (i.e., towed trawls, various net configurations, and different electrofishing methods, etc.) that can effectively sample the invasive carp population, and (2) devise a sampling protocol for use in prairie systems that can target different life-stages of invasive carp populations. Such a protocol can be used to inform information gaps based on desired management objectives including documenting presence, assessing demographic rates, and/or eradication efforts. We will employ multiple gear-types including trawls, nets, and tow-barge electrofishing. Sampling efforts will occur spring, summer, and fall starting in 2023 and continuing into 2024.

We will use information from eDNA results to direct sampling to locations with both positive and negative results for presence of invasive carp. Lower reaches of these systems may be accessible by boats using traditional sampling gears. We will sample river and stream reaches higher in the watersheds where traditional methods are not easily employed. || Currently, eDNA is being used to investigate the distribution of invasive carp among lotic systems in Nebraska. However, attempts to verify eDNA results via live-fish collection have seen limited success due in part to limited understanding life-stage specific habitat use within prairie systems and the sampling methods to collect individuals effectively among different habitat types. Therefore, the study objectives of this project are to: (1) investigate sampling methods (i.e., towed trawls, various net configurations, and different electrofishing methods, etc.) that can effectively sample the invasive carp population, and (2) devise a sampling protocol for use in prairie systems that can target different life-stages of invasive carp populations. Such a protocol can be used to inform information gaps based on desired management objectives including documenting presence, assessing demographic rates, and/or eradication efforts. We will employ multiple gear-types including trawls, nets, and tow-barge electrofishing. Sampling efforts will occur spring, summer, and fall starting in 2023 and continuing into 2024. We will focus sampling efforts in mid-order prairie streams and rivers that are tributaries to the Missouri River and the Platte River in Nebraska. Streams and systems may include the Blue River, Nemaha Rivers, and Papillion Creek, along the Missouri River. Streams and systems may include the Salt Creek, Elkhorn River, Shell Creek, and Loup River along the Platte River.

However, in-person conferences have significant barriers to access and inclusion, often excluding scientists and institutions with less financial resources and individuals for whom long-distance travel is difficult. The shift to virtual conferences during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated these historical barriers, as conferences were attended by more diverse groups of scientists. This research investigates how and whether virtual and hybrid conferences in ecology, environmental science, and allied fields have increased participation by individuals from a diverse set of institutions, including academic organizations like universities and organizations outside of academia like government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and environmental consulting firms. By focusing on increasing institutional diversity, scientific conferences can improve collaboration and knowledge exchange between academic and extra-academic scientists, facilitating evidence-based environmental management. The project will also assess whether virtual and hybrid conferences are more inclusive of a diverse set of backgrounds and career stages and assess barriers, attitudes, and preferences related to conference access, attendance and participation. Lastly, researchers will identify future and alternative virtual and hybrid formats and features likely to best support members from diverse institutions and backgrounds. Short-term outcomes will include guidance for professional societies to develop equitable and inclusive conferences and overcome barriers to access; long-term outcomes will be increased visibility and awareness of a diversity of types of institutions in ecology and conservation communities. || In-person conference formats can exclude many scientists and environmental practitioners who can contribute to and benefit from the exchange of ideas and research that takes place at these events, including those from low-to-middle income countries, early career-researchers, student trainees, caregivers, and those from non-research-intensive institutions. In particular, limited knowledge sharing and exchange between academic and extra-academic audiences have stymied integration of research into management and environmental policies. This project will provide professional societies and individual scientists with evidence-based guidance to evaluate tradeoffs in access, participation, and conference experience, to design more equitable conferences that can increase knowledge exchange across institutional boundaries. Through a focus on integration of academic and extra-academic scientists from a diverse range of institutions, this work will also support student and early-career researchers in their need and desire for development toward extra-academic career paths. This project applies quantitative and semi-quantitative approaches to assess if virtual conferences facilitate access for individuals from more diverse institutions, logistical and cultural factors that can expand access, and conference features and formats that are most likely to support inclusion of student and early-career researchers from those institutions. We will accomplish this through analysis of conference attendance prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, surveys of current and prospective members of participating professional societies, and focus groups that iteratively identify approaches for testing as part of a future project. This project will produce multiple peer-reviewed publications, presentations, and an educational webinar. | | |[ Development of new eDNA tools to detect aquatic invasive plants in Upper Mississippi River Basin ](/coopunits/project/261572554752/lwaterhouse) | December 2026 || We will develop portable and rapid environmental DNA multispecies sequencing protocols (using the Nanopore MinION device) for detecting invasive aquatic plants through water samples.

In an effort to further bolster bighorn sheep across the state, the WGFD and partners have conducted numerous large-scale research and survey projects occurring both statewide and across broad regions. For example, since 2011 the WGFD and its Wildlife Health Laboratory have been conducting statewide bighorn sheep herd health surveillance and have sampled over 1,500 bighorn sheep across the state, many of which were also equipped with GPS collars. Additionally, collaborative efforts within the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) involving the WGFD, Montana State University, the University of Wyoming, the National Park Service, and the Shoshone and Arapaho Tribes have worked to conduct an integrated research program focused on bighorn sheep pathogen communities, habitat selection, seasonal migration, competition with introduced mountain goats, and genetics. Collaborators involved in this work have aggregated upwards of two million dollars for research that has compiled one of the largest integrated datasets ever collected for bighorn sheep. The research efforts have helped to directly inform bighorn sheep management and conservation, have been presented at local and national conferences, and produced nearly 20 peer-reviewed journal articles covering a broad range of topics. While past efforts have greatly helped to further our understanding of bighorn sheep across the state, there are a host of additional research projects that can use the existing datasets to generate new insights and further advance bighorn sheep management and conservation.

Our flow-based classification is an important step that addresses a MDC strategic action: Support the creation of a statewide framework for ecological limits of hydrologic alteration based on aquatic community classification by the end of FY23. The goal of this project is to provide the scientific foundation for ecological flow assessments to inform internal decision making and enhance the Department's ability to advocate for water resources within the context of interagency efforts on site-specific projects or any future partner initiated effort to establish environmental flow standards. | | |[ Quantifying the impacts of climate change on fish growth and production to enable sustainable management of diverse inland fisheries ](/coopunits/project/255919689728/cpaukert) | December 2023 || Climate change is altering all aspects of freshwaters, with important implications for managed fisheries. Both individual growth and population production are fundamental metrics for designing and evaluating effective regulations. We propose to quantify changes in fish thermal habitat conditions, growth, and production for multiple managed species encompassing a range of thermal preferences in Midwestern lentic systems ranging from the Laurentian Great Lakes to inland glacial lakes (e.g., MI, MN, WI) to large reservoirs (e.g., MO, AR). Focal species will include coolwater walleye, warmwater largemouth bass, and 2-4 additional species identified based on agency priorities and data availability. We will quantify the relationship between temperature and growth using statistical models of length and will use bioenergetics models to estimate whether growth and consumption will change under future temperature conditions. Results of this analysis will be used to inform managers about the effectiveness of length-based regulations under changing climates. The data, tools, and results of this project will be co-produced with state agency personnel and disseminated via several mechanisms, including state-specific webinars, extension of an existing data visualization tool, and direct liaison with management agencies through our project team. Our project team consists of leading fisheries scientists, including representatives from fisheries management agencies throughout the Midwest. We will engage additional partners in the state fisheries management agencies of Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin, to identify relevant metrics related to thermal habitat, growth and production; co-produce communication tools; and to obtain necessary data and incorporate input into final products || Climate change is altering all aspects of freshwaters, with important implications for managed fisheries.

Many agencies compile data from recreational anglers because recreational fishing has great social and ecological importance in the U.S. In 2020 alone, more than 42 million people participated in freshwater fishing. However, climate change may affect the numbers, sizes, and species of fish available to anglers. Agencies tasked with managing fisheries often keep records of angler catch and harvest to better manage fisheries. Existing tools can be used to determine how fish species important to anglers may change in growth or abundance, which may dictate if anglers even pursue these species in the future. Our proposed work will use existing data in the \"CreelCat\" and \"FiCli\" databases coupled with ongoing studies to relate regionwide trends in angler effort, catch, and harvest to environmental metrics. This work can help inform management strategies for predicted fish and angler behavior in a changing climate. || Existing data sets are valuable because they typically encompass more data (spatially and temporally) that can be collected by a specific research/monitoring effort. For fish and recreational fisheries data, efforts to integrate across datasets to inform management are limited. Despite the implementation of angler and fish surveys and their importance to fisheries management at state scales, regional, and national coordination among these activities is minimal, limiting data applicability to larger-scale management practices and research, particularly as fish and anglers adapt to a changing climate. We will maintain and further develop the U.S. Inland Creel and Angler Survey Catalog (CreelCat) and the Fish and Climate Change database (FiCli) to highlight applications of using both databases to inform management, particularly climate adaptation. CreelCat and FiCli are publicly available databases that establish a baseline of national inland recreational fishing metrics and provide summary information on climate effect on fish and management actions, respectively. We will use these databases to ask how catch and harvest vary regionally, how angler social dynamics may be linked to fish population information (e.g., growth rates) as some anglers may target larger fish found in systems with fast growth rates, and how climate change may affect he social and ecological dynamics of recreational fisheries. Although these tools are useful individually, integrating them with ongoing CASC-funded research of fish growth and consumption, will drive a suite of modeling efforts to predict inland recreational anglers' responses to global environmental change. | | |[ Identifying effects of weather and land use on autumn and winter waterfowl distribution dynamics in the 21st century ](/coopunits/project/255694548992/webbli) | June 2023 || Waterfowl are of substantial economic and cultural importance, with over 1 million hunters contributing approximately $700 million in total expenditures to local and regional economies annually.

These conditions in the broader landscape may influence the functional connectivity and impede the ability of wild ungulates to cope with changes in habitat and forage conditions associated with changing climatic conditions, and anthropogenic activities, which may ultimately compromise sustainability of many big game populations. Adaptive movements by non-migratory populations allow animals to efficiently exploit dynamic nutritional landscape. These movements are critical for migratory and non-migratory populations alike as they allow them to maximize nutritional gain, enhance survival and recruitment, and increase probability of population persistence. This will be especially important for populations in arid and semi-arid regions that are predicted to become hotter and drier under various climate change models. Pronghorn in the arid Southwest are generally nomadic rather than seasonal migrants. However, impediments to movements that allow pronghorn to track changing forage conditions in an arid landscape are equally important for population persistence as migration routes are to truly migratory populations in more north temperate regions. This project will monitor pronghorn movements in southwestern New Mexico for a period of 2-3 years. The goals are to monitor space use and movements, identify impediments or barriers to movement that can be targeted by management agencies for remediation, and assess habitat use patterns to determine habitat utilization, with a particular emphasis on vegetation restoration treatments implemented by BLM. || The landscapes necessary to maintain large mammal movements are becoming increasingly fragmented across the western United States due to anthropogenic factors. These conditions in the broader landscape may influence the functional connectivity and impede the ability of wild ungulates to cope with changes in habitat and forage conditions associated with changing climatic conditions, and anthropogenic activities, which may ultimately compromise sustainability of many big game populations. Funding provided to state and federal agencies from Secretarial Order 3362 (Improving Habitat Quality in Western Big Game Winter Range and Migration Corridors) has contributed to substantial efforts to identify, map and monitor big game migration routes across the western United States. Yet many big game populations are non-migratory, characterized by resident or nomadic movement strategies. These resident and nomadic populations characterize the majority of mule deer and pronghorn populations across the lower elevation and more arid portions of the southwestern U.S. Mapping efforts for these populations are largely not covered by funding from Secretarial Order 3362, resulting in a gap in the knowledge of animal movements and distribution needed to make informed land management decisions.

Here, we propose to run a series of validation experiments to better understand how the environment and acoustic interference (e.g., from wind or heterospecific birds) influences the ability of NRT acoustic recorders to detect the vocalizations of two TES bird species present on Phakuloa Training Area, HI (PTA). Results from this demonstration will improve the ability to use NRT acoustic recorders and inform our understanding of their limitations and approaches to circumvent those limitations. | | |[ WildSNaP: Biodiversity in Solar through Native Planting ](/coopunits/project/250483947520/cproberts) | July 2026 || Renewable energy production is exponentially increasing worldwide to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. Solar energy has rapidly expanded across the US landscape to meet the population's growing energy needs, with a projected increase of solar energy contribution from 3% of total electricity generation in 2020 to 20% in 2050. Solar production in the US is estimated to have increased by 33.2% just in the last year. Production of small-scale residential and commercial solar arrays has increased, but the largest contribution of solar energy growth now comes from utility-scale solar arrays. These arrays are frequently built in agricultural fields or croplands, because the flat open landscape maximizes efficiency of solar power generation and minimizes site preparation activities. There has been a recent movement to plant low-growing native plant communities under solar arrays to reduce the costs associated with turf grass mowing. We are evaluating how the bird, amphibian, pollinator, bat, and mammal communities use solar arrays with an understory of native grasses and forbs compared to sites with turf grass as well as reference sites. || Renewable energy production is exponentially increasing worldwide to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Florida invests heavily in aquatic plant control, with state and federal agencies spending over $20 million annually on management. Most aquatic plant management efforts in the state involve herbicide application, with a primary focus on hydrilla, water hyacinth, and water lettuce. Although these three species are classified as invasive and have been present in Florida for decades, research on their impacts has yielded inconsistent results. There is a critical need to better characterize effects of invasive plants and their management on aquatic ecosystems in Florida. To this end, our objectives are to evaluate (1) the direct impacts of invasive plant management on plant species abundances and (2) the indirect impacts of invasive plant management on Largemouth Bass populations through changes in plant abundances after curating a master dataset composed of long-term data collected by various agencies across Florida. || Aquatic plant management is critical for maintaining open waterways for navigation and recreation, reducing mosquito-borne diseases, and protecting freshwater ecosystems.

The complexity of causal mechanisms that link humans to wildlife make it difficult to understand and predict effects of management and conservation actions. To make progress, we will couple large data sets with sophisticated statistical models. Data come from motion-sensing trail cameras (n = 250 sites) deployed from 2019-2022 across gradients of human disturbance, including logging, fires, road density, and human presence. We will develop structural equation models, generalized additive models, and mixed effects models to link image data to objectives. Our first objective is to assess the effects of human disturbance on mule deer (<i>Odocoileus hemionus</i>)<i> </i>daily activity patterns and quantify whether the response alters mule deer exposure to predator and competitor species. Our second objective is to quantify the cumulative effects of landscape disturbance and human presence on the occurrence of mule deer, including both direct and indirect effects. Our third objective is to quantify the influence of human disturbance on species richness in the Southern Interior British Columbia mammal community.

The PIs met with stakeholders in summer 2022 to begin the process of obtaining colony data and focusing the atlas effort. || The coastal zone of the northern Gulf also supports a diverse array of breeding nearshore seabirds most of which are colonial and nest on islands, marshes, mainland beaches, or human-made structures. Although nest-site fidelity is common among seabirds, the dynamic nature of the coastal zone in the northern Gulf can result in inter-annual shifts in the locations of colonies and in the existence, size, or stability of the islands or habitats that support them. Overlaid on this dynamic system is a stakeholder network responsible for management of these species and their breeding habitats that includes natural resource agencies from five states, multiple federal agencies (e.g., USFWS, NPS, BLM, DOD, ACOE), and numerous private organizations (e.g., National Audubon Society, Nature Conservancy). In an effort to coordinate and facilitate the management and conservation of avian taxa throughout this wide range of habitats and across this complex network of stakeholders in the northern Gulf, the Gulf of Mexico Avian Monitoring Network (GoMAMN) recently released strategic monitoring guidelines that highlighted the need for a spatial inventory of breeding sites of seabirds in the region. The development of this Atlas will build from efforts by the Gulf Coast Joint Venture's Bird Nesting Island Cooperative, and it's \"Atlas\" Team. Stakeholders from each Gulf state and from regional NGOs will also be participating. The Atlas will support inventory, monitoring, management, disaster response, and research. The atlas and register also will be valuable for marine spatial planning issues, including but not limited to sighting wind turbines, scheduling and siting sand-dredging and beach nourishment operations, managing recreation and access, and land/marine conservation planning. | | |[ Deer behavioral and population responses to fire, hunting, and predation ](/coopunits/project/243689033728/mmcinturff) | December 2023 || As global changes continue to intensify in severity and frequency, it is essential to understand not just their effects on the environment, but also their broader effects on social-ecological systems.

Successful conservation therefore requires coordination, which in turn requires a governance structure or framework that partners can agree to and work within to accomplish shared goals. To date, SECAS has helped provide an overarching vision for landscape conservation in the Southeast. However, SECAS was organized around Landscape Conservation Collaboratives that are now disassembling or transitioning to new arrangements. As such, SECAS partners are interested in learning about governance structures being utilized by other efforts across the country to help inform future conversations about how to best facilitate meaningful interaction between state, federal, NGO, and private sector partners.<br> This Scope of Work will begin to address that need by examining the characteristics and performance of existing landscape conservation initiative governance structures and providing recommendations for landscape conservation practitioners and the research community based on the results of that research and analysis.

To help land managers make effective resource decisions and to better understand the role of beaver in prairie systems, we plan to measure the role of natural and artificial beaver ponds (e.g., beaver dam analogs) in insect product and local bat activity. | | |[ The Next Frontier: D&E Tools to estimate density via cameras to examine population impacts of CWD/Effects of Management ](/coopunits/project/243621455872/dwalsh) | June 2023 || We will jointly develop a novel Bayesian model-based estimator using a time-to-event framework based on the inter-arrival times of individuals in remote camera images (Kalbfleisch and Prentice, 1980). We will evaluate this model and compare it to the design-based models (Moeller et al. 2018) using computer simulations, and determine what method is superior. Next, we will examine how camera deployment affects the performance of the estimators (e.g., placement and spacing of cameras, time-lapse vs. motion-activated, number of cameras needed, etc.) also using computer simulation studies. From these results, we will develop guidelines for designing remote camera grids for estimating deer density. We will use machine-learning techniques (Tabak et al. 2020) to classify deer from camera imagery collected from the Midwest CWD-affected regions. Using this classified imagery, we will apply the appropriate statistical models, based on our simulation studies, to estimate deer density.

Our project collaborators will develop a decision framework for weighing tradeoffs among potential management actions and the anticipated effects of those actions. This funding will provide support for a year of graduate student funding for performing the CCVA and predicting which amphibian species in the region are most at risk from climate change. || To make informed decisions, wildlife managers need to identify species facing the greatest threats and effective management actions to address those threats. Amphibians are a group of animals facing especially severe declines due to many factors including climate change. Although some amphibian species are relatively well-studied, most are not because suitable data are lacking; therefore, tools to assist management decisions must be applicable to species across a range of data availability and susceptibility to climate change. | | |[ US FWS-UM Collaboration to Support Native American Graduate Students in Wildlife Biology ](/coopunits/project/243619080192/Mike.Mitchell) | July 2024 || We propose to admit and mentor three Native American graduate students at the M.S. level in our Wildlife Biology Program at UM.

The species' distribution has been restricted to approximately 50% of its historic sites, and local population declines have been observed from Nova Scotia to Georgia. Identified threats include decreased habitat and water quality associated with shoreline and watershed development, habitat fragmentation caused by dams and stream crossings, and potential stochastic events associated with a changing climate. This species has been identified by Northeastern states as one of the most critically imperiled species in the region and was one of the few mussel species identified as \"At-Risk\" by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 2021. A range wide, collaborative approach to conservation is needed to reverse the trend of habitat loss and reduce the risk of local and regional extirpations.

Eradicating invasive species is notoriously difficult; therefore, preventing their introduction is critical to control their spread. Many invasive species originate via trade and commerce, such as through the ballast water of shipping vessels or through the food trade. Enabling invasive species surveillance at discrete points of entry is a promising avenue to detecting and preventing new invasions before they begin. Environmental (e)DNA provides a means of detecting species through their shed DNA that may be present in water, on various substrates, or in the air. Recently developed techniques have shown promise for point-of-use eDNA-based monitoring; however, these methods generally require sample processing techniques that are not feasible in most non-laboratory settings. Through this research project, we will improve the ease-of-use for these emerging eDNA screening approaches for invasive species monitoring using a two-step research process. First, we will perform a thorough literature review across diverse fields to identify alternative approaches that will streamline the method's implementation. Secondly, we will work with end-user stakeholders to develop and validate newly developed techniques. With goals directed toward end-user ease-of-use, frequent communication with our research stakeholders throughout the lifespan of the project will be critical to its success. To that end, port and customs agency personnel will be engaged to share research plans and findings at various phases of the project, including during study design, following collection of initial results, and upon completion of the project. In addition to the newly developed methods this research will establish, deliverables will include presentations at professional conferences such as the North American Invasive Species Management Association's annual meeting and publications in at least two peer-reviewed manuscripts that will focus on the literature review and the developed eDNA detection protocols. || Invasive species are ecologically damaging, economically costly, and increasingly prevalent throughout the world.

Maintaining these resources requires angler-desired fish populations and angler access to fishing sites (boat ramps, public land access). Fisheries throughout the world are currently undergoing unprecedented changes due to water level fluctuations and altered water quality resulting from climate change. The consequences of climate change to NGP fisheries are unknown but pose an immediate challenge for resource managers as angler access and opportunities can be jeopardized when boat ramps become inaccessible due to changing water levels and altered water quality could negatively affect desired fish species. This project aims to provide fisheries managers with information about how climate change will alter the hydrology of NGP lakes and subsequent changes in fish communities, angler access, angler behavior, and angler expenditures. A hydrologic model will be used to predict changes in lake size and water quality based on weather conditions under climate change. This information will then be used to predict changes in fish communities, identify current angler access locations that are at risk of becoming inaccessible, determine whether anglers will change the amount of time they spend fishing, and how these changes ultimately affect the amount of money anglers spend. By understanding which lakes will undergo these changes, fisheries managers will be able to make proactive decisions at state or regional levels about infrastructure development (number and location of new boat ramps) and ecosystem management (species and locations of fish stocking) that will maintain angler satisfaction and the economic benefits of recreational fisheries. || The Northern Glaciated Plains (NGP) of the upper Midwest, USA is an area where fishing generates millions of dollars a year for local and state economies.

More broadly, such results may improve understanding of the potential effects of non-point-source pollution on freshwater mussels. | | |[ Continuation of Sicklefin model development for GA DNR. ](/coopunits/project/243518044160/irwin) | June 2023 || We are extending model development to add additional data and explore potential variability (e.g., between males and females, over seasons) for estimating parameters for a rare fish species (<i>Moxostoma</i> sp.). || We are extending model development to add additional data and explore potential variability (e.g., between males and females, over seasons) for estimating parameters for a rare fish species (<i>Moxostoma</i> sp.). | | |[ Spot-tailed earless lizard status assessment ](/coopunits/project/243501146112/ashleybc) | December 2022 || We developed a population viability simulation model for the Spot-tailed earless lizard status assessment and listing decision. || We developed a population viability simulation model for the Spot-tailed earless lizard status assessment and listing decision. | | |[ Research and development of a suitable method for estimating weekly-stratified abundances of migrating juvenile salmonids in the absence of mark-recpature experiments ](/coopunits/project/243495270400/rperry) | January 2026 || This project will develop new methods for computing statistically valid abundance estimates without mark-recapture data. Innumerable fish monitoring projects rely upon mark-recapture data to track various population metrics, such as long-term trends in abundance, fish health, and outmigration timing. However, marking and recapturing fish is an invasive process that causes fish stress. Furthermore, this becomes more difficult as populations decline and become threatened and endangered. The objective of this study is to develop new methods for estimating abundances that does not depend on mark-recapture data. These methods must be biologically and technically sound, since these monitoring data are often subject to intense scrutiny and relied on in court cases. || For several decades, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has been working in close collaboration with tribal partners to run juvenile salmonid outmigration monitoring stations on the Klamath and Trinity rivers of north-western California. The monitoring stations employ the use of rotary screw traps that capture juvenile salmonids during their seasonal emigration from, or spatial redistribution within, the Klamath Basin. The various data products generated from this monitoring program are evaluated to track long-term trends in abundance, fish health, and outmigration timing, and provide vital real-time status data to inform water management decision making in a landscape with many interests competing for scare water resources. The annual outmigrant abundance estimates generated by this study have also been relied on extensively in various court documents and mandates (i.e. population-level prevalence of infection, 80% outmigration date predictor, etc.), particularly with regard to the Service's use of the estimates in calculating population-level effects of disease and mortality of juvenile Chinook and Coho salmon in the Klamath River. In recent years, adult returns of fall-run Chinook Salmon have been so low that Iron Gate Hatchery has not been able to meet its annual egg take goal, resulting a dramatic reduction in hatchery production. Given this trend, it is becoming increasingly likely that there will not be a sufficient number of hatchery fish available to meet the defined mitigation goals of the hatchery program, as well as to provide hatchery fish for the mark-recapture experiments. Additionally, four dams on the Klamath River mainstem are slated for removal that is tentatively proposed to occur in January 2023. A hatchery associated with one of these dams will also be decommissioned. Hence, regardless of the abundance of returning adult salmon stocks in the near future, it is assured that there will not be a sufficient number of hatchery fish available to conduct the mark-recapture experiments needed to estimate annual abundance of outmigrating juvenile salmonids. Given the importance of the estimates generated from this monitoring program, it is essential that a new method for computing statistically valid abundance estimates be developed that is biologically and technically sound, cost efficient to implement, and externally peer reviewed. The objective of this study is to develop this new methodology for estimating abundances that does not depend on the availability of hatchery fish for mark-recapture experiments. | | |[ Water Management to support endangered species in the ACF river basin ](/coopunits/project/243489048576/ashleybc) | September 2022 || Researchers use a science decision-making SDM approach to organize the decision making process and the relevant uncertainties to manage water flow in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) river basin to minimize harm to endangered species.

Despite the importance of ungulate migration for many ecosystems, the traditional migration corridors used by populations around the world face unprecedented change from the expanding footprint of human development. To conserve ungulate migration in the face of rapid environmental change and anthropogenic disturbance, an important first step is mapping the migration corridors. Currently, methodology exists to map corridors of migratory taxa with high fidelity to their migration routes and seasonal ranges (i.e., \"typical migration\"). However, when these approaches are applied to atypical migrants (i.e., wide-ranging but less predictable movement patterns), the results are often less than desirable - identifying areas that are too large for realistic landscape-scale prioritization or failing to capture key areas used outside the data collection window. The goal of this work is to derive generalizable and scalable methods to prioritize areas critical for maintaining connectivity for atypical migrants and to advance our ecological understanding of such wide-ranging movements.

This emerging disease is caused by an infectious, misfolded protein, known as a prion, that can be transmitted directly between hosts or via environmental reservoirs. Understanding the principles of infectious disease transmission is crucial for identifying management tools for disease control and prevention. Elucidating such principles is challenging in host-pathogen systems when transmission occurs both directly and indirectly through the environment. Researchers must disentangle diverse multi-scale drivers, from fine-scale host interactions with pathogens in environmental reservoirs to large-scale movements of natural populations in heterogeneous landscapes. This project is a collaboration among researchers across multiple agencies and universities including USGS Cooperative Wildlife Research Units (Wisconsin and Montana), Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of Montana, and Utah State University. This project proposes a deterministic model scaffold that formally incorporates heterogeneities in social behavior and movement with pathogen retention, transport, and infection potential in complex landscapes. A novel application of multi-scale homogenization to these models will analytically link fine-scale pathways of infection with large-scale population processes. These models will be developed using novel datasets based on new diagnostic techniques to determine the spatial extent and transmission potential of prions in the environment, and modern observation methods to give unprecedented insight into how host behavior and movement, in concert with individual interactions with environmental prion reservoirs, lead to disease transmission in complex environments. Predicted and forecasted prevalence surfaces, with measures of uncertainty, will guide future CWD prevention and control efforts. || Chronic wasting disease (CWD) threatens cervids across North America and impacts human communities that hunt, raise, or subsist on deer.

Lake sturgeon spawn at many sites within the LWS, and many fish make extensive spawning migrations into the Fox and Wolf Rivers and their tributaries. The contribution of different spawning sites to the overall lake sturgeon population is unknown and this information is critical to developing management strategies. Ongoing research is helping to address this need. As part of this ongoing research, sampling has demonstrated that larval lake sturgeon successfully hatch at several known spawning sites in the Wolf, Little Wolf, and Embarrass rivers. However, in two years of sampling, no lake sturgeon larvae were captured at the Princeton spawning site on the upper Fox Rive despite spawning activity being observed in both years. Determining what factors are limiting successful spawning of lake sturgeon in the Fox River could help guide efforts to increase recruitment and may help in determining whether direct habitat improvement may be beneficial or if changes at the watershed level would be required to overcome these limiting factors. We hypothesize that siltation rates and periphyton growth may be two factors that are primarily limiting successful hatching of lake sturgeon in the Fox River.

The impact of climate change threatens to compound these other factors. Our proposed work focuses on walleye fisheries of inland lakes of the Upper Great Lakes region, which have been declining since the early 2000s. Rather than the usual focus on understanding walleye population declines, our research emphasizes 'bright spots' - fisheries success stories. We seek to understand the drivers associated with fisheries that perform far better than expectations ('bright' fisheries). We will combine a suite of different approaches to provide new insights into walleye fishery bright spots: an ongoing whole-lake experimental removal of basses and sunfishes, observational studies of thermal-optical habitat use, a synthesis of how walleye fisheries responded to management restoration efforts, and a statistical analysis aimed at detecting walleye fishery bright spots. Members of the research team will work in partnership with state (MI, MN, WI) and tribal (GLIFWIC) biologists.

The impact of climate change threatens to compound these other factors. Our proposed work focuses on walleye fisheries of inland lakes of the Upper Great Lakes region, which have been declining since the early 2000s. Rather than the usual focus on understanding walleye population declines, our research emphasizes 'bright spots' - fisheries success stories.

Historically, CRF were distributed throughout the Cascade Range from southern British Columbia to southern Washington. Today, CRF appear to be absent from the North Cascades and are found primarily in Washington's South Cascades including Mount Rainier National Park (MORA) and surrounding wilderness. Using a combination of existing scat and camera trap sampling, radio-tagging foxes, and interviews, we will achieve the following objectives: 1) Develop estimates of density and survival of CRF in MORA and the surrounding area, and evaluate the effect of spatial covariates, including those related to threats, on density and survival, 2) Understand how coyotes influence CRF habitat use in MORA and the surrounding area, and 3) Use Indigenous and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) to understand pre-colonization versus contemporary coyote distribution in the southern Washington Cascades. This work will inform ongoing conservation of CRF throughout their range in Washington. || The Cascade red fox (CRF) is one of the rarest and most genetically distinct carnivores in North America.

Conservation activities for game and non-game species of many wildlife agencies are funded by hunter license sales, and therefore negative effects of CWD on cervid populations and/or hunter participation will have broad, down-stream impacts on wildlife conservation. This makes CWD a major management concern for wildlife agencies and has created demand for tools to monitor and manage CWD spread. Understanding the principles of transmission is crucial for developing effective CWD control tools to target key weaknesses in transmission. Elucidating such principles is challenging for CWD because it is transmitted both directly and indirectly, through environment exposure, and requires an understanding of diverse multi-scale drivers, from fine-scale host interactions with pathogens in environmental reservoirs to large-scale movements of natural populations in heterogeneous landscapes. To date, and often at high political cost, CWD managers have focused on mechanisms of direct transmission, because risk posed by indirect transmission is not understood. Therefore, in collaboration with the WI Department of Natural Resources, the WICWRU and University of Wisconsin, we will leverage and integrate our on-going innovations in CWD modeling, laboratory methods/experiments and field investigation to explore how heterogeneities in host habitat, behavior, and movement mediate direct transmission, deposition of prions into the environment, and subsequent indirect transmission via environmental reservoirs.

By identifying these few individuals and removing them, we will improve lamb survival. This strategy has been successfully demonstrated in other herds across the West in both free-ranging and captive herds, and during this project we will apply it in the Highlands Sheep herd in Montana.</b><br><br><b>We will also explore the impact of mineral supplementation on lamb survival and population growth. Many bighorn herds demonstrate trace mineral deficiency (based on domestic sheep reference standards). Of particular interest is selenium which has been linked to immune function. The hypothesis we will test is whether access to mineral supplements will increase lamb survival by providing a more robust immune response to M. ovi and other respiratory pathogens.</b><br><br><b>Thus, the overarching goal of our research is to explore whether management actions to improve the health of bighorn sheep herds will be successful.</b> | | |[ How will methods to suppress an invasive fish affect Yellowstone Lake water quality? ](/coopunits/project/243153299456/awalter8) | December 2025 || Yellowstone Lake has been the site of intensive efforts to conserve native Yellowstone cutthroat trout (<i>Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri</i>) and restore natural ecological function since invasive lake trout (<i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>) were first discovered there in 1994 (Koel et al. 2020a). Lake trout are apex predators that have decimated native trout populations following introductions in several large western lakes (Martinez et al. 2009). The lake trout population of Yellowstone Lake is resilient to gillnetting probably because of high survival of early life stages. Our primary objective is to estimate the degree to which adding carcasses and pellets to lake trout spawning sites may alter the water quality of Yellowstone Lake, and estimate how these changes may affect algal biomass and lake primary production. The project is a collaboration of researchers across multiple agencies and includes the National Park Service and the University of Wyoming. The study will provide standard operating procedures for a water quality monitoring program so that Yellowstone National Park can continue collecting data to estimate changes into the future. The water quality monitoring program will be based on methods developed in this study and suggest the best procedures moving forward. || Yellowstone Lake has been the site of intensive efforts to conserve native Yellowstone cutthroat trout (<i>Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri</i>) and restore natural ecological function since invasive lake trout (<i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>) were first discovered there in 1994 (Koel et al. 2020a).

CWD is a significant management challenge in part because the etiological agent, an infectious prion, is extremely difficult to destroy, and can be transmitted directly or indirectly. The majority of management interventions to date require altering densities of deer which is not universally supported by stakeholders. Thus, management agencies are in desperate need of new management tools and approaches that account for these socio-political pressures. To meet this need, we in collaboration with the USGS National Wildlife Health Center, WI Department of Natural Resources, Willamette University and Ventana Systems Inc will use a systems approach to dynamically map the complex relationships between biological, social, and political processes for CWD. Through participatory modeling, we will involve stakeholder groups and experts in CWD, social science, and deer and forest health to integrate the wealth of existing knowledge of the system into a systems map that describes its functioning and the linkages between ecological and social processes. The outcome will be a framework for examining CWD and its impact on deer and forest health that managers can use to discover potential novel management approaches or new means of implementing existing management tools to improve deer health while explicitly accounting for socio-political challenges. || Chronic wasting disease, a fatal neurologic disease of cervids that causes population declines and is increasing in intensity and spatial extent, has proven extremely difficult to manage despite intensive control efforts that have spanned several decades.

Reduced flows may negatively impact SWAP listed fish species through a variety of mechanisms, but elevated water temperatures during low flow events could be especially detrimental to SWAP species such as Striped Bass <i>Morone saxatilis</i> that require coolwater habitat. The genetically unique Striped Bass population endemic to the ACE basin seeks thermal refuge in the upper portions of the basin (e.g., North and South Fork Edisto River) during summer. For such species, decreased flow during summer may cause water temperatures to exceed thermal tolerances as has been observed for other coolwater riverine species. Key knowledge gaps limit our ability to understand how increases in summertime flow-dependent temperature may negatively impact species of greatest conservation need in the Edisto River Basin. First, there is no knowledge of the relationship between flow, summer air temperature, and water temperature. Developing a statistical relationship between these variables would be a first step towards assessing the thermal impacts of low flow during summer. Second, for many SWAP species, such as Bannerfin Shiner <i>Cyprinella leedsi</i>, there is no published data on thermal tolerance meaning that even if a relationship between flow and summertime water temperature were developed, we would be unable to understand the biological implications. These knowledge gaps are especially relevant given the large, predicted increases in water demand in the Edisto Basin and projected changes in temperature and precipitation due to climate change over the next several decades.This project will provide critical information necessary for protecting SWAP listed freshwater and diadromous fish species in the Edisto River Basin.

Over 1,200 captive-bred swans have been released in Iowa over the past 30 years, with ongoing banding and monitoring by the Iowa DNR. With this study, we will use that historical data to estimate past demographic rates and then project the population into the future to determine whether reintroductions are still needed to maintain a stable population. || Reintroduction efforts of trumpeter swans (<i>Cygnus buccinator</i>) began in Iowa in 1993. Since that time, 1,237 captive-bred swans have been released and the initial goal of 50 breeding pairs has been exceeded, with 119 nesting pairs documented in 2020. We analyzed banding data, counts, and nest monitoring data collected by Iowa Department of Natural Resources staff and volunteers using an integrated population model (IPM). The IPM includes state space models to estimate the total number of breeding adults and fledglings as well as a multistate mark-recapture model to estimate age- and sex-specific survival probabilities from live and dead recovery data. We then used the IPM to project population dynamics into the future to 1) evaluate whether reintroductions are still needed to maintain a stable population and 2) estimate a minimum viable population size to inform new recovery goals.

Some scientists argue that predation is increasing due to climate change, but others assert that increased human disturbance as a result of intensive nest monitoring is alterting predators to nest sites. To better understand this issue, we attached GPS tags to dunlin during the pre-breeding season, and used location data (downloaded remotely) to estimate nest success. Paired with estimated nest success from nearby long-term monitoring plots, we aim to understand nest survival in the absence of human disturbance. We are also investigating how environmental conditions influence adult behaviors and reproductive success. || Arctic-breeding shorebirds are one of the bird species experiencing the most severe declines in North America. They face several threats throughout the annual cycle, but predation is the main cause of nest failure in the Arctic. A recent study indicated nest predation had increased threefold in the Arctic during the past 20 years, changing the Arctic into \"ecological trap\" for migrating birds. These authors attributed this uptick in predation to climate-driven changes in the Arctic. However, Bulla et al. (2019) suggested that much of the increase in predation during the past 20 years might be explained by changes in research methods that lead to an artificially high predation rate. With this study, we are using a hands-off method to estimate nest survival using location data from GPS tags. Birds are captured during the pre-breeding season, and locations are downloaded remotely. We aim to: (1) obtain the first true estimates of nest survival in a shorebird species, (2) assess how conventional, human intensive monitoring techniques affect nest survival under different environmental conditions, (3) develop a best practice guide for accounting for human disturbance effects on shorebird nest survival, and (4) evaluate in an unbiased way how adult behavior prior to and during nesting varies with environmental conditions. | | |[ Automated Real-Time Analysis of Bald Eagle Nest Camera Imagery Using Machine Learning: with applications for investigating food resource use and nesting ecology in urbanized landscapes. ](/coopunits/project/241288058880/tammywilson) | December 2022 || Bald eagles populations are increasing rapidly in the lower 48 United States.

The only materials needed are an underwater slate and pencil, a good reference book, and access to the internet to submit the data online. The data is collated using a log scale for abundance where things are single (n=1), few (n=2-10), many (n=11-100), and abundant (n=101+). Recently Dr. Dan Greenberg developed a Bayesian model which can create area- and species- specific abundance estimates through time based on REEF RDT surveys. The abundance estimates have been used for species that are data-limited (e.g., Goliath Grouper in the southeastern US) and have been compared to scientific abundance estimates (e.g., coral reef fishes in Florida). This project seeks to build estimates of abundance for a variety of turtles species(Green turtles, Loggerhead turtles, and Hawksbill turtles) in multiple locations (Hawaii, Tropical Atlantic, and the Tropical Eastern Pacific). We hope to collaborate with scientists from NOAA to compare the abundance indices derived from REEF data to other indices and indicators of turtle populations. || The Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF) collects citizen science surveys for a variety of marine species.

Paddlefish begin life after hatching by feeding on individual prey zooplankton (water fleas). We anticipate that water clarity may affect the Paddlefish's ability to find zooplankton to eat. We will test this hypothesis by setting up tanks that vary in the amount of turbidity, including a tank with no turbidity (control tank), and let larval Paddlefish feed over the course of 2-3 hours. The tanks will all have the same amount of zooplankton in them for Paddlefish to feed on. At the end of the feeding time, the Paddlefish will be removed and humanely euthanized, and the amount of zooplankton eaten will be counted by dissecting the fish. || OK Department of Wildlife Conservation, OK Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, Department of Natural Resource Ecology and Management, and Department of Integrative Biology scientists are conducting lab-based research on the effect of turbidity on foraging by larval Paddlefish.

Further, tufted puffins are sensitive to changes in prey availability and as such, are good indicators of overfishing and ecosystem disturbance. Tufted puffin populations on the Oregon Coast have declined dramatically from over 5,000 birds in 1989 to 550 birds in 2021. In 2018, the Tufted Puffin Species Status Assessment (SSA) determined that factors related to breeding site conditions are one possible cause of puffin decline; however, little is known about the specific characteristics of nesting habitat along the Oregon coast, or how it relates to their population demographics. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a field study and a spatial analysis to examine the distribution of suitable breeding habitat for Tufted Puffins on the Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge, OR. We compared the topography, vegetation, and percent cover of Tufted Puffin breeding sites from 1971 to 2021 using aerial photos, data from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), other remote sensing data sets, and on-the-ground surveys. It is expected that the vegetation on nesting sites has changed over time due to site-specific, climatic, and environmental variables. Assessing how suitable puffin breeding habitat characteristics have changed over time will provide necessary information to guide refuge managers in habitat restoration and support adaptive management decisions. || Tufted puffins (Fratercula cirrhata) are an iconic species in the Pacific Northwest that provide a wide range of ecological, economic, and historically important services such as ecotourism for local communities and bringing marine derived nutrients to terrestrial habitats.

Assessing how suitable puffin breeding habitat characteristics have changed over time will provide necessary information to guide refuge managers in habitat restoration and support adaptive management decisions. | | |[ Evaluating a habitat suitability index for Bluenose Shiner populations in peninsular and panhandle Florida rivers ](/coopunits/project/241026668544/kyleamiller) | December 2024 || The Bluenose Shiner is a threatened species in the state of Florida.

This information is key for managing carp populations near the leading edge of the invasion in the Mississippi River. || Invasive carp continue to increase in abundance and distribution above LD 19 in the Upper Mississippi River. This increase may be due to either dispersal of adults and/or through successful reproduction and recruitment in newly invaded areas. Adult invasive Carp move upstream past LD 19, but movement rates are relatively low for the number of adults encountered in pools 19 and above. Conversely, larval invasive carp have been captured in pools 19-17 on an annual basis since 2014; yet, captures of juvenile invasive carp in the fall are quite rare. The lack of juvenile captures could indicate that larvae are not successfully surviving until the juvenile phase or that juveniles are very difficult to locate and capture despite extensive sampling efforts that have occurred in the UMR. Age structure of adult invasive carp above LD 19 indicates recruitment is consistent. However, whether recruitment of these fish into the population above LD 19 is occurring due to adults migrating upstream through LD 19 or due to recruitment of offspring produced above LD 19 is unknown. <br>Otolith microchemistry can be a useful tool to identify locations where recruited fish are produced. Previous otolith microchemistry work on the Upper Mississippi River indicated <20% of adult invasive carp recruited above LD 19. However, this analysis was conducted with a limited number of fish and it remains unknown whether this recruitment was the result of one large year class or due to low levels of consistent recruitment on an annual basis. Understanding where recruitment is occurring and the frequency of recruitment (e.g., annually or periodically) is critical for implementing management actions such as commercial harvest and installation of barriers. Therefore, we propose to assess the historical recruitment of invasive carp above LD 19 using adult age structure to determine if they are recruiting above LD 19 and if so, the temporal variation in recruitment. This information will be critical to assess if the larvae being produced above LD 19 annually are not recruiting or if they are surviving but going undetected despite extensive sampling efforts. <br>Silver Carp will be collected by commercial anglers in pools 17-19, fish will be measured for total length, and otoliths will be removed for age estimation. Because an estimated 15% of the population was produced above LD 19, we will need to collect approximately 1,000 fish per pool for adequate sample size. Fish will be randomly subsampled per 1 cm group and age-length keys will be used to develop age-frequency histograms for each pool. Once age-structure is determined, we will assess which age-classes are considered recruited to the gear and can be used for Maciena's catch curve analysis to assess historical recruitment of Silver Carp in pools 17-19 of the Upper Mississippi River. Most Silver Carp captured above LD 19 are 5-10 years old, with peak catches not occurring until age 6-7. Therefore, we anticipate having approximately five age-classes where recruitment can be assessed (6-10 year old fish). Otolith microchemistry will be completed on approximately 60 fish per year class at Southern Illinois University to assess if their natal origin is above or below LD 19. The proportion of Silver Carp produced above versus below LD 19 per year class will be applied to the age-structure of fish captured from each pool to construct separate age-frequency histograms for fish originating from above versus below LD 19. Finally, catch curves will be constructed and residuals will be used to estimate year class strength for fish originating above and below LD 19 for both pools 17, 18, and 19. Finally, environmental conditions (e.g., mean June discharge) can be used to predict variation in recruitment based on environmental conditions. <b> </b><br><br> | | |[ Retrospective recruitment analysis of bigheaded carp in the Upper Mississippi River. ](/coopunits/project/241010563072/jgolcherbenavides) | October 2024 || This project examines microchemical signatures of otolith cores from invasive bigheaded carp to determine whether their natal origin was upstream or downstream of Lock and Dam #19, a partial dispersal barrier, in the Upper Mississippi River and whether yearclass strength is associated with environmental variables.

This project will continue ongoing mark-recapture surveys conducted by the Arizona Game and Fish Department to provide demographic parameter estimates for THEQ and test the application of GPS telemetry to collect fine-scale movement data on THEQ. This project is conducted in collaboration with Arizona Game and Fish Department and Dr. Matt Goode at the University of Arizona. | | |[ Predicting from the past - identifying characteristics of invasion-resistant and invasion-prone waterbodies to aid horizon scanning ](/coopunits/project/238817347584/lwaterhouse) | December 2024 || Waterbodies in the Upper Mississippi River Basin are at high risk of invasion by several aquatic invasive species (AIS), with often devastating ecological impacts to water quality and economic consequences for water-related infrastructure and management. Yet understanding which sites are most prone to invasion, and by which species, is lacking, making it difficult for managers and policy makers to know where to focus prevention and mitigation efforts. Some waterbodies in the region have proved resistant to forecasted invasion, and these situations may provide clues as to the conditions and processes producing this apparent resistance. If patterns can be revealed, this would allow managers to more accurately predict invasion risk throughout the region and thus to triage sites for prevention and mitigation efforts. Additionally, such knowledge may allow managers to develop and apply strategies that promote resistance to invasion in other waterbodies. We will use a combination of machine learning and statistical modeling to leverage region-wide waterbody invasion histories and datasets on the physical, biological, chemical, anthropogenic, and geographic characteristics of these waterbodies to: a) identify that increase or decrease invasion risk, b) categorize all waterbodies in the region based on their invasion risk, and c) provide a decision support tools for managers and policy makers to identify at-risk sites. || Waterbodies in the Upper Mississippi River Basin are at high risk of invasion by several aquatic invasive species (AIS), with often devastating ecological impacts to water quality and economic consequences for water-related infrastructure and management.

However, hatchery programs are also fraught with major challenges including poor hatchery fish performance. Improving the success of hatchery salmon and reducing the risks they present for wild populations could lead to greatly improved economic and ecological outcomes for Pacific salmon fisheries. This project directly addresses this management need by investigating the impacts of hatchery rearing on the microbial communities that populate the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of Pacific salmon, specifically juvenile Chinook salmon. In salmonid species, the gut microbiome has shown potential as a useful tool for monitoring hatchery fish health and for reducing disease risk through probiotic enhancement. The goal of our research is to identify hatchery rearing practices that result in improved gut microbiomes for hatchery-reared juvenile salmon (i.e., gut microbiomes that are more likely to resemble those of wild fish). This information will inform hatchery management practices to improve disease resistance, enhance fitness, and potentially mitigate some of the negative effects of hatchery fish on wild populations by reducing disease transmission and competition. This work will be the first to address the causes and consequences of microbiome differences between hatchery and wild Pacific salmon and will lay the groundwork for future studies assessing the long-term effects of gut microbiome disruption on Pacific salmon populations. || Hatchery rearing and release programs have long been integral to salmon fisheries management as a way to supplement commercial and recreational harvests, and these programs have become increasingly important to fishers as wild stocks continue to decline.

There is a put and take Rainbow Trout fishery and a naturalized Brown Trout population in the tailwater below the dam. Rainbow Trout stocking occurs throughout the tailwater down as far as the Monaghan/Womack Access (MWA). The section of the Little Red River below the MWA does not routinely receive stocked Rainbow Trout. Quantified information regarding the population characteristics for Rainbow Trout and Brown Trout below the MWA and the extent to which this river section of interest consists of transient or permanent residents is limited. Any future management actions would benefit from the empirical data regarding both Rainbow Trout and Brown Trout from the section of the Little Red River below the MWA. Hence, there is a need for characterization of the two trout species in that section of the river. Furthermore, thermal dynamics of the Little Red River below the MWA would influence trout growth and survival. Hence there is also a need to understand the relationship between dam releases, air temperatures and water temperatures in the portions of the Little Red River above as well as below the MWA. However, water temperature data from this section of the river and interannual changes in thermal habitat availability below the MWA are nonexistent. || There exists a need to understand basic population demographics of Rainbow Trout and Brown Trout below the current management boundaries for trout within the Little Red River, Arkansas. Further, basic information regarding water temperature suitability for sustaining trout populations within the Little Red Tailwater is needed. This project is a collaboration between the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, and the Nebraska Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit. Decisions regarding trout management boundaries and water releases to maintain adequate water temperatures will results from this research. | | |[ Brown Trout Movement in Little Red River tailwater ](/coopunits/project/238658295808/jspurgeon2) | June 2025 || The population of Brown Trout below the Greers Ferry dam on the Little Red River (Greers Ferry Tailwater) is unique among trout populations in Arkansas. It is the only self-sustaining trout fishery in the State. While other trout fisheries in tailwaters below dams on the White River and its tributaries require stocking to sustain the fishery, no Brown Trout stocking is required in the Greers Ferry tailwater. This unique situation calls for a considered approach to managing this Brown Trout fishery, because of the inability to influence the fishery by varying stocking levels. Management of this Brown Trout fishery requires some understanding of spawning within the tailwater. This issue was the subject of a previous research project. Trout are managed in the Greers Ferry tailwater from the dam to the Monaghan/Womack Access (MWA) at the Hwy 305 bridge, east of Pangburn, Arkansas (~48 km or 30 miles). The magnitude and persistence of a Brown Trout fishery below the MWA is unclear. Data on trout movement within this section of the Little Red River or between this section and the tailwater above the MWA do not exist. This data gap regarding Brown Trout movement patterns will be addressed by this proposed project. || The magnitude and persistence of a Brown Trout fishery below the trout management zone in the Little Red River is unclear. Data on trout movement within this section of the Little Red River or between this section and the tailwater above do not exist.

These data originate from within central Alaska national parks managed by the U.S. National Park Service as well as other lands in the region managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. Research under this award will be guided by the following questions: To what extent can sites across Alaskan public lands be classified meaningfully based on a suite of shared environmental conditions, and do these classes, in turn, contain clearly defined ecological communities? How are species and habitat distributions altered across Alaskan public lands based on habitat conditions and expected environmental shifts under climate change or human use such as mining, and are certain ecological communities or habitats at particularly high risk of decline? || Streams and rivers on public lands in central Alaska are subject to acute and increasing ecological stress from climate change and in-stream mining.

Indicators such as total biomass and mean trophic level derived from these data and from CASM outputs inform management and facilitate assessments of on-going and predicted coastal change and restoration activities on fisheries, but rely on consistent sampling to enable comparisons across space and time. Changes in coastal estuarine gradients, combined with the availability of new sampling technologies, highlight a need to assess the potential consequences of changing sampling technologies on fisheries data and the cascading impact on model outputs. In Louisiana, USA, CASM models are used to inform coastal restoration projects, relying on 40 years of fisheries-independent data derived from 50' seine sampling. However, alternative use of electrofishers as a sampling method has been proposed to replace the seine sampling. In this study, we examine data from concurrent seine and electrofisher sampling in Barataria Basin, Louisiana, and compare biomass, assemblage data and CASM outputs related to species biomass, food web structure and energy cycling. In a paired comparison of data in 2018-2019, the electrofisher captured higher total catch and diversity compared to the seine. The electrofisher samples were dominated by shrimp (grass, white, brown) and larger bodied fish, while seine samples were dominated by smaller-bodied fish (i.e., anchovy, menhaden). Ecosystem indicators derived from running the CASM using biomass data from seine and electrofisher sampling separately in two different simulation exercises provide contrasting results. In Simulation Exercise 1, the use of different datasets (long-term not result in large or long-running changes in the simulated biomasses over time. In contrast, in Simulation Exercise 2, CASM model outputs using adjusted gear ratios indicated changes in biomass structure when using electrofisher data, with a doubling of total food web biomass due to the increased shrimp count, and a 13% increase in total energy flow through the food web. Conversions based on area and gear efficiency for overall catch may be useful in maintaining the continuity of historical data. However, differences in species-specific catch due to gear selectivity could have large consequences for constructing and calibrating fish and ecosystem models and remain difficult to reconcile. These differences in assemblages, and estimated biomasses for key food web species, suggest careful consideration in changing gears. || Long-term fisheries independent sampling data inform fisheries management and drive models. Changing environment and sampling gear impact ecological indicators and outcomes from food web model simulations. Consideration of changes in long-term estuarine fisheries independent sampling methods by the state of Louisiana prompted a study to examine the potential consequences of changing methods after 40 years of data collection. In collaboration with Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, The Water Institute of the Gulf and the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority of Louisiana, comparisons of electrofisher, seine and throw trap sampling were conducted, examining species composition, size distribution, and environmental conditions.

Together, using data from a large, multi-state citizen science project, and primary data collected in the field, we aim to fill critical gaps in understanding related to habitat use across a wide geographic extent, and specific to hibernation and nesting sites to help inform habitat conservation and management decisions. | | |[ Molt Timing and Sample Collection for Future Derivation of Harvest for Purple and Common Gallinules in Louisiana ](/coopunits/project/232724080640/sking16) | December 2022 || Gallinule harvest in Louisiana represents 85% and 60% of the total harvest of both Purple and Common Gallinules within the Mississippi Flyway and nationally, respectively. However, for both Purple and Common Gallinules, there are no available data for either species at any scale (state, flyway, or nationally) on which informed management actions can be made.

In 2014, 1308 trap nights in high quality habitat produced no captures of VNFS, although 674 nest box checks produced 12 adult individuals (56 box checks/squirrel). Since nest boxes are arranged in lines, population densities cannot be estimated. Additionally, nest box occupancy is generally low, although occupancy rates are steady. Therefore, the scale of the proposed red spruce restoration and low capture success of VNFS make it extremely difficult to determine how restoration may influence population sizes. However, the use of ultrasonic acoustic surveys may be used as a useful monitoring tool to determine the potential effects of treatments on VNFS occupancy of treated low quality habitats and adjacent high quality habitats. Acoustics has been used as a success monitoring tool on the Carolina northern flying squirrel in western North Carolina and to assess the effects of harvest on flying squirrel habitat occupancy. The ability to differentiate between VNFS and southern flying squirrels quantitatively and qualitatively make this survey method suitable in places where both species are sympatric. Pre-treatment acoustic surveys occurred prior to restoration treatments in the Upper Greenbrier on the Greenbrier Ranger District. More restoration treatments are proposed on the Monongahela. We propose the use of ultrasonic acoustics to monitor pre- and post-treatment VNFS occupancy in areas where restoration activities will occur in order to monitor the persistence of flying squirrel occupancy. || The recently de-listed Virginia northern flying squirrel is an at-risk species of high conservation concern in West Virginia and Virginia. Efforts to restore its red spruce habitat are complicated by potential short-term impacts to the squirrel from restoration silviculture. The Virginia Unit is using new acoustic approaches to monitor for the presence of squirrels before, during and after stand and landscape treatments to help managers assess risks and balance future habitat improvement with short-term impacts. | | |[ An Evaluation of Factors Limiting Plant Establishment at Malheur Lake ](/coopunits/project/232720576512/bboos) | May 2023 || During most of the 1900s, Malheur Lake at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge supported an abundant mixture of emergent and submergent vegetation. However, after deep and prolonged flooding in the 1980s, vegetation disappeared and has not reestablished throughout most of the lake. In this study, we are using seedbank experiments and exclosures to identify the factors affecting germination and establishment. The seedbank experiment will determine whether an adequate seedbank exists in the soils. The exclosures, placed across an elevation gradient, weill determine whether herbivory is affecting establishment. During the first year of the study, numerous germinants were observed in the seedbank experiment and extensive germination occurred in the exclosures. However, following germination in the exclosures, the majority of plants died presumably due to soil moisture declines. The second year of the study will include a seedbank analysis from a larger portion of the lake, continued evaluation of the exclosures, and more extensive soil moisture monitoring. || During most of the 1900s, Malheur Lake at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge supported an abundant mixture of emergent and submergent vegetation.

Environmental variation linked with hydrology and seasonality interact with life history strategies of fishes to determine phenology of spawning in riverine systems. This study examines the patterns of larval fish abundance in relation to discharge and microhabitat water velocity to better understand fish spawning phenology and its connection to hydrology. From May 2021 to July 2021, we sampled larval fish weekly in Twelve Mile Creek using larval fish seines. We collected discharge data from an upstream USGS gage and microhabitat data was collected at each sample point within a 200m stream reach. We identified all larval fish specimens to family and measured their standard length. We detected temporal patterns in larval fish abundance, with peak Percidae and Leuciscidae abundance in late July and the highest Catostomidae abundance in late May-early June. We found Percidae abundance was associated with greater maximum discharge and increase variation in discharge, Leuciscidae was negatively related to mean discharge, and a negative association between Catostomidae abundance and variation in discharge. We also detected a positive association between Percidae abundance and microhabitat depth. Overall, our results suggest that the spatial and temporal patterns of larval fish abundance are influence by river hydrology and microhabitat variables. || Environmental variation linked with instream flow variability and seasonality interact with life history strategies of fishes to determine phenology of spawning in riverine systems. However, little research on relationship between instream flow variability and fish spawning has been done in South Carolina. Understanding the relationship between instream flow variability and fish spawning will help determine the flow regime components that influence fish spawning and guide state flow standards. This project aims to: 1) identifying the timing, duration, and magnitude of stream flow driving spawning intensity in a lotic system, 2) quantifying the influence of environmental variables on larval fish assemblage in a lotic system.

Since that time, the stocks have rebounded in Lake Superior, although they once again appear to be in decline. The original decline in the mid-1900s was attributed to a variety of anthropogenic factors including overfishing, pollution, and introduced species.

Specifically it provided evidence-based scientific advice to developing Atlantic coastal states, and other ICCAT Contracting Parties, for them to adopt appropriate conservation and management measures within the framework of the ICCAT. The AOTTP awarded a contract to study the growth of 3 tropical tuna species from the Atlantic Ocean - Bigeye, Yellowfin, and Skipjack to Dr. John M. Hoenig of Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences (VIMS) at the College of William and Mary with Dr. Lynn Waterhouse (currently with the Minnesota Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, then with the John G. Shedd Aquarium) as a co-Principal Investigator on the project. The growth studies utilized past data along with tagging data and hard part data (otoliths and spines) from the AOTTP program. The project also led to the development of a novel method for estimating ages from spines when vascularization may obscure the central rings of the spine. Vascularization is a problem for the spines of many tuna species along with other marine and freshwater species.

Animals infested with such mites lose hair, body weight and can ultimately die. Bobcats and coyotes in the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area in southern California suffer from manage. Bobcats in the area appear quite susceptible to mange due in part to weakened immune systems from ingesting rodenticides used by humans to poison rodents. California banned the private use of such highly toxic rodenticides in January 2021 but we do not yet know the potential positive effect on wildlife in the region. Most recently, observations by field personnel and the interested public suggest bobcats may be entering a mange outbreak period where high mortality rates and negative effects on the population can be expected. Outside of capturing and treating every individual in the population - an impossible task - area managers do not have a tool to address the burgeoning mange outbreak.<br>Treating mange with topical medicines has been effective for animals in captivity or those captured in the wild as part of research and monitoring efforts. There are no examples, however, of attempts to noninvasively treat mange in wild, free-ranging animals. We want to test a novel, noninvasive technique - medicinal rub stations - for treating mange in free-ranging felids and canids by exploiting their propensity to roll and scent-mark in foreign odors.

However, we do not know their current distribution, occupancy, or abundance<b> </b>in the state. We attempted to detect not only these small carnivores, but also more common ones, such as badgers, bobcats, and coyotes. Specifically, 1) are there extant populations of rare mesocarnivores in Idaho (e.g., kit fox) and, 2) can data from cameras be used in population monitoring programs for more common, harvested mesocarnivore species (e.g., bobcats)? Beginning in July 2021, we deployed and maintained 98 camera traps in grassland and canyon habitats in southern Idaho. In fall of 2021, we analyzed a total of 45,965 images and videos from camera traps. While we successfully detected a large variety of species, we did not detect kit foxes or ringtails. We detected one spotted skunk, demonstrating that although infrequent, these animals exist in southern Idaho.

The influence of climate change on water temperature has substantial implications for non-native fish distributions because it influences individual fish survival, growth, reproduction, and dispersal as well as population and community structure. Understanding water temperature variability and the effects of climate change on aquatic thermal regimes is critical for managing non-native fishes now and in the future, especially in Florida where nearly 200 non-native fishes have been documented.

Hydropeaking flows from Crisp County Dam have reduced Shoal Bass recruitment in the river downstream, prompting GADNR to initiate a stocking program in the 1970s that continues today. Geomorphology of the Flint River changes beginning in this section, characterized by limestone outcroppings, deep channel, and a hydraulic connection to the Upper Floridan aquifer resulting in large groundwater inputs. Approximately 32 km downstream of Crisp County Dam, the Flint River enters the headwaters of Lake Chehaw, created by Albany Dam. Below that dam is a 150-km reach of river that ends at the headwaters of Lake Seminole around Bainbridge, Georgia. This reach is the second-longest undammed section of stream across the entire Shoal Bass range. Hydropeaking flows from Crisp County Dam are reregulated through Albany Dam, and like upstream, these flows have reduced Shoal Bass recruitment in the river downstream, prompting GADNR to stock Shoal Bass. Geomorphology of this reach of the Flint River is similar to the one above, with the addition of numerous springs that add to stream flow and provide summer thermal refugia for species such as Gulf-strain Striped Bass. In the late 1800s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opened and maintained a 1-m low-water navigation channel from Albany, Georgia, to Bainbridge, Georgia, to facilitate steamboat and barge navigation . This was accomplished by dredging and blasting shoals, which resulted in man-made rock islands that are still extant today. The effects of these activities on the Shoal Bass population are unknown, but likely have resulted in deeper channels, swifter currents, and possibly exacerbating the impacts of hydropeaking flows. || The objectives of this study are to 1) estimate exploitation of Shoal Bass in the lower Flint River, 2) evaluate the current 305-mm MLL, as well as other harvest restriction scenarios, on the population, 3) describe seasonal movement patterns and habitat use of Shoal Bass in the Flint River between Albany Dam and Lake Seminole, and 4) estimate hatch-date distribution and daily growth of age-0 Shoal Bass in the lower Flint River basin. | | |[ Integrated population modeling to improve forecasting for coho salmon and steelhead returns and the status of their habitat in Oregon ](/coopunits/project/228062621696/kennkath) | June 2024 || We are using more than 20 years of salmonid monitoring data from the ODFW Aquatic Inventories project, Western Oregon Rearing Project, Salmonid Life Cycle Monitoring project, and Oregon Adult Salmonid Inventory and Sampling projects to 1) develop a population model that will assist ODFW and partner agencies in predicting adult returns of Oregon Coast coho salmon and steelhead populations, thus providing managers with improved forecasts to set fish harvest recommendations and 2) develop Oregon Coast coho and steelhead juvenile habitat models using remotely sensed and modeled covariates to describe the productivity and suitability of juvenile salmon habitat.

These conditions may make it easier for the non-native fish assemblage to escape through the penstocks and make it downstream of Lake Powell into Glen Canyon, Marble Canyon, and Grand Canyon. If so, these non-native fishes could threaten native fishes downstream of Glen Canyon Dam. Non-native fishes have been captured below the dam in the tailwater area and downstream to Lee's Ferry, some (e.g., green sunfish <i>Lepomis cyanellus</i>) may be reproducing naturally in the slough below the dam but likely would have originated from Lake Powell, and other captured fishes (e.g., smallmouth bass <i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>, walleye <i>Sander vitreus</i>) also have the potential to have escaped. || We will characterize the fish assemblage in the Glen Canyon Dam forebay using a variety of sampling methods.

Providing adequate habitat for all life stages of imperiled fishes is a primary management action needed in the San Juan River basin. In-stream habitat in the San Juan River has been simplified by channel narrowing and reduced channel migration due to an altered flow regime and establishment of non-native vegetation. The latter is primarily Russian olive (<i>Elaeagnus angustifolia</i>) that has armored the river banks contributing to habitat simplification to the detriment of native fishes. Low velocity habitats are hypothesized to be important to survival of ESA-listed, young-of-year Colorado Pikeminnow <i>Ptychocheilus lucius </i>and other native fishes. Juvenile Colorado Pikeminnow select for low-velocity habitats in the San Juan River, but these habitats have been reduced due to degradation of in-stream habitat. Given that Colorado Pikeminnow are experiencing continued declines across their range in the Upper Colorado River basin, there is a need to assess further management actions to improve survival and retention. We will use existing non-native woody structure to increase habitat complexity, quantify changes in habitat from the addition of woody structure, and quantify differences in macroinvertebrate densities between reaches with addition of woody structure and control reaches. || Habitat loss and degradation is one of the leading hypothesized mechanisms for declines in native fish occurrence and abundance in the Colorado River basin.

Most fish species native to the CRB are found nowhere else and have declined dramatically coincident with the damming and regulation of the CRB. Substantial resources are invested to recover these fish species with efforts largely focused on restoring physical conditions (i.e., habitat, flow or water temperature) and removing non-native fish species. There has been minimal focus on quantifying changes to the primary (i.e., plants) and secondary production (e.g., insects) that fuel native fish species. In the Grand Canyon segment of the CRB, flow, turbidity and depletion of phosphorous in Lake Powell have been linked to primary production and primary production has been linked to various fish species. However, these linkages have not been studied upriver of Lake Powell despite these upper segments being the focus of recovery efforts for endangered fishes. Based on research in other rivers, we expect primary and secondary production (hereafter river productivity) in the CRB is impacted by river regulation, modified hydrology, and agricultural and municipal runoff, with climate change likely to bring further modifications. If river productivity is limiting fish species, then increasing water temperatures and declining runoff associated with climate change may exacerbate this limitation. Thus, to better predict the impacts of ongoing climate change on the imperiled fish species of the CRB, it is imperative to identify current drivers of river productivity. || The Colorado River Basin (CRB) is one of the most overallocated river networks in the world and is experiencing declining watershed runoff due to climate change.

However, there is evidence that over the longer term, Tui Chub abundance has been declining, concordant with declines in lake elevation. The mechanism(s) driving this decline remains unknown and could include changes in food availability with changes in lake biogeochemistry, spawning and recruitment failure due to lack of littoral habitat, or a community food-web change. This uncertainty must be addressed in order to ensure the continued recovery of LCT including new natural recruitment, and to assist in determining stocking levels in order to not exceed carrying capacity. <br>The project being proposed will explore the factors determining food availability for Tui Chub, changes in littoral habitat as they may affect spawning and recruitment success, and potential changes to fish community dynamics, all with consideration of the potential concordant declines in lake elevation. || The importance of tui chub as the primary food source for recovering Lahontan Cutthroat Trout (LCT) in Pyramid Lake, Nevada has been firmly established.

However, there are often mismatches in time and location between nuisance beavers trapped and sometimes euthanized versus places where relocated beavers are desired and would have a high likelihood of success in terms of assisting river restoration. Locations with the greatest likelihood of success have adequate food and dam material and avoid potential conflict with people and infrastructure. While some important information has been gained about the best practices for beaver relocation, there is still considerable uncertainty regarding timing, density, minimum number, age structure, mate selection, family structure, individual traits that predict success, and retention. Simultaneously, restoration in desert rivers offers unique challenges. Desert rivers are dynamic, transport large sediment loads, and often have degraded fish and riparian habitat due to loss of spring snow-melt floods (water over-allocation) and effects of invasive vegetation.<br> <br><b>THE SAN RAFAEL and PRICE RIVERS</b><br>The San Rafael and Price Rivers offer an ideal situation to learn about the combined practices of passive restoration using BDAs, tamarisk removal, and relocated beavers and their subsequent behavior. An adaptive, experimental, science-based restoration have been developed for these rivers and are currently in the implementation stages. The plans were developed based on graduate student research at Utah State University; information from two master's theses on fish ecology and one on geomorphologic change were combined with detailed vegetation mapping funded by BOR, BLM, and NRCS to develop a master plan for each river. A section of the Price River is meant to serve as a demonstration area for future projects to visit. The San Rafael and Price Rivers (and similar tributaries) are occupied by all three of the imperiled Three Species (flannelmouth sucker, bluehead sucker, roundtail chub) and utilized by several of the endangered fishes of the Upper Colorado River Basin.<br> <br>Despite occurrence of native fish species, the lower San Rafael and upper Price Rivers are now characterized by long runs of extremely simplified habitat, and almost all complex habitat is gone. The SRRP is currently being implemented in an experimental fashion and includes treatments of tamarisk removal, BDA installation, gravel introduction, and also cottonwood replanting with early growth stimulation treatments. Preliminary observations indicate the BDAs are providing localized habitat complexity for fish in the form of riffles, deep pools, exposed coarse substrate, and some bank erosion and localized channel widening. In addition, when summer flows reached 3 cfs and the San Rafael River started to dry in the summer of 2016, the scour pools below BDAs offered refuge to and were used by stocked endangered fishes and the Three Species. Most recently in the spring and fall of 2021, 70 BDAs were installed along reaches of the Price River.<br> <br>BDAs are underutilized by beavers in restoration areas because beaver densities are low, likely due to historical trapping and previously unsuitable habitat. However, the potential for beaver to thrive in these two rivers is evident at a site called Cottonwood Wash in the San Rafael River, which has extremely good fish habitat and experiences considerable beaver activity. Locations of the experimental BDAs have excellent potential for change: tamarisk has been removed, cottonwoods and willows are locally abundant to provide food, and piles of removed tamarisk are available as dam-building material. There is extremely little potential for conflict between man and beaver at this remote and extreme desert location (BLM and State land).<br> <br>In 2019 and 2020, before installment of BDAs was completed, 23 resident beavers in experimental sites within the Price and San Rafael Rivers were captured, fitted with VHF and/or PIT tags, and monitored to obtain baseline information on natural beaver behavior and space use. At the same time and at the same locations, 47 beavers were translocated and fitted with the same tags, before they were released along the Price and San Rafael Rivers. Of these translocated beavers, 4 remained alive, but all had emigrated outside the study sites by the end of the two-year study. Now that BDAs have been installed, additional monitoring of resident beavers and release of translocated beavers is necessary to determine whether the BDAs are useful for improving the efficacy of using translocated beavers within a river restoration plan and the response of resident beavers to these efforts.<br> <br><b>OBJECTIVES </b><br>The proposed objective of this study is to relocate beavers to the BDA sites along the Price River, study the recolonization process, identify whether translocated beavers are more likely to survive and stay at the release site if BDAs have been installed prior to release, and determine if individual behavioral traits of beavers can inform recolonization efforts. During spring/fall of 2021 and 2022, we will continue to capture and tag resident and translocated beavers, fitting adults with a PIT-tag and VHF-tag and younger animals with only a PIT-tag. We will monitor their space use and survival by tracking their unique VHF signals and detections at PIT-tag antennas (permanent and mobile units). These data will then be compared with the same data from resident and translocated beavers that were monitored for the two years before BDAs were installed (spring/fall 2019 and 2020). We will conduct several behavioral assays for evaluating behavioral traits, including human interaction tests, reactivity/tameness tests, novel object tests, and behavior at release. During human interaction tests, each time a person interacts with a beaver, the beaver's initial reaction will be scored using an aggressiveness index. For reactivity/tameness tests, we will record whether the beaver ate, defecated, and manipulated its environment each day. The novel object test will involve placing a new object in the quarantine kennel on the last night of quarantine and using game cameras to record latency to approach the object and latency to touch the object. We will also document behavior during release. This includes latency to emerge from the cage after the door has been opened, path to water (direct/meandering), and general behavior during release.<br> <br>A second objective of the continued research is to evaluate the quarantine procedures for reducing transmittable diseases and parasites between watersheds. Most state agencies, including Utah, have developed a protocol for translocation of beavers. In most cases, the protocol either prohibits moving beavers between watersheds or requires a quarantine period to rid the beavers of any invasive species, parasites, or diseases beavers may carry before they are placed in a new watershed. However, there is almost no scientific data to guide the specifics of the protocols for this second option. Our goal is to obtain and test water samples from beavers during quarantine to determine if there are invasive species, parasites, or diseases present and if the quarantine protocol is effective at eliminating them. The protocol in Utah requires the water be changed each day, and our tests will determine if their presence ends by the end of the quarantine period. We aim to obtain these water samples from residents within the Price and San Rafael Rivers (as controls) and translocated beavers prior to release on these rivers. We may also obtain water samples from the Beaver Center in Logan, Utah, or beaver translocations conducted by the state in the Cedar City area to ensure sufficient sample size for analyses.<br> <br>Combined, these objectives will help determine the most effective (in terms of restoration and cost) combinations of passive restoration techniques and beaver reintroduction strategies. || Passive restoration of rivers and streams with beavers and beaver dam analogs (BDAs) is rapidly growing in response to demonstrated success and affordability.

This project would build off of the established partnership between USU, UDWR, BOR, BLM, and others, along with the work this team has already completed within the system. Many of these entities are currently providing funding and in-kind support for the implementation and monitoring, offering a situation to capitalize on existing riverine management expertise and resources as well as an extensive knowledge base on fish, aquatic ecology, and geomorphology. This research will identify whether translocated beavers are more likely to survive and stay at the release site if BDAs (beaver dam analogues) have been installed prior to release, determine if individual behavioral traits of beavers can inform recolonization efforts, and evaluate the quarantine procedures for reducing transmittable diseases and parasites between watersheds, all to improve management practices here and elsewhere. | | |[ RWO 102: TCU 436 Development of an Effective Survey Methodology for Detection and Monitoring of Texas Kangaroo Rats ](/coopunits/project/226714222592/clint.boal) | May 2024 || Texas kangaroo rat is believed to be declining and is a species of substantive conservation concern.

Unfortunately, due to a combination of anthropogenic actions the spring and winter runs are listed as threatened and endangered, respectively. Monitoring for juveniles in these imperiled populations on the Sacramento River uses a network of monitoring sites with varying reliability. In the upper river, a rotary screw trap located at the Red Bluff Diversion Dam can produce population-level abundance estimates for juvenile Chinook salmon. However, in the lower river monitoring sites are unable to produce population-level abundances due to the unreliability of run identification, low juvenile catch rates, and the inability to estimate gear efficiencies. Environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques could be used to more effectively sample in the lower river, where salmon densities are lower. This data would ultimately facilitate a better understanding of the timing, survival, abundance, and movement of juvenile Chinook Salmon throughout the river. <br><br>This research will focus on utilizing eDNA to develop a quantitative method for estimating juvenile Chinook salmon abundance in the Sacramento River. We will be looking at the correlation between eDNA concentrations and juvenile out-migrating trap abundances at the Red Bluff Diversion Dam site. Ideally, out of the four run types of Chinook salmon in the Sacramento River the focus will be on the spring and winter run types. In addition to the correlation between eDNA concentrations and abundance, we will examine if these eDNA abundances estimates are a function of environmental covariates (i.e. temperature, flow, turbidity, etc).<br> || The Sacramento River is unique in that it manages four different ecotypes of Chinook salmon (i.e., spring run, fall run, late-fall run, and winter run) each exhibiting varying life history traits consisting of the timing of adult immigration, spawning, juvenile rearing, and smolt outmigration.

This project will investigate the degree to which bobwhite presence is an indicator of the presence of other priority bird species and the benefits of WLFW practices to nongame birds. || In a state dominated by agriculture and private land, programs like USDA Working Lands for Wildlife seek to incentivize private landowners to conduct habitat restoration and management on their properties. Species such as the northern bobwhite are often used as umbrella species, with the expectation that if bobwhite are present at a site other grassland-dependent and early successional species will be as well. With this project we aim to evaluate the veracity of this assumption by estimating co-occurrence of bobwhite and species of greatest conservation need at WLFW sites in southern Iowa. We are working closely with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, the USDA NRCS, and partners in Quail Forever/Pheasants Forever to conduct this work.

Our multi-disciplinary research team responded by developing foundational environmental and ecological knowledge required to build a robust strategy. To date, we have identified factors influencing where species occur, their abundance, and key drivers of reproduction<sup> </sup>influenced by two major sources of environmental change\u2014climate and land use change\u2014for three representative species (<i>E. wightmanae, E. britonni, </i>and<i> E. antillensis</i>). For this next research stage we propose to: 1) characterize the ability of the three representative species plus the endangered <i>E. juanriveroi,</i> to cope with environmental stresses (i.e. their <i>adaptive capacity</i>) using a combination of laboratory and field experiments, 2) map the genetic structure of these species to learn about connections between different populations and identify centers of genetic diversity, and 3) assist agencies in the development of conservation strategies centered on two potential adaptation actions: species relocations to new habitats (i.e. translocations) and making connections to climate-resilient habitats. By investigating the most effective ways to carry out translocations, we will help decision makers answer WHEN it is best to begin consideration of translocations versus continuing to manage at existing locations. And by investigating which habitats have the potential to be resilient in a changing climate, we will help decision makers answer WHERE the best 'areas of conservation interest' would be for translocated individuals.

Finally, as a precursor and illustration of the endpoint of the project, we constructed a decision framework for the conservation of <i>E. juanriveroi</i>, one of the two endangered species.

The strategy will enable decision makers to address the temporal and spatial components of recovery and pre-listing efforts. By incorporating translocations/introductions, decision makers address the question of WHEN to invest in <i>in-situ</i> management as opposed to translocations/introductions. The second component help guide decision makers to determine WHERE to translocate/introduce individuals, effectively informing decisions about strategic habitat conservation by creating scenario maps, a list of candidate \"areas of conservation interest\" that could serve as introduction sites and climatic <i>refugia</i> to enhance recovery/delisting of endangered species or prevent listing of at-risk species. | | |[ Visualizing Obstacles in Big Game Migration Corridors ](/coopunits/project/226210785280/gregory.nickerson) | June 2022 || Research shows that elk encounter many obstacles during their migrations.

This recovery has much to teach us about managing modern migrations, but the bison migration story has never been consolidated in one place. Although numerous studies have evaluated where bison move to their summer and winter ranges, a comprehensive picture of the history of their migration recovery has yet to be created.

Recent and dramatic increases in bison using northern areas and decreases in bison using central areas has raised concern that management removals have targeted the central breeding herd. Bison are managed under an Interagency Management Plan that limits population abundance and distribution. Under this plan, limited numbers of bison are allowed to migrate out of the park during winter with the remainder lethally removed when migrating beyond park boundaries. Based on counts during 2017, numbers of bison using central areas of the park may no longer be sufficient for long-term genetic conservation. However, there is some indication that the historic herd structure has broken down over time. If this is the case, with bison conforming to a single, intermixing population, then the current bison population is likely sufficiently large for long-term genetic conservation - although there are substantially fewer bison observed in central areas of the park. GPS data collected by the NPS from adult female bison during 2003-2018 will be organized and shared with the recipient. Using these data, the recipient will complete a network analysis identifying nodes representing breeding areas and winter areas and edges representing connections among breeding and wintering areas between seasons and years. The NPS will also organize and share genetic information from a subset of the individuals used in the network analysis.

Recent data have suggested that Yellow Perch and Walleye recruitment are affected by similar environmental factors, but declining trends in Yellow Perch recruitment success may have gone undetected due to lack of targeted sampling. Additionally, a lower abundance of juvenile Yellow Perch could be related to Walleye recruitment success. The objectives of this study are to determine if the following differ between lakes with different Walleye recruitment histories (sustained vs. declined): 1) density and spatial distribution of zooplankton prey; 2) relative importance of larval Yellow Perch and zooplankton to larval and post-larval Walleye diets; and 3) trends in age-0 Yellow Perch abundance.

Climate change further challenges this paradigm by rearranging the mosaic of fishing opportunities on the landscape with unpredictable implications for anglers and fish populations. Considering these complex dynamics as a paired social-ecological system (SES) can help predict fisheries responses to ecosystem change and develop management strategies to meet stakeholder objectives. Bluegill are one of the most important species in North America in terms of providing accessible, harvest-oriented recreational fisheries. Significant knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of ecological drivers of bluegill population dynamics, how bluegill fisheries may respond to climate change, and how anglers will respond to changes in bluegill populations and their management. Filling these gaps will promote the development of management strategies to prevent problems like stunting (i.e., high abundances of small fish) or growth overfishing. <i>We propose to develop an SES model to inform the management of bluegill (</i>Lepomis macrochirus<i>) across the Midwest US in the face of climate change.</i> We will leverage extensive datasets on bluegill growth across the Midwest to develop statistical and process-based models to determine important factors structuring bluegill populations and predict their responses to climate change impacts. Angler behavior will be quantified using creel survey data and in-person and email discrete choice experiments to evaluate angler heterogeneity in responses to changes in bluegill fisheries and local fishing opportunities. Finally, an SES model will be developed and parameterized for Midwest bluegill fisheries using information on bluegill population dynamics and angler behavior acquired during the first two stages of this project. The SES model will be used to predict the effects of climate change on bluegill fishery outcomes and identify management strategies that best provide robust bluegill populations, satisfied anglers, and diverse angling opportunities. These results will elucidate currently unknown dynamics in bluegill fisheries and allow managers to develop best management practices for bluegill fisheries facing the uncertain impacts of climate change. || Recreational fisheries management must balance the influences of ecological factors (e.g., environmental variation), social factors (e.g., angler behavior), and their interactions (e.g., angler responses to natural variation in fish populations) when developing strategies to produce and maintain resilient and productive fisheries. Considering these complex dynamics as a paired social-ecological system (SES) can help predict fisheries responses to ecosystem change and develop management strategies to meet stakeholder objectives. This project is a collaboration with the Center for Limnology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Bluegill are one of the most important species in North America in terms of providing accessible, harvest-oriented recreational fisheries. Significant knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of ecological drivers of bluegill population dynamics, how bluegill fisheries may respond to climate change, and how anglers will respond to changes in bluegill populations and their management. Filling these gaps will promote the development of management strategies to prevent problems like stunting (i.e., high abundances of small fish) or growth overfishing. | | |[ Adaptive Management with AMMonitor ](/coopunits/project/226147444736/lclarfeld) | August 2025 || Adaptive management (AM) is a cyclical process that improves natural resource management and generates knowledge that can inform future decisions.

Most ecosystems worldwide are impacted by human activities; yet the effects of human activities across scales are not adequately represented by existing ecosystem models. This is especially true for models of aquatic carbon (C) cycling and fluxes. Only recently has the magnitude of fluvial C fluxes been recognized within the global carbon cycle; yet these estimates explicitly ignore the influence of human activities, such as urbanization. We propose to assess urbanization effects on dissolved organic carbon (DOC)\u2014the largest flux of carbon in streams\u2014focusing on how urbanization affects ecosystems in regionally-specific ways. <u>We hypothesize that human activities introduce novel sources of ecological variability and affect the spatial and temporal scales of ecological processes differently in different geographies and urban contexts</u>. We will test this hypothesis using a comparative approach to understand urban effects on DOC. We will collect data on DOC quality and dynamics at 600 sites across five urban study areas to develop a multi-scale understanding of the quantity and quality of DOC in urban systems. We will use spatial statistics and time-series analyses to identify key spatio-temporal characteristics of human development (e.g., wastewater infrastructure, housing density) and biophysical factors (e.g., discharge, precipitation, canopy cover) that control the concentration, characteristics, and bioavailability of DOC. Our research takes a <i><u>novel approach</u></i> to jointly consider how the human and ecological dimensions of ecosystem ecology interact to control the quality, quantity, and timing of DOC entering watersheds across the continent. || Rivers and the landscapes through which they flow vary widely in both human factors (e.g., wastewater infrastructure, housing density, impervious surfaces) and biophysical factors (e.g., discharge, precipitation, temperature, canopy cover). Over a 12-month period, 100 sites in the Charles, Mystic, and Neponset Rivers in the Boston urban area will be sampled to determine how human and biophysical factors and their interactions influence dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and stream function. Sampling locations in tributaries and rivers are being selected to reflect gradients in factors such as canopy cover, housing density, environmental justice communities, age of development, impervious land cover, and wastewater infrastructure. This project is a collaboration between USGS and University scientists, along with local partners. Together with samples collected in four other urban areas (Atlanta, GA; Miami, FL; Salt Lake City, UT; Portland, OR), these data will lead to better understanding of human and biophysical controls on DOC across urban rivers and provide important information for carbon budgets and river management. | | |[ Landscape drivers of freshwater mussel assemblages and imperiled species status: implications for optimal allocation of conservation effort within the Delaware River Basin ](/coopunits/project/226138492928/askorupa) | May 2023 || The Delaware River provides an ideal case study for developing a basin-wide conservation strategy for imperiled freshwater mussels in the North Atlantic-Appalachian Region. The watershed contains 12 species of Atlantic slope mussels (Blakeslee<i> et al.</i> 2018), including the federally endangered Dwarf Wedgemussel and the at-risk Brook Floater. Nearly 15 million people depend on its water supply, and propagation of freshwater mussels is actively being pursued by conservation groups to aid water quality improvements in the estuary. The variation in dominant stressors throughout the basin, from environmental flow issues in the upper basin to water quality issues and saltwater intrusion in the lower basin, coincide with documented shifts in mussel community composition (Blakeslee<i> et al.</i> 2018). These complexities require a deliberative and transparent process to identify robust and collaborative conservation strategies. Our research activities will help foster a basin-wide perspective on mussel conservation and identify collaborative strategies for implementation by federal, state, and non-governmental groups working in the Delaware. The approach to assessing threats and prioritizing actions will be transferable to other watersheds with similar mussel assemblages. <br><br>The overarching goal of this project is to develop a framework to inform decisions on the allocation of conservation effort across potential actions and watersheds to advance freshwater mussel conservation in the Delaware River Basin.

Bog Turtle populations are still vulnerable to decline and further imperilment. Further, the Bog Turtle is listed as \"Endangered\" under the Massachusetts Endangered Species Act (MESA) and its implementing regulations. The Massachusetts Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program (NHESP) of the Division of Fisheries and Wildlife (MassWildlife) has partnered with six other state wildlife agencies (Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut) on a Competitive State Wildlife Grant (CSWG) to implement a regional Conservation Plan (Erb 2019) that was also developed with CSWG funds. At present, there are only two known occupied Bog Turtle sites in Massachusetts (Sites A and B). At least two additional sites are believed to be historic localities for Bog Turtles in Massachusetts. Incidental observations, available habitat, and regional patterns in adjacent New York and Connecticut indicate that there are likely areas of Bog Turtle occurrence in Massachusetts that are not currently known. This project is intended to support regional conservation planning efforts in coordination with adjacent and northeastern states, to document the spatial ecology of known populations, and to more fully document the distribution of the species in Massachusetts.<br><br>Our primary objective as a seven-state collaborative funded through CSWG is to protect and maintain the Northern Population of Bog Turtle and its habitat through implementation of high priority conservation actions identified in a 2001 recovery plan, the individual state Wildlife Action Plans, and a recently developed (funded via a prior Competitive State Wildlife Grant #F16AP00001) Bog Turtle Conservation Plan for the Northern Population (Erb 2001). Specifically in Massachusetts, our primary objectives are to document the distributional extent of the species in the Commonwealth, identify areas of potential habitat for restoration and/or surveys, to conduct habitat management, and to monitor the effects of habitat management while contributing data and information to the USFWS, the regional conservation planning effort, and the state's endangered species program. || The Northern population of Bog turtle has been federally listed as a threatened species since 1997 and is listed as \"Endangered\" under the Massachusetts Endangered Species Act. There are two known sites currently occupied by Bog turtles within the state, with two additional sites believed to have been historically occupied. As the species continues to face threats of habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation the populations of the two known sites have been studied on a 10-year rotation since the early 2000's with supporting research being conducted since the 1980's. The overall goals of this project are to examine the current population status within the known sites, habitat available at each site, extent of habitat used, and search for other potentially occupied sites. This project is a collaboration with the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife and The Nature Conservancy. As one of the longest-running studies on the species, these data will contribute to a regional database to help inform priority habitat management projects for the Bog turtle. | | |[ Rethinking lake management for invasive plants under future climate: Sensitivity of lake ecosystems to winter water level drawdowns ](/coopunits/project/226138132480/akumar1) | December 2023 || Small lakes are important to local economies as sources of water supply and places of recreation. Commonly, lakes are considered more desirable for recreation if they are free of the thick weedy vegetation, often comprised of invasive species, that grows around the lake edge; this vegetation makes it difficult to launch boats and swim. In order to reduce this vegetation, a common technique in the US northeast and midwest is a 'winter drawdown' (WD). In a WD, the lake level is artificially lowered (via controls in a dam) during the winter to expose shoreline vegetation to freezing conditions, thereby killing them and preserving recreational value of the lake. However, this practice can impact water quality (including prevalence of harmful algal blooms) and native aquatic plants and animals in lakes. Moreover, studies show that WDs are not always effective at killing nuisance and invasive plants. Almost no research has been done to study how WDs interact with climate; wet years, droughts, and heavy snow winters will all have different effects on the effectiveness of the WD at killing vegetation and the impacts on lake ecosystems. This research will specifically investigate WD standard practices and understand how, when, and why WDs can be better managed in differing climates. Further, we will map WD lakes across the entire northeast and midwest regions for the first time, providing policy makers with a first-ever estimate of the total number of WD lakes, the total amount of water released by these lakes (via new hydrology models we will build), and the prevalence of harmful algal blooms. This research will give state and local governments and lake managers a much-needed scientific basis for managing lakes, to ideally to optimize water quality and macrophytes for both human use and ecosystem integrity under future climates. || Human acceleration of eutrophication through continued watershed and lakeshore development, combined with changes in temperature and climate, increasingly challenges managers to meet human needs while protecting aquatic resources. While annual winter water level drawdowns (WDs) are commonly used to reduce nuisance macrophyte biomass, the future utility and impacts to ecosystems under climate change remains uncertain. Moreover, the timing and magnitude of drawdowns, which are influenced by climate, affect the negative impacts of drawdowns on lake ecosystems and water quality, including harmful algal blooms. Using remote sensing data, validated with on-the-ground water level and cyanobacteria data, <i>we will characterize water level fluctuations and cyanobacteria blooms in WD lakes coupled to novel hydrologic models that assess sensitivity of WDs and vulnerability of cyanobacteria blooms to future climate and precipitation. </i>The results from this research, which will be shared in scientific publications and online data repositories, will help evaluate WDs as a macrophyte management tool under future climate change and weigh any remaining benefits with the ecological and socioeconomic costs of performing WDs. This research is a collaboration between the USGS, UMass Amherst, USEPA, and seven state agencies, who will provide in-kind support for compilation and collection of field data and translate results into guidance for lake managers. | | |[ Quantifying the effect of resource partitioning by stocked salmonids on feeding dynamics of walleye in the Upper North Platte Reservoirs ](/coopunits/project/226137536512/awalter8) | June 2024 || Pathfinder Reservoir and Alcova Reservoir (Upper North Platte Reservoirs; UNPR) maintain important recreational fisheries for Walleye Trout (BNT), Rainbow Trout (RBT), Kokanee Salmon (KOE), and Cutthroat Trout (CUT). WAE recruitment is maintained through natural reproduction, while recruitment of salmonids (other than BNT) is primarily driven by stocking, though some natural reproduction does occur. In several recent years, WGFD spring gillnet surveys in Pathfinder Reservoir suggest near 100% mortality of salmonids stocked the previous fall. Similar surveys in Alcova Reservoir suggest reliable and stable recruitment of stocked salmonids following their first winter, although it varies by species. WGFD biologists suspect WAE predation on newly-stocked salmonids (SSD) is the primary driver of stocking failures; however, verifying this hypothesis and quantifying the seasonal magnitude of WAE consumption of SSD is required to develop and evaluate alternative management actions. The goals of this proposed work are to 1) quantify the extent and timing of WAE consumption of SSD in the NPR, and 2) to evaluate how resource use by SSD post-stocking affects the vulnerability of SSD to WAE predation. WAE, SSD, and other fish species will be sampled during the open water period using experimental gill nets, midwater curtain gill nets, and nearshore sampling gears (electrofishing, trapnets, seines) to quantify population demographics (relative abundance, age/size structure), foraging dynamics (stomach content and stable isotope analyses), and indices of condition. These data will be integrated with temperature data and coarse estimates of low, medium, and high population size into a bioenergetics model to estimate consumption of stocked SSD by WAE. Estimates of consumption will be compared to SSD resource use and stocking rates to assess the relative importance of WAE predation as a source of mortality for different SSD species. Results from this project will provide the WGFD with an improved understanding of the timing and magnitude of WAE consumption of SSD in the UNPR. This information will inform harvest regulations for WAE, SSD, and other fish species, and could guide development of a future SSD stocking evaluation to identify best practices to maximize survival post-stocking (e.g., composition, fish size, density, location, and timing).

Informal comparisons across boundaries have revealed that YLM populations occur in a variety of habitats throughout its range. However, little is known about the microhabitats that exist within the Connecticut River or their association with YLM. Mapping these fine-scale habitat features using side-scan sonar could illuminate this relationship. A goal of this project is to associate habitat characteristics within the Connecticut River and YLM presence/absence. A highly-accurate, fine-scale habitat assessment using side-scan sonar could be invaluable for land managers within the Connecticut River watershed and beyond.<br>An understanding of host fish for YLM is also essential for understanding the species' historic and current distribution and developing conservation plans. Striped Bass (<i>Morone saxatilis</i>) is a piscivorous fish that may be a suitable host for YLM; it is closely related to a confirmed host fish species. Observations of YLM glochidial infestation in wild populations of Striped Bass with a large sample size, combined with successful encystment and metamorphosis in laboratory conditions, would confirm this species as a viable host fish. This would have important implications for the conservation of YLM, with Striped Bass serving as a critical source of dispersal across species for the USFWS and has been designated as endangered or another special status in many states, including MA and CT. Yellow Lampmussel populations occur in a variety of habitats throughout its range; the species inhabits a variety of substrates and flow conditions, suggesting impacts by different stressors.

Population models require spatial replication over the study area of interest and temporal replicates that are independent but close enough in time to ensure population closure. The proposed study would use trap and video count data to estimate detection probability and abundance of red snapper with an integrated populaiton model fitted in a Bayesian framework. Covariates that influence red snapper detection probability and abundance will be used to predict abundance (with associated uncertainty) at habitats that are similar to SEFIS sampling sites but not sampled. We will conduct workshops with reef fishery stakeholders to assist with identification of non-sampled hard bottom habitats. Based on past work, covariates important to red snapper abundance are likely to include bottom temperature, depth, latitude, and substrate type. A key question with this work is the spatial area that an individual SEFIS trap and video station effectively samples. Recently, project collaborators measured the response of red snapper around baited traps using fine spatial scale telemetry data, and response distance information will be used to estimate the sampled area at trap stations. Red snapper densities derived from ROV surveys will also be estimated at habitat types generally not sampled by SEFIS. Spatial maps of important covariates and habitat type will be used to generate abundance by area across the study region. These individual abundance values would be summed to estimate abundance of red snapper (with associated uncertainty) in the US Atlantic. || Previously collected trap and video data, along with ROV survey data, will be used to estimate red snapper abundance within an integrated population modeling framework.

The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) is faced with an increased number of interactions between humans and deer in areas of high human and/or deer density, and these interactions often have negative outcomes (e.g., vehicle collisions). There is limited understanding across this continuum of public perceptions and desires of deer and deer hunting, along with little data on deer movements, density, recruitment, survival, and causes of mortality, or how hunting (the primary herd management tool) affects deer populations. Additionally, harvest and survey trends used to monitor herds across county or management zones are confounded by unknown hunter effort and success in these expanding urban/suburban areas. This project aims to increase understanding of spatial and temporal variation in white-tailed deer ecology across an urban-rural continuum in North Carolina and how harvest regulations affect white-tailed deer herds across these landscapes. Results will be available to help evaluate current NCWRC programs (Urban Archery Season, Community DMAP, depredation permits) and adjust or create new programs. Information can also be used to provide technical guidance to municipalities, landowners, and hunters. Results will be applicable to areas across the state and will have implications for other urban-rural areas across the state and country. || Urban/suburban areas continue to spread into rural areas, increasing the need to understand deer ecology and assess the cultural impacts of deer and deer hunting across the urban-rural continuum.

Currently, greater than 10% of the earth's land surface is categorized as 'urban cover' and that area is continually growing. By 2050, 70% of the human population is expected to live in cities, which now constitute one of the 'newest and fastest growing' ecosystems in the world. In North Carolina, black bear populations occupy nearly two-thirds of the state and their range continues to expand, including into areas with high densities of people and road networks. Humans and black bears are now living in greater proximity to each other, resulting in increased human-bear interactions and some areas of the state may have reached or exceeded the social carrying capacity. Continued investigations into the fine-scale spatial and behavioral ecology of black bears in urban environments is warranted. For example, the identification of characteristics associated with bear-vehicle mortality along major interstates will help identify habitat characteristics associated with collision, and thus may aid in reducing collisions with vehicles. Additionally, in source-sink dynamics, wildlife populations that have access to high quality habitat typically have birth rates that are greater than death rates and surplus individuals disperse from the population as emigrants. In contrast, sink populations have low habitat quality, or suitability, and thus experience death rates that exceed birth rates and the population could decline towards extinction (i.e., a sink), unless 'rescued' by immigration from surrounding source populations. We will evaluate family group dynamics and estimate population growth rates and population dynamics. Clearly, these objectives have direct and indirect consequences for humans and bears in our rapidly changing urban environments. || Cities now constitute one of the most rapidly growing ecosystems in the world, and with the global spotlight on increasing urbanization and development, the focus on wildlife in 'natural' systems is sharing importance with a focus on wildlife in urban systems, providing unique research opportunities in ecology and conservation.

The MN Unit will support a national-scale effort to track bats and coronaviruses through the North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat). The NABat program was established in 2015 to provide reliable information on where North American bats occur and how their populations respond to current and future threats. Now in 2021, the NABat human infrastructure has grown to include a network of more than 160 partnering organizations including Federal, State, Tribal, and non-governmental organizations, community scientists and private industry collecting and submitting data across 49 US States and 8 Canadian provinces. NABat Monitoring Hubs help coordinate regional data collection efforts, provide technical assistance, and actionable science to local partners.<br> <br>This work will provide an intense wildlife coronavirus surveillance effort conducted in partnership with Federal, State, Tribal, and non-governmental organization partners. Data obtained from coronavirus surveillance in bats and the environment will be used to model SARS-CoV-2 occurrence patterns and understand the role of wildlife and the environment in human COVID-19 infection dynamics. Data will also be collected on the human dimensions of the issue and how human perception and behavior influences risk. This will inform risk assessments on viral transfer between human and wildlife populations and would inform actions to help prevent or minimize recurrence of outbreaks in the future.<br> <br>Bats are the evolutionary reservoir of diverse beta and alpha coronaviruses, including SARS-like coronaviruses. Betacoronaviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 have been isolated in Rhinolophid bats in China, but relatively little is known about the diversity of coronaviruses in North American bat species. The scientific consensus remains that bats are the most likely reservoir host of SARS-Cov-2 and that human and bat contact is the most likely scenario for a spillover event that led to the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding viral diversity, including and especially coronaviruses, in bats has profound implications for ensuring wildlife and human health and preparing for future zoonotic disease spilllover events. Furthermore, bats are known reservoirs of rabies virus and globally are known to be the reservoir hosts of other viruses that are highly pathogenic in humans, including Nipah virus and Hendra virus. Collection of guano from winter and summer colonies and swabbing of live bats would allow assessing viral diversity and loads, furthering our understanding of coronavirus and other potentially pathogenic viruses in North American bats. To compliment these data,<br> <br>To date, empirical evidence is lacking on the prevalence of coronaviruses in naturally occurring populations of North American bats. This work will leverage and bolster the existing NABat collaborative monitoring network so that we can better track and predict occurrence of coronaviruses in North American bats.

Very limited knowledge exists about key public stakeholders' (e.g., hunters, anglers, birdwatchers) perception of the conditions resulting from climate change to fish and wildlife resources or their preference for adaptation strategies to these changes. This limited understanding of public preferences has also impeded early, intensive interventions by resource managers to improve conservation outcomes. Recent research suggests that presentation of the uncertainty of consequences as well as information about the potential benefits of strategies can affect the trust the public has in information as well as preference for adaptation strategies and the malleability of those preference. We will use social psychological experiments embedded in online social surveys to clarify relationships among uncertainty, trust, preference, and key characteristics of respondents. Project reports, information workshops, and presentations will be provided and stored digitally on a project website for peer scientists at universities as well as fish and wildlife managers at state and federal agencies, tribes, and non-governmental organizations.

Very little is known about public attitudes or risk perceptions concerning the use of genetic modifications for aquatic invasive species control. The purpose of this proposed project is to better describe public understanding and attitudes towards the use of advance genetic modification techniques as control tools for invasive species. To thoroughly address the purpose, this research must investigate attitudes towards these techniques within the context of specifically understanding attitudes toward the invasive species and their impacts. Recent research on the human and social dimensions of invasive species provides guidance for the design of the proposed research. Although a robust literature concerning the human and social dimensions of invasive species management and governance has developed, there is limited research specific to the use of genetic techniques to control invasive species. The study proposed here addresses that gap in research. This study represents a crucial upstream evaluation of public attitudes and perceptions that will enable subsequent engagement to develop governance in the use of genetic technology for these purposes in Minnesota. This project will provide baseline information about Minnesota residents' attitudes and risk perceptions toward genetic modification techniques as an approach for managing aquatic invasive species. The outcomes of this study include improving knowledge of the preferences and risk perceptions of using these techniques among the general population of Minnesota, tribal communities, and specific stakeholder and user groups such as anglers and boaters in the state. The focus will be on attitudes and risk perceptions toward using genetic modification to help control invasive species in general as well as two specific, widespread invasive species: common carp and zebra mussels. In addition, the project will help clarify the social psychological antecedents and consequences of these attitudes and risk perceptions. Focus groups and interviews will be used to assist survey design, and we will use mixed-modal surveys with web-based data collection. We will also implement a discrete choice experiment within the survey to better understand the attributes driving choices concerning the use of genetic technology. A total of 3,200 surveys are targeted for completion from the Minnesota general public, lakeshore homeowners, anglers, and boaters. The objectives of this study are: 1) to understand the attitudes, risk perceptions, and level of support for using genetic techniques in controlling two invasive aquatic species in Minnesota (e.g., common carp and zebra mussel); 2) to understand the antecedents/consequences to attitudes, risk perceptions, and level of support for using genetic techniques in these two specific cases; 3) to understand the general preferences for using genetic techniques in the management of invasive species in Minnesota, the antecedents/consequences of these preferences, and the population heterogeneity related to these preferences; 4) to explore and gain an initial understanding of potential concerns of tribal communities in Minnesota with using genetic techniques for invasive species control. || The objectives of this study are: 1) to understand the attitudes, risk perceptions, and level of support for using genetic techniques in controlling two invasive aquatic species in Minnesota (e.g., common carp and zebra mussel); 2) to understand the antecedents/consequences to attitudes, risk perceptions, and level of support for using genetic techniques in these two specific cases; 3) to understand the general preferences for using genetic techniques in the management of invasive species in Minnesota, the antecedents/consequences of these preferences, and the population heterogeneity related to these preferences; 4) to explore and gain an initial understanding of potential concerns of tribal communities in Minnesota with using genetic techniques for invasive species control. | | |[ Assessing the motivations and constraints of lapsed small game hunters ](/coopunits/project/226125731840/stev1009) | June 2022 || Rates of hunting participation are declining across the United States (U.S. Department of Interior, 2016). This decline has implications for the long-term financial health of state wildlife agencies that principally rely on hunting license revenues to support both game and non-game management activities. Consequently, understanding the factors that shape citizens' patterns of participation in hunting, preferences and interest in hunting, and constraints to long-term engagement is critical for ensuring the current funding model employed by the agencies, fostering citizens' connection to outdoor heritage, and wildlife conservation moreover. Growing emphasis has been placed on activities to recruit, retain, and re-engage hunters and anglers. However, limited scientific scrutiny has been directed toward these activities. Hunter recruitment and retention activities are enhanced with and understanding of the needs, preferences and differences of a diverse target population. For instance, constraints to participation in outdoor recreation have been shown to vary as a function of a variety of lifecourse attributes and socio-demographics including having children, household income, health, age, access to transport and social supports. Understanding the role of these factors, and others, in shaping citizens' patterns of participation in hunting is critical for effective program design and outreach. Lapsed hunters, defined as individuals that have hunted in the past but have since ceased participation, are a demographic of particular interest for outreach efforts given their apparent existing interest in hunting generally. Enticing these individuals to return to hunting by facilitating the needed social, institutional and economic supports could be an effective strategy for bolstering participation. However, limited scientifically valid knowledge exists regarding the factors that cause hunters to otherwise cease participation, or strategies for alleviating these causes. The objective of this project is to conduct a survey to assess the factors that cause hunters to cease participation in small game hunting including social, economic and institutional constraints, and their likelihood to return to hunting. || Lapsed hunters, defined as individuals that have hunted in the past but have since ceased participation, are a demographic of particular interest for outreach efforts given their apparent existing interest in hunting generally.

In this study, we will conduct a survey of Minnesotans' to support implementation of the 2011 Moose Management Plan, and generate data to inform an update to this plan slated to begin in FY22. Specific topics for assessment will emerge from deliberation with DNR staff and external partners during survey design. Potential topics for assessment include, Minnesotans' willingness to pay for moose viewing opportunities, perceptions of moose hunting and moose harvest, tradeoffs in moose, wolf, and deer management in moose range, and preferences for the DNRs approach to moose management among others.

Gillnetting was implemented in 1995 to suppress the lake trout population, but despite annual increases in gillnetting effort, the population expanded throughout Yellowstone Lake and increased in abundance until 2012, when the effort became large enough to curtail population growth [2]. The lake trout population of Yellowstone Lake is highly resilient to gillnetting, probably because of high early life history survival. Interstitial embryo predators, which are a common source of embryo mortality in the native range of lake trout, do not inhabit Yellowstone Lake. || <b>Background</b><br> <br>Yellowstone Lake has been the site of intensive efforts to conserve native Yellowstone cutthroat trout <i>Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri</i> and restore natural ecological function since invasive lake trout <i>Salvelinus namaycush</i> were first discovered there in 1994 [1]. Gillnetting was implemented in 1995 to suppress the lake trout population, but despite annual increases in gillnetting effort, the population expanded throughout Yellowstone Lake and increased in abundance until 2012, when the effort became large enough to curtail population growth [2]. The lake trout population of Yellowstone Lake is highly resilient to gillnetting, probably because of high early life history survival. Interstitial embryo predators, which are a common source of embryo mortality in the native range of lake trout, do not inhabit Yellowstone Lake.<br> <br> <br><i>Lake Trout Benchmark</i><br>Although the suppression program has reduced adult (age 6+) lake trout by >80% since 2012, recruitment of young (age-2) lake trout has remained extremely high, suggesting a compensatory response [3]. Because of this, the age-2 lake trout have remained the most abundant age class and have consistently dominated the annual catches by the suppression program. For example, in 2020 a total of 326,000 lake trout were killed by gillnetting, of which 215,000 (66%) were age-2 fish. Although these pulses of young fish are removed from the population before reaching maturity, they represent a large portion of the population remaining annually within the lake [3]. At the end of the 2020 netting season, the total estimated lake trout abundance was 382,500, of which 302,500 were age-2 fish. Only 80,000 (21%) were fish older than age-2. The current lake trout population benchmark described in the 2010 conservation plan is 100,000 fish of all ages that are vulnerable to the gillnets (age-2 and older) [4]. Because the lake trout population will likely continue to be dominated by young fish, which generally do not prey upon cutthroat trout [5], it is possible the 2010 conservation plan benchmark could be revised to minimize the effect of the age-2 lake trout on perceived success (e.g., 100,000 lake trout age-3 and older; or consideration of biomass as a potential benchmark).<br> <br><i>Cutthroat Trout Benchmark</i><br>Cutthroat trout abundance in Yellowstone Lake declined precipitously until suppression efforts reached sufficient levels to reduce lake trout abundances in 2012 [6]. The number of cutthroat trout caught during annual long-term gillnetting assessments varied subsequently, with mean catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) varying from a low of 12.5 per 100-m net night in 2011 to highs of 27.3 and 26.4 in 2014 and 2018, respectively. Lake trout predation was associated with a long-term shift in cutthroat trout lengths from dominance by small (100-280 mm) and midsized (290-390 mm) individuals to dominance by large individuals (400+ mm) in annual gillnetting assessments. The mean CPUE of small and midsized cutthroat trout declined from 18.6 per 100-m net night and 15.1, respectively, in the 1980s to just 6.9 and 3.9, respectively in the 2010s [3]. Concurrently, the mean CPUE of large cutthroat trout nearly doubled, from 7.5 in the 1980s to 14.6 in the 2010s. Lake trout also caused increases in individual weights and condition of cutthroat trout. The average weight of midsized and large cutthroat trout increased from 408.0 g and 682.8 g, respectively, in the 1980s to 463.4 g and 1418.6 g, respectively, in the 2010s. Cutthroat trout abundance of all sizes remains below recovery benchmarks, but large individuals (> 400 mm) have become more abundant and individual weights have doubled, probably because of reduced density. A large (400+ mm) cutthroat trout in 2020 weighs twice what it did in 1980, prior to the lake trout invasion. Currently, the benchmarks for cutthroat trout recovery described in the 2010 conservation plan are all based upon abundance, and include gillnet CPUE, angler catch per hour, and spawner counts in streams [4]. There is a need to refine cutthroat trout recovery benchmarks to account for shifts to greater individual weights and population biomass. | | |[ Wildlife Resource Management on BLM Lands in Alaska ](/coopunits/project/226124072960/smcrimmins2) | September 2024 || The Wildlife Program of the Bureau of Land Management is responsible for wildlife and habitat maintenance, conservation, and restoration throughout much of Alaska.

Both inter- and intraspecific variation in body size are known to drive aspects of consumer resource use, and understanding patterns of resource use with increasing body size is important for understanding macroecological patterns of ecosystem structure. In addition to body size, patterns of consumption may be influenced by environmental heterogeneity. Abiotic factors may influence resource use directly through their effects on metabolism, performance, and visibility, or indirectly through their influence on prey availability, predator density, and prey refugia. Streams are an ideal system to test the effects of environmental heterogeneity on consumer resource use because abiotic and biotic characteristics vary along longitudinal gradients (the river continuum) and streams host diverse consumer communities that feed on a wide variety of resources.

Demand for stocking cool and coldwater fish species that support important fisheries will likely increase as a result of climate change, but fish available for stocking are a limited resource. Consequently, climate change is likely to affect the supply-and-demand tradeoffs associated with stocking fish in the future, where demand for fish is likely to exceed supply. We will examine these tradeoffs using walleye, which represent an ideal species for this assessment because they are a native coolwater species supporting economically- and socially-important fisheries across North America, stocking is already used to support or maintain many walleye fisheries, and walleye populations have already declined due to climate change, resulting in increased demand for stocked fish. Resource agencies routinely evaluate walleye stocking success and we will compile information from these evaluations to determine what factors are associated with stocking success. These factors are likely to include the size and number of walleye that are stocked, lake characteristics such as surface area and productivity, availability of both walleye prey and predators, length of growing season, and winter severity. Once these factors have been identified, we can forecast what stocking success might be for individual lakes in the future, given that climate change is likely to affect many factors that regulate stocking success. These projections will allow fishery biologists to compare the number of walleye needed to provide walleye fisheries in the face of climate change (i.e., demand) against the number of walleye that might be available for stocking (i.e., supply). Our work will allow agencies to adapt stocking strategies to ensure that walleye fishing opportunities remain available and to ensure that agency resources are expended in a manner that is biologically relevant yet cost effective. || Stocking is routinely used to supplement or maintain fisheries when natural recruitment is low or nonexistent.

We will examine these tradeoffs using walleye, which represent an ideal species for this assessment because they are a native coolwater species supporting economically- and socially-important fisheries across North America, stocking is already used to support or maintain many walleye fisheries, and walleye populations have already declined due to climate change, resulting in increased demand for stocked fish.<br>The project is a collaboration of researchers across multiple agencies and includes the US Geological Survey, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, University of Minnesota, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, and numerous Natural Resource agencies from the Midwest.<br>Projections will allow fishery biologists to compare the number of walleye needed to provide walleye fisheries in the face of climate change (i.e., demand) against the number of walleye that might be available for stocking (i.e., supply).

In 2019, a network of scientists launched Snapshot USA, a collaborative survey of terrestrial wildlife using cameras across the United States. Surveys in 2019 collected data at 1,509 camera sites within 110 camera arrays covering 12 different ecoregions across all 50 states In 2019, surveys were conducted over a 14-week period in the fall. This effort resulted in 166,036 detections of 83 species of mammals and 17 species of birds. Images were processed through the Smithsonian's eMammal data repository and included an expert review to ensure taxonomic accuracy. All survey data were made available in a recent data publication (Cove et al. 2021; Ecology). This project is a continuation and expansion of initial Snapshot USA, and creates a new camera array in the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge (Oklahoma). Data collected will be archived at the Smithsonian and made available for local and macroecological research including the examination of community assembly, effects of environmental and anthropogenic landscape variables, effects of fragmentation and extinction debt dynamics, as well as species-specific population dynamics and conservation action plans. || With the accelerating pace of global change, it is imperative that we obtain rapid inventories of the status and distribution of wildlife for ecological inferences and conservation planning.

The effects of WWE will also vary seasonally based on water temperature and discharge. We propose to monitor temperature from sites that characterize various effluent scenarios as a baseline for interpreting biological data (See Objective 2 below). These data will also serve as a temperature baseline for future monitoring and management of eastern Colorado transitional and warm water streams. <br> <br> <i>Approach:</i> <br> <br><b><i><u>Task 1</u></i></b>. We propose to meet with managers and scientists from Colorado Parks and Wildlife, other interested agencies, and WWTPs to determine appropriate field sites for monitoring temperature. Once sites are identified, we will deploy temperature-monitoring equipment. We will also and monitor stream discharge and basic water quality seasonally at the same sites. Stream discharge will be measured using standard USGS methods. Basic water quality data will include specific conductance, pH, water temperature, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen. We also propose to gather, collate, and summarize existing historical records for temperature from WWTP's and other groups that monitor temperature on eastern Colorado transitional and warm water streams. <br> <br><b><i><u>Task2.</u></i></b> To understand the influence of WWTP effluent on stream temperature it is important to consider the longitudinal aspects of water temperature (Figure 1). VerHoef and Peterson's (2010) spatial statistical network models are a well-recognized tool for analyzing stream attributes like temperature. The GIS tools and R script for implementing these models are available and have been used extensively in temperature modeling (Issak et al. 2014 and http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/SpatialStreamNetworks.shtml). We propose to analyze data collected in Task 1 using these models. <br> <br>Figure 1. Conceptual model of stream temperature measurement and modeling. The x-axis represents distance to and from a WWTP. The hashes on the x-axis represent locations of temperature monitors. The dashed line represents a temperature threshold and this could represent an important temperature for any biological activity (i.e. reproduction). The WWTP effluent raises the base stream temperature. In this example, the temperature decreases exponentially back to the base stream temperature. However, the relationship of stream temperature to distance downstream could be any function. In this example, the stream temperature returns to the threshold between two temperature monitors. If the function is known, then the spatial location of the event can be identified, as well as the uncertainty of that location. The same modeling can be done with other events, such as return to base temperature. Covariates that effect the shape of the function can also be included (i.e. air temperature, discharge, land cover). <br> <br> <br><u>Objective 2.

However, inferences that are more detailed can be made using histology and histology is an effective tool to study the reproductive cycle in fishes (Blazer 2002). It is routinely used for sex verification and assessing reproductive development (Blazer 2002). It can also be used to document abnormalities, such as intersex, and diseases, such as tumors and parasites (Blazer 2002).

Here, we will construct a hierarchical Bayesian model to account for imperfect pathogen detection and ambiguity in the white nose syndrome (WNS) system; our model will use surveillance data to improve forecasts of the invasion front, improve state-dependent decision making, and improve our ability to identify high priority areas for WNS surveillance. We foresee our model also improving the management and decision-making process of other pressing issues which benefit from early detection but are challenged by imperfect and ambiguous detections, including those related to invasive species, endangered species, and pathogen surveillance. || Management decisions for emerging infectious diseases, endangered species, and invasive species depend on the true state of the system and must be made quickly to maximize opportunities for mitigation.

Human-bear conflicts increased as bears became more abundant and expanded their range. Since 2002, harvest management of bears had aimed to stabilize bear population growth. However, harvest has not achieved desired goals. As a results, additional seasons and extended season lengths were implemented in 2019. Our objectives are to understand how changes to the bear harvest seasons impact female bear space use, survival, and harvest risk. This project is a collaboration between the USGS Oklahoma Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The results will be used to inform harvest management to ensure sustainable harvest and healthy bear populations. | | |[ Distribution, habitat selection, and survival of plains spotted skunks in South Dakota ](/coopunits/project/225875611648/kara.white) | June 2024 || The plains spotted skunk (<i>Spilogale interrupta</i>), is a recently recognized species and has been petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act.

However, positive effects of aquatic invasive species to on water-based recreational activities are possible.<br><br>The American paddlefish is a popular target among fishers on the Missouri River, which has thriving populations of bighead carp and silver carp (collectively referred to as \"bigheaded carp\"). Bigheaded carp, native to Asia, are invasive species in North America. It is likely that multiple ecological and sociological factors contribute to satisfaction of fishers targeting American paddlefish in the Missouri River.<br><br>To understand the influence of bigheaded carp on paddlefish-fishers' satisfactions, we are quantifying fishers' expectations and outcomes during archery and snagging seasons on two temporal scales\u2014day and season. Our <i>a priori </i>prediction was that the presence of bigheaded carp would positively influence satisfactions of fishers during archery season (by providing additional opportunities to shoot fish) and negatively influence satisfactions of fishers during snagging season (by increasing work, via bycatch of bigheaded carp, required to harvest an American paddlefish). Preliminary results are somewhat consistent with our prediction. The presence of bigheaded carp did enhance satisfactions of fishers during archer season, but did not diminish satisfactions of fishers during snagging season. || Abundances of invasive carps (Bighead Carp, Silver Carp) have steadily increased during the past several decades in a reach of the Missouri River below Gavins Point Dam, anecdotally negatively affecting anglers' satisfaction.

This provides hope that an effective control strategy might protect the state's white-tailed deer resource. This project will leverage existing MNDNR plans and infrastructure to control occurrence and distribution of CWD in Minnesota utilizing targeted removal of deer groups at locations where CWD positive deer have been found. The intent of the proposed work is to use agency culling as a fine-scale management tool to increase the likelihood of removing additional CWD positive animals from the affected landscape, reduce deer density around locations of CWD positive animals, and use genetic information from sampled deer to better understand social network structure of deer most likely exposed to CWD. Understanding familial relationship of culled deer will assist in understanding if related individual deer are being remove at designated removal sites. || <b>Problem Statement:</b> Social structure and the interactions among groups of conspecific individuals are important when considering the dynamics of disease transmission and potential means of disease management. White-tailed deer are known to associate in relatively stable matrilineal or dominant-female groups and female white-tailed deer generally associate more closely with relatives than with nonrelatives.<br><br><b>Why it matters: </b>We can bring this collective genetic information together by determining both haplotypes and pairwise relatedness in order to quantify social group membership at a fine spatial scale. More specifically we can quantify the numbers of close relatives of CWD positive deer removed from culling efforts and haplotype diversity among known CWD-infected deer.<br><br><b>Partners:</b><br>Dr. Christopher Jennelle, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Forest Lake, MN 55025<br><br><b>How it will be used:</b> These statistics can be used as a baseline for creating an index of the ability of agency culling efforts to remove high-risk social groups in a given spatial location. Another potential management application is to track this type of information for all deer harvested in close spatial proximity to CWD-positive detections to quantify the degree to which CWD exposed matrilines (a broader-scale proxy for infected social groups) are being removed from fine spatial scale locations. | | |[ Avian community response to grassland restoration at Rappahannock River Valley National Wildlife Refuge ](/coopunits/project/225805563904/eahunter) | April 2023 || Rappahannock River Valley National Wildlife Refuge (RRVNWR) in the tidewater of Virginia is a network of both remnant and restored grasslands (with more restorations planned).

The Valley's watersheds drain into Goose Lake \u2014 a slightly alkaline system that has historically dried up during severe drought years (e.g., 2015), and drains into the Pit River to the south during very high-flow years. There are several endemic fish species that occupy Goose Lake and its adjacent rivers, marshes, and riparian areas: the Goose Lake redband trout, Goose Lake lamprey, Goose Lake tui chub, and Goose Lake sucker. These endemic species coexist with a variety of native and non-native species. Because Goose Lake and its surrounding watershed are highly sensitive to drought conditions, an increased frequency of drought events in the region may limit the accessibility, quantity, and quality of available habitat for native fishes, thereby putting undue stress on vulnerable species. The goal of this project is to aid agency partners in conducting a population assessment for at-risk native species in Oregon's closed lakes basin ecosystem and to determine which systems are most at risk of declining populations due to disturbances such as drought and invasive species. This research is timely because consistent surveys have not been conducted in many of Oregon's high desert basins for more than a decade. Updated abundance and distribution estimates will inform state and federal managers as to the population status of at-risk native species, while the population risk assessment will support actionable management outcomes. || The Goose Lake Valley is an endorheic desert valley that runs north-to-south on the border of Oregon and California.

Through this work statement and other activities, SRP seeks to cultivate scientific understanding of connections between reservoir operations and ecosystem responses for select rivers in unique ecoregions around the United States. Development of scientific knowledge is leveraged through implementation of environmental flow prescriptions at reservoirs, which alters land-water interactions thereby stimulating ecosystem responses that can be studied and quantified using field monitoring protocols and analysis. If operational changes are studied, resulting knowledge can be used to improve prescriptions and perpetuate a culture of adaptive management. Monitoring does not need to be exhaustive to be effective and requires constructive, informative, and timely guidance from scientists in the field to dam operators. || This Research Work Order supports the data compilation to inform field science needs related to environmental flows and includes the necessary first step towards developing clear, updated, scientifically defensible conceptual frameworks and diagrams that can be shared with stakeholders and used to inform future scientific efforts, supporting the efforts of the Oregon Water Science Center. Specifically, general models of flow ecology relationships will be linked and existing information describing physical and biological conditions in the Willamette River and how these conditions are influenced by streamflow will be compiled and summarized in order to parameterize and test model performance. | | |[ Developing an Avian-based Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) Model for the Upper Tana Watershed, Kenya ](/coopunits/project/225486925824/cynthia.loftin) | May 2025 || The Biological Condition Gradient model (BCG) has been used as a simple standardized categorical assessment tool to guide protection and restoration decisions in aquatic and marine ecosystems.

These patterns are not always predictable, because they are the result of interactions with the other species present. The ponds within Acadia National Park have varied fish communities based on local conditions, stocking history, and fishing pressures. The resultant unique compositions, including native and introduced fishes, allows for the opportunity to examine both whether we observe consistent foodweb impacts for commonly invasive fishes and how those impacts are translating to effects on emergent aquatic insects available as subsidies to terrestrial fauna. || Ponds within Acadia National Park present a unique opportunity to leverage existing datasets while also aiding in their interpretation as they have been previously sampled in studies of mercury, as well as having repeated assessments of fish community composition. Lake conditions have also been studied for relationships with amphibian mortality. However, freshwater foodweb information, and the potential impacts of the suite of invasive fishes in the park, have yet to be studied in detail. By using CN stable isotopes we can trace both source and trophic level to reconstruct foodwebs for each pond that can be used to better understand the impacts of invasive fishes, establish baseline data for future research, and inform future fish management. For the proposed examination of freshwater foodwebs, in addition to outlining the existing foodweb structure, we will examine how impacts of invasive fishes may reach into neighboring terrestrial habitats, potentially impacting charismatic and conservation focused taxa such as birds. | | |[ Impacts of Egyptian Goose and other invasive aquatic avifauna ](/coopunits/project/224993585152/cproberts) | August 2023 || Globally, invasive species are one of the biggest drivers of biodiversity and agricultural losses.

The cause of that decline is not well understood but is thought to be caused in part by the loss of large contiguous emergent wetland habitat they rely on for breeding. In Arkansas, King Rail abundance and distribution are unknown, and the one site on public land in the Arkansas Delta that hosts multiple pairs, the Freddie Black Choctaw West WMA (hereafter Choctaw West WMA), also represents a dramatic wetland restoration success that is critical to learn from. Here, we propose to use the Choctaw West WMA as a focal site to 1) evaluate King Rail breeding site fidelity, 2) evaluate King Rail breeding locations, and 3) compare King Rail habitat and abundance to other sites across the Arkansas Delta. We will capture and mark with transmitters spring migrating and breeding King Rails at Choctaw West WMA to evaluate the habitat use of individual birds at Choctaw West WMA as well as the connectivity of the site with the rest of the annual cycle (farther north breeding areas, and southern wintering areas). We will also conduct marsh bird surveys within the Choctaw West WMA and across the Arkansas Delta to quantify King Rail distribution and abundance and compare regional habitat and landscape attributes to Choctaw West WMA attributes.

Tracking CWD as it progressed across the US since it's discovery in the early 1980s has been hampered because studies of distinct strains of CWD has been lacking. Identification of distinct prion strains can inform management by targeting areas known to harbor CWD, thus prioritizing management of cervid populations with prion strains that have greater infection potential and those that are able to infect new species. Although the biology of prions has been well studied (they are responsible for mad cow disease), prion researchers have been unable to study prion strains throughout the US because samples have not been available for study. Therefore, a virtual repository to link CWD tissue sample locations would provide this important resource to researchers to aid management agencies in the US. || <b>Problem Statement:</b> The overall goal of this program is to establish a national CWD tissue and reagents repository.<br><br><b>Why it matters: </b>The significance of this program is multifold. First, a repository of CWD field isolates from a wide-ranging geographic location in North America will allow, for the first time, the means to begin to assess the distribution and frequency of CWD strains in North America. Since prion strains can differ in pathogenicity and host range, this is essential data for the determination for risk of interspecies prion transmission to humans and to domestic livestock and wildlife. Second, this repository can provide uniform standardized CWD-infected and uninfected sources of tissue for diagnostic development, mitigation testing and for basic research purposes. Finally, the implementation of the repository will facilitate cooperation between the various state agencies that could lead to new collaborative efforts.<br><br><b>Partners:</b><br>Jason Bartz<i>, </i>Medical Microbiology and Immunology, 68178<br><br><b>How it will be used: </b>This virtual repository will be accessible by researchers throughout the world to request samples to achieve study objectives involving prion strain type and prion protein genotypes. Important metadata will be linked to each tissue type that would include: coordinates for collection location, species, sex, age, tissue type (e.g. retropharyngeal lymph node, obex), prion protein genotype, physical location of stored sample, and contact information of organization housing the sample. All of this metadata for each tissue sample will be housed in a single virtual repository accessible to researchers throughout the world. | | |[ Linking Genetics to Movements of White-tailed deer to Assist Surveillance for CWD Epidemiology ](/coopunits/project/223948226560/jee5023) | August 2024 || Surveillance for chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer is often in response to finding a new disease foci with direction of surveillance controlled by some arbitrary distanced buffer around a diseased animal. Understanding large-scale gene flow across a region can identify the most likely transmission path of CWD because gene flow identifies historic ancestry of deer across a landscape.

Despite reintroduction efforts in the 1980s, ptarmigan are now functionally extirpated from the southernmost portion of their historic range, located in northern New Mexico. Due to a lack of monitoring, the causes of extirpation remain unclear, and could be attributed to climate change, geographic isolation, or other unknown causes. This study will evaluate the demographic outcomes of a newly-reintroduced ptarmigan population from Colorado. The study will also compare habitat selection patterns as well as chick diet composition and growth rates with ptarmigan populations in Colorado. The information collected in this study will be central to informing future reintroduction efforts in both New Mexico and other portions of the species range where they are now extirpated (e.g. ,Wyoming), and guide management and conservation efforts of New Mexico Department of Game and Fish and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife in future species status assessments. || Climate change is predicted to contract the distribution of alpine species that are limited in their ability to disperse to suitable habitats. The white-tailed ptarmigan is an alpine-obligate species that is currently extirpated from portions of its historic range, including its southern periphery in northern New Mexico.

Landscape genetics combines population genetic (using DNA sequence variation) and landscape ecology analyses to address this question. However, a DNA sequence only approach ignores the differences in relative expression of genes that also differ between populations, and importantly, covaries with variables such as stress or other physiological responses. These snapshots of gene expression patterns (\"transcriptomes\") add key information about an organism's condition. We believe it is time for a new field of \"landscape transcriptomics\". Landscape transcriptomics could address similar questions as landscape genetics, but also tackle issues such as how landscape features affect stress and health of populations. This project will develop this field with a focus on applications to fisheries conservation and management, response of organisms to rapidly changing environments, and response of bee populations to nutritional resources, parasites, and pesticides. || Species genetic diversity, persistence, and adaptive potential are all affected by the degree of connectivity between habitat patches and the characteristics of those patches, whether it be water temperature for fish or flower species diversity for bees. To better inform management and conservation efforts and provide insights about adaptation potential, it is important to know not only how populations differ from one another across the landscape, but also how populations differ in their response to dynamic environmental conditions. Examining a snapshot of the whole genome gene expression (a transcriptome) is one way to accomplish this need. However, currently there is not a formal field in ecology that explicitly explores the benefits, limits, and quantitative challenges associated with this approach at landscape scales. This project will develop this new subdiscipline of ecology, which we refer to as landscape transcriptomics. This research will be performed with partners from Penn State University, USGS, and other academic institutions. | | |[ Effects of recreational disturbance on desert bighorn sheep in western Colorado ](/coopunits/project/212001343488/adevans) | June 2025 || Responses by large herbivores to human disturbance can result in a change in their habitat use, movements, and increased vigilance and decreased foraging time.

Emergent marshes around the Salton Sea support one of the largest remaining populations of Yuma Ridgway's rails in the U.S. (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010, Eddleman and Conway 2018). Much of the rail habitat at the Salton Sea is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (at Sonny Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge) and California Department of Fish and Wildlife (at Wister Wildlife Management Area). Recently, unmanaged marshes have appeared at agricultural drainage outlets around the Salton Sea and are becoming more common as sea levels recede (Barnum et al. 2017). Marsh bird survey results suggest Yuma Ridgway's rails are moving away from managed wetlands into the new unmanaged marshes around agricultural drainages (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, unpublished data). These new unmanaged marshes receive agricultural drainage water with varying concentrations of selenium, whereas managed marshes receive Colorado River water with relatively low concentrations of selenium. Selenium affects reproductive success (e.g., embryo development) of birds at elevated concentrations. Crucially, selenium concentrations exceed EPA water quality standards in agricultural drains feeding unmanaged marshes inhabited by Yuma Ridgway's rails (Saiki et al. 2012). As such, rails within the unmanaged marshes may be at risk from elevated selenium concentrations and these unmanaged marshes may create an ecological trap for the rails.

Understanding why migration occurs is of central importance to the evolution of migratory behavior, and the mechanisms governing migratory decisions continues to be an active area of research. One widespread and well-studied migration pattern that has produced insights into why birds migrate is differential migration. Differential migration can be broadly defined as intraspecific variation in migratory behavior, and research has often focused on age, sex, or population-specific variation in migration timing, speed, or distance, choice of wintering area, or whether to migrate or not (i.e., partial migration; reviewed in Cristol et al. 1999, Chapman et al. 2011). While differential migration is widespread and well-studied, the underlying causes of this phenomena remain difficult to elucidate.<br> <br>Research attempting to understand the underlying causes of differential migration have primarily focused on three mechanistic hypotheses. First, the arrival time hypothesis posits that intrasexual competition for access to breeding territories results in differential migration whereby the sex establishing and maintaining the breeding territory arrives to the breeding range earlier because it migrated a shorter distance or did not migrate at all (Ketterson & Nolan 1976, Myers 1981). Second, the body size hypothesis posits that larger individuals can better survive harsh winter conditions that are closer to, or on, the breeding grounds (Mayr 1963, Ketterson & Nolan 1976). Third, the social dominance hypothesis posits that intraspecific competition for limited winter resources results in subordinate individuals migrating farther because dominant individuals restrict their access to resources (Ketterson & Nolan 1976, Gauthreaux 1978).<br> <br>Despite extensive research attempting to distinguish among these hypotheses (reviewed in Cristol et al. 1999, Chapman et al. 2011), the mechanisms underlying differential migration are still equivocal. Two primary factors are responsible for this ambiguity: 1) the three traditional hypotheses often make overlapping predictions, and 2) relatively few studies explicitly test competing hypotheses, or the mechanisms underlying them, using the hypothetico-deductive approach (but see Boyle 2008, Lundblad & Conway 2020). For example, the body size, social dominance, and arrival time hypotheses all predict that the larger, more dominant, and territory establishing sex, respectively, migrate shorter distances. For some species however, these predictions often correspond to the same age and sex class (usually adult males).<br> <br>The objectives of this project are to test hypotheses to explain variation in migration distance among individual, remotely-tracked Rough-legged Hawks (<i>Buteo lagopus</i>). This hypothesis and prediction framework will also be broadened and used in a differential migration review and comparative analysis. || The underlying causes of differential migration are not known and remain a topic of debate. Research attempting to understand the underlying causes of differential migration have primarily focused on three mechanistic hypotheses: the arrival time hypothesis, the body size hypothesis, and the social dominance hypothesis. Despite extensive research attempting to distinguish among these hypotheses, the mechanisms underlying differential migration are still equivocal. We are testing these 3 hypotheses plus 3 less-common hypotheses to explain variation in migration distance among individual Rough-legged Hawks (<i>Buteo lagopus</i>). We are partnering with biologists from agencies and universities throughout North America to deploy satellite transmitters and document migration of rough-legged hawks throughout their annual migratory cycle on the North American continent. The results will help managers and scientists better understand the effects of climate change on bird migration and document important migratory flyways throughout North America. | | |[ Endangered Yellowcheek Darter (Etheostoma moorei) Yellowcheek Darter (<i>Etheostoma moorei</i>) is a fish endemic to the Little Red River watershed in Arkansas (Fig. 1). As a result of threats, geographic isolation and declining abundance, the species was listed as endangered in 2011. Populations have declined, in part, due to intense seasonal stream drying and inundation of lower stream reaches (Fig. 1). It is hypothesized that in headwater streams where periodic drying is common, habitat selection influences Yellowcheek Darter distribution and abundance. Seasonal drought is typical in this region, and as drying occurs, individuals must move from riffles into neighboring pools, move into the hyporheic zone, migrate large distances to a persistent riffle, or perish. It is well-established that other darter species take refuge in pools during riffle drying. However, Yellowcheek Darter has only been collected in riffles, and hence has been identified as an obligate riffle-dweller.

Derived from fertilizers and manure, the atmospheric nitrogen drives algal blooms in SEKI's lakes (Barron and Nydick 2018), and contributes significantly to smog (Almaraz et al., 2018), despite the park being designated a \"Class I\" area, intended by the Clean Air Act to receive the highest level of air quality protection. || <b>Sequoia and Kings Canyon (SEKI) National Park has an immediate management need to verify predictions of copper deposition to SEKI lakes, determine if copper and nitrogen synergize to drive algal blooms in the lakes, and establish if copper is bioaccumulating in the food web and impacting fish and amphibian health.</b> | | |[ Assessing habitat suitability and the spatial design of recovery options for southern mountain caribou in western North America. ](/coopunits/project/210851059712/david.ausband) | September 2025 || Southern mountain caribou have declined precipitously in western North America in recent decades and both the US and Canadian government s are working collaboratively on recovery efforts for this species.

Over recent decades, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and state fish and wildlife management agency biologists have responded to an increased frequency of mussel die-offs, enigmatic declines, and problems with decreased mussel growth and survival, but a definiticve cause has yet to be identified. However, a recent, but unexplained relation has been identified between manganese (Mn) concentrations and several of these mussel decline and die-off events. Therefore, we propose to examine the toxicity of Mn to mussels in controlled laboratory tests with captively propagated larval and juvenile mussels and with adult mussels collected from low Mn-containing streams. We will then compare these findings to mussels and Mn concentrations in water and sediment from streams where die-offs and declines have occurred. This high impact project focuses on native freshwater mussel conservation priorities of the Southeast region and potentially nation-wide. The project has direct links to the strategic science needs of the natural and cultural resource managers in the region and beyond, because it addresses specific priorities outlined in the State Wildlife Action Plans for the conservation of native freshwater mussels in the States of North Carolina and Virginia and federal at-risk molluscan species in Region 4 and Region 5 of the USFWS and others across the country. In addition, this project will have direct relevance and benefit to other federal resource management and research agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, who utilize the mussel toxicity data in water quality criterion development. The completion of these research objectives will provide natural resource managers and other decision makers with real-world exposure and survival scenarios and would directly impact the recovery plan for the endangered Appalachian Elktoe mussel by informing the potential causal mechanisms for its die-off and decline in the Little Tennessee River of North Carolina. The persistence of all freshwater mussels will be addressed in the scope of the project. || The Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States contain the greatest biodiversity of native freshwater mussels in the world, but they are highly imperiled due to habitat alteration and destruction, pollution and poor water quality, and the introduction of aquatic invasive species.

Now they are at even greater risk from the stresses associated with climate change induced sea level rise and its associated changes in salinity, temperature, and stream flow. In this project, a unique opportunity exists to investigate the potential adaptation and vulnerability of a native freshwater mussel, the Tidewater Mucket, in these coastal river systems and offer solutions for its conservation. We have recently discovered a population of these mussels in a reservoir along the North Carolina-Virginia border that have been isolated from their native riverine habitat and associated natural fluctuations in salinity for over 50 years. These mussels have apparently adapted to the relatively high temperatures, low flow, and low salinity of a reservoir environment, whereas their native counterpart populations of Tidewater Mucket in the downstream portions of coastal rivers that have adapted to withstand small but periodic exposures to salinity and altered flows are declining. Our federal and state natural resource management partners, policy makers, and other stakeholders would like to know how these native coastal plain mussel populations will respond to larger and longer durations of salinity incursions like those predicted with sea level rise. In this study, we will use mussels from both the reservoir and riverine populations to understand their vulnerability to salinity by conducting sensitivity tests under controlled laboratory conditions, determine the potential effects of natural riverine salinity gradients by conducting a transplant experiment, and develop risk-based visualization maps of mussel salinity tolerances in existing occupied habitats incorporating predictions in sea level rise and projected salinity ranges. The outcomes of this research will provide actionable management and conservation information for maintaining these highly imperiled, but valuable molluscan resources. || The freshwater aquatic organisms that inhabit rivers, especially those that reside in coastal drainages live in constrained corridors. Thus, populations can only move and adapt to changing environmental conditions in a longitudinal manner (upstream to downstream or downstream to upstream). Many of these organisms have evolved and adapted to live in preferred habitats and water quality conditions within these streams, and relatively rapid human-induced changes pose a unique challenge for their continued survival and persistence. This is especially true for our native freshwater mussels belonging to the family Unionidae, which are already among the most imperiled groups of fauna on the planet. One such factor associated with changing environmental conditions in a climate-influenced scenario that may adversely impact freshwater mussels inhabiting coastal rivers is sea level rise and accompanying changes in the salinity regime. For example, a recent published study has shown that 42% of coastal North Carolina could be inundated with 100 cm of sea level rise and that evaluating this risk is essential for understanding adaptation potential and decision making. Therefore, the overall aim of this project is to investigate the adaptation and vulnerability potential of a native freshwater mussel living in coastal riverine drainages to climate-induced, sea level rise, specifically fluctuating salinity, temperature, and flow regimes. The specific objectives of our study are to: (1) assess the vulnerability of the Tidewater Mucket (<i>Leptodea ochracea</i>), an imperiled freshwater mussel species that resides in lower Atlantic Slope coastal drainages to salinity by conducting standard sensitivity tests with early life stages (e.g., larvae, juveniles) of the mussel under controlled laboratory conditions; (2) determine the potential effects of natural riverine salinity gradients on adult mussels by conducting a reciprocal transplant experiment with salinity adapted and non-salinity adapted mussels; and (3) develop a risk-based scenario of mussel salinity tolerances in existing occupied habitats incorporating predictions in sea level rise and projected salinity ranges. This project directly addresses Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center and partner agency priority topics and is a collaborative effort among North Carolina State University, the U.S. Geological Survey's North Carolina Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Raleigh North Carolina Field Office, the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, and the University of Georgia. The peer-reviewed publications, relevant infographics for web sites, and visualization maps of the overlap of sea level rise and mussel salinity sensitivity that will comprise our primary products and deliverables will illustrate the areas of rivers where mussels may be lost or conserved due to climate-induced salinity changes and will provide federal and state natural resource managers, policy makers, and future researchers with actionable management and conservation information and potential options for maintaining this highly imperiled, but valuable molluscan resource in the face of predicted climate-induced sea level rise and salinity fluctuations. | | |[ Patterns of greenness (NDVI) in the Southern Great Plains and their influence on reproduction of a declining prairie grouse. ](/coopunits/project/210686777344/amessier) | August 2022 || We are evaluating the utility of NDVI and phenology-based metrics in estimating lesser prairie-chicken reproductive habitat quality remotely over broad spatial scales. || <b>Problem statement:</b><br>Temporal patterns in greenness values that describe site-specific plant phenology could also be useful for evaluating habitat quality in grasslands.

A growth analysis using summer and fall electrofishing data found that steelhead have not been greatly impacted by wood treatment while Coho Salmon growth per day (mmd-1) after treatment was significantly higher in Pudding Creek than Caspar Creek. Billions of dollars have been spent on watershed restoration in California in recent decades, yet relatively few studies have linked habitat improvements with any effects on fish survival, growth, or abundance. This study will quantitatively measure the effect of large woody debris supplementation on the survival, growth, and abundance of Coho salmon and Steelhead trout so that managers can make informed decisions on how to most efficiently spend the limited amount of restoration funds available. || The object of this project is to evaluate the growth and survival response of endangered Central California Coast Coho Salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus kisutch</i>) and threatened Northern California steelhead (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) to large woody debris (LWD) treatments on Pudding Creek in Fort Bragg, California using a before-after-control-impact design. This analysis comes from data collected in a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) study initiated in 2012 based on monitoring salmon populations on both Caspar and Pudding creeks. In 2015, LWD was strategically placed in 80% of mainstem Pudding Creek while Caspar Creek was the untreated control.

Invasive species management is particularly challenging in aquatic habitats, where higher invasion velocities and stronger interactions with native biota result in more significant disruptions to ecosystem structure and function. In particular, through competition, predation, and disruption to nutrient and energy flows, invasive species often lead to a reduction and/or loss of native populations and can decrease ecosystem resiliency to disturbance. In collaboration with state fisheries management agencies and Penn State University, we will apply a novel quantitative framework for riverscape genetics to better understand and predict the invasion potential of invasive flathead catfish in the Susquehanna River Basin. This research will identify management scenarios that can be used to limit future invasion and we will develop a web viewer to communicate the efficacy of different management scenarios to stakeholders and managers. || Invasive species have significant, negative effects on ecosystem structure and function, and predicting and limiting the spread of invasive organisms a priority for environmental managers.

For instance, we may be able to further explore quantifiable shifts in fish population metrics in response to ecological perturbations or management interventions. Thus, the project's focus will be on data analytics and multi-agency collaboration. This project is intended to involve a partnership with one or more federal or state agencies in the southeastern U.S. Analyses focused on variability may help inform survey designs (e.g., reduce monitoring effort by eliminating sites or skipping years?), have implications for interpreting data produced by monitoring programs (e.g., trend detection), and be an important consideration for scenario forecasting (e.g., predicting potential frequency of extreme events). || We intend to collaborate with one or more partners conducting monitoring, research, or management of fishes in the southeastern U.S. This partnership will likely include working with the collaborator to identify and prioritize an information need along with an assessment of access to sufficient monitoring data. Model development will be initially guided by discussions with potential project partners in order to identify availability of fish population data (e.g., # of sampling sites and sampling years) as well as availability of covariate information or site-level characteristics (e.g., water clarity, temperature, sampling depth, spatial location). Of course, some details of model development and data analysis will be dependent on available data. However, we expect that a mixed-model framework will be conducive for asking questions about changes in spatial or temporal variation. This project will support the professional development of one or more graduate students, including the opportunity to report findings. The project will help build capacity in quantitative assessment and further support development of statistically sound long-term natural resource monitoring. | | |[ Updating population parameters of Sicklefin Redhorse with new data form the Hiawassee River Basin ](/coopunits/project/210384820224/irwin) | August 2021 || The Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GADNR) is engaged in collaborative efforts to monitor Sicklefin Redhorse (<i>Moxostoma</i>, undescribed) in north Georgia. We are adding new data from GADNR and attempting to estimate additional parameters. || Sicklefin Redhorse (<i>Moxostoma</i> sp.) is a native freshwater fish (undescribed species), whose range includes the Hiwassee River Basin in NC and GA, and the Little Tennessee River Basin in NC. The fish is rare within its range and is facing potential threats such as habitat degradation and migratory barriers. Little is currently known about the status and population dynamics of Sicklefin Redhorse, which could impede effective management. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources is engaged in collaborative efforts to monitor Sicklefin Redhorse in north Georgia. In addition, the Sicklefin Redhorse Conservation Committee (which is a partnership that consists of state agencies, federal agencies, NGOs, and power companies) is devoted to conservation and management of the species. The Georgia Cooperative Research Unit recently collaborated with the Sicklefin Redhorse Conservation Committee and researchers from University of Georgia to develop a population model estimating important parameters to evaluate the status of the Sicklefin Redhorse population in Brasstown Creek, GA using capture-mark-recapture data. More recent data will be included in an updated model to refine estimates of important population parameters, which may influence future monitoring or management decisions. | | |[ Impact of extreme events on native and nonnative fauna on Hawaii stream ecosystem ](/coopunits/project/210378811392/kjsilas) | November 2020 || Freshwater is a critical driver for island ecosystems. Climate change has fundamentally altered the water cycle in these tropical islands. The changes in dynamic patterns of streamflow could result in the temporal and spatial difference in the fluvial, estuarine, and coastal habitats. In particular, these habitats support the nine native aquatic species in Hawaii at different stages of their amphidromous life cycle. To examine how changes in streamflow regime has impacted habitat quality for native migratory aquatic species, an ongoing project has examined statewide long-term stream records. We are in the process of building hydrological models and connecting the stream dynamics with existing biological data to address the climate impact on stream habitats. In this study we will examine the historical daily flow and rainfall records to describe the hydrological patterns of stream habitats in Hawaii and we will empirically evaluate the swimming performance of various non-native species in order to better predict the effect of extreme high flow events on non-native fish populations in various stream reaches. With similar concept, we will connect with like-minded researchers in Puerto Rico to explore and develop a comparative study to address the changing aquatic ecosystems due to the extreme flood. This research project has arisen explicitly from existing research and discussions with local stakeholders (e.g., Commission on Water Resource Management, Hawaii Fish Habitat Partnership, National Fish Habitat Partnership, Pacific Island Fisheries and Wildlife Services) and researchers from different regions. Intermediate results will be presented to stakeholders to determine the most useful format for final dissemination to user groups. || Freshwater is a critical driver for island ecosystems.

Anthropogenic climate change and alteration of reef fish assemblages have the potential to increase the abundance and range of <i>Gambierdiscus</i> spp. However, it is not clear how the resulting changes to reef ecosystems may interact to influence the prevalence of ciguatoxic fishes and thus the risk of CFP posed to local communities dependent upon these fisheries. Therefore, the overall goal of the proposed study is to begin to disentangle the complex relationship between the effects of anthropogenic climate change, fishing pressure on herbivorous reef fishes, and the prevalence of ciguatoxic fishes. Therefore, the primary objective of this proposed study is to assess the prevalence of ciguatoxins in reef fishes along a disturbance gradient created by a major coral bleaching event that spans sites inside and outside areas protected from fishing pressure along the west coast of Hawai'i Island. Secondarily, the degree of temporal stability or seasonality in the prevalence of ciguatoxins in reef fishes over the course of the proposed study will be assessed to the extent possible under the proposed sampling regime. || Cigtera fish poisoning (CFP) is caused by consumption of reef fishes containing toxins produced by epiphytic dinoflagellates in the genus <i>Gambierdiscus</i>.

These fish have also been impacted by a suite of threats and the Gulf of Maine DPS Atlantic salmon were added to the federal Species of Concern list in 1997 and the Endangered Species list in 2000. In 2009, Atlantic salmon returning to the Penobscot, Kennebec, and Androscoggin Rivers were included in the Gulf of Maine DPS as a federally endangered species. <br> <br>Atlantic salmon are native to the northern Atlantic Ocean and its drainages. The anadromous form hatches from eggs deposited in cold headwater streams where it develops into a small, territorial drift-feeding fish (parr). As territorial juveniles in freshwater, Atlantic salmon parr may compete for resources with native and introduced species, limiting their access to resources (Callaway and Aschehoug 2000) and decreasing survival (Nakano et al. 1998; Gunckel et al. 2002). Smallmouth bass are notable as they were introduced into New England waters more than a century ago and have expanded into nearly every historical Atlantic salmon watershed (Warner 2005; Valois et al. 2009). Where they overlap, introduced smallmouth bass may compete with Atlantic salmon for physical habitat and food (Fausch 1998; Coghlan and Ringler 2005). Atlantic salmon populations may also suffer from direct predation by smallmouth bass in fresh water.<br> <br>The stream-dwelling parr undergoes a complex suite of behavioral, morphological and physiological changes resulting in a migratory smolt (McCormick and Saunders 1987). The parr-smolt transition is a critical transitional stage in the life history of this species. Successful transition into the marine environment is thought to occur during a \"window of opportunity,\" when physiological condition is optimal for survival (McCormick and Saunders 1987). Poor synchrony can result in high mortality in the estuary (McCormick et al. 1999; Stich et al., 2015) or at sea (Virtanen et al., 1991; Staurnes et al., 1993; Stich et al., 2014). As smolts leave rearing habitats and migrate seaward, they encounter geomorphic barriers, changing flow, varying turbidity, and a gauntlet of predators. Atlantic salmon currently travel through waters with a diverse array of nonnative resident fishes, including brown trout, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and northern pike. Migration is a time of high risk of predation (Blackwell et al. 1997; Kocik et al. 2009; Hawkes et al. 2013). High mortality of smolts is often observed in the estuaries (Kocik et al., 2009; Holbrook et al., 2011) waters (Lacroix, et al., 2011; Thorstad et al., 2012a; 2012b). The proposed work is aimed at better characterizing the role predation may have during their early life history. || In 2009, Atlantic salmon returning to the Penobscot, Kennebec, and Androscoggin Rivers were included in the Gulf of Maine DPS as a federally endangered species.

Species that rely on large areas of undisturbed habitat are often the first to disappear. Loss of connectivity among populations may reduce genetic variation and the ability to respond to changing environmental conditions. Theory and empirical precedent have shown that island populations face greater risks of extinction, especially when small<sup>1</sup>. The loss of connectivity may accordingly accelerate the irreversible loss of entire species.<br>Two hundred years ago an estimated 50,000 grizzly bears (<i>Ursus arctos</i>) inhabited North America (fws.gov). The arrival of Europeans brought heavy persecution, habitat destruction, and the rapid downfall of a species that had dominated the landscape for thousands of years. By 1975, within the contiguous US only six small populations clung to existence in just 2% of grizzly bears' former range<sup>2</sup>.<br>In 1973, the Endangered Species Act was enacted and grizzly bears were among the first species protected. Six recovery ecosystems were designated (Fig. 1) and unprecedented collaborations began among agencies, tribes, landowners, and the public in efforts to recover the last grizzly bear populations. Through these efforts, numbers have slowly increased. Today population estimates exceed 700 animals in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) and 1000 in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE). The Selkirk Ecosystem (SE) has approximately 80 grizzly bears, and augmentations into the Cabinet-Yaak Ecosystem (CYE) helped boost the population to an estimated 50 animals. To date, the Bitterroot (BE) and North Cascades Ecosystems (NCE) lack any known permanent residents.<br>The once-contiguous grizzly bear populations remain largely isolated. Even though some ecosystems are contiguous into Canada, grizzly bears in these areas face similar threats of low numbers, population fragmentation, and habitat loss<sup>2</sup>. With increasing numbers in the NCDE and GYE, grizzly bears have slowly regained parts of their former range. By 2017, only 110 km separated the two distributions, and individuals had been detected between the ecosystems nearly two dozen times<sup>3</sup>. While the GYE still likely remains isolated, researchersrecently identified potential corridors for male-mediated gene flow between the NCDE and GYE<sup>3</sup>. Their timely work was much needed and well received. No studies have addressed connectivity among the other recovery ecosystems or for females. Although several other ecosystems are in closer proximity to one-another and the NCDE, known dispersals remain rare and the likelihood and viability of connectivity remain unknown. Connectivity remains the best chance for recovering and conserving healthy populations in the CYE and SE. Natural recolonization is likely to be the only opportunity to recover grizzly bears in the BE.<br>Given the importance of connectivity, one of the most urgent conservation challenges for grizzly bears today is the identification of connectivity areas among recovery ecosystems, and proactive efforts to reduce the potential for human-grizzly bear conflicts. Connectivity is most likely to first occur through male movements because males disperse farther than females, who often stay in the vicinity of their mothers' home ranges<sup>4-6</sup>. Ecosystems will therefore likely become genetically connected first, but will remain demographically isolated unless females also become connected through range expansion. Demographic connectivity would particularly improve long-term conservation of the CYE and SE populations given their low numbers, and is imperative for recovering grizzly bears in the BE. Research is thus needed to assess the potential corridors that could promote genetic and demographic connectivity for males and females among recovery ecosystems. This would require innovative research to adapt a recently-used approach<sup>3</sup> to focus more on habitat use, home range acquisition, and range expansion rather than movement paths alone due to females' short-distance dispersals. Models are likewise needed to identify specific movement corridors, denning sites, and areas that are most likely to impede movements, such as where corridors are intersected by roads. | | |[ State Parks Foundation ](/coopunits/project/210106988544/Mike.Mitchell) | November 2020 || Work collaboratively with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks to develop a template, process and staff training from which a series of foundation documents for each of the 55 units of the state park system will be written.

It is expected that the student will lead at least two peer reviewed journal articles resulting from this research collaboration. || Prior to European settlement, pumas occupied all of the contiguous US (CONUS). Two centuries of persecution, depletion of ungulate prey, and habitat loss reduced their range to the western states and southern Florida (Logan and Sweanor 2010). Pumas are a hunted species in all states except California and Florida. As an area-sensitive species that requires dispersal among neighboring populations (Beier 1993, Grigione 2002), they would benefit from coordinated management at large spatial scales, sometimes spanning state boundaries. Despite public support for restoring large carnivores and the puma's status as a flagship species for conservation, coordination across large areas rarely occurs. Such efforts would be abetted by a comprehensive assessment of puma densities across their range in the contiguous US (CONUS). This project will use existing cougar data sets to predict cougar density and distribution across North America. The findings of this project will inform hunting programs, provide insight into cougar ecology, anticipate and manage eastward re-colonization, identify small or potentially isolated populations, and help shape future land use and connectivity plans. | | |[ Preventing Predation: Mechanistic Drivers of and Deterrents in Conflict with Jaguars ](/coopunits/project/210103351296/Mike.Mitchell) | May 2021 || A Post Doctoral Research Associate will act as project coordinator analyzing existing data and providing direction on new data collection needs. It is expected that the postdoc will lead at least two peer reviewed journal articles resulting from this research collaboration. || Large carnivores are both feared and revered in many cultures. In North America large carnivores where once extirpated from the vast majority of their range mostly due to a perceived threat to humans and their livestock. Primary research into the ecology of wolves, cougars, and grizzly bears and a renewed conservation ethic valuing the ecological role of large carnivores has helped lead effective measures that today are seeing these large carnivores expand back into historical range. Outside of North America most jurisdictions strive for some level of carnivore conservation yet conflict and retaliatory killing remains a great conservation concern. Like many carnivores, one of the greatest human impacts on jaguars stems from conflict surrounding human agricultural developments. Retaliatory killing of jaguars in response to real or perceived depredation threat is thought to reduce the presence of jaguars on the landscape. The main objective of this research is to determine the mechanistic drivers of predator-prey distribution and interactions of jaguars in unprotected agricultural areas. | | |[ Mandatory Reporting and Harvest Surveys Evaluation ](/coopunits/project/210098544640/Mike.Mitchell) | June 2021 || A research associate to conduct analyses exploring the relative accuracy and costs of the mandatory reporting and harvest survey systems considered in previously completed, collaborative research. || The specific objective of this project is to evaluate the relative accuracy and financial costs of mandatory, self-reporting of harvest by hunters versus survey sampling to estimate the harvest of big game animals in Montana. | | |[ Predator use of white-tailed deer, mule deer, moose, and elk and influence on population dynamics. ](/coopunits/project/210098059264/Mike.Mitchell) | June 2021 || The Ph.D. project will evaluate population dynamics and predator use of white-tailed deer, mule deer, moose, and elk in northern Idaho.

Rapid mortality of Lake Trout embryos occurs when dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations are below 3.4 mg/L. Whole and ground Lake Trout carcasses caused 100% mortality of Lake Trout embryos at the substrate surface and at a depth of 20 cm in the substrate at treated spawning sites. Biological oxygen demand of the decomposing carcasses caused DO to decline to 0mg/L soon after treatments and caused the high embryo mortality. Although these previous studies suggested that Lake Trout carcasses may be a useful embryo suppression tool, the Lake Trout spawning period peaks during the last week of September, allowing only 2-3 weeks to treat spawning sites prior to the end of gillnetting (which limits carcass availability) and onset of dangerous winter conditions on Yellowstone Lake.

Identification of key spawning habitat also allows managers to better protect these key habitats and may provide a way to identify and prioritize land acquisition and easement projects in these areas. || Rock Creek is a world class trout fishery located in western Montana which also supports a robust native fish community including fluvial westslope cutthroat trout. Westslope cutthroat trout comprise a major component (appx. 40%) of the salmonid sport-fishery in the upper portion of the Rock Creek drainage. While westslope cutthroat trout are found in lower densities lower in the drainage, these populations still provide quality angling opportunities with angler catch rates of westslope cutthroat trout being quite high in comparison to their abundance (Liermann 2017, in prep). Understanding native fishes' life histories is a key component of properly managing these species. Spawning migrations are obviously an important component of a fish's life history as the successful completion of spawning is imperative to sustaining populations. Due to the long distances commonly traveled by westslope cutthroat trout to spawn in their natal tributaries, they commonly encounter difficulties in completing these migrations and may not even survive. Monitoring these migrations often identify causes for mortality/impairment that may be mitigated via restoration such as screening a diversion or removing a culvert barrier. Identification of key spawning habitat also allows managers to better protect these key habitats and may provide a way to identify and prioritize land acquisition and easement projects in these areas. The first year of this study was completed in 2018 and included some interesting findings. Genetic testing of tagged fish showed that most were non-hybridized westslope cutthroat trout based on SNPs analysis. Only three fish were found to have greater than 10% introgression with rainbow trout. Thus, it appears that this population is not just providing quality recreational angling but is also a population of conservation importance. Based on these results we have altered our study plan to further understand this population and threats to it. We are also proposing to fund a graduate research assistant to focus on the project. | | |[ Human dimensions of grizzly bear management in MT - Grizzly Bear Social Survey ](/coopunits/project/210093203456/Mike.Mitchell) | June 2020 || A graduate student will work closely with FWP Staff to develop, implement, and report on a survey of Montanans' attitudes about grizzly bears and grizzly bear management. || Design a survey to provide information about public tolerance for grizzly bears, attitudes about grizzly bear management, and the social and personal drivers of public attitudes in specific areas of Montana.<br>Design a sampling scheme that will result in estimates of the quantities of interest at the appropriate spatial scales, for the populations of interest.<br>Implement the survey in a timely and cost-efficient manner, including incorporation of methodology to account for non-response bias.<br>Analyze data using rigorous techniques and sample response weighting to ensure accurate inferences to the extent possible.<br>Present results for distribution in a concise written report and for publication in the peer-reviewed literature, as well as in verbal presentations.<br>Provide recommendations regarding approaches to grizzly bear management in line with survey results and in the context of grizzly bear management outlined in existing FWP documentation of the grizzly bear planning Structured Decision Making process and other ongoing grizzly bear planning efforts. | | |[ Blackfoot Clearwater Elk Study ](/coopunits/project/210092503040/Mike.Mitchell) | June 2022 || A graduate student will conduct a research project evaluating the effects of wildfire on elk forage, demography, and distributions in the Blackfoot-Clearwater area, and will lead data analysis, writing, and completion of the final report. || The specific objectives of this project are to:<br>1.

Several non-game species are classified as SOC 3 (higher priority) and/or as Species of Greatest Inventory Need (SGIN) in the SWAP, due to a lack of information on population status or distribution. Changing the SOC status for species for which we lack information and assessing the impacts of habitat management on non-game avian species both rely upon survey and monitoring programs to provide information about status and trend (Yoccoz et al. 2001, Gitzen & Millspaugh 2012). Existing monitoring tools such as the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS; Sauer et al. 2016), and Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions (IMBCR; Pavlacky et al. 2017) provide measures of trend (BBS), density and occupancy (IMBCR) for many bird species to inform these objectives. However, these programs don't provide sufficient information on species that are uncommon (e.g. Great Gray Owl, <i>Strix nebulosa</i>), elusive (e.g. Greater Short-Horned Lizard, <i>Phrynosoma hernandesi</i>), or restricted to specific habitats (e.g. Black Rosy Finches, <i>Leucosticte atrata</i>) or habitat features (e.g. Black Swifts; <i>Cypseloides niger</i>). As such, MFWP has initiated extensive survey efforts for several SGIN not sufficiently detected by existing monitoring programs. These efforts have already identified potential habitat and provided further information regarding range extent, while also highlighting the limitations of some survey designs to acquire the needed information for some species. A framework that characterizes the <u>survey effort needed to attain certain information</u> based on species characteristics would <u>support efficient survey effort </u>to support status assessment for SGIN species (Legg & Nagy 2006).<br><b> </b><br>In addition to acquiring adequate information to inform conservation status for remaining SGIN species, MFWP is tasked with assessing the effectiveness of habitat management. FWP expends considerable resources on habitat management on FWP-owned and private lands, which in many cases is focused in part on improving habitat for non-game species and thereby maintaining or improving their distribution. Within existing habitat management initiatives, the Forest Management Plan (MFWP 2017) requires decadal (or sooner) review while the Grassland Initiative (MFWP 2017) calls for quantitative effectiveness monitoring in order to meet conservation objectives. Historically, addressing specific conservation objectives has utilized independent monitoring designs for local management units, but the diversity of designs precludes utility and effective integration into management programs at larger scales (Bart 2005). Existing programs, which identify the effects of habitat change at larger spatial and temporal scales (e.g. Hitch & Leberg 2007, Pavlacky et al. 2017, Specht & Arnold in review), may provide sufficient power to detect changes in populations resulting from local habitat management treatments over short time periods if supplemented with additional targeted sampling (Pavlacky et al. 2017). This approach would capitalize on existing rigorous sampling designs, analytical approaches and expertise while contributing to larger datasets (Gitzen & Millspaugh 2012). Power analyses can be used to understand the relative efficiency of independent monitoring designs compared to that of large-scale, coordinated monitoring programs and adaptations at detecting the effects of habitat conservation and management actions on bird communities, as well as informing discussion about the level of effort that might be required for rigorous evaluations of the effects of habitat management. | | |[ Fisher Occupancy, Habitat Needs, and Responses to Management in the Northern Rocky Mountains ](/coopunits/project/210074802176/Mike.Mitchell) | June 2022 || A MS student will estimate the probability that potentially suitable habitat is occupied across the 3-state range of NRM fishers (occupancy estimate); estimate the influence of forest type, known fisher population centers, translocation history, and harvest/incidental mortality on fisher occupancy; and integrate survey design with the multi-state wolverine occupancy survey design, and coordinate field logistics with similar survey efforts by USFS staff in specific forest units. || The NRM fisher population is considered a distinct population segment by the USFWS because it is disjunct from other fisher populations. NRM fisher have been petitioned for listing as a federally threatened species on multiple occasions. In 2011, the USFWS determined fishers were not warranted for listing. In response to another petition in 2013, the USFWS initiate a status review in January 2017 to consider fishers for protections under the Endangered Species Act, and they decided in October 2017 that fishers are not warranted for listing.

Operations at Libby Dam since construction have generally been a gradual conversion to conditions that more closely simulate normative river conditions. Montana FWP conducted annual mark recapture surveys of resident trout (rainbow, cutthroat, brown and bull trout) in the Kootenai River in four sections including the Libby Dam (river mile [RM] 218.2-221.7; 18,480 feet), the Re-Regulation (Re-reg) the Flower-Pipe Section 201.1-204.0; 15,450 feet), and Troy section (RM 183.8-186.2; 12,619 feet). Collectively the length of these four river sections comprise about 21% of the Montana portion of the Kootenai River downstream of Libby Dam. The Libby Dam, Flower-Pipe and Troy sections were sampled annually during September 2011-2017 and the Re-Regulation section was sampled annually in March 2011-2018. MFWP also attempted to partition apparent survival into approximately 6-month periods by sampling the Re-Reg section in the fall of 2015, 2016, and 2017, and the Flower-Pipe and Troy sections during the spring of 2016 and 2017 (Table 1). The objective of this work is to estimate apparent survival of resident trout in four sections of the Kootenai River and attempt to correlate several biological and environmental covariates to these vital statistics with the expectation of developing management recommendations to improve the survival of Kootenai River trout. MFWP is seeking technical assistance from the University of Montana to complete these analyses. We have discussed this project with Dr. Paul Lukacs and worked collaboratively to develop this statement of work. | | |[ Modeling large mammal predator-prey dynamics to inform harvest management ](/coopunits/project/210073364480/Mike.Mitchell) | June 2021 || A PhD student is to us IDFG's existing data to fomulate and parameterize predator-prey models, with the aim to help manage Idaho's multiple predators (wolves, cougars, bears, coyotes, and bobcats) and multiple prey species (mule deer, elk, white-tailed deer, and moose) in a community context. || Predation is a fundamental ecological process. It is critically important in shaping biological communities, and affecting coupled human-natural systems. However, the effects of predation on prey populations are continually debated (e.g., Schmitz, Hamback & Beckerman 2000; Shurin compensatory (Errington 1946; Vucetich, Smith & Stahler 2005), where prey population dynamics are not significantly affected (e.g., predators remove the least fit individuals that were not going to survive the winter); or predation can be additive (Gasaway et al. 1983; Messier 1994), where prey population dynamics are significantly impacted by predators. When predation is additive, it can be limiting or regulating (dependent on prey densities). These species interactions can be key in shaping communities.<br>Most predator-prey models and theory are based on data from single predator, single prey systems such as the iconic Isle Royale Moose-wolf system (Messier 1994; Vucetich et al. 2011). However, there is a current lack of studies on how multiple predators and multiple prey species can interact to determine the overall community dynamics. In reality, multiple predators and multiple prey are part of the same community and can interact in fundamental ways. Indeed, the recent recovery of gray wolves, expansion of grizzly bears, and reported increases in mountain lion populations across some areas of the west, including Idaho, have dramatically increased the complexity and number of interactions between now 3-4 predators, and up to 6 large ungulate species. In many systems, for example, there may be wolves, and mountain lions simultaneously preying on shared elk, white-tailed deer, mule deer and bighorn sheep.<br>However, most current management strategies evaluate and manage populations independently. For example, state wildlife agencies often have independent, isolated, elk, deer, or wolf (for example) management plans that are not integrated. Historically, in the absence of such complexity, such independent management may have been warranted. Unfortunately, predator and prey population dynamics do not operate in isolation, especially in more complex ecological communities. For example, altering harvest of mule deer and elk are likely to affect predator populations that are dependent on them. Conversely, management of wolves is likely to have an effect on the wolves' prey population dynamics, and, potentially other shared predators on those same prey populations.<br>The goal of this project is to use IDFG's existing data to formulate and parameterize predator-prey models, with the aim to help manage Idaho's multiple predators (wolves, cougars, bears, coyotes, and bobcats) and multiple prey species (mule deer, elk, white-tailed deer, and moose) in a community context. These models will incorporate how the multiple predator and prey populations affect each other. We will formulate mechanistic mathematical models that include species interactions and feedbacks, mainly using existing IDFG data on these populations, but also drawing from previous research in other areas. These models will allow us to explore various management strategies to optimize management across the entire predator-prey community. For example, researchers and managers recently developed and applied such mathematical predator-prey modeling to systems of wolves, moose, caribou, mountain lions and 'deer' (including mule deer and white-tailed deer) in British Columbia to guide multispecies harvest (and recovery of endangered caribou) management for both ungulates and carnivores. | | |[ A strategic process for fisheries management and aquatic conservation.

In collaboration with MPGRanch, we will evaluate the stress response of black bears using the private conservation property. We will measurethe stress response of black bears and grizzly bears in the Lower Blackfoot Valley of Northwest Montana using scatdetectiondogs (WD4C, 2019) and on MPG Ranch opportunistically by researchers who are checking and backtrackingblack bear sightings at game cameras. In the Lower Blackfoot, we will relate this response to opposinglevels of road management and traffic during the spring black bear hunting season following den emergence. OnMPG Ranch we want to be able to elucidate the stress response of bears using the property to be able to determine ifcurrent levels and patterns of use are sustainable for the individual's persistence. We will also be obtainingindividual sex, individual ID, and species data from fecal DNA analyses for both study areas.Using cortisol concentrations that we obtain from the scat samples, we will address the followingquestions: (1) do bears exhibit a stress response to roads?; (2) if so, does the stress response vary among the levels ofaccess restrictions we are testing?; (3) what distance within our 800m buffer do bears begin to show a physiologicalstress response?; (4) is there any variation in stress response between individuals or species?; and, (5) do males orfemales show a greater stress response? The ability roads have to give humans access into wildlife habitat has beenshown to have a negative physiological effect on bears. Bears have large home ranges that often overlap with forestroads. Thus, we hypothesize that motorized use roads will cause a bear to have an increased stress response greaterthan both non-motorized use roads and our control group. If this is true, then we predict that when a bear encountersmotorized use roads, we will observe the largest spike in cortisol concentrations. Whereas, when a bear encounters anon-motorized use road, we believe the observed cortisol concentrations will be greater than our control group butless than the motorized use group. Regardless, we will obtain baseline fecal glucocorticoid levels from the WalesCreek Wilderness Study Area.This study will provide support for a number of secretarial orders including: No. 3347, No. 3356, No. 3362,No. 3366 by improving game and habitat management, improving and/or maintaining hunting, fishing, shooting,recreating, and wildlife conservation opportunities, and lastly, by improving habitat quality of big game species.

Addressing CWD and its impacts will be a long-term, nationwide effort. This proposal will serve as a primary step to building essential knowledge about the potential for CWDs to impact the North American Model of Wildlife Management as well as for addressing CWD on tribal lands. We will use culturally appropriate ethnographic approaches to conduct indepth interviews and nominal group research to better understand tribal perspectives and indigenous knowledge concerning the risks of CWD to hunting opportunities, food security, and cultural practices (Daigle, Michelle, Ranco, and Emery Hansen, Dockry, Moser, Stark, and Gilbert 2014). Such systematic information concerning the perceived threat of CWD will be extremely useful to the tribes and wildlife management agencies in planning and prioritizing future research and management activities to address CWD and its impacts. Specifically, we will:<br> <br>1) Complete a systematic review of research and activities addressing the human dimensions of CWD to develop a state-of-the-knowledge summary of the topic; 2) Complete interviews and nominal groups workshops with tribal leadership and members across Region 3 USFWS affected or potentially affected by CWD; 3) Identify participants' perceived risks of CWD to hunting, food security, and cultural practices; 4) Identify the Tribes indigenous knowledge and participants' personal beliefs about research and management activities to address the perceived risks of CWD to hunting, food security, and cultural practices; 5) Identify participants' prioritization for research and management activities to address the perceived risks of CWD to hunting, food security, and cultural practices; 6) Use the study results to help information management plans and programs at the federal, state and tribal levels design to address the threat of CWD to hunting and food security.<i> </i><br><i></i><br>The proposed project is the first step in assessing the key threats posed by CWD for hunting participation, cultural practices, and food security for Tribes in the Midwest. A better understanding of these threats and management actions to address such threats could help in the design of the federal, state, and tribal programs that are resilient to such threats. Results of the group workshops will provide useful information about CWD threats and potential management actions and will be crucial to designing long-term management programs and research efforts. || The scope of this study includes: 1) completing a systematic review to determine the state-of-knowledge concerning management activities and human dimensions research related to CWD and the use of Indigenous knowledge for wildlife management; and 2) identifying and prioritizing the key concerns and perspectives of tribes related to CWD in Region 3 USFWS.

These decomposing habitat structures modify the temperature and moisture conditions in the forest itself. Inside and around downed wood, local climate conditions, or microclimates, provide wildlife with stable habitats that allow for persistence during and after wildfires. Cooler, wetter microclimates buffer the effects of wildfire in Oregon's forests, making microclimate an important component of forest management. Despite the significance of downed wood to forest ecosystem function, forest management practices require only two downed logs to be retained for every acre harvested. To better inform forest management and species conservation efforts, it is vital that we better understand the role of downed wood in post-fire recovery of forest-dependent species. We propose a three-year study that explores the relationship between downed wood, microclimate, and wildfire on terrestrial salamander diversity. Terrestrial salamanders are sensitive to environmental change, dependent on moist habitats, and are strongly associated with downed wood. We will compare salamander diversity and abundance in forests that vary in time since fire in forests across western Oregon, capturing the inherent climate variation from the moist northern end to the drier southern end of the state. We will relate salamander presence and abundance with microclimates associated with downed wood, expecting to find more salamanders, including rare and threatened species, in forests with cooler, wetter microclimates. In areas with recent, high severity fire, we expect downed wood to facilitate salamander persistence, particularly in the drier forests of southern Oregon. This research will provide managers with important information on the quantity and quality of downed wood needed to maintain microclimate conditions that can protect and buffer forests from the ever-increasing threat of climate-driven wildfires. || By modifying the temperature and moisture conditions in the forest itself, downed wood in forest ecosystems provide wildlife with local climate conditions, or microclimates, that allow for persistence during and after wildfires.

Specifically, our objectives are to: 1)characterize density, growth, and mortality of juvenile river herring in estuaries and upstream lakes, 2) assess age, size, and timing of juvenile river herring during emigration from freshwater to estuarine habitats, and 3) evaluate relationships between spawning adults, juvenile abundance and timing of movements to identify conditions that promote growth and survival. We hypothesize that the timing of juvenile emigration from lakes, size at emigration, and growth in lakes and estuaries will vary among systems and will depend on river herring densities, habitat characteristics, and food resources. The new data collected will be incorporated into a full life-cycle model developed by our collaborators at MADMF to inform the run dynamics and migration timing that leads to the best growth and maintenance of densities, and to inform our work linking life-stages in collaboration with project partners and a population model produced as part of that work. Modeling of factors controlling juvenile size and number during egress, combined with estimates of estuarine-marine survival and growth, will help close current gaps in knowledge of the river herring life cycle and allow for improved understanding of stock-recruitment relationships and population modeling efforts. || River herring (alewife and blueback herring) undergo complex movements between oceanic, estuarine, and freshwater habitats for spawning and rearing of juveniles. Estuaries are likely critical habitats for growth particularly where upstream freshwater habitat is limited; however, no research has sampled juveniles across the freshwater to marine transition to understand the relative contributions to production in different habitats. The proposed project adds to ongoing efforts focused on assessing factors impacting freshwater productivity, monitoring of out-migrants and preliminary estuarine sampling to close the loop in our understanding of factors controlling growth and survival during emigration across the two river herring species. We will partner with other universities (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, University of Connecticut), state agencies (Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries), federal agencies (US Fish and Wildlife Service, NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center), non-profit organizations (Mystic River Watershed Association, River Herring Network, The Nature Conservancy), and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to engage citizen scientists in emigration data collection and disseminate information to scientific, public, and policy outlets.

This study will design a new suite of efficient, cost-effective, collaborative genomic resources for white-tailed deer that will be commercially available to wildlife managers and researchers at roughly half the current cost. || The majority of ecological genetic studies that have been conducted on white-tailed deer have employed 10-15 microsatellite markers to investigate population structure and relatedness or Sanger sequencing/targeted SNP assays to investigate variation at the PRNP gene. However, a number of genetic technologies have been developed over the last few years that could significantly decrease costs and increase resolution of ecological genetic analysis in deer.

These sequence data could be used to develop a smaller and more cost-effective panels for parentage/population structure analyses and PRNP genotyping. Principal Investigators have identified three new approaches that could be used to conduct genetic analysis in deer: (1) genomic analyses using thousands of SNPs to investigate fine-scale population structure and local adaptation, (2) SNP panel analysis using hundreds of SNPs to investigate coarse population structure, conduct parentage analysis, and identify PRNP variation, and (3) PRNP genotyping using amplicon sequencing. | | |[ A distributional atlas and identification guide to West Virginia fishes ](/coopunits/project/209413074944/swelsh) | December 2023 || A distributional atlas and identification guide to West Virginia's fishes will benefit federal and state agencies, anglers, and the general public in understanding the distribution, habitat, and the conservation needs and concerns of each fish species found within West Virginia.

Together with collaborators across the globe, we are using time-lapse game cameras to explore how widespread this behavior is and to then explore potential hypotheses for the behavior including: predator avoidance, ectoparasite shedding, or thermoregulation. | | |[ Global horizon scan to assess U.S. invasion risk of terrestrial and freshwater vertebrates in trade ](/coopunits/project/209190641664/cproberts) | September 2023 || Invasive species can be ecologically and economically devastating. The ability to predict the next catastrophic invasive species before it arrives and established could yield incredible dividends. Project Horizon Scan seeks to review approximately 19,000 potentially invasive species and rank their risk of establishing in the United States based on propogule pressure (how many individuals are brought into the USA each year), how well the climate matches between their native range and parts of the USA, their taxonomic relationship to other invasive species, and aspects of their life history. Horizon Scan uses these qualities to rank each of the 19,000 species to identify the 500 most likely future invaders and then convenes panels of taxonomic experts to evaluate these rankings. This information will be crucial to policy makers in deciding how to regulate the importation of particular species. || Invasive species can be ecologically and economically devastating.

Growth rates of fish are indicators of population status, and directly influence the effectiveness of regulations designed to protect spawning fish or to promote trophy fishing opportunities. Growth, combined with reproduction and survival, also determines the amount of fish biomass available for harvest, known as population production. Changing water temperatures can influence growth and production of managed fish species in multiple and complex ways, increasing the opportunity for harvest in certain locations and decreasing it in others. In this project, we will quantify how climate change influences growth and productivity of priority fish species in lakes and reservoirs throughout the Midwest. This information will enable managers to adapt management objectives to take advantage of increased growth and harvest potential in certain places, while implementing protective actions where climate change is likely to have negative effects. Such work is particularly important given that climate change impacts on fish populations are often indirect, influencing species interactions, growth rates, and recruitment in ways that are often counterintuitive and vary across the landscape of Midwestern Lakes and reservoirs. || Climate change is altering all aspects of freshwaters, with important implications for managed fisheries. Both individual growth and population production are fundamental metrics for designing and evaluating effective regulations. Partners in this research include state fisheries management agencies of Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin, in addition to USGS National Climate Adaptation Center, the University of Minnesota, University of Wisconsin, Michigan State University, and the University of Missouri. Results of this project will be used to inform managers about the effectiveness of length-based regulations under changing climates, in addition to providing managers with a tool to identify populations most likely to have experienced declines in population productivity. | | |[ Quantitative Assessment of Pelagic Fishes in Colorado Reservoirs ](/coopunits/project/206414571520/Dana.Winkelman) | June 2022 || <b>The goals of this project are to implement a statewide pelagic fish </b><b>assessment, involving paired gill-netting and nocturnal hydroacoustics surveys.

Adjacent oxbow lakes provide unique and important fisheries, but invasive bigheaded carps may divert trophic resources from native fish communities. Barriers that prevent movement of bigheaded carps into lakes may be a way to minimize the effect of fish invasions but an understanding of movements in and out of the lakes is needed to develop control strategy. We will use telemetry to monitor fish movement in and out of a major oxbow lake adjacent to the Mississippi River, identify potential migration routes, and investigate temporal aspects as they relate to temperature and discharge from the lake. || Asian carp have invaded lakes and waterways through a large section of the Mississippi River Basin.

The overall goal of this study was to identify the contemporary importance of mainstem connectivity and tributaries to maintaining life history expression, population structure, and viability of a large metapopulation of Bonneville Cutthroat Trout (BCT; <i>Oncorhynchus clarkii utah</i>) persisting in the Weber River, a highly fragmented Utah river. We used a multifaceted approach including active sampling, mark-recapture, passive PIT-tag detection, otolith microchemistry, and genetics. We collected BCT in all tributaries and the mainstem, encountering age-0 fish in three tributaries, indicating successful reproduction. In tributaries, the size structure was bimodal and consisted of smaller fish deemed to be resident and larger fish deemed to be fluvial, whereas all sizes and ages ( age-1) were present in the mainstem. We identified up to eight age classes; tributaries were dominated by ages 2 and 8, and the mainstem was dominated by ages 2, 5, 6, and 7. Tributary BCT had lower growth rates than BCT in the mainstem. We observed a surprising degree of fluvial life history expression, and fish also demonstrated very complex movement patterns across their life span. Average apparent survival (33%) was within the range estimated in similar studies for BCT, and resight rate was best explained by angler management regulations. This project was a collaboration between the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, Trout Unlimited - Utah, and Utah State University. The fact that BCT in the Weber River and tributaries still reproduce successfully in most years and are still able to grow into large, fluvial fish, suggests connectivity must be occasionally available despite considerable fragmentation. Therefore, this metapopulation may need little further human intervention if barriers to fish passage could be removed and thus connectivity could be improved and represents a high priority metapopulation for conservation, thus also highlighting the utility of our approach. || Fishes that evolutionarily demonstrated a fluvial life history expression and migrated to spawning and rearing habitat using lotic corridors are increasingly impacted by fragmentation.

In response, USACE and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife biologists initiated an adult transportation program in the 1990's with an objective of facilitating natural spawning of these populations above the dams. Unfortunately, annual rates of pre-spawn mortality (PSM) in adult Chinook salmon transported upstream of dams are high (often >40%), and could limit the ability to establish a natural population of spring Chinook if not reduced. The progeny of these outplanted adults face similar downstream passage difficulties that is further complicated by very high parasitic infection rates (>90%) of a native copepod (<i>Salmincola californiensis</i>). The infections affect the ability of outmigrating juvenile to swim, withstand stressors, and survive in saltwater during their ocean transition. This is an integrated project whose ultimate goal is the safe passage of juvenile and adult spring-run Chinook salmon to assist in the recovery of this listed stock. || Stream fragmentation and water development are among the greatest threats facing Chinook Salmon in the Pacific Northwest.<br><br>Recovery of this iconic species will require the development of effective fish passage strategies to facilitate juvenile and adult passage to and from their historic spawning grounds.<br><br>This project is a collaboration of an interdisciplinary team of researchers and managers from USGS, USACE, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Oregon State University, and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.<br><br>Water resource managers will be provided with the information needed to develop safe and efficient passage systems for juvenile and adult Chinook salmon. | | |[ Physiological Performance of Native and Invasive Northern Pike: Implications for Barrier Design in Invaded Systems ](/coopunits/project/204004294656/tlcubbage) | December 2022 || Northern Pike are an important native fish species north and west of the Alaska Mountain Range, but illegal introductions and the natural spread of pike have led to thriving invasive populations in Southcentral Alaska where they are predating on native or costly stocked salmon and trout. Although methods to remove pike in Alaska (e.g., rotenone and gillnetting) are effective under certain conditions, alternatives are needed in the greater Cook Inlet region where the risk that pike will reinvade after removal is high due to abundant and interconnected lakes and river systems. The placement of short waterfall barriers may be a potential option to prevent pike from reinvading salmon habitat. First, it is essential to determine the maximum leaping heights and swimming speeds of pike to then confidently design and test such barriers in the field. The objective of this study is to determine the maximum leaping heights, swimming speeds, and swimming endurance of pike, and how a variety of factors affect these physiological end-points in pike. We will collect pike from Fort Peck Reservoir in Montana, transport them to the Bozeman Fish Technology Center, and run leaping trials using an adjustable waterfall apparatus and swimming trials using both a swim tunnel and open channel flume. We will quantify how waterfall height, plunge pool depth, water temperature, fish size, and fish condition affect leaping abilities, and quantify how the latter three affect swimming speed and endurance maximums. Based on the literature, we expect to find that moderately sized pike will be the most successful at ascending the most difficult waterfall conditions (high waterfall heights with shallow pool depths), and water temperature will increase both leaping and swimming performance, while low fish condition will lead to reduced leaping and swimming performance. We will determine waterfall heights, pool depths, and water velocities that will both aerobically exhaust and prevent ascent of barriers by the most high-performing pike included in our trials. The results of this multi-experiment study will provide waterfall barrier parameters that theoretically will exhaust and prevent pike movement upstream. These specifications will be used to design and test barriers against invasive pike movement in the southcentral region to determine if they are a viable management option for pike in Alaska. If successful, the barrier designs can be modified and implemented in similar areas to target invasive pike while reducing impacts on native species. || Northern Pike are an important native fish species north and west of the Alaska Mountain Range, but illegal introductions and the natural spread of pike have led to thriving invasive populations in Southcentral Alaska where they are predating on native or costly stocked salmon and trout.

The overall goal of the study is to evaluate whether and how wind development influences pronghorn habitat use, the results of which will provide a useful comparison with prior work done on the influence of oil and gas development on mule deer and elk and will guide pronghorn management amid continued development. | | |[ BoR & NPS: Efficacy of conservation actions for native fishes in tributaries of the Colorado River, Grand Canyon ](/coopunits/project/203546974208/bhealy) | May 2021 || The predominantly endemic fishes of the American Southwest are highly imperiled due to pervasive hydrological alteration of aquatic habitats through river regulation and human water use, compounded by the widespread introduction of nonnative competitors and predators. The Colorado River's desert fishes evolved in an environment characterized by seasonally variable temperatures and frequent flooding and drought. However, stabilized flow and thermal regimes in the post-dam era favor nonnative fishes whose life history strategies evolved in stable and predictable environments. In the Grand Canyon, Arizona, conservation actions including nonnative fish suppression and flow experiments designed to benefit nearshore habitats and encourage juvenile fish recruitment, have been underway to recover the endangered humpback chub (Gila cypha). Yet the responses in the population dynamics of both native and nonnative fishes to these conservation actions have been equivocal; environmental variability and ecosystem complexity have sometimes confounded the interpretation of results. Two recent experimental conservation actions have been implemented in tributaries within Grand Canyon National Park including the intensive stream-wide suppression of nonnative brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Bright Angel Creek, and translocations of humpback chub. The aim of these actions is to enhance resiliency and redundancy of the Grand Canyon humpback chub population, reduce the risk of predation by nonnative salmonids, and enhance native fish populations. Translocations are conducted in three tributaries of differing physical and biological attributes, following nonnative fish suppression. The objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy of these efforts in restoring native fish communities and establishing reproducing populations of humpback chub, by 1) quantifying the effects of nonnative suppression and environmental variability on demographic vital rates (i.e., survival, recruitment, mortality) of native fishes and introduced salmonids; 2) assessing factors contributing to the likelihood of establishing self-sustaining humpback chub populations in small Colorado River tributaries; and, 3) developing an integrated population model for brown trout to quantify future levels of suppression necessary to reduce or eradicate the population in the Grand Canyon and beyond. Through detailed evaluations of humpback chub vital rates in translocated populations, plans for the reestablishment of the species in the Upper Colorado River Basin may be more-informed. Detailed examination of the response of brown trout, one of the most destructive invaders introduced across the globe, will assist fisheries managers in designing mechanical control strategies where eradication through chemical means is not a socially or logistically acceptable option. || The predominantly endemic fishes of the American Southwest are highly imperiled due to pervasive hydrologic alteration of aquatic habitats through river regulation and human water use, compounded by the widespread introduction of nonnative competitors and predators.

Because of this potential benefit, oxbow restoration was recently adopted by the Science Advisory Team of the Iowa Nutrient Research Center (INRC) as an approved conservation practice, which will accelerate its proliferation on the landscape. The nutrient reduction effectiveness of these restored oxbows depends on their interception of tile drainage before it reaches natural waterways, and future oxbows restored under the INRC program will be fed by tiles. However, an important and as yet unanswered question is whether introduction of tile drainage will affect the conservation benefits of restored oxbows. Numerous agencies are partners in this research and will benefit from its results, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, The Nature Conservancy, The Iowa Soybean Association, and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.

Although there is existing information on their basic habitat and life histories, there are many critical data gaps. These pelagic spawners release semi-buoyant eggs in the water column and rely on floodplain connectivity for rearing, after drifting downstream and being retained in available habitats.

For most Wyoming crayfish species, abundance and population status is unknown. Crayfish can play an important positive role in ecosystems through consuming detritus and serving as forage food for fish, but nonnative species, such as rusty crayfish, can have serious negative effects. An understanding of native crayfish distribution and early detection of nonnative crayfish is critical for management and control. In collaboration with Wyoming Game and Fish Department we are updating Wyoming crayfish distributions to refine range maps and species of conservation need rank. A better understanding of crayfish ecology is crucial for preserving native species and preventing nonnative species introduction. || Many North American crayfishes are highly imperiled with an estimated 48% at some level of extinction risk.

Shifts in the frequency and intensity of those cycles due to global change, in conjunction with anthropogenic alterations, are affecting the resilience of coastal habitats and the species that rely on them. This research will integrate existing approaches with novel techniques to examine the coupling of oceanographic and onshore processes and their effects on sea turtle nest incubation and dune stabilization. Sea turtles nest in a variety of beach environments, and the success of an individual nest is influenced by its location on the beach and the resulting incubation micro-environment. The effects of tide-driven gas exchange on sea turtle nest incubation, beach microbial communities, and dune stabilization have received little attention. Our recent research indicates that incursion and retreat of the saltwater wedge causes substantial movement of gases through the beach during the tidal cycle, and that alterations like beach nourishment have the potential to suppress this natural pumping effect. We will evaluate how nest incubation dynamics and productivity respond to altered gaseous environments. Additionally, we will examine the role of beach nourishment in shifting offshore/onshore organic matter budgets, and the implications for greenhouse gas emissions. The results of this work will identify how and where habitat suitability issues might arise, and inform sound conservation planning measures and better nourishment practices, including mitigation and alternative actions. || Florida's coastline is constantly reworked by long and short-term climatic cycles.

Due to a complex life history, determining population size within a particular river is logistically difficult. Sampling river-resident juveniles is therefore a practical method for investigating long-term population trends. The project is being conducted by the University of Georgia and is funded by the National Marine Fisheries Service as well as the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources at UGA. Three abundance estimation methods, which will consider different components of the capture data including spatial information, environmental covariates, and varying effort, will be used to estimate age-1 abundance of Atlantic Sturgeon in the Altamaha River, Georgia. Comparing the precision of these methods will improve future population estimates as well as give insight into the abiotic factors affecting recruitment variability within Atlantic Sturgeon populations. | | |[ Assessing Actively Poached Galax Populations to Inform Restoration and Law Enforcement ](/coopunits/project/203189098496/irwin) | December 2021 || This project is a partnership with the National Parks Service, the Appalachian Highlands Monitoring Network, as well as the University of Georgia and USGS.

When different stocks have varying levels of abundance, productivity, and vulnerability to fishing pressure, fishery managers often are faced with the competing objectives of protecting the more vulnerable stocks while maximizing sustainable harvest on remaining healthy stocks. The challenges associated with managing a mixed-stock fishery are typified by the Columbia River fall-run Chinook fishery at the mouth. The fishery includes numerous fall-run stocks with eight separate fall-run management components, including two protected stocks: Snake River wild brights and Lower Columbia River tules. The recreational fishery is an important economic benefit to the surrounding communities, generating over $25M/year depending on season length.To further complicate the management, a growing number of the recreational anglers believe that they can identify tule Chinook from upriver brights and purport to release an unknown portion of their catch (those identified as tules) to ensure that the season is open as long as possible. Thus, management of the fishery requires reliable estimates of in-season harvest, while taking into account changes in angler behavior. Our objectives are to develop the tools (including novel assessment methods and regulatory options) and systemic understanding necessary to promote effective management of the mixed-stock fishery in the face of existing conservation priorities and changing angler behavior. || Mixed-stock fisheries are notoriously difficult to manage.

Mountain sagebrush landscapes include other woody habitat like denser conifer stands at the periphery of conifer removal areas. Conifer removal can create artificial 'hard' edges that might yield high predation near the edges both inside and outside the conifer. This could even create ecological traps, where abundances are high but breeding productivity creates population sinks that yield declining populations near the edges in both habitats. We will examine: 1) abundance and reproductive output of sagebrush-obligate songbirds in sagebrush habitat in Sage-grouse core areas and including some active leks without versus with conifer removal, 2) abundance and reproductive output of conifer-dependent songbirds in adjacent conifer stands, 3) the change in songbird species composition from conifer to sagebrush habitats, and 4) impacts of distance from woody vegetation on nesting success and population trajectories (i.e., lambda) of songbirds. This information will inform the management removal of conifer trees located in stands of mountain big sagebrush habitats, and provide specific recommendations on the landscape contexts and distances from woody cover that will benefit songbirds the most. || Conifer removal is a core practice in sage-steppe restoration to benefit Elk (<i>Cervus </i>Canadensis) and Greater Sage-grouse (<i>Centrocercus urophasianus</i>) as well as other sagebrush species of management concern.

Seabirds were identified as one of the park's monitoring Vital Signs to provide critical information about trends in natural resource conditions and a Seabird Monitoring Handbook was created in 1983 to guide priorities and objectives for the Seabird Monitoring Program. This handbook was updated in 1988. Since then, staff turnover and funding gaps have led to an inconsistent effort in monitoring by the park. More recently, the Channel Islands National Park Seabird Biologist, in coordination with the National Park Service's Mediterranean Coast Network Inventory & Monitoring Program, has identified the need to conduct a scientific review of the park's seabird program. Furthermore, a recent monitoring plan assessment report by Point Blue Conservation Science identified seven focal seabird species plus one shorebird species to be prioritized in an updated monitoring program. The purpose of the project proposed here is to advance Channel Islands National Park's Seabird Monitoring Program by compiling all known digitally available datasets for the eight prioritized species and conducting species-specific in-depth program reviews following NPS guidelines and in coordination with Channel Islands National Park and the National Park Service's Inventory & Monitoring Program. || Established in 1980, California's Channel Islands National Park contains essential breeding grounds for at least fourteen seabirds and shorebirds.

The coordinator facilitates risk analyses, encourages collaboration on management recommendations, and ensures information sharing among stakeholders of biological invasions. | | |[ Response of Bachman's Sparrow to habitat management ](/coopunits/project/194333229056/mthistl) | December 2021 || We are conducting research to determine how Bachman's Sparrow respond to habitat management such as fire and thinning in a wiregrass-free ecosystem. || Bachman's Sparrow is a species of conservation concern that typically inhabits open forest systems with wiregrass; however, little is known about how the species responds to wiregrass-free ecosystems like those in South Carolina. Our research will focus on quantifying abundance, nest success, and survival of Bachman's Sparrow in these special ecosystems to provide insights into management of wiregrass-free habitats for managers. This project is in collaboration with South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. The results will help managers understand optimal burn frequencies and vegetation needs for Bachman's Sparrow and also provide additional information about the ecology of the species. | | |[ Monitoring of rock gnome lichen populations ](/coopunits/project/194333179904/dolan4) | May 2021 || We are working to develop a monitoring protocol to provide a status and assessment tool for rock gnome lichen. || Rock gnome lichen is an endangered species of lichen currently occupying the Southern Appalachians. Population monitoring for the species has occurred twice previously, but a consistent survey methodology is needed to monitor populations for 5-year status updates and potential delisting of the species in the future. We are working with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to develop a monitoring protocol to provide a status and assessment tool for rock gnome lichen. Our survey design will be implemented for future population monitoring efforts as well as inform ecology of the species related to the effects of Hemlock Woolly Adelgid on rock gnome lichen populations through vegetation changes. | | |[ Variation of Chronology of Wild Turkey Gobbling in the Upstate of South Carolina ](/coopunits/project/194045990912/jostroski) | December 2021 || We are researching the chronology of wild turkey gobbling in the upstate of South Carolina using point counts and autonomous recording units. We are comparing gobbling chronology in the upstate to other locations as well as looking at variation in gobbling related to date, hunting pressure, and elevation. || Wild Turkeys are an important game species but potentially declining in the Southeast.

Popular sport fish such as walleye are declining in many lakes, while warmwater species such as largemouth bass are increasing. However, not all lakes or fish species respond in the same way, even when they experience the same conditions. In some cases, local management actions such as restoration or protection of lake habitat can slow down or mitigate the negative effects of climate change on economically and ecologically important fish species. This project aims to understand how multiple fish species (walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, largemouth and smallmouth bass, and cisco) with different temperature preferences respond to climate change, and how their responses are affected by lake habitat conditions. Researchers will develop models to predict responses to climate change in tens of thousands of lakes in the upper Midwest. By identifying habitat factors that make certain lakes more or less vulnerable to climate change, this research will enable lake and watershed managers to prioritize management actions aimed at reducing the negative effects of climate change. At the same time, lakes where certain species are unlikely to exist under future conditions will also be identified, which will enable managers and citizens to prepare for shifts in fish community composition. Project results will be communicated to managers and the public using online data visualization and communication tools to demonstrate how lakes in the Midwest are affected by climate change and identify lakes where local actions may be effective in preserving cold- and coolwater fish species as the climate warms.<br><br>The project is a collaboration of researchers across multiple agencies and includes the University of Minnesota, University of Missouri, USGS, Wisconsin DNR, Minnesota DNR, Midwest Glacial Lakes Partnership, and Michigan DNR. || Climate change is influencing fish communities in lakes throughout the upper Midwest.

One avian species common to agricultural landscapes is the mourning dove (Zenaida macroura). Mourning doves are among the most abundant birds in North America and are familiar to the public. Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data collected during the past 52 years indicates mourning dove populations have increased in the Eastern Management Unit (EMU), where Mississippi is located. During 2017, approximately 225,100 mourning doves were harvested in Mississippi by 13,800 hunters investing 31,700 hunter-days afield. Research on mourning dove abundance and use of managed fields in Wildlife Management Areas (WMA) managed by the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) is ongoing. Study sites include WMAs where fields are actively managed using dove attracting crops and were selected based on records of variable hunting pressure and harvest. In Mississippi, some WMAs are managed with an emphasis on demonstration of field management practices for small game species, namely bobwhite quail and mourning dove. Study areas include Black Prairie WMA, Okatibbee WMA. || Dove hunting is a very popular outdoor activity in Mississippi, generating supplemental dollars in revenue for landowners. Research on mourning doves has been relatively limited in Mississippi. A limited amount of research on mourning doves in Mississippi has been conducted in recent years the Mississippi CRU. This included research on landscape changes around mourning dove call-count routes and banding studies assessing movements and survival. We are conducting research on abundance patterns and multi-scale characteristics of managed fields used by mourning doves on Wildlife Management Areas (WMA) managed by the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP). Study sites include WMAs where fields are actively managed using dove attracting crops and based on records of variable hunting pressure and harvest. In Mississippi, some WMAs are managed with an emphasis on demonstration of field management practices for small game species, namely bobwhite quail and mourning dove.

For example, state agencies and other water resource agencies rely on knowledge of stream and river fish communities for assessment programs, many of which have regulatory ramifications and implications for water and fisheries management and aquatic resource use activities. However, traditional fish community studies fail to accommodate potential interactions that exist among the entire fish assemblage and thus represent an overly simplistic view of community dynamics. This is important because treating species independently when quantifying and predicting their responses to changing watershed conditions ignores potential dependencies between species due to biotic interactions and can lead to erroneous predictions. Therefore, the overarching goal of this research is to help inform fisheries and water resource management and conservation by improving our understanding of the relative roles of fish species interactions, environmental factors, and how species traits influence a species' response to changing watershed conditions in Pennsylvania streams and rivers. The project is in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, and Penn State University. || Understanding and predicting fish community interactions and their response to environmental stressors is of utmost importance for fisheries and water resource management.

For incidental take permits for wind energy facilities, the USFWS has developed a peer-reviewed collision risk model (CRM) to predict eagle take at proposed wind energy projects. The USFWS has also adopted a formal adaptive management process for updating the initial take estimates based on post-construction fatality monitoring data once the wind energy project becomes operational. || Eagle collisions with turbines at wind energy facilities is a common occurrence in some areas of the US. If wind turbine collision-related mortality rates are sufficiently high, it could compromise population growth rates and population persistence. We are assisting the USFWS with conducting demographic analyses using the collision risk model, and then updating estimates with fatality monitoring data. These results aid in the issuance of incidental take permits to operators of wind energy facilities. Additionally, the USFWS is seeking to improve the models it uses to predict fatalities, and to use the data collected under individual permits to formally update the overall modeling process. Further, the USFWS is interested in exploring how covariates that might influence eagle exposure or collision risk can be incorporated into the collision risk model to improve the accuracy of, and decrease the uncertainty around the estimates.

Species distribution models (SDM) are highly valuable in determining critical remaining and potential habitats of at-risk species for conservation planning. Despite the proliferation of SDM and tools in the past two decades, management programs have not fully adopted them to inform species surveys and other monitoring efforts; instead, many rely on expert knowledge and other traditional methods to locate extant populations. One important framework that would benefit from SDM is the Species Status Assessment (SSA) developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. While the SSA considers multiple elements associated with species condition, including distributions, there are no standard requirements to estimate species distributions.

They are especially important to water storage, increasing livestock forage, and creating native fish habitat in arid western ecosystems. For these reasons, beaver translocations are becoming a popular method to enhance stream restoration projects (http://beaver.joewheaton.org). What was once controversial is becoming mainstream and accepted across diverse audiences ranging from ranchers to land managers. For systems where beaver have been extirpated or are not currently in, beaver translocation is a relatively cheap tool that shows much promise and has been used on and off over the past century. The concept of taking nuisance beaver from areas they are not wanted, and releasing them to areas where they can do restoration work is simple and compelling, and USU researchers have been pioneering techniques to make translocation more successful.

Integrated models (IMs) unite data from multiple sources that are informative about demographic variables. IMs offer several important advantages over analyzing single datasets by themselves. IMs can estimate parameters that are inestimable from single data sets and do so more precisely. Multiple datasets can also overcome biases present in individual datasets, thus leading to more accurate estimates. IMs also can make use of datasets collected for different monitoring purposes at different times and locations, uniting seemingly disparate information to offer multi-scale inference on population patterns.

Although there have been advancements in models informing the management of invasive species to reduce their impacts, few approaches are available that address the issue of spatially optimizing the allocation of treatments for multiple species subject to a budget constraint and that explicitly considers difficult tradeoffs. Structured decision making provides a framework for informing such complex decisions that is robust, transparent, and values-focused. We are using a structured decision making approach to aid invasive species management decisions, and are developing a novel decision tool that mangers can use to identify where and which treatments to apply for multiple invasive species that accounts for species-specific impacts, invasive pathways, and treatment feasibility. We are applying our approach to the management of invasive species in New York, considering alternatives for prevention, surveillance, control, and education. We are working with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC)and leaders from the 8 NY Partnerships for Regional Invasive Species Management (PRISM). We are developing a tool that builds on the work of NY Heritage Program, NYSDEC, and others to help invasive species managers prioritize management actions based on species, areas, and projects statewide, with flexibility to tailor actions at the regional level. Ultimately, our approach will guide managers in determining which species should prioritized, where those species should be managed, and the best approach to managing them. We will also include metrics of treatment feasibility into the prioritization to ensure management dollars are well spent. || Managing invasive species across large areas often requires multiple objective decisions involving numerous species with a wide range of biological characteristics, impacts to valued goods and services, and a large number of treatment options.

Much work has been done on automated (\"machine learning\") methods of classification which produce \"sample class designations\" (e.g., identification of species or individuals) that are regarded as observed data in ecological models. However, these \"data\" are actually derived quantities (or synthetic data) and subject to various important sources of bias and error. If the derived quantities are used to make ecological determinations without consideration of these biases, those inferences which inform monitoring, conservation, and management will be flawed. We propose to develop the concept of coupled classification in which statistical classification models are linked to ecological models of species abundance or occurrence. In this new framework, classification (e.g., species identification) takes into account the local structure of populations, communities and landscapes and does not assume that where a sample is collected is independent of the class structure of the population, as all current classification methods do. The proposed work addresses a significant bottleneck in the utilization of data from new technologies for monitoring and assessment of populations and communities - the lack of formal statistical frameworks (which fully propagate uncertainty) for automatically integrating observed digital monitoring data to ecological objectives of scientific and management concern. This connection between digital data and ecological objectives has yet to be made, except as outlined in our proposal. The work is transformative because it provides a mechanism for directly integrating remotely sensed \"big data\" with ecological models while accounting for misclassification. With a coupled classification system there stands the possibility of fully automated data collection and processing systems. || Advances in new technologies such as remote cameras, noninvasive genetics and bioacoustics provide massive quantities of electronic data.

Typically, Andean bear inhabit natural areas with little to no human presence/activity, occurring between 200-4700 m elevation. Nevertheless, in Colombia non-protected areas have historically had a high level of human presence/activity. Consequently, Andean bear populations are isolated, and exposed to a diverse degree of human related threats, including human-bear conflict in the form of retaliatory hunting. Monitoring changes in the Andean bear population, and understanding their relationship with threats and environmental variables is necessary for informing management decisions.

Assessing the persistence of native wildlife, a measure of ecosystem health, in rapidly changing landscapes is challenging due to current limitations in methods to survey wildlife populations and analyze the resulting data. Population density is a metric commonly used to assess species status; however, estimating the density of species that are difficult to identify visually is challenging. Passive acoustic monitoring is a new survey method with the potential to provide quick and reliable population density estimates for species that are easy to detect acoustically; however, statistical methods that reliably produce in situ density estimates from acoustic data that are not dependent on human interpretation of call rates are currently undeveloped. We propose to extend recent developments in statistical models for other noninvasive sampling methods to the use of acoustic monitoring devices for density estimation by incorporating spatial information about the spatial structure of the population to produce estimates of call rate in situ, and in turn estimate density. In addition, we will expand on existing automated detection and classification techniques for processing the acoustic data which will allow us to incorporate information about caller identity into our estimates. As a case study in use of these methods, we are applying the methods to endangered gibbons in Borneo, Indonesia.

Consequently, greater capacity to conduct studies that support decision making associated with white-tailed deer management has been identified as an area of need. This proposal supports a Ph.D. student position at the University of Minnesota, housed in the Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit to conduct human dimensions studies on CWD, deer hunters, and white-tailed deer management. || Chronic wasting disease is an infectious disease of animals belonging to the family cervidae including deer, elk, moose and caribou. Since 2002, CWD has been found in wild deer populations and captive deer farm facilities throughout the Midwestern United States, including Minnesota. The disease is always fatal and represents a significant threat to the long-term health of wild deer populations, and the future of deer hunting opportunity where it is found. Identifying effective avenues for disease management is a concern for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Many of the identified solutions for CWD containment, risk management, and elimination require the voluntary participation of statewide deer stakeholders including hunters, landowners, and the general public (Minnesota Chronic Wasting Disease Response Plan, 2019). This project will support several studies designed to better understand hunter, landowner, and public beliefs about, attitudes toward, and perceived risks of CWD and their support of management actions and policies to address CWD in Minnesota. This human dimensions information will be integrated with ecological information to develop effective strategies to address CWD in Minnesota. Th expected outcome of the research is to help minimize CWD impacts on deer and deer hunters in Minnesota. | | |[ Evaluation of natural and hatchery-produced kokanee in Flaming Gorge Reservoir ](/coopunits/project/193048293376/mcquist) | June 2020 || Kokanee is one of the most important recreational species in western North America and it is also an important prey species for other species of recreational or conservation importance. Flaming Gorge Reservoir, Wyoming-Utah, receives a significant portion of Wyoming's hatchery production of kokanee. Unfortunately, little is known about the extent to which hatchery fish contribute to the population and fishery. We are working closely with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department and the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources to better understand the role of hatchery kokanee in the system. Results of this research will provide managers with information that can be used to efficiently allocate hatchery resources. We also hope to provide insight on factors related to the survival, growth, and ultimate recruitment of hatchery and wild kokanee to the population in Flaming Gorge Reservoir. || Kokanee is one of the most important recreational species in western North America and it is also an important prey species for other species of recreational or conservation importance.

Over the last 6 years, the MA Coop Unit has studied the impacts of drawdowns on lake littoral communities. Not only do winter lake drawdowns impact the hydrology of the lake, but they also cause unintended hydrologic alteration of downstream ecosystems. For example, in the fall during lake water level reductions, water releases cause higher flows than normal. In the spring during refill, flows are greatly reduced during a season when flows are normally the highest. There are general guidelines for drawdowns that include timing of drawdown, limiting maximum flows downstream during drawdown, and maintaining minimum flows downstream during refill; however, it is unknown the extent to which these guidelines are followed, and whether they protect downstream habitats and biota. <br><br>This project will build off preliminary work conducted by MassWildlife, the Massachusetts Division of Ecological Restoration (MDER), the Housatonic Valley Association, and the USGS MA Coop Unit downstream of Onota lake in Pittsfield, MA where we observed improved macroinvertebrate assemblages following restoration of flows in Peck's Brook. MDER has identified priority sites for streamflow restoration downstream of winter drawdown lakes and conducted flow monitoring using time-lapse cameras in 2018. We will also use lake hydrology data from 18 drawdown and 3 non-drawdown lakes in Massachusetts to guide site selection. For this project, we will monitor hydrology, habitat, temperature, and biotic assemblages in streams to assess ecological responses to winter drawdowns. || Reservoir water-level management in lakes not only influences lake ecosystems, but also downstream ecosystems. Winter drawdowns result in higher stream flows in fall during drawdown and lower stream flows in spring during refill, relative to lakes not managed for drawdown; however, the impacts of this management on downstream ecosystems are unknown. Quantifying the the hydrologic alterations and associated impacts to habitat and biota are critical for developing management strategies. This project is a collaboration between the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, the Massachusetts Division of Ecological Restoration, and the MA Coop Unit. Ultimately, the hope is that information on downstream effects, in combination with our prior research on in-lake effects, can be used to set recommendations for lake water-level management that can meet human needs while minimizing impacts to ecosystems. | | |[ Environmental factors controlling juvenile river herring productivity and emigration ](/coopunits/project/193043630080/ajfarrell) | May 2022 || This project expands on recent research on juvenile river herring productivity conducted at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass) by using a combination of lab experiments, field assessments, and analysis of spatial and temporal datasets to assess environmental factors limiting juvenile productivity. The results will provide an understanding the effects of abiotic and biotic factors on juvenile river herring growth, survival, physiology, and emigration rates, which are essential for improving estimates of productivity and developing strategies for conservation and restoration in response to climate change, habitat alterations and other environmental challenges to river herring populations.<br><br>The overall goal of this project is to conduct research to fill critical information gaps about juvenile river herring productivity and emigration. We will achieve this through two major objectives:<br><br>Objective 1. Evaluate limits to juvenile river herring productivity<br>a. Conduct lab experiments to test the impact of temperature, food availability, and turbidity on survival, growth, swimming performance, and seawater tolerance of blueback herring<br>b. Compare blueback herring growth in field enclosures with different environmental conditions<br>c. Assess abiotic and biotic factors associated with river herring productivity (density, growth, mortality) among lakes and rivers in the northeast<br><br>Objective 2. Assess factors influencing juvenile river herring emigration rates and timing<br>a. Assess timing and rates of juvenile emigration in lake and river systems<br>b. Compare biotic characteristics (e.g., size, age, growth rates) of emigrating and non-emigrating juveniles to assess factors influencing emigration timing<br>c. Perform analyses to understand how emigration rates influence juvenile densities in lakes, and thus how productivity estimates are affected by emigration events. || River herring [collectively alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and blueback herring aestivalis)] have been valued by human societies since pre-colonial times, but populations have undergone a dramatic coast-wide decline over the past five decades. Information on factors influencing freshwater productivity of juvenile river herring, emigration timing, and early seawater survival are needed to understand, predict, and mitigate population declines. This project is a collaboration between the U.S. Geological Survey (Conte Anadromous Fish Lab and Massachusetts Coop Unit), the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, and the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries. Results of this research will be used to inform population models for river herring stock assessment and decisions related to federal listing of river herring under the Endangered Species Act and management decisions toward restoring river herring in the northeast. | | |[ Exploring assumptions of community occupancy models in stream systems ](/coopunits/project/193031161856/lbayer) | May 2023 || Occupancy analyses provide a sufficient tool to determine the distribution and abundance of species across a landscape as well as how certain habitat and environmental factors could affect that species.

Food chain length indicatestells the number of trophic transfers that occur from the basal resources to the top predator (1) and it. The length of the food chain determines the amount of energy movement with the system (2). Additionally, the food chain length can impact the amount of carbon fixation by the system, with top predators determining and altering biogeochemical processes and atmospheric interactions (3), and nutrient cycling (4). One theory for the length of food webs is that they are determined by the stability of the system, with systems showingwith frequent or extreme disturbances hypothesized to have shorter food webs (5). Streams are a dynamic systems with varying amounts of disturbance. Based on the dynamic stability hypothesis, streams with less stable flow regimes should have shorter food chain lengths than more stable flow regimes. Understanding the impact of disturbance on food webs and community stability is essential as climatic patterns shift and anthropogenic disturbance becomes more intensive. Studies on examining the dynamic stability hypothesis have found inconsistent results, including that the trophic position of fish has decreased with disturbance (6), high flow and low flow events reduced food chain length (7), and that while the trophic base of food webs shifted, food chain length did not differ due to flow intermittency (8). In addition, the streams in these studies had different compositions, including: a combination of streams with non-piscivorous fish and no fish (6), perennial streams having piscivorous fish and intermittent streams having small fish or invertebrates as the top predator (7), and no streams having fish (8). The propsedis research will examine food chain length in runoff flashy and groundwater flashying streams along a gradient of land uses. Runoff flashy and groundwater flashy streams have similar mean daily flows, keeping ecosystem size similar (9). However, runoff flashy streams are characterized by having a greater variability in daily flow, a higher maximum 30-day mean flow, and a greater flood frequency, which are major variables is stream disturbance (9).

We examined this question in streams with two distinct flow regimes in the Ozark Highlands of Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. Groundwater Flashy (GF) and Runoff Flashy (RF) streams were sampled for fish and crayfish to assess the potential of refuge habitats in these streams facilitating colonization and extinction dynamics during drought, and whether that differed between flow regimes. We intend to incorporate use of refuge habitats during drought to assess the potential of refugia as a driver of metapopulation dynamics. This research will be useful for managers to assess which habitats and flow regimes should receive conservation attention. || An important question in conservation ecology is how fishes of conservation concern use habitats and persist in their environment.

The goal is to identify potential stocks for a breeding program, and identify characteristics of oysters to match to environmental settings. || On-going and predicted changes in precipitation and river flow from management impact key estuarine species such as the eastern oyster (<i>Crassostrea virginica</i>). Oysters act as estuarine sentinels, serving as indicators of change, and as ecosystem engineers, altering their environment and providing ecosystem services, including critical habitat and supporting a valuable economic product. However, an estimated 50 to 89% of native oyster populations have been functionally lost in the nGOM due to the combined effects of multiple environmental stressors (climate, extreme events) and anthropogenic activities (oil spills, river management). Yet, unique populations in areas of Louisiana not generally considered to provide good oyster habitat. In collaboration with Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and Louisiana Sea Grant, this project tests the performance of previously untested populations of oysters from Louisiana waters under different water quality conditions. The goal is to identify potential stocks for a breeding program, and identify oyster populations that will thrive under current and future water quality conditions. | | |[ Using parentage analysis to investigate the spawning and recruitment dynamics of walleye in Northern Wisconsin ](/coopunits/project/193004562432/lsimm290) | June 2021 || Walleye have undergone substantial recruitment declines in the upper Midwest, but finding casual mechanisms for these declines has remained illusive.

Mountain whitefish are an important ecological and recreational component of streams and lakes in Wyoming, such as the upper Green River. Historically, mountain whitefish were likely one of the most abundant sport fishes in the Intermountain West, including states such as Montana (Brown 1952) and Wyoming. Mountain whitefish prey on a variety of aquatic taxa and terrestrial insects (Brown 1971; Pontius and Parker 1973; Scott and Crossman 1973). Therefore, mountain whitefish often compose a large portion of the biomass present within streams and lakes and likely contribute substantially to ecosystem processes (e.g., nutrient cycling). Additionally, mountain whitefish contribute to the diets of avian predators such as osprey (Van Daele and Van Daele 1982) and terrestrial predators such as river otters (Melquist and Hornocker 1983) and mink. Mountain whitefish can be an indicator species with respect to the effects of global climate change on river water temperatures. For example, upper lethal temperatures for mountain whitefish have not been defined, but weekly mean water temperature tolerances were lower for mountain whitefish than rainbow trout and brown trout (Eaton and Scheller 1996). Finally, mountain whitefish are a native species that makes a substantive contribution to angler recreation in streams of western Wyoming, including the upper Green River. Status and trends in Wyoming's mountain whitefish populations are only perceived with a limited baseline for comparison, which is currently being established. A recently completed project by the Aquatic Assessment Crew of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department studied the sampling techniques for adult mountain whitefish (Edwards 2014). In addition, the project evaluated the reliability of data collected on mountain whitefish populations for assessing trends in populations. Despite the putative abundance of mountain whitefish in the water bodies of western Wyoming (Baxter and Stone 1995) and their availability as a sport fish (Baxter and Stone 1995; Scott and Crossman 1973), relatively little is known about the ecology of mountain whitefish in Wyoming. Fish population monitoring programs in Wyoming have only recently targeted mountain whitefish due to a lack of methodology. Therefore, available data are difficult to decipher and potentially unreliable for identifying long-term trends. This is also the case in neighboring states such as Montana (Mountain Whitefish Summit 2009). Many of Wyoming's populations appear stable, however, at least some mountain whitefish populations nearby are showing signs of decline (Mountain Whitefish Summit 2009). In Montana, mountain whitefish numbers have declined in Hebgen Lake since the early 2000s (Mountain Whitefish Summit 2009). Trend data are not available for the Madison River, but the Madison River Foundation and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks indicated concern over an apparent decrease in mountain whitefish. Thus, the Madison River Foundation, Trout Unlimited, NorthWestern Energy, and Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks funded a research project identifying life-history characteristics, habitat requirements, and factors potentially limiting recruitment of mountain whitefish in the Madison River (Boyer et al. 2017a). Interestingly, mountain whitefish moved downstream to spawning locations in the Madison River and it appeared that channel braiding was important large-scale characteristic in spawning site selection. Maturation and fecundity in the Madison River population were similar to other populations, and reproductive development appeared normal, thus factors influencing recruitment probably occur post spawning. Age-0 fish were associated with silt-laden backwater and eddy habitats. Furthermore, age-0 mountain whitefish were most efficiently sampled with seines. The Boyer et al. (2017a) study added a considerable amount of knowledge to mountain whitefish ecology in the Madison River, Montana. Spawning characteristics and early life history are major gaps in the research of mountain whitefish ecology. Effective methodology for sampling juvenile whitefish is a concern of field biologists that is untested in many systems. It is probable that Wyoming could experience declines in mountain whitefish populations and would be best prepared to address potential issues by filling these data gaps. Declines in mountain whitefish populations were documented in a few lakes of the upper Green River drainage of Wyoming to date, and were attributed primarily to the addition of non-native piscivores. Riverine mountain whitefish populations appear to be robust throughout the state, but trends have yet to be identified. Factors limiting production of mountain whitefish may occur at various life-history stages; however, spawning success, abundance of spawning individuals, and early life-history survival can have a strong influence on year-class strength and population abundance. Therefore, identifying large-scale spawning locations and movement, age structure, age-at-maturity, spawning periodicity, and the distribution and habitat requirements of age-0 mountain whitefish will provide a strong foundation for understanding the population dynamics of mountain whitefish in large Wyoming rivers. Knowledge regarding the ecology of mountain whitefish is necessary before we can understand the mechanisms for potential population declines. Large-scale movement and habitat use by, and the spatial and temporal distribution of age-0 mountain whitefish within streams, is largely unknown. The most recent study conducted on age-0 mountain whitefish in the Madison River, Montana found that age-0 mountain whitefish were most efficiently sampled by seining (Boyer et al. 2017b). It is not clear whether the efficiency of seining is consistent among waterbodies throughout the species range. Therefore, evaluating appropriate methods for sampling age-0 mountain whitefish are warranted for varying waterbodies, and application of appropriate sampling methods to characterize the distribution of age-0 mountain whitefish in a large Wyoming river system may help identify limiting factors for mountain whitefish recruitment. || Mountain whitefish are an important ecological and recreational component of streams and lakes in Wyoming, such as the upper Green River.

The 3.2-m high rockfill and concrete structure can divert up to 730 cfs of water. Limited upstream movement past the dam was possible by strong-swimming fish species (white sucker, carp, goldeye, brown trout, shorthead redhorse, longnose sucker, flathead chub), but such passage was probably accomplished via the natural side channel on the north side of the island on the north side of the dam; the side channel flows primarily during high runoff discharges. Moreover, no upstream or downstream passage of marked individuals of most species present was observed. In addition, the dam appeared to limit the upstream distribution of a genetically distinct population of sauger; sauger formerly occurred in the Yellowstone River and its Clark Fork tributary upstream of Huntley Dam. Lack of access by this popular sportfish to habitats upstream of the dam may limit recreational opportunities as well as viability of this unique population. Huntley Dam was repaired and modified following flooding in 1996 and 1997. Concurrently, a nature-like fish bypass channel was constructed around the north end of the dam on the island to enhance fish movements around the dam. Unfortunately, the length of the completed channel was much shorter than originally planned. It failed to provide passage, probably because of excessive gradient and water velocities. The bypass channel was reconfigured to more appropriate design specifications in 2015, but its hydraulics and efficacy for fish passage have not been evaluated. Nature-like fish bypasses are designed to resemble natural streams or side channels. Their gradient is lower than that of typical fish ladders and their sinuosity and inherent substrate roughness provide diverse water velocities, especially along their margins, thereby ostensibly facilitating passage by a variety of species and sizes. Nature-like bypasses are still rare (though more popular in Europe than in North America) and only a few evaluations of them have been conducted. None of these evaluations were conducted in situations even remotely resembling the reconfigured Huntley bypass channel. As with all fishways, attraction is critical for nature-like bypasses; fish have to both find the entrance and decide to enter it before attempting to navigate it. Adequate flows are key to attraction, but insufficient evaluations exist to provide thresholds and design criteria, especially for diverse fish assemblages such as that of the Yellowstone River. Upon entry, a fish must traverse the passage successfully and also exit it; again, hydraulics must be appropriate. Failure can occur at any of these stages and assessment thereof is an important component of an evaluation if it is to identify causes of passage problems and possible remedies. Influential factors affecting bypass efficiency (depending on species and size) can include discharge, velocity, gradient, channel length, temperature, and turbidity. We propose to conduct an evaluation of the reconfigured Huntley fish bypass in 2019 and 2020 by estimating fish passage rates through the bypass and measuring and modeling the hydraulics of the bypass channel to determine its passability by various species under different river stages. Our specific objectives are to: 1) determine approach, attraction, and passage efficiencies (%) of important and abundant fish species through the bypass, 2) determine the locations of any passage bottlenecks within and near (i.e., immediately above and below) the bypass channel, 3) determine fish passage durations through the bypass, 4) determine the seasonal and daily timing of fish passage, 5) characterize the topography, bathymetry, and hydraulics of the bypass and its inlet and outlet to characterize its connectivity with the Yellowstone River, and 6) model the hydraulics of the bypass to identify excessive velocities, attraction flows, and other factors affecting fish passage over the range of flow rates that characterize the river's hydrograph. Completion of these objectives will provide an evaluation of how well the fish bypass works, ascertain the causes of any deficiencies, and identify corrective measures if needed. || The Huntley Diversion Dam on the Yellowstone River limits movements and distributions of fish.

Invasive species introduction and expansion is the second greatest threat to global biodiversity decline next to habitat degradation (Wilcove 1998; WWF 2016). Additionally, such introductions are recognized as a major threat to aquatic ecosystems (Ricciardi 1999; Pimentel et al. 2005). Invasive species disrupt ecosystems by displacing and reducing native species populations (Vitousek et al. 1996), usually through competition, predation, or both (Cucherousset and Olden 2011). Invasive species have the ability to initiate trophic cascades through the alteration of ecosystem food-web dynamics (Eby et al. 2006). <br>Lake trout have been intentionally or illegally introduced to over 170 locations in the Intermountain West (Martinez et al. 2009), often leading to invasive populations that disrupt food-webs in native ecosystems (e.g., Yellowstone Lake, Lake Pend Oreille, Flathead Lake, Lake Tahoe). Lake trout in their invasive range can predate on native fishes (Ruzycki et al. 2003), compete with native fishes (Donald and Alger 1993; USFWS 1998; Fredenberg 2002), and can affect terrestrial vertebrates dependent on native fish species (Spencer et al. 1991; Schullery and Varley 1995; Tronstad et al. 2010). <br>After being introduced from nearby Lewis Lake in the mid-to-late 1980s (Munro et al. 2005), lake trout were discovered in Yellowstone Lake in 1994 (Kaeding et al. 1995). Yellowstone Lake contains the largest population of genetically pure Yellowstone cutthroat trout in the world (Gresswell and Varley 1988). The effect of lake trout on Yellowstone cutthroat trout populations through predation and competition for limited resources in lake ecosystems (Syslo 2010) is of particular concern for conservation of Yellowstone cutthroat trout. The persistence of Yellowstone cutthroat trout in Yellowstone Lake has been threatened by the introduction of invasive lake trout, which have greatly reduced the abundance of Yellowstone cutthroat trout (Koel et al. 2005; Tronstad et al. 2010) and disrupted aquatic and terrestrial food webs (Tronstad et al. 2010). The number of spawning individuals in one spawning tributary was reduced from 55,000 Yellowstone cutthroat trout in 1987 to 500 in 2007 (Koel et al. 2012). Additionally, the decline in Yellowstone cutthroat trout abundance triggered a trophic cascade (Tronstad et al. 2010) and disrupted linkages among non-piscene predators throughout the Yellowstone Lake basin (Crait and Ben-David 2006; Baril et al. 2013; Tiesberg et al. 2014). The Yellowstone cutthroat trout population was expected to decrease by as much as 60% within 100 years if the level of predation exerted by lake trout was not suppressed (Stapp and Hayward 2002). Due to the dramatic influence of lake trout in Yellowstone Lake and the Yellowstone Lake basin, the National Park Service initiated a lake trout suppression program in 1995.<br>The original gillnetting program objectives were to remove lake trout from Yellowstone Lake and assess the geographic distribution and population characteristics (Kaeding and Boltz 1997; Ruzycki 2004). Subsequently, contract fishing crews are gillnetting in addition to the National Park Service to increase effort throughout Yellowstone Lake. The National Park Service additionally uses acoustic telemetry to locate lake trout spawning areas and concentrate gillnetting effort during the spawning season (Koel et al. 2015). Gillnetting effort has increased from 1997 through 2014 along with the cost of the program, which is now nearly two million dollars annually. The increase in gillnetting effort is showing some benefit; recently the catch of lake trout has declined and Yellowstone cutthroat trout numbers have slightly increased. <br>Research studies were initiated in 2015 to explore alternative lake trout suppression methods to increase the success of meeting suppression program goals, improve suppression efficiency, and reduce program cost. Currently, the most efficient and cost-effective alternative suppression method has been to suppress lake trout embryos using whole and ground lake trout carcass material and carcass-analog pellets on spawning substrates causing hypoxic conditions unsuitable for developing lake trout embryos (Thomas 2017). Carcass analog pellets are created from plant-based organic materials (gluten/soy) and were created to mimic lake trout carcass material. Addition of lake trout carcass material and carcass-analog pellets have increased lake trout embryo mortality in controlled experiments to near 100% (Thomas 2017; Figure 1; YELL unpublished data 2018; Figure 2) and could be applicable to suppression of lake trout embryos lake-wide, potentially increasing the long-term cost efficiency of the lake trout suppression program. However, with a concentrated addition of lake trout carcass material or carcass-analog pellets at lake trout spawning sites, novel concentrations of nutrients become available for aquatic organisms at all trophic levels that were not historically available. <br>The potential influence of concentrated lake trout carcass or carcass-analog pellet nutrients on the food-web dynamics in Yellowstone Lake is unknown.

Additionally, Underwood et al. (2015) revealed that genetic differentiation exists among Wind River tributary drainage Burbot stocks. Thus, the Torrey Creek drainage Burbot stock that occurs in Torrey Creek and Trail, Ring, and Torrey lakes is a high conservation priority (Figure 1). Managers have been concerned with the declines in Ring Lake Burbot since the 1990s. Burbot catch rate was higher in Ring Lake than four other Wind River drainage lakes from 1967 to 1969, and six other drainage lakes from 1995 to 1996 (Miller 1970a, 1970b; Krueger and Hubert 1997). Conversely, Ring Lake Burbot catch rate in trammel nets was lower than six of seven other drainage lakes from 2007 to 2008 and lowest among six drainage lakes from 2011 to 2013 (Abrahamse 2009; Lewandoski 2015). Additionally, spring 2018 Burbot catch rate in fyke nets was only 0.02/hour, compared to 0.22/hour in 1995 to 1996 (Krueger 1996; unpublished data). Hubert et al. (2008) also estimated that Ring Lake Burbot survival decreased from 77% in 1969-1970 to 56% in 1995-1996. Exploitation was not the cause of decreased Burbot numbers in Ring Lake (Lewandoski et al. 2017). Thus, the cause(s) of the decline in Ring Lake Burbot abundance remains unknown. Less is known about Mountain Whitefish in the Torrey Creek drainage. Whitefish abundance in Torrey Lake has been consistently low since the early 1950s. Only one mountain Whitefish was captured during 11 gill-net sampling events from 1954 through 1977, and zero were captured during nine gill-net and five trammel-net sampling events from 1980 through 2017 (Connell 1978; WGFD unpublished data). Conversely, high numbers of Mountain Whitefish have been captured in Trail Lake during the same time period, with the most recent sampling event producing a gill-net catch rate of 0.94 fish/hour (WGFD 2018). Available data suggest Ring Lake numbers have decreased since the late 1960s. Connell (1977) reported that gill net catch rate of Mountain Whitefish in Ring Lake averaged 0.29 fish/hour during five sampling events from 1954 through 1970, whereas catch rate during three sampling events from 1998 through 2017 averaged 0.07 fish/hour (WGFD unpublished data). Additionally, no Mountain Whitefish were captured in trammel nets (which are likely a more efficient sampling gear because of a smaller mesh size than the gill nets) during sampling events in 2005 and 2017 (WGFD unpublished data). A possible cause of the decline in Ring Lake Burbot and Mountain Whitefish abundance that needs further research is the introduction of Brown Trout and Lake Trout. Lake Trout were first stocked in 1937 and Brown Trout likely entered the drainage in the late 1940s or early 1950s (Connell 1977; Connell 1978). The origin of Brown Trout in the drainage is unknown. Immigration from the Wind River was the most likely source. Brown Trout stocking may have also occurred; however, no stocking records exist. Although no sampling data exist for the 17-year period after Lake Trout were first stocked, trend data indicate a gradual decrease in Burbot and Mountain Whitefish abundance in Ring Lake after Brown Trout became established. Brown Trout predation on Burbot was confirmed in the autumn of 2017 in Torrey Creek upstream from Ring Lake (WGFD 2018). Although sample size was small (n = 6 stomachs), Burbot occurred in 33% of Brown Trout stomachs (WGFD 2018). Torrey Creek upstream of Ring and Trail lakes are known Burbot spawning and nursery areas, and managers are concerned that fall-migrating Brown Trout into Torrey Creek may reduce Burbot recruitment through predation (Bjorn 1939; Williams 1959; Miller 1970a; Miller 1970b; Glaid et al. 2016). Mangers also suspect that Brown Trout predation on Mountain Whitefish migrating downstream from Trail Lake may be the cause of low numbers of Mountain Whitefish in Ring Lake. Goal: To estimate the predatory influence of Brown Trout and Lake Trout on the Burbot population and Mountain Whitefish in the Torrey Creek drainage || Here we are testing the hypothesis that the decline in burbot is a result of brown trout predation. This research project will provide information that will be used to manage the brown trout population in order to conserve the native burbot population in the Torrey Creek drainage. | | |[ Enhancing survival and condition of first feeding larval pallid sturgeon through diet ](/coopunits/project/192961159168/Molly.Webb) | December 2022 || Summary Conservation propagation facilities in the Upper Basin are currently experiencing variable survival of first feeding larval Pallid Sturgeon. This type of hatchery-induced \"selection\" can ultimately have unintended, negative consequences on genetic representation of Pallid Sturgeon returned to the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers, and managers are now investigating potential sources of mortality in the hatchery. Larval mortality is high at 19-21 days (at 16-18\u00b0C) and occurs as a result of starvation. This study seeks to determine if survival and condition of first feeding larval Pallid Sturgeon and successful weaning to a formulated diet can be enhanced by a diet more similar to dietary options in the wild. The results of this study can be used to develop a feeding regimen to enhance survival and condition of larval Pallid Sturgeon in conservation propagation facilities. Problem Statement and Background Conservation propagation is defined as the production of individuals for reintroduction in the wild, and is a critical component of recovery plans for aquatic species at risk of extinction or population loss (Paragamian and Beamesderfer 2004; Caroffino et al. 2008; George et al. 2009; Lorenzen et al. 2010). Conservation propagation has been used to successfully augment populations of multiple imperiled fishes, like Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Fast et al. 2015), and continues at present to be the main source of production of larval Pallid Sturgeon Scaphirhynchus albus in the Upper Missouri River Basin (Steffensen et al. 2010). USFWS conservation propagation hatcheries are currently experiencing variable survival of post-hatch larval Pallid Sturgeon following initiation to exogenous feeding, which directly affects the genetic lots that are returned to the upper Missouri River and potentially artificially selects the genetic composition of the Pallid Sturgeon population in the Upper Missouri River Basin. There is indication that the observed variability in larval survival at conservation propagation hatcheries is a result of poor response to feed offered to larvae. First feeding larval Pallid Sturgeon in a hatchery setting are introduced to a formulated diet (Otohime) at 3-5 d post-hatch, depending on water temperatures (Webb et al. 2006). However, recent research conducted on multiple species of fish, including several sturgeon species, suggests that first feeding larvae are not well-suited for a formulated diet (Parauka et al. 1991; Bardi et al. 1998; Mohler et al. 2000). First feeding larvae may not be adequately stimulated by the texture or appearance of formulated feed (Person Le Ruyet et al. 1993). However, because visual capabilities are likely not fully functioning at this early stage, chemical attractiveness of food is highly important (Iwai 1980; Kolkovski et al. 2000). There is evidence that formulated dry diets do not have the chemical attractiveness required to cue the taste and olfaction senses or initiate the preliminary stages of digestive processes that first feeding larvae utilize when feeding (Buddington 1985; Kolkovski et al. 1997a). There is also evidence that first feeding larvae are unable to properly digest formulated diets because of the digestive enzymes present at this stage. Lipase and amylase, the digestive enzymes present at high levels during the time of first feeding, process food sources rich in carbohydrates and glycogen, like the early life-stage zooplankton found in natural aquatic setting (Buddington and Christofferson 1985; Ricardi 2000; Ware et al. 2006). As larvae transition through the period of first feeding, the complement of digestive enzymes shifts towards greater levels of pepsin, which processes food sources rich in proteins (Ware et al. 2006). Formulated diets, like those currently fed to first feeding sturgeon, are high in protein, and, though digestible at a later period, may be too difficult for early sturgeon larvae to digest and assimilate (Ware et al. 2006). This can result in reduced body weight and larval mortality. Formulated diets have also been shown to result in high levels of larval cannibalism in Beluga Sturgeon (Huso huso; Agh et al. 2012). Enhancement of the traditional feeding regimen offered to first feeding larvae has been demonstrated to significantly improve survival and condition in multiple species of fish. In one study of Yellow Perch Perca flavescens and Lake Whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis larvae, chemical enhancement of a formulated dry diet was made through top-coating with liquid krill hydrosolate. Food ingestion and larval growth were significantly greater in larvae that received the krill oil-coated dry diet than those that received the regular formulated diet (Kolkovski et al. 2000). Recent research on sturgeon suggests that the addition of live feed (i.e., Artemia) significantly improves larval survival and condition (Ware et al. 2006; Agh et al. 2012). Additionally, Ware et al. (2006) found that a diet comprised of Artemia alone did not affect survival or condition differently than a diet comprised of both formulated diet and Artemia. This is important because it identifies a feeding regimen that improves survival and condition, is not as costly or time-consuming as a diet comprised solely of live feed, and potentially improves weaning success by enabling larvae to imprint on the dry diet. Dietary requirements of larval fishes are likely species-specific (Hamre et al. 2013). Previous research conducted in 2007 and 2008 on feeding regimens for first feeding Pallid Sturgeon larvae found similar survival (73%-92%) among larvae fed a combination of a formulated diet (Otohime) and live Artemia and other diets containing variations of either solely Otohime or Otohime and additional dietary supplements (Kappenman et al. 2011). However, in this study Artemia were only fed to larvae once per day, which is likely too infrequent to significantly impact larval survival compared to dry diets. Similar research on other sturgeon species presented live Artemia six times per day at regular intervals (Ware et al. 2006; Agh et al. 2012). Given the variability of survival of first feeding Pallid Sturgeon larvae at conservation hatcheries, additional research is necessary to reduce hatchery selection. || Conservation propagation facilities in the Upper Basin are currently experiencing variable survival of first feeding larval Pallid Sturgeon. This type of hatchery-induced \"selection\" can ultimately have unintended, negative consequences on genetic representation of Pallid Sturgeon returned to the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers, and managers are now investigating potential sources of mortality in the hatchery.

Ornithologists are thus interested in what choices birds can make when selecting nest sites to reduce predation risk. However, for birds that nest along an urban to rural gradient, the identity of nest predators is likely to change and thus birds must alter their nest site selections accordingly. Working with volunteer homeowners, Northwest Arkansas Land Trust, and the City of Fayetteville, graduate student Grace Christie and I are exploring how nest site selection, predator identity, and predation risk varies for 6 bird species that nest along an urban to rural gradient. Our results should inform predator-prey ecology theory as well as provide practical management applications for managers tasked with recovering birds that nest in human dominated ecosystems. Additionally, this study will allow us to address several important hypotheses in the predator-prey field including the \"urban nest predator paradox\" and the \"predator prolifieration\" hypothesis. || Nest predation is the primary cause of nest failure for most bird species and thus plays a crucial role in avian population dynamics.

Despite the dramatic decline, there is no clear censensus for why these populations continue to trend down so precipitously. One hypothesis that has yet to be evaluated is the influence of agricultural chemicals on the health and reproductive behavior of the Loggerhead Shrike. To improve our ability to conserve this Species of Greatest Conservation Need, we are evaluating the occurrence and impact of neonicotinoid pesticides on individuals. Together with Dr. Than Boves from Arkansas State University and funded by Arkansas Game and Fish Commission's State Wildlife Grant Program, graduate student Connor Gale and I are capturing shrikes and collecting blood and fecal samples from adult and nestlings that inhabit a variety of row-crop habitats as well as more natural grassland and pasture habitat. We are also capturing adult birds across seasons in these same habitat types to assess how pesticide concentrations and potential impacts vary between growing and non-growing seasons. We are also monitoring marked birds to better estimate survival and nests to assess reproduction. These results will inform management by state and federal agencies regarding how to conserve shrikes in human- modified habitats and may elucidate one of the major threats to population viability. || The Loggerhead Shrike is a grassland associated avian species that is one of the fastest declining passerines in Arkansas and North America.

Recovery goals have not been achieved despite substantial efforts, and there is a need to better understand the effect of various threats and ecosystem drivers on population dynamics. Three factors are of particularly high interest: 1) the effect of the quality of freshwater habitats used for egg incubation and juvenile rearing; 2) the effect of broad-scale ocean conditions on marine survival; and 3) the effect of predation by marine mammals. To characterize how these factors affect population viability, we will develop an integrated population modeling framework for spring-summer Chinook salmon by combining count and mark-recapture data. In this approach, data streams related to survival or productivity will be integrated with data streams related to abundance to estimate demographic parameters with greater statistical precision and less bias than would otherwise be possible. These models will use previously collected data to characterize the role of freshwater habitat, ocean conditions, and marine mammal predation on the abundance, productivity, diversity, and viability of salmon and steelhead populations in the Interior Columbia River. This research will facilitate evaluation of the benefits of past habitat restoration actions, will support decisions about future actions, and will provide an assessment of population viability. || Much of the historical abundance and diversity of Chinook salmon and steelhead trout have been lost in the Columbia River Basin, which led to the listing of many populations under the Endangered Species Act.

A delayed hooking mortality study will also be conducted to evaluate the mortality rate of fish that are captured but not harvested to allow better predictions of the effectiveness of restrictive bag limits. The above data will be evaluated with a population harvest model to determine the optimum harvest regulations for sustaining quality fishing in this fishery. | | |[ Determining crayfish invasion potential across the landscape ](/coopunits/project/192812240896/skbrewer) | December 2023 || Crayfish is a globally diverse group of invertebrates and one of the most important taxa in North American streams. Many crayfishes are identified as species of concern due to anthropogenic alteration, narrow distributions, and interactions with invasive crayfish. An estimated 48% of North American crayfish are at risk of extinction and widespread stream changes may result from loss of crayfish species despite their important role in stream structure and function, including a primary diet item of Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu). The project is a collaboration between the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation and the Oklahoma Cooperative Research Unit. We will compile existing crayfish data, determine the hierarchical structure of habitats associated with crayfishes, determine crayfish demographics, and determine factors related to the spread of non-native crayfishes within the Ozark Highlands ecoregion. These data are valuable for developing strategies for removal in possible locations, monitoring vectors if necessary, and developing important linkages between key prey and sportfish populations. || Crayfish is a globally diverse group of invertebrates and one of the most important taxa in North American streams.

Our project's overarching goal is to build interdisciplinary data literacy by combining emerging remote sensing and data analysis technologies into user-friendly tools for examining the real-world problem of population assessment of Maine's difficult-to-survey nesting seabirds that are facing threats in their coastal habitats that are critical to their persistence. We use Gulf of Maine colonial nesting birds as our focal species to develop survey, image collection and processing, and data analysis methods and technologies that are transferable to other taxa and survey goals. We are partnering with the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to compare nesting seabird data collected during plane-, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-, and ground-based surveys to examine effects of platform, sensors (type, spatial, temporal resolution), timing, and deployment approaches on species' detectability, counts, and behaviors. Our surveys will generate large datasets that traditionally require significant time for interpretation by observers. Automation of this interpretation and counting process potentially can increase precision, accuracy, and affordability of these surveys; therefore, we will use artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop detection algorithms to process the imagery we collect as well as selected archived imagery. Finally, we will create toolkits that include instructions for best practices of combining UASs, traditional survey methods, and automated analysis for conducting population assessments and a user interface that can be accessed by professionals and citizen scientists in applications requiring coastal wildlife monitoring. || Successful conservation planning is reliant on accurate information about species numbers and distributions and a workforce trained to use the best available science and technologies to gather those data.

Management of walleyes in Green Bay is complicated because walleyes spawn in many locations within Green Bay and its tributaries, but the importance of these different locations or regions to the overall population and fishery have not been determined. Specifically, walleyes spawning in the Fox River and southern Green Bay may contribute a substantial proportion of the fish to the overall population. Our primary objective is to determine if the walleye population in Green Bay is largely comprised ( 90%) of fish spawning in the Fox, Oconto, Peshtigo, and Menominee rivers or, if fish spawning in other locations within southern or northern Green Bay are important components. Additionally, we want to determine if walleyes spawning in Wisconsin waters contribute to the walleye population in Michigan waters, as the population as a whole is jointly managed by Wisconsin and Michigan DNR. Determining the extent to which walleyes spawn within certain tributaries or open-water habitats will help DNR biologists determine where habitat protection is needed to maintain spawning stocks and where habitat improvement and restoration might be used to increase abundance of some stocks. Our work may also help identify spawning habitats that were not previously known to biologists. Understanding walleye behavior and movement within Green Bay is also critical in determining whether current WDNR sampling of adult walleyes in these four tributaries provides useful estimates of abundance that can be used in determining predator-prey ratios within the LGB-FR ecosystem, as AOC delisting targets include recommended predator-prey ratios between 1:10 and 1:20.

Study blocks are searched for overwater nesting waterfowl nests and monitored for fate, with half of the blocks receiving predator removal and the other half untrapped. || Depredation is the most common cause of nest failure in waterfowl; however, nearly all studies on the topic have focused on upland nesting ducks. Several species of diving ducks nest overwater and cause-specific nest failure of these species is less understood. Managers that wish to increase nest survival and, hence, diving duck populations lack information to make decisions or understand best practices. Thus, this project endeavors to compare nest survival of Canvasbacks and other overwater-nesting species between areas where predators have been lethally removed and those where no removal has taken place. This project is supported by the Delta Waterfowl Foundation with field work in Manitoba, Canada and in collaboration with researchers at the University of Minnesota and Louisiana State University. Results of this work will allow managers to understand if predator removal is effective at increasing survival of overwater nests, as well as understand the various factors influencing nest survival. In particular, the role of redhead parasitism on canvasback nests is of particular interest. | | |[ Western Gulf Coast Population of Mottled Ducks Banding Needs Assessment ](/coopunits/project/192531943424/William.Kendall) | September 2023 || The mottled duck (<i>Anas fulvigula</i>) is a relatively sedentary hunted waterfowl species dependent on coastal marsh and other habitats along the Gulf Coast for its entire life cycle, and therefore especially subject to development and habitat loss along the Gulf Coast.

It plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy oak savanna by creating habitat for other species in live and dead trees. Historically, red-headed woodpeckers were common across the Midwest, but populations have experienced dramatic regional declines estimated at 67% since 1970. The situation in Minnesota is even grimmer: since 1967, this species has experienced an average annual decline of 6%, representing a cumulative loss of nearly 95% of the population. Although the rate at which red-headed woodpeckers are declining has slowed since 1990, populations in Minnesota do not appear to have stabilized. Our goals are to address population declines in a charismatic species of great conservation concern, to assess the outcomes of ongoing management and conservation efforts in an endangered ecosystem, and to develop a unified management plan for restoring oak savanna for red-headed woodpeckers and other oak habitat specialist species in Minnesota and throughout the Midwest. || The red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) is the flagship species of the oak savanna ecosystem.

The Interior Population of trumpeter swans (of which MN swans comprise ~63%) has increased dramatically since they were re-established in the 1960s and 1970s and both population size and distribution have expanded significantly in Minnesota since the MNDNR Alaska-egg project began in 1986. The original MN reintroduction goal of 15 breeding pairs and the revised interim goal of 500 individuals by 2001 have been greatly exceeded, with a current estimate of nearly 17,000 swans (an average annual finite rate of increase of ~1.20 since 2000). Better understanding of trumpeter swan ecology will be extremely useful in developing future management strategies for this growing population. || The Interior Population of trumpeter swans (Cygnus buccinator) was re-established through reintroduction efforts beginning in the late 1960s. Since that time, the population has exceeded reintroduction goals and now numbers more than 25,000 individuals with an estimated growth rate in Minnesota of circa 1.20 (i.e., a doubling time of ca. 5 years). As this population moves from rare to abundant across much of the Upper Midwest, a lack of information regarding basic ecology hinders planning for long-term management. In this project, we are marking Interior Population trumpeter swans with GPS-GSM transmitters to (1) Evaluate year-round swan movements, (2) Determine whether and where trumpeter swans make molt migrations, (3) Evaluate year-round habitat use and selection patterns of trumpeter swans, and (4) Evaluate survival rates of trumpeter swans, if sample sizes are adequate and fates (i.e., mortality events) can be determined. In addition, we are evaluating the current genetic structure of this population, and assessing environmental lead exposure. Partners include the University of Minnesota, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Canadian Wildlife Service, Manitoba Conservation, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the Wisconsin DNR, the Michigan DNR, the Iowa DNR, the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, and the Trumpeter Swan Society.

Several other Atlantic Slope drainage have encountered similar invasions in recent decades so comparison with Pennsylvania populations with those will help to predict what to expect moving forward with existing populations as well as in areas where they have not yet invaded. | | |[ Effects of commercial harvest on freshwater turtle populations ](/coopunits/project/188240551936/andrhea.massey) | December 2021 || Most turtle species are long-lived, mature at advanced ages, and have slow reproduction. These life history traits make their populations especially vulnerable to even modest levels of adult mortality. Despite this, commercial harvest of aquatic turtles in Arkansas has historically been unregulated and from 2004 to 2017, approximately 1.3 million wild aquatic turtles were commercially harvested, of which, 95% were taken in the Mississippi Delta ecoregion. Turtles are sold to meet global demand for use as food, pets, and curatives in folk medicine. At present, 10 species of aquatic turtles can be legally harvested with no daily or annual bag limits, no size class restrictions, and no specified harvest season(s). The Arkansas Unit, with support from the Arkansas Fish and Game Commission, is leading research to investigate the effects of commercial harvest on turtle populations and demography across the Delta ecoregion. Using a combination of population modeling and field research, the Arkansas Unit, leader by graduate student Andrhea Massey, is attempting to quantify the impact of harvest, assess the current population levels of turtles in the Delta, and explore potential management options to ensure the long-term sustainability of freshwater turtles in Arkansas. Results from this study will be integral in developing effective state regulations to ensure the long-term viability of freshwater turtle populations in Arkansas. || Most turtle species are long-lived, mature at advanced ages, and have slow reproduction.

Previous research has shown a recruitment bottleneck is occurring for age-0 walleye at or before mid-July. While declines in walleye recruitment are likely related to climate-induced changes in lake environments, the specific causes of this bottleneck remain unknown. As walleye recruitment has declined, adult largemouth bass abundance increased in many lakes. However, a previous study demonstrated that largemouth bass rarely preyed upon walleye in these lakes, although diet overlap for small bluegill and yellow perch was observed. Possibly, increased abundance of adult largemouth bass also indicates that abundance of all centrarchids has increased, but standard sampling gears used by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) do not effectively sample fish < 100 mm total length (TL), yet these fish likely comprise a significant portion of the fish biomass in many lakes. These small fish are more likely to interact with larval walleye through predation or competition for zooplankton resources. Yellow perch are also an important component of most northern Wisconsin fish communities, yet little information on perch population trends is available because targeted sampling for this species is not conducted. Specifically, data needed for indexing trends in yellow perch recruitment are not available. The objectives of this project are to determine if:<br>1) sampling precision, efficiency, and length frequency distributions of centrarchids and yellow perch varies among multiple sampling gears that might be used to target fish < 100 mm TL; <br>2) a qualitative index based on visual assessment during electrofishing accurately reflects overall abundance of centrarchids < 100 mm TL; <br>3) catches of age-0 fish in selected sampling gears are highly correlated with catch of age-1 fish the following year (i.e., age-0 catch provides a useful indicator of age-1 year-class strength); <br>4) current relative abundance estimates for centrarchids and juvenile yellow perch are related to walleye recruitment history (defined as declining or sustained recruitment); <br>5) previous estimates of centrarchid relative abundance in select Wisconsin lakes are associated with walleye recruitment history.<br>Sampling for objectives 1-4 will occur during August 2019 and 2020 on 11 of the 13 lakes that were used to identify the timing of the walleye recruitment bottleneck and will include lakes exhibiting declining walleye recruitment and lakes that have sustained walleye recruitment.

Shasta waterborne parasites in the Klamath River. || <i>Ceratonova shasta</i> is a parasite endemic to the Klamath River basin that has been linked to population declines in native salmonids. High densities of waterborne spores of the parasite are known to cause increasing infection and mortality risk for juvenile salmonids. A recently constructed population dynamics model for Klamath River salmonids, the Stream Salmonid Simulator (S3 model), includes a sub-model to simulate <i>C. shasta</i> disease and mortality risk for outmigrating juveniles in response to potential management alternatives. This sub-model uses inputs of spore density, however, spores vary spatially and temporally within years, and vary over several orders of magnitude among years. Through the development of the spore model, associations between peaks in spore density and the prevalence of infection in hatchery-origin juveniles were found. Developing models that are able to better estimate mortality risk for juvenile salmonids will provide a means to incorporate these models into the S3 model. This then provides an adaptive management tool for managers to understand how different management decisions (e.g. flow) might affect the population. The project is a collaboration of researchers between the USGS and the US Fish and Wildlife Service. | | |[ Juvenile rearing distribution of threatened coho salmon at habitat restoration sites on the Hoopa reservation ](/coopunits/project/186223974400/mhenderson) | August 2022 || A study to examine when and how Coho Salmon are utilizing creeks on the Hoopa tribal reservation using eDNA and snorkel surveys. || As Coho Salmon are thought to be at very low abundance in the study streams, relying only on visual observation and in-hand capture of Coho Salmon is likely to underestimate the extent of their distribution. Therefore, project sampling efforts will combine standard visual surveys (via snorkeling) with environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling (via water samples analyzed for presence of Coho Salmon DNA). This multi-method approach will also provide insight into the potential for eDNA surveys to evaluate small-scale patterns in Coho Salmon distribution associated with restoration activities. The Hoopa Tribe recently made substantial investments in habitat restoration and improvement projects to aid in Coho Salmon recovery in streams on tribal land. Results of this project will provide information necessary to assess Coho Salmon use of restored and unrestored sites to guide future restoration efforts. This project is a collaboration between the Hoopa tribe, USGS, and Humboldt State University. | | |[ Bat Conservation and Recovery in Nebraska and Wyoming ](/coopunits/project/185104826368/cfill) | January 2023 || There are mounting concerns for North American bats due to continuing and emerging threats from disease, habitat loss, fragmentation, and wind-energy development. Although these threats are likely to increase in severity, there is an opportunity to improve our knowledge of bat occurrence and habitat use, to learn how landscape changes affect local bat populations, and to establish regional monitoring that can inform local and national resource management decisions. This is especially true across Nebraska, which encapsulates edges of several bat species' ranges.<br><br>We implemented the North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) in Nebraska to survey statewide bat species distributions and activity. Thirty-five monitoring areas were established across the state to sample with bat acoustic detectors each year, comprising about 120 sites, and involving about 100 landowners. Much of these data were collected by volunteers (citizen scientists); we were excited by our successes in building an extensive and reliable citizen science network for bat monitoring.<br><br> We documented 12 bat species during our monitoring efforts, including some that have experienced dramatic population declines in other parts of the country from the invasive fungal disease that causes white-nose syndrome. Some species we found statewide, whereas we detected other species only in certain areas of Nebraska. Overall bat activity has been generally greatest in eastern parts of the state, and least in central and southwestern parts of the state, perhaps an effect of fewer available tree roosts.

Given its importance and the reliance in North America on sportspersons to fund conservation activities (i.e., the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation), natural resource agencies invest substantial resources to manage angler-fish interactions to ensure long-term sustainability. Arguably, most of our current understanding and management efforts of recreational fisheries are directed toward larger fisheries in rural environments. These waterbodies are highly visible resources and often attract many anglers from long distances. However, we know less about anglers in urban environments and their behaviors locally at smaller waterbodies. It is important for us to understand angler behavior in metropolitan areas because the landscape is becoming more urbanized. We anticipate that urban fisheries function differently than their rural counterparts.<br><br>Project goals are to understand 1) the participation patterns of anglers on multiple spatial and temporal scales; 2) how participation patterns of anglers' influence fish populations and associated communities; 3) how management actions influence angler participation patterns and, in turn, fish communities; and 4) interactions and feedback mechanisms between and among angler groups and fish communities.<br><br>The project currently has eight study components.<br>1. Omaha Angler Survey. Anglers were interviewed April through October on-site at Prairie Queen, Schwer, Halleck, and Standing Bear during 2019, at Benson, Flanagan, Fontenelle, and Walnut Creek during 2021, at Zorinsky, Prairie View, and Lawrence Youngman during 2022, and at Flannagan and Cunningham during 2023. These interviews are intended to add to statewide angler survey datasets that are valuable for assessing changes in angler participation, catch, and harvest. These extended datasets allow for relational assessments of changes in angling participation while considering environmental conditions and management actions on large spatiotemporal scales. During 2019-2021, extrapolated angler effort estimates ranged from 1,100 hours of angling at Schwer to 34,933 hours of angling at Prairie Queen between April and October. Creel Clerks conducted 1,888 angler counts and completed 5,416 angler interviews during 2019-2021. We aim to use these datasets to improve our understanding of angler catch by building models with the capacity to predict angler catch.<br><br>2. Omaha Angler Effort. Anglers were counted at 22 public waterbodies in the Omaha area from February 2019 through January 2020. In addition, the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission continued angler counts at 10 of the waterbodies from April 2020 through October 2020. Angler effort was highly variable with most angler effort occurring in west Omaha. Larger waterbodies typically received the most fishing effort. Most anglers accessed waterbodies from the bank rather than from a boat. Half of the waterbodies surveyed received more than 20,000 hours of angling effort; four of these waterbodies received more than 60,000 hours, which is comparable to many large, rural fisheries in the state. Towl and Halleck received the most angler effort per unit of area, with approximately 7,500 angler hours per acre. This magnitude of angler effort broke a previous record set at Bowling during 2012. Angler effort generally peaked from May through July and remained low during winter months, likely given poor ice conditions.<br><br>3. Omaha Recreation Survey. Recreational anglers express a variety of behaviors and specializations, making angling forecasting and management difficult. During February-March 2020, we surveyed\u2014in collaboration with the University of Nebraska's Bureau of Sociological Research\u2014a subset of Omaha residents that purchased a fishing license during 2019. We used mail-surveys (email and pre-paid envelopes) with an intent to quantify demographics, behaviors, and visitation rates to Omaha metropolitan waterbodies (and other prominent Nebraska waterbodies) during 2019. Behavioral differences are evident across the Omaha area. We are using these mail surveys to also identify sociodemographic variables that might be used to predict days spent on recreational fishing, and to identify complementary or competing recreational activities to fishing. Participation in recreational fishing does not differ across the Omaha area, yet participation in other recreational activities (e.g., fitness and woodworking) does differ among anglers across the Omaha area. This knowledge will be useful to managers, as it will provide valuable insight on both understanding current angler activity and predicting future angler activity according to demographic characteristics and landscape changes (i.e., urbanization) across a region.<br><br>4. Understanding Variation of Recreational Angler Effort. Waterbody size (i.e., surface area) accounted for 60% of the variance in angler effort across 73 Nebraska waterbodies during 2009-2019. The relationship between the size of a resource and the amount of use the respective resource receives can be utilized by natural resource managers to produce broad-scale estimations of system use, guide the allocation of management resources according to expected system use, predict how changes in system size may affect the amount of use, and highlight how different user groups may interact with systems of various sizes. For instance, utilizing the waterbody size-angler effort relationship allows us to predict that anglers exert over 4,750,000 hours of effort annually on public waterbodies in Nebraska. The relationship between waterbody size and angler effort also differs based on how anglers access the waterbody (i.e., via the bank or a boat). Boat-angler effort increases at a higher rate as waterbody size increases compared to bank-angler effort.<br><br>5. Recreational Use of Valentine National Wildlife Refuge. Valentine National Wildlife Refuge is an important social-ecological system that provides a variety of recreational opportunities for visitors. Even so, we have little understanding of the types and frequency of activities that occur on the refuge and the sociodemographic characteristics of visitors. We used 789 completed surveys (from 2,251 distributed windshield surveys; 35% response rate) to understand participation and potentials for social conflicts and ecological impacts of hunting, fishing, and wildlife watching (including touring, hiking, photography, and environmental education) groups. The fishing group was the predominate group (78%) on the refuge from July 2017 to July 2018. Social and ecological intensities varied across lake types (e.g., fishing vs. non-fishing) and seasons, highlighting intense-impact areas and periods on the refuge. Accounting for the diverse recreational activities and social and ecological intensities will allow managers of Valentine National Wildlife Refuge and other social-ecological systems the ability to concomitantly preserve ecological resources, prioritize conservation efforts, and minimize visitor conflicts.<br><br>6. Lake McConaughy Angler Survey. Lake McConaughy is an important fishery in western Nebraska. We interviewed anglers on-site during daytime during April-October 2022 and during nighttime during April-May 2022 and 2023. These interviews were in response to public concerns surrounding potential overharvest of walleye during the springtime walleye spawn, especially large individuals that are economically and ecologically important in the walleye population. The intents of these surveys were to document the relative amounts of walleye harvested during these two periods and to document the demographics of anglers for these two periods. Catch rates of walleye for walleye-seeking anglers during April 2022 were 0.5 walleye/hour fishing during nighttime and 0.2 walleye/hour during daytime. Analyses are ongoing to compare relative differences in catch and harvest between these important periods.<br><br>7. Ogallala. Lake Ogallala (and its associated canal and rive) provides a unique trout fishery in western Nebraska. However, this fishery has limited resiliency toward invasions by the common carp that is established in the upstream water supply (i.e., Lake McConaughy). We are surveying anglers during 2023 to gather baseline data for use in future evaluations of management actions designed to reduce the biomass of the common carp population in Lake Ogallala.<br><br> 8. Economic valuation of recreational fishing. Economic values of individual fisheries are important pieces of information, especially for prioritizing management actions and allocating limited resources. We have teamed up with Dr. Max Melstrom, an economics professor at Loyola University Chicago, to develop a model to assign economic values for public reservoirs throughout Nebraska. || Recreational fishing is the most influential factor structuring fish populations, especially in inland systems with intensive fishing pressure. Even so, inland fishery biologists rarely incorporate spatial and temporal patterns into management strategies, possibly because little is understood about angler decisions to participate in the sport. This project is a collaboration of researchers across multiple agencies and includes the University of Nebraska\u2014Lincoln and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission. Information gained on angler behavior will be important for increased effectiveness of fishery management, as well as increased effectiveness of angler recruitment and retention activities. | | |[ Development and testing of low-cost GPS collar systems for livestock using commercial off-the-shelf parts ](/coopunits/project/181994850304/Jason.Karl) | September 2021 || Development and testing of low-cost GPS collar systems for livestock using commercial off-the-shelf parts || Development and testing of low-cost GPS collar systems for livestock using commercial off-the-shelf parts | | |[ Integrating satellite and field measures for improved grazingland management at ranch scales ](/coopunits/project/181994813440/Jason.Karl) | September 2021 || Monitoring of forage availability, utilization, and residual biomass is the primary basis for making livestock management decisions in grazingland systems.

Since there is little known about the pathophysiology of inland trout, management efforts have been implemented at many hatcheries to reduce the transfer of this bacterium to offspring during spawning seasons. One management strategy is the removal of all fish once <i>R. salmoninarum</i> has been detected. However, it is unclear if depopulation of positive fish is necessary to eliminate the bacterium and, in many instances, critical and sometimes irreplaceable broodstocks are lost. The Colorado native greenback cutthroat trout (<i>Oncorhynchus clarkii stomias</i>)<i> </i>is one species of concern because depopulation may endanger populations of critical broodstocks. We are proposing to assess the bacterial load of <i>R. salmoninarum</i> within parents and evaluate the vertical transmission to progeny and to assist in developing non-lethal management strategies. We also propose to evaluate the consequences of keeping infected broodstock in a hatchery and the potential for horizontal transmission to other fish within the facility. || Since 2015, several state fish hatcheries in Colorado have had positive detections of <i>Renibacterium salmoninarum</i>, the causative agent for bacterial kidney disease (BKD) in salmonids.

Although the fishery remains popular, several concerning trends have been observed in the last decade. In particular, catch rates and body condition of YCT have declined notably in recent surveys and other recent work suggests concerning changes in growth, mortality, and size structure. Collectively, these observations imply that abiotic and(or) biotic characteristics of Henrys Lake are becoming less favorable for YCT. || Henrys Lake is a shallow lake in SE Idaho that has long supported a renowned trophy salmonid fishery for Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout (YCT).

The project will: (1) Evaluate specificity and sensitivity of existing Chinook Salmon qPCR assays and if necessary design Chinook-specific (2) biweekly estimates of Chinook Salmon eDNA concentration using qPCR at the Kinsman site. (3) Evaluate the Chinook Salmon eDNA plume emanating from Iron Gate Hatchery (IGH) during periods of high, medium, and low flow. At each flow level water samples will be collected at IGH and progressively downstream at 10 km intervals until the Kinsman site is reached. These data will provide insights regarding the extent to which IGH eDNA output may bias estimates of natural-orgin smolt outmigrant abundance at the Kinsman site. (4) Statistical assessment of the relationship between the weekly eDNA concentrations and Chinook Salmon smolt abundance estimated using standard methods. Our study will leverage existing smolt abundance estimates in the Klamath River at Kinsman where weekly and season Chinook Salmon estimates have been generated since the early 1990s. The data from standard monitoring will provide a foundation for comparison of the eDNA-based estimates. Use of eDNA approaches for determining smolt abundance during seaward migration has at least three distinct advantages in comparison to standard monitoring. First, eDNA approaches are non-invasive in the sense that they do not involve direct handling and/or tagging of Chinook Salmon smolts or cause delays in their downstream migration. Second, eDNA approaches are less likely to be constrained by high water flows and debris that can result in flawed sets and/or make it dangerous for staff to implement field survey methods. Third, eDNA-based methods may provide a less expensive alternative for salmon abundance monitoring than standard methods. This study will provide eDNA-based estimates of weekly smolt abundance of Chinook Salmon within the mainstem of the Klamath River, but it could also serve as a foundation and justification for applying the eDNA methods in other areas within the Klamath-Trinity Basin and across the entire Pacific northwest where similar approaches are applied for salmon. Further, if the approaches developed herein are proven effective for monitoring Chinook Salmon, they could be easily expanded for monitoring of other commercially, recreationally, and tribally important species, such as Coho Salmon, steelhead, green sturgeon, and Pacific lamprey. Also, the same water samples collected for determination of salmon abundance could also be used for disease monitoring in the mainstem Klamath River, which is currently evaluated, in part, using environmental DNA analysis (Hallett and Bartholomew 2006).

These declines were attributed to the combined effects of hunter harvest, predation and interactions with stochastic climatic events resulting lowered adult survival and recruitment. In addition, changes in the predator community composition has led to other non-lethal effects with the potential to influence elk demographic rates. Baseline data on elk survival rates, cause-specific mortality and habitat selection is limited for periods prior to the reintroduction of Mexican wolves in New Mexico and Arizona (e.g., Ballard et al. 2000). Consequently it is unknown whether Mexican wolves are reducing elk population growth or if wolf predation is compensatory, additive, or partially compensatory due to a lack of appropriate data. The lack of data impedes the development of the most informed management plans for elk in the Mexican wolf recovery area. Therefore the goal of this study is to assess variability in survival, cause-specific mortality, movements and habitat selection of elk across the Mexican wolf recovery area in Arizona and New Mexico. Our specific objectives are to: 1) estimate seasonal and annual cause-specific mortality rates for elk neonates and adult female elk; 2) estimate seasonal and annual survival rates for neonates and adult female elk; 3) estimate seasonal kill rates and prey composition of Mexican wolves; 4) assess effects of wolf activity on seasonal habitat selection and movements of elk; and 5) model the likely population trajectories of elk populations subjected to varying cause-specific mortality rates from predators (e.g., Mexican wolves, black bears, mountain lions, coyotes) and other causes of mortality (e.g., harvest, illegal harvest, vehicle collision).

As marine spatial planning becomes a pressing issue in the region, data are needed to enhance our understanding of the seabird community in the South Atlantic Bight and the Gulf of Mexico. Although current ship-based and aerial surveys are the standard methods used to measure abundance and distribution of birds at sea, each is a population-based survey that provides information without regard to individual variability or colony of origin. We are deploying tracking devices to measure movement patterns of seabirds in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and western north Atlantic. We are collaborating with the US FWS and also with local NGOs and Universities throughout the Caribbean. Data from individual tracking efforts will allow us to assess variability in movements and use patterns, fidelity to specific marine locations, and the relationship between marine use areas and breeding locations and population trends at the breeding grounds. | | |[ Applying downscaled climate projections to inform decisions ](/coopunits/project/170500739072/kedowdy) | June 2019 || This project is designed to help prevent listing Eleutherodactylus species that are at risk of becoming endangered under the Endangered Species List. Eleutherodactylus species are of conservation interest, and are typified by high endemism, relative low vagility, and largely stenoclimatic. This project will address two objectives that will help the decision makers in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to formulate conservation measures. First, ascertain physiological thresholds (temperature, humidity) of selected species (biological models). This critical to permit forecasting species distribution in response to environmental changes and identify potential environmental refugia. Second, develop and test translocation protocols to either enhance populations via reintroductions or translocations to locations characterized by long-term suitability (refugia). Suitable areas for long-term conservation will be identified by combining physiological threshold information, downscaled climate projections (SE Climate Science Center), and a decision support tool to conduct habitat threats and risk assessments. || This project is designed to help prevent listing Eleutherodactylus species that are at risk of becoming endangered under the Endangered Species List.

Impacts of extreme events, like hurricanes, tornadoes, and extreme flooding, have immediate consequences, but also have the ability to alter habitat and animals far in the future by providing opportunities for exotic species to colonize new areas. Some fish communities in streams, rivers, and lakes may have the natural ability to resist the long-term impacts of extreme weather events. In this project, researchers will investigate the ability of Caribbean fish assemblages in Puerto Rico, which have both economic and cultural importance, to resist the impacts of extreme weather events. This information would allow natural resource managers on the island to develop appropriate responses to these events when managing fisheries resource. Furthermore, the project scientists will determine how changes in freshwater fish over time to hurricanes and other extreme weather events will impact the services (e.g., recreational and subsistence fishing practices) the fish will provide in the future. This work will not only deliver important information to fisheries managers and the community of Puerto Rico but could also be used by managers in other island systems. || Ecological disturbance and its impacts on organisms and ecosystems is a longstanding concept in ecology. Understanding and planning for the effects of disturbances, such as extreme weather events, on natural resources may help managers respond to the impacts of extreme events more effectively. The diversity of freshwater fish species in Puerto Rico may provide natural biotic resistance and resilience to colonization by nonnative species following disturbances; however this has not yet been studied in Caribbean island freshwater ecosystems. Puerto Rico provides an ideal study location to test this hypothesis in Caribbean fish assemblages and apply the results to other similar closed freshwater island systems. We propose to determine changes in stream and river fish assemblages over time at multiple temporal scales (e.g., seasonal, annual, decadal), examine fish assemblages and fisheries dynamics in relation to biotic resistance from exotic species invasions while relating changes to landscape (e.g., dams and reservoirs) and climate influences, project changes in fish assemblages and their ecosystem services in the future, and determine the impacts on the community and stakeholders. Through regular communication, written reports, peer-reviewed publications, and other tailored communication products, we will transfer our results to regional stakeholders to help guide strategic planning efforts. Climate change is predicted to increase the number of extreme events globally, and having a clearer understanding of the impacts of such events on natural resources will help managers develop efficient adaptation strategies and allocate resources appropriately.

Hydropeaking regimes used to generate electricity are known to cause disturbances in natural flow and thermal conditions. Pulses of various magnitude create dual waves of sheer and thermal stress which, in general, cause a decrease in community complexity, richness, and native diversity downstream of hydropeaking dams. As human populations increase and become more reliable on renewable resources, reducing uncertainty regarding how hydropower impacts natural ecosystems is important to State and Federal partners as well as other stakeholders interested in multiple uses of river systems.

However, while we know a great deal about the abiotic and biotic requirements of many game fishes there is a surprising lack of data regarding critical physiological limits of most non-game fishes. A metric that is commonly used to determine hypoxia tolerance of fishes is oxygen (O2) consumption (MO2), which reflects the ability of an organism to extract oxygen from the environment required to maintain routine metabolic rate as DO decreases. Fish species vary in their oxygen consumption and temperature requirements, even though they may coexist in the same river reach. As such, generating predictions as to the effects of temperature and dissolved oxygen variation on entire fish communities below dams is difficult. In addition, many of these fish species serve as hosts for mussel glochidia. Given that many mussels release glochidia during warmer months (>25\u00ba C) when fish have higher respiratory demands and are likely more vulnerable to stress caused by variation in water temperature, effects on fishes will also influence mussel communities. Because research is needed to characterize the dissolved oxygen and temperature requirements of ecologically important species, this project is applying respirometry to quantify the dissolved oxygen and temperature requirements of a larger number of non-game fishes in an effort to generate more general predictions that can be used to determine suitable conditions in waters below impoundments. Species from the southeastern US will be selected to determine if specific physiology requirements are linked to taxonomy or habitat requirements. These data will have immediate application to USFWS and other regulatory agencies for determining whether current DO regulations are appropriate for species of concern. Our findings and predictions will assist in decision making for specific projects (i.e., SHC, conservation design, and Alabama's Strategic Habitat Unit-SHU Project) and will be applicable to delivery of conservation actions relative to impounded river systems and habitats across the region and beyond. || Large instream hydropower dams are required to maintain a minimal level of dissolved oxygen in discharged water, typically determined based on the temperature and oxygen requirements of largemouth bass or other game fishes.

The diversity of aquatic organisms in the southeastern US presents a major challenge when trying to set reasonable and effective temperature and dissolved oxygen requirements. A temperature regime tolerated by one species may be stressful or fall outside the range of tolerance to another. An innovative approach-electron transport system assay (ETS)-has been recently proposed by researchers that could be used as a screening tool to determine and compare optimal and stressful thermal regimes among species. It provides a quantitative measure of the potential oxygen consumption rate of an organism if all enzymes function maximally and the relation between ETS enzyme activity and temperature may be used as an indicator of thermal tolerance for some species. Therefore this project is evaluating ETS as a screening tool to distinguish among organisms with varying tolerance levels. Results will be of great value to Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, USFWS and private dam operators as it will provide quantitative evidence as to whether measured temperature regimes below dams provide non-stressful conditions, especially for species of interest. These data could inform decisions for modification of flow releases in order to minimize stress to downstream organisms and inform decisions relative to flow regulations associated with dam relicensing. || The coupling of climate uncertainty and increasing water demands for multiple uses presents challenges for provision of suitable instream water quality conditions for natural resources.

Knowledge gained from this study will address the long-term conservation goals by informing husbandry practices, captive breeding protocols, and wild management of D. mawii. In broader terms, this study will contribute to our understanding of life-history strategies of herbivorous reptiles. | | |[ Green turtle spatial distribution, abundance and habitat models in the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico. ](/coopunits/project/170362861568/rherren) | August 2021 || Understanding the distribution and habitat requirements of threatened species is one of the keys to managing their recovery. Threatened juvenile green turtles (Chelonia mydas) recruit to shallow lagoons, bays and estuaries in Florida, yet, in many areas, we lack key information about their distribution, abundance and specific habitat requirements. A number of indicators suggest green turtles are recovering in the North Atlantic after centuries of human exploitation. However, the nearshore habitats they depend upon are rapidly changing through human-induced regime shifts and climate change. The Sea Turtle Conservancy, one of the world's oldest and most respected sea turtle NGOs, is collaborating with the University of Florida and the Florida Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit to study green turtles in the northeast Gulf of Mexico. The main goals of this research are to develop a habitat model that predicts green turtle abundance and understand their health, diet and movement patterns in the region. This work will inform federal and state wildlife managers on the important link between juvenile green turtles and their habitat in one of the largest remaining seagrass beds in the Gulf of Mexico. || Understanding the distribution and habitat requirements of threatened species is one of the keys to managing their recovery.

While research has examined how these stressors shape stream communities individually, we know relatively little about if, and how, these stressors interact to influence stream systems. We performed a set of mesocosm experiments and constructed a mathematical model that explore the compounded effects of drought, nutrient pollution and increased apex predation on a subset of Ozark stream community fauna. We found that each of the individual stressors impacts several aspects of stream community structure and functioning, and that stressors can interact in both additive and antagonistic ways. However, these interactions are context dependent, and can vary depending on geographic and temporal scale as well as trophic position. Results of this study can further our knowledge of multi-stressor systems, and be used to inform best management strategies that mitigate effects of multiple stressors on stream communities. || Drought, nutrient pollution and apex predation have diverse effects on stream community structure and function.

Lake sturgeon spawn in many locations within the LWS, and many fish make extensive spawning migrations into the Fox and Wolf Rivers and their tributaries. The contribution of different spawning locations to the overall lake sturgeon population is unknown at this time and this information is critical in developing management strategies. Specifically, identifying the contribution of different spawning locations to spearing harvest would allow managers to determine if this harvest differentially affects certain spawning groups or \"stocks\". Furthermore, little is known about the relative number of recruits that are produced at different spawning locations and this information could help guide efforts to increase recruitment at some locations through habitat improvement. Additionally, whether adult characteristics such as size and sex affect reproductive success remains unknown. This information could have important implications for harvest management, if the probability of producing offspring varies among fish of different sizes. Our objectives are to determine if: 1) otolith microchemistry can be used to identify larval and juvenile lake sturgeon hatching at different locations within the LWS (e.g., Fox vs. Wolf rivers, tributary vs. main river); 2) if differences in chemical signatures are consistent between otoliths and fin rays; 3) abundance of larval sturgeon varies among spawning locations; 4) if contribution to spearing harvest varies among spawning locations; and 5) probability of producing offspring varies in relation to size and sex of adult fish captured at individual spawning locations. || Lake sturgeon spawn in many locations within the Lake Winnebago System, and many fish make extensive spawning migrations into the Fox and Wolf Rivers and their tributaries.

The project focuses on developing spatially explicit models to explain and predict how watershed features, including BMPs, interact to influence upland sediment dynamics and instream benthic habitat conditions. This work will inform conservation planning for hellbender, fishes, and mussels by providing baseline data, validating protocols for water quality monitoring, and helping to prioritize implementation of future BMPs to benefit imperiled aquatic species. The project is a collaboration among USGS, USFWS, NRCS, and Virginia Tech.<br>OBJECTIVES:<br>1) Summarize available water quality data;<br>2) Complete our geomorphology dataset on channel topography;<br>3) Identify optimal locations for BMP implementation;<br>4) Test scenarios of BMP investment.<br><br>Our research focused on developing spatially explicit models to explain and predict how watershed processes and features, including agricultural BMPs, interact to determine instream benthic habitats that support at-risk aquatic biota in CCW. This required compiling baseline data on watershed processes and habitat conditions in the CCW, and developing BMP scenario analyses that linked upland management action to instream habitat outcomes. Results from this research can inform protocols for water quality monitoring planned to begin in 2021, can inform NRCS-WLFW on strategic planning and outcome assessment needs for aquatic partnerships, and have identified implementation approaches and metrics to use in CCW and other aquatic conservation partnership efforts across the region and country. We highlight four primary findings from our research:<br>The most cost-effective BMP scenario varied between the two target habitat metrics (relative bed stability and % embeddedness).<br>Benefits to benthic habitats could occur even at low adoption rates (i.e., 'high' adoption not required).<br>Scenarios focused only on cattle exclusion fences provided little to no benefit to stream habitats.<br>This investigation started to establish Copper Creek baselines for metrics to be used to set targets/goals for instream habitat improvement. || The aquatic habitats in the Copper Creek drainage (CCD) host 11 federally protected fishes and mussels but are severely impacted by fine sediments, likely resulting from intensive cattle-pasturing in riparian zones. State and federal agencies commonly promote and implement BMPs (e.g., afforestation and cattle-exclusion fences) to protect and restore riparian zones to aid recovery of imperiled aquatic species, but the efficacy of such BMPs is largely undocumented in the region. To aid in filling this knowledge gap, we used model- and field-based studies to establish links between watershed-scale sediment dynamics and instream habitat conditions relevant to priority aquatic species. We then assessed efficacy of selected BMP implementation scenarios with respect to outcomes for benthic habitat quality. Our partners included Natural Resources Conservation Service, US Fish and Wildlife Service, Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, Virginia Tech, and local Soil and Water Conservation Districts. Our findings suggest benefits to benthic habitats can occur even at low adoption rates of BMPs such as afforestation and cattle-exclusion fences.

We also hope to engage user groups in the research process, by working with them to collect fish needed for analyses, representing a significant opportunity for face-to-face outreach. Our specific objectives are to determine if: 1) lake whitefish and yellow perch represent important prey for walleyes in Green Bay ( 20% of diets by weight); 2) diets of these three species vary spatially and temporally and if diet overlap among species is evident; 3) the extent of walleye predation is sufficiently high to influence recruitment potential of lake whitefish and yellow perch and 4) extent of walleye predation varies among individual stocks of lake whitefish. Our working hypotheses are: 1) lake whitefish and yellow perch will not represent important prey for walleyes, but importance will vary seasonally and by location; 2) diet overlap will be relatively limited among species, with the exception of round goby; 3) despite low occurrence in individual diets, walleye predation will be sufficiently high to affect recruitment potential of yellow perch and lake whitefish, and 4) the extent of walleye predation will vary among lake whitefish stocks and will be highest for tributary spawning stocks spawning in southern Green Bay. || Green Bay currently supports one of the most economically-important recreational fisheries for walleye Sander vitreus in North America.

Our working hypotheses are: 1) lake whitefish and yellow perch will not represent important prey for walleyes, but importance will vary seasonally and by location; 2) diet overlap will be relatively limited among species, with the exception of round goby; 3) despite low occurrence in individual diets, walleye predation will be sufficiently high to affect recruitment potential of yellow perch and lake whitefish, and 4) the extent of walleye predation will vary among lake whitefish stocks and will be highest for tributary spawning stocks spawning in southern Green Bay. || Green Bay currently supports one of the most economically-important recreational fisheries for walleye Sander vitreus in North America. Lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis and yellow perch Perca flavescens also support economically-important recreational and commercial fisheries within Green Bay. Due to substantial ecosystem changes, including water quality and invasive species, all three species have experienced a tenuous history and collapse in Green Bay with yellow perch numbers remaining at historically low levels. <br><br>Our research will address the following research questions What is the status of the predator-prey balance, food web and aquatic habitat in Green Bay? Can tools and models be developed to better understand this complex food web while also engaging angling and commercial fishing stakeholders?<br><br>This project is a collaboration with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, Center for Limnology, and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.<br><br>: Our study represents an important step in a research plan that will help improve management of walleyes, lake whitefish, and yellow perch in Green Bay. Again, the goal of our research is to provide DNR fishery managers in Wisconsin and Michigan information on interactions among these three economically-important species. A better understanding of these interactions is needed to guide management decisions, because changes in population status of one species will likely affect fisheries for all three species. | | |[ Development of a landscape model to predict reach-level sources of Roanoke logperch larvae in the upper Roanoke River system ](/coopunits/project/170335997952/biota) | January 2020 || More complete knowledge of larval habitat associations and spatiotemporal patterns of emergence and dispersal regarding Roanoke Logperch (RLP) would help managers identify areas and periods crucial to recruitment, potentially making recovery actions more effective.

Three different migratory strategies have been observed in a mule deer herd wintering in Wyoming's Red Desert. These include long-distance migrants that travel 150 miles to the Hoback Basin for the summer (the longest recorded mule deer migration, named the Red Desert to Hoback migration), medium-distance migrants that migrate nearly 70 miles to the southern Wind River Range for the summer, and short-distance migrants that either migrate less than 30 miles north for the summer or live year-round in the Red Desert. Although these different types of migration have been observed for several years, little is known about the costs or benefits associated with each migratory strategy and how varying environmental conditions (i.e., annual precipitation, mean temperature) or landscape changes (i.e., fire, fencing) may affect each strategy or how a diversity of migratory tactics benefits the productivity of the overall herd. The primary objective of our research is to compare the costs and benefits of each migratory strategy (long, medium, short-distance migration). This study is being conducted as a collaborative project among the Wyoming Unit, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department and Bureau of Land Management. Evaluating different migratory tactics in the Sublette Mule Deer Herd is an important step in understanding factors maintaining variability in migration behavior and will aid in future conservation and management efforts. || Although migration is the most profitable foraging strategy in numerous systems, many migratory populations contain individuals that do not migrate - a phenomenon known as partial migration.

Along southern Wyoming, pronghorn (<i>Antilocapra americana</i>) migrations are severed by Interstate-80 (I-80), a nearly impermeable barrier to movement. The ecological consequences of this movement barrier has garnered interest in wildlife crossing structures to ameliorate this barrier effect to pronghorn and other wildlife. Our research utilizes a novel application of connectivity models to identify potential movement corridors across the I-80 barrier. This study is a collaborative effort with Wyoming Game & Fish Department and the Wyoming Department of Transportation. Analytical techniques will be used to model pronghorn movements across I-80 and to identify the locations that best facilitate movement, which we predict will be the optimal locations for a wildlife crossing structure. Our methods will have applied value both to managers in southern Wyoming, and in other systems where there is interest in how to restore movement across nearly impermeable barriers similar to I-80. || Movement barriers challenge the ability of species to make long-distance movements such as migrations.

No primary data collection is envisioned at this time. || Arguably, the most fundamental need for effective land and wildlife management is for managers to know the location - whether actual or potential - of the things they intend to manage. Species distribution models (SDMs) exist for most of Utah's wildlife species. However, these models are almost 30 years old, having resulted from the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (DWR) being one the first national collaborators to implement the Gap Analysis Program (GAP) in 1989. The need for credible, usable species distributions is the largest of 12 assessed data gaps in Utah's Wildlife Action Plan (WAP), affecting 82 species or well over half of all those in the WAP. The first-year cost ($25,000) would be borne by DWR and some its partners, while we envision that collaborators and other partners will cover future costs. | | |[ Development of an eDNA protocol for detecting candy, variegate, and Kanawha darters ](/coopunits/project/170323957760/biota) | December 2019 || Three species of saddle darters (Etheostoma variatum group) occur in Virginia.

Wind energy facilities have been demonstrated to pose threats to avian species through direct mortality and habitat loss. Wind energy development is increasing at a rapid pace throughout much of the developed world. Of avian species experiencing mortality due to collision with wind turbines, raptors appear to be the most vulnerable and may experience proportionally greater population level influences through direct mortality or habitat loss associated with wind energy development. This project is being funded by DOE Pantex. Our study will provide survival estimates, movement data, and habitat use data for juvenile Swainson's hawks throughout their migrations from Texas to Argentina and back. This will provide important data with which to understand and evaluate hemispheric level risks to the species and other similar long-distance migrant birds. || Swainson's hawks, a large raptor that breeds in the prairies and steppes of North America, both areas of high wind energy development, then migrate to the grasslands of Argentina (an area experiencing rapid wind energy development) in the Southern Hemisphere.

Through the implementation of mail-back surveys and group interviews, this project aims to understand hunters' perceptions towards a voluntary transition to non-lead ammunition use for hunting white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on targeted National Wildlife Refuges in the Northeast U.S. Specifically, this project aims to identify the practical barriers associated with a voluntary transition to non-lead ammunition use and what factors would influence hunters to switch. Assessment of the practical barriers to transitioning to non-lead ammunition will allow the National Wildlife Refuge System to direct targeted outreach and education strategies to achieve behavioral change in hunter ammunition choice. || Since the 1960s, the recognition of the negative effect of lead on humans and wildlife has resulted in regulations to reduce both human exposure and the amount of lead introduced into the environment. Federal restrictions on lead-based ammunition for waterfowl hunting were implemented in 1991. Since then restrictions on lead-based ammunition use have expanded in some states, however, lead is still a primary component of ammunition used for non-waterfowl hunting in the U.S. The continued use of lead-based ammunition for hunting white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), in particular, facilitates completed pathways to lead exposure for hunters, their family members, and for non-target species that scavenge the gut piles and carcasses of deer left in the field. Voluntary approaches to reducing lead-based ammunition use have been shown to garner increased support from hunters and have been recognized as a viable option for mitigating the impacts of lead from hunting activities. In collaboration with the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, USGS, and the USFWS, we have conducted mail-back surveys and group interviews with hunters at targeted National Wildlife Refuges in the Northeast U.S. This project aims to identify the practical barriers associated with a voluntary transition to non-lead as perceived by hunters, and what factors would influence hunters to switch to non-lead alternatives. Identifying the barriers and influences to non-lead use will help the National Wildlife Refuge System direct more targeted outreach and education strategies in order to better achieve behavioral change in regard to hunter ammunition choice. | | |[ Evaluating the use of redd counts in monitoring Snake River Cutthroat in Snake River tributaries ](/coopunits/project/170223247360/jbaldock) | June 2022 || Redd counts are a commonly used management tool for monitoring spawning salmonid population status and trends. The validity of redd count data as an index of population size is based on two key assumptions: 1. redd counts are representative of actual redd numbers and 2. redd counts reflect population status. These may not always be met, especially when there is substantial red superimposition, leading to biased redd counts. In conjunction with Wyoming Game and Fish Department we are evaluating the relationships between redd count data and spawning populations, spawning success, and fry emergence in spring creeks in the Upper Snake River drainage. The results of this project will allow managers to better interpret what redd counts can tell us with respect to population status (spawner numbers, fry production).

Desert riparian systems are distinct narrow drainages that provide (or have the potential to provide) conditions for vegetation and wildlife species dependent on permanent or ephemeral surface and subsurface water. Southwest riparian zones create nesting and foraging habitat for an estimated 166 bird species also support an estimated 10.6 times more migratory birds compared to the surrounding upland desert. Among these are species of conservation concern, such as the federally threatened western yellow-billed cuckoos (<i>Coccyzus americanus occidentalis</i>) and the (<i>Buteo plagiatus</i>), and zone-tailed hawk (<i>Buteo albonotatus</i>). It is also an objective of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to work toward the recovery of threatened, endangered, and high-priority species associated with riparian systems. However, little quantitative data are available for riparian obligate birds in the region. In 2018 we initiated a study to 1) assess the distribution, site occupancy, and community structure of avifauna among different riparian systems of the Trans Pecos region, and 2) to estimate nesting abundance and productivity of three state threatened raptor species. We anticipate our results will provide Texas Parks and Wildlife Department with data to make informed decisions for identification of priority areas for conservation and restoration, and assessment of status of species of concern. || Riparian areas in the Chihuahuan Desert Ecoregion are identified as a priority for conservation in the Trans Pecos region of Texas.

A small population at Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge sustained by captive-release is now one of the only known, non-captive populations of Wyoming toads. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recently improved captive facilities to allow regular release of adult Wyoming toads into the wild in order to foster increased reproduction and survival. This resulted in notable increases in reproduction, as evidenced by regular wild breeding, but changes in survival are questionable because the released animals are being observed less frequently than expected. We are collaborating with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to track the fate of Wyoming toads at reintroduction sites across the Laramie basin to assess the interaction among individual survival, behavior (e.g., habitat selection, hibernacula selection), genetics, and disease, with the specific goal of identifying how these linkages can be used to facilitate recovery of the species. Data collected will provide valuable information for the reintroduction and recovery of the Wyoming toad.

Urban trees, however, face a multitude of challenges from limited growing space, to invasive pests. To gain further understanding into emergent urban forest management issues, we conducted 50 qualitative research interviews with municipal tree wardens, from 2014-2016. Forest health emerged as an important theme, as interviewees (n=49) indicated that they routinely monitor for pests of urban trees. A significant number of interviewees (n=13) also indicated that they interact with urban tree committees. We will explore the potential for planting low-maintenance conifers, like Chinese hemlock, as part of an overarching urban forest health management and diversification strategy that incorporates host plant resistant species. We will also explore the characteristics and needs of urban tree committee volunteers. || With estimated losses of 36 million trees per year, urban tree canopy (UTC) cover continues a downward trend, nationwide. UTC cover losses are believed to result from a variety of factors including development, maintenance practices, and pests. Conservative estimates of national UTC cover benefits equate to $100 million per year, relative to carbon sequestration, pollution removal, reduced energy and reduced power plant emissions. These, and other ecosystem services, are enjoyed by large numbers of citizens living and working in urban settings, including an estimated 90% of Massachusetts' residents. To gain further understanding into emergent urban forest management issues in Massachusetts, we conducted qualitative research interviews with community-based urban forestry decision-makers, known as municipal tree wardens.

These negative impacts necessitate the importance of addressing deer overabundance. Regulated hunting is a widely accepted deer management strategy used to effectively reduce and maintain deer densities, although its use in suburban landscapes may be challenged by the limited long-term participation of hunters. Presumably, continued hunter participation is driven largely by participants' satisfaction with their hunting experience and highly controlled hunts in suburbia may restrict participants in ways that minimize satisfaction. Without a dependable suburban hunting constituency, successful reduction of deer populations will be challenging. A better understanding of suburban hunters' expectations, preferences, and limitations is of great importance if effective deer management programs are to be implemented. Our research effort is a collaboration between the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife and the U.S. Geological Survey Massachusetts Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Results of this study will give wildlife managers more insight when guiding communities through the development of management programs that focus on recruiting and retaining devoted hunters willing to considerably lower deer densities over time. || White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are abundant throughout Massachusetts, particularly in eastern portions of the state where suburban landscapes provide high quality habitat.

Since then, the black bear population has grown in number and expanded eastward across the state. However, current black bear density estimates in different parts of the state are lacking, as are population estimates.

Quantifying seasonal black bear habitat use and movement in relation to land cover in natural and human-dominated areas is necessary for understanding black bear behavior and creating effective black bear management programs. Estimates of connectivity are also required to identify important movement corridors, direct wildlife-road mitigation efforts, and predict black bear movements into currently unoccupied areas of the state. Our analyses are based on GPS telemetry collar data from over 47 bears that has been collected since 2009 by our Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife collaborators. Other collaborators on the project include the Massachusetts Department of Transportation and Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation.

A lack of access to quality hunting opportunities is often deemed as the primary reason why people quit hunting. In an effort to provide hunting opportunities for their constituency, the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission invests considerable time and resources into the development and management of public Wildlife Management Areas and private lands open to public access through the Open Fields and Waters Program. Although investment in these programs is assumed to fulfill the needs of the hunting community, evaluating the use of public or private land by hunters, and their overall satisfaction with the hunting experience is challenging. Currently, the majority of hunter participation, satisfaction, and harvest data are collected at coarse spatial and temporal scales, through post-season surveys. Unfortunately, this data does not provide the preferred resolution needed to appropriately manage individual Wildlife Management Areas or Open Fields and Waters sites. Moreover, it does not allow managers to assess the value of their investment in particular lands. The effect of hunting and hunter participation on wildlife populations, hunter recruitment and retention, and local economies is likely acting at multiple scales that are currently not considered when managing wildlife resources. Given the limited resources available for wildlife management, managers need a better understanding of hunter participation at the scales for which management actions occur if they are expected to manage lands appropriately. From 2014-2017 we worked with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission to assess recreational activities on more than 500 properties from eight focal areas spread across Nebraska. In total, we conducted more than 110,000 point-surveys that identified in excess of 11,000 cars. We also interviewed more than 7,000 users of publically accessible lands in Nebraska. Users represented an array of outdoor enthusiasts from 44 different states, with upwards of 80% of the fall users being hunters. We are currently analyzing the data to understand how users of publically accessible lands distribute on the landscape in the hopes of helping managers identify effective strategies for providing opportunities for outdoor enthusiasts in Nebraska. || The retention and recruitment of hunters is of increasing concern to wildlife management agencies nationwide.

With significant grassland and farmland habitats, Nebraska has the potential to maintain viable quail populations, but due to the climatic conditions imposed by harsh winters and periodic wet springs, quail populations in Nebraska tend to be highly variable from year to year. Local habitat management may be capable of overcoming some environmental constraints, but effective management strategies necessitate a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of large scale climatic conditions on Nebraska's quail resources. Although there are numerous studies focused on water constraints for quail populations in arid environments, the role of climatic conditions in driving quail populations in traditional temperate environments remains limited with much of the research conducted when the landscape was more conducive to facilitating population rebounds after severe weather events. Given the current agricultural paradigm, and predicted changes in climatic conditions, it remains unknown whether effective management implementation can lead to reliable quail populations and facilitate long-term stability in hunter engagement, satisfaction, and participation. In a first step to addressing this issue, we propose to identify the mechanism by which climatic conditions impact quail and the means by which management may overcome climatic constraints. Working with Nebraska Game and Parks Commission we aim to improve our understanding of how severe climatic events (e.g., snow storms, spring rains) alter quail physiology and behavioral decisions to impact population stability in Nebraska and to further develop management strategies aimed at offsetting these costs. Using an individualistic approach that considers the inherent trade-offs in life history, physiological, and behavioral expression, we hope to identify key constrains in population growth and management strategies that many ameliorate population cycles. || Northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) are among the most popular game birds in North America; however, the loss of suitable habitat has led to precipitous population declines throughout their range.

Agricultural development has resulted in the loss and alteration of habitat for many grassland bird species, and it has become increasingly important to understand how alterations across the landscape influence where birds reside, how they behave, and the subsequent implications for population and community dynamics. Because over 97% of Nebraska is privately owned, our research relies on the cooperation and participation of dozens of private landowners throughout the state, who work with us to understand how best to conserve grassland birds and their habitats. || Throughout the Great Plains, changing land-use practices are resulting in large scale biodiversity loss and an ever increasing dependence on effective conservation and restoration efforts provided by private, state, and federal agencies. Yet, too often management efforts fail to demonstrate the desired outcome for wildlife populations. Understanding why management is unsuccessful is paramount, but past studies often fail to consider the importance of ecological mechanisms that act across multiple spatial and temporal scales. By exploring how grassland bird communities select habitat based on local vegetative composition as well as landscape attributes, we can gain perspective on why populations and communities fail to react to apparently suitable habitat improvements. Using geographic information system spatial analysis tools, we are analyzing data from avian point count surveys and local vegetation assessments within a larger land cover layer of Nebraska. The resulting outputs are being employed to create species specific spatial models for Nebraska, which identify key focus areas to implement management efforts with the goal of maximizing management benefits to grassland bird communities. Working with biologists from the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, since 2011 more than 5,000 avian point count surveys have been conducted on State Wildlife Management Areas, private properties enrolled in the Open Fields and Waters program, and road transects. Analysis of habitat factors influencing upland species and other obligate grassland birds indicates that the surrounding landscape strongly affects local habitat suitability. Thus, the success or failure of on the ground conservation efforts may be determined by the landscape context. The findings from this study are now being used by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission to help direct pheasant management efforts in Nebraska. | | |[ Rainwater Basin Joint Venture Science ](/coopunits/project/170194309120/dvarner) | June 2019 || The Rainwater Basin Joint Venture's (RWBJV) mission includes science-based conservation efforts for all priority bird habitats throughout Nebraska's mixed-grass prairie region. The Management Board of the RWBJV is committed to implementing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Strategic Habitat Conservation model. This science-based model requires a commitment of resources and time to develop a strong biological foundation for delivering conservation planning and designing research and monitoring efforts. To fulfill this commitment, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln hired Dana Varner as the RWBJV Science Coordinator in October 2014. This position is the product of a partnership between the RWBJV, the Nebraska Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Unit, and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln School of Natural Resources, which provides office space and support in Lincoln. Funding for the position is provided by the RWBJV. || The Rainwater Basins are a critical wetland complex, providing habitat for millions of migratory waterfowl each year.

Nebraska hosts one of the world's most productive and efficient agricultural systems, the Platte River Basin. Like most agricultural systems characterized by high productivity and efficiency, its resilience to change is unknown. This training program builds upon strengths at the University of Nebraska, and joins the disciplines of agronomy, natural resources, computer sciences and engineering with policy studies, to enhance the resilience of agricultural landscapes to global - and local - change. Interdisciplinary training for Master's and Ph.D. students will enhance the type of team-building needed to address today's food, energy, and water problems, and trainees will engage with external partners from the agricultural industry, from state and federal government, and NGO's that have an interest and stake in maintaining productive agricultural systems. The traineeship program anticipates preparing ~50 trainees (25 Ph.D. and 25 Master's), including 23 funded trainees (9 Ph.D., 14 Master's), with a focus on hands-on experiences between the university and its industry and agency partners. Trainees will focus on key aspects of agricultural resilience specific to their interests, while receiving broad training in resilience theory as applied to working agricultural landscapes. This training will help develop a workforce and agricultural industry better capable of managing future demands on food, energy, and water systems. Currently the program is supporting ten students. This NRT program will focus on understanding resilience in water-stressed and energy-demanding agricultural landscapes and will utilize resilience and panarchy theory, adaptive management, novel sensing technologies and modeling, and policy interventions. Such training is rare in graduate programs in the United States, but is required to prepare the next generation of natural resource scientists, producers, managers, engineers, and policymakers to better respond to the challenges created by increasing demands for diminishing and interconnected resources and the need to maintain and build resilience in stressed watersheds. The University of Nebraska is recognized as a global leader in water and agricultural sciences; this NRT will explicitly integrate these disciplines. This NRT will train students in interdisciplinary science at the nexus of theory and application, and the intersection of sometimes completing, sometimes complementary endpoints of food, water, and energy - and ecosystem services - sustainability. In addition, this NRT will serve as the innovative foundation for a permanent interdisciplinary graduate program that will create a novel education program in the resilience of agro-ecosystems and ensure students, academic programs, local-to-federal agencies, and the private sector engage in building and preserving natural and agricultural ecosystems to meet local-to-global demands of water (in quantity and quality), clean energy, food, and ecosystem services. Moreover, this NRT will develop cross-disciplinary training for multidisciplinary cohorts of graduate students focused on the complex and intertwined ecological, technical, and societal systems involved in managing resilient water resources in the 21st century, in complex landscape managed for agricultural production. Further, the program will help develop innovative tools for data collection, analytics, and synthesis for decision support, management, and restoration of water-stressed agricultural systems within local-to international contexts. The program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The Traineeship Track is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas, through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs. || Understanding the components of resilience in landscapes is critical given the rapid speed of landuse and other global changes. Understanding the factors of resilience will allow for the management of landscapes such that they can absorb disturbance with out changing \"state\". This project is funded by the US National Science Foundation and includes collaboration of many state and federal agencies, including the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Nature Conservancy. The project focuses on training of students, and will enable the creation of a multi-disciplinary work force informed by current theory and best management practices. | | |[ Novel Ecological Uses for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-UAVs ](/coopunits/project/170193786880/allencr) | July 2019 || We have established a team of ecologists, computer scientists, and engineers who have been exploring novel applications of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology to ecological challenges. A primary application is the use of UAVs to remotely ignite controlled burns to help with management of grasslands, including the reduction of woody invasive species such as eastern red cedar. This particular line of work has led to the development of a prototype UAV. Prototypes have been utilized to initiate internal ignitions in a large prescribed fire in the Loess Canyons of Nebraska, and a very public burn at the National Park Services Homestead National Monument of America. Both applications were successful, and funding has been secured to continue to develop this technology. Additional uses include the development of a module to remotely sample invasive zebra mussel veligers (larvae). This application was successfully deployed for the first time at Offutt Lake, Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. In this case, as with prescribed fire, the development of UAV technology is enabling both more efficient and safe sampling (or burning), where safety is paramount and logistical constraints limit effort. || Both wildfire and prescribed fires present dangers to humans, but are natural disturbance processes critical for maintaining and managing ecosystems. A safer methods of ignition could allow greater use of fire in management, and safe human lives. With funding from the National Science Foundation, and collaboration with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission and agronomists, computer scientists and engineers, we developed an UAV to remotely ignite prescribed fires under a variety of conditions. | | |[ Managing Red Cedar Invasions of Nebraska Grasslands -Part II ](/coopunits/project/170190477312/dillon.fogarty) | December 2020 || Juniper expansion is an important issue, especially in the Great Plains, because ecosystem service provisioning is altered when grasslands are invaded by juniper. However, an assessment of the impacts juniper invasion has on ecosystem service provisioning is lacking. A central aim of this thesis research is to synthesize the impacts of juniper invasion on grassland ecosystem services. This synthesis will then be contrasted against: - How Nebraskan's value ecosystem services - How other invasive species in grasslands alter ecosystem service provisioning - How natural resource professionals perceive the impact of juniper invasion relative to other invasive species || Red cedar is an invasive species that degrades grassland habitat and reduces rangeland productivity.

The impacts of redcedar invasion in grasslands are wide-ranging, including reducing grassland bird diversity and abundance, decreasing livestock production by 75%, reducing small mammal and insect diversity, and costing Nebraska Public Schools over $2,440,000 from 2006-2016. The objective of this grant is to assess the vulnerability of Nebraska's grasslands to redcedar invasion, and develop predictive tools that enhance the potential to implement landscape interventions that (1) prevent the spread of redcedar trees or (2) restore degraded wildlife habitat following transformation to a redcedar-dominated state. || Red cedar is an invasive species that degrades grassland habitat and reduces rangeland productivity.

A characteristic of many biological invasions is a period of rapid population growth following introduction; management and control is most likely to be successful if it occurs prior to that period of rapid growth. By its scientific name, Juniperus virginiana or commonly known as Eastern Redcedar (ERC) is a woody species currently invading the Great Plains of the USA. Although it is native to Nebraska, it is spreading into grasslands and rangelands where it was not historically present and has the potential to seriously disrupt the local economy, including cattle production. Cedar can be controlled via regular burning to grasslands, which removes woody brush and revitalizes native grasses, however, public opinion of prescribed fire is uncertain. Because so much of Nebraska is privately owned, it is critical that the public understands the seriousness of the ecological and economic costs of cedar invasion, and the importance of properly managing both private and public lands. Cost-share programs provide funding that offsets the cost of and provides technical assistance for management which improves the environment, and engaging landowners educates them on local ecological issues and solutions, potentially educating their friends and neighbors, too. Joining a cost-share program is voluntary, so to increase participation, much research has been done to determine which incentives are preferred by the majority of landowners. Although these studies have discussed the social aspect of cost-share, they overlook the ramifications of structuring a program based on landowner preferences rather than ecological science. If cost-share management is at a smaller scale than ERC invasion, management will not be successful in the long run. The purpose of this study is to understand the perceptions of Nebraskan landowners in regards to ERC and ERC management, and the ways participation-based incentives influence the scale of management of Nebraska Game and Parks Commission cost-share programs which remove ERC, to identify where these programs are succeeding at their conservation goals and where improvements can be made. || Red cedar is an invasive species that degrades grassland habitat and reduces rangeland productivity.

Their significance is demonstrated through the ecosystem services they provide, which include seed dispersal, pollination, and insect population control. Within states whose economy is largely dependent on agriculture, such as Nebraska, ecosystem services provided by bats are of particular significance. Pest control services from bats are valued between $3.7 and $53 billion dollars each year in savings for the agricultural industry. This is largely because bats are voracious predators of nocturnal insects, including significant agricultural and forest ecosystem pests. Only a handful of scientists have done extensive research on the bats of Nebraska. Those who have been working in the state have provided valuable information, but gaps of knowledge do exist in the state. With a majority of the work that has been done being focused on netting-based data collection, the state could benefit from a wide scale acoustic analysis of all of the species present. This is especially important now given the impending impacts of wind turbines and White-Nose Syndrome (WNS) that have the potential to negatively affect the bats of Nebraska. The more we are able to understand how the bats of Nebraska live within the landscape the better prepared we will be able to protect their habitat, lower the impacts of WNS, and wind energy development. The North American Bat program (NABat) is a national protocol designed to streamline data collection and encourage collaboration across ecoregions in order to allow for broad understanding of bat ecology, populations, and habitat usage. This project used NABat to study the full range of bats found in the state of Nebraska, determining the habitat characteristics that influence bat presence and absence across Nebraska using a combination of stationary and mobile ultrasound acoustic detectors. A secondary focus of the project will be to determine the ability of mobile transects to detect shifts in bat population trends. The combined use of stationary points and mobile transects establish a framework for determining the distribution of bat species across the state. || Many bat species are declining, but methods to monitor their populations are poorly developed. This project implements the North American Bat Monitoring Network in Nebraska. Such monitoring may provide warning of population declines, and provides information to improve bat-habitat models. This project is a partnership with the USGS and the Nebraska Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit. This project will result in a monitoring program and citizen science program to monitor bats across the state of Nebraska. | | |[ Global Change, Vulnerability and Resilience: Management Options for an Uncertian Future ](/coopunits/project/170189479936/cproberts) | January 2019 || Our objectives for this project are to develop models to detect and assess ecological regime shifts in space and time, to identify components of adaptive capacity, and to identify species and techniques that may serve as leading indicators of thresholds of changing ecological regimes. We are utilizing monitoring and surveying data that is currently available in North America (e.g., Breeding Bird Surveys) with novel statistical tools and theory to assess long-term trends in the resilience of landscapes, changes in ecological regimes in both space and time, and species vulnerable to decline and extinction. We are employing various analytical and statistical techniques to quantify how core attributes of resilience (within-scale and cross-scale distributions of species and their functional traits) change over time in ecosystems and landscapes. Techniques used include, but are not limited to, stochastic modelling, information theory, and discontinuity analysis. Additionally, we will evaluate the significance of individual species to adaptive capacity, and thus the resilience of ecosystems and landscapes. We are conducting these analyses with data from the central United States with focal areas on Department of Defense managed properties, in particular Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, and Fort Riley, Kansas. || Ecological regime changes can be surprising and difficult to manage, and may threaten management goals Undesired regime changes can lead to species extinctions, and on DOD properties, can affect military readiness.

Without them, dynamic, adaptive change in response to disturbance is not possible. Novelty and innovation are required to keep existing complex systems resilient and adaptable, and to create new structures and interactions following catastrophic ecological or social failures. The importance of novelty is recognized in the management and business world, but is less explicitly recognized and appreciated in the scientific world. Without innovation and novelty, systems may become stagnant. Having a constant source of innovation and novelty is clearly important for systems, both following transformations and during their normal dynamics. However, novelty may be a destructive force as well. Invasive species, for example, can alter basic process and structure in ecosystems and be a source for decline or collapse. Cellular mutations can have obviously destructive consequences upon individuals and lineages\u2014cancer is a prime example. Thus, innovation and novelty can be a double-edged sword. In ecosystems, for example, novelty in the form of new species has been a cause of major extinctions, but is also the prime source for recovery. To explore the causes and consequences of the generation of novelty and innovation for humans, for social systems and for ecological systems, we will convene a small diverse group of researchers from diverse disciplines, with a variety of approaches and backgrounds, where we believe a deliberate focus on the concept of novelty could be fruitful. Our overall intent is to identify commonalities across disciplines. What attributes of a system are necessary if novelty is to arise? What might be the consequences, both positive and negative, of systems structured to permit novelty and innovation? || The conditions for the emergence of novelty in complex systems are poorly understood. Better understanding will help us better cope with a variety of phenomena, both good and bad (such as invasions and extinctions). This project brings together researchers from the Resilience Alliance with McDonnell Foundation funded researchers in the areas of complex systems, brain cancer and mind-behavior interactions. A book or special journal feature will result from the workshop that will be supported by this project. | | |[ Modeling with long-term datasets to inform management of National Park grasslands ](/coopunits/project/170188761088/brug0006) | December 2018 || Large ungulates in northern Great Plains national parks are of special management concern. This project uses existing data to better understand species interactions and environmental factors that influence ungulate population ecology. || Large ungulates in northern Great Plains national parks are of special management concern. Several parks annually acquire information on ungulate condition and population size, along with environmental data, and data on other herbivores. To date, these data have not been integrated into models or other structures that can be used to inform decision making. We used existing data to better understand species interactions and environmental factors that influence population ecology of ungulates and other grazers in the northern Great Plains. We conducted this assessment with collaborators in the U.S. National Park Service and the University of Minnesota. Results of this project can be used to inform management in national parks and other landscapes in the northern Great Plains. | | |[ Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) Prevention Program ](/coopunits/project/170187982848/kariedecker) | December 2022 || The Nebraska Invasive Species Program has facilitated development and implementation of a Nebraska Aquatic Invasive Species Prevention Program.

Understanding the relationship between temperature and non-native fish invasion for this southernmost subspecies of cutthroat trout will benefit all cutthroat subspecies as the climate continues to warm. We used a production framework to evaluate how temperature and competition with nonnative Brown Trout (Salmo trutta) impacted the ecological success of RGCT populations. We compared annual changes in production of RGCT populations and related these changes to the diets of RGCT in the presence and absence of Brown Trout across a temperature continuum. The rate at which a population collectively accumulates biomass is critical to population persistence because more biomass translates to increased reproductive capacity, increased competitive ability, and ultimately increased survival. We are working with a consortium of stakeholders that include two state agencies, eight federal agencies, two Tribal nations, three Pueblos, and three private groups. The project was funded by the U.S. Geological Survey, National and South Central Climate Adaptation Science Centers. Our results will be used by managers to identify and focus restoration efforts on streams with the greatest potential to support RGCT while maintaining an economical balance with a popular sportfish. || Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout (RGCT; Oncorhynchus clarkii virginalis) is the New Mexico state fish.

New, noninvasive methods for monitoring wildlife species such as genetic data from hair or scat samples, remote cameras, and bioacoustic monitoring, have allowed researchers to collect more abundant data than was previously possible. However, to estimate population parameters relevant to conservation decisions such as population density and growth rates, individuals must be individually identifiable which is only possible for small subset of species for which individual identities are easily determined such as the flank patterns of tigers seen in photographs or species that yield high quality DNA samples. The vast majority of noninvasive applications do not always provide an unambiguous determination of individual identity. Estimation methods that incorporate partial identity information have only recently been developed and have not been extended to accommodate most types of partial identity problems that arise with noninvasive sampling. Further, the importance of the spatial location where a noninvasive sample is collected in determining individual identity has only recently been recognized and this information greatly improves the utility of noninvasive methods and introduces new, more efficient, study design options. The key idea of what we termed \"spatial partial identity\" is that because animal populations are spatially structured, the location where a noninvasive sample was collected contains information about its individual identity.

Iowa's Canada goose population has gone from near zero to April population estimates that occasionally exceed 100,000 (Jones and Hancock 2014). At the same time Iowans perception of Canada geese has evolved from an uncommon and charismatic bird to a widespread species that is occasionally viewed as a nuisance. In recent years the estimated harvest of Canada geese in Iowa has exceeded that of mallards, an indication of the resilience and significance of this population (Raftovich et al 2017). It is critical that our monitoring and management keep pace with the changes this population is experiencing. An unexpected behavior of Canada geese post-reintroduction has been their exploitation of urban and suburban environments (urban and suburban environments will be defined as those within municipal city limits, hereafter referred to as \"urban areas\"). Canada geese were initially re-introduced in rural marshes and were thought of as a wary bird requiring abundant wetland habitat, specifically cattail marshes. However, Canada geese have successfully exploited urban areas in Iowa and throughout North America (Balkom 2010 and Beston et al. 2014). Conflicts with Canada geese traditionally occurred in rural areas, specifically on emerging agricultural crops. Beginning in 2012 this pattern reversed and the majority of nuisance complaints regarding Canada geese now occur in urban areas (Bunger 2016). The abundance of Canada geese in urban areas is resulting in novel problems that traditional management actions may not adequately address. The primary management action to control Canada goose populations has traditionally been recreational harvest (Iverson 2013). However, hunting is often limited in urban areas due to safety concerns and local ordinances. This may provide an opportunity for rapid population growth while at the same time geese become acclimated to humans due to their close proximity and artificial feeding by well-meaning citizens. This can result in a large goose population within city limits which may attract migrating geese thereby exacerbating the perceived size of the goose population. In these situations conflicts such as aggressive behavior by geese, fecal deposition, property damage, and vehicle collisions increase. Actions to mitigate conflicts can be controversial with varied opinions amongst stakeholders. In order to adequately develop management actions wildlife agencies require information on the ecology of Canada geese in urban areas. This information is generally lacking as the majority of research on Canada geese has occurred in rural areas. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Objective 1. Evaluate the movement of Canada geese captured in urban areas. Compare to the movement of geese captured in rural locations where the goose hunting season is closed. Determine the susceptibility of Canada geese captured in urban areas to hunting during the Special September Canada Goose season and the conventional Canada goose hunting season. Objective 2. Estimate annual harvest and survival rates for Canada geese captured in urban areas. Evaluate a three age-class model to estimate harvest and survival rates of Canada geese in Iowa. Where possible incorporate both live recaptures and dead recoveries to improve statistical precision and accuracy. STUDY EXPECTED RESULTS OR BENEFITS: The primary benefit of this research will be an increased understanding of Canada geese in urban areas of Iowa. This will allow the Iowa DNR to develop management actions that will mitigate conflict caused by Canada geese in this novel environment. The DNR is striving to find a balance between managing a valuable wildlife resource and mitigating conflict. The results of this project will allow for an update and re-evaluation of Iowa DNR's Canada Goose Management Plan (Jones and Hancock 2014). This project closely aligns with the first strategic goal identified in the Wildlife Research Section's Strategic Plan \"Iowa will have viable wildlife populations that are compatible with modern landscapes\" (Iowa DNR 2016). Results will also be applicable to other states and provinces of the Mississippi Flyway, many of which are experiencing similar conflicts. Specifically, the results of this project will answer questions regarding the movement of Canada geese in urban environments such as: Do geese captured in urban areas ever leave urban areas? Is there seasonal variation in the movement of urban geese? This project will also answer questions regarding the population dynamics of urban geese, such as a comparison of harvest and survival rates of urban geese and the statewide population. Finally, this project will assess whether recreational harvest is an adequate tool to control urban populations or whether other, more direct management actions are warranted. The Iowa DNR currently allocates 9 of the 107 days available to hunt Canada geese to 3 zones surrounding urban areas during a Special September Canada Goose season. This season is intended to target nuisance geese in urban areas. However, the harvest and impact of this season on the population dynamics of geese in urban areas is unknown. The results of this project will allow the Iowa DNR to evaluate this season as a management tool to control Canada geese in urban areas. || Iowa's Canada goose population has gone from near zero to April population estimates that occasionally exceed 100,000.

Because the grant period only covers a portion of that timeframe, proportion of surviving mussels at release sites will serve as an interim indicator of progress toward the long-term goal. | | |[ Spawning Potential Ratio Assessment and Sensitivity Analysis Utilizing Estimates of Age at Maturity and Fecundity for Yelloweye Rockfish in Prince William Sound, || Yelloweye Rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) are a highly-valued catch in recreational and commercial fisheries throughout Alaska and make up an important portion of the subsistence harvest in communities along the Gulf of Alaska. However, no management or assessment strategies exist for Yelloweye Rockfish in Prince William Sound, and to date no abundance estimates have been made.

The Chena River juvenile Chinook Salmon study will provide a method to estimate the outmigration timing and magnitude of smolt production from several rearing areas on a highly utilized stock. These estimates will lead to a mark-recapture study design that generates accurate and precise estimates of smolt abundance and marine survival that can improve the stock assessment models that are used to establish sustainable escapement goals. This study is a collaboration between the University of Alaska Fairbanks and Alaska Department of Fish and Game. This sampling design will generate accurate and precise estimates of timing into and out of the rearing areas as well as relative overwinter survival. These improved models will aid managers when making decisions about the Yukon River's important subsistence, commercial, and sport fisheries. The project will also identify and characterize important fall rearing areas for juvenile Chinook Salmon. All components of this study are identified by the Yukon River Panel as information needs/actions.

Environmental changes that compromise the ability of these streams to support salmon could have dramatic consequences for the region. In particular, there is concern that climate change could undermine the capacity of SEAK streams to support productive fisheries via alterations to water temperature and flow regimes via impacts on multiple freshwater life stages. Although life-cycle models that track salmon growth and survival across life stages have been developed for many at-risk populations throughout the southern range of salmon there have been limited efforts to expand this approach northward to Alaska. This project is a collaboration among the University of Alaska Fairbanks, U.S. Forest Service, and the Southeast Alaska Watershed Coalition. Results of our life cycle modeling for pink, chum, and coho salmon will increase the shared body of knowledge of Alaska watershed ecosystems and enhance community resilience. By presenting user-friendly versions of life-cycle models and model results to southeast Alaska community members and project partners, the project will enhance communities' capacity to prepare for and adapt to environmental change by: 1) sharing knowledge of which systems are likely at-risk to help communities decide whether and how to mitigate and/or adapt to changes to local salmon resources; 2) training communities to use and adapt the life cycle models themselves, while continuing to serve as a resource for communities using the models; and 3) supporting community adaptation planning efforts via a climate scenarios planning session. || Salmon that spawn and rear in southeast Alaska (SEAK) forest streams are critically important to the region's economic vitality and cultural identity.

However, fire frequency, size and severity are increasing in Alaska owing to climate warming. Interactions among fire, climate, permafrost, vegetation and hydrologic and watershed processes are poorly understood, yet critical for conservation and management of boreal aquatic habitats in a changing environment. Our research will address this challenge on and around DoD lands in interior Alaska by combining a detailed field experiment and measurements with an integrated suite of spatially- and temporally-explicit climate, terrestrial, and aquatic habitat models to better our understanding of the effects of fire and climate change on aquatic communities in interior Alaska boreal ecosystems. Collaborators include the University of Alaska Fairbanks, USGS, Alaska Department of Fish and Game, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Department of Defense, and the Alaska Fire Science Consortium.

This tool has been used in several fish habitat studies, stream surveys, and sampling protocols when assessing coverage of riparian vegetation over streams. Although densiometers are very effective they cannot visually document an ever-changing canopy. Hemispherical photography is another tool that has been developed to evaluate the forest canopy. Photographs are taken in an upward direction using a wide-angle lens and post processed with image-analyzing software. However, hemispherical photography systems are typically expensive (~$2,000-$8,000), time consuming, and highly susceptible to damage when used in aquatic environments. The purpose of this study was to develop an inexpensive, fast, and rugged hemispherical photography system that can be used in aquatic ecosystems without fear of damage of equipment. We obtained paired densiometer readings and hemispherical photographs using GoPro Hero 4 action camera at sites in the Verde River in central Arizona. We post-processed the photos using two different image editing software programs. The inexpensive hemispherical photography method we developed provided cover measurements which were correlated (r = 0.8546, P < 0.05) with densitometer measurements, but could also provide a visual record of the overstory (different plant species, and amounts). Hemispherical photography, with further development, will be a useful addition or alternative to densitometer measurements for measuring stream canopy.

Spawning habitat for the population was restricted to the tidal estuary. Dam removals (Veazie and Great Works; rkm 60), and upstream fish passage modifications at other dams, are anticipated to reconnect American shad to most of their historic freshwater habitat upstream of Milford Dam (rkm 62). To assess how this change in access may influence estuarine use, we sampled both adult and juvenile shad. Adults were sampled in 2013-7 (cohorts restricted to the estuary; n= 540). Juveniles (n=220) were collected from the estuary (April to September), from 2011-4 (restricted to the estuary) and 2015-7 (connected to freshwater habitat). Otoliths were taken from all fish for age analysis; scales from adults were taken to assess spawning history. Adults were dominated by older age classes (4-8 yr) with a high incidence of repeat spawning. Otolith microchemistry (Sr and Ba) suggests that many juveniles were reared in elevated salinities, often moving into freshwater prior to fall migration. The general pattern of salinity use by juveniles has remained qualitatively unchanged post dam removal, likely reflective of low upstream recruitment. || Spawning habitat for American shad in the Penobscot River was restricted to the tidal estuary prior to two dam removal.

Extensive restoration efforts have included recent dam removals in the Kennebec and Penobscot Rivers. The current adult passage performance criteria at Milford Dam (Penobscot) includes 95% passage within 48 hours of approach. This threshold has not been met and adults have been delayed for weeks. In the Kennebec system, passage solutions and criteria will be negotiated in the near future for four dams. It is likely that the rationale for the 48h passage criteria will be reassessed, and challenged if proposed. The current state of knowledge with respect to metabolic costs and fitness outcomes for delayed Atlantic salmon is not robust and there currently exists no clear quantification of risk associated with delay. We propose to characterize specific energetic costs of delays to upstream migrating adult salmon using bioenergetics modeling. This work will be informed by i) field assessments of water temperatures, ii) energetic assessment of adults, and iii) the thermal experience of adults. In the end we hope to compare the range of thermal experiences of these fish during their spawning migration, and quantify the theoretical risks of delays at dams that subject these fish to warmer temperatures. This work is central to ensuring effective passage to and from spawning habitat, a key objective for recovery of this federally endangered species. It is particularly relevant as the Gulf of Maine DPS of Atlantic salmon is currently NOAA's Species in the Spotlight and the State of Maine Strategic Plan for the Restoration of Diadromous Fishes to the Penobscot River lists \"improving fish passage\" as a central objective for recovery. || Atlantic salmon runs in the Penobscot and Kennebec Rivers of Maine are federally endangered and remain low. Inefficient fishways at dams continue to slow and prevent upstream migrations to spawning habitat; delays of weeks to months are common. These delays expose fish to elevated water temperatures, resulting in increased metabolic demand. These energetic costs have not been quantified, nor have fitness outcomes been characterized, but energy loss may influence gonadal development, spawning performance and probability of surviving to spawn again. We are working with NOAA nad Maine Department of Marine Resources to better understand this risk. We propose to characterize specific energetic costs of delays to upstream migrating adult salmon using bioenergetics modeling. This work will be informed by i) field assessments of water temperatures, ii) energetic assessment of adults, and iii) the thermal experience of adults.

Conceptual \"blueprints\" for basin-scale hydropower development have been introduced (e.g., NOAA's Basin-Scale Opportunity Assessment Initiative), and existing regulatory tools (e.g., compensatory mitigation under the Clean Water Act) and planning programs (e.g., Partners for Fish and Wildlife) can potentially be targeted to inform decision-making. To date, these decision frameworks and \"hooks\" have proven more difficult to implement in practice. Instead agency actions tend to be case-specific and reactive in response to individual projects and events rather than proactive, considering alternative actions and consequences before issues reach a boiling point. Research and engagement targeted at understanding agency actions and perspectives including knowledge gaps and challenges faced in the relicensing process is urgently needed to inform more proactive basin-scale decision-making at this critical juncture in dam decision-making. || Over 52 dams in Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island will require FERC relicensing in the next decade, many are approaching their design life, and preferences for dams and ecosystem services are changing. Research and engagement targeted at understanding agency actions and perspectives including knowledge gaps and challenges faced in the relicensing process is urgently needed to inform more proactive basin-scale decision-making at this critical juncture in dam decision-making. | | |[ Optimizing strategies to hydraulically plant Atlantic salmon eggs based on fry dispersal patterns ](/coopunits/project/169900791808/jzydlewski) | December 2021 || The Gulf of Maine Distinct Population Segment of Atlantic salmon has suffered from habitat loss and exploitation over the last century. Hatchery supplementation has unquestionably prevented the extirpation of the species over the last decades. Stocking older life history stages minimizes early life history mortality, but does so at a cost of limiting exposure to a natural freshwater environment. Egg planting is a process by which fertilized eggs from the hatchery are injected into the gravel in the fall replicates the natural spawning process in streams and provides a natural experience which can be important for adaptation. This methodology has been used experimentally within the region, but significant uncertainties exist in developing the effective implementation of this method at a greater scale. Specifically, the habitat dependent distribution of juveniles after emergence from the gravel would provide information necessary to apply the technique to meet conservation hatchery goals with respect to fall parr densities. We propose to characterize the dispersal pattern of egg planted Atlantic salmon as a function of habitat and use these data to construct a GIS based tool to inform stocking. This work, if successful, can help to optimize the application of egg planting at a management level. || Hatchery supplementation has unquestionably prevented the extirpation of Atlantic salmon over the last decades.

In general, capture-recapture methods provide population-level demographic parameters, while telemetry methods provide individual level information on habitat use, movement, and behavior. Although the two approaches share information on population dynamics, the resulting data are generally analyzed separately, which can lead to inefficient estimators and substantial bias. We propose development of a framework for integrating spatial capture-recapture (SCR) and telemetry data to simultaneously estimate density, habitat use, and movement of marine mammals. Integrated SCR telemetry models have the potential to (1) address shortcomings of traditional capture-recapture methods; (2) allow estimation of abundance, density, movement, dispersal, and habitat selection using all available data; and (3) be applied across a variety of study designs used for marine mammal monitoring. We propose to develop SCR-telemetry models using capture-recapture and telemetry data for polar bears in the Chukchi Sea during the period 2008 - 2016. We also propose to use simulation methods to evaluate the performance of SCR-telemetry models and provide monitoring design recommendations of broad applicability to polar bears and other marine mammals. Improved monitoring methods are critical to obtaining accurate information on polar bear abundance and distribution, which is needed for management and conservation under national laws and international agreements, and SCR-telemetry methods show great promise for providing that information. More broadly, SCR-telemetry models provide researchers and managers with a framework to integrate multiple data types - including data from<br>emerging technologies (e.g., satellite tags, acoustic sampling, autonomous drones) - to improve the accuracy and efficiency of marine mammal monitoring programs across the Arctic. || There is an increasing need to identify population- and individual-level responses to rapid physical and biological changes in Arctic marine ecosystems. For Arctic marine mammals that range over large areas, reliable and efficient methods to estimate movement and demographic parameters are vital to evaluating ecosystem-level changes, population status, and subsistence harvest, and minimizing conflicts with humans and resource development. Advanced statistical models that accommodate the particular challenges of studying wide-ranging marine mammals are needed. This project is a collaboration between researchers at the Washington Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, the US Geological Survey Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory. The goal of the work is to provide recommendations to management agencies such as the US Fish and Wildlife Service regarding data collection and analysis methods to improve knowledge of marine mammal, particularly polar bear, demography. | | |[ Structured Decision Support for Bald Eagle Monitoring in Alaska ](/coopunits/project/169825855488/Rebecca.Kolstrom) | May 2019 || The project used expert opinion regarding core values, objectives, and priorities from NPS biologists and natural resource chief using email surveys designed to foster consensus via a Delphi Process. Through this process, we will obtain ranked objectives for bald eagle monitoring, and several scenarios by which to achieve them. The scenarios were evaluated and ranked upon their ability to 1) achieve the monitoring objectives, and 2) cost of implementation. We then used an optimizing routine that incorporates scenario rankings and cost to arrive at a solution for monitoring that achieves our most important objectives at the lowest cost. || Bald eagles are currently monitored by the Southwest Alaska Inventory and Monitoring Network as part of their Vital Signs Monitoring Plan. Bald eagles were selected to represent terrestrial animals as a signal of biological integrity, because of their role as a keystone predator in the system, on various avian and fish populations. However, the different parks with the system use different methods to monitor nests, making it more difficult for park managers to use overall bald eagle population trends as indicators of environmental quality. Because of these discrepancies, the monitoring program has been disconnected from management goals. This project was designed to provide the National Park Service with a standardized set of objectives and monitoring protocol for bald eagle monitoring that optimizes information content and minimizes cost. | | |[ Evaluating the status and distributions of bats in WNS-free areas using standardized acoustic monitoring data from the North American Bat Monitoring Program (RWO118) ](/coopunits/project/169825761280/William.Kendall) | August 2023 || White-nose syndrome has decimated hibernating bat populations across North America since it emerged 10 years ago in New York.

The behavior and physiology of young mallards during this time may be unique as they learn to fly and navigate, exploit new forage and wetland types, develop settling and social cues, molt, avoid predators, changes social status and bonds, and anticipate migration. Indeed, these life-history events differ considerably from those of adult mallards, suggesting there may be important differences in movement patterns and habitat requirements between adults and juveniles. Past waterfowl studies of movement ecology faced technical limitations due to transmitter size, strength and range of tracking equipment, and cost. However, the advent of new satellite technology, reduced transmitter size and cost, and increased battery life now allows investigation of avian movements over larger spatial and temporal extents. Survival of juvenile mallards during the autumn is also an integral component of recruitment to the breeding population, and the ability to these new technologies, specific to hatch year mallards during this sensitive time,, will provide critical information to inform management decisions in North and South Dakota. || Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) are one of the most heavily-studied waterfowl species, yet sparse research investigated their ecology during the post-fledging period, prior to fall migration.

With continued grassland loss associated with conversion to row crop agriculture, and changing predator communities (e.g., declines in red fox, active coyote control), understanding how habitat dynamics influence predator-prey interactions and nest success of ground-nesting birds will improve development of comprehensive management recommendations for remaining grasslands, restoration or reclamation efforts, and for active management programs that wish to modify grassland regimes or predator communities themselves to improve nesting habitat and nest survival. || Predator-prey interactions influence vital rates and predation is a major cause of nest failure of ground-nesting birds (i.e., ring-necked pheasants, waterfowl). Predator movements are influenced by patch dynamics and spatial configuration of patches on the landscape; understanding the ecology of predation and predator movements is critical to explain predator-prey interactions, habitat use (spatial and temporal), and foraging of nest predators. Movements also are influenced by vegetation composition and structural heterogeneity of vegetation and abiotic habitat components. Grassland patch dynamics can influence nest success of ground-nesting birds. Larger blocks of grassland have been associated with increased nest success of waterfowl, whereas multiple patches of intermediate-sized grassland within agricultural landscapes were associated with low nest success, most likely from predation. Finally, variation in the composition of the predator community can influence nest survival and influence nest-site selection. Identifying habitat characteristics associated with high reproduction and survival of grassland-nesting birds is an important research priority, particularly with respect to the \"predator context\". This research is being conducted through South Dakota State University and is supported by a grant from the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act Fund (Pittman-Robertson) administered through the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish & Parks.

Once abundant throughout the Devils Garden Plateau of southern Oregon and northern California, sage-grouse have declined significantly and there is a strong correlation between decreased sage-grouse abundance and the loss or fragmentation of sagebrush in the region due to juniper encroachment. Landscape-scale modeling has shown that juniper encroachment negatively impacts sage-grouse, and recent research has positively linked sage-grouse demographics to juniper removal activities. In 2005, the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge Complex (KBNWRC) in collaboration with ranchers, California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), Bureau of Lan Management (BLM), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and United States Forest Service (USFS) initiated a sagebrush restoration effort and grouse translocation program to augment sage-grouse numbers, and prevent extirpation of the Devils Garden population on the Clear Lake NWR. Anecdotal accounts suggest birds are seasonally moving throughout restored areas; however, these earlier monitoring efforts were conducted opportunistically and without targeted objectives, resulting in limited quantitative data. In collaboration with USFWS and OSU, this current project will attempt to fill knowledge gaps regarding dispersal ecology, seasonal movement patterns and demographics relative to landscape distribution of seasonal habitat, and habitat condition (structure, hydrology) for sage-grouse in this area. Strategic and successful habitat restoration in Devils Garden is contingent on collecting this information to address management objectives for meeting seasonal habitat requirements of grouse while promoting landscape connectivity and broader ecosystem benefits including hydrologic efficiencies and habitat resiliency. || Range-wide declines in greater sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) have been attributed to habitat alteration and fragmentation.

Providing fish passage has potential to remedy these impacts, but few studies have directly quantified the effectiveness of fish passage for restoring genetic connectivity and increasing genetic diversity. The FishPass project on the Boardman River represents a unique opportunity to investigate this topic. Fish populations above the Union Street Dam have been isolated from Traverse Bay since the dam's construction in 1867. The FishPass project will restore connectivity between the Boardman River and Traverse Bay, allowing species such as walleye, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, white sucker, and rock bass to access the upper reaches of the river. Collecting baseline genetic data from these species as well as eDNA water samples from sites above and below the dam will allow us to determine the genetic impact of fish passage on fish populations above the dam and investigate distribution patterns of species that are being passed. We hypothesize that decreases in genetic differentiation between populations above and below the dam and increases in genetic diversity of above dam populations will be detectable 5-10 years after fish passage has been initiated. However, it is likely that these effects will vary substantially by species due to differences in life history. We also hypothesize that eDNA will represent a useful tool for monitoring species diversity and distribution patterns. || Fish populations above the Union Street Dam on the Boardman River have been isolated from Traverse Bay since the dam's construction in 1867, but fish passage will soon be implemented on the river.

Cisco restoration will likely represent a multidecadal effort with many successes and setbacks, similar to restoration of lake trout in the Great Lakes. It is vitally important to guide this restoration effort using the best data available to increase the probability of success while preventing irreparable damage to the genetic integrity of extant populations. The genetic management plan that we are proposing to create will provide an important guide for management agencies and will help to ensure that the adaptive diversity found within the vast array of cisco species and forms is maintained. || Cisco are an important forage fish species in the Great Lakes that have experienced significant population declines due to various factors such as changes in lake productivity and introductions of invasive species. Recently, resource management agencies have prioritized cisco restoration and are anxious to take action. Cisco species vary in a number of morphological characteristics, but it is unclear whether this variation corresponds to heritable genetic differences. Understanding the landscape of adaptive variation in cisco will help to inform future management and restoration efforts. This project is a collaboration between the Wisconsin Cooperative Fishery Research Unit, USGS Great Lakes Science Center, Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Little Traverse Band of Odawa Indians, and Laval University.

Starting in the late 1800's, the barred owl began expanding its geographic range north and west, and their newly expanded range now completely overlaps that of the federally threatened northern spotted owl. Strong evidence indicates that competition with invading barred owls is causing rapid declines in populations of spotted owls, and that in some portions of the Pacific Northwest, barred owls now occur at much greater densities relative to spotted owls. However, little research exists on the overall impacts of this newly established apex predator on other forest species (besides spotted owls) and food-web dynamics. In collaboration with USGS-FRESC and USFWS, this project will take advantage of the experimental design associated with an on-going barred owl removal experiment to evaluate the impact this novel avian predator is having on the food web in the PNW. Understanding the impact of barred owls on the food web is critical for spotted owls and other native species, particularly as barred owl densities reach carrying capacity in the PNW. || The barred owl (Strix varia) is a medium-sized forest owl native to eastern North America (Mazur and James 2000).

Historically, the South Platte River Basin naturally experienced a wide range of seasonal temperatures However, urbanization and development of Waste Water Treatment Plants have contributed to warmer and more consistent water temperatures throughout the year, particularly in winter months. Less variation in seasonal temperatures could have adverse effects on native fishes that previously relied on temperature fluctuations for important biological processes, such as reproduction. Assessing the thermal requirements of warm water fishes will provide valuable information towards establishing protective winter water temperature standards in effluent-dominated streams. || Historically, the South Platte River Basin naturally experienced a wide range of seasonal temperatures However, urbanization and development of Waste Water Treatment Plants have contributed to warmer and more consistent water temperatures throughout the year, particularly in winter months.

Available information indicates populations are declining and geographic distribution is mostly confined to isolated localities in the Cordillera Central. On 20 September 2017, Hurricane Maria moved across the island of Puerto Rico from southeast to northwest with sustained winds of 250 km/hr. Initial reports from the center of the geographic region occupied by SSHA indicate massive and extensive damage to forest cover, including defoliation and loss of canopy. Recently completed research on the SSHA supported by the USFWS State of the Birds program has generated information on pre-hurricane geographic distribution and nesting territory occupancy. Funding provided by the Quick Response Program would allow updating the status of the species following Hurricane Maria, identify key habitat locations for SSHA and assess impacts from this severe storm. || The Puerto Rican Sharp-shinned Hawk is an endangered woodland raptor of Puerto Rico. Available information on the SSHA indicates populations are small and mostly known from montane forest reserves on the island. Updated information is lacking on SSHA population status and use of private lands, particularly the coffee growing regions of the Cordillera Central. Hurricanes constitute a major disturbance to terrestrial ecosystems in the Caribbean islands and their effects play a major role in forest succession. Further, forest-specialist birds may shift habitat use patterns after hurricanes. Hurricane Maria moved east to west across the Cordillera Central causing damage and alteration of forest structure, including loss of tree branches (e.g., nesting structures) and the opening of the forest canopy with a consequent increase in understory and midstory cover. Consequently, post-hurricane forest conditions may have reduced their value as suitable habitat for the SSHA. Following hurricane Maria we invested approximately 179 person-hours monitoring SSHA presence at 23 known locations in private and public lands of the Cordillera Central. Private lands included sites in the vicinity of the Maricao, Guilarte and Toro Negro forest reserves as well as locations inside both forest reserves. Surveys after the hurricane yielded a total of SSHA occupying 9 territories. These included 9 SSHA breeding pairs and a single individual. These included 5 territorial SSHA pairs in private lands and 4 SSHA pairs plus a single individual inside the forest reserves. Damage to SSHA habitat from hurricane Maria was extensive, with approximately 90% of canopy loss. There were extensive areas of near total defoliation and trees suffered major breakage and uprooting. Importantly, most trees used for nesting by SSHA pairs were toppled over by the hurricane. Of 21 nest trees used by SSHA during 2014-2016, only 9 were still standing. Hurricane Maria greatly modified the vegetation structure of the Maricao, Guilarte and Toro Negro Forests, and likely affected many basic ecological processes. Microclimate, rainfall patterns, nutrient cycling, and litter fall are among some of the aspects of terrestrial ecosystems disrupted by intense hurricanes. Given the precarious situation of the endangered island raptor, additional research is urgently needed on SSHA survival and movements following hurricane Maria to avoid the extinction of this critically endangered species. | | |[ A GIS-based rapid assessment of geographic distribution and habitat conditions of the endangered Puerto Rico Plain Pigeon Patagioneas inornata wetmorei after Hurricane Maria ](/coopunits/project/169599744000/fvilella) | December 2018 || The Plain Pigeon (hereafter, PLPI) is a large arboreal columbid of open woodlands of the Greater Antilles. It was listed as endangered in 1970 and is believed to have experienced population increases and range expansion from protection from harvest and natural regeneration of forest habitats. Hurricane Maria moved across the island of Puerto Rico from southeast to northwest with sustained winds of 250 km/hr. The eyewall of this large and destructive hurricane moved across was is considered to be the center of the region occupied by PLPI. For this research we used a remote sensing and GIS based approach to delineate PLPI habitat types across municipalities of east-central Puerto Rico before and after Hurricane Maria. || The Plain Pigeon (hereafter, PLPI) is a large arboreal columbid of open woodlands of the Greater Antilles. The PLPI subspecies of plain pigeon in Puerto Rico (P. inornata wetmorei) is considered rare and is listed as endangered. Hurricane Maria moved across the island of Puerto Rico from southeast to northwest with sustained winds of 250 km/hr. The eyewall of this large and destructive hurricane moved across the center of the region occupied by PLPI including the municipalities of Cidra, Aguas Buenas, Comerio and Naranjito. We utilized a spatial modeling aproach to assess hurricane impacts to PLPI habitat and quantify damage to forest cover, including defoliation and loss of canopy. Plain Pigeon numbers were negatively impacted by hurricane Maria. Data on PLPI presence along DNER survey routes before the hurricane averaged 50 or more individuals. Number of PLPI by station averaged approximately 3 individuals per survey ranging from 1-17. Surveys conducted for this rapid assessment by project personnel and cooperators suggests PLPI detections were reduced by more than half after the storm. Damage to PLPI habitat in the municipalities encompassing our study area was widespread, with varying intensity depending on particular sectors in each municipality. Additional research is needed on post-hurricane geographic distribution, movement and dispersal to fully assess the impacts of hurricane Maria to the recovery of the Plain Pigeon. | | |[ The Maine Geospatial Institute--A statewide collaboration for workforce development, education, and research to facilitate economic growth ](/coopunits/project/169582190592/cynthia.loftin) | December 2021 || The Maine Geospatial Institute is a statewide collaborative of the seven University of Maine System (UMS) campuses developed to support economic growth, workforce development, education and research in geospatial technologies used in transportation, municipal and county government, environmental services, resource management, and utilities.

This is especially problematic for the Neosho subspecies of SMB given the distribution covers an interwoven landscape of rivers and reservoirs. Our research focuses on the movement and habitat use of the Neosho SMB with an emphasis on the reproductive and juvenile development periods. We are using radio telemetry to quantify movements and habitat use of adult and juvenile SMB in streams that vary in size, hydrology, and proximity to impoundments in the Ozark Highlands. We are conducting snorkel surveys on a diverse subset of stream reaches throughout the range of the Neosho SMB to understand the multi-scale habitat features and environmental conditions that influence SMB nest and age-0 SMB densities in Ozark streams. Lastly, we are quantifying days since hatch of young-of-year SMB via otoliths to determine the environmental relationships among hydrologic factors, hatch date, and daily growth. This project is funded by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation. Project results will identify areas across the landscape that contribute substantially to reproduction and recruitment.

The Least Darter is a species of conservation concern that has two isolated populations occupying portions of the Arbuckle Mountain and Ozark Highlands ecoregions. Our study objective is to determine what environmental factors are related to Least Darter occupancy, while accounting for detection. Our general approach is to assess different environmental factors at multiple spatial scales to determine the relationships among microhabitats, reaches, and stream segments and occurrence of Least Darter and sympatric species. The major benefits will be identification of likely populations that can be used as the foundation for a targeted monitoring program, and 2) it will help identify stream segments that likely contain spring locations.

Prescriptions of land management for pollinators is complicated by the diversity of Agency management objectives, the biology of focal pollinator species and communities, the composition and structure of specific habitats available for management, and the varied effects of landscape context on outcomes of habitat manipulation. Location of land managed for pollinator conservation can affect pollinator community composition, and both habitat composition and pattern surrounding the focal area can affect pollinator use of the managed landscape. Road and powerline rights-of-way (ROW) are managed lands that comprise a relatively small portion of the northeastern landscape overall, however, they potentially have a disproportionate effect on pollinator communities as they may simultaneously fragment, connect, create, enhance, or compromise pollinator habitat. Whether ROWs serve as pollinator population sources or sinks likely is confounded by landscape context. Although knowledge of the role of roadside and powerline ROWs in pollinator conservation is rapidly growing, most research has been more focused on understanding effects of habitat type and less focused on landscape context and pattern effects on pollinator abundance and diversity. Additionally, the increasingly abundant literature examining relationships between pollinator occurrence, abundance, and diversity in managed and non-managed landscapes provides diverse information to help guide habitat management for pollinators. This project is a collaboration of the Maine Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, the University of Maine, the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, and the Maine Department of Transportation. Our systematic review, conducted as a meta-analysis, of patterns and variability reported in the published science on pollinators and land management, with a focus on roadsides and ROWs, will inform pollinator conservation in the northeastern U.S. broadly, and provide a comprehensive baseline for guiding currentROW management recommendations and hypotheses for future research. || Recent declines in managed, non-native bees have heightened general awareness of the importance of the pollination services of native bees, butterflies, and other insects.

We assisted the GADNR by developing a model to estimate population parameters, using combined data from fyke netting and PIT antenna arrays. || Sicklefin Redhorse (<i>Moxostoma</i> sp.) is a native freshwater fish (undescribed species), whose range includes the Hiwassee River Basin in NC and GA, and the Little Tennessee River Basin in NC. The fish is rare within its range and is facing potential threats such as habitat degradation and migratory barriers. Little is currently known about the status and population dynamics of Sicklefin Redhorse, which could impede effective management. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources is engaged in collaborative efforts to monitor Sicklefin Redhorse in north Georgia. In addition, the Sicklefin Redhorse Conservation Committee (which is a partnership that consists of state agencies, federal agencies, NGOs, and power companies) is devoted to conservation and management of the species. The Georgia Cooperative Research Unit recently collaborated with the Sicklefin Redhorse Conservation Committee and researchers from University of Georgia to develop a population model estimating important parameters to evaluate the status of the Sicklefin Redhorse population in Brasstown Creek, GA using capture-mark-recapture data. The model provided information such as survival probability, recruitment, and spawning population abundance. A future project is anticipated so that more recent data can be included in an updated model to refine estimates of important population parameters, which may influence future monitoring or management decisions. | | |[ Assess the recovery of westslope cutthroat trout and Arctic ... ](/coopunits/project/169503774720/andriana.puchany) | June 2021 || Native populations of Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WCT) and Arctic Grayling in Yellowstone National Park were reduced or eliminated through competition, predation, and hybridization with nonnative fishes that were historically stocked by managers, ostensibly to enhance sportfishing. National Park Service fisheries managers carried out conservation actions aimed at restoring WCT and Arctic Grayling populations in two watersheds in Yellowstone National Park, including East Fork Specimen Creek in the Gallatin River drainage and Grayling Creek in the Madison River drainage. Conservation actions included 1) building barriers impassable to upstream fish movement to isolate watersheds; 2) applying rotenone, a lethal fish toxicant, to eliminate all fish from the watersheds above the barriers; and 3) reintroducing native fish to the isolated watersheds. NPS fisheries managers plan to continue restoration efforts of WCT and Arctic Grayling in additional park watersheds, but first want to understand how past conservation efforts performed to guide future restoration actions. Moreover, similar management actions are being conducted or contemplated worldwide. Therefore, the goal of this research project is to assess the recovery and status of the reintroduced populations of WCT and Arctic Grayling in East Fork Specimen and Grayling creeks. Our specific objectives are to 1) assess population abundance, size structure, condition, individual growth, and reproductive success of WCT and Arctic Grayling; 2) determine the spatial distributions of restored WCT and Arctic Grayling in relation to the reintroduction sites; 3) determine how population size structure and condition of recovering WCT in East Fork Specimen Creek compare to those of the hybridized WCT population they replaced; and 4) estimate the genetic population structure of recovering WCT relative to the contributions of the various WCT donor sources (Last Chance, Geode, and Muskrat creeks, and Sun Ranch Hatchery). Attainment of these objectives will provide fisheries managers with information needed to better manage such populations and to guide future restoration efforts elsewhere. || Native populations of Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WCT)and Arctic Grayling in Yellowstone National Park were reduced or eliminated through competition, predation, and hybridization with nonnative fishes that were historically stocked by managers, ostensibly to enhance sportfishing.

Peck Reservoir with a focus on population abundance and survival ](/coopunits/project/169502334976/hcg0509) | June 2019 || The paddlefish (Polyodon spathula) fisheries in Montana are important recreational fisheries that are highly valued by Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks and anglers within and outside Montana. Given the life-history characteristics of paddlefish such as long-lived and late maturing, managing the species for sustainable harvest requires precise and accurate information about their population dynamics because they are particularly susceptible to overharvest (Boreman 1997). Population vital-rate data are essential to developing harvest models and in turn those models are used by fisheries biologists to establish harvest regulations that ensure sustainable harvest. Without the understanding from model outputs, fisheries biologists could be allowing the population to be over-harvested or under-harvested (i.e., denying angling opportunities). Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks has been sampling the paddlefish population above Ft. Peck Reservoir since the early 1970s (Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks 2017). In 1993, Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks established a standardized monitoring program to evaluate population size, harvest rates, spawning periodicity, movement, and spawning locations (Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks 2017). These data have been used to better understand the paddlefish population, but fisheries biologists have recently deliberated additional methods (particularly quantitative analysis methods) that could better inform the decision-making process for establishing harvest regulations. Currently, the focus is on providing more robust estimates of abundance using capture-history information. These data could also be used to estimate survival rates that would inform a suite of population models, which could then be used in harvest models to assist in supporting management decisions. The goal of this project is to determine if the current paddlefish database contains the appropriate data structure to estimate abundance and survival using more robust methods that incorporate capture-history information. In addition, we will determine if the current data structure provides key vital rates to develop common fisheries harvest models. || The paddlefish (Polyodon spathula) fisheries in Montana are important recreational fisheries that are highly valued by Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks and anglers within and outside Montana.

This understanding is limited to inferences based on the literature (i.e., what has been documented in other systems), preliminary information from direct tributaries to Lake Pend Oreille, and the timing of fish captured in traps in the Montana adfluvial streams. The literature suggests that juvenile Bull Trout emigration timing can be variable, potentially system specific, and potentially influenced by numerous factors. Of particular interest, numerous adfluvial Bull Trout populations exhibit a large spring emigration associated with the freshet and peak flows. The closest and most well-documented evidence for this comes from Trestle Creek which is a direct tributary to Lake Pend Oreille. Downs et al. (2006) documented substantial spring emigration events in Trestle Creek that have never been observed in the Montana adfluvial streams; albeit, the spring events were predominated by age-0 emigrants which purportedly have survival rates approaching zero. Further information is currently being collected in both Trestle Creek and another direct tributary to Lake Pend Oreille, Granite Creek, using passive integrated transponder (PIT) tagged fish and PIT arrays. Preliminary evidence from these two streams suggests there are not meaningful spring emigration events and that nearly all juvenile fish emigrate during the fall and winter (Ken Bouwens, Idaho Fish and Game, personal communication). Understanding whether or not there is a spring emigration has numerous management implications. First, if it is learned that there is a meaningful spring emigration, efforts could be directed toward learning and increasing capture efficiency during this time of year. Conversely, if there is not a meaningful spring emigration from the Montana adfluvial streams, trap and transport operations could be discontinued during all times of the year except the fall. Under this scenario, the time and money saved would be available to do more prudent activities in the interest of increasing connectivity and otherwise enhancing the adfluvial Bull Trout populations. Developing this understanding will also give managers the information they need to develop design criteria for future traps (e.g., do traps need to be capable of effectively fishing through the spring freshet, or only through flashy fall rain events). This has implications in terms of both cost, and the footprint of future traps. Thus, the objectives of this study are to evaluate capture efficiency of tributary traps in Graves Creek and East Fork Bull River. || Currently, we have a limited and potentially biased understanding of when juvenile Bull Trout emigrate from the Montana adfluvial streams.

Spawning lake trout congregate on rocky shoals broadcasting gametes over angular clean cobble substrate (Binder et al. 2014), and demonstrate spawning site fidelity (Esteve et al. 2008). Lake trout embryos are non-motile and have undeveloped physiological systems with a limited ability to acclimate to environmental perturbations (P\u00f6rtner and Farrell 2008; Helvik et al. 2009). Increasing mortality beyond gillnetting and in lieu of gillnetting (the most preferred option) is probably feasible because of the vulnerability of lake trout embryos. For example, the placement of lake trout carcasses on spawning areas after lake trout have spawned resulted in > 95% mortality, when carcasses remained on the site (Thomas 2017). Currently, scientists with the National Park Service and the US Geological Survey, Montana Cooperative Fishery Research Unit are evaluating the efficacy of carcass analogs (pellets made from rainbow trout carcasses and pellets made from plant material) and the results are promising. Much of the consternation in continuing the lake trout suppression effort in Swan Lake is related to cost and associated bycatch of bull trout in a gillnetting approach. Use of novel approaches such as those being evaluated in Yellowstone Lake may provide a tool for use in Swan Lake. However, for these methods to be effective, the exact locations of lake trout spawning sites need to be determined. There is some uncertainty in the spawning locations given that Steed et al. (see Rosenthal et al. 2016) found different 'primary' spawning locations than those defined by Cox (2010). The differences observed may be related to the gillnetting program disrupting lake trout spawning behavior. Thus, the goal of this project is to describe lake trout spawning locations and habitat associated with those areas when gillnetting suppression is not operational. The results from this project will provide locations for embryo suppression if that is deemed feasible in Swan Lake. || Novel experimental approaches to suppressing lake trout have focused on the early-life stages because lake trout spawning behavior and the physiology of lake trout embryos provide an opportunity for embryo suppression with limited bycatch.

Marsh management practices, such as drawdowns and fire, can accelerate decomposition of organic soils and lead to elevation loss. In this study, we will determine long-term accretion rates in managed and unmanaged coastal marshes in southwestern Louisiana. Companion and future studies will quantify the specific effects of selected marsh management practices on accretion and decomposition rates. Our goal is to identify long-term marsh management approaches that allow or accelerate marsh vertical accretion while also providing desired wildlife benefits. || Management of coastal marshes for wetland wildlife is a common practice along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts. Marsh management practices, such as drawdowns and fire, can, however, accelerate decomposition rates of organic soils and lead to loss of elevation and marsh conversion to open water.

To date, nearly 60 dams have been removed in the state, yet only a fraction of these streams have been monitored to assess water quality, habitat, and biotic responses to dam removal. Information on the benefits of dam removal, including the watershed and long-term impacts of these changes, are critical for the public to understand expectations following dam removal and to gain support for future dam removals. We also need a better understanding of ecological changes following dam removal in order to better answer questions from local, regional, and national regulatory community that impact our ability to advance projects. Over the last three years, extensive pre-removal data has been collected on temperature, dissolved oxygen, and macroinvertebrates at 12 dam removal sites across Massachusetts through a partnership with researchers at the University of Massachusetts (UMass) and the Massachusetts Division of Ecological Restoration (MDER). These data showed that most sites had significant warming downstream of dams, highlighting the potential for extensive consequences of dams on biota, particularly coldwater fishes. However, the magnitude and extent of effects of dams are highly variable across sites and raise additional questions. Here, we propose to continue sampling these 12 sites plus 3 additional coldwater streams to quantify water quality, macroinvertebrate, and fish responses to dam removal. We will use the extensive fish database for Massachusetts and collaborate with UMass, MDER, and the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife (MassWildlife) to add additional sites for a broader assessment of fish responses. The results will be used to model the collective ecological benefits of dam removal statewide and will be synthesized into outreach materials highlighting these benefits to promote future dam removal toward increasing the quality and resilience of stream ecosystems. || There are thousands of small dams in Massachusetts that fragment and impair nearly every stream and river throughout the state, altering fish passage, flow, sediment, and nutrient movement, and making these ecosystems less resilient to natural and anthropogenic disturbances.

In addition to the agricultural losses, eroded sediments and the associated agricultural additives are one of the largest sources of nonpoint pollution in southern watersheds. Starting in 1936, Congress authorized various projects to control soil erosion; two of the longest running were conducted in Northern Mississippi: the Yazoo Little Tallahatchie Flood Prevention Project 1945-1985 and the Delta Headwaters Project, formerly known as the Demonstration of Erosion Control 1984- Present. Through the implementation of these two projects, many methods of erosion control were constructed and tested for effectiveness which led to a significant reduction in suspended sediments in area streams. This project will evaluate various methods of erosion control based on their effects on the biotic community to demonstrate any changes these structures may have provided to the native ecosystem. The impact of the proposed project is considerable because it will test if structures designed for one purpose, i.e. controlling erosion and lowering suspended sediment load, can provide environmental benefits, such as creating stable habitat for the biotic community. || Soil Erosion is a major contributor to degradation of valuable farmland in the Southeastern United States.

Furthermore, over 65% of the world population of these albatross species nest on remote low island refuges in the Pacific, and in smaller numbers in the main Hawaiian Islands. Relatively little is known about the life history, survival, and breeding frequency of Northern Hemisphere albatross species, and in how this compares between the low islands of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and the main Hawaiian Islands.

The project is a collaboration among the USGS-COCFWRU, the USFWS Region 1 Migratory Bird and Habitat and Inventory and Monitoring programs, the Marine National Monuments of the Pacific, and the USGS Bird Banding Laboratory. A model for annual survival and breeding probability for albatross will be developed for Kilauea Point NWR and Tern Island, allowing these processes to be connected with threats such as overlap with long-line fishing and other environmental factors. A vetted banding database will be provided for future analyses and recommendations for future monitoring intensity will also be provided to Refuge personnel. || conservation concern to the USFWS, and a petition to list the BFAL under the Endangered Species Act has recently been submitted to USFWS.

The majority of translocation research has focused on the success at recipient sites, while the impacts associated with the donor population have not been monitored. Ocala National Forest is home to the largest remaining population of Florida scrub-jays and is currently the donor site for translocations. As the goal of any translocation is to have a positive impact on the species population, it is imperative that the costs to the donor population are minimized to the greatest extent possible. This study intends to focus on the impacts that translocation could place on the donor population through monitoring of nesting success and productivity. During two field seasons, a subset of helpers will be removed from groups for translocation. Nests will be monitored within three categories of family groups: (1) no helpers, (2) helpers, (3) helpers removed. Data will be collected on productivity, nest success, weight of nestlings, time spent provisioning, and breeder persistence. Monitoring nests in groups with and without helpers will increase the understanding of how this cooperative breeder benefits from the presence of non-breeding individuals. If data show evidence that helpers do not increase productivity or nest success, then future translocations can focus on removing helpers as opposed to entire family groups. || Translocation has been considered as a conservation tool to increase the population numbers of Florida scrub-jays, especially in areas that have been recently restored, and where small, isolated populations reside and are unlikely to increase naturally through dispersal.

Targeted removal of the most harmful nuisance species has always been elusive. However, advancing technology shows promise in manipulating the sex of fishes using hormones to produce all-male progeny with a YY chromosome complement (i.e., supermales) that will spawn with existing nuisance fishes and over time, reduce, and even eliminate their populations. While supermales have been developed for several different species, efforts to develop supermales of some of the most damaging invasive fishes in the southwestern United States have not been established. We are examining feasibility of producing supermales (Trojan sex carriers - YY) of a common, short-lived invasive nonnative species to the southwestern United States, the Red Shiner Cyprinella lutrensis. Further, we are examining feasibility initial steps of production of supermales of a common long-lived invasive nonnative species to the southwestern United States, such as Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus or Green Sunfish Lepomis cyanellus, to be selected in collaboration with sponsors.

How anglers value the quality and experience of fishing at Illinois river and how they compare it with other tributaries of Lake Tenkiller (Baron Fork, and Caney Creek) may help in understanding and managing the expectations of anglers in these and similar-sized streams in the Ozark region of Oklahoma. Questions such as the value of river trips, total welfare loss if streams were inaccessible, and attitudes and preferences of anglers in maintaining high-quality fishing experience would provide invaluable information to fishery managers and help develop sound management strategy for ODWC.

Stocking of brook trout has been occurring in Wisconsin since the 1800s, and many brook trout stocked in Wisconsin were derived from non-local sources or domesticated hatchery strains such as those developed in Nashua, New Hampshire. Previous research in our lab has shown that many populations distributed throughout the state contain genetic signatures consistent with domestic strains, including some that had previously been identified as wild. One notable example of this was the Ash Creek population, which was thought to be wild and had been previously used as a broodstock source but was found to contain signatures of domestic populations. This example demonstrates the importance of accurately identifying wild populations that can be used as broodstock sources. Successful propagation programs should also integrate knowledge of population structure across the landscape. Specifically, different broodstock sources should be identified for each genetic management unit across Wisconsin. While significant research has been conducted to identify broodstock sources in the southwest area of the state (southern driftless), little genetic research has been conducted on populations from other areas such as the central sands, northern driftless, and north woods || Brook trout are native to Wisconsin and provide a culturally valuable resource as well as significant recreational fisheries. Many populations of brook trout have been threatened due to overfishing, stocking, and variable thermal regimes. Stocking has been used to supplement native brook trout populations, but often little consideration was given to the genetic suitability and fitness of stocked fish. A through genetic study is needed to identify populations of wild and domestic origin. This project is a collaboration between the Wisconsin Cooperative Fishery Research Unit and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources We will develop a comprehensive genetic baseline of brook trout population structure in Wisconsin. These data can be used to prioritize populations for conservation, determine which strains should be stocked where, and identify populations that are suitable broodstock sources. | | |[ Managing Coastal Wetlands for Wildlife and Sustainability in the Face of Sea Level Rise ](/coopunits/project/157280317440/abooth) | August 2021 || Coastal wetlands are a critical resource for waterfowl, other waterbirds, alligators, furbearers and a variety of other wetland-dependent wildlife. As such, hundreds of thousands of acres and millions of dollars have been invested in coastal wildlife refuges in Louisiana and Texas. In spite of their protection by public ownership, natural and anthropogenically-induced processes are threatening the long-term viability of these systems. Natural and anthropogenically-induced subsidence, reduced sediment loads, and increased eustatic sea levels have caused substantial marsh loss in Louisiana and Texas, with increased rates of sea level rise expected in the future. The ability of marshes to keep up with sea level rise is the result of decomposition and accretion processes. Common marsh management practices, such as fire, flooding, drawdown, and herbicides, affect accretion and decomposition rates but these rates are poorly understood and rarely quantified. In this study, we will evaluate accretion and decomposition processes in selected managed units at J.D. Murphree Wildlife Management Area in Texas. || Coastal marshes are critical habitat for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries species. Marsh loss, however, is common along the Gulf Coast and may increase with increased rates of sea level rise. To keep up with sea level rise, marsh accretion rates (particularly below ground organic material) must exceed decomposition rates. Common marsh management practices, such as fire, flooding, and drawdowns, influence decomposition and accretion, and has led to elevations declines of several feet in many waterfowl management units. We are working with Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to determine the effects of selected management practices on accretion and decomposition processes in waterfowl management units at J. D. Murphree Wildlife Management Area near Port Arthur, Texas. This research will be used to develop waterfowl management practices that benefit waterfowl but also allow marshes to adjust to increasing sea levels. | | |[ Landscape genetics, connectivity, and dispersal: predicting impacts of a top predator (Esox lucius) on salmonids in Southcentral Alaska ](/coopunits/project/154771771392/cjalbert) | September 2018 || The introduction and expansion of invasive Northern Pike in southcentral Alaska have driven declines of salmonids in the Matanuska-Susitna Basin (MatSu) and led to the extirpation of a rare form of three spine stickleback in Praetor Lake near Wasilla.

The Santa Ana Sucker was listed as an endangered species in 2000 and the primary threat to its continued presence is hydrological modifications that degrade and reduce available habitat (USFWS 2014). Water quality is also considered a high priority concern (priority 2). The Santa Ana River is heavily influenced by wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent and WWTP effluent comprises the majority of the flow in the river throughout most of the year (Allen 2002, 2003). It is crucial to begin to understand how Santa Ana Suckers are responding to both acute and chronic exposure to WWTP effluents and the potential population consequences of exposure. Many WWTPs discharge to the environment a mixture of endocrine disrupting contaminants (EDCs), particularly estrogens and estrogen mimics (Kolpin et al. 2002). Long-term exposure to low-dosages of estrogenic EDCs can have adverse effects on survival, reproduction, and population viability (Mills and Chichester 2005, Schwindt et al. 2015), and removal of estrogenic contaminants can improve population recovery (Barber et al. 2012, Blanchfield et al. 2015). The Santa Ana sucker may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of WWTP-derived EDCs. Many estrogenic EDCs bioconcentrate in stream biofilms (Writer et al. 2011), resulting in elevated exposure of benthic grazing organisms like the Santa Ana sucker (Greenfield et al. 1970). Surface waters of the Santa Ana River have been demonstrated to be estrogenic in vivo in the mosquitofish, and in vitro in yeast-based estrogen screen assay (Jenkins et al. 2009). However, biomarkers of endocrine disruption have not yet been evaluated in Santa Ana suckers inhabiting these WWTP effluent impacted habitats. The preliminary work outlined in this proposal will evaluate histological and molecular biomarker responses to estrogenic EDCs. The presence or absence of biomarker responses will inform managers on the potential for EDC-induced reproductive impairment as a contributor to population recovery, and inform future management and research options. || The Santa Ana sucker (Catostomus santaanae) is a federally threatened fish to the larger streams of southern California's Los Angeles Basin: the Los Angeles, San Gabriel, and Santa Ana River watersheds in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties. The Santa Ana Sucker population in the Santa Ana River is living in an effluent dominated system and current habitat restoration efforts may not be sufficient to overcome the negative consequences of WWTP effluent exposure. Ourstudy will provide a preliminary assessment of potential negative effects of exposure to waste water effluent, particularly exposure to estrogenic compounds. The project is being conducted with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the San Bernadino Valley Municipal Water District, University of Colorado, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Understanding the potential influence of water quality on Santa Ana Suckers is a high priority for the recovery and management of this endangered species and , the conservation group has concerns about long term reproductive health and the stability of the Santa Ana River sucker population. It is essential that managers have a firm understanding of the potential reproductive consequences of waste water exposure on the Santa Ana Sucker. | | |[ Breeding Ecology of Cinnamon Teal Within the San Luis Valley, CO ](/coopunits/project/151974021120/csetash) | December 2019 || The USFWS Service Regulations Committee (SRC) in 2009 requested an assessment of the harvest potential of three North American teal species; one of which was the cinnamon teal. The assessment, as envisioned by the SRC, included five areas of interest one of which was a description of the population dynamics of each species (Teal Assessment Team 2013). The cinnamon teal is one of the least studied waterfowl species in North America. Reliable, accurate demographic information is needed to determine population status and responses to harvest and habitat management. Little monitoring information is available for cinnamon teal, so as a first step to evaluating recruitment, this project is focused on estimating reproductive parameters (nest survival, hen success and fidelity, and duckling survival) and how they relate to habitat variables, in a major breeding area, Monte Vista NWR in the San Luis Valley, CO. Results will proved baseline demographic data for this population of teal, and will inform refuge managers about the effects of conditions created by refuge management and water availability on cinnamon teal.

The importance of stream temperature is well recognized especially in light of a changing climate where there will be a major shift in temperature and precipitation in the 21st century. To this end, the 2016 WRRI Student Grant funded deployment of a stream temperature and intermittency-monitoring network in Willow Creek, Gila National Forest, New Mexico. Willow Creek is home to a population of Gila trout (Oncorhynchus gilae) that were once extirpated in the 2012 Whitewater-Baldy Wildfire. Preliminary data Willow Creek revealed a maximum seven-day weekly average temperature of 15.6\u00b0C. The maximum daily range increased from 11.28\u00b0C to 20.87\u00b0C. The maximum 2-hour average was 20.85\u00b0C. From the literature, the 7-day chronic sub-lethal temperature for Gila trout is 28.25\u00b0C. Thus, these temperatures throughout Willow Creek were not an immediate threat to Gila trout persistence in Willow Creek. Temperature data continues to be collected through the summer months when lowest flows occur. The implementation of this monitoring network will allow for further data collection and analysis of Willow Creek as a long-term recovery stream. || Management of imperiled fishes of greatest conservation need in the arid Southwest requires an understanding of their habitat.

Rio Grande cutthroat trout is the southernmost subspecies of cutthroat trout and endemic to the Rio Grande, Canadian, and Pecos River basins of Colorado and New Mexico. The subspecies is reduced to less than 11% of its historic range with most populations occupying isolated high elevation headwater streams. One of the greatest threats to its survival is the effect that low stream flow due to drought will have on this coldwater trout living at the edge of its range. Our work provides insight into the current and future threats of RGCT populations under environmental and biological pressures. We investigated the effects of stream temperature, stream flow, and food resources has on reproduction, survival, population growth, and recruitment of young into the population. We developed population models using these effects to better understand the risks to RGCT persistence. Lastly, we explored the consequences of climate on RGCT population productivity through the characterization of the prey base. We found evidence that RGCT reached maturity fastest at sites with warm stream temperatures and low densities. We did not find a strong relationship between discharge and any demographic rate, although apparent survival of mature RGCT decreased as stream temperature increased. Our study suggests plasticity in trait expression may be a life-history characteristic which can assist trailing edge populations like RGCT to persist in a changing climate. || Rio Grande cutthroat trout (RGCT; Oncorhynchus clarkia virginalis) are the southernmost subspecies of cutthroat trout and currently occupy less than 12% of their historic range. Loss of habitat due to competition and hybridization with introduced trout and habitat alteration has restricted the remaining 122 populations to small (5.8 km median length) isolated habitat patches. A stream temperature and discharge monitoring program also identified that the majority of occupied habitat patches, while currently thermally suitable for the subspecies, have very low summer baseflows (< 1.0 cfs) which restrict fish movement and increases the risk of population extirpation due to stochastic disturbances (i.e., drought). We used otoliths and multistate capture-mark-recapture data collected along a temperature and stream drying gradient to assess life-history traits and persistence of RGCT. We found evidence that RGCT reached maturity fastest at sites with warm stream temperatures and low densities. We did not find a strong relationship between discharge and any demographic rate, although apparent survival of mature RGCT decreased as stream temperature increased.

Use of minnow traps with an index of abundance (i.e., catch-per-unit-effort, CPUE) for White Sands pupfish (Cyprinodon tularosa) can be affected by basic methodological choices such as trap soak time (i.e., effort) as well as the timing and location of trap placement. Movement into and out of minnow traps by the pupfish affected CPUE. White Sands pupfish exited traps at frequencies that were nearly equivalent to the rate of entering, suggesting total catch and thereby CPUE, are strongly influenced by factors that determine the probability of an animal exiting the trap. In addition, CPUE was weakly correlated with a more robust estimate of abundance (Lincoln-Peterson estimator) suggesting CPUE is not a good index for abundance especially when trap soak times are variable.<br><br>Validation of Otolith Deposition in Laboratory and Field-reared White Sands Pupfish - Otolithic organs (earbones in fish) can be used to accurately evaluate the age of a fish. If otolith increments are deposited daily and time of hatch (onset) is known. <br><br>Reproductive Strategies of White Sands Pupfish inhabiting Stable versus Unstable Habitats - White Sands pupfish was used to test the hypothesis that mate choice strategies are influenced by environmental stability. Wild fish were collected from two locations each characterized by either highly variable flows marked by stream drying and extreme temperatures or stable flows with consistent diel patterns of water temperature. Detectable differences were observed between pupfish from stable versus unstable stream environments in both the distribution of eggs. Additionally, reproductive effort was detectably different between fish from stable versus unstable environments. These results suggests that reproductive investment may decrease as habitat stability decreases due to the breakdown of reliable reproductive signals. || Fish sampling in desert cienega systems are logistically challenging. The small size of the White Sands pupfish (Cyprinodon tularosa) adds to the monitoring challenge. While these fish are locally abundant, they are short-lived and can alter their reproductive strategy as environmental conditions vary. Use of minnow traps with an index of abundance (i.e., catch-per-unit-effort) for White Sands pupfish can be affected by basic methodological choices such as trap soak time (i.e., effort) as well as the timing and location of trap placement. We tested current sampling techniques to provide alternative methodologies to natural resource managers tasked to monitor the species. We worked with the Environmental Stewardship Branch of the Department of Army, White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Our research provided alternatives to the use of passive capture traps in characterizing White Sands pupfish populations throughout a desert cienega. | | |[ Natal Source and the Influence of Environmental Bottlenecks on Largemouth Bass Recruitment in Elephant Butte Reservoir ](/coopunits/project/151893147648/alexv1) | June 2019 || Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) is the most sought after sportfish in New Mexico.

At that time, the Las Conchas fire became the largest fire in New Mexico's history. In less than one week, one-third of the Valles Caldera National Preserve (VCNP) was burned. One month after the wildfire was fully contained, a series of rains resulted in exceptionally high flows and large ash input throughout streams on the Preserve. Fish surveys following the ash-laden flood events revealed a 95% reduction in trout abundance. The severity of the fire within the catchments of these streams resulted in variable flow and elevated sediment that have affected recovery of fish assemblages and the benthic macroinvertebrate community eight years post-fire. While density of adult brown trout have increased from less than 1.0 fish/100 m2 (August 2011) to 8.0-23.8 fish /100 m2 (May 2019), fish densities remain well below pre-burn densities (51-156 fish/100 m2).

At the completion of the project, there will be a second set of face-to-face meetings where the results of the climate projections (maps of areas where forage is expected to improve or decline as a result of climate change) are delivered and stakeholders are consulted regarding the utility of the work to their issues and concerns and those issues and concerns will be noted in the final report for the modelling effort. | | |[ Connectivity for Landscape Conservation Design and Adaptation Planning ](/coopunits/project/151333023744/gabrielsenc) | November 2019 || In the Northwest Boreal and Western Alaska region, climate is changing twice as fast as the global average. This is coupled with an increase in global demand for the region's natural resources.

The CCD hosts 11 federally protected fishes and mussels. Silt loads and siltation from agriculture are the most significant threat to their persistence. Relating sediment dynamics to instream habitat conditions in the CCD is critical to identifying the habitat available for priority species and to prioritizing restoration actions. VDGIF has identified several BMPs, such as creating vegetated riparian buffers and excluding livestock from streams, as potentially contributing to recovery of imperiled species.<br>A spatially-explicit, calibrated watershed model of the CCD is needed to explain the effects that silt load, substrate embeddedness, and bank instability have on the distribution and abundance of priority fishes and mussels. In addition, measures of the effectiveness of BMPs in improving instream habitat conditions are needed to inform conservation actions.<br>OBJECTIVES:<br>1. Quantify expected magnitude of sediment load across the CCD using the SWAT watershed model.<br>2. Survey sediment dynamics and instream habitat conditions relevant to recovery of priority fishes and mussels in CCD subwatersheds.<br>3. Analyze relationships among watershed, reach, and instream habitat characteristics to map habitat quality in the CCD.<br><br>We conducted stratified-random field surveys of selected experimental units (e.g., subwatersheds, stream segments) to assess benthic habitat quality, focusing on measures that reflect effects of fine sediment on substrate composition, embeddedness, and streambed stability. Products developed per our objectives included:<br>1) a calibrated SWAT model of the CCD to be used in future conservation planning;<br>2) maps of sediment load threat and benthic habitat quality metrics critical to the recovery of priority fishes and mussels;<br>3) an investigation of the relationships between two BMP types and benthic habitat quality, and whether BMPs are associated with improvements in habitat quality (e.g., reducing sedimentation).<br><br>Our findings included four main takeaways:<br>1) Benthic habitat quality is low in numerous stream segments in CCD. Mainstem reaches suffer from excess fine sedimentation and streambed instability. Tributary reaches suffer most from excess fine sedimentation.<br>2) Sediment yield estimates suggest upland sediment supplies to stream channels in CCD are comparable to regional means.<br>3) Riparian zones were generally the most influential watershed component with respect to benthic habitat quality. The extent of riparian pasture was inversely related to benthic habitat quality.<br>4) Afforestation and cattle-exclusion BMPs were not positively related to benthic habitat quality. In the cases where BMP implementation was related most strongly to benthic habitat quality, the relations were negative (e.g. BMP deployment associated with more fine sediment).<br><br>Our findings suggest several tactics for improving benthic habitat to recover imperiled aquatic species in CCD:<br>(1) plan for and promote BMP investments that restore a more natural hydrologic regime and reduce sediment delivery to streams;<br>2) promote additional BMPs in conjunction with the widely applied fencing BMPs, so they collectively rectify agricultural impacts on benthic habitat quality;<br>3) target specific areas for conservation action based on the best available knowledge of instream and watershed conditions and BMP efficacy. || The aquatic habitats in the Copper Creek drainage (CCD) host 11 federally protected fishes and mussels but are severely impacted by fine sediments, likely resulting from cattle access to streams and scarce woody vegetation in riparian zones. Relating sediment dynamics to instream habitat conditions in the CCD is critical to identifying the habitat available for priority species and to prioritizing restoration actions. State and federal agencies commonly promote and implement BMPs to protect and restore riparian zones to aid recovery of imperiled aquatic species, but the efficacy of such BMPs is largely undocumented in the region. We used a combination of model- and field-based studies to map and establish links between watershed-scale sediment dynamics and instream habitat conditions relevant to recovery of priority fishes and mussels. Our partners included Natural Resources Conservation Service, US Fish and Wildlife Service, Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, Virginia Tech, and local Soil and Water Conservation Districts. Our findings suggest benthic habitat quality is low in numerous stream segments across the CCD due to excess fine sedimentation and streambed instability, and that riparian zones strongly influence benthic habitat quality. This research will inform conservation planning and implementation of future BMPs (e.g., fencing to exclude cattle from streams) in the CCD and other watersheds in the region. | | |[ Demographic status and population genetic differentiation of Candy Darter populations in Virginia ](/coopunits/project/151332521984/biota) | April 2020 || Candy Darter are narrowly restricted to medium-size streams with cold-cool temperatures, high-velocity riffles, and silt-free substrates.

However, populations of lake sturgeon have decreased drastically over the past two centuries. This is due to a suite of factors including overfishing, habitat loss and fragmentation, and water quality degradation. While dams have numerous benefits, they also have drawbacks that can negatively influence lake sturgeon. Lake sturgeon have regular migrations associated with spawning and feeding that can be up to 330 km. Dams impede the historic travel corridors and due to the physiology and benthic orientation of lake sturgeon make conventional fish passage (e.g. fish ladders) inaccessible for these fish. There are knowledge gaps in lake sturgeon passage such as: behavior during migration, passage design, implementation and development of operation windows, and improving assessment and monitoring of passage efforts. Our objectives are: 1) Increase knowledge on lake sturgeon behaviors near dams and to improve efficiency of the Menominee River fish elevator. 2) Experiment what attraction flows, seasonality, photoperiod, scents, and retention modifications we can make to the elevator to improve capture and efficiency. 3) Develop of home ranges and life history characteristics for these populations using radio telemetry. || Populations of lake sturgeon have decreased drastically in over the past two centuries.

Angler effort is typically estimated using creel surveys, although surveys are rarely conducted on most lakes due to costs and logistics. When creel surveys are possible, small sample sizes (few interviews) may lead to large variance and poor confidence intervals associated with estimates of effort. The objective of this study was to determine if use of low-cost remote vehicle counters can be used to estimating trends in angler effort. During the spring of 2015, vehicle counters (n = 40) were buried at boat ramps throughout the state of Wisconsin. We compared vehicle counter results to boat ramp use determined from trail cameras deployed at 14 study lakes. Linear regression was used to evaluate relationships among estimates of boat ramp use (i.e., effort). Vehicle counters explained on average 77% of the variation in the number of boats using each lake. This suggests vehicle counters can be used to remotely monitor trends in angler effort on some water bodies. Vehicle counters could provide more accurate estimates of temporal trends in angler effort through continuous monitoring at many lakes compared to sporadic counts conducted during traditional creel surveys. || Angler effort can affect both the quality and long-term sustainability of exploited fish populations. <br><br>Angler effort is typically estimated using creel surveys, although surveys are rarely conducted on most lakes due to costs and logistics.

Our results on the effects of probiotic supplements and secondary rearing designs are critical for developing effective culture methods for the state-listed yellow lampmussel (Lampsilis cariosa), and will more broadly add to the limited literature on probiotic use and secondary rearing designs in freshwater mussel culture. | | |[ Determining Optimal Elevation for Restoration of an Island Used by Rare Colonial Nesting Waterbirds ](/coopunits/project/151264489472/kriten1) | June 2019 || We are evaluating the effects of flooding/elevation, nest predation, and other factors on nest success of several species of colonial nesting waterbirds. Ultimately, we are interested in determining the optimal elevation for island restoration based upon the balance between flood risk and island occupancy by mammalian predators || Several rare species of colonial nesting waterbirds nest at Rabbit Island, Louisiana. However, the island floods frequently and causes nest failure. LDWF is going to restore the island at a cost of about $40 million so information is needed on the optimal target elevation for restoration that minimizes flood risk and occupancy of the islands by mammalian predators. The LSU School of Renewable Natural Resources provided the first year of stipend funds; Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries is working closely with us and will fund the final 1.5 years of the project. This information will be used to minimize costs of island restoration and maximize benefits. Too low of island height leads to nest failure by flooding and too high of elevation increases the probability of occupancy by woody vegetation and mammalian predators. | | |[ Developing a high-throughput SNP panel for walleye in Wisconsin and Minnesota ](/coopunits/project/151262369792/mbootsma) | August 2019 || Historically, stocking and management practices for walleye (Sander vitreus) have been based on estimates of spawning and recruitment success, which are typically informed by survey catch data. These management strategies are aimed at increasing the success of future recruitment by selectively protecting individuals belonging to life stages thought to play critical roles in reproductive success. Recruitment is more than a factor of just population size; it can be heavily influenced by genetic interactions within and among populations, with fitness being influenced by factors such as gene flow, genetic erosion, and outbreeding and inbreeding depression. Our research objective is to use restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing to genotype ~5,000 genetic markers in 20 populations of walleye from Wisconsin and Minnesota, from which, a panel of ~200 high quality SNP markers will be defined. Our SNP panel will allow for more cost and time effective stock evaluation and large-scale pedigree analysis, which will lead to more informed decision making and improved long-term management of inland walleye fisheries. || Walleye are one of the most highly sought after and harvested fish species in the upper Midwest. Walleye abundances have recently decreased in many northern lakes including those in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Genetic tools can be used to define management units for walleye, design more effective propagation programs for restoration, and conduct parentage analysis to understand walleye biology. This research will develop novel genetic tools and resources for walleye populations in Minnesota and Wisconsin. This project is a collaboration between researchers at the USGS Wisconsin Cooperative Fishery Research Unit and the Wisconsin and Minnesota Departments of Natural Resources. The genetic resources and tools developed here will be used to improve resolution of walleye management units and inform future stocking programs. For example, these data will be used to refine management units in the Upper Wisconsin, Upper Chippewa, and Upper Mississippi drainages. | | |[ Spawning site contribution and movements of lake whitefish in northwestern Lake Michigan ](/coopunits/project/151262074880/Wes.Larson) | June 2021 || Lake whitefish support important commercial and recreational fisheries on Lake Michigan, with the northern third of the lake supporting the majority of harvest. Genetic analyses indicate lake whitefish harvest in northwest Lake Michigan (zones WI-1, WI-2, WFM-00 and WFM-01) represents a mixed-stock fishery largely supported ( 75%) by fish assigned to Big Bay de Noc (BBDN) and Green Bay genetic stocks. Previous tagging suggested the BBDN stock spawned on reefs within BBDN and were usually recovered by the fishery in Green Bay north of Chambers Island or along the lake side of the Door Peninsula. Most fish from the Green Bay stock were thought to spawn on reefs along the lake side of Door Peninsula near North and Moonlight bays (NMB) and the majority of tags were recovered along both sides of the Door Peninsula. These studies suggest lake whitefish exhibit relatively high spawning site fidelity. However, inferring general movements from tags recovered in fisheries could be biased because fishing effort is unevenly distributed in time and space. Recruitment in both NMB and BBDN areas appears to be in decline. Conversely, whitefish assigning to multiple stocks now spawn in tributaries to Green Bay (primarily the Fox and Menominee rivers) where spawning had not occurred for nearly a century and these fish are rarely recovered outside of Green Bay ( 1%). Furthermore, age-0 lake whitefish are being captured in greater abundance at many locations, indicating population expansion, not decline. Wisconsin DNR has proposed actions to reduce harvest in the NMB area, but commercial fishers argue that whitefish behavior has changed, BBDN and NMB stocks are not functionally discrete, and recruitment failure is not occurring in Green Bay as a whole. Use of telemetry coupled with genomics will allow us to test current understanding of stock structure, stock-specific movements, and spatial distribution relative to fishing effort. We will also determine movements of tributary spawners, which have not been described in previous work. Use of telemetry and high-reward tags will also allow us to estimate mortality rates for these stocks, which are needed for determining safe harvest levels. || The Lake Whitefish fishery in northwestern Lake Michigan is comprised of multiple stocks and the movements of fish within those stocks is not well understood. <br><br>Previous studies suggested lake whitefish show relatively high spawning site fidelity, determining whether stocks are functionally discrete remains an important question for fishery managers.

Natural reproduction of muskellunge is limited, so this effort largely relies on stocking juvenile fish. Defining habitat availability and selection are the first steps in implementing habitat improvements that can effectively benefit natural reproduction. Some previous research provides initial insights regarding potential muskellunge spawning habitat, but this work did not encompass all tributaries where spawning may occur, did not address spawning site selection in relation to stocking location, and did not verify that larvae emerged at putative spawning locations. Our primary objectives are to: 1) determine the proportion of muskellunge spawning in tributaries to lower Green Bay or in Green Bay proper; 2) determine if adults return to stocking locations to spawn; 3) define habitat conditions that result in successful hatching and 4) quantify the availability of viable spawning habitat in tributaries. Our goal is to provide resource agencies with specific recommendations for future habitat projects that have the greatest potential to increase natural reproduction of muskellunge. We will provide habitat maps depicting probability of muskellunge egg deposition and/or larval production. Specifically, we will identify those areas where the probability of these events might increase with changes to habitat conditions and we will also have identified what changes in conditions need to be made.

Many agencies are actively working to improve aquatic connectivity in coastal rivers, with the specific aim of restoring diadromous fish populations, including river herring. There are several recent and future dam removals in eastern Massachusetts that will likely benefit river herring, but there is currently no planned monitoring of freshwater productivity following dam removal. We propose to sample juvenile river herring in freshwater lakes for at least 5 years after dam removal to assess patterns of river herring recovery, while simultaneously sampling lakes with current natural runs to address the following questions:<br>(1) How do juvenile river herring densities and growth vary among years and in relation to lake specific and regional environmental conditions? <br>(2) How many years following dam removal does it take to restore juvenile river herring productivity to that of a natural run?<br>We will also continue to stock two lakes with river herring, where we know the exact number of adults entering the systems, to develop relationships between adult density and juvenile density and growth, and can control stock densities under different environmental conditions.

High winter tick (Dermacentor albipictus) infestations are considered to be a major cause of these trends. The Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department utilizes population models to estimate regional moose numbers and determine appropriate management actions. Model inputs such as age structure, sex ratio, and mortality and recruitment rates are inputs to this model. Management of Vermont's moose would benefit greatly from more precise estimates of these rates and a population viability assessment. This proposal is to investigate rates of moose mortality, productivity, recruitment, and genetics of moose populations over a three-year period in Wildlife Management Units E1 and E2, which collectively constitute moose management region \"E\". This region contains 632 square miles of moose habitat, and hosts the highest moose densities (up to 1.75 moose/sq. mi), highest winter tick loads, and low deer densities. This project is a collaboration between the Vermont Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, the University of Vermont, and the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department. It builds on work done in the neighboring states of New Hampshire, Maine, and New York. The study will contribute to a broader understanding of moose population trends in the Northeast region. || In the past decade, concern has risen in Vermont and neighboring states regarding high mortality and low recruitment rates of resident moose populations. High winter tick (Dermacentor albipictus) infestations are considered to be a major cause of these trends. The rapidly declining moose population may result in the local extinction of this iconic species from Vermont. Information is needed on age-specific survival rates, cause of mortality, and habitat selection in relation to winter tick load. This project is a collaboration between the Vermont Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, the University of Vermont, the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department, and the U.S. Geological Survey. The research will provide estimates of survival and reproductive rates of moose in Vermont, and identify critical habitats and gene flow. More precise estimates of mortality and recruitment rates and the factors that affect these vital rates will provide the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department information needed to help to reverse this trend. | | |[ Understanding common loon distribution and abundance in Washington ](/coopunits/project/150906406912/sipeh) | December 2019 || The Common Loon (Gavia immer) is a State Species of Concern in Washington.

The Arctic Grayling is a species of special conservation concern, and a Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances program was established in the Big Hole River Watershed to facilitate conservation in 2006. Barriers, such as irrigation diversions, may limit the movement of Arctic Grayling; Arctic Grayling in the Big Hole Watershed move 60-80 miles throughout the year to reach spawning, refuge, and feeding habitats. Conservation actions, such as ensuring landscape connectivity, taken before a species is listed or its habitat lost can provide simpler alternatives to expensive litigation and recovery programs. Arctic Grayling are an iconic and important component of our aquatic fauna; their presence means that quality riparian habitat remains intact to support other aquatic species. The Arctic Grayling population above Great Falls, Montana, has declined significantly. Improving the conservation status of the Arctic Grayling population that resides in the Big Hole River Watershed is important to the species overall conservation status. Hydraulic structures such as irrigation diversions are common to the river systems in Montana. They are essential for providing water diversion for agriculture but can be barriers to Arctic Grayling and other aquatic species. For over a decade, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (MTFWP), USDA-Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS) Montana, Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC), local ranchers, NGOs, and others have worked to balance agricultural needs with the conservation of native fish, rivers, and streams. This partnership is a model for how conservation and agriculture can be blended to maintain and ideally improve both. Denil fishways have been installed in irrigation diversions throughout the Big Hole River Watershed to provide fish passage, with more fishways planned in this watershed and others. They are either included as part of the standard design and installation for new diversions or are installed as a retrofit to existing diversions. The Denils are made of steel, are 2 ft. in cross section, and are either 6 ft. or 12 ft. in length. They are typically installed into the pin and plank portion of the diversion with a total vertical drop of 1 ft. The effectiveness of these fishways has not been assessed and design criteria remain untested. Conservation partners need to know the efficiency of fish passage for Arctic Grayling and other aquatic species and their economics and water usage. Lack of assessment limits our ability to use an adaptive management strategy that might lead to better design features; partners maybe missing opportunities for win-win conflict resolution scenarios such as developing criteria that might increase passage success and landscape connectivity while providing more economical use of water when it is scarcest. || Hydraulic structures such as irrigation diversions are common to the river systems in arid agricultural regions but can restrict necessary fish movements. Denil fishways have been installed in irrigation diversions, and many more installations are planned, but their effectiveness has not been assessed.

Keenleyside Dam (HLK) to Grand Coulee Dam (GCD) in WA, USA] has not occurred at a rate sufficient over the past 40 years to maintain the population going forward. Conservation aquaculture has become a critical component of recovery programs, including for White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) in the lower Columbia River where extirpation has largely been avoided due to the success of hatchery-origin juveniles released into the wild. Survival of hatchery-origin juveniles in the upper Columbia River population has been higher than originally predicted, with more than 30,000 individuals estimated to be at large in the population (BC Hydro 2016a). Within the hatchery population, certain year classes are estimated to be in higher abundance than the existing wild population (~3,000 mature individuals), as a result of higher survival for year classes released at larger body size. Of further concern, within year class genetic diversity has been estimated to be reduced relative to the time of release from the hatchery (McLellan and Crossman unpublished data) as a result of disproportionate survival among maternal family groups. As a result of these findings, there is an urgent need to determine when the hatchery population will mature and begin contributing to natural spawning, as genetic swamping of the existing wild population is a risk given numbers of estimated annual breeders (121.5 \u00b1 34.7 adults (mean \u00b1 SD); Jay et al. 2014). In the wild, White Sturgeon begin maturing between the ages of 15-35 years for females and 10-12 years for males (PSMFC 1992; Billard and Lecointre 2001). When provided with conditions for maximum growth in captivity, sexual maturity can occur much earlier with males maturing as early as 3 years of age and females as early as 6 years of age (Doroshov et al. 1997) However, age at first maturity is not well documented for hatchery-origin fish in productive systems like the lower Columbia River, Canada, where growth rates are high following release into the wild and individuals are reaching a body size similar to mature adults by age 14 (BC Hydro 2016b). The hatchery population in the lower Columbia River, Canada, represents a unique opportunity to determine age and size at first maturity in hatchery-origin fish, whether the hatchery-origin fish differ in reproductive indices (Table 1) compared to wild fish, and how other variables (e.g. habitat use or environmental covariates) may influence when individuals become reproductive. This information, in combination with other ongoing monitoring, will help inform both long-term population targets and ongoing revisions to numbers of fish that are released annually from the conservation aquaculture program. Sturgeon females and males are not sexual dimorphic (Billard and Lecointre, 2001). There are several available methods to assess sex and stage of maturity in sturgeons (Webb and Van Eenennaam 2015), though direct comparison among all methods (ultrasound, endoscopy, measurement of plasma sex steroids, and biopsy) in their efficiency and reliability in assigning sex and stage of maturity are limited. Additionally, certain methods are more invasive than others limiting what may be possible for threatened or endangered populations where permitting requirements focus only on noninvasive techniques, and the most accurate method(s) that may be applied to females to assess sex and stage of maturity may differ from those that may be applied to males. This further supports the need for comparative assessments between available methods for females and males and, given the endangered status of sturgeon species globally, is applicable beyond White Sturgeon. || Conservation aquaculture has become a critical component of recovery programs, including for White Sturgeon in the lower Columbia River where extirpation has largely been avoided due to the success of hatchery-origin juveniles released into the wild.

Prior to European contact in 1778, an estimated 360-450 fishponds encompassing over 2,700 ha were in active production across the islands, contributing an estimated minimum annual yield in excess of 900,000 kg. However, changing demographics and systems of land ownership resulted in a decline in the use and upkeep of Hawaiian fishponds throughout the 19<sup>th</sup> Century. The cultural value of Hawaiian fishponds has not diminished and there has been a concerted effort from numerous community groups to restore fishponds in Hawaii since the early 1990s.

Yet, rainfall also is changing. Lab studies have demonstrated that wetting increases thermal conductance and energy expenditure of adult and juvenile endotherms, and rain may constrain foraging (energy acquisition). Any such energy constraints may be particularly significant when parents are trying to meet the needs of growing offspring, such that rain may play a critical role in demography and adaptive trait evolution of endotherms during reproduction. This may be particularly important in tropical rainforests where rain is prevalent, thermal tolerances are narrow, and temperatures are below thermoneutral levels. In response, animals may have evolved behavioral strategies and nest structures (enclosed vs open nests) to affect exposure to rain.

Enumerate total numbers of Chinook returning to spawn in the Redwood Creek basin using DIDSON sonar; 2. conduct spawning ground surveys in Redwood Creek above Prairie Creek to estimate total numbers of redds which are constructed; and 3. install and operate a rotary screw trap in Redwood Creek to monitor the abundance and condition of juvenile salmonids outmigrating from Redwood Creek. Monitoring data will be used to parameterize a life-cycle model to assess the impact of restoration efforts and climate change on the abundance of the Chinook Salmon population in Redwood Creek. || Effective fisheries management relies on understanding how populations respond to habitat modifications resulting from environmental changes and restoration efforts. Pacific Salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) rely on both freshwater and marine habitats during different phases of their life history; thus, it is necessary to monitor both adult and smolt abundances to differentiate how conditions in these different habitats influence demographic rates (i.e., survival). If monitoring data is collected over a sufficiently long time series, encompassing a range of environmental and biological conditions, it is possible to develop a robust life cycle model that can be used to discern the impact of restoration efforts and estimate the resiliency of a population to stressors, such as increased temperatures due to climate change or decreased flow due to drought. This is a collaborative effort which includes the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, U.S. Geological Survey and Humboldt State University. Using data from the project we developed a life-cycle model that incorporated various environmental (e.g., temperature, flow) covariates to estimate freshwater and marine survival of Chinook Salmon and evaluated the impact of restoration actions on Chinook Salmon populations. Results from this model suggest there is a minimal contribution of estuary-rearing juveniles to the spawning adult population and point out current limitations associated with rearing in the Redwood Creek estuary. | | |[ Towards a better understanding of Blue Suckers: validation of age determination methods & estimating the influence of temperature on aerobic scope & swimming performance ](/coopunits/project/148418428928/t.grabowski) | August 2019 || This study will provide information on two critical aspects of the biology of Blue Sucker Cycleptus elongatus [state threatened] and Rio Grande Blue Sucker Cycleptus c.f. elongatus [SGCN] necessary for developing effective conservation and management plans for the species. First, the study will validate age estimation methods used for blue suckers throughout Texas and the rest of the United States and provide a means of assessing the accuracy and precision of age estimates. In addition, this study will use swim tunnel respirometry to evaluate the influence of temperature and dissolved oxygen on the swimming performance of blue suckers. This information will allow for an assessment of how stream discharges influence the fish' ability to migrate and utilize spawning habitat. || Blue suckers are listed as species of greatest conservation need or threatened by most states throughout their range. Proper management of these riverine, migratory species requires knowledge of their life-history, which is at present poorly understood. More specifically, knowledge of the association between cohort (year class) strength and hydrology is needed for proper instream flow recommendations. This study will provide data that addresses two critical needs: (1) validation of age estimation techniques, and (2) characterization of swimming performance under various environmental simulations. The project is a collaboration of researchers across multiple agencies and includes the USGS Texas and Hawaii Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Units, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, and Texas Tech University. Validation of yearly annulus formation and evaluation of the accuracy of various structures used for aging blue suckers will provide a greater level of confidence in age estimates generated from wild-caught blue suckers. Assessments of swimming performance under various environmental conditions will improve habitat suitability models for blue suckers, particularly as they relate to discharge, current velocity, and temperature. | | |[ Impacts of CWD on white-tailed deer populations in Wisconsin ](/coopunits/project/147385819136/aketz) | June 2022 || Chronic wasting disease (CWD) was discovered in Wisconsin white-tailed deer harvested in fall 2001 and CWD prevalence has increased in all sex and age classes and increased in spatial extent ever since.

Cameras will be active from 2 Oct - 30 April. Detections of cougars at camera stations will be used to estimate cougar abundance with spatial mark-resight models. Cougar detection data will be rarified so that we can compare models populated with detections of single cougars to extended models that include multiple states, including females with kittens. To provide a comparison and test of camera stations, we will tree cougars in winter using hounds and biopsy dart them to obtain DNA samples and generate an independent measure of abundance. We will attempt to enlist local hound hunters to tree cougars and obtain samples by providing them with dart guns, sample kits, and reimbursement for expenses while sampling. We estimate 36 capture events per year in GMUs 33-35 and the same in GMUs 70, 73A, 56. We will radiocollar 18 of the captured cougars in each of the study areas to estimate space use and detection probability. || Problem:<br>Solitary predators are notoriously difficult to monitor because they occur at low densities and are elusive.

The limited abundance data currently available for predators in the Delta cover relatively few locations and periods during the year, and fishery independent population estimates are unavailable. Both native and non-native species of predator fishes inhabit the South Delta and feed on migrating smolts and there is likely significant annual and seasonal variation in the presence of absence of individual predators. Predators are likely to exhibit positive selectivity for salmonid species because they are highly caloric, are likely naive to invasive predators and have no physical defense structures; therefore are easily eaten and handled. Our ability to make qualitative inferences about the scale and effects of fish predation on the salmonid population are greatly hindered by this lack of information. Through a combination of paired electrofishing sampling and results from acoustic surveys conducted using Dual-frequency identification sonar (DIDSON), we will be able to quantify the abundance of potential predatory fish throughout our study region. || Abundance data for fish predators is in the Delta is lacking, and has been identified as a primary research need in the Delta.

Avian abundance is known to change with vegetation heterogeneity and grazing is known to affect vegetation heterogeneity, therefore, we can track vegetative patterns that occur as a result of grazing by measuring changes in avian abundance. In addition, we will link songbird abundance and breeding activity to understand the fitness consequences for avian communities with respect to grazing regimes. Breeding effort can influence the persistence of populations and existing community structure. It is therefore important to understand how grazing can affect breeding activity. || Problem:<br>Approximately 75% of sagebrush associated bird species are declining nationally including several songbird species (e.g., Brewer's sparrow, sage thrasher).

Nevertheless, given the difficulty in surveying and monitoring this herd, current levels of herd performance and the sustainability of current harvest practices have been largely unknown. Moreover, the striking alterations to habitat caused by the bark-beetle epidemic has resulted in increased concern for herd performance. The Snowy Range Moose Project commenced in March 2015 with the capture of 30 adult female moose in the Snowy Range. During the past 1.5 years, we documented mortality levels for adult female moose that were surprisingly high, and performance metrics (pregnancy, calf recruitment, nutritional condition) were less than expected given the low population density and the anticipation of a high-performing herd. Adult survival is typically high and invariable for large herbivores, which results in annual variation in recruitment of young underpinning population growth. Nevertheless, survival of adult females will ultimately dictate population trajectory when their survival is suppressed. Documented mortalities have occurred throughout the year, and were associated mostly with old females and those in poor nutritional condition. The contribution or interactive effects of disease, as has been documented in other moose populations, remains uncertain. Our overall goal is to seek a better understanding of the factors contributing to the high rates of mortality for adult female moose, along with continued monitoring of habitat and range conditions, while continuing efforts for annual monitoring. || Objectives 1) Assess survival and cause-specific mortality of adult female moose. Although understanding contributions and context of cause-specific mortality to demography is complex, we aim to place proximal causes of mortality within the context of season, habitat, age, and reproductive history when possible. 2) Evaluate patterns of habitat use of female moose as a function of habitat conditions, with specific reference towards understanding balance between thermal refuge and forage acquisition. Near ubiquitous patterns of declining populations of moose across their southern distribution has invoked the notion of a similar underlying cause, which has been thought to be climate. Although climate has altered habitat composition and forage conditions, moose also are adapted for a cold climate, and by consequence are heat sensitive. With warming conditions and altered forest canopy, the effects of the thermal environment on moose could be dramatic, and yet, are poorly understood. 3) We will conduct annual surveys for recruitment of young from radiomarked females, evaluate seasonal patterns of adult survival, continued measuring of willow production and browsing, and measuring indices of nutritional condition of harvested animals via kidney collection. 4) Assessment of riparian communities, and the effects of snow compaction by recreational snowmobiling. The Snowy Range represents one of the premier destinations for snowmobiling, and given the difficulty and danger of traveling across previously forested areas, riparian areas compose the network of trails throughout the mountain range. Given the importance of riparian areas to moose and other wildlife, the effects of snow compaction to riparian areas and willow communities is important, but unknown. 5) As part of the greater efforts in developing tools for understanding populations and to aid in making informed management decisions, we will collaborate with those of the Bighorn Moose Project to establish an Integrated Population Model for moose in Wyoming. | | |[ Evaluating Moose Demography, Habitat Use, and Browsing Interactions in the Bighorn Mountains, WY ](/coopunits/project/143118536704/lmarti52) | June 2023 || Moose in the Bighorn Mountains are not native to the area.

The general public is often unaware that these species exist due to many factors including a dissociation of fish and desert environments and limited availability of high quality underwater and surface footage of Arizona streams. Surface and underwater videography was utilized to create an educational video on Gila and Apache trout from Mount Graham streams to be displayed at a Coronado National Forest visitor center and other locations. We captured high definition quality footage with low cost equipment with the intention of enabling natural resource managers to produce similar conservation videos easily in the future. To evaluate what aspects make a conservation video most effective, the footage was shown in a public space. By analyzing which images people viewed the most, we were able to understand how we might produce more engaging presentations. Macro images, contrasting colors, texture, and movement held audience attention the longest. These results allowed us to draw conclusions about which factors and characteristics of the film contributed to optimal audience engagement. Well-designed videos will better acquaint people with species that are not commonly seen, thus aiding in their conservation.

Moapa Dace were federally listed as endangered because of their limited range, low abundance (approximately 400 at lowest point), and competition with introduced species. Prior to this work, Moapa Dace had never been successfully held in captivity for any length of time, and had never been propagated in captivity. In an effort to develop a protocol for rearing and propagating Moapa Dace in captivity, 40 fish were collected in February 2013, and an additional group of 30 fish were collected in January 2014. We were able to successfully transport and rear Moapa Dace employing slow acclimation and aggressive prophylactic treatment; feeding adults with a combination of live and frozen invertebrates and commercially available pelleted foods; and providing an artificial stream environment to them. To attempt to spawn Moapa Dace, we applied 14 different treatments, including introduction of different types of cover and different sized substrates; manipulations of photoperiod, water chemistry, and temperature; and application of hormone baths and injections. Moapa Dace were successfully propagated in one treatment left ongoing for over three months. This treatment occurred in an artificial stream and incorporated 14 broodstock from the second capture period, an additional submersible pump to direct an increased velocity along gravel and cobble substrate, and a variety of substrate sizes and artificial plants. To successfully rear and captively propagate Moapa Dace, biologists should take great care with acclimating Moapa Dace, and provide an environment similar to that experienced by fish in the wild, incorporating stream conditions and minimal human disturbance.

Moapa Dace were federally listed as endangered because of their limited range, low abundance, and competition with introduced species. Spawning by Moapa Dace has never been documented; consequently, the environmental conditions they require for this critical aspect of their life history are unknown. Knowledge of Moapa Dace spawning ecology would provide vital data for managers to manage habitat and to identify factors that induce spawning in captivity. Twelve underwater cameras were deployed in the uppermost reach of Plummer Stream to attempt to capture Moapa Dace spawning activity. Camera sites were selected systematically and represented a variety of conditions available. I quantified the available environment by dividing the field of view in front of each camera into a grid and estimating size and embeddedness of substrate, depth, stream velocity, and cover categories in each cell of every grid. Video was recorded from March through May 2012 and then watched to identify grids over which spawning occurred and their associated characteristics. From over 4,000 10-min video clips selected for analysis, 13 spawning events were identified. Moapa Dace displayed behaviors consistent with broadcasting cyprinids. For spawning, Moapa Dace selected depths from 0.11-0.17 m/sec, cobble substrate, and instream overhead cover. I could not find that they selected for any category of embeddedness or cover (i.e. open water, instream velocity shelter, instream overhead cover, or above stream overhead cover). This information will further the understanding of Moapa Dace spawning ecology in the wild.

In water, eDNA is the result of bodily secretions such as mucus, gametes, and feces. We investigated whether eDNA can be effective for characterizing fish relative abundance, biomass, and species composition in large (>200 ha) waterbodies.

We Largemouth Bass Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum electrofishing and gill netting sites with their eDNA in water samples collected at those same sites. We found no relationship between relative abundance and biomass of these fish captured by established methods and their DNA copies at individual sites or by lake section. However, we observed that eDNA reflected relative proportions of Largemouth Bass and Gizzard Shad in total catch composition for the reservoir. Furthermore, we identified seasonal differences in catch of fish species utilizing all three methods. Catch by electrofishing, gillnetting, and number of eDNA copies were higher in Spring than Fall for both species.

Identifying the habitat conditions needed by these species is critical for their successful management. Habitat suitability criteria are commonly used to conserve species of interest. Therefore, developing habitat suitability criteria for native fish species across multiple rivers permits better understanding of how different environments are occupied under various circumstances. We developed stream-specific and generalized criteria for Longfin Dace Pantosteus clarki, across four central Arizona streams. Over 1,200 sites were sampled using pre-positioned electrofishing devices during the 2017 summer low-flow period to identify relationships among fish presence and habitat variables (depth, velocity, and substrate class). Optimal (central 50% of range used) and suitable (central 95% of range used) ranges within each habitat variable were calculated for each stream, based on the occurrence of each species. In general, Longfin Dace occupied depths of 9.00 - 54.75 cm (14.25 - 27.25 cm) velocities of 0.00 - 0.63 m/sec (0.11 - 0.31 m/sec), and substrate (modified Wentworth scale) of 0.5 - 4.3<br>(2.1 - 3.3). Speckled Dace occupied depths of 8.25 - 74.00 cm (17.00 - 34.25 cm) velocities of 0.00 - 0.74<br>m/sec (0.16 - 0.43 m/sec), and substrate of 0.0 - 4.5 (2.2 - 3.6).

In 2019, an additional stream was surveyed, Fossil Creek, to improve the accuracy of general habitat suitability data for native desert fishes, and to develop habitat suitability indices for fishes in a travertine system. Results from this project are currently being prepared for a theses, and results from both projects are being submitted/prepared for publication.

Physical habitat has been defined through habitat suitability criteria (HSC) for these vulnerable populations yet has been primarily limited to depth, flow, and substrate. The relationship between riparian vegetation and instream habitat on fish communities in the arid southwest United States is uncertain. The relationship needs to be assessed in order to implement management practices to conserve fish populations of interest. Four streams within central Arizona (Verde River, Blue River, San Francisco River, Tonto Creek) were selected based on high priority. Over 1,200 sites, throughout the streams, were sampled using pre-positioned electrofishing devices during the 2017 summer low-flow period to identify relationships among fish presence and riparian and instream habitat variables (overhead canopy, bank stability, bank vegetation type, grazing pressure, presence of undercut banks and overhanging vegetation, and percentage of aquatic vegetation and large woody debris) using both in-stream measurements and ArcGIS. Currently, logistic regression models are being constructed for these habitat variables on the presence of several fish species. This research will allow agencies in the arid southwestern United States to better manage riparian areas to benefit fish populations accordingly. Field work and data analysis are underway for this project, and results will be presented in a publication and a thesis.

Conserving these species requires knowledge of what physical and biological conditions enable them to live at a particular location. Mining companies and others want to harvest flood flows in addition to baseflows in Southwestern streams. In late summer 2015, expert witnesses were questioned in a recent Arizona water rights trial on the importance to fish of the five different parts of the hydrograph (water level, flow duration, rate of change, frequency, and timing as outlined by Poff et al. 1997), and the effects of altering these. Our current knowledge is focused primarily on the need for adequate baseflow, and some on flood flow; however, information about the relative importance of various other parts of the hydrograph could improve our management decisions, especially because water interests want to harvest parts of the hydrograph outside of baseflow. The goal of this project is to identify relationships between select native and nonnative fish species presence with the five components of the hydrograph described above. Hydrograph components will be expressed in two ways: as discharge and mean velocity, and history of these flows and their relationship with fish presence will be examined as well. Flow information is being obtained from field observations, available data from in-stream flow models and USGS gauging stations. Fish presence data is being obtained from prepositioned electrofisher surveys. Additional information from a collaboration with AZGFD will be used to examine changes in populations with changes in discharge over time. This information will improve in-stream flow management, inform the use of flow management to manage interactions among native and nonnative fishes, provide additional information for habitat improvement projects, and help provide information for upcoming water rights litigation. Field work on this project started spring, 2017 and was completed in fall, 2017. Data analysis is currently underway. A thesis resulted from this project, and publications are currently being prepared.

Pre-positioned areal electrofishing devices (PAEDs) have been developed to survey stream fishes and develop habitat suitability criteria. PAEDs, which consist of a shore-based generator and a submerged electrical grid, are less intrusive than other electrofishing methods and result in little to no fright bias, i.e., flight response, in fishes from the electrical stimuli. Standard practice allots eleven minutes post- implementation of the devices to allow fishes to recolonize the area. Thus, these low-cost apparatuses can sample distinct areas of stream reaches to assess the microhabitat of fishes. Challenges to using PAEDs include speed of deployment and difficulty of their transport to remote areas. Here we compare various forms of PAEDs to establish a technique for effective fish sampling at remote sites that considers fright bias, fish mortality, and the size of the electrical field. A digital multimeter and underwater videography were used to assess the electrical fields of various PAED designs and the fright bias induced by different techniques. We found that modified 8 PAEDs connected directly to a boat-mounted AC power source were sufficient for sampling desert fishes without inducing mortality or fright bias. Also, neither using two devices simultaneously nor using a 30-m extension cord affected voltage near the electrodes. This study demonstrated effective ways that PAEDs can be used to sample stream fishes in remote areas when collecting microhabitat parameters.

However, due to the relatively recent transition to off-bottom culture, few studies have addressed how and whether off-bottom oyster culture affects species use and abundance or whether these differences affect the overall food web ecology of the system. We will examine how off-bottom oyster culture influences the benthic invertebrate community in Humboldt Bay, California's second largest estuary. || The project will examine the environmental impacts of shellfish aquaculture by furthering the understanding of how benthic invertebrate communities are affected by the presence of Cultch-on-Longline oyster aquaculture. | | |[ Linking Exposure to Sub-lethal Stressors to Individual Vital Rates and Population Abundance ](/coopunits/project/137287278592/Mike.Mitchell) | September 2021 || 1. Sample across a gradient of wetlands with differing levels of brine contamination in the Prairie Pothole region of the Williston Basin (Montana and North Dakota).

(Note: This component is already being done by B. Hossack and others.) 2. Estimate abundance and community richness of amphibian larvae in reference wetlands and wetlands impacted by energy development in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana. This will be done using 2 capture sessions with unbaited minnow traps. For tiger salamanders, we will batch-mark larvae based on capture session and estimate abundance with capture-mark-recapture methods. For frog larvae that are less amenable to marking, we will use N-mixture models to estimate abundance. Community richness will be estimated using the pooled dataset. || Problem:<br>Wildlife management will be more effective and less expensive when managers can quickly identify populations that are most susceptible to decline.

Impacts of wildfire are highly variable; some areas experience only modest changes and are quick to recover while other areas incur profound changes to aquatic biota, in-stream habitat, water quality, watershed hydrology, hillslope erosion, and sediment transport. While the biota of some streams recover very quickly (e.g., 2-4 years), in other cases, the trajectory of recovery can be very slow and take decades. Further, in some cases, these impacts only affect areas within or near the burned area, while in other cases the impacts are propagated far downstream. At present we have very limited ability to predict which parts of the landscape, and thus which populations of fish, are most likely to be negatively affected by fire. Similarly, we have little basis for projecting ecosystem recovery and prioritizing areas for fish populations. Such knowledge could inform future pre-fire forest and fish conservation management practices as well as post-fire burned area emergency response efforts and stream restoration/rehabilitation practices. We are studying the area burned by the 2010 Twitchell Canyon fire as a case study to understand post-fire landscape and biotic response, towards a goal of informing future management of both landscapes and fish in the face of fire. This project will address four general interdisciplinary questions: 1) Based on the geomorphic setting and combination of fire, rainfall and other environmental variables, why were some creeks more impacted than others? What are the most meaningful metrics to quantify impacts? 2) How significant was the landscape response from this event compared with other wildfires in the same area and how do erosion rates estimated from this event compare to the long-term (millennial-scale average, i.e., natural background) rates of erosion? 3) What is the trajectory of biological and physical recovery and does it vary predictably within and among streams? 4) Using the environmental and biological data available, can we generate a predictive model of post-fire ecosystem response, which accounts for effects of the North American monsoon, at the landscape level? || Wildfires can cause significant disturbances to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

At present we have very limited ability to predict which parts of the landscape, and thus which populations of fish, are most likely to be negatively affected by fire. Similarly, we have little basis for projecting ecosystem recovery and prioritizing areas for fish populations. Such knowledge could inform future pre-fire forest and fish conservation management practices as well as post-fire burned area emergency response efforts and stream restoration/rehabilitation practices. We are studying the area burned by the 2010 Twitchell Canyon fire as a case study to understand post-fire landscape and biotic response, towards a goal of informing future management of both landscapes and fish in the face of fire. This project will address four general interdisciplinary questions: 1) Based on the geomorphic setting and combination of fire, rainfall and other environmental variables, why were some creeks more impacted than others? What are the most meaningful metrics to quantify impacts? 2) How significant was the landscape response from this event compared with other wildfires in the same area and how do erosion rates estimated from this event compare to the long-term (millennial-scale average, i.e., natural background) rates of erosion? 3) What is the trajectory of biological and physical recovery and does it vary predictably within and among streams? 4) Using the environmental and biological data available, can we generate a predictive model of post-fire ecosystem response, which accounts for effects of the North American monsoon, at the landscape level? | | |[ Black Rail ecology to inform effective survey design and support population modeling ](/coopunits/project/136760322048/david.tilson) | August 2021 || The Black Rail is currently under review by the USFWS for protection under the Endangered Species Act.

Mitigating sediment from road networks remains a priority for management agencies. Restoring roaded landscapes is becoming increasingly important for many native coldwater fishes that disproportionately rely on public lands for persistence. However, effectively targeting restoration opportunities requires a comprehensive understanding of the effects of roads across different ecosystems. The Southwestern Crown of the Continent (SWCC) is an area of over 6,070 square kilometers in western Montana. Within the SWCC over 1,200 km of roads are currently being considered for restoration by the US Forest Service. A recent study in the SWCC indicated considerable variability in sediment production from roads. Specifically, recent findings suggest considerable variability in sediment production across road segments and relatively low sediment production from the majority of roads in the SWCC. However, relatively high suspended sediment within streams and high nutrients in local lacustrine environments remain, rendering some uncertainty in how sediment from roads may be affecting aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, additional uncertainty remains in how road use and the interactions with precipitation may lead to sediment and nutrient pulses. As activities in the SWCC increase in the near future, a unique opportunity exists to evaluate how such increases in travel (and probably sediment production) alter our current understanding of the importance of roads and road restoration in the SWCC and elsewhere. We are conducting an in-depth field study in the SWCC to monitor and refine our understanding of how roads and sediment delivery from increased use (and other activities and disturbances) influences sediment and water quality in aquatic habitat. The project specifically builds off of existing data to establish a set of treatment and control sampling locations for suspended sediment and nutrient and streambed sediment data collection. Furthermore, we are capitalizing on existing data from the SWCC to effectively design a suspended sediment study that complements existing data. || Unpaved forest roads remain a pervasive disturbance on public lands.

Along with our Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks and USGS NoRock partners, we sought to identify the factors that determine their current and future establishment (i.e., successful recruitment) in the upper Yellowstone River. We hypothesized that reduced age-0 growth potential in upstream reaches limits recruitment through size-selective overwinter mortality, and tested this hypothesis by sampling age-0 individuals across a broad longitudinal extent from 2016 to 2019 to describe their distribution, size at the onset of winter, thermal experience, diet, and otolith-inferred hatch dates and growth rates. The upstream extent of age-0 fish was 111 to 145 RKM downstream of that of adults. Median size at the onset of winter was not significantly different across the study area. Comparative hatch dates, growth rates, and growth durations were also counter to our predictions. These results suggest that age-0 overwinter mortality is not currently preventing upstream establishment in the Yellowstone River. || Non-native smallmouth bass were thought to be limited to the warm, downstream waters of the Yellowstone River, Montana, but adults were recently observed far upstream in coldwater reaches that support a major trout fishery.

Suppression techniques including chemical, mechanical, and biological controls are commonly used to manage invasive species. Understanding the ecosystem-level influence of suppression techniques selected by natural resource agencies is essential for establishment of successful mitigation against invasive species and assisting native populations in an altered ecosystem. Invasive Lake Trout within Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming have greatly reduced the abundance of native Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout and disrupted the ecosystem through food-web alteration. The National Park Service gillnets juvenile and adult Lake Trout, and a portion of the Lake Trout carcasses collected are subsequently placed on Lake Trout spawning sites to suppress embryo development. The novel concentration of nutrients from Lake Trout carcasses could further influence the adult stages of Lake Trout and Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout by providing concentrated areas of prey not historically available. We will determine if carcass material is changing the diets of fishes in Yellowstone Lake and the trophic structure of the food web using diet and stable isotope analysis. We collected diets from 1,025 fishes in Yellowstone Lake and tissue from 359 individual fish during the 2018 field season. This study will provide information that will allow for an understanding of the consequences associated with a novel-suppression action in Yellowstone Lake. || Invasive species introductions cause reductions in populations of native species and are associated with negative environmental and economic effects.

Habitat losses are often most prominent in littoral zones and are driven by regular and sometimes extreme water level drawdowns mandated by the operational goals of the reservoir. These fluctuations generally limit successful establishment of aquatic and terrestrial plants. Consequently, expansive mudflats form along the shores of reservoirs that are aesthetically displeasing, promote erosion, increase water turbidity when flooded, and cause various ecological problems in aquatic ecosystems.

Despite occupying a highly visible and elevated trophic position in estuarine and oceanic ecosystems, movement parameters describing habitat use patterns, foraging behaviors, and migratory corridors are undeveloped at multiple spatial and temporal scales. This study aims to address these information gaps by outfitting breeding adult pelicans with high-resolution GPS satellite transmitters, which will provide accurate locational data throughout the annual life-history cycle. We will use these data to (1) examine movement and behavior of individual pelicans during the passage of hurricanes, (2) evaluate the risk exposure of pelican colonies to ship-based oil spills within Charleston Harbor, SC, using modeling products developed by NOAA, (3) assess the usage of discarded bycatch from shrimp trawlers by adult pelicans in relation to reproductive output by pairing movement data with diet samples, stable isotope analysis, and chick corticosterone concentrations, and (4) investigate the drivers of partial migration in brown pelicans and subsequently model shifts in both migration probability and non-breeding range of brown pelicans under multiple climate change scenarios. || Brown Pelicans have been understudied in the southeastern US and the sparse availability of data for pelicans (as well as other nearshore seabirds in the region such as Royal Tern, Sandwich Tern, and Black Skimmer) has resulted in a relatively incomplete picture of pelican ecology in a baseline environment. As such our understanding of habitat use at sea, population trends, and reproductive success for pelicans is very limited. Furthermore, the potential for an overlap between use areas of Brown Pelicans in the marine environment and proposed or existing offshore energy activities may be substantial in the region. We are collaborating with state agencies (SC, GA, FL), BOEM, and the USGS Outer Continental Shelf Program to study spatial and reproductive ecology of pelicans in the region. Data will be used to generate distribution maps and movement models showcasing breeding ranges, migratory pathways, wintering locations, and site fidelity. This information will greatly expand our knowledge of this charismatic species in the Atlantic, and complement prior research recently conducted on Brown Pelicans in the Gulf of Mexico. | | |[ Restoration of elk to northeastern Minnesota ](/coopunits/project/134843633664/walbe032) | June 2019 || This research will determine areas of suitable habitat and levels of public support for restoring elk to Northeastern Minnesota.

Specifically this project will: (1) Undertake a comprehensive land use study of existing lands and newly settled land claims of the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe in the Northern Forest based on social-ecological mapping of hotspots where geographical areas of human and ecological values overlap; (2) Develop an innovative, comprehensive, and culturally relevant stewardship strategy for existing and newly settled land claims of the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe; (3) Create audio visual curriculum material on sustainable forest management and land stewardship for use in high school and undergraduate environmental science education. This project will combine Native American ecological knowledge and scientific understanding to achieve sustainable forest management, addressing ecological, economic, and sociocultural needs. || The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe (SRMT) governing body in the southern portion of Akwesasne is in the process of purchasing lands to be placed into trust - up to 13,000 acres from willing sellers. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is responsible for overseeing this land, along with the other 56.2 million acres of lands in trust for various Indigenous Communities and Individuals. Within this framework, SRMT is a category 2 tribe, which requires an approved Forest Management Plan or only very limited and restricted management can occur. We are developing a biologically and culturally informed forest stewardship strategy within the context of land claim areas in partnership with SRMT and grounded in the community. It contributes to an important cultural responsibility of SRMT to the land and community and aids them in asserting their rights over their lands. Akwesasne, sovereign Mohawk community, holds a unique geographic location along the US and Canadian border. It is culturally, environmentally and politically diverse. It has a land base of approximately 14,648 acres of land on the American side, which will be expanded in the land claims process, and 7,400 acres of land on the Canadian side. The different variables that affect the lives of community member in tandem with biological information and cultural knowledge will aid in the development of the context-specific forest stewardship strategy. | | |[ A macrosystems ecology framework for continental-scale prediction and understanding of lakes ](/coopunits/project/134249607168/txw19) | September 2023 || In the past decade, our understanding of how inland waters influence regional, continental, and global biogeochemical cycles has fundamentally changed. We have moved from discounting their contributions, to now recognizing these ecosystems as significant hotspots for the storage and transformation of nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon. This realization has come about through careful and labor-intensive collection, integration, and synthesis of often-scattered data sources, combined with a variety of different approaches to extrapolate site-level measures to unsampled sites across regions and continents. Today, although this view of the role of inland waters in large-scale cycling is supported by numerous studies, substantial gaps in our understanding remain. Estimates for the same flux (e.g., organic carbon burial in lakes) often differ substantially among studies. Further, most attempts to quantify continental or global fluxes or pools come with caveats regarding the often high- and often unknown- uncertainty associated with these estimates. To better understand the role of inland waters in macroscale nutrient cycling, new approaches are needed to reduce uncertainty in extrapolating site-level estimates to larger geographical scales. The overarching goal of this research is to understand and predict nutrient patterns for ALL continental US lakes to inform estimates of lake contributions to continental and global cycles of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C), while also providing locally valuable information about conditions in unsampled lakes. || Inland waters are significant hotspots for the storage and transformation of nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon and influence regional, continental, and global biogeochemical cycles.

We intend to estimate rate of uptake, accumulation, persistence, and concentration of neonicotiniods in native prairie plants on US Fish and Wildlife Service remnant native and restored grasslands in the Prairie Pothole Region. || Neonicotinoids are a class of neuro-active insecticides developed in the 1990s because of widespread pest resistance and environmental objections to organophosphorus insecticides. In developed countries, neonicotinoids are predominantly used as seed treatments but their widespread use is partly due to their flexibility of use (i.e., foliar sprays on horticultural crops, direct applications to soil and water). While large-scale use of neonicotinoid insecticides started around 2004, neonicotinoids are now the most widely used class of insecticides world-wide. However, only a small portion of the insecticide actually reaches its intended target; only 1.6-20.0% of imidacloprid applied via seed coating enters and provides protection to the crop; the remaining 80-98.4% accumulates in soil and water. Recent concern over neonicotinoids is, in part, due to their acute toxicity to non-target species such as birds, mammals, bees, butterflies, and aquatic invertebrates. However, limited data exists concerning the uptake of neonicotinoids on non-target plants. Given the persistence and accumulation of neonicotinoids in soil and water, uptake by non-target plant species would be expected. However, data on persistence of neonicotinoids once absorbed by plants are sparse and accumulation in plant tissue may be species-specific. In this study we endeavor to estimate rate of uptake and accumulation of neonicotinoids in native plants in South Dakota on U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service remnant native and restored grasslands as a function of surrounding land use, estimate presence and concentration of neonicotinoids in soils, and estimate the decay function of neonicotinoids as it relates to the distance from crop fields as a function of native plant and soil contamination. These data will provide important information to guide management of native and restored grasslands, especially those intended to promote the health and persistence of pollinating insects. | | |[ Amphibian Occupancy and Effects of Habitat Use on Chemical Exposure in Northern Leopard Frogs (Lithobates pipens) in Iowa Prairie Pothole Wetlands ](/coopunits/project/134187716608/swanson2) | December 2018 || Amphibians living in agricultural areas encounter many challenges. Two factors affecting individuals in these landscapes are habitat loss and pesticides. This project focused on amphibians using agricultural wetlands in Iowa, where row crops such as corn and soybeans dominate the landscape. The goal of the first study was to determine the influences of site characteristics on amphibian presence and success. Occupancy analysis was used to estimate proportion of area occupied by four species as a function of eight covariates hypothesized to affect occupancy: fish abundance, salamander abundance, invertebrate density, vegetative cover, wetland area, water atrazine concentration, surrounding crop land use, and overall wetland health score. The goal of the second study was to understand where and when frogs are most susceptible to pesticide exposure and how that exposure relates to accumulation. We hypothesized habitat use would influence a frog's exposure to pesticides. 72 Northern Leopard Frogs (Lithobates pipiens) were radio tracked in agricultural wetlands and their survival was assessed. Passive Sampling Devices (PSDs) were used to test for differences in pesticide exposure among grassland, wetland, and agricultural habitats. || Amphibians living in agricultural areas encounter many challenges.

Harvest information, tooth age, and reproductive tract data has been gathered annually by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources since 2006, but this information has not been utilized to its full extent, particularly with otters. Accurate population monitoring is critical to meet management and conservation goals, and is especially important considering inclusion on CITES Appendix II of both bobcats and otters. The goal of our project is to create an efficient modeling framework for monitoring Iowa otter and bobcat populations using the Iowa DNR's existing data sources and augmenting it with additional auxiliary information. We will specifically be able to evaluate the role and effectiveness the annual bow hunter survey in monitoring these species, as bobcats are better represented on this survey than otters. | | |[ Safe operating space for walleye: adapting inland recreational fisheries for climate change ](/coopunits/project/134143285248/bdavis) | May 2022 || Climate change affects inland recreational fisheries by influencing lake thermal structure, water clarity, habitat, and other factors that influence economically valuable sport fishes. The Safe Operating Space (SOS) for a given fishery is the range of biophysical and social conditions that allows for self-sustaining populations of target species. Walleye, a socially and economically important sportfish across much of North America, is undergoing declines due to recruitment failures in many lakes throughout their range. Studies of the SOS for Walleye suggest that many factors are involved, including warming and changes in thermal structure, loss of habitat, increasing clarity (perhaps due to drought), and biotic interactions with other fish species. We propose research to identify mechanisms behind recruitment failures that will help inform rehabilitation of Walleye recruitment and populations. In a whole-lake experiment we will remove centrarchid fish species. In parallel, we will conduct a structured comparison of lakes with contrasting habitat and centrarchid densities to evaluate the effects of water clarity, growing degree days, and predation mortality on young-of-year growth and survivorship of Walleye. Results of these studies, in combination with simulation modeling and additional analyses of long-term data from lakes in Northern Wisconsin, will sharpen our understanding of the SOS for Walleye and inform a new vision for recreational fisheries management in a changing climate. Members of the research team work closely with fisheries managers, which will foster a regular exchange of information. Results will also be communicated to managers through regular management workshops, as well as technical papers in the scientific literature. || Global change, including large scale changes in climate, land use, hydrology, and biogeochemistry, creates unprecedented pressure on inland recreational fisheries. Local fish managers have little influence on these large-scale changes, but they can manipulate factors such as harvest, food web structure, and some features of habitat. <br><br>The Safe Operating Space (SOS) concept establishes a framework for analyzing a fishery in the context of both large-scale and local factors.

It is very difficult to detect remnant individuals using traditional survey methods. Environmental DNA shed from mussels can be used to detect them in low abundances and in environments where traditional surveys are not feasible. Development of environmental DNA methods for mussels is necessary to utilize this technique. This project is a collaboration between the Wisconsin Cooperative Fishery Research Unit, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.

This positive by-product creates additional opportunities for those who participate in small-game hunting. However, the concurrent pursuit of two species with similar habitat requirements may create conflicts among hunters or affect the demography or behavior of one or both of the species. Rabbit hunting, in particular, has the potential to disrupt bobwhite movements and behavior given the nature of pursuit involving large hunting parties and packing dogs. This disruption may subsequently affect bobwhite survival and/or bobwhite hunter satisfaction. This study focuses on effects of hunting at one Georgia DNR Wildlife Management Area in which activities of the two types of hunters are separated in time. Specifically, the study investigates whether rabbit hunting activity disrupts bobwhite behavior sufficiently to impact bird demography and consequently bobwhite hunter satisfaction. || Management of early successional habitat for northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) may provide as a byproduct habitat suitable for other species, such as rabbits (Silvilagus floridanus). Although this association creates additional sport hunting opportunities on the same site, concurrent pursuit of harvest objectives for two co-occurring species may create conflicts among hunters or affect demography or behavior of one or both species. Wildlife management agencies seek to increase opportunities for hunting on public areas, and strategies that appear to provide added opportunity for the same management effort are highly attractive to agencies. However, such strategies can have deleterious consequences if hunting activities directed at one species disrupts populations of the other species, ultimately leading to decreased satisfaction among hunters of that species. This research is conducted in collaboration with Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the University of Georgia. Research results will inform the Georgia Department of Natural Resources on costs - in terms of population performance and hunter satisfaction - for the perceived benefits of coincidental habitat and harvest management for two co-occurring species. | | |[ Environmental Stressors and Priority Plant Communities on Jekyll Island, Georgia ](/coopunits/project/134106533888/cmoore) | May 2020 || Jekyll Island is a Georgia barrier island that supports developed tourism amenities and a residential community, but is also a state park that is committed to conserving and managing most of the island's area as natural habitat. Natural areas on Jekyll Island are facing a multitude of environmental stresses, most of whose root causes are anthropogenic. Sea level rise, climate change, altered surface and groundwater hydrology, fire suppression, invasive species, land development, and altered wildlife abundances can all affect the dynamics of vegetation communities. Many of Jekyll Island's vegetation communities are locally or globally rare, unique to barrier islands, and highly regarded for their aesthetic and recreational values, all of which create a strong impetus for conserving the integrity of these vegetation communities and ecosystems. However, formulating natural areas management strategies is a complex challenge because of the simultaneous multiple stressors that are impacting plant communities, and the diverse range of ecological and social objectives - from biodiversity conservation and climate resilience, to tourism amenities and educational opportunities - that the Jekyll Island Authority's mission seeks to balance. To surmount these complexities, this project combines three suites of scientific studies to (1) investigate the effects of multiple stressors on vegetation structure and dynamics in three high-priority plant communities, (2) integrate field and existing data on expected management outcomes into a decision support framework, and (3) evaluate stakeholder attitudes toward management options. This approach will deliver relevant, novel ecological information on the consequences of ecological stressors on high-priority natural areas, contextualized in terms of management options, in order to facilitate the Jekyll Island Authority in conservation planning.

By involving partner groups in this work, the project is expected to synthesize data for the five priority species above and to develop models that predict population viability as a consequence of predicted exogenous threats (e.g., climate change and land use conversion) and conservation actions in space and time to mitigate those threats. These products will be delivered in a form that facilitates a future formal decision analysis in which tradeoffs in alternative conservation actions may be explored. | | |[ Assess Field- and Landscape-Level Effects of NRCS Conservation Practices on Gopher Tortoise Habitat ](/coopunits/project/134106109952/bcrawfor) | August 2020 || The Working Lands for Wildlife (WLFW) program of the Natural Resources Conservation Service provides financial incentives for private landowners to manage their lands in ways that enhance habitat suitability for wildlife species of conservation concern, including the gopher tortoise. This project has two purposes: (1) assess how well WLFW has delivered conservation benefit on enrolled properties with respect to habitat and population metrics, and (2) develop enhancements in population assessment technology to more sensitively gauge how tortoise populations respond to conservation actions in short time frames. || The NRCS Working Lands for Wildlife (WLFW) program for the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) was initiated in 2013, with enrollments in the states of Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. The program provides incentive payments to private landowners for implementing habitat management practices believed to promote sustainability of tortoise populations, but there has been no assessment of whether WLFW is achieving its goals and no identification of challenges in its implementation. A component of this research addresses enhancements to the field survey protocol used across the range of the tortoise; thus the management community will have a better tool to quantify tortoise populations. The research will also help determine if the allocation of public dollars to incentivize private landowners is having the intended effect and will further clarify how tortoise populations respond to habitat management actions across the range. Partners from USGS, NRCS, the University of Georgia, and the Joseph W. Jones Ecological Research Center are collaborating on this project. The implementation of an improved survey tool will provide more precision to management decision making. The work is also expected to inform NRCS about the effectiveness of the WLFW program in meeting habitat objectives and to identify attributes (local to landscape scale) that contribute to or impinge on the meeting of objectives. | | |[ Demographic Estimation and Conservation Modeling for the Loggerhead Sea Turtle ](/coopunits/project/134105905152/nuse) | June 2020 || Successful recovery of the threatened loggerhead sea turtle will hinge on decisions about where to invest limited resources into conservation actions, and these decisions will be informed by predictions of population response to each action. This study focuses on the development of decision or scenario planning models for the northern recovery unit of the turtle. We will first construct a demographic model by integrating data from various sources, including genetic mark-recapture data, nest counts, and in-water monitoring data. Next, we will outfit this model as a scenario/decision analysis tool and simulate the model to product output of use to managers. The main purpose of the model is to help state agency resource managers in the northern recovery unit discern the relative efficacy of actions under their control, to assess the relative contributions of stressors so that broad scope conservation strategies may be devised, and to identify key uncertainties in sea turtle demography to which targeted information gathering would yield more effective conservation delivery. || Decision-making aimed at recovering the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) from threatened status is dependent on models that evaluate population vulnerability to an array of potential threats and that assess trade-offs of alternative conservation actions. Crucial uncertainties in population mechanisms exist, and demographic models can be used to identify those uncertainties to which targeted information gathering would yield more effective conservation delivery. Conservation management for loggerhead sea turtles is uncertain because key mechanisms and components of the population are unknown, and no framework exists to evaluate trade-offs of alternative actions in the face of this uncertainty. This work will provide the needed framework to advance conservation for the turtle, and it will provide a blueprint for model development and decision analysis for related conservation problems hampered by uncertainty. This work is a collaboration between USGS, the University of Georgia, and Georgia Department of Natural Resources. This work will result in a population model that integrates multiple sources of data including genetic mark-recapture, nest counts, and in-water surveys, and it will be outfit as a scenario/decision analysis tool for generating demographic output of use to managers. Among possible scenarios investigated are those that trade off one form of management for another if total resources for conservation are capped. | | |[ Comprehensive evaluation of the Nebraska outdoor enthusiast ](/coopunits/project/134092699648/fontaine.joseph) | July 2022 || Fishing and hunting license sales and taxes on fishing and hunting equipment are vital sources of funding for wildlife management agencies, and in many cases, management objectives are met under the stewardship of sportspersons. The dependence on hunters and anglers by management agencies makes the North American Model of Conservation unique, but vulnerable to declining participation in outdoor recreation.<br><br>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service supports the National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation Survey in a nationwide effort to understand the sporting public. Conducted every five years, the National Survey identifies generalizations concerning patterns of outdoor enthusiast participation in the USA. Although useful for setting broad policy, the spatial and temporal scales of this National Survey limit the capacity for state fish and wildlife agencies to affect local participation within their states. To overcome these limitations, many state agencies conduct surveys of individual license holders. However, state surveys are often highly directed, limiting their applicability across user groups and state boundaries.<br><br> Given the challenges of both national and state surveys, there is a need to bridge the information gap and understand sportspersons at spatial and temporal scales that may more directly assist in creating hunting and angling opportunities. We are analyzing a comprehensive database on license holders in Nebraska with the goal of helping inform and direct wildlife and fisheries management, as well as recruitment and retention efforts within the state. To date, we have documented that movement of sportspersons across activity groups (hunting only, fishing only, a combination of hunting and fishing, and inactive), inferred from license purchases, is limited and varies little based on initial group participation. <br><br>In addition, we developed a customizable, open-source, web-based application\u2014huntfishapp\u2014that allows users to easily interact with a license database. The huntfishapp serves as an informational resource, provides a framework for sharing information on license sales across an agency, and allows agencies and non-governmental organizations to become more knowledgeable of their customer base. || The decline in hunters and anglers is of increasing concern to natural resource management agencies that depend on these individuals for annual funding. The dependence on hunters and anglers by natural resource management agencies makes the North American Model of Conservation unique, but vulnerable to declining participation in outdoor recreation. Comprehensive understanding of the hunting and fishing public is needed to inform and direct wildlife and fisheries management, as well as recruitment and retention efforts by natural resource management agencies. This project is a collaboration of researchers across multiple agencies and includes the University of Nebraska\u2014Lincoln and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission. Participation levels will be quantified among groups of hunters and anglers, and models will be developed to describe recruitment and development of these groups of people. Findings will help identify key socio-demographic parameters that predict movement among and retention in each of the user groups (e.g., from hunter education program to small-game hunter to angler to big-game hunter). | | |[ Kirtland AFB mountain lion study ](/coopunits/project/133833934848/jwcain) | November 2019 || Wildlife management on Department of Defense Lands is often hampered by a lack of data on specific wildlife species.

A major objective of the study is to develop a detailed understanding of the demography and population ecology of a model raptor population to obtain insights into the population ecology of harder to study species of management concern, such as golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos). We now have rigorous empirical estimates of the number of occupied Cooper's hawk nesting territories, reproductive success, survival rates, female dispersal, and spatially explicit estimates of prey density for each year of the study. We propose to undertake an analysis of genetic material and stable isotopes of feathers from the Albuquerque Cooper's hawk study population to gain additional insights into their mating system, behavioral ecology, and population genetic structure. Important questions these analyses may help answer are: (1) what factors are associated with high rates of extra-pair paternity in Cooper's hawks, and how those factors might affect individual fitness and population growth; (2) what is the frequency and potential source of immigrants into the Albuquerque study population; and (3) what is the phylogeographic relationship of this Cooper's hawk population to others that have been genetically sampled. In addition, this study presents a valuable opportunity to compare and contrast genetic estimates of population attributes (e.g., estimates of paternity certainty and of effective population size) with direct measures obtained through banding and radio telemetry. || The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been coordinating a study of the population ecology of an urban population of Cooper's hawks (Accipiter cooperii) in Albuquerque, New Mexico since 2011, in collaboration with the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish and New Mexico State University.

Like other members of the sturgeon family, lake sturgeon are long lived, slow to mature, display intermittent spawning, have high fecundity and low natural mortality. Despite their low natural mortality, these life history characteristics make them especially vulnerable to overexploitation. Lake sturgeon populations have declined throughout the range of the species due to factors including habitat loss and overfishing, and are listed as extirpated, endangered, threatened, or of special concern in 12 states. The State of Vermont listed the species as endangered in 1975 due to low abundances in Lake Champlain. In the late 1800s and early 1900s a small commercial fishery for sturgeon existed Lake Champlain, however current numbers are unknown and likely represent a small fraction of the historic population. Since 1998, the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife (VTFW) has conducted sampling that has documented adult spawners, eggs, and larvae in the Winooski, Lamoille, and Missisquoi rivers. Spawning adults have not been documented in Otter Creek, a historic spawning tributary of Lake Champlain. Successful reproduction is occurring in multiple rivers in the lake. In this study, we are documenting adult and juvenile movements in the lake and spawning adult movements in the Winooski River and we are working on developing a method to estimate abundance of lake sturgeon in Lake Champlain. || Lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens populations have declined throughout its range due to several factors including habitat loss and overfishing, and are listed as extirpated, endangered, threatened, or of special concern in 12 states.

In the early 2000s, a comprehensive management program (i.e., the \"Georgia Trout Management Plan\") was developed around five major categories: 1) Trout Habitat Conservation; 2) Wild Trout Management; 3) Management of Hatchery Supported Waters; 4) Hatchery Production Program; and 5) Access and Angler Use Issues. The efficacy of this plan is a question of immediate interest to fishery managers at GA Department of Natural Resources (DNR). This project is a collaboration of the Fisheries Section of GA DNR, the University of Georgia, and the Georgia Unit. A stakeholder survey was completed in 2017. A corresponding student-led paper, which included an importance-satisfaction analysis of catch and noncatch attributes, was published in 2019 in the North American Journal of Fisheries Management. Two MS students have completed degree requirements. Local, regional, and national presentations have been provided along with several interactions with GA DNR to report findings in an effort to increase socioecological information available to managers when making fisheries management decisions, such as choosing among potential future stocking scenarios. | | |[ Great Lakes Cisco spawning habitat assessment ](/coopunits/project/133182242816/matt.paufve) | December 2019 || Great Lakes Cisco, Coregonus artedi, once dominated Great Lakes forage fish communities, yet overharvest, invasive species, and habitat loss led to the widespread collapse of these native fish by the mid 1900s.

Although human plague cases in the U.S. are relatively infrequent, the disease can be fatal, and its occurrence generates considerable public concern and media attention. Sylvatic plague is relevant to the Department of Defense (DOD) as prairie dogs, ground squirrels and other susceptible rodents are present on military installations in several western states, and the occurrence of plague has curtailed military exercises in the past. Furthermore, plague still occurs in many parts of the world where troops might be deployed, and Y. pestis has the potential to be developed as a biological weapon. Arthropod-borne diseases, like plague, are thought to be particularly sensitive to local climate conditions, and expected changes in temperature and humidity over the next several decades will likely increase the eastern and northern expansion of plague outbreaks in wildlife. Through a combination of field and laboratory work, along with data-driven modeling, we will evaluate the potential effects of climate change on plague exposure pathways in prairie dogs and other rodents, and provide guidance to DOD partners regarding the potential for future outbreaks. We will also validate the use of an orally-delivered sylvatic plague vaccine (SPV) for use as a management tool to prevent outbreaks. || | | |[ Relative Population Densities of Asian Carp in the Tennessee River and Cumberland River drainages ](/coopunits/project/132414349312/mwrogers) | June 2022 || Asian carp (AC) are increasingly expanding within multiple Tennessee river systems, but knowledge of current distributions and abundance is lacking. Bighead carp have been observed in the Tennessee waters of the Cumberland River and Tennessee River for at least 10 years. Silver carp were first observed in Tennessee waters in ~2008, but they were not observed in the headwaters of the lowermost reservoirs in each river system until ~ 2012. Sporadic sampling by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency commenced in 2013 and provided some information on where AC occurred in the Tennessee River, Cumberland River, and their tributaries. All empirical and anecdotal evidence points to a rapid expansion of AC upstream in both river systems and into their tributaries and successful reproduction by silver carp in the headwaters of Kentucky Lake. Unlike other locales in the Ohio River basin, a paucity of information exists on AC in the Tennessee and Cumberland river systems. Accompanying this relative lack of information on AC in Tennessee is a deficit in our understanding of where to direct commercial fishing activity and other measures to slow the spread of AC and reduce their potential impact on native fish and mussel assemblages. The objectives of this project are to (1) assess spatial variation in relative abundance of AC in the main basins of two Tennessee River impoundments (Kentucky and Pickwick lakes) and two Cumberland River impoundments (Barkley and Cheatham lakes); (2) develop indices of AC abundance in the headwaters (i.e., dam tailwaters) of those four impoundments, which are proximal sources for further upstream invasion; (3) evaluate tailwater sampling efficiency and relate tailwater AC indices to AC catches in the main basins; and (4) sample additional tailwaters within the Tennessee and Cumberland river systems where the status of AC is unknown to further delineate the leading edge of AC in the waters of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama. || Asian carp (AC) are increasingly expanding within multiple Tennessee river systems, but knowledge of current distributions and abundance is lacking.

Partners include the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama as well as US Fish and Wildlife Service and USGS Science Centers. | | |[ Movements and Lock and Dam Passage of Asian Carp in the Tennessee River ](/coopunits/project/132414234624/mwrogers) | June 2022 || Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix are spreading in the Ohio River Basin and many of its tributaries. Increasing occurrences in one of the major tributaries, the Tennessee River, has created concerns for the five states that manage fisheries within the Tennessee River's watershed. Populations of Asian carp have become well established in the lower reaches of the Tennessee River, especially below Pickwick Dam. The leading edge of Asian Carp invasion in the Tennessee River is not well defined, but suspected to be between Pickwick Lake in Mississippi and Guntersville Lake in Alabama. Multiple agencies have begun an effort to understand the movement of Asian carp in the Tennessee River basin via acoustic telemetry. These efforts intend to inform removal efforts in downstream areas and inform invasion into the upper portions of the Tennessee River basin including the Tennessee Tombigbee waterway. There is significant potential for limiting dispersal of Asian carp at navigation locks and dams because the design of those structures limits upstream movements. Previous and ongoing studies have created an acoustic receiver array that covers much of the system. This project would fill in the gaps and complete the array of receivers on the Tennessee River system. This project joins multiple, independent projects on the system working towards a common goal. Movement data from these projects will lead to better understanding of Asian carp dispersal and invasion dynamics, evaluation of movement through lock and dam systems, and identification of seasonal congregations in the Tennessee River. The specific objectives are to (1) manually track tagged Asian carp in the Tennessee waters of the Tennessee River in 2016 and 2017; (2) quantify spatial and temporal movements of Asian Carp between Kentucky and Pickwick lakes via the lock chamber at Pickwick Dam. || Invasive Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Bighead Carp H. Nobilis are spreading in the Ohio River Basin and many of its tributaries. Increasing occurrences has created concerns for states in the Tennessee River and Cumberland River watersheds, tributaries to the Ohio River with connectivity to the Mississippi River. Upstream passage occurs through locks at dams. A multi-state effort to use telemetry to quantify lock passage is ongoing. This information will help inform potential lock management or movement barrier placement at locks. | | |[ Wolverine monitoring analysis and reporting ](/coopunits/project/131252049920/Mike.Mitchell) | June 2020 || The multi-state wolverine monitoring program will produce a large amount of data and the resulting analysis will be complex. Given the importance of the data and scrutiny that the program will receive, a thorough and rigorous analysis is important. I will lead the analysis and reporting, working closely Dr. Jake Ivan. We will analyze the wolverine camera trapping data to estimate occupancy and distribution as functions of environmental covariates and spatial autocorrelation within the pre-defined wolverine sampling frame. || Problem:<br>Wolverines are notriously difficult to monitor because they are solitary, elusive, and occur at very low densities. Some data support concerns that wolverine populations are declining, possibly affecting listing and harvest decisions.<br><br>Why the research matters:<br>No reliable monitoring methodology or collaborative infrastructure exists across the western states where wolverines live. This project will provide means by which multiple states can monitor wolverines collaboratively, allowing managers to make effective decisions for managing the wolverine population they share in common.<br><br>Collaboration:<br>Cooperators include the University of Montana, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Idaho Fish and Game, and Wyoming Game and Fish.<br><br>Informing decisions:<br>By providing estimates of wolverine abundance and distribution across multiple states this work will contribute directly to decisions critical to wolverine management, including harvest, listing as an endangered species, and multi-agency efforts to conserve wolverines across their distribution in the northern Rockies. | | |[ Rangewide Giant Kangaroo Rat Surveys & Monitoring Optimization ](/coopunits/project/130502813696/paw7002) | December 2018 || The goal of this project will be to determine the current range and status of the state- and federally-endangered Giant Kangaroo Rat (GKR). Due to the ongoing drought, and concerns over long-term permanent changes in climate within GKR habitat, there is a critical need to understand population dynamics within all GKR colonies across their range. As the five-year review in 2010, the status of GKR in many parts of its range was unknown and the most recent surveys of the satellite colonies occurred in the late 1980s. Acquiring baseline data throughout the range of GKR is necessary for long-term management and recovery of the species as well as assessing the potential impacts of development projects. || The objectives of the project are to: 1. Identify potential giant kangaroo rat habitat based on habitat models and aerial and satellite imagery 2. Document giant kangaroo rat occurrence throughout their potential range 3. Develop monitoring methods based on existing demographic data and aerial surveys of population extent. These monitoring methods will be optimized to detect changes described in the Recovery Criteria for GKR: \"During 5-year period no greater than 20 percent change in population size...\" in the Carizzo Plain, and \"stable or increasing populations for the Carrizo, Panoche, and western Kern Co. metapopulations through one precipitation cycle.\" | | |[ Demography of Black-footed and Laysan Albatross: Vital Rates in Support of the Surrogate Species Approach to Strategic Habitat Conservation ](/coopunits/project/129373782016/William.Kendall) | July 2020 || of conservation concern to the USFWS. Specifically, a petition to list the BFAL under the Endangered Species Act has recently been submitted to USFWS. Furthermore, over 65% of the world population of these albatross species nest on remote island refuges in the Pacific. Although Southern Hemisphere albatross species are well-studied, through intensive research projects conducted by multiple countries, relatively little is known about the life history, survival, breeding frequency, and reproductive success of Northern Hemisphere albatross species. Such information is important, given the variety of threats that these species face (e.g., fishery bycatch, plastics ingestions, contaminants, loss of breeding habitat due to sea level rise). A banding/recapture program to monitor the vital rates of these species, under protocols developed by the Principal Investigator and collaborators, was initiated by USFWS on Midway Atoll and Tern Island in 2004, and on Laysan Island in 2005, thus encompassing the vast majority of each of these species. Designing, developing, and maintaining this monitoring program of these globally significant populations has been an ongoing collaboration among the USGS (Patuxent Wildlife Research Center before 2010 and the Colorado Cooperative and Wildlife Research Unit since), the USGS Bird Banding Lab, the USFWS Pacific and Remote Refuges, and the USFWS Region 1 Division of Migratory Birds and Habitat Programs. The main purpose of this project is to, based on the first 10 years of this data collection, (1) to assess the life history and demographic parameters (survival, recruitment probabilities, breeding probabilities, reproductive success, variability in these metrics across populations) of these Northern Hemisphere species. The parameter estimates and variability from this effort can be incorporated into a stage-based population model, to inform status assessment and provide predictions for candidate conservation actions. (2) Review whether the level of sampling effort recommended in the monitoring protocols has produced inferences with sufficient precision for management purposes (i.e., whether effort should be increased, or could be reduced). || conservation concern to the USFWS, and a petition to list the BFAL under the Endangered Species Act has recently been submitted to USFWS. Furthermore, over 65% of the world population of these albatross species nest on remote low island refuges in the Pacific, and in smaller numbers in the main Hawaiian Islands. Relatively little is known about the life history, survival, and breeding frequency of Northern Hemisphere albatross species, and in how this compares between the low islands of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and the main Hawaiian Islands. Such information is important, given the variety of threats that these species face (e.g., fishery bycatch, plastics ingestions, contaminants, loss of breeding habitat due to sea level rise). The project is a collaboration with the USFWS Region 1 Migratory Bird and Habitat and Inventory and Monitoring programs, the Marine National Monuments of the Pacific, and the USGS Bird Banding Laboratory. A model for annual survival and breeding probability for albatross will be developed for Midway Atoll and Laysan Island, allowing these processes to be connected with threats such as overlap with long-line fishing and other environmental factors. A vetted banding database will be provided for future analyses and recommendations for future monitoring intensity will also be provided to Refuge personnel. | | |[ Productivity of American Oystercatchers nesting on spoil islands at the Cross Florida Greenway State Recreation and Conservation Area ](/coopunits/project/127299174400/nevitale) | August 2019 || Within Florida, oystercatchers are breeding at about 50 areas (managed land boundaries, DOD properties, etc.), with >90% of the population concentrated on the Gulf Coast.

The new eDNA techniques and methods will help develop a survey protocol that detects tidewater goby with higher confidence. Improved survey techniques will help Caltrans save money and avoid delays during maintenance and construction by reducing time spent in minimizing endangered species consultations to those situations where they are necessary. || California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) Districts are often required to initiate Endangered Species Act (ESA) Section 7 consultation with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), on behalf of the Federal Highway Administration, for projects that may affect the federally listed Tidewater Goby, a fish species whose current range is patchy and fragmented along the entire coastline of California. Current field survey approaches required by USFWS have relatively low detection rates for Tidewater Goby. Researchers at Humboldt State University are in the initial stages of developing an innovative approach for monitoring Tidewater Goby using eDNA techniques. This research will produce a validated eDNA protocol for use in determining the presence or absence of the Tidewater Goby at or near a project site.

We conducted controlled mesocosm experiments to quantify effects of predicted climate change on wetland biogeochemical cycles. We monitored soil organic carbon and nitrogen, nitrate (NO3-), ammonia (NH4+), and Bray-P monthly during a six-month greenhouse experiment, and subsequently conducted an incubation experiment to measure carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Soil carbon was negatively correlated with soil bulk density and positively correlated with soil moisture, but no significant trends were associated with climate treatments. Soil organic N was positively correlated with soil moisture, and NO3- was negatively correlated with bulk density. Bray-P was positively correlated with soil bulk density, but had no correlation with soil moisture. While no differences were found in the first half of the growing season, climate treatments affected soil NH4+ and NO3- after month 4. Under aerobic conditions, CO2 emissions varied for all treatments throughout 30-day incubation period, and CH4 emissions varied for all treatments after incubation day 26. Under anaerobic conditions, CO2 emissions varied during incubation days 15-17 and 20-34, CH4 varied by treatment after day 34, and N2O varied by treatment after day 27 of 62-day incubation study. Results indicate that playa hydroperiod and soil moisture impact soil C and N biogeochemical cycles to varying extents. Future climate conditions may cause shifts in playa nutrient cycles, resulting in impacts to nutrient filtration and habitat functions. | | |[ A strategic path forward for mussel conservation in the state of Missouri ](/coopunits/project/124843395072/bouskak) | July 2021 || Our overarching goal is to propose a strategic framework to guide state-level mussel conservation programs.

Working in collaboration with MDC, we will use telemetry to determine movement and habitat selection. Movement rates increased with maximum daily discharge for Spotted Bass during summer but not during other seasons. In contrast, Shorthead Redhorse movement rate was not related to maximum daily discharge in any. These results show asynchronous responses to flows for two native fish species and help to illustrate how the spatial ecology of fish is related to flow and season.

Knowledge of how species respond to fire-driven habitat changes in these landscapes is limited and generally disconnected from our understanding of adaptations that underpin responses to fire. We aimed to identify relationships between fire regime, physiographic and forest structure variables, and occupancy and functional traits of a diverse bat community, to inform forest management in a fire-prone landscape. Relationships between bat traits and fire regime were driven by adaptations to diverse forest structure. Bats adapted to foraging in open habitats and emitting longer duration and narrow bandwidth calls were associated with higher severity and more frequent fires, and bats adapted to foraging in a more cluttered environment were negatively associated with fire. Relationships between edge-adapted bat species and fire were driven by prey preference or habitat availability and configuration at a landscape scale. Predicted increases in fire frequency and severity in the western US are likely to shift dominance in the bat community to species adapted to open environments and those able to exploit post-fire resource pulses (aquatic insects, beetles, snags). Managing for pyrodiversity within the western US is likely important for maintaining bat community diversity, as well as diversity of other biotic communities. Identifying trait-fire regime relationships will help forest managers develop appropriate management interventions and focus limited resources to provide for a broad range of species. | | |[ Determine the distribution of state-endangered Longnose Darter through niche model transferability ](/coopunits/project/122754656256/colt.holley) | December 2018 || The purpose of this study is to develop an environmental niche model and determine the presence of Longnose Darter in the Poteau River system, particularly in the streams where the species has previously been documented (Poteau River and Brazil Creek) or translocated (Blackfork Creek). || The Longnose Darter is a rare fish species in Oklahoma, designated as endangered in the state .

A more detailed understanding of how environmental variables influence juvenile salmon growth rates will help inform us on how these fish will fare in a changing landscape. Objectives are to (1) characterize how juvenile Chinook and coho salmon growth rates respond to projected rising water temperatures across diverse landscape settings, and (2) examine the degree to which stream temperature monitoring sites in lower reaches are representative of upstream thermal conditions. Project results will provide support to the growing consensus that diverse habitats within a watershed support diverse early-life history opportunities for juvenile salmon and underscore the regional variability of climate change influence on Pacific salmon lifecycles. | | |[ Influence of Environmental Variables on Growth of Toxigenic Golden Alga (Prymnesium parvum): A Laboratory Test May 2020 || <i>Prymnesium parvum</i> (golden alga) is a harmful algal species that has caused serious ecological damage to inland aquatic habitats worldwide and in the USA, especially the southwest. While much field research has been conducted to characterize environmental factors associated with golden alga blooms, the information generated has been mostly descriptive and insufficient to fully understand what triggers or facilitates these blooms.

Gill nets have been used to suppress subadult and adult Lake Trout since 1995. Because survival of embryonic and larval life history stages can have profound effects on population dynamics of Lake Trout, suppression at those stages, especially if used in concert with intensive gill netting of older fish, could enhance suppression efforts. Therefore, we conducted controlled laboratory and field experiments to systematically evaluate the effects of a variety of candidate chemical (sodium chloride, calcium carbonate, gelatin, and liquid and powdered rotenone), biological (carcass and carcass analog), and physical (sediment) suppression methods on different developmental stages of Lake Trout embryos and larvae. Liquid and powdered rotenone applications, fish carcass and carcass analog exposures, and sediment deposition significantly increased embryo mortality in laboratory experiments. Sodium chloride, calcium carbonate, and gelatin applications were not effective. In-situ exposure to ground carcass material in Yellowstone Lake resulted in 100% embryo mortality in 14 and 28 kg/m2 biomass treatments; sediment deposition caused 97% embryo mortality among overwintering incubators. Embryo mortality was probably caused by hypoxic conditions within substrates. Embryo suppression methods differed in their effectiveness, rate at which mortality was achieved, and ease of application. These differences, as well as Lake Trout spawning site characteristics such as depth, contour, fetch, substrate size, interstitial depth, isolation, and presence of non-target organisms ultimately determine which embryo suppression method will be most applicable in a given situation. Nevertheless, implementation of successful embryo suppression techniques evaluated in this study could be used to increase mortality of Lake Trout in Yellowstone Lake. Incorporating effective embryo suppression in an Integrated Pest Management approach has the potential to provide more effective Lake Trout suppression in the long term. || Introductions of nonnative lake trout into lakes of the northwestern United States have often posed serious threats to native fish assemblages because lake trout are keystone predators that directly or indirectly affect all other sympatric fishes as well as other taxa. Currently, intensive gillnetting is the primary method of lake trout suppression used by fisheries managers, but development of alternative suppression methods to be used in concert with intensive gillnetting is highly desired. Suppression methods that target lake trout embryos and larvae in spawning substrates have not been investigated extensively. Along with our NPS and USFWS partners, we conducted controlled laboratory and field experiments to systematically evaluate the effects of a variety of candidate chemical (sodium chloride, calcium carbonate, gelatin, and liquid and powdered rotenone), biological (carcass and carcass analog), and physical (sediment) suppression methods on different developmental stages of Lake Trout embryos and larvae.

Through interactions with neural, endocrine, and immune systems, endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) can influence growth, development, reproduction, disease, and mortality, with adverse outcomes for populations, communities, and ecosystems. Within the Chesapeake Bay, understanding the effects of EDCs on fish and wildlife populations has been identified as a priority to help inform natural resource management. Specifically, there is a need for assessing the risk of EDCs to fish and wildlife populations and their health. The risk assessment will integrate our understanding of the (1) population dynamics of the fish or wildlife species of interest, (2) mechanisms through which EDCs interact with individuals, and (3) exposure pathways between sources of EDCs, including hydrological conditions and land use practices, and fish and wildlife populations. This will help identify short and long-term impacts of compounds or classes of chemicals of concern, potential environmental conditions and stressors that may mediate the effects of EDCs, and how land use management practices may reduce exposure to EDCs. || | | |[ Using Genomics to Understand Population Dynamics and Enhance the Management of Canada Lynx Populations in the Contiguous United States ](/coopunits/project/115448346624/tanya_lama) | December 2019 || Management of Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) populations occurring at the edge of the species range has been informed by limited regional studies mostly focused on demographics and ecology.

In the last two decades, the bear population in the state has been growing due to conservative bear management and increasing anthropogenic resources. Successful management of the population requires estimating population and home range sizes, and understanding patterns of resources selection and population density in relation to landcover. New York covers approximately 141,000 km2, and so, to collect spatially representative data for such a large region, we must consider approaches to sampling that supplement intensive, traditional capture-recapture and occupancy methods. Such an addition could utilize citizen science, which engages a disperse but wide-ranging network of the public in the scientific research process, often through assistance with data collection. Citizen science has a long and successful history in monitoring natural systems over large spatial and temporal ranges, and recent advances in technology and computation have made the large quantity and variable quality of citizen science data more tractable. We describe a conceptual framework for joining non-invasive citizen science efforts with telemetry, spatial capture recapture, and occupancy methods into a single integrated population model for managing black bears. This integrated approach would be valuable for identifying patterns of black bear distribution, resource selections and movement across a range of spatial scales, for gaining a more mechanistic understanding of black bear population dynamics, and for helping to develop a comprehensive management plan for black bears in New York. || Since its first description in the 1950s, the black bear population in New York has been growing. Particularly, the Southern Black Bear Range, with approximately 2,000 bears, has been expanding northwards into central New York. We are developing a non-harvest based spatial estimate of population size, density, and demographic rates of black bears in the Southern Black Bear Range, as harvest-based indices may not track true changes in the population. This work will inform bear management and help to understand and anticipate the spatial patterns of black bear range expansion in New York. We are developing an integrated population model that uses different datasets collected from the same population to more precisely and accurately estimate population parameters of ecological interest, including population size, distribution, and rates such as population growth, survival, and recruitment. The integrated population model will accommodate noninvasive spatial capture-recapture, camera trapping, radiotelemetry, citizen science, and harvest and hunter surveys. We launched a citizen science project called iSeeMammals that collects presence-absence data from hikes and trail cameras submitted by the public. The app is compatible with Apple and Android smartphones. Multimedia outreach efforts, including workshops, lectures, interviews, and press releases were conducted to advertise the project. The website and smartphone app was launched in early spring, and by October 2017, a total of 712 users from across New York had signed up. iSeeMammals data contributed an additional 406 independent sets of spatial locations, increasing the spatial and temporal extent of data collection. iSeeMammals will continue to collect data, which will be used in the integrated population model to estimate population parameters. | | |[ Density estimation of moose in New York State: investigations into the apparent decline ](/coopunits/project/115442696192/aw685) | August 2019 || This project will investigate the apparent declines in the moose population within New York. We will implement a spatial capture- recapture (SCR) study of moose in New York to estimate population density. This method will employ scat detection dogs to survey moose scat, which will then be used to genetically identify individuals. The SCR models that are developed will be used to study processes such as resource selection, movement, space usage, and landscape connectivity, contributing to moose management by providing inference on the impacts of land-use patterns, climate, disease, and interspecific interactions on population processes. We will make recommendations regarding efficient survey designs that incorporate both occupancy-level survey data (possibly including remotely-operated trail cameras, observations from hunter surveys, etc.) and non-invasive genetic sampling so that rigorous range-wide surveys can be conducted to estimate abundance and density. The project, in collaboration with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and The Wildlife Conservation Society, will also focus on developing broader management and population goals for moose in New York, including the characterization of stakeholder concerns for population-level thresholds. || The recolonization of moose in the Northeast U.S. has seen generally steady growth in most states following extirpation from their range in the 1860s due to unregulated hunting and forest loss. Moose expanded back into their former range from populations in Maine in 1950, and eventually returned to New York in the 1980s. Current population estimates suggest that the New York population has not seen the same rate of increase as the rest of the Northeast states, with estimates of moose abundance ranging from 500-1,000 individuals (for comparison, neighboring Vermont has an estimated 3,000-4,000 moose). This study aims to provide an estimate of moose abundance in New York State through spatial capture-recapture and noninvasive genetics. Within the Adirondack Park, we utilized scat detection dogs to detect moose feces along 70 3km transects in various habitats and management regimes. In theory, the identity of each individual moose can be determined from DNA in epithelial cells on the surface of the feces. The spatial capture-recapture method can subsequently provide estimates of local density. The models will include covariates on moose density including deer density, habitat type, forage availability, canopy cover, human activity, and topography, which are expected to help predict moose density. From these models we can also infer which of the hypothesized effects have the strongest relationship with moose distribution and density. Due to the low encounter frequency of moose in the park using our methods in 2016, we developed an adaptive method of sampling under the SCR analytical framework. In brief, our method allows us to apply SCR sampling at only sites that are likely to provide samples during the season, and avoid sites without evidence of moose at the site. Simulation study shows that this method is at least as accurate & precise as ordinary SCR, but with approximately 50% of the effort. Implementation of this method in 2017 resulted in the four-fold increase in sample collections that we observed. | | |[ Increasing parameter accuracy of an agriculturally focused, spatially-explicit bee abundance model ](/coopunits/project/115417374720/brianne.looze) | May 2019 || The increasing risk of relying on honeybees for crop pollination has led to growing interest in native bees as a potential alternative to ensure successful production.

The broader objectives are to: 1. Assess what hunters and other waterfowl conservationists (i.e., members of organizations supporting migratory bird conservation including viewers) most desire from their natural resource based management and social settings to inform NAWMP objectives and select habitat and population management alternatives. 2. Establish baseline measures that can be repeated to inform the development of a Public Engagement Strategy and monitor trends in achieving the NAWMP goal of \"growing numbers of waterfowl hunters, other conservationists, and citizens who enjoy and actively support waterfowl and wetlands conservation.\" 3. Assess waterfowl hunters' knowledge, preferences, levels of use, and support for waterfowl and wetlands conservation. 4. Assess other waterfowl conservationists' knowledge, preferences, levels of use and support for waterfowl and wetlands conservation. 5. Assess the general publics' awareness and their perceptions regarding the importance of the benefits and values (i.e., Ecological Goods and Services - EGS) provided by waterfowl and wetlands conservation. 6. Assess the general publics' participation in waterfowl-associated recreation and how much they support waterfowl and wetlands conservation. 7. Assess waterfowl professionals' perspectives on the levels of waterfowl populations and habitats needed to support hunter and viewer use opportunities. In summary, two continental U.S.-wide surveys will be conducted with waterfowl hunters and other waterfowl recreationists. The proposed research will be conducted in coordination with other research conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey's Fort Collins Science Center and by researchers in Canada. Expected outcomes: 1) Quantified waterfowl management professionals' preferences regarding the desired future states relative to the three goals of NAWMP. 2) Quantified stakeholder preferences regarding what they desire in regards to their recreational experiences (hunting and viewing). 3) Foundations to develop explicit and transparent population, habitat, and people objectives (or at least define the tradeoffs) based on the quantified expressed preferences of waterfowl management professionals and stakeholders. 4) Foundations to select management alternatives that are most responsive to stakeholder desires and most likely to help achieve NAWMP objectives relating to people. 5) Segmentation of stakeholder groups based on types of participation (e.g., viewing and/or hunting), geographic location, engagement in conservation, knowledge of waterfowl and/or ecological goods and services of waterfowl habitats, and demographic characteristics. 6) Quantification of the general public's participation in waterfowl and wetlands based activities, their awareness and perceptions of ecological goods and services and their evaluation of the || Managing waterfowl and the wetlands that sustain is a fundamental management challenge in North American.

In so doing we will evaluate the proximity of 3 key sheep herds to NCC, and elucidate the interactions among density dependence, nutrition condition, chronic stress, demography, and disease susceptibility. Achieving these key objectives will aid in understanding how herd density, environmental conditions, and harvest management interact to affect proximity of populations to NCC and their susceptibility to pneumonia. Notably, our objectives correspond directly to needs outlined in The Wyoming Plan by the State-wide Bighorn/Sheep Domestic Sheep Interaction Working Group (2004). Specifically, that group expressed needs to monitor habitat selection and habitat NCC, evaluate if poor nutrition contributes to disease susceptibility, and determine if habitat improvements influence nutritional status of populations and thus influence NCC. In addition, the group indicated that knowledge of carrying capacity was necessary to ensure sheep do not exceed the capacity of their habitat, and that understanding how habitat improvements modify nutrition and subsequently influence performance is necessary for sound management. || | | |[ Deer-Elk Ecology Project (DEER PRoject) ](/coopunits/project/115331057664/mhayes1) | July 2020 || Mule deer are an integral part of the outdoor heritage of western North America, a relished species of pursuit among big-game hunters throughout the country, and a key component of the landscape of the West. Nevertheless, mule deer populations have declined across much of their range during the last 2 decades, with a number of factors potentially contributing to those declines. Coincident with waning populations of mule deer, populations of elk have burgeoned throughout much of their range through growth in abundance and range expansion. The opposite trajectories of these two species that overlap throughout much of their range have spawned the hypothesis that competition between elk and mule deer may contribute to declining mule deer populations. Quantifying the net effects of competition on nutritional condition, survival, productivity, and ultimately population growth is a difficult endeavor and one that has not been adequately addressed. To better understand factors regulating growth of struggling mule deer populations, and identifying what, if any, effect elk have on mule deer is key to knowing what management and conservation actions will enhance mule deer populations, while maintaining robust elk populations in the future. In few places are these questions more prevalent than for the south Rock Springs mule deer and elk herds in southwest Wyoming. This region harbors some of the most sought mule deer and elk hunting in the state of Wyoming. While elk have been above desired levels during most of the last 2 decades, the mule deer population remains about half of the desired population level. In an effort to address the underlying reasons for failed growth of this and other mule deer populations in the West, a non-profit organization, a management agency, and a research entity have formed a key partnership to conceive and execute the Deer-Elk Ecology Research (DEER) Project. || | | |[ Fawn Survival - WY Range Mule Deer ](/coopunits/project/115330961408/sdwinnel) | July 2019 || In March 2013, the Wyoming Range Mule Deer Project commenced, with the overall goal to address important research and management needs identified by the Mule Deer Working Group in the Wyoming Mule Deer Initiative and the herd-specific Wyoming Range Mule Deer Initiative. Broadly, this project is investigating the nutritional relationships between mule deer population dynamics, energy development and disturbance, habitat conditions, and climate to provide a mechanistic approach to monitoring and management of mule deer. This project is the top research priority for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department and has received considerable support from numerous partners; because of that support, this 630K project is within 30K of being fully funded. Also, given the intensity of the monitoring that is taking place to meet project objectives, we have a unique opportunity to more fully address complex questions, such as quantifying the effects of predation on fawn survival--a study objective that is often cost-prohibitive to achieve or to measure properly. Indeed, adding a fawn survival component to the Wyoming Range Mule Deer Project was discussed at length during the Projects inception, but was deemed too costly to pursue at the time. A study examining survival and cause-specific mortality of a Wyoming ungulate is unprecedented and would be a valuable addition to the Wyoming Range Mule Deer Project. Moreover, the relative roles of habitat and predation on dynamics of mule deer populations were key topics discussed during the public input process of the Wyoming Mule Deer Initiative, and knowing their relative contributions will aid in formulating strategies to enhance population growth. Our efforts here will add a Fawn Survival Project to the Wyoming Range Mule Deer Project to address directly, the contributions of predation, habitat, and nutrition to fawn survival and deer population dynamics. || | | |[ Harvest Records: implications for understanding factors affecting horn and antler size in ungulates ](/coopunits/project/115330754560/tlasharr) | June 2019 || Our overall goal is to provide a rigorous evaluation of two sources of harvest data to document long-term trends in horn size and age of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), Dall's sheep dalli stonei) at a regional level, and to quantify the general relevance of trophy records recorded by conservation organizations. For the first analysis, we will seek to collaborate with state and provincial agencies throughout western North America to evaluate records for bighorn and thinhorn sheep collected by biologists. All harvested bighorn and thinhorn sheep are required to be inspected and have their horns permanently marked with a small identification plug. Because those ungulates can be aged via horn annuli, most western agencies employ a program to record size and age of all harvested sheep. Agency harvest records for sheep represent a valuable resource to assess trends in size and factors responsible for those patterns on a more regional basis, and thus, to also provide a more robust test of hypotheses and effects of specific management practices. For our second analysis, our data source will include trophy specimens recorded in the Pope and Young Records Program, which includes nearly all native, North American ungulates. Similar to the Boone and Crockett Club, the Pope and Young Club (founded as a nonprofit organization in 1961) adopted the same, universally accepted scoring system for collecting and recording information on horn and antler size of trophy big game harvested with archery equipment in North America. Minimum entry requirements for the Pope and Young Club however, are markedly lower than Boone and Crockett minimum scores. Therefore, data from the Pope and Young Records Program contain males of smaller size, and thus younger age classes, and the sample size is more than double that recorded by the Boone and Crockett Club. || | | |[ Wild juvenile salmonid abundance and outmigration in Wisconsin tributaries to Lake Michigan ](/coopunits/project/115323654144/Eric.Wegleitner) | December 2018 || Introduced salmonids (i.e., chinook and Coho salmon, rainbow and brown trout) support important recreational fisheries within the Lake Michigan ecosystem. These fisheries are primarily supported by stocking. However, some natural reproduction is known to occur within some tributary systems. Specifically, anadromous rainbow trout (i.e., steelhead) stocked into Lake Michigan are known to exhibit an adfluvial life history, migrating up tributaries for spawning. Wild offspring have been encountered in some of these tributaries, but it is not known whether these fish successfully outmigrate from these streams into larger tributaries or Lake Michigan. The primary objectives of our research are to determine if: 1) abundance of wild age-0 salmonids (primarily steelhead) varies among selected streams in relation to available habitat; 2) wild age-0 salmonids successfully outmigrate from Wisconsin tributaries into Lake Michigan or into larger tributaries and 3) potential bottlenecks related to stream temperature or annual flow regimes prevent successful outmigration from some streams. We will also compare mark-recapture methods used to estimate wild age-0 salmonid abundance to determine if a single sampling event following stocking of marked fish yields similar estimates to estimates derived from multiple sampling events. || While salmon fishing is popular in the open waters of Lake Michigan, the majority of anglers specifically targeting steelhead, fish in the tributaries of Lake Michigan. Management and research related to steelhead should focus on identifying the sources of fish that support these tributary fisheries. This research was a collaboration with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Relative to the total numbers of fish stocked and wild age-0 abundance in Michigan tributaries, the contribution of wild juvenile steelhead and Coho Salmon from Wisconsin tributaries to adult populations in Lake Michigan is likely minimal. Return of wild steelhead produced in these streams is probably insufficient to maintain fisheries within these streams. | | |[ Integrated Forest Ecosystem Assessment to Support Sustainable Management Decisions in a Changing Climate ](/coopunits/project/115284553728/schuyler) | September 2019 || Since the 1970's, temperatures across the northeastern US have warmed 0.25 degrees Celsius per decade, which has been accompanied by a wide range of biological changes (Hayhoe et al., 2006). Climate change will continue to restructure forests over the coming century, although the details remain uncertain. To refine our understanding of how climate may impact forested ecosystems, this project examines the role of climate in forest ecosystem health and function through a combination of monitoring, experimental and modeling activities. The wildlife component of the project will focus on modeling wildlife distribution of ten key species, including white-tailed deer, American black bear, and moose, under current forest and landscape conditions. Projections of wildlife distribution in the year 2050 will be made in partnership with Harvard Forest's New England Landscape Future's Project -- a community of scientists, business owners, government officials, landowners and non-profit representatives who have developed and analyzed a set of alternative landscape futures (or, \"scenarios\") for New England and comparing them to \"business as usual.\" The resulting maps of current and projected wildlife distribution will be incorporated into a spatial structured decision framework. This framework will allow land managers to compare the probability of management activity success on a pixel by pixel basis, reflecting the complexity of the Northeast's heterogeneous landscape. This is a large, collaborative effort with many collaborators and graduate students. The wildlife portion of this study is directed by James Murdoch and Therese Donovan, who mentor PhD student Skye Pearman-Gillman. || Since the 1970's, temperatures across the northeastern US have warmed 0.25 degrees Celsius per decade, which has been accompanied by a wide range of biological changes.

In its simplest form, a population can gain numbers through the processes of birth or immigration, and can lose numbers through death or emigration. In more complex forms, these numbers are shaped by a myriad of factors. Management of some species includes a regulated harvest season, where hunters are permitted to harvest animals according to set of regulations and thereby contribute to the population's total deaths. When managing a harvested species, a critical challenge is predicting how the wild population will respond to both the harvest and to other environmental factors. If the harvest is too great, the population may decline. And if the harvest is too little, the population may increase to the point of disrupting ecosystem structure and function. Thus, managing the harvest is delicate balancing act. Most state agencies collect data on the age, sex, and number of harvested animals on an annual basis. Fortunately, the data associated with the harvested (dead) animals can provide a glimpse into the status of the living population, making these tasks more tractable. As Gove et al. (2002) suggest, \"Intriguingly nested within the age-at-harvest data is information on age and sex composition, survival, and fecundity rates.\" Because of this, and because of the tremendous effort spent in collecting harvest information across agencies and through time, harvest datasets are among the richest datasets in North America for analyzing the population size, trend, and health of wildlife populations. Agencies are called to implement their harvest programs within an adaptive management (AM) framework. The process generally involves identifying the natural resource management problem, setting management objectives, identifying potential alternative management actions, estimating the likely consequences of each alternative, and then weighing each alternative and identifying trade-offs among alternatives. \"Adaptive management\" is the application of such approaches when a decision problem is iterative, such that new information can be incorporated into decision making. While a significant amount has been written about the process of adaptive management, in practice it can be difficult to understand how to implement an adaptive management program that seamlessly integrates data collection, models, decision making, analysis, and outputs. To aid this process, the Vermont Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit is developing a suite of R packages called AMHarvest, AMPop, and AMModels that facilitate adaptive management in practice. R is an open source modeling platform that can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Network website. The first package, AMModels, has been released on R, and is the linchpin for storing data (inputs) and models (outputs) from an adaptive management program. Work on the AMPop and AMHarvest are ongoing. || Problem statement: Agencies are called to implement their harvest programs within an adaptive management (AM) framework.

This outbreak was likely caused by pathogens transmitted from domestic sheep or goats to which native bighorn sheep mostly lack natural resistance, and could lead to extirpation of the iconic species from the Preserve. MOJA and adjacent mountain ranges support a large meta-population of desert bighorn sheep, central to the most extensive array of naturally-persisting bighorn herds in North America. Until 2013, pneumonia epizootics in this region were unknown. This study is using both existing and new data to evaluate adult and juvenile survival over multiple years across populations where pneumonia is present, to establish the demographic consequences of the current disease outbreak, and determine how strong environmental stochasticity affects the persistence and impacts of the disease. We will also use recently updated genetic data and studies of seasonal movement patterns by male and female bighorn sheep to infer risk of disease spread among populations. || A recently discovered (May 2013) outbreak of epizootic pneumonia in the deserts of southeastern California caused a substantial die-off of desert bighorn sheep in the largest and most important population in the Mojave National Preserve (MOJA).

Neonicotinoids are systemic insecticides widely used as pre-planting treatments on crop seeds to control insect agricultural pests. Neonicotinoids are a derivative of nicotine with a mode of action that binds more tightly with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in the central nervous system of insects, compared to vertebrates (Morrissey et al. 2015). Consequently, neonicotinoids are selectively more toxic to invertebrates than vertebrates (Tomizawa and Casida 2005). Neonicotinoids were developed and registered in the early 1990s and have been widely adopted for agricultural use throughout North America and Europe, in large part because of their low toxicity to vertebrates, high toxicity to insects, flexible use, and systemic nature (Morrissey et al 2015, Goulson 2013, Kollmeyer et al. 1999, Tomozawa and Casida 2005). Imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam are three of the most commonly used active ingredients in neonicotinoid-formulated insecticides. Neonicotinoid insecticides can be applied using a number of different methods including application as a drench, with irrigation water, as a foliar spray, as seed coatings or injected in soil or trees. They are most commonly used as pre-planting seed treatments to provide early season protection for corn and soybeans as well as a number of other agricultural crops, fruits, and vegetables; imidacloprid is also widely used in lawn and garden products as well as topical flea applications (Hladik et al. 2014). Neonicotinoids are systemic chemicals, meaning the active ingredient is translocated throughout a growing plant, transforming all parts of the plant toxic to insects that feed on the plant (Syngenta 2011). A benefit of neonicotinoids is that application rates are low and precise; when applied as a seed dressing, rates typically range from 0.25 to 1.25 mg active ingredient (ai)/seed. However, because these chemicals are systemic, all parts of a treated plant, including nectar and pollen, receive some dose of insecticide which increases the potential of adverse effects on non-target insects. The primary targets of neonicotinoid seed treatments are agricultural pests that feed on crop plants through chewing or sucking methods; however, all three chemicals have been implicated in honey bee deaths whereby the bees have contacted contaminated pollen, ingested contaminated guttation or been exposed to contaminated dust generated during planting activities (Krupke et al. 2012, Mason et al. 2013). Imidacloprid, when applied experimentally in field realistic doses, has been linked to reduced colony growth and queen performance in bumblebees (Feltham et al. 2014, Whitehorn et al. 2012). Similarly, Sandrock et al. (2013) found sub-lethal exposure of a solitary bee species to clothianidin and thiamethoxam in controlled experimental populations reduced reproductive output and resulted in male-biased offspring. Bees other than honey-bees may face additional hazards in an agriculture setting as they tend to have smaller foraging areas which results in fewer food choices (Pisa et al. 2014). Ground-nesting species of bees also face potential exposure to pesticides in soil and, as they tend to be smaller-sized, may experience effects at different concentrations than larger-bodied bees (Pisa et al. 2014). These and other concerns regarding potential detrimental effects on bee populations, specifically, and pollinator populations, in general, resulted in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issuing new label requirements for insecticides containing neonicotinoids and re-opening the registration review dockets on all neonicotinoid pesticides with the reviews projected to be completed by 2018-2019 (EPA 2015). Another emerging issue related to neonicotinoids is persistence and accumulation in the soil and consequences to soil organisms such as earthworms that may be in direct contact with or ingest the chemicals (Dittbrenner et al 2010, Wang et al. 2012). Neonicotinoids are persistent in the environment, with reported half-lives ranging from 200 to >1000 days and since >90% of active ingredients found in neonicotinoids applied as seed treatments enter the soil, repeated application has the potential to accumulate high concentrations in soils (Goulson 2013, Jones et al. 2014). Jones et al. (2014) conducted a preliminary investigation to determine if imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam could be detected in cropfields and crop margins in eastern England that had not been planted for up to three years prior to their investigation. Total detected neonicotinoid concentrations were greater in the center of the tested fields, ranging from 0.51-16.4 \u00b5g/kg than the edges of the fields, which ranged from 0.04-7.4 \u00b5g/kg. They detected clothianindin in a field that had not been treated with clothianindin or thiamethoxam (clothianindin is a metabolite of thiamethoxam) for 2.5 years, and clothianindin in one field and thiamethoxam in seven fields which had not had these chemicals applied for three years. Imidacloprid was detected in 15 of 18 fields sampled even though this chemical had only been used in two of the fields three years prior to their study. De Perre et al. (2015) also found clothianindin to be persistent in the soil and that accumulation occurred with repeated plantings; however, the concentrations they detected in fields planted with application rates of 0.25 mg ai/seed and 0.50 mg ai/seed did not pose an acute risk to the species used in their study. It is uncertain how long neonicotinoids persist in the environment once direct application ceases as degradation is influenced by multiple factors such as differences in application rates, pH, temperature, soil type, and organic content (Morrissey et al 2015). It is also uncertain if plants that subsequently are planted to or invade a site with neonicotinoid soil accumulation will take up the chemicals. De Perre et al. (2015) speculated that reduced concentrations of clothianindin in runoff water samples after approximately 30 days were a result of the chemical binding with soil particles, thus making it less available for leaching. This would seem to reduce the likelihood of uptake by other plants. The influence of neonicotinoids on soil fauna is equally uncertain, particularly in terms of lethal and sub-lethal effects and potential trophic cascading effects. Earthworms play key roles in soils and, as part of the ecosystem services they perform, contribute toward breakdown of organic matter, soil fertility, soil aeration and drainage (Edwards and Bohlen 1992, Duiker and Stehouwer 2008). Earthworms are viewed as excellent candidates to assay soil health due to their ecological importance, high biomass in soil, and sensitivity to relatively low concentrations of contaminants (Dittbrenner et al. 2010). Although Eisenia fetida is the recommended test species by the International Standardization Organization (ISO), it is an epigeic, or litter-dwelling, earthworm rarely associated with agriculture and is considered to be more tolerant of contaminants than other earthworm species (Dittbrenner et al. 2010). Nevertheless, Wang et al. (2012) found five neonicotinoids, both in contact and artificial soil tests, to be highly toxic to E. fetida. Dittbrenner et al. (2011) assessed the effects of imidacloprid Lumbricus terrestris, an an endogeic, or shallow-dwelling, species of earthworms more closely associated with agricultural fields. They found adverse effects of imidacloprid on the burrowing activities of both species in environmentally relevant concentrations for short- and long-term laboratory experiments. Similarly, Dittbrenner et al (2010) reported sub-lethal effects on L. terrestris and A. caliginosa when using changes in body mass and cast production to evaluate the effects of imidacloprid at environmentally relevant concentrations in a laboratory setting. Sub-lethal effects on soil organisms exposed to neonicotinoids raise questions regarding trophic interactions, as predators consume prey that may have bio-accumulated the chemicals. Douglas et al. (2014) detected a trophic transfer of neonicotinoids in which slugs, a molluscan agricultural pest, were tolerant to thiamethoxam but the predaceous beetles that fed on the slugs were sensitive to the chemical. They noted depressed activity by the predaceous beetles after feeding on contaminated slugs, increased damage to soybeans by slugs as the population was released from predation pressure, and overall reduction in soybean yield (Douglas et al. 2014). Hallmann et al. (2014) recently reported a negative correlation between local population trends of insectivorous birds and neonicotinoid concentrations in surface waters, and attributed the relationship to cascading trophic effects of neonicotinoids to aquatic food chains. Currently, the vast majority of corn seed planted in the Midwest is treated with either clothianidin or thiamethoxam while soybean seeds are more often treated with thiamethoxam (Krupke et al. 2012). The Department of Conservation plants approximately 67,000 acres of agricultural crop annually on Department areas. In 2013, almost 15,000 acres were planted to corn and 23,000 acres to soybeans. These agricultural operations on Department lands are used for optimal production of wildlife food and cover with use of accepted best farm management practices, and are managed to provide the best economic return consistent with resource management objectives. An important and vital aspect of the Department's mission is to protect and manage the forest, fish and wildlife resources of the state (MDC 2014). Given the high use of neonicotinoid insecticides as a pre-planting treatment of corn and soybean seeds in the Midwest and their inherent characteristics, i.e., acute toxicity to insects, relatively long half- lives in soil, and high water solubility combined with the potential for them to pass through trophic levels via food webs, their use may be in conflict with the Department's efforts to sustain healthy forests, fish, and wildlife if concentrations are present at lethal or sub-lethal levels to non-target taxa. It is, therefore, imperative to determine the concentrations and persistence of these chemicals on Department public areas in regards to upland agricultural plantings, associated cropfield borders, and within the soil and, depending on the outcomes of this investigation, recommend best management practices to reduce potential deleterious effects on non-target taxa. || Unlike honeybees, numerous wild bee species nest belowground and in close proximity to cultivated fields and adjacent flowering field-margins. Although agricultural field-margins can serve as important bee foraging habitat, these areas may also accumulate neonicotinoid insecticides via runoff events and planter dust. Few field studies have evaluated neonicotinoid impacts on wild pollinator communities, including solitary, ground-nesting bees (e.g., sweat bees, longhorn bees). To assess effects of neonicotinoid exposure on native bee floral (diet specialization) and nesting guilds (e.g., soil, cavity), we sampled 30 soybean fields on five conservation areas in north-central Missouri from pre-seeding through harvest in 2017. Following baseline data collection in 2016, soybean fields were cultivated using one of three treatments: imidacloprid-treated fields (n=10); untreated fields (n=10); and previously treated (2016) to untreated fields (n=10). At each site, we collected field and field-margin soils, flower heads from wildflowers and soybean plants, and native pollinators every 28 days over five sampling periods (pre-seeding, post-seeding, growing, soybean flowering, and harvest). Neonicotinoid residues were detected in field soils during all sampling periods (frequency: pre-seeding, 7%; post-seeding, 33%; However, neonicotinoids were infrequently detected in margin soils (<8% frequency, overall) with no residues detected in flowers from field-margin or soybean plants. Overall, wild bee abundance was significantly less in fields with greater neonicotinoid concentrations ( = -0.27 \u00b1 0.09, P = 0.003) though this relationship became slightly positive over time ( = 0.08 \u00b1 0.02, P = <0.001). Soil-nesting bee richness was significantly greater in margins surrounding untreated fields compared to previously treated fields. Additionally, fewer floral diet specialist bees were collected in field-margins surrounding fields with greater soil concentrations. Our research findings can improve our understanding of neonicotinoid seed-treatment use on non-target native pollinator communities within agroecosystems. | | |[ Prevalence of neonicotinoid insecticides on MDC intensively managed wetland areas and surrounding landscapes with a focus on impacts to aquatic invertebrates ](/coopunits/project/115039268864/kjk6x2) | June 2019 || Neonicotinoids are a relatively new class of chemical insecticide widely used as pre-planting treatments on crop seeds to control insect agricultural pests. Recent concerns regarding the potential acute and chronic effects of these chemicals on bees and aquatic invertebrates have resulted in restrictions on their use in both Europe and Canada. In the United States, the EPA is currently reviewing the registered uses of these products. In addition to toxicity concerns regarding non-target species, these chemicals are relatively water soluble and persistent in soil, raising alarm about contamination of surface waters in the vicinity of their use (Goulson 2013). A recent study in the prairie pothole region of Canada (Main et al. 2014) revealed widespread occurrence of these insecticides in wetlands at water concentrations shown to be toxic to aquatic invertebrates in the laboratory. Given the emerging evidence for potential harm neonicotinoids have on multiple taxa, the immediate issue for MDC is to determine if use of neonicotinoid-treated seeds in association with agricultural activities on MDC properties result in concentrations of these insecticides in MDC wetlands at levels that result in ecological impairment, particularly to aquatic invertebrates. A related issue is the prevalence of neonicotinoids in the surrounding landscape and water sources and whether this results in concentrations on MDC properties that have detrimental effects to aquatic invertebrates. Neonicotinoids are systemic insecticides that translocate an active ingredient throughout a growing plant and act on the nervous system of insects that feed on the plant (Syngenta 2011). Neonicotinoids were developed in the 1980s and have been widely adopted for agricultural use throughout North America and Europe, in large part because they are selectively more toxic to insects than vertebrates (Kollmeyer et al. 1999, Tomozawa and Casida 2005). Active thiamethoxam, used as seed treatments for corn and soybeans as well as a number of other agricultural crops, fruits, and vegetables, are three of the most commonly used active ingredients; imidacloprid is also widely used in lawn and garden products as well as topical flea applications (Hladik et al. 2014). Use of neonicotinoids has increased considerably since 2000 due to their low toxicity to vertebrates, high toxicity to insects, flexible use, and systemic activity (Goulson 2013). Currently, the vast majority of corn seed planted in the Midwest is treated with either clothianidin or thiamethoxam while soybean seeds are treated with thiamethoxam (Krupke et al. 2012). All three have been implicated in honey bee deaths (Krupke et al. 2012, Mason et al. 2013) while imidacloprid has been linked to reduced colony growth and queen performance in bumble bees (Whitehorn et al. 2012). This has raised concerns about potential detrimental effects on bee populations, specifically, and pollinator populations, in general. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), although not currently banning or restricting the use of the neonicotinoid pesticides, is conducting a registration review on imidacloprid due to uncertainty regarding potential chronic effects on pollinators as well as other taxa including avian species, small mammals, and aquatic invertebrates (EPA 2008). A benefit of neonicotinoids is that application rates are low and precise; when applied as a seed dressing, rates typically range from 0.25 to 1.25 mg a.i./seed. However, >90% of active ingredients found in neonicotinoids applied as seed treatments enter the soil, where half-life can range from 200 to >1000 days (Goulson 2013). Given the relatively long half-life and high degree of water solubility of many neonicotinoids, repeated application has the potential to accumulate high concentrations in soils, which can then leach to groundwater or surface water following precipitation events (Gupta et al. 2008, Starner and Goh 2012). Recently, neonicotinoids were detected in >90% of wetlands sampled within the prairie pothole region of Saskatchewan (Main et al. 2014), while Hladik et al. (2014) reported neonicotinoid occurrence in all Midwestern streams sampled, many with concentrations exceeding acute and chronic exposure levels for aquatic macroinvertebrates. Neonicotinoids are highly toxic to aquatic invertebrates (Bayer CropScience 2010, Syngenta 2006), which are a major source of protein for many wetland dependent species, particularly migratory water birds (Rundle and Sayre 1983, Krapu and Reinecke 1992, Skagen and Oman 1996, Davis and Smith 1998). Beketov et al. (2008) demonstrated that a single pulse application of the neonicotinoid thiacloprid altered long-term community structure of stream macroinvertebrates in a mesocosm, with populations of longer-lived species less likely to recover. A study in the Netherlands reported a significant negative correlation between imidacloprid concentrations in surface waters and macroinvertebrate abundance, including orders Diptera and Ephemeroptera, which commonly occur in wetland ecosystems ((Van Dijk et al. 2013). However, this study relied on disparate, previously collected data, where invertebrate and neonicotinoid samples were collected in different locations (up to 1 km apart) and times (up to 160 days apart) (Van Dijk et al. 2013) Prolonged exposure in water to the neonicotinoid imidacloprid was linked to changes in growth, persistence and community composition of aquatic invertebrates, particularly to individuals in the functional group known as shredders, potentially reducing ecosystem functions related to decomposition, nutrient cycling and water quality (Kreutzweiser et al. 2009, Agatz et al. 2014, Chagnon et al. 2014). Additionally neonicotinoids are speculated to have indirect effects on wetland ecosystems through the ability to alter the base of aquatic food webs and reduce availability of important invertebrate prey for wetland dependent taxa (Chagnon et al. 2014). In a mesocosm experiment, annual application of two systemic insecticides, imidacloprid and fipronil, reduced benthic arthropod prey, and led to a reduction in fish growth rates (Hayasaka et al. 2012). Several recent studies have speculated that declines of many insectivorous bird species are linked to high application rates of neonicotinoids in the surrounding landscape and subsequent reductions to invertebrate prey base (Mason et al. 2013). Indeed, Hallmann et al. (2014) recently reported a negative correlation between local population trends of insectivorous birds and neonicotinoid concentrations in surface waters, and attributed the relationship to cascading trophic effects of neonicotinoids to aquatic food chains. Given the high use of neonicotinoid insecticides as a pre-planting treatment of corn and soybean seeds in the Midwest and their inherent characteristics, i.e., acute toxicity to insects, relatively long half- lives in soil, and high water solubility, that result in potentially deleterious effects, either directly or indirectly, on numerous taxa, it is imperative to determine if these chemicals are present in Missouri wetlands either due to direct application (i.e., planting treated seeds) or through surface water or ground water runoff or other means of transport, in concentrations that may cause harm to beneficial, non-target aquatic invertebrates and other taxa. || Neonicotinoid insecticides (NI) are commonly used as seed-treatments on major agricultural row crops (e.g., corn). Indeed, neonicotinoid treated agricultural crops are often planted directly in floodplain wetlands managed for wildlife, specifically waterfowl. Numerous studies have documented impacts of neonicotinoids to aquatic invertebrates in laboratory and mesocosm settings; however, there is limited information on impacts to aquatic invertebrate in field settings. We investigated invertebrate community response to planting of neonicotinoid-treated seed in managed wetland ecosystems in Missouri. In 2016, we sampled water, sediment, and aquatic invertebrates from 22 paired wetlands during spring (prewetland drawdown) and fall (post-wetland flood-up) followed by a third sampling period (spring 2017). During summer, portions of study wetlands were planted with either neonicotinoid-treated corn or untreated corn (control). Water and sediment concentrations of the three most common neonicotinoids were used to calculate overall NI toxicity equivalents (NI-EQs) based on an additive model of NI toxic equivalency factors. Mean total NI-EQs for sediment (0.60 g/kg) were an order of magnitude greater than water (0.02 g/L). Water quality parameters and pesticide concentrations were used to evaluate effects of neonicotinoid concentrations on aquatic macroinvertebrates using a series of generalized linear mixed effects models. Preliminary results indicate an overall decrease in aquatic invertebrate diversity and abundance with increasing NI-EQs in both wetland water and sediments. Post-treatment, treated wetlands had lower benthic invertebrate diversity and abundance compared to untreated wetlands, but a recovery in abundance and diversity followed in spring 2017. Our results have implications for aquatic invertebrates and wetland-dependant species (e.g., migrating birds) as neonicotinoid concentrations, although below regulatory limits, are impacting wetland ecosystems. Research results will be useful to wetland managers in making decisions regarding use of neonicotinoid seed-treatments, specifically, and potentially, provide broader considerations of the role agriculture may play in future wetland management and conservation plans. | | |[ Which geese are being harvested? Body condition of lesser snow (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) and Ross's Geese (C. rossii) harvested by different methods during the light goose conservation order. ](/coopunits/project/115038949376/dfowle2) | December 2019 || The increase of mid-continent light goose populations over the past thirty years and subsequent impacts to Arctic and sub-Arctic habitats has been well documented (e.g., Abraham and Jefferies 1997, Jefferies et al. 2004). Liberalization of regular season hunting regulations and initiation of a light goose conservation order (LGCO) in both Canada and the United States were implemented to decrease mid-continent light goose populations to help alleviate impacts to northern habitats. Despite the liberalizations of hunting regulations, which have increased harvest (Kruse and Fronczak 2012), current efforts appear to be ineffective in reducing light goose populations (Alisauskas et al. 2011). Harvest of certain segments of light goose populations may not be aiding in population reduction. Preliminary data collected during spring 2012 in Nebraska indicated that light geese harvested over decoys weighed approximately 100g less than those harvested by pass shooting or sneaking and stalking. Although the total number of light geese harvested with various methods are unknown, survey data from participants in the light goose conservation order in Nebraska indicate that >70% of hunters/participants use electronic calls (M. Vrtiska, Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, unpublished data), meaning that a large percentage of light geese in Nebraska are harvested over decoys. Thus, if most of the individuals harvested in the light goose conservation order are in poorer body condition than the general population, and populations are structured through compensative mortality, current harvest strategies may actually benefit populations by lessening impacts of competition for food and other resources. Additionally, species, sex, and age composition of the harvest during the LGCO and possible implications for harvest management have not been assessed. Rockwell and Ankney (2000) indicated that 1.41 million light geese would need to be harvested to have an effect on the population. While Ross's geese have been identified as overabundant in the U.S. (Moser 2001), the primary species impacting Arctic and sub-Arctic habitats are lesser snow geese. Disproportionate harvest of Ross's geese may decrease the effectiveness of the LGCO in reducing lesser snow goose populations and conserving those habitats. From band recovery information, Alisauskas et al. (2011) reported that the LGCO had proportionally greater influence on adult survival, but also recognized that large numbers of juveniles were being harvested and fewer juveniles may be available to LGCO harvest after fall and winter mortality. Because the majority of lesser snow geese do not breed until 3 years of age (Cooke et al. 1995), harvest of a disproporitonate number of juvenile birds may have a latent effect on populations. Finally, if males are more susceptable to harvest, then the effectiveness of the LGCO is reduced given adult female survival is the key parameter in population reduction (Rockwell et al. 1997). Thus, differential vulnerability between lesser snow and Ross's geese, juvenile vs. adults, and males vs. females all may impact the effectiveness of the LGCO on reducing mid-continent light goose populations. Assessing body condition of light geese harvested by various methods during the LGCO and examining species, sex and age composition of the harvest would provide insight to other impacts of harvest efforts to reduce populations.

This will help to develop a monitoring and conservation program for the river that maximizes probability of detection in mussel trends and probability of success for management actions. In a crucial step in our long-term plan for a conservation assessment of Missouri's mussel fauna (Figure 1), we will use geomorphological and landscape models that identify potential core areas of abundance in the Meramec River (in progress, funded in FY15) and conduct validated and standardized sampling within those areas to determine the presence or absence of mussel concentrations in sites that otherwise have the fundamental features necessary for mussel presence. Based on correlates of occupancy of diverse mussel assemblages in these areas, we will identify risks and threats on the landscape, including both natural (e.g., isolation) and anthropogenic (e.g., dams) factors that could threaten mussel assemblages. From this information, we can classify existing areas as either: 1) vacant habitats with high potential for occupancy; 2) occupied habitats at risk; and 3) occupied habitats at low risk and develop monitoring plans and protocols for each based on their risk status.

In the last 10 years the number of research studies evaluating ecological flows has quadrupled. Therefore, researchers, managers, and policy makers need to keep up to date on the latest research to help inform ecological flow decisions. The Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) has made it a priority to be at the forefront of ecological flow science and to understand how flow alterations affect riverine systems and their biota. The information needed to address the diversity of ecological flow issues that will continue to arise due to climate change, increasing human population, and the associated increased demand for water make stream flow management a complex and long-term issue facing MDC. Recently, ecological flows were identified as one of the top five research needs by MDC's Fisheries Division and it was listed as one of 20 priority research topics during MDC's Strategic Research Planning Committee's efforts to identify long-term research programs. In addition, one of Fisheries Division's Stretch Goals is establishing adequate ecological flows in Missouri streams in advance of increasing water demands and associated water supply and energy development projects. MDC has broadened its approach to stream flow management by incorporating steps based on an established scientific framework for determining appropriate ecological flows (ELOHA; Poff et al 2010). Over the past two decades, the science of ecological flows has shifted from a narrow focus on minimum flows to a broader view that a complex range of flows is needed to account for seasonal and inter-annual variation in the magnitude, timing, frequency, duration, and rate of change of stream flows (Poff et al. 1997; Richter 2011). This natural flow paradigm recognizes that ecological processes of aquatic and water-dependent ecosystems are driven by naturally variable flows. As a result, flow recommendations now typically use a framework for determining appropriate ecological flows across different seasons and years in an attempt to represent the intra- and inter-annual variability of flow. MDC has been working internally and with partners to develop the information needed for various steps of the established framework. The first step in this effort was the classification of Missouri streams and development of the Missouri Hydrologic Assessment Tool (MOHAT) software to better understand hydrologic alterations (Kennen et al. 2009). Following the development of the classification system and the hydrologic tools their utility were evaluated as part of a cooperative project with the University of Missouri. Recently, MDC funded a literature review to identify fish species responses linked to stream flow alteration metrics, which identified 76 studies that evaluated fish responses to flow with over 400 occurrences for both hydrologic and biologic metrics and over 200 significant biologic responses to varying flow components. Biologic responses are likely species (see Figure 1), system, or region-specific, further emphasizing the complexity of biotic interactions with stream flow and limiting the ability to generate a list of overarching metrics that consistently showed similar responses. The literature review found that information is needed regarding how flow alterations of various types and relative magnitudes affect fish communities in different Missouri streams. || Ensuring adequate water quantity and quality in stream, riparian, and wetland systems is a pressing issue worldwide and the science related to stream flow management is rapidly evolving.

Initial Information Review: Standardization of electrofishing output will minimize bias, reduce variation in catch, and allow for more valid spatial and temporal comparisons of sample data (Bonar and Hubert 2002, Miranda 2009), regardless of the electrofishing control box used. Biologists need to know how conductivity of the water relates to the effective conductivity of Smallmouth Bass (SMB), Blue Catfish (BLC) and Flathead Catfish (FHC), hereafter referred to individually by the abbreviations or collectively as bass and catfish, in order to develop standardized electrofishing output goals that are species specific and maintain a desired capture-prone fish response (e.g., taxis or immobilization) across a range of water conductivities, water temperatures, and fish sizes. The effective power (the product of current and voltage) transferred from the water to the fish during electrofishing is a critical electrical factor affecting fish response; power transfer depends on the ratio of fish conductivity to water conductivity (Kolz 1989, Kolz and Reynolds 1989, Reynolds and Kolz 2012). Effective fish conductivity is empirically derived based on the observed-behavioral response of live fish to electrical fields in tests across a range of water conductivity and is considered a constant for a given species (Kolz and Reynolds 1989, Dean and Temple 2011). Knowing the effective fish conductivity of a particular species would allow researchers to develop applied power, voltage, and amperage goal tables, standardized by power, for use by biologists when sampling targeted species. Standardizing electrofishing output by power as part of long-term sampling programs has been shown to reduce catch variance by up to 15% (Burkhardt and Gutreuter 1995), and would improve MDC's ability to more accurately assess and monitor bass and catfish populations. With the exception of Asian carp and snakeheads, only general estimates of effective power goals exist, and these were derived from warmwater fish community information using a general value for effective fish conductivity (Burkhardt and Gutreuter 1995; Miranda 2009), and are not applicable to bass or catfish, two of the most important species groups to Missouri anglers. To determine the most effective electrical waveform settings and develop target output goals for a particular species, experimental trials using a range of electrofisher settings at varying water conductivity levels and water temperatures are conducted in a controlled (i.e., aquaria) environment with a homogenous electric field to determine optimal settings that achieve a defined capture-prone fish response (e.g., immobilization). For example, using a fish conductivity value derived in a controlled laboratory setting, standardized power (and voltage) goal tables were recently developed to electrofish Asian carp and have resulted in improved catch rates of juvenile fish (K. Anderson, USGS, personal communication). The same process was recently conducted to identify optimal electrofisher settings successfully used in the field to collect snakeheads (A. Temple, USFWS, personal communication). To date, no work has focused specifically on SMB, and very little has focused on acceptable surrogate species such as Largemouth Bass (Dolan and Miranda 2003; Miranda and Dolan 2004; Miranda 2005). Even less work has been done on BLC and FHC (Bodine et al. 2013). Since past work has been carried out on different sized fish, across a limited range of electrofisher settings (due in part to electrofishing control box limitations), or as part of a warmwater fish community sample, it is difficult to confidently apply those findings to the specific species discussed in this proposal. Who is requesting the new information: Fisheries Division and Resource Science Division Staff, specifically the MDC Sampling Protocol Subcommittee of the Smallmouth Bass Working Group along with the Big River and Truman Reservoir-Lake of the Ozarks Blue Catfish and Flathead Catfish Working Groups. Electrofishing experts who instruct the USFWS Principles and Techniques of Electrofishing Course and other electrofishing specialists along with agency biologists looking to develop (or refine) sampling protocols for these species in other states. Why is the information needed: Black bass and catfish are popular sportfish in Missouri. Missouri's 1.1 million anglers spend about 15 million days on the water each year, and about 77% of that time is spent pursuing bass or catfish species, making them the two most popular groups of fishes among Missouri anglers (U.S. Department of the Interior 2011). The ability to accurately assess bass and catfish populations is needed to evaluate special regulations and monitor population trends and is critical to the credibility of MDC to make scientifically-sound management decisions. Combined with electrofishing training, this research will give biologists the tools and knowledge necessary to measure and adjust their electrofishing output applied in the field, allowing them to sample these species in a standardized, efficient, and safe manner. Any increase in sampling accuracy and precision (possibly as much as 15% [Burkhardt and Gutreuter 1995] or more) can provide higher confidence in making management decisions when changes in catch per unit effort (CPUE) occur. Further, standardization is critical for comparisons across lakes or rivers or when assessing long-term trends within a lake or river (Bonar and Hubert 2002, Miranda 2009). The knowledge gained from this work will also ensure consistency in data collection as biologists retire and new biologists are hired, which is critical for long-term evaluation of population trends (McClelland et al. 2013). Additionally, BLC and FHC population assessments in the Missouri and Mississippi rivers are high priority information needs being addressed by the Big River Catfish Working Group. Missouri's Catfish Management Plan (Dames et al. 2003) contains objectives to develop and refine standardized sampling techniques for both species in reservoirs and large rivers, respectively. Previous work reported high sample variation (e.g., CV > 50%) using existing boat electrofishing methods to sample FHC in the lower Missouri River (Travnichek 2011) and tributary rivers (Ford et al. 2011). Despite being the most commonly used gear, the unique behavioral response (i.e., surfacing 100 m from the electrofishing boat) of BLC and FHC to electrofishing is not well understood and it is unclear what level of electrofishing power (threshold power) or most efficient electrical waveform is necessary to consistently achieve a capture-prone response at varying water conductivities and water temperatures, and to collect a representative sample of all fish sizes (Bodine et al. 2013). Immediacy of Information Need? Results will standardize current electrofishing protocols for SMB in Missouri streams and will be immediately incorporated. Future work on sampling protocols will also utilize this information. Results will help develop standardized electrofishing sampling protocols for BLC and FHC in the Missouri River and Mississippi River but also apply to sampling in streams and large reservoirs and will be immediately incorporated. || Electrofishing is a common sampling technique to collect fish, but biologist may use different setting that may create bias in the collections. There has been very little research on what electrofishing waveforms are best to collect popular sportfish like Smallmouth bass, Flathead Catfish, and Blue Catfish. This work is in collaboration with the US Fish and Wildlife Service and several state agencies. Our work is helping managers determine what waveforms that product the fish response that will most likely collect these species and is being used to refine standardized sampling methods to help managers make better informed decisions of the management of fish populations. | | |[ Assessing the Impact of Climate Change on Global Inland Fisheries ](/coopunits/project/115004588032/cpaukert) | December 2019 || Aquatic biota is particularly vulnerable to climate change and its associated effects, but these effects, both distributional and physiological, will differ by species and region. Approximately 50 percent of available cold and cool water fish habitats are expected to disappear with projected doubling of atmospheric CO2 (Eaton and Scheller 1996; Mohseni et al. 2003), while warm water fish habitat is expected increase by 31 percent (Mohseni et al. 2003). For example, cold water trout in the Mountain West of the U.S. may lose substantial habitat due to increasing water temperature and altered flows (Wenger et al. 2011). Increasing water temperatures and altered flows have also been linked to increased disease in brown trout in Switzerland (Hari et al. 2006). Similarly, Lassalle and Rochard (2009) projected species-specific distribution shifts across North Africa, Europe, and the Middle East under 21st century climate predictions. Likewise, in Wisconsin, a 3\u00b0C increase in air temperature is estimated to cause a loss of approximately 343,034km of cold and cool water fish habitats (Lyons et al. 2010). Climate change may also be linked to physiological effects (P\u00f6rtner and Knust 2007; Pease and Paukert 2014), and behavioral or competitive effects (Poloczanska et al. 2008, Rahel and Olden 2008). For example, Pease and Paukert (2014) predicted that smallmouth bass in the U.S. Midwest could grow about 6% for every 1 \u00b0C increase in water temperature, but would need 27% more food to reach that level of growth. While these physiological effects may have as significant an effect on ecological systems as distributional changes, there is much less research on these projected impacts. Inland fish species, and their associated fisheries, are especially vulnerable to climate changes, both distributional and physiological, because they have limited habitat availability and a more direct link with terrestrial systems, land use patterns, and water use than marine systems. Climate change impacts on these inland systems may be magnified as a result of climate impacts to terrestrial systems and human interventions. To date, little research has investigated climate change effects on inland fisheries at a global scale. || Freshwater biodiversity is declining at a faster rate than any terrestrial biome and the threats posed by anthropogenic land-use, climate change, flow modification, and invasive species are likely to exasperate the situation. These changes will often be driven by changes in temperature and precipitation. Our work, in collaboration with the USGS Climate Adaptation Center and partners helped synthesize how climate change affects fish in North America, and has developed a plan that can be used to assess how climate change may affect fishes at a global scale, which can be implemented by FAO and others to manage fishes under a changing climate. | | |[ Post WNS bat ecology in the eastern United States ](/coopunits/project/115001647104/laustin3) | December 2024 || This project is a comprehensive investigation of the foraging and roosting ecology and distribution of bats in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast following White-nose Syndrome with emphasis on the threatened Northern long-eared bat and the endangered Indiana bat. Work has expanding to encompass Coastal Plain bat ecology including migratory patterns of non-hibernating bats. Project cooperators include US Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, Department of Defense, NASA, and numerous state agencies and NGOs throughout the region. || This project is a comprehensive investigation of the foraging and roosting ecology and distribution of bats in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast following White-nose Syndrome with emphasis on the threatened Northern long-eared bat and the endangered Indiana bat. Work has expanding to encompass Coastal Plain bat ecology in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic for these species. The Virginia Unit has been working with several persisting populations, notably in the DC-metro area, northeastern North Carolina, Long Island, New York and the upper Ohio Valley with efforts focused documenting natural ecology and to ascertain what factors allow for persistence. Data from this work helps inform a wide array of land management efforts such as forest management, military training and energy development where these species occur or could be recovered.

Currently the major threats are habitat degradation, non-native species, and climate change. Due to concern about non-native species, one management strategy is the removal of non-native fish species and stocking from a captive brood source. Translocation success rates for cutthroat trout are often less than 50%. Increased knowledge of stocked fish survival and movement post-stocking is needed to understand why cutthroat trout are failing to establish and improve translocation success rates. This project is a collaboration with Wyoming Game and Fish Department and is taking place in LaBarge Creek, Wyoming, the site of a large-scale restoration project where hatchery-reared Colorado River cutthroat trout have failed to establish or reproduce. This study will provide useful insight into the causes of establishment failure. It will also provide information on the best time, size, and habitat in which to stock fish to maximize translocation success. || Colorado River cutthroat trout populations have declined across their range.

We will evaluate the minimum population size at which a populations are unlikely to go extinct and the population persistence times of various ungulate species across the Southwest in relation to variation in observed demographic rates. The intent is to generate population models using a suite of observed demographic parameters (and their variability), thereby assisting in management of multiple ungulate species across the southwestern United States. || Understanding the importance of life history parameters is vital to managing wildlife populations. In collaboration with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, we are evaluating the minimum population size, optimal demographic characteristics (e.g., survival, recruitment), and release strategies (e.g., number of animals and translocation schedules) that balance population growth and persistence for both target and source populations involved in translocation efforts. Furthermore, through our modeling efforts, we are also evaluating the effects of recurring droughts and various predator management strategies on the trajectories of translocated populations. Many translocation efforts fail to achieve management objectives, frequently due to a failure to fully consider demographic, management and climatic contexts in which the translocations are implemented. This work will inform wildlife management agencies on translocation strategies that are most likely to lead to population persistence of both source and target populations involved in these translocation efforts. | | |[ Predation rates and use of habitats and wildlife drinkers by mountain lions ](/coopunits/project/114968580096/hunter.prude) | July 2020 || For decades, State and Federal wildlife management agencies have built and supplied man-made water sources within desert landscapes, making surface water a consistent and stable feature. However, some have speculated that the provision of surface water could be counterproductive for management because it may: 1) lure ungulates from preferable areas (such as escape terrain) thereby increasing their risk of predation; 2) predators may linger near water sources to increase their chances of killing a visiting ungulate; and 3) water sources may make areas previously inhospitable for carnivores hospitable, exacerbating losses in ungulates. Thus by providing surface water to increase ungulate populations, it may attract predators (and prey), thereby increasing kills on ungulate species. The goals of this project are to evaluate the effect that wildlife drinkers have on mountain lion habitat selection and to determine if mountain lion kills are disproportionately located near man-made perennial water sources. The project is a collaborative effort between the New Mexico Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, Armendaris Ranch, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, and Arizona Game and Fish Department. || Wildlife management agencies maintain man-made water sources for wildlife in arid environments based on long-held assumptions that it benefits wildlife and does not have adverse consequences. However, some have speculated that these water sources may allow predators to occupy areas that would otherwise be inhospitable and that predators use these water sources to ambush prey, thus increasing predation on species that these water developments are intended to benefit. In collaboration with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish and Arizona Game and Fish Department we are determining the effect of man-made water sources on mountain lion habitat and prey selection and if kill sites of ungulates are disproportionately located near man-made water sources (i.e., waters are used as ambush sites). The results of this study could have impacts on wildlife water development programs across the West. Furthermore, this project will greatly expand our knowledge on large carnivore water dependency and the influence of water on predator space use, resource selection and predator-prey dynamics in arid ecosystems. | | |[ Habitat selection in an Arctic Seabird: Implications for Climate Change ](/coopunits/project/114953869312/Mark.Colwell) | December 2019 || Climate change is projected to have its greatest impact in arctic regions where temperature increases are forecasted to cause rapid changes to ecosystems and the wildlife dependent on them. These changes range from phenological mismatches (i.e/, between the timing of emergence of invertebrate prey and the arrival and breeding of shorebird predators; Liebezeit et al. 2014) to altered habitats where warmer climates favor successional changes in plant communities. The Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla; hereafter \"sandpiper\") is an abundant, arctic shorebird whose breeding range extends across nearly all of the Nearctic. The sandpiper breeds in wet coastal tundra that is likely to be strongly affected by climate change. Recent evidence suggests a decline in population size of the Semipalmated Sandpiper (Andres et al. 2012), but the cause of this decline is unknown. Despite its abundance, little is known regarding nest site selection by breeding Semipalmated Sandpipers (Jehl 2006). In the face of global climate change, it is likely that the population of sandpipers will be affected by changing habitats. The goal of this research is to investigate current aspects of habitat selection by Semipalmated Sandpipers in order to predict how future changes will affect their habitats and population. || The California Cooperative Fish & Wildlife Research Unit will be collaborating with the U.S. Geological Survey, Alaska to examine habitat selection by Semipalmated Sandpipers in the Colville River delta, Alaska. Specific objectives are to: 10 quantify nest site selection of sandpipers breeding in the coastal plain of arctic Alaska; and 2) discuss implications in relation to changing habitats as influenced by global climate change. | | |[ Seasonal movements of rainbow trout, brown trout, and mountain whitefish in the Smith River, Montana ](/coopunits/project/113889060864/michael.j.lance) | January 2019 || Movements of stream-dwelling fishes can be obstructed or hindered by habitat alterations and in-stream barriers, and such fragmentation of habitats deleteriously affects many taxa worldwide. Conversely, diverse movement and life history patterns can optimize resource availability, increase genetic exchange, and promote population resilience to environmental disturbances. Fish that move can access food, favorable thermal conditions, and spawning substrates that may be unavailable or limited within local habitat patches. Along with our Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks partners, we sought to comprehensively determine the factors affecting unconstrained fish movements (species, physical drivers, seasons, and landscapes) and how movements and vital rates (survival, site fidelity) interrelate in a large, inland watershed, while also avoiding some common limitations of movements studies (e.g., limited spatial or temporal scopes, species, and sample sizes). Specifically, we determined the movement patterns and vital rates of three abundant salmonids\u2014brown trout (Salmo trutta), mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)\u2014in the Smith River watershed of central Montana, an unfragmented system with three distinct geomorphic regions. Watershed-scale movements were common, diverse, and overlapped, thereby connecting distant groups of fish. Volume of movements of each species peaked at specific locations and during specific seasons. Patterns of survival also varied among species and locations, and movements throughout the Smith River watershed connected fish populations in habitats with relatively high survival, where populations were probably most stable, to habitats where survival was lower but per capita resource availability was probably higher. Studies restricted in scope to single species or seasons of interest risk mischaracterizing vital rates and the diversity of movements expressed by a fish assemblage. Accounting for the diversity and spatial extent of movement patterns expressed by all species in a fish assemblage will promote life history and species diversity while helping to ensure the persistence of robust fish populations. Managers may perhaps best protect life history diversity of inland fishes by emulating management of highly migratory anadromous fishes, which seeks to facilitate unhindered movements. || Movements of stream-dwelling fishes can be obstructed or hindered by habitat alterations and in-stream barriers, and such fragmentation of habitats deleteriously affects many taxa worldwide.

However, each of these metrics is estimated from a single visit to Kenai Fjords and Katmai National Parks annually. Data resulting from a single observation are recognized as potentially influenced by events that occur both prior to and following the visit, including breeding failure, and egg and chick mortality. Additionally, the collection of prey remains brought to nest sites to provision chicks can only reflect what was provided prior to the collection date and does not include data about soft bodied prey, prey items brought to chicks away from the nest site, or prey items brought to the area by other birds such as gulls and crows. To address these issues, we propose examining black oystercatcher nests, diet and chick provisioning to ensure robust interpretation of trends observed in long term monitoring data collected for this species. Our objectives in the proposed research are to: (1) estimate productivity at 20 black oystercatcher nest sites over two years, (2) determine sources of disturbance and mortality to adults, eggs, and chicks prior to fledging, (3) estimate rates of energy delivery to chicks through repeated collections of prey shell remains and observations of prey deliveries, and (4) estimate productivity and fledging success as a function of prey provisioning. || The black oystercatcher serves as a \"keystone\" species that is important in structuring nearshore systems and is highly susceptible to human disturbance. Current inventory and monitoring efforts may not adequately address the information needs for estimating long-term trends for this species. To address these issues, we propose examining black oystercatcher nests, diet and chick provisioning to ensure robust interpretation of trends observed in long term monitoring data collected for this species. The project is a collaborative effort with the National Park Service and the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. We will evaluate current and alternative methods for monitoring black oystercatcher reproductive success and produce recommendations useful to wildlife managers. | | |[ Assessing shorebird use of lagoons in Cape Krusenstern National Monument ](/coopunits/project/110306185216/Megan_Boldenow) | December 2018 || Cape Krusenstern National Monument's (CAKR) coastline includes lagoons and estuaries, which are important areas for migratory birds breeding and staging activities.

For instance, kokanee suffered significant declines in the late 1960s in Lake Pend Oreille, but the exact cause(s) have not been identified. Similar declines have been described throughout the western United States and Canada. Numerous hypotheses have been posited as causing kokanee declines in Idaho; namely water development, the introduction of opossum shrimp Mysis diluviana, predation, and exploitation. In an effort to supplement or maintain kokanee populations, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) has instituted large-scale hatchery supplementation of the species. However, the success of hatchery supplementation in Idaho is varied, necessitating a better understanding of the ecology of kokanee and the comparative success of different breeding groups (e.g., early-run, late-run). Underlying research questions associated with understanding the management of kokanee in Idaho is the need to address uncertainty surrounding common sampling techniques (e.g., mid-water trawls, hydroacoustics). Therefore, the goals of the research are to 1) evaluate the biases of mid-water trawling, 2) investigate interspecific competition between mysids and kokanee, and 3) evaluate the performance of kokanee breeding groups (early-run, late-run) in Idaho. || Despite considerable research over the last 60 years, numerous questions remain regarding appropriate management of kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka in Idaho.
