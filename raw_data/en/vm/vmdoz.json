Burnham s ees a decline from the Vi ctorian \"men of sci ence\" to a situation in the mid-1980s where wh at passed as the populari sation of science consi sted of little more than a litany of unrel ated facts. Burnham' s contention is that these \"sci entific facts\" will not travel as such (that is, as scientific fact s) unless th ey are firmly embedded withi n a coher ent scientific framework. It is this fr amework - a theory capable of organi sing the data - that he per ceives to be lacking from the modern popularisatio n. Whilst this may have been the case at the time Burnha m was writing (the mid-1980s), it is a position that is incr easingly untenabl e today. Look ing here at the popularisation of psychology, this pa per demonstrat es how t hose unif ying theor ies have since returned. Through a close reading of Steven Pi nker's 1997 How The Mind Wor ks (in comparison wi th Cyril Burt's 1933 book of the same title), this paper illustrates the ways in wh ich facts and theories are interpolated by t he moder n popula riser in precisely the manner that Burnham feared had been abandoned forever. PART I Introducti on: S cience St udies and P opularisati ons Accessible v ersions of Copernic an or Baconian science from the seventeenth and eighteen th century notwithstandi ng, most commentators take science popularis ation in the modern (a nd signific ant) sens e1 to have begun in the ni neteenth century. For example, Massimiano Bucchi, who, beginni ng a short survey of the histor y of po pulari sation, ma kes the clai m that \"[i]t is onl y since the second hal f of the nineteenth centur y, however, 1 That is, as a type of discourse distin ct from professional exchanges written specifically f or a non-professional pu blic. 1 that one can really t alk of 'lar ge scal e' communication of sci ence, explicitly addressed by it s authors not just to spec ific audiences but to the general public ('gr and publi c')\" (Bucch i 1998, 2). By scho lars of what has come to be k nown as science s tudies and to a lesser ext ent by hi storians of sci ence (these bei ng, at their boundaries, inter changeable f ields), the populari sation of sci ence i s increa singly (and seen as a politically charged operati on: defini ng, for both t he public and, recur sively, the community of scientist s, a more coherent image of s cience its elf.2 The populari sation is seen as a point of contact between the scientific profession and the interest ed public , and a principal channel for the transf er of science i nformation into th e public domain. Th is paper looks at how one prominent account of populari sations no longer serv es as an accur ate representation of the acti vity it describes. How Superstition W on and Sci ence Lost (1987) is John Bur nham' s histori cal survey of the popul arisati on of science and health in the US. Partly as a consequenc e of the time the book was being composed (the mid 1980s) and partl y as an act of alle giance to hi s chosen titl e, Burnham claims that the popul arisati on of sci ence has been deteri orating si nce t he Victori an age.3 It is not at all cl ear that such a cl aim can be supported today. This is not intend ed as an attack on Burnham's work, but rather, to suggest that the character of popula r science writing ha s shifted in the years sin ce How Super stition Won was published (198 7), such that the presentati on of trivial and unrel ated fa cts (a ch arge Burnham brings against populari sations of sci ence of th e 1960s, 70s and 80 s) is no longer 2 Which may include an a genda for fu ture research, a canonical version of the history of the discipline, and the prioritisat ion of certain key figures and discoveries, often linking one to the other in a manner that loses in historica l accuracy what it gains in simplicity. 3 It's worth n oting that B urnham believes that society as a whole is in decline, and h as been on this trajectory since the Vict orian age. His other publications include: Paths into Am erican Culture: Psycholog y, Medicine, a nd Morals (1988), Bad Habits: Drinking, Smoking, Taking Drugs, Ga mbling, Sexual Misbehavior, and Swearing in Am erican History (199 3). 2 a definiti ve characteristic of the ge nre. His chief complaint with later populari sations i s their failure t o incorpor ate a sci entific worl dview whi ch might as a substitute for outmoded religious worldv iews. Howev er, in contrast to Burn ham's pessimi since t he publi cation of How Super stition W on, much mai nstream popular science writing has become increasingly oriented towards \"holistic\" or \"unifying\" themes - in some cases leading to qui te extraor dinary statement s of sci entific evangelism which have (especially in the shade of - and per haps as a r esponse to - the Science War s) served as t he locus for hostile exch anges bet ween represent atives he scientific and non-sci entific disciplines.4 The traject ory Burnham plotted based upon his research up to the nineteen eighties has, as it happens , proved to be misl eading. Reviewing the hist ory of popularisati on of health, psychology, and natur al sci ence in the US, Bur nham gene rates a f our part model, charting a gener al theor y of t he broad devel opment (and dec line) of populari sation over extended time. (This axis is in cont rast to many commentators, such as Bucchi [1998], Hil gartner [199 0], and Lewenst ein [2001], who are primarily interested in latitudinal transfer of sp ecialist kn owledge.) Burnham i s pessimi stic about t he project (but for different reasons to Stanl ey Fi sh [1995, 70+], for exampl e, or Richard Feynman [( 1959) 1990, 58] - both of whom think that blocks ex ist integral to th e techni cal natur e of speci alist scientifi \"pur e\" knowledge to market forc es, and thus producing a product which will be 4 Notable among these is E. O. Wilson's Consilie nce (which argues for methodological monism across the disciplinary spectrum ), published in 1998. Talk of a scientific worldview is something seen with so me regularity in popular science writ ing: Richard Dawkins (esp. A Devil' s Chaplain [2003]), Stephen Jay Gould (in many, many essays) and Steven Weinberg (in Drea ms of a Final The ory [1992], e sp. 167+) all offer the scientif ic per spective as a corrective to methodological and logical errors in fields outside their specialism. But even Ca rl Sagan's Cosm os (198 0) or Jacob Bronowski's Ascent of Man (1973) (both of which were available to Burnham) offer similarly broad surveys. 3 increasingly commercialised until it is without scientifically cr edible content. Epistemol ogical decay is inevit able (says Burnham) as populari sed science be comes a co mmodity, a sal eable bra nd. (Thomas Gieryn, independently, ta kes the same approac h, comparing sci ence wi th Coca- Cola.5) Burnham ms that the histor y of the populari sation of any branch of sci ence f ollows a si milar pattern c onsequent role played by popul arisati on: 1) Diffusi on - when science di d not need condensation, simplificati on, and tr anslation; 2) Populari zation - when men of science tr ied to shar e their vision of t he religi on of sci ence; 3) Dilution - when popularizati on passed into the hands of educator s, who r epresented scie nce only at second hand, and simultaneous ly, journalists; 4) Triviali sation - when popula r science consi of impot ent snippets of news , the produc t of authority figures. (Burnham 1987, 226) Stage 1 represents a direct transmis sion of information, s tage 2 is a high poi nt of target ed popul ar comm unication, but stage 3 si gnals the beginni ng of a gradual deca y, su ch th at by stag e 4 the infor mation is so mangled and di storted as almos t unrecogn a decreasi ng ratio of si gnal to noise. At stage 1, there is no popul arisation because ther e is no functional rol e for popularisation: the vocabul ary an d conceptual apparatu s of sci ence is 5 That is, as brands that are marketed - just as C oke succee ds because it has managed to persuade th e public that a minor difference (bet ween its own cola and t hat of rival companies) is in fact a vast and important difference , so science has managed to persuade the public th at there is a vast and important diffe rence between scient ific claims and claims from other discip lines. See Gieryn 1987. 4 continuous with the expected intelle ctual range of the general intelligent reader. By stage 4, t he scientific knowledge is abstruse, and populari sation is of very low quality. What is unclear is the causal mechani sm at wor k here. Burnham's stages are interes ting he re inasmuc h as they sugges t a gradual lowering of the reliabili ty of the content of the sci entific knowledge in popul ar presentati ons as sci ence itself becomes increasingly sophi sticated (and i ncreasingly re liable), and the gap between the professional and the lay reader widens t o a po int where communication involves such a to tal level of conversion th at the received message possesses alm ost no trace of the origi nal signal. In other wor ds, it seems to be the case that the de cline of the qual ity of popularisation i s causall y related to the difficul ty of the science it is trying to popularise and explai n. If it were the case that some ca usal mechanism exis ted s uch that populari sation was possibl e only for a science in its (technical) infancy, then thi s model would seem to prohibit the successful popul arisati on of compl ex science, or at least it would show an i nverse relationshi p between the complexity of the sci ence and the re liability of the populari sation. (It is clear that some relat ion holds between popularisation of sci ence and the t echnical sophistica tion of that sci ence i nasmuch advent of popularisation is oc casioned by science's achieving a particular level of sophistication.) However, i t seems more likely t hat B urnham's stor y is not prescripti ve and necessar y, but descr iptive and conting ent. It happens to be the case (so far as Bu rnham sees it) that sc ience has improv ed and sation has declin the sation is somethi ng Burnham blames vari ously on the market for ces that encour age sensat ionalis m in the press (and a pres s more aware of and willin g to respond to thes e forces than their ninet eenth-century predeces sors), and - most curi ously - what he call s 5 the \"destructive effect of fac ts\" (Burnham 1987 , 229). This amounts to \"reducing the cont ext of science in p opulariz ing and at the s ame time emphasi zing 'facts' so that 'science ' in populari zing consi sted of isol ated bits and pieces \" (Burnham 1987, 229). F or Burnham, what's mi ssing from t he popularisations of the later twentieth centur y is theor etical sc ope. It is no acci dent that he (positively) characteri ses st age 2 popul arisation (i n whi ch he i ans - John Tyndall, Thomas Huxl ey - and s ome early Science Serv ice bulletins) as pr eaching a \"reli gion\" of science. Before returning to the relati on between fact, theory, and populari zation bel ow, it is worth noting at this point that Burnham's theory of knowl edge transfer co nflates the worldview ience's technic o-epis temic content. In other words, no explicit distinction is made (at least within this schema) betw een two important types of popularisation: (a) the eff orts made to make science popular, and (b) the eff orts made to make scient ific knowledge more accessi ble. It ought to be cl ear that these are tw o very different tasks (roughly, propaganda and pe dagogy). The first can be ac complis hed with a minimum of the second. Popularising (and rei nforcing the status of) science as a cultural practi ce or in stituti on (such as the men-in-white- coats favoured by advert isers) need not involve itself with the presentati on of any subst antive mat erial, and usual ly is more effecti ve if it does not. On the other hand, purely educative materi als - such as textb ooks - ma y have alm ost nothing to say about the so-called \"scientific worldview\" and usual ly remain agnostic with regar d to science' s potential to ser ve a religious or quasi-reli gious fu nction within society. That said, for Burnham, categori es (a) and (b) above are to some extent entwined, and 6 to teach science wit hout the t heory of science (including t he sceptical, materialist worldview) is not to teach science at all. In the popular imagination, the s cientific is often equated with the factual; or at the very least, inasmuch as the fact is th e point at which a given clai m (theor y, post ulate, hypothesi s) touches the worl d, the mor e facts can be pr esented in support, the closer the fit between theory and world. Meanwhile, t heories ar e seen as potentially suspect, certai nly easier to dispute. (Thi s is noti ceable in the ma nner that creati onists evolut act\" or By emphasi sing the semantic proximity of \"theoretical\" and \" speculative,\" the security of the theory is eroded). A theory can change, but the facts offered i n support ar e immutable. To say \"facts ca n be made to fit any theor y\" doesn't attack the status of the facts, but instead serves as a reminder t hat facts are mer cenary wit h respect to the theo ries they serve. Attached to the wrong theory, facts ca n be misleading - but this ability to mislead i s in itself a f unction of our re spect for facts. So aligned, the facts themselves take no reduction in thei r truth status, but they cease to be evidential claims in support of the truth. The theor y here i s surely the misleadi ng part. In t he absence of th eory, the facts may be entrusted to \"speak for themsel ves.\" Consequent ly, to bombard the public with \"scientific f acts\" mig ht seem the best way to persuade them that the scientists have the world figur ed ou t. Burnham holds the oppos ite view. So far as his version goes, the po pularis ation beco mes degraded not because it lacks fa ctual content, but precisel y beca use the factual cont ent increases. What c an acc ount for such a position? Burnham' s stance i s that the char acter of a knowl edge cl aim is exter nally defined. A \"fact\" is neither scientific nor u nscientific. Only when suitably positioned within a suitable theory does a fact be come sci entific. Burnham stresses t hat theoretical cons istency is, overall, more import ant than what could be called \"fact ual ma ss\" - whi ch is to say, it is the 7 theor etical framewor k that assures su ccessful sci entific communication, not si mply the massed pr esentation of disparate facts. This r epresent s a curious departure from the popular view of facts, but it is not without precedent. Writing in the mid- nineteen for ties, Edwi n Gut hrie argues much the same point in trying to per suade psychol ogists that what they requir e is not more f acts, but better theories: ... a scientific theory of learni ng has yet to be agreed upon by psych ologists. Su ch a theory is essential to progress for several reasons. One of these is that unles s the beads of fac t can be strung in order and pattern on the threads of a theor y, ther e is a strict limit ation upon imparting p sychological knowl edge t o others. Theories are mnemonic devices th at make sci ence teachable. And theories ar e the basi s of wo rking conc epts. They enable men to confront new fac ts and de al with them successfully. Furthermore, // theories are requ ired to dir ect the sear ch for relevant f acts. It is theories that endure, not facts. Event s are ephemeral and thei r descri ptions also may be ephemeral. It is theor y that lasts f or years or fo r gener ations. It is theor y rather than fact that leads t o new contro ls over natur e and event s. From theor y inferences can be made an d new applications devised. Facts ar e likely to be local and temporary. Their applicati on are limited. (G uthrie 1946 [from a speech given in 1945], 3-4) So it is not that the information isn' t there, it is that the information has not been (and i s not be ing) correctly organised. In a similar sense, Burnham' s decline- and-fa ll narrative is expl ained y of news\" [Bur nham 1987, 226]) come to replac e the \"religion of science.\" Burnham belie ves that the role of the science populari ser is to develop for the pub lic just such a wo rldview, one whi ch rationally account s for phenomen a and which might s erve as a counter balance to the forces of cr edulous \"superstiti on.\" Appar ently independently, bot h Burnha m and Gut hrie feel that the popularisation of 8 psychology suffers (in the 1940s as much as the 1980s) for want of theor etical orientati on. In a mor e general sense (that i s, not specifically concerned with the populari sation of psychology but with public knowledge generally ), this position i s informed and preceded by a piece on th e Popul ar Lecture written by J. G. Holland in 1865.6 \"For fact s alone the moder n American public does not go hungry ,\" claims Holland. But facts, he goes on to say, are not what the publ ic want: \"Men wi sh for nothi ng mor e than to know how to classify their facts, what to do with them, how to govern them, and how far to be governed by them.\" So far as Holland s ees it, \"the man who takes the fact s ... a nd organizes aro und them the popular thought, and uses them to give direction to t he popular life, and does all this with a masterful skill, is the man whose ho uses are never large enough to contain those who t hrong to him\" (H olland 1865, 367). In other words, what's required of the popul ariser (i n his or her capacit y as a public intellectual) is to arrange and cont extuali se information, not simpl y expose the public to fact s. Burnham's explic it sugge stion (and implicit in Guthrie) is that the scie ntific facts will not travel as such (that is, as scientific facts) unl ess th ey are firmly embedded within a coherent scientific framewor k. What Holland and Guthri e are calling fo r and what Burnham l ament s as being from a by gone age is a populari ser able to perform this task. Whethe r or not they exist ed at the time Burnham was writing, it can be shown that such po pularis ers of sc ience do ex ist today . devel opments in the popu larisation of ps ychology - a subject which occupies almost a th ird of Burnham's mat erial, and one whose populari sation he cl aims \"serves as a par adigm f or all of the sciences\" (Burnham 1987, 116) - stand as a count er-example to the drift 6 Burnham (1 987) quotes very briefly f rom Holland's 1865 article, so he is obviously aware of it, but although he doesn't r efer to the piece again, it seems that his posit ion on the importance of the oretical framework to popularisation is very muc h influenced by Holland's views. 9 of his ar gument. Steven Pinker's How The Mi nd Wor ks (1997) is an exemplar y case, where the t ext is ca refully str uctured around a lar ger hypothesi s. Discret e facts are not intr insically valuable for Pinker, and How The Mind Wor ks is not si mply a litany of granular, isol ated snippet s of information, but is instead pr esented as a coherent and for ceful promotion of a \"sci entific worl dview\" (albeit a contr oversi al one), wher e the facts stand in a similar relat ion to the gover ning (sci entific) theor y as character stands to narrati ve in a novel (whi ch is t o say: the f ormer i s embedded within the latter). Pink er, a psycholi nguist and cognitive scientist, is one of a group of popular science writers who bel ieve that t he human mi nd has evolved as a modular ( that is, task-specific) processor, adapted for the hunter-gather er lifestyl e that obt ained bef ore the rise of the great civilisations. This position, called Evolutionary Psychology (or EP), hol ds that modern humans may be maladapt ed to modern life. One of psychol ogy's functions i s to accoun t for man's anxiety in the world, and evolutionary psychology does this by assuring us that any sense of dislocation and unease is to be expected: our bodies and mi nds are hardwired in preparation for a world that no longer exists. Before moving on to discuss Pinker 's book at more length, it is import ant to note t hat the popularisati on of psychology is a special case of popul ar sci ence writing. In additi on to the problems attendant to any work attempting to translate techni cal knowledge into an ac cessible format (what Aldous Huxley called t he 58]) , to the popul arisati on of ps ychol ogy. W here populari sations of physi cs or biology st ruggl e to invent new ways to make their subject matter appealing to a reader ship with little or no i nvestment i n the discipline, the popular psychol ogist does not have to work hard to get our attention. Unlike cell biology or math ematic s, psychology does n't need to 10 be \"popul arised\" in t he sense of \"made attractive.\" Psychology is already a selli ng point for ot her materi al. As a discipline whose pri nciple focus is also its readership, psychology appe als to (and offers an explanat ory account of ) our nar cissism. A self-int erest ed audi ence seems guarant eed. There is, however, a downside to this attraction. When a populariser of cosmol ogy pr esents information as factual, the reader ship is (usually) in no positi on to co ntradi ct su ch claims (not, at least, from personal experience). The popular cosmologist i s not reall y competing with what we already know . The popularis er of psy chology , on the other hand, is writi ng on a subject about which everyone already f eels that they have ex pert k nowledge. Consciousness me ans tha t informati on about our minds is at all times ava ilable to us. If a psychologist makes a particular claim about human experi ence, we can (often) immediatel y check its vera city a gainst our o wn experience. All o f which m eans that the popular psychol ogist must pull off a clever trick: the question of how the mind wor ks must be answered in su ch a way that t here is no clear contradi ction wit h what the r eader alrea dy knows from their own experience, and yet with suffici ent no velty that the ma terial presented cannot be taken for simple commonsense.7 As a by-product of this prior intimacy with the subject-matter, th e type of knowl edge psychology produces has obvious utility value for the public. Lear ning that a star of a certai n size ma y coll apse int o a whit e-dwarf is not somethi ng that can be used in everyday life, but learni ng that there ar e typical physiologi cal 7 Accordingly, one of the f irst tasks is t o deflate the expertise of the audience. One of the most powerful and elegant solut ions to this p roblem was provided by Sigmund Freud. Recognising that \"man feels himself to be supreme within his own mind\" (Freud [1917] 1955, 141). Freud took it upon himself to p ersuade his audience th at things were not as they seeme d. His ingen uity here was the introdu ction of a w hole categor y of mental phenomena inaccessible t o the conscious mind. The so-called Unconsciou s was defined as just tha t sort of mental activity that is not registered by conscious awareness yet neverthe less exerts an affect ive power over behaviour. In addition, t he Unconsciou s was acce ssible only th rough what Freud called psychotherapy, and this in turn was a treatment that could only be performed by the trained (expert) psychotherapist. 11 responses indicative of certain mental states may be v ery useful indeed. There is a ver y large body of popula r instructional literature (loosely) based upon what psychol ogy can tell us about social behavi our, Dale Carnegi e's How To Win Fri ends and I nfluence People (1936) bei ng the paradigm ca se. As thi s last exampl e indicates, an additional obstacle for populari sation (in the pedagogi c mode) is the territorial overlap bet ween psychology as a nat ural science whose fo cus is t he human mind- brain, and psychiatry as a branch of medical scien ce whose ai m is t he diagnosis and treat ment of mental illnes s and distress . Cons equentl y, the domai n of popular psychol ogy i ntrudes upon the domain of therapeutic literature (\"self-hel p\" and \"well -being\").8 These conflations refl devel opment of the sci ence of psychol ogy in its pr esent form, and that the histor y of t he popularisation of psyc hology overlaps the development of those disciplines to their present form. Psychology contra Psychiatry In The Problem atic Science (Woodward and Ash, eds. 1982), a collection of essays about ps ychology 's struggle for disci plinary a utonomy during the nineteenth century, Willia m R. Woodward makes a useful distinction between being a science an d being a professi on (1982, 1-14). He does this because he wants to leave room for a professi onal psychology that is nonethel ess not ( yet) methodologically consistent with the sciences. That i s, psychol ogist s are recognised as havi ng particular 8 The differe nces betwe en Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus (1992) by John Gray PhD, and The Mating Min d (2000) by Geoffrey Miller, may not be immediately obvious: both offer a th eory of human relations conditional upon the existence of innate differ ences betw een the sexes. Miller's b ook, however, locates t he source of th ese differen ces in evolut ionary history, and is int ended as a work of educative popular scien ce writing; whereas Gray's book po sits no (seriou s) material cause for th e innate diff erences, an d is intende d as therape utic-instru ctional literatur e termi nological conventi ons whi ch are unique to their discipline, and whi ch set them ap art from doct ors, geographer s, carpenters (etc.), but wh ich nonetheless do not align them wit h such labor atory sciences as physi cs, biol ogy, and chemistry. W oodward's focus is t he emergence of psychology as a science - the pr ocesses by which it gr aduated from a philosophi co-medical study to a specifically scientific study of the human mi nd-br ain. In order to establish itself as a scientific study, psychology had to adop t the disi nterested position typical of sci entifi c disciplines. W hat was re quired for pr ofessionali sation and subsequent sci entisation was not necessarily a lin ear development from the ex isting folk -psyc hologies . This legacy of this evol ution over the past one hundred and fifty years (or so) is a series of speciation points as professi onal psychol ogy fr om fol k psycho logy, and develops in its place a professionalized version of practica l psychological advice. Psychiatry emerges as a disti nct (m edical, not academi c) field - the appl ication of psychological knowledge fo r the treatment of mental illness, by analogy with the doctor' s applicati on of phys iological knowledge for the treat ment of somatic illness. But psychiatry, as medic ine, does not need to poss ess explicit factual knowl edge in order to pr ogress: it is sufficient that the work of psychi atrists (like the work of doct ors) is efficacious in the treatment of ailments.9 So psychiatry is not simply applied psychology, it is al so whatever does the job of all eviating mental distress. As such, the 9 The experimental field of medicine is successfu l cures - th is is really the only criterion which matters, for it is manifest proof of the effica cy of medical knowledg e. As such, its scientif ic status, whilst re cognised an d acknowled ged, is prob ably (in terms of what attracts the r espect for medicine that people have) secondary to its utility. The same is surely true for engineering and agriculture, bot h of which are measured by different standards th an the scien ces which (t heoretically) underpin th em, namel y, physics and biology. Physicists and b iologist s gar ner an entir ely epistemological re spect. During the nineteenth a nd early twentieth centur y, psychologists la cked t he direct pro of of effica cy enjoyed by medicine, al though the materialist r ecognition t hat \"mental illness\" migh t have a somatic aetio logy is the theoretical found ation of the link between psychiatry and psychology. 13 requir ement that it be a strict scie nce is l ess shar p, and the r ole (and practical t oolkit) of the psychi atrist bears no ne cessary relation to the findings of (scientific) psychol ogy. T he scientisation of psychology, then, proceeds with or without the scientisati on of psychiatry.10 At any point along this history, what is under stood by (and what is meant by ) \"psy chology \" is in flux . These v arious vers ions of ps ychology are n ot successive, on e replacing the other, but multiple, one beside the other. Psychi atry br anches out from psychology, but both persist, and whilst practitioners of either psychi atry or psychology kn ow the difference between each other, the public may not.11 To popularis e psychology at the point when it was not clearly di stinguished from psychiatry will produce a ver y differ ent text, selecti ng different facts and presenting them in a manner suit able for addr essing different issues and answering different questions. How a doctor co mmuni cates medical information to a patient will be different from how a scientist communicates similar information. How a salesm an describes a technology will be different from how an engineer does. T he appearance of a \"popul ar psychology\" occurs during the period when these desc riptive vocabul aries overlap. The emer gence of psychology as a professional disci pline occurs when the techni cal complexity of psyc hology is such that the community of per sons able to comp rehend pronounc ement s from psychology is graduall y restrict ed to the set of per sons identified as prof essional 10 Hence Freud is reject ed from the canon of acad emic psychology quite early (eg, Joseph Ja strow in 1935 says, \"Freud has ignored the academic psycholog ists and the y have returned the compliment. They find his pre mises so un supported b y any naturalistic f oundations, his conclusions so viti ated by false logic, that most of them reject his structure completely\" [Jastr ow 1935, 266]. Nonetheless, Freudia n psychoanalysis remaine d a tool of th e practicin g psychiatrist. Like the doctor, the psychiatrist is pragmatic: use matters more than truth, and if it emerges that some practical b enefit can be wrought from an understanding of th e human mi nd-brain, th en so be it, but therapeutic application is by no mea ns the chief aim of psychology. 11 One commentator note s that \"[i]t is entirely possible that 19 30s editors did not kno w the difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist\" (Bur nham 1987, 99); although it seems a safe wager that even today most people would have an only vag ue idea. 14 psychologis ts: for the proc ess of professionalisati on and eventual scientisation al so marks a shif t in th e nat ure of the populari sed mat erial issued by psyc hologis ts, so a secondary effect of Woodwar d's distinct ion between professionalisation and scie ntisation (mention ed above) is to help to identify the point at which popularis ation bec omes more than abbreviati on - that is, the point at wh ich the prof essional language of the discipline' s practitioner s becomes (l argely ) incomprehens ible to non- specialists coincides with the point at whi ch that discipline has become scientific. The emer gence of ex perimental psyc hology in the 1890s, replacing the ol d \"sciences of t he mind\"12 and providing a pl atform from which to r eject or accept exi sting theo ries of mind s uch as phrenology or mesmerism, mark ed the inauguration of a new academic di scipline and therefor e a subject- matter requirin g (and capable of receivi ng) populari sation. At thi s point, the popularisatio n serves a se condary functi on: not just the dissemination of ideas, but also the translation of those ideas into a f orm that the (non- specialist) public can unders tand. So the popularis ation psyc hology was (relative to the populari sation of theoretical bi ology, for example) not because psychologists were unwillin g to popularise, but si mply because there was very little to announce that was not already known by the intelligent readi ng public. It is at this point that John Burn ham's contribution to this story begins . Burnham points out that \"for much of the ninet eenth cent ury it was not possible to popu larize psychol ogy. W hat psychology ther e was, 12 E. W. Scripture's expositions of the emerging discipline in Thinking, Fee ling, Doing (Scripture 1895), a successful popu larisation, an d his sub sequent technical work, The New Psychology (Scriptu re 1897), sh ow that exp erimental psychology wa s becoming distinct from philosophy of mind at the end of the nineteenth century. Lorraine Daston charts the p hilosophi cal positions un derpinning t his shift in \"The Theory of Will versu s the Science of Mind\" (Da ston 1982). 15 was common property among educat ed peopl e\" (Burnham 1987, 85).13 In other wor ds, until relativel y rece ntly, there was no thing sufficiently distinctive about psycholo gy that would warrant it s diffusion, nor anyt did a specialized experi mental psychol ogy begin to appear that was not al ready in the possession of the literate public, and t heref ore only then was there a psychology that could be popul arized\" (Bur nham 1987, 85). However, the emergence of the pr ofessional and disti nct discipli nes of psychol ogy and psychia try alongs ide the popular dissemi nation of each (both together and separatel y) has r esulted in a confused def inition of what counts as \" popular psycholog y.\" Because what \"psychology\" referred to included much of what is now psychiatr y, \"popul ar psychol ogy\" covers not only the popularisation of the science of psychology, but al so the popularisation of psychiatr y, ther apy, self-help, an d so- called su ccess literature. The impr ecision of t he vocabulary is su ch that a ny ver sion might be l abelled as \"popular psycho logy,\" an ambiguit y which conceals import ant differences bet ween the ai ms and effects of each mode. For this reason, it makes sense to dist inguish between the various sens es. What follows i s a basic typol ogy of po pular psychologies, so as to clarif y these senses. A basic t ypology of popul ar psy chologies 1. na\u00efve / homespun / folk psychology The \"homespun wi sdom\" of the folk psychologist is of little concern here, but is mentioned as it fo rms the background against which the other two categories define t hemsel ves. Folk psychology refers 13 He goes on to add that \"Technical p sychology would at most have been a subfield within philosophy. It was not until sp ecialized, distinctive, scientific p sychology came along at the end of the century that psychology could be tran slated, cond ensed, and simplified fo r lay people.\" (Burnham 1987, 85) 16 to the theory of mind that people have prior to seri ous investigatio n. It is untutored knowledge which defines itself in oppos ition to academi c book-lear ning and to la boratory experiment, but which has shown itself thr ough experienc e to be effective advice. The product of acquired folk know ledge is pr actical wisdom. The theor etical element i s mini mal, and i mplicit. Instead, folk psychology is entirel y about the di spensation of useful advi ce, it is entirel y pragmatic. It has no need for theories which have no applicati on (e.g., the \"problem\" of consciousness is no such thing).14 There is consensus in folk psychology , but the knowledge is per son-centred ( embod ied) rather than ext ernally codified in books (di sembodied). Also, it is matriarchal and maternal - a valence fl eshed out in the figur e of the \"Agony Aunt \" who offers folk wisdom to readers i n newspaper s and ma gazines. Folk psychol ogy marks out a continuum from gr andmotherly ad vice at one end to quasi-pr ofessional advi ce at the other. Charac teristically, a psychologi cal theory underlies the fo lk wisdom, it will not be explicitly invoked. Official qualif ications are c oncealed, and adv ice is offered horizont ally (that is, as between per sons of equal st atus and lear ning). Wher e the di spensers of su ch ad vice begin to display official titles, the mate rial qualifies as therapeutic psychology . 14 Some of the tenets of a folk psychology rely on metaphorical devices which have also appear ed in various incarnatio ns of tec hnical psycholo gy: the hydraulic theory, for example, which views \"pressure\" as \"building up \" unless you \"let it out.\" Such theories attribute to p sychological phenomena the properties of decomposing orga nic matter. As if the \"accumulation\" of \"bad\" thoughts was st rongly analogous to the accumulatio n of necrotic t issue and eq ually likely t o lead to more generalised poisonin g unless the toxins are removed. As if \"talking abo ut it\" was in some sense a (physical) \"release.\" Whilst we re cognise the inaccuracy of such lang uage, nonet heless, ther apy is predicated o n just su ch a claim to th is day. 17 2. therapeutic \" pop-\" psychol ogy (self-help) The category of ther apeutic lit erature is ver y broad, and most of what is usually referred to as \"popular psychol ogy\" would be included here. C uriously, ver y few of th e auth ors ar e psych ologists, but a considerable number ar e (or were) psychiatrists. What passes for \"popular psycholo gy\" could us ually be better characterised as popular psychiatry. There is a broad spectrum of material here, from na\u00efve psyc hology up to profes sional psy chiatry . Some of what is oft en called sp iritual literature would also be cover ed under this heading where the psychiatric bl urs int o the religio-phil osophical (Buddhi sm, Taoism, and so on). Some fictionalised material might al so be included (for example, The Celestine Prophecy [1994] and its seque ls). The overwhel ming majority of this catego ry, howev er, is occupied by \"self-help\" or \"success\" literature - books whic h offer advice for living based upon (and usually supported by) ps ychiatric practi ce, but designed to be performed by the reader within their own life, without the need for professional counselling. Alth ough they might seem to risk leaving their authors redu ndant (assuming, that is, they still function as pr actisi ng psychi atrists and th erapi sts), these books i nstead seem to sustain respect for the pr ofession they represent - trading upon and reinfor cing the category of psychological or psychi atric expertise. This is bolstered by academi c qualificati ons, whi ch - even if inappropriate - are pr ominently displayed, f urther legitimis ing the include: , Ph.D, Robert E. Hardy, Ph.D (1991) Self-Def eating Behavior s: Free Your self from the Habit s, Com pulsions, Feeli ngs, and Attitudes That Hol d You Back ; Penelope Russinoff Ph.D's (1988) When Am I Going t o Be Happy? : How t o Break the Em otional Bad 15 Selected at random from Amazon.com, searching by \"self-help.\" 18 Habits That Make You Mi serable; or Dr Arthur Fr eeman' s (1992) 10 Dum best Mistakes Sm art People Ma ke and How To Avoid Them : Simple and Sure Techniques for Gaining Greater Control of Your Life. In addition to the academic titles , the book titles here ar e quite typical - t he emphasis i s on reader participati on. The direct address will be em ployed and read ers are encouraged to perform thought experiment s and exercises. This i s instructi onal literature. The canonical self- help bo ok is Dal e Carnegi e's How T o Win Friends and Influenc e People ([1936] 1982) a phr ase which - like Dupont's \" Better Li ving Through Ch emistry\" - has come to achieve aphoristi c status. The nineteenth - and early-twentieth-centur y predec essor to s elf-help was what is sometimes called \"mental hygiene\" - this bei ng the mai ntenanc e of mental health through psychology. Although there ar e styl istic ch anges, the m odern self- help publications can be seen as the desc endants of the earlier mental hygiene texts. 3. popularisation of (scientific) psychol ogy The popul arisati on of the science of psychology is i ntended to be educative and edif ying, setting itself against the therapeutic materi al offered as \" popular psyc hology\" and prefer ring to align itself with n other words, the populari sation of psychology i s a token of popular science writing, not a token of popul ar psychol ogy (hence the awkward terminological overlap). Populari sations of psychology will discuss more theoretic al material, c ondens ing and s implify ing ac ademic psychology. Of course, this will involve many of the sa me su bject headings as can be foun d within the therapeutic lit eratur e, including memor y, sexuality, vi olence, stre ss, and so on, but in terms of 19 theori es about how the br ain responds to cert ain stimuli. Additionally, there wi ll be much on topics whi ch are rarely touched upon by therapeuti c or folk psycho logy: vision, co nsciousness, the physi cal st ructur e of the brain, the evol ution of cognition, and so on. The parti cipator y element is mi nimal or absent altogether, and there i s little in the way of expli cit practical advice on how to apply the lessons of psychology to lif e. Information is dispensed top- down, which is to say, the writer is an expert (or has access to expertise) that qualifies them to pronounce aut horitativel y as represent atives of t he sci ence they are describi ng. That being said, unlike the promi nently di splaye d academic and pr ofessional qualific ations appended to author's names in th e self-help books, in the popularisation of the science of psychology , titles are rar ely if ever empl oyed. In keeping with vernacular designat ion, I will refer to the first of these categories as \" folk psychol ogy,\" the second as \"popular psychology,\" and the third as \"popular isations of psychology.\" A typol ogy like thi s does not purport to identify absolute and immutabl e categori es (it descri bes the situati on as it stands - t hese categor ies woul d not be so recognisable in 1900 as they were in 2000). Instea d, it is intended to under score the differences between th e various activ ities and prac tices included by the ext ension of \"popul ar ps ychology ,\" and in recognising this, to acknowl edge that what is a usef ul or appr opriat e in the cont ent and style of a text will be dependant upon the broa der intentions of its author. That sai d, this patt ern of di vision is repeated to some degree elsewhere. F or example, what is called \"popular astronom y\" refers not of Creation by Marcus Chown [1996]), but rather to amateur star- gazing - advi ce on where and when partic ular c elestial phenomena will be v isible, and what 20 type of equipment you will need to see them (eg, The Backyar d Astronom er's G uide by and Al an Dyer [2002]). At the non-academi c (that is, folksy) end, astrol ogy offer s a ver sion of the universe into which humans more sn ugly fit, re-pers onalising c traditi on of decen tring. As with psychology, it is possible to separat e out the theoretical-educ ative from the utilitarian- instructional mat erial, and from both of these, the superstitious-folk belief, where little or no trace of the scienc e can be found. Common to these typol ogies is a conti nuum of theori es (astrology, folk ipatory the s elf-help book , the amateur as tronomy book , the field guide to Bri tish birds. Stephen Hilgartner (199 0) argues that keeping t he amat eur and the professional domai ns (con spicuousl y) separat e is actuall y one way of creating and sustaining re spect for the scientist s whose work i s being populari sed. In critici sing the so-call ed dominant vi ew of popularisation,16 Hilgartner sees a separati on betwee n expert and popular chos en les s for its de scriptive a ccuracy tha n for its strat egic value for scie nce. By enfor cing a strict (but actually unmar ked) divisi on between popular science and sci ence pro per, those with an inter est in maintaining the power of science can do so by expl oiting the presti ge added to sci ence by populari sation - pr oper science is in accessible to non- scientists, which (as Hil gartner puts it ) \"buttresses th e epistemic authority of scientists agains t challenges by outs iders\" (Hil gartner 1990, 530). So t he less the reader feels able to parti cipate, the more intelligen t the scientist seems. 16 The so-called dominant view is \"the idealized n otion of pure, genuine scientific knowledge against which popularize d knowledg e is contra sted\" (Hilgartner 1990, 519). It is not ent irely clear this really was the dominant view (even i n 1990), but it does provide a stable target f or criticism. 21 Loosely, t his correl ates with t he familiar SSK argument that \"distance lends enchantment\" (e.g., Coll ins 1992, 145). Whilst it is worth bei ng awar e of how the professi onal scienti st can choose to sel ectively remin d an audience of his or her status in order to secure privileges, it ought to be clea r that stories about the difficulty of science ar e not simply a publi c relation s exerci se designed to make scientists appear more cl ever than they really are: sci ence, like mo st all professions, is al so very difficu lt and achievi ng a good level of compr ehensi on requires a commensurat e amount of study. The popular- professional boundary, ho wever fuzzy, records a su bstantiv e differenc e in content: Edward Witt en's technical paper s on string theor y are inaccessib le to no n-physicists (e.g., Wi tten 2004). Thi s is nei ther a ruse nor a rhet orical trick. The ver y act of popularisation it self exi sts as a response to just this sort of technical complexity. In light of this, it is worth noting that certai nly the third categor y mentioned above, and some of the second, ar e hist orically new, inasmuch as the ex istence of a psyc hology that requir ed popular translati on di d not really exi st until the early twenti eth centur y. The type of popul arisation Bur nham is principally co ncerned with is this third category, and the dec line in quality he detects in the populari sation of psychology invol ves slippage into the former category, along with the evaporation of any th eoretical framework within which the materi al might be usefully presented. The stor y is one Bur nham repeat s for each of the fields of sci ence and health popularisation he encount ers - initial popularisations are involved and intelligent (he cites E. W. Script ure's 1895 Thinking, Feeling, Doing as especially commendable [Burnham 1987, 89]17), but the general quality of such materi al gradually decays: 17 Although Thinking, Fee ling, Doing sold 20,000 copies during its first five weeks of publication (Burnham 19 87, 89), it is not clear tha t Scripture's fellow profe ssionals were 22 By mi d-century, the very nature of public izing ps ychology had changed significantly. ... [L]ong, syst les in es sentially high- culture magazines ... al most disappeared. Instead the styl e of jour nalism predominat ed... and it was in this contex t that the results rather than the proces s of doing psychol ogy wer e emphasi zed. Moreover, these resu lts were presented in short, interesting snippet s unrelat ed to one another but widel y distributed. (Burnham 1987, 105) His co mplaint contin ues: \"Th oughtful pieces, howev er, r estricted to pr ofess//si onal or very highbrow outlet s. the semioffici al popularizations of Sci ence Servi ce at no time confronted basic problems at length\" (105-1 06). The result of this was the \"fragmenti ng of popularizations so th at each res ult ... was not c onnec ted to psyc hology as a whole\" (109). Ultimately, as fo r health and the nat ural sciences, populari sation co nsisted of not hing mor e than facts, such that \"[b]y the 1960s and 1970s , the large volume of popularized ps ychology ... embrac ed no great themes \" (115). By the mid-1980s, all that remained was \"the b its-an d-pieces strat egy of presenting sci ence\" (Bur nham 1987, 234). In an age where attenti on spans had been clip ped by \"tel evision's relentless promotion of so- called en tertainment\" (Burnham 1987, 235), Burnham contends that th e qualitative decline in the popularis ation of science would conti nue inexor ably. The tone at the end of his book is elegiac: though there \"wer e still a few\" science popularisers willing to provide r eaders wit h detailed exposi tions and of sci ence were swamped\" (261) by \"narrow technicians without a callin g\" (262). Burnham closes with the so impresse d: a contemporary reviewer is dispa raging of Scripture's ina bility to clarif y his terms, concluding: \" Let us devoutly hope that Dr. Scripture will never write a dictionary\" (Washburn 6 60). 23 melodramatic cont ention th at \"sci ence probably di d not exi st any l onger on the popular level. Superstit ion di d\" (262). That he cho oses to ca st this projecti on in the past tense is significant, indicating that he thin ks a return to the \"old values\" is improbabl e. The man of science was a nineteenth c entury phenomenon, an impossible anachronism in t he hyper-specialised late twentieth centur y. But onl y a few year s after the publication of How Super stition Won (1987), Burn ham's p essimism see ms mispla ced. Th e populari sation of the natural sc iences, and es pecially the popularisation of the science of psychology, seems t o have undergon e exactly the type of renai ssance Burnham thought prohibiti vely unlikely. A car eful reading of one recent a nd successful popularisation of psychology , Stev en Pink er's How T he Mind Works (1997), reveals that (super venient) theor etical orientation i s a disti nctive characteristic of th e modern popularisation of psychology. An analysi s of the ways i n which Pinker int erpolates fact s and t heories (in comparison wit h earlier versi ons of popul arised psychology) reveal s an awareness of the vari ous level s of popularisation, and an advanced ab ility to switch between levels of techni cality and mai ntain a consi stent position with respect to the theory upon which the facts are predi cated. PART II Stev en olutionary ) chology A successful academic, Pi nker found popular accl aim with t he publicati on, in 1995, of The Language Instinct , a lengthy exposition of the consequences of Chomsky's t heory of Universal G rammar. The Language Instinct was al most uni versally praised for its humour and expositor y clarity. Pi nker's success with The Language Instinct led to a 24 further publishi ng deal for a book that expl ored t he wider consequences of the neuroscientific and evolutionar y perspecti ve from which The Language Instinct had been written. Introduci ng How The Mi nd W orks, Pinker makes it clear that this is to be thought of not as a new direction (that is, from the narr ow field of linguistics to the much more i nclusive subject matter of psychol ogy), but simpl y as a continuation of the previous work : \"There is no c hapter on language. My prev ious book The Language Instinct covers the topi c in a complementary way\" ( Pinker 1997, x).18 As far as Pink er is conc erned, the argument of How T he Mind Works is a conclusion that follows naturally from The Language Instinct : those who agreed with the first book (and most revi ewers se emed to) would logicall y agr ee with the second. Unfort unately, this wa s not to be the case. How The Mind Wor ks met with much har sher critici sm than Pinker's prev ious book . The Language Instinct was relatively mode st in scope, but How The Mi nd Works was much more ambitious . How The Mind Wor ks was widely perceived as reducti onist and simp listic, despite employing t he same philosophi cal and scientif ic foundations as The Language Ins tinct. Most of the reviewers found fault with sp ecifics. Typical is Jo hn Du pr\u00e9 (revi ewing the book for Philosophy of Sci ence) who, after first praising Pinker's expertise in linguistics, describes How The Mi nd Wor ks as \"going rat her beyond these di sciplinary specializations\" (Dupr\u00e9 1999, 489), and finds Pinker writ ing on subject s in which he is insuffic iently expert: \"In s ome cases, Pin ker evidently un derstands, and explains, t he science well; in other cases, even ap art from the embarr assing ve ntures into aes thetics and phil osophy in the final chapter, it 's not obv ious he knows what he is 18 As Pinker e xplains in his online bio graphical sketch: \" The L anguage Instinct was an introduction to all aspe cts of languag e, held toget her by the idea that lang uage is a biologica l adaptation. This was follow ed in 1997 b y How the Mind Works , which offere d a similar synthesis of the rest of the mind, from vision and re asoning to t he emotions, humor, and art.\" (from: 1999, 489). He co ncludes that \"The end result does not begi n to justify t he book' s ambitiou s title\" (Dupr \u00e9 1999, 493). Literar y reviewer s enjoyed the sections on br ain functioni ng, but found the value- free account of art and literat ure weak ( one criti c said Pi nker had \"the literary and judgement ... of an undergraduat e\"19).Meanwhile, behavioural scienti sts admired the ma nner in er ex plained how the ster eogram i mages wo rked, but criticised hi s account of human excessi vely general.20 Antici pating critici (and consequently too general), Pinker inserts a di sclaimer on t he first pages: Any book calle d How T he Mind Work s had better begin on a note of humility, and I will begi n with two. First, we don't unders tand how the mind wo rks - not nearly as well as we under stand how t he body works, and certainl y not well enough to desi gn ut opia or to cu re unhappiness . why the audacious title? The lingui st Noam Chomsky on ce suggested that our ignor ance can be di vided i nto problems and mysteries. When we face a problem, we may not know its soluti on, but we have insight, inc reasing k nowledge, an d an inkling of what we are looking for. When we face a myster y, however, w e can only star e in wonder and bewi lderment, not knowi ng what an expl anation would even l ook li ke. I wrote th is book because dozens of mysteries of the mind, from mental images to romantic love, have recently been upgraded to pr oblems (though th ere still some mysterie s, too!). Eve ry ide a in th e book may turn out to be wrong, but that would be pr ogress, becau se our old i deas were too vapid to be wr ong. (Pinker 1997, ix) What Pinker is offering the reader here is presented as a prov isional answer, couched in terms of what we don't know r ather than what we do. 19 The complaint runs: \"His literary taste and judge ment seem t hose of an undergraduate who is e xtraordinarily bright but who is much more sensit ive to computers than to poems, plays, or novels\" (Carroll 1998, 47 9). 20 Richard Dawkins is ad miring of Pinker's explan ation of ster eoscopy, referring readers How The Min d Works and adding: \"I won't even try to better his explanation\" (Dawkins 1998, 278). 26 The emphasi s is on degree s of ignorance - but he' s not clai ming t hat everyone is equally wrong. So for everything \"we may not know\" we still have \"incr easing knowledge.\" It's not altogether cl ear which groups the inclusi ve pronoun cover. T he \"we\" who admit at the outset that they don't under stand how the mind works are Pinker an d his professional colleagues. Th e \"we\" who star e at m ysteries in \"w onder and bewilder ment\" pr ofessio nals and lay-r eaders alike. And the we who hol d the \"ol d ideas\" ar e everyo ne exc ept ionals concur wit h Pinker. By \"our ol d ideas\" he means folk psychology and what Burnham would call super stition, and it is this resi dual belief structure t hat the book aims to update. It must b e stressed t hat what Pinker wants to do in How The Mind Works is replace the v arious theories of mind (in both the public domai n and within academi c psychol ogy) wit h one coherent theor y of mind. What he want s to achieve is a whol esale repl acement of the existi system s with a m onistic an d scientifically credible system, namely, that of evolutionary psychology. To this end, along with being a complement ary volu me to The Language Ins tinct, How T he Mind Works is also a complement ary volume to E. O. Wilson's Consilience (publi shed a year lat er in 1998), to Matt Ridley's Origin of Virtue (1998), to Helena Cr onin' s The Peac ock and the Ant (1993), and (in a l ess populist, though by no means inaccess ible form) to the work of the ts Leda Co smides and John Toob y, notably their 1992 collection, The Adapted Mi nd. Pink er acknowledges his debt to T ooby and Cosmides at the start of How T he Mind Works ,21 and woul d later contribut e a positive review of Wilson's Consilience .22 How The Mind 21 \"I have intellectual debt s to many ... but most of all to Joh n Tooby and [19 94] 1995, x; and the dedication in The Blank Slate , which is to \" Don[ald m/id/3057/ (at 2006). 27 Works relies heavil y on refer ences from fellow evolutionary psychologists . This type of mutual co nsistency i s one of the tenets of evolutionary psychology , it is the s ame one-s ize-fits-all approach that Wil son had employed in Consilience (his attempt to unify the di scipline s). It is also the hallmark of the incl usive (or reductioni st) attitude of Tooby and Cosmides, ual Bark Cosmides , and T ooby 1992, 4) and maint ain that by f ollowing this program the humanities and social sciences will enjo y the type of theoreti cal consistency across scales typi cal of the natur al sciences. The downs ide to conc eptual integr ation is the hier archy arbitrat e what the lower disciplines can legitimately say. What this means in practice is that proposing \"a psychol ogical conc ept that is incompat ible with evolutionary biology i s as pr oblematic as proposin g a chemi cal reaction that viol ates the laws of physics\" (in Bar kow, Cosm ides, and Tooby 1992, 4). In other words, for a psychol ogical cl aim to be valid, it must be checked not just against physical possibility, but also against adaptive plausibility. In their essay \"The Psyc hologic al Foundations of Culture\" (in and Tooby 1992, 19 -136), Tooby and Cos mides lay out something of a manifest o for evoluti onary psychology . Their title should make clear how such thi nkers co nceive of cultu re as a product of hum an psychology (and not the ot her way ar ound). In turn, they believ e that psyc hology is inextricabl e from evolutionar y histor y. It is important to set How The Mind Wor ks in the wider cont ext of these wor ks. Together, t hey constitute a claim on the popular imagination - they for m a mutually reinf orcing bel ief system. Pinker is consonant with E. O. Wilson, Wil son is consonant wi th Richard Dawki ns (1998), Dawki ns is consonant with Matt Ridley . Open almost any page of How T he Mind Works, and there wil l be some word of support for the evol utionary psychologic al pos ition being pus hed: 28 The ultimate goal that the mi nd was desi gned to attain is maximising the number of copies of the genes that created it. (Pinker 1997, 43) ...our understanding of how t he mind works will be woefully incomplete or downright wro ng unless it mesh es with our under standing of how the mi nd ev olved. (Pinker 1997, 174) In evoluti onary a man wh o has a short-term liai son is betting that his illegi timate child will surv ive on its own or is counting on a cuckol ded husband to bring it up as his own. (Pinker 1997, 476) As far as Pink er is conc erned, the equali ty of m ankind is a natural (and scientifical ly verifiabl e) consequence of the equality of human minds . The human mi nd, as Tooby and Cosmides put it, is always and everywhere the same. Repeatedl y, Pink er ma kes reference to the u niversality of hi s concl usions - t he following quotations issue from a single page: \"people in all societies... . And peopl e ever ywhere... . We will soon see that all people... . We are al l... . Thanks to t hese inborn talents, we...\" (Pinker 1997, 301). Tacking away fr om a direct expl anation of ment al functi on, he even includes a chapter on human evol ution (\"Revenge of the Ner ds\" which c oncludes by saying: \"nothing in culture makes sense except in the light of psychology. Evolution created psychology, and that is how it explains culture. The most important rel ic of early humans is the modern mi nd\" (Pinker 1997, 210). The for mulation here i s exactl y as pr escribed by Tooby and Cos mides' essay, \"The Psyc hologic al Foundations of Cult ure.\" Throughout the book, and especiall y towar ds the end, th e term \"adapted mind\" is used interchangeably wit h \"mind.\" There i s little evi dence of a psychological vocabul ary distinct f rom the vocabu lary of evolutionar y development because ( as far as Pinker is concer ned) there is no way of t alking about the mi nd that is not also talk about evolution. What the reader comes to 29 realise is t hat what promot es itself as a book about general psychol ogy is actually a book about ev olutionary psychology . It is in this sense that Pinker's How The Mind Wor ks stands as a case agai nst Burnham' s pessi mistic view of the popularisation of psychology. Again, as mentioned bef ore, the intention here is not to suggest that Burnham wa s wrong when he wr ote How Superstition Won , rather that the popul arisati on of ps ychology (and perhaps the populari sation of sci ence mor e generally ) has undergone a mark ed devel opment si nce the time he was writ ing. Pinker' s style of pr esentati on is a relatively new phenomena , and one whi ch Burnham would presumably welcome. T he popularisati on of psychology was not al ways so su ccessful in pr esenting a unifie d picture of the discipline - nor di d it always have such a clea r candidate for a theor y capable of performing such a uni ficatio n. A tidy comparison pr esent s itself here wi th another version of How The Min d Wor ks - this one published some sixty year s earlie r, in 193 3, and compiled by the then -comparably famous (and now somewhat more notori ous)23 psychologist, Cyril Burt. A samp le of tw o is o bviously too narrow a data set to allow for definitive conclusions, but this com parison shoul d be suffici ent to give a se nse of the ways in whi ch the populari sation of psychology has dev contras t to Burnham's 23 Burt's notor iety is an un fortunate bu t ultimately irrelevant issue here. The charges brought against him after his death - that he fabricated experimental evidence in studies of th e correlation of intelligen ce in set s of identical twins - relate t o events that occurred much later than the composition and pu blication o f his version of How The Mind Works (1933)(which in case m akes no mention of twin studies) an d have recently been re-examined in lig ht of the pro duction of very similar but indisputa bly legitimate results obta ined by Davi d Lykken's t eam at Minn esota, and Pinker's ow n team in Harvard. Th at Pinker an d Burt share this resear ch interest an d theoretical position on the inheritan ce of mental characterist ics is interesting, especially as Pinker makes no mention whatsoever of Burt in any of his sever al books, ev en those ( How The Min d Works , The Blank Slate ) whose cont ent bears dir ectly upon twin studies. There is scope here t o examine t he treatment of soiled re putations an d scandals by popular writers looking to assure an increasingly sc eptical public that science is legitimate - however, it is not something that falls within the scope of this paper. (Fo r discussion of Burt's reput ation, see N . Burt: Fraud or Framed? ) 30 pessimistic view of it s ine vitable decline; cle aving away from wh at is n ow popular psychol ogy and moving to a posi tion where (agai n, albeit controversially) it is able to claim th eoretic al harmony with the wider field of the natural sc iences. A Short Comparison: Burt and Pinker At the time How The Mind W orks (1933) was publis hed, Cy ril Burt was Chair of Psychology at Uni versity Col lege, London, a position he would hol d until hi s retirement in 1950. This was a hig hly esteemed pos t (Robert Joynson describes it as \"e ffectively the top job in British psychology \" [Joynson 1989, 11]), and in addition to this professional achievement, Burt' s publi c standing was such that he was knighted in 1946 (one year, inci dentally, after the second editi on of How T he Mind Works [(1933) 1945] was produced). There can be little doubt that at the time Burt put the book toget her, and for some time a fterwards, he was a promi nent figure in ( at least Br itish) psychology . Similarly , Pinker's own How The Mind Wor ks (1997) was written when he was Prof essor of Brain and Cogni tive Sciences and the direct or of the McDonnell-Pew Cent er for Cognitive Neurosci ence at MI T (199 4-1999). Bot h men are high st atus psychologis ts writing books explaining the stat e of their art for a general readershi p. Owing to pres s coverage and it's comparatively r ecent publ ication, Pinker's book is (relativ ely) well known t o moder n audiences (see Cassi dy 2005). It appears that Burt's How The Mi nd Wor ks ([1933] 1945), enjoyed similar popular success: it wa s republished in a second edition after the war (1945), and ran through several impressions (until at least 31 1948).24 But although Burt's book was described as \"stimulating\" in one very brief r eview (Gr oves 1934, 311), it seems that, like the reaction to Pinker's book , the ac adem ic community were more sceptical. In a revi ew disparaging of sever al other popular works, L. L. Bernar d, wri ting in The American Journal of Sociology (1938), ranked Burt' s book low: \"Even l ess useful [than the ot her books reviewed here] is How The Mind Wor ks. I am convi nced that minds do not work in the manner describ ed in this recent addition to the mythology of dominant instincts\" (Bernard 1938, 659). As if to emphasi se the fractur ed nat ure of the disci pline it represent ed, Burt's How The Mind Wor ks ([1933] 1945) was ac tually a multi-aut hored composite, adapted from a series of talks given for the BBC by hi mself and by fell ow psyc hologists Er nest Jones, Emmanuel Miller, and William Moodie. It is unclear if this is a selection Burt has made, or one thrust upon hi m by the BBC, for the authors have such different approaches to psychology t hat it becomes difficult to define where the boundaries of ps ychologi cal work should be drawn. It is also worth noti ng that of the f our contributor s, only Burt would be considered a psychologis t today - Jones was a ps ychoanal yst, and bot h Moodie and Miller were psychiatrists. By the time Pinker is writing, the distinction between therapeutic and sci entific psyc hology is sufficiently sharp that most readers will not be ex pecting his version of How The Mind Works (1997) to i nclude in structional materi al.25 Burt, on the other hand, was writing at a time when the dist inctio n between psyc hology and psy chiatry was less clear. 24 Published first as BBC pamphlet, subtitled \"A Series of Talks Broadcast on Tuesdays, From 27th Se ptember to 13th De cember, 1932.\" Subsequently by Allen a nd Unwin, London in 1933, 1945, 1948. 25 Although th at said, a magazine was launched in the UK in October 2005 called Psychologie s [as opposed to \"Psychiatries\"], offe ring a combination of int eractive questionnair es and psychological ex planation for the results - all of which blurs the distinct ion some more. 32 Burt a nd the Scientisation of Psy chology In the early 1930s, it was not clear to the public if psychology was a medical or an academic di scipline, nor was it clear to what extent psychology was identifiab le with philosophy of mi nd and intr ospection. One of Bu rt's tasks wa s to cl arify these positions, and to insist on the import ance and autonomy of psych ological re search. In editorial terms, here was where Bur t was abl e to infl uence the reader's sense of where psychology was going. Between the Freudian-therapeutic and empirical- neurological directions, hi s pre ferences see m quite clear, as can be seen in the following passage: Modern ci vilisati on is based on scie nce; and it is our belief, if that civilisation is to cont inue, scientific thinking must be applied to man as well as t o inani mate natur e. The met hods that have revolutionised agriculture, indust ry, medicine, and war, must be adopted for the study of ourselves - of the indivi dual, the family, the nation, and the race. Alread y psychology i s begi nning to affect us at many different points. Its di scoveries are bein g employ ed by teac hers, doc tors, and men of business, in their own partic ular fields . Educ ational means by whi ch we tr ain the ch ild // at school; vocational psychology will soon be decidi ng his future occupation and career; indus trial psyc hology is introducing more efficient methods into factories, wo rkshops and mines ; medical psychology is diagnos ing, and finding how to cure, the most terrible affl ictions of all - those of the mentally diseased. And the plain man at last has start ed to inquire, what is this novel, self- styled sci ence of whi ch he is hearin g so much? Is i t quacker y? Is it a fad? O r is it just sheer comm on sense? (Burt [1933]1945, 7-8) This is onl y prefatory material, of course, so B urt moves qui ckly over these points, without dwelling on any specifics, but nonetheless leaving us with the sense that psychology is doing grea t things. When we look again, we realise that these claims ar e carefully limited and conditional on the tense of the ver b. Psychology and its practitioner s \"are being 33 and finding how to cure.\" Psychology is dynamic and pr ogressive, but its actual achievement s are ap parently slight. The not ably sluggis h part amid this swift progress is Plain Man, w ho onl y now \" at last has st arted to inquir e.\" But despite this tardi ness, Plain Man is pr esumably a forward- looking c haracter, for he is expected to be impressed by the study's potential. The emphasi s is all on th e future value of psyc hology . Burt was t rying t o convi nce hi s audi ence that a scientific psychology was both poss ible and desir able. He makes us aware that he knows we have our doubts (\"I s it quackery?\" wonders Plain Man), but wants to persuade us that psycholo gy is important . This was done (in part) by establi shing psychol ogy's cl aim to be a global st udy. Education, medicine, business - all woul d be (or are even i n the pr ocess of being) affect ed by psychol ogical insi ghts. In short, whatev er people do they do with their minds, and as psychology is that discip line which studies minds, psychology will therefore be indispensa ble for the modern age - which is, we ar e reminded, a sci entifi c age. This i s briskl y establishe d by way of a n appealingl y neat argument to t he effect that the ad vance of modern civilisation can be measur ed by technological so phistication, and that technol ogical sophi stication, in turn, is a product of scientific thinking, therefor e, sci entific t hinking i s the driving forc e behind the advanc ement of modern civilisation. Ha ving established that psychology is almost universally applicable to the modern age and that modernit y is \"based on science,\" t he next step w as to stre ss th e scientific character of the study. In part, this had been facilitated already with the introduction of Plain Man, creating a divi sion betw een public and pr ofessional and making room for a category of psyc hological expertise above and beyond what we already, int uitively or th rough experience, knew of t he mi nd (recall that one of Pl ain M an's concerns i s that psychology may be no more than \"s heer common s ense\"). Psychologis ts would soon be the expert-sci entist s of the human mind - and as if to reinforce the 34 import ance of this enterpri se, Burt went on to clai m that \"The proper study - indeed the inevit able st udy - of m ankind is man\" (Burt [1933] 1945, 8). To further disarm charges that psychology was no more than c ommon sense, Burt relied on analogies wi th the physical sc iences: \" Common sense alone will no more enable us to fathom th e mysteries of the human consciousness than it has he lped us to solve the pr oblems of the atom or the st ar\" (Burt [1933] 1945, 8). The os tensive purpose was si mply to show how inexpert intuition is too blunt a tool to perform a ll tasks, but the analogy is deliberately bu ndled up with and rei nforces connec tions to the sciences: intuition an d common sense obviously couldn't h elp the physical sciences, and they cannot much help psychology, either, for it was as much a sci ence as physi cs. Further emphas ising the char acter of psychol ogical resear ch (and bringing Pl ain Man up to date), Burt stressed that psychology had \"changed from a bran ch of philosophy into a branch of experimental sci ence\" (Burt [1933] 1945, 8), with la most e were \"l atest hypot heses\" from biology, and the \"most rigorous devices for checking the truth of hi s data\" - these last bei ng somewhat unlikely borrowings from ma thematics (Burt [1933] 1945, 9; the \"devices\" i n question were presumabl y statistical tools, rat her than physi cal ones). The superlati ve character of these (only vaguely d escrib ed) research to ols w as importa nt, as were the ir origins i n the hard sciences: if psychol ogy was able to employ the same tools as the hard sciences, t hen sur ely psychol ogy wa s the same type of stud y. But Burt's efforts to make the discipline appe ar rigidly scienti fic were undercut by the ma terial contributed by th e other authors. Becaus e Miller, Moodie, and Jones were practi sing psychiatrists, their material tended towards the instructional. In terms of the t one and purpose of 35 Burt's book , this produc es some c onfusion between the desc riptive and the didac tic. Those sec tions which ar e explicitly instru ctional (offering practical advice to the readership on such matte rs as rai sing a chil d) frequentl y rely on di spensi ng pr actical adv ice supported not by experimental data but by normative clai ms and an ecdotal ev idence. T his is typical of psychiatry (as a discipline st eered by pragmatism: by utility rather than epistemology), but jars with Burt's clai ms for co nsistency with the natural s ciences, where normative claims are anathema. The mat erial in Emanuel Miller's sections on \"P roblems in the De velopment of the Child\" demons trate this : For example, a child who i s taught in an unemotio nal manner to eat in a clean wa y and at regular interval s, will not be the child with food fads. But if the child is made to tak e his meals in the midst of his play, when he is enjoying the pleasur es of spontaneous activity, he will be inc lined to have dyspeptic ill health... ...error s of this ki nd lead to false associations in the simple but direct mind of the child, which will create faulty attitudes in later life. (Miller in Burt [1933] 1945, 121-122) Miller concludes that \"the mother is herself to blame. ... A great deal of re-education will be necess ary to correct these init ial mistakes\" (Miller in Burt [1933] 1945, 122-123). Burt Pinker: The Assi k Psy chology s of instr discour se that Pinker' s generati on of psychologi sts see themselves in opposition to. At first blush, it might seem that Pi nker's views on par enting are equally didactic: A parent shoul d transfer investment from an older child to a younger one when the benefit to the younger exceeds the cost to the ol der. The reckoning i s based on the fact that t wo childr en are 36 equally rel ated to t he parent. But these calcul ations are from the parent's point of view; the first child sees it differently. ... The tensi on is called par ent-offspri ng confli ct. (Pinker 1997, 441) It is appar ent that \" should\" here plays a ver y differ ent role than it did in Burt's book : the normative forc e is not soc ial, but s tatistical. The normative element present in much of the writing fr om Burt's How The Mind Wor ks ([1933] 1945) is (almos t) entir ely absent from Pi nker's. He later underlines that no rmative terms are being us ed in a very limited sense: When I use terms like \"sho uld,\" \"best,\" and \"opt imal,\" they will be a shorthand for the stra tegies that would have led t o reproductive success in that world [i.e., the Pleistocene savannah]. I will not be referring to what is morally right, attainable in the modern world, or conduci ve to happiness, whi ch are menti on thes e debates not to ta ke a side but to call attenti on to the long reach of the parent-offspring conflict\" (Pinker 1997, 451). Such an attitude pl ays an additional role: note that \"child\" is often \"offspring,\" further naturalisin g the i ssue and eliding the Pinker's naturali stic approa ch is offered as a release from the type of evaluative, di dactic rhetoric fa voured by Miller: \"The evol ution-free discourse that has prevailed for decades has treated childr earing as a technologi cal probl em of deter mining whi ch practices t he best childr en\" (Pinker 1997, 451). Pinker is well awar e that acceptance of the (new) evol utionary view will be contingent on the rejection of lo ng-held traditional folk beliefs about parenting. F or those who s uspect this issue is a soci al not sc ientific one, Pinker tries to offer a wider definition of what types of qu estions scientists (including psychologists) can and sh ould ask : \"The id ea that parents 37 shape thei r children i s so ingr ained that most people don't realize it is a testable hy pothes is and not a self-evident truth\" (Pinker 1997, 448). He goes on to show that this hypothes is has been tested, and found wanting (if not quit e falsified) : \"Judith Harris has amas sed ev idenc e that c hildren everywher e are soci alized by t heir peer group, not by their parent s\" (Pinker 1997, 449). Note that th is is an empirical cl aim (\"amassed evidence\") support ed with reference to a named r esearcher ( additional schol arly apparat us is incl uded at th e end of the book). This line bet ween conventi on - the f olk wisdom - and empirical sci entific fact is one that Pinker treads carefully. In this case, it is clear t hat he want s to privilege the cl aims of rese archers sym pathetic to the evolut ionar y view - but he is by no means dismissive of folk wisdom. Pinker and Burt's respective discussions of art (Burt [1933] 1945, 267-310; Pinker 1997, 521-565) are illu strative of how each treats of the relation between fol k wisdom and sci entific psychology , and merit some closer analysi s. For a start, the range of reference is very different. Burt's examples were almost exclusi vely high-culture: Rubens, Turner (Burt [1933] 1945, 273), Robert Louis St ephe nson (274), George Eliot (275), Botticelli, Bach, Shakespear e (279). Pi nker' s refer ences ar e far more catholic - televi sion shows alongside comic b ooks, pop so ngs alo ngside literary ref erences.26 Oddly, this is someth ing Pink er has receiv ed criticism for (for example, liter ary critic Joseph Carroll complains that \"there is little evidence that [Pinker's] familiarity with most of the works he quotes ext ends ver y far beyond the quotations\" [Carroll 1998, 479]), but Pinker's r easons for usi ng such a broa d range of references has little to do wit h proving to hi s reader ship how much he has read. To criticise the depth of Pinker's engagement with t he material is to miss the point. 26 Woody Allen (Pinker 19 97, 542), National Lampoon's movies ( Anim al House [548]), pop songs ( Bob Dylan a nd Lou Reed [535]), an d, sprinkle d among them, some quotations fr om canonical literature ( Shakespear e [528], Dryden [539], Joyce [541], and Kafka [ 541]). 38 These ref erences are not si mply about making the text more \"amusing\" or more \"populist.\" Instead, they ser ve an i mportant f unction i ncorporati ng (and r etaining) the wisdom of folk psychology wit hin the knowledge of scientific psychology. Rather than set tradition agains t science, Pink er carefully sele cts m aterial sym patheti c to a scientific expl anati on. These non-scientific elements - an appo site quote from Woody Allen, for example - are used to prepare the grou nd for an expl anation of the same phenomenon deri ved from evolutionar y biology (e.g., Pinker 1997, 467). Pinker's use of jokes, aphori sms, and quotes al so enables him to appease those readers who may feel slighted at the substitution of folk psychology for sc ientific psychology . There' s an of folk psychology and sci entific psychology at work here . As a piece of folk wisdom, an anec dote or a popular aphorism i s recogni sed as containing something essentiall y true. Pinker's i ntention i s to explai n that (and how) thi s \"folk truth\" i s grounded in a scientific truth. Th is process convert s folk psychology to scientific psychology without erasing or wholl y invalidating t he fol k belief. Instead, his sci entific explanation si mply slips a new foundation underneath the existing belief. It's true not because people hav e alway s believed it, but because of some (evolved) bi ological-chemical-physical reason. Argument from experience or t radition is rationalised and naturalised as argument from material cause. Scientific psyc hology is allowed to super vene upon folk psychology, whil st those part s of folk psychology amenable to sci entifi c expl anations are conser ved, no t as evidence of folk wisdom, but as folk supp ort for scientific belief. In a sense, the positive use of aphorism enables him t o persuade the reader that what is bei ng introduced here i s not a novel conclusion , but simply a novel justification. A good example of t his is how Pink er argues from the relative size and characteristi cs of the sper m and ovum to th e propensity of men to 39 seek multi ple sexual part ners (Pinker 1997, 461-471).27 So, from a discussion of the physical differ ences between male an d female gametes (Pinker 1997, 463), comes the physi cal cons equenc e that \"a single male can fertilize many females\" and \"the reproductive su ccess of males depends on how many femal es they mate with\" (464). The et hological consequences of this ar e then demonstrated with a discussion of natural conditions: \"male mammal s compete for opportuniti es to ha ve sex with female mammals\" (465). This is shown to be the case with reference to \"typical mammals\" (464); first to el ephant seals, then gibbons, gorillas, chimpanzees, and finally with t he bono bo (man's closes t genetic relative) (465). The gradi ent is deliberate, for eventuall y, Pinker moves to include humans within the same sweep, carefully bal ancing emphas is between similarity and differ ence: The human mati ng syst em is not lik e any other ani mal's. But that does not mean it escapes the la ws go verning mating syst ems, which have been documented in hu ndreds of s pecies . Any gene predi sposing a male to be cuckol ded, or a femal e to recei ve less pater nal help than her nei ghbors , woul d quickl y be tossed f rom the gene pool. (467) Note how the second sentence effectiv ely negates the first. So although it might first appear that Pinker i s allowing for human dis tinctivenes s, closer readi ng reveals that whatever i t is that makes the human mati ng system unlike \"any other animal's\" (and this is kept deliber ately vague so as t o allow for whatev er uniquenes s the reader want s to inse rt), it is in the end less si gnificant than the commonalit ies the syst em ha s with t he m ating syste ms of the \"typi cal ma mmal.\" Finally, three illustrations are gi ven - the first from Clark and Hatfield' s experiment on a ttractiv eness (where pass ers-by are asked by 27 Burt and Pinker's discu ssions o f human sexuality occur at Burt [1933] 1 945, 181- 197; and Pinker 1997, 4 60-498. 40 an attractive stranger if t hey want to go to bed wi th them: majority of men say yes, majorit y of wom en say n o, see Clark and Hatfield 1989; Pinker 1997, 595), the second is a humorous anec dote about Calvin Coolidge asking how many sexual partners a rooster had in a day, the third a reference to an Isaac Bashevi s Singer story. The Clark and Hatfield i s a legitimat e piece of experiment al psychol ogy, the Coolidge st ory is pop- cultur e, and the Si nger story is high cult ure. A ll confirm the prediction from cell biology and ev olutionary theor y. The over all stru cture mo ves from light-hearted jokes from G. K. Chesterton, through cell biology, to zoology, t o human ethol ogy, to psyc hology, and finally, returns to light- hearted jokes. Stat ed bal dly, t he passa ge achieves a cl aim t o the eff ect that micr ophysical differen ces betw een cells cause v ariance in gender- behaviour at the (macrophysi cal) organismic level. Bu t the transition is so smoot h and efficient that the reader may not reali se that they have been at each st age car efully aligned with the evolutionary psychol ogical poi nt of view.28 Again, to stress the de velopment of bot h psyc hology as a dis cipline and the act of popularisation, Pi nker's wor k here can be fruitfully compared to Burt's. Like Pinker, Burt had initially situated the human within the wider cont ext of bi ology (\"Almost the ent ire animal kingdom, and a large part of t he world of plants, i s divided into two hal ves - mal e and femal e\" [Burt (1933) 1945, 181]) and subsequently made a cursor y nod to ev olutionary theory ,29 but this was not subs tantive, and was not 28 It might seem that this implies an u nlikely degr ee of rhetorical dexterity, but elsewhere, Pinker shows that he is alert to exactly this type of manipulation. For example, he quotes a lin e from Rona ld Reagan \"I notice everyone in favo ur n has already been born\" (Pinker 1997 , 549) to late r illustrate h ow \"getting\" the joke requires tacitly agreeing that \"there are two kinds of individuals, the born a nd the unborn. Those are the te rms in which abortion op ponents want the issue to be framed, and anyone who understands the quip has implicit ly acknowledged that th e framing is possible\" (Pinker 1997, 5 52). 29 \"...nature is always exp erimenting; and the stru ggle for existence kil ls off the ill- adapted, while the fitte st alone survive and hand down to posterity their improved endowment. \" (Burt [1933] 1945, 182) 41 brought to bear upon his l ater claims . The function of su ch ar guments ( as it would be in Pinker) was to facilit ate a claim that t he knowledge science already has of the animal ki ngdom was transferable to the study of humans. Burt moved from here to discuss how these lo cal differences resulted in the gross anatomi cal differences between male and female, and then pres ented s everal theori es about how these changes had emerged. (References we re to J. S. Mill, Da rwin, Lombroso, Herbert Spencer, and finally two academi cs, Geddes and Thomson, whose theor y of the evol ution of the sexes had been published i n 1889. As was customar y - certai nly for popul ar wor ks and ev en ac ademic - no schol arly appar atus was pr ovided for the reader to check these sources.) Unlike Pi nker, however, these claim s for cro ss-species similarity went no further than the physiological, and no attempt was made to li nk, in a substantive ma nner, biology and psychol ogy. This is cer tainly not i ntended as a criti cism. Apart from a hopelessl y general cl aim for \"materialism\" or th e first wave of behavi ourism, there really was no unifyi ng th eory for Burt to employ . Inadvertently (but not insignificantly) mirroring the st ate of th e discipline, Burt's mat erial appears somewhat fragment ary and di sjoint ed; there are occasional contradi ctions between the authors, and a confusio n between di dactic mat erial and descri ptive mat erial. This latter (between the normative and the natur alistic) is of especial import ance. The cl ear demarcation Pinker makes between (a) the findings of experimental psy chology and (b) the best way t o raise your chil d, was no t so clear for Burt and his colleagues (and their audience). One consequence of this is that the di stinction between scientific research and folk wisdom is much less clear - a confusion whi ch is exacer bated (to t he modern eye in parti cular) by t he reliance on anecdotal mat erial and per sonal exper ience. Whilst Pinker' s book may appear to elide the same boundar y with its blend of authoritative claims a nd humorous illustrations, careful 42 exami nation reveals that the anecdotal material here has a very different role than in Burt 's book. For Pinker, the humo rous-anecdotal material i s not in itself evidential, but instead is intended to point up the similarities between ex isting folk wis dom and ev olutionary psychology (as the theory with which it will be supplanted; where consonance demonstrates the descri ptive power of evol psychology ). Loosely , the anecdotal data corr elates with folk belief, and the scientific data correlates with a theor etical claim suppor ting and support ed by a familiar \"everyday\" experience - each offering mutual support for the other. As Pinker's writing shif ts bet ween anecdotal dat a and scientific data it becomes apparent that ever y refere nce is made to work i n favour of pr omoting evolutionary psychol ogy: the facts ar e all in service of th e cent ral theor y. Of co urse, the ma nifest su ccess of Burt's book suggests that the absence of references to specific experi ments di dn't harm t he book' s popularit y, and if today' s reader is su rprised by Burt's use of anecdotal material, then it is sure ly also true that Burt's audience would have been equally surprised by Pinker's pr ovision of quite so much schol arly apparat us: How The Mind Wor ks (1997) su pplie s 57 pages of references, comprising 21 pa ges of n otes followed by a 36 page, 898 item bibliography. It seems that the mo dern audience - per haps accustomed to just the sort of fact-heavy po pulari sation Bur nham thought was so destructive - e xpects scie ntific literature to provide its readership with at least the opportunity to \"c heck the facts,\" even if few will actually trouble to do so. That Burt's work escapes this dema nd for referencing bot h reflect s the nor mal practice of the da y and further suggest s that a 1930s readershi p was mor e trusting of t he aut hority of the science- writer's pronouncement s simply on the basi s of his or her position. Recall that Burt reinforces his author ity through talk of the \"p lain man\" ([1933] 1945, 8) and the \"ordinar ([1933] 1945, 181), shar pening t he contr ast with the man of sci ence. 43 From here, it is tempting to clai m that the abundance of anec dotal material indicates that psychol ogists (and scientist s gener ally) in the 1930s reli ed entirely on author ity for their argumentative force. But to leave it at that would be mi sleading. Burt takes the approach he does because partly this was (even in the 1930s) still the infancy of experimental psychology so empirical re sults wer e accor dingly scar e, and partly because the nature of an ev idential c laim was different. So it is not that scientists di d not need to displa y evidence that th ey were correct, rather that the type of evidence the 1930s scientist ne eded to displ ay was different. In Burt's time, and especia lly for practising psychiatrists Miller and Jones, these ar e not just \"anecd otes,\" but medical case notes, and as such, considered suffici ent as evi dential claims. As case notes, the anecdot al data sits alongside t he expe rimental result with comparable statu s. There is an ext ent to which thi s is related to (and surely al so foster ed by) the patr iarchal atti tude take n with respect to the dispensation of child-rearing ad vice. The \"doctorly\" tone M iller (in particular) adopts is consistent with the psychia trist's role as a medical practitioner rather than an experi mental sci entist. So one way t o account for the lack of familiar schol arly apparat us in Burt's How The Mind Wor ks is to recall that the distinction between psyc hology and psyc hiatry is less distinct - both for the publi c the book is aimed at and (judgi ng by the sel ection of contribut ors) for the discipline itself. As mentioned above, respect for the medical profession (such as it is) is grounded in utility: success is measured by pr agmatic st andards - does it hel p? - rather t han epistemol ogical st andards - accor dingly, diff erent standar ds hold i n each case. A practi sing doctor does not cite the medical paper s that support his di agnosi s or course of treatment. A scientist, as an ac ademic researcher, however, is usually required to do s o. It is not necessar y to explain why a treatment wo rks, only to demonstrate that it 44 does. In this respect, t here is more room within psychiatry than within psychology to appeal to the ty pe of case-bas ed ap proach more legitimate within medical practice than within scientific resear ch. Burt and hi s contributors will frequently rely on just such isolat ed incidents as demonstrative of th e truth of a wider principle. Again, Miller's section of How The Mind Wor ks (1933), for example, is heavily reliant upon thi s technique: \"Some time ago, I had to see a little boy who was backwar d in mental development. ... he gnawed the edge of my desk\" (Miller in Burt [1933] 1945, 111) \"I have many childr en under my care whose family hi stories...\" (113) Although superficially similar to Pi nker's anecdotal illustrations (for example, the \"Hugh Grant incident\" discuss ed by Pink er 1997, 475), the crucial diff erence is that in Burt 's book, these anecdotal \"fact s\" are apparently c onsidered s ufficient as evidential claims: which is to say, they remain uns upported by (explicit) reference to the ty pe of experiment s that would b e necessary to satisf y the rea dership Pinker clearl y has in min d when he i ncludes thorough li sts of the experiment al data that supports his own anecdotal facts. Taken together, this suggests that a soci ologi cal shift has occurred between the 1930s and the 1990s, such that this reliance on the a priori authority of professional s is no long er granted, but mus t be es tablis hed with refer ence to furt her sour ces (bot h within the pr ofessi onal communit y, and if possible, out side of it al so). Secondl y, the disci pline of psychol ogy has shifted from bei ng ambi guousl y medic al to being unambiguous ly scientific. So anot her change that becomes apparent from this comparison is the way in whi ch psycho logy presents itself to the public. 45 When Bur t was writing, psychologi sts and psy chiatris ts were less easily distingui shable than when Pi nker is writing. The period intervening these two versi ons of How the Mind Wor ks coincides with a clarification of the differences bet ween psyc hology and psychiatr y. Psychological \"Fa cts\" From the comparison between Pinker's and Burt's versions of How The Min d Wor ks, the development in the po pularis ation of ps ychology shows some di stinct trends t hat ext end beyond Burnham's acco unt. Against Burnham' s expect ations, the populari sation in the lat e 1990s looks a good deal more \"sci entific\" than it did in the 1930s (or, for that matter, in the 1940s, with t he second edition of Burt's How The Mind Works). Prominent i s the clear distinct ion in Pink er's work between the naturalis tic and the normative, which is not c lear in Burt's book . This seems to occur because (in the terms outlined above) the di stinction between \" popular psychol ogy\" and \"pop ularis ation of psyc hology \" is not well established when Burt is writing. As should be clear, es pecially from the material Miller contributes ab out the child and the family, the boundar y between psychology-as- science and psychology- as-self-hel p is blurred thr ough much of the material. It doesn't help that when Burt is compiling the book, the di scipline sits uncomfortab ly between opposing model s of psychological motivation. How The Mind Wor ks ([1933] 1945) endorses both Freudian psych oanalysis (though Burt himself does not - these pi eces being wri tten by Ernest Jones30) with its reliance on narrati ve explanations, al ongside the more empirici st-mat erialist position that would later come to dominate the fiel d. Burt's r eadership meets 30 Sometimes Jones's popularisation o f Freud see ms to have been tactfully modified, as with his d escription of Oedipal hunger: \" no one, for examp le, unless h e is mad is aware of a desire to eat his mother, and yet this is a common and powerful idea in th e unconscio us.\" (Ernest Jo nes in Burt [ 1933] 1945, 71-72) 46 psychology at a point when it ha s accepted hy pnotis m but rejec ted phrenol ogy (Burt [1933] 1945, 329-330).31 By the time Pinker is writing, normative claims ar e anat hema to what is expected of sc ience, and he is careful to distingui sh bet ween what is biologi cally normal and what is right. Pinker's book is not without ap peals to narrat ive explanation, of course, but his is a very differ ent sort of narrative: not ju st mi nor vi gnettes which illustrate a point, but above th ese, a grand narrative, one which unifies the material under a coherent fr amework. It is in this respect that Pinker's work differs mos t strikingly from Burt's and als o deviates from Burnham's prediction for the future of the science populari sation. Neither Pi nker nor Burt are gui lty of massing unrelated facts, but it is wort h noting that a principal reas on why the di ssolution of sci ence populari sation to \"impotent snippets\" th at Burnham s ees occurring later in the hi story of popularisations of psyc hology doesn't happen in Burt's work is because it cannot happen: the di scipline's relative in fancy means there simply ar en't enough isolat ed, granul ar facts avail able. So t he descent into the li sting of isol ated fact s can be seen, to so me ext ent, as an indicator of the maturity of th e science being popul arised. By the time Pinker is writing, ther e are sufficient facts to allow for a listing approach, but rather than displa ying a disparate series of unrel ated facts, as Burnham mi ght have predict ed, Pinker's How T he Mind Works succeeds instead i n the communi cation of an unifying theoretical framewor k, within which the facts are lo calised. Pinker is not so interested in telling us facts about the mind as he is in selling us a worldview. His use of factual infor mation i s subservi ent to this - he draws data from a wide range of fields always to effect the same end: na mely, t he pr omot ion of the EP agenda. Pinker's treatmen t of folk wisdom through c arefully 31 Although, t hat said, a f ondness for anthropometric data remains - Burt t ells us t hat \"investigators... going int o.. mental hospitals... measuring the length and t hickness of inmates' bo dies\" have detected a co nnection \"be tween the physical and t he temperame ntal types.\" (Burt [1933] 1945, 24) 47 chosen anecdotal data is deliberatel y assimilati ve, aiming to i ncorporat e as much of the exi sting fol k psychol ogy and customary belief as he can within the new evolutionar y perspecti ve, minimi sing the clash between the scientific and the traditional whilst always privil eging the sci entific. Because his audi ence alr eady has a degree of experiential/oc cupational knowledge about the subject matter, Pinker's book does n't strive for radical novelt y, as (f or exampl e) Ha wking does when he is writing about black holes and warped s pace-time. Ins tead, Pinker exploit s the simil arity of his conclusions to thos e already found in folk psychology (or rather, he isolat es and emphasises those pa rts of folk psychology which are consi stent with EP and di sregards by omission those part s which ar e not). This careful blending of folksy-anecdot al material and empirical scientific claims marks a level of rhetori cal sophi stication ab sent in Burt's book - demonstr ating a gr owth i n the scop e and sophistication of technique characteri stic of a something approa ching a professi science popularisation. Concl usion: A Te ntative A etiology The earl y 1980s were the scene of an appar ent boom in popular science wr iting. But when How Supers tition Won (1987) was published, some commentators appear ed to ques tion whether the \"boom\" in popular science had occurr ed at all, f or it se emed clear that whatever impetus the populari sation of sci ence (incl usive of psychology) may have enj oyed in the early 1980s had, by the mid-to-lat e 1980s, largely run out of energy.32 32 Bruce Lewenstein (1987 ) asked: \"W as There Really a Popular Science 'Boom'?\" He concludes t hat \"The science boom was real . It's death, however, was only partially real.\" (39) It's notable th at Lewenstein excludes from his survey of the rise and fall of science writ ing in the 19 80s writers whose work deals with \"science in general\" - among who m he includ es Stephen Jay Gould, Lewis Thomas, and Carl Sagan (39; n.1). All of whom are notable for the strong theor etical frameworks around which their books and a rticles are w ritten. 48 It is within this last (apparent) slump that Burnham was wr iting, but in the years since then (1987), the volume and popularity of popular s cience writing has expanded mark edly, and the character of popul ar science writing has under gone a shift in bot h content and quality. It seems fair to assume that he first of these is a consequence of the second. No compr ehensi ve expl anation exists for this change, but the success of a few books - most nota bly Stephen Hawking' s Brief Histor y of Tim e (1987) - seem to have triggered a new interest in the field. Apparently, the real popular science boom was yet to co me. Science writers such as Ri chard Dawkins, Stephen Jay Goul d, Stephen Hawki ng, Steven W einberg, P aul Davies, John Gribbin, and Matt Ridley all published book s which seemed to an swer Burnham's complaint that sc ience popularis ation was no mo re than a collection of impotent snippets of fact. The new popular books posses sed a more pronounced theor etical dimensi on. Some, such as G ould's Wonderful Lif e (1990), or Jared Di amond' s The Rise and F all of the T hird Chi mpanz ee (1991) and Guns, G erms, and Steel (1996), blended an hi storical approach with the populari sation of sci entific mat erial to produce a grand narrative of human histor y, variousl y emphasi zing cont ingency or greed as t he defining character of natur e. By the lat e 1990s, a book like Pinker's How T he Mind Works was a typical populari sation. Rat her than producing a fragment ary list of isolated facts, the popular science book had become more like a theor etically coherent treatise, wh ere the promotion of a scientific worldv iew was given greater emphas is than the di ssemi nation of sci entific facts. So me books w ere more like philosophical trea tment s of sci ence The centrality of the scientific \" attitude\"33 and, in some cases, t he expli cit denouncement of 33 For exampl e, Weinberg (1992), 258-259. 49 non-scientific irrationalism (esp. from Dawkins), seem exactly what Burnham had in mind when he spoke of the \"religi on of science.\" It is tempting to see these last de velopments as a consequence of the so-call ed \"science war s.\" It might be plausibly ar gued that the return to global theories i s not a dir ect refl ection of the unity of scientists and scientific t hought, but a direct respon se by sci entists to per ceived or actual attacks on the foundations of scientific thought. That is, claims for the unity of the sciences ar e a politic al response to a per ceived threat from preci sely that (f irst) gener ation of non-scientific thinkers most eager to accede to what Burnha m sees as the gradual erosion of scientific authority t hrough fragmentar y and di sunified popularisations. If the super stitious won ou t over the scientific in the publi c's eyes ( and in the eyes of academi cs outsid e the sci ences), then the melee that erupted i n the year s immediat ely following Burn ham's book seems to len d some credibility to his conclusion that ( both epistemological and sociological) respec t for s cience was being eroded by low- quality po pularisatio ns. Gros s and Lev itt's Higher Superstition (1997), the Sokal Hoax (1996), the replies and responses by (mos t notabl y) Andr ew Pickering and Andr ew Ross, and the counter respons e by Sokal and Bric mont ( Intellectual Impostur [1998]) or Steven Weinber g that followed, cl osely preceded the arrival of this new type of popular science. Of t hese, E. O. Wilson' s Consilience (1998) deserves especi al att ention for its explicit claims for the theoretical consistency of the sciences , its denunc iation of the humanities, and its call s for me thodol ogical moni sm across t he writes , \"the unknown, is a shrinki ng domi nion. We have the common goal of turning as muc h philosophy as possible into science\" (Wilson 1998, 10). It is surely too strong to claim that the mo tive for the scienc e wars (that is, a perceived lack of respec t for the sciences by no n-scientific academics) was root ed in the decline i n popu larisations that Burnham's account 50 records. It does, however, seem plausi ble to suggest that the rise of the theor etically-oriented populari sation, di splaying at l east the edifice of a unified sci entific community, has occurr ed in response. 51 Works Cited Barkow, Jerome H., Le da Cosmides and J ohn Tooby eds. 1992.
