IBD has arisen as a socio-economic problem in recent years with an increasing incidence and prevalence in East Asia. [2](#B2-ir-12-124), [3](#B3-ir-12-124), [4](#B4-ir-12-124) [5](#B5-ir-12-124), [6](#B6-ir-12-124)The risk of opportunistic infectious diseases is increased in patients with IBD due to exogenous immunosuppressive medications and also due to the endogenous immunosuppressive mechanism of IBD itself. [7](#B7-ir-12-124)In a study conducted in the United States, infection was the most common cause of hospital admission, accounting for 27.5% of all patients admitted with IBD; sepsis and pneumonia were the leading causes of death. [8](#B8-ir-12-124)The major causes of pneumonia, including infection with influenza virus, pneumococcus, and other bacterial species, could be prevented with appropriate vaccination. [9](#B9-ir-12-124)Therefore, several clinical practice guidelines for IBD patients recommend annual vaccination. [7](#B7-ir-12-124)However, both doctors and patients have overlooked the importance of vaccination in clinical practice. In addition, the status of vaccination in IBD patients has been insufficiently investigated in Korea. [10](#B10-ir-12-124)Despite the use of various medications such as steroids, immunomodulators, and TNF- blockers, symptoms are only partially controlled in some patients. Many CAM treatments for IBD have not yet been medically proven. However, many people believe that CAM treatments are less toxic and considerably safer than the standard medical treatment and this has generated growing interest and increased usage. [11](#B11-ir-12-124)Some studies report that 21-60% of IBD patients in Western countries use CAM treatments. [1](#B1-ir-12-124), [12](#B12-ir-12-124)However, there has been little investigation of the use of CAM by IBD patients in Korea, probably due to a lack of interest by physicians. We therefore performed this study to investigate the status and patient awareness of vaccination and CAM use in IBD patients. METHODS 1. Patients and Survey 2. Statistical Analysis RESULTS 1. Baseline Characteristics of Patients [Table 1](#T1-ir-12-124)). 2. Vaccination [Fig. 1](#F1-ir-12-124)). Excluding vaccinations during childhood, 71 respondents (59.2%) had received 1 vaccination (hepatitis A, hepatitis B, pneumococcus, human papillomavirus, influenza, and/or herpes zoster), whereas 49 (40.8%) had not. The total vaccination rate was not significantly different among the disease groups. Among those who were vaccinated, 19 patients (15.8%) were vaccinated against hepatitis A, 36 (30.0%) against hepatitis B, 5 (4.2%) against pneumococcus, 2 (1.7%) against human papillomavirus, 53 (44.2%) against influenza, and 7 (5.8%) against herpes zoster. Those who were not vaccinated were asked to state the reason for the non-vaccination. Twenty-three patients (46.9%) replied that had forgotten the type of vaccination, 5 (10.2%) stated fear of adverse events, 5 (10.2%) thought that vaccines were ineffective, 7 patients (14.3%) stated other reasons, and 9 patients (18.4%) did not reply ( [Table 2](#T2-ir-12-124)). 3. Complementary and Alternative Medicine [Table 3](#T3-ir-12-124)). CAM products were purchased directly in 12 patients (33.3%), gifted by friends or family members in 15 (41.6%), and purchased through the internet in 7 (19.4%). Considering the reason for CAM use, 14 patients (38.9%) stated improvement in symptoms, 15 (41.6%) stated friends' suggestions, 1 (2.7%) stated the media, 2 (5.6%) stated relief of anxiety, 4 (11.1%) stated other reasons, and 7 (18.9%) did not respond. CAM use was found to be subjectively effective in 20 patients (55.6%) and subjectively ineffective in 6 patients (16.7%); 10 patients (27.8%) did not answer this question ( [Table 4](#T4-ir-12-124)). DISCUSSION [13](#B13-ir-12-124), [14](#B14-ir-12-124)According to a study performed in the United States, 86% of patients with IBD received immunosuppressive treatment. In contrast, only 28% were vaccinated against influenza and only 9% against pneumococcus. [15](#B15-ir-12-124), [16](#B16-ir-12-124)A Korean study showed similar results, with a low vaccination rate (37.5% with the influenza vaccine and 6.3% with the pneumococcal vaccine). [17](#B17-ir-12-124)In our study, the vaccination rates were 44.2% with the influenza vaccine and 5% with the pneumococcal vaccine, which were comparable with previous results. Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and human papillomavirus vaccination rates were even lower, ranging between 1.7% and 29.2%. [18](#B18-ir-12-124)The actual vaccination rate was also higher than that in our study; 65.3% with the influenza vaccine and 65.3% with the pneumococcal vaccine. According to subgroup analysis, the patient group most aware of the need for vaccination (age 60 years, use of anti-TNF agent or rituximab) had a higher pneumococcal vaccination rate. [18](#B18-ir-12-124)Similarly, in our study the vaccination rate was also higher in the patients who were aware of the importance of vaccination. [19](#B19-ir-12-124)Likewise, checking each patient's vaccination status regularly at outpatient clinics is crucial to increase the vaccination rate. [20](#B20-ir-12-124)In a New Zealand study on IBD patients, the most common CAM was oral products, as in our study. However, in a German study, the most common CAM was homeopathy, accounting for 52.9%.
