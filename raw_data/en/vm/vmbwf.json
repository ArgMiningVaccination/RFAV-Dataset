This is a great place to learn a lot of things. You can learn about Chiropractic; and a lot about me, Dr. Jeffrey Arnel. I've been practicing Chiropractic for over 20 years at my present location, and I've loved every minute of it. The primary reason for this is that I've been so successful at helping people in my community to get their health and their life back, without the use of medications and surgeries. That's the beauty of what I do. I've learned, and publically spoken about the body's incredible built-in ability to heal itself, once the interference to that healing is removed. That's what I do, and I love doing it. I've always had a burning desire to be as helpful to as many people as possible, in restoring health, function, vitality, immunity, resistance, and life, back to normal. The side effect to this is that people also feel better along the way. You get the best of both worlds. Health begins with HEAL. Let's work together to get you to heal, and feel better, so you can enjoy your life to the max.
