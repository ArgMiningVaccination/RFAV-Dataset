I have been diagnosed with epilepsy for almost ten years now, however I was having seizures that went unnoticed as early as 4th grade. I am now 24. I live in Montana, which is technically a medical marijuana state. Unfortunately, due to unconstitutional meddling by the feds, most docs around here are too afraid to prescribe or even recommend medical marijuana. Since ALL anti-epileptic drugs seem to pose some sort of allergy for me (with the exception of Zonegran and Valium) I have been seeking herbal treatment for some time now. I am curious as to how many folks out there have given this therapy a try, since it has worked wonders for me. I have several types of seizures, but the tonic-clonic seizures are obviously the worst. I have a lot of difficulty coming out of the postictal stage without a small bit of bud, even if it must be blown on my face. Then I come around quite quickly and am back to \"normal\" very fast. I also am less likely to seize if I feel strange and as a precaution smoke a little. I am not stoned or high all the time; I use it as medication. I want to share my experiences with others so that maybe they may consider this alternative therapy, and help in the movement to reform marijuana laws so that folks like us do not suffer needlessly. All thoughts are welcome. Best wishes, Sarah Comments Re: Medical Marijuana As An Alternative Herbal Therapy Submitted by Sarah24 on Wed, 2009-04-29 - 00:11 Hi! First off, be very, very grateful that you have the support that you do!! I have an extremely supportive husband, however, my family is in denial about my seizures despite having witnessed several major ones. It hurts that my own mother has refused to do any research AT ALL on epilepsy, despite the fact that I have been diagnosed with it by two different docs in two different states! It has formed a breach in our family, and seeing as I am going on 10 years since the diagnosis it just plain hurts when I think of the negligence that they have shown when I was younger. It also helps me the most just before and after seizures....the period of time that I am seizing drops and I come out of them much, much faster. While it hasn't stopped completely for me, it has greatly lessened the severity of my grand mals. I have several other types of seizures and it has reduced them as well, it is just easier to see the effects with the grand mals. KEEP ON TOKING IF IT HELPS YOU!!! Be careful about the legalities, though. I agree that it seems to be best to smoke small amounts all day as opposed to just getting 'blasted' once a day. A little bit of it goes a long way if you have some good bud. A hit or two can stop a seizure or even seems to bring me out of them if I am already having one (doesn't stop them all for me, just some and that's more than any meds EVER did). Best wishes and be safe! Oh, and it helps greatly with the depression that I suffer from after a seizure. I used to crawl in bed after a bad one and stay for days, but with pot I no longer sink to that level. Sarah Hi! First off, be very, very grateful that you have the support that you do!!

That is why an intervention doesn't condone using physical strength to get somebody into rehab. An intervention is, for the most part, individuals gathering to defy an addicted individual's dependency and making her face the reality that she necessitates proper care. sofearinozat [Minnesota Drug Treatment Centers](http://www.drugstrategies.org/Treatment/Minnesota) In recent times, individuals have realized that when it's not because of the individual's freewill, it did not give the needed results.

I do not think people should smoke like i do if they are just using it as a recreation drug.

Re: Medical Marijuana As An Alternative Herbal Therapy Submitted by Sarah24 on Wed, 2009-04-29 - 12:45 Violarose, Thanks for the response, and I have to agree with you. I believe myself that it should be treated like any other medication and dosed as such. In other words, I do not smoke to get \"high\" but to keep my symptoms of my seizures and several other medical conditions at a minimum. It works so well and so naturally I truly do not see it (myself) as a recreational thing to do, however, I am not against it as it has caused no deaths, no overdoses, and hurts far less folks than alcohol and tobacco, which are legal. I think it should be decriminalized for responsible adult use in the home, just like alcohol and tobacco are. There is no reason for the stigma/taboo against it. Thanks for your input; I did not know that about depakote. That was another drug that failed me where marijuana has not.

Best wishes, Sarah Re: Medical Marijuana As An Alternative Herbal Therapy Submitted by sporkonafork on Sat, 2009-08-08 - 04:10 theres alot of other alternatives that have helped me and YES they can be obtained legaly unlike marijuana . i had a few mild nocturnal sezures once every 3-5 months (lasting just a few seconds) since 11/04 the first being worse when awake i took meds for 11 months.. i think this was a mistake because ive had long term side effects to this day! im still confused if it was due to the seizure itself of taking dilantin that long. that medicine was hell. now back on topic , i drink camomille tea this can be found in any supermarket for only $2 for 25 tea bags.. i also have the tea stems of this tea sold in the spice isle , i chew on these leaves like gum , when its an emergency . yes i have close calls all the time of getting a seizure. Drinking this tea is very relaxing i was even told by my neuroligist about this tea, i like to soak the tea bag in the hot water for 10-15 minutes so its more strong than the 2 mins it says on the box . i hope i can help someone here i have helped a few of my online friends recommending this tea to them.. this tea is very good if youve had a stressfull day . Lavendar oil works very wel too iput a small ammount on my neck as im putting on some perfume I wish all of you good luck i hope all of you feel better someday... as well as i feel better myself you know in a way me getting sick my first time has changed me for the better in a way , me and my mom are closer now , ive had a spiritual awakening , i was athiest/hated god before i got sick, i felt somewhat suicidal at times before gettin sick now im afaid to die . god bless you all, Katie theres alot of other alternatives that have helped me and YES they can be obtained legaly unlike marijuana . i had a few mild nocturnal sezures once every 3-5 months (lasting just a few seconds) since 11/04 the first being worse when awake i took meds for 11 months.. i think this was a mistake because ive had long term side effects to this day! im still confused if it was due to the seizure itself of taking dilantin that long. that medicine was hell. now back on topic , i drink camomille tea this can be found in any supermarket for only $2 for 25 tea bags.. i also have the tea stems of this tea sold in the spice isle , i chew on these leaves like gum , when its an emergency . yes i have close calls all the time of getting a seizure.

Sarah Re: Medical Marijuana As An Alternative Herbal Therapy Submitted by johnny on Wed, 2009-04-29 - 14:44 Yes I need to put in my two cents about MJ and I think if its used and not abused its GREAT !!!! I have epilepsy for 7 years now and have herbally treated myself to avoid the side effects of all the 6000 mgs of depressing AED's that I take. I can vouch while under the influence of about 1 gram a day of MJ during the evening hours. I have never had a seizure. I know doctors that think MJ is a great med for certain patients and also know doctors who think that MJ is worse than alchohol to use. It basically is based on a narrow minded point of view that people seem to be stuck on what at one time was brought down with prohibition and alchohol and has been frowned upon so bad ever since. But it just dont make sense to me how 1/3 of what is called the United States can perscribe it and the other 2/3 can't.

Re: Medical Marijuana As An Alternative Herbal Therapy Submitted by Sarah24 on Wed, 2009-04-29 - 19:01 Thanks, Johnny! Two cents appreciated! You are right, marijuana prohibition is very similar to what happened to alcohol. I would also encourage you to look up a book called \"The Emperor Wears No Clothes\" by Jack Herer....I already mentioned it here but I wanted to repeat in case you missed that post. It is a wonderful book that gives the absolute truth about marijuana, how it came to be illegal, how the gov't used to require (yes, require) Americans with land to grow it for the war effort, how many different medical uses it has, etc. It is a fantastic book that I recommend to anyone with an interest. It even has some copies of old gov't commands to the public regarding hemp and marijuana. An absolutely amazing book. Even when I lived in a state that did not condone medical marijuana, I had some of my docs secretly and VERY quietly agree that it at least could do me no harm if I wanted to pursue it as a side treatment. After seeing some of the posts here, I see I was very lucky to have such open-minded docs who were 'brave' enough to say that to me! Now I have a licensed caregiver who knows about the different strains and their effects on different parts of the brain to further guide me in my herbal treatment. That is one reason that I started this forum--I want to spread the word far and wide that there ARE organic, non-pharmaceutical ways to stay healthy even with such a disabling condition (mine is, I realize it is not disabling for everyone). I believe you answered yourself in your post about why it is legal only in certain parts of the country......the Bush family has ties to Pfizer, and legalizing marijuana across the board would take money away from them. Very simple. I hope I don't step on any toes as this is not meant to be a political discussion, but a healthy one. However, it is true. Even if they taxed the bejesus out of it, the mentioned family would lose tons of money because marijuana is an herbal remedy for so much more than just epilepsy. It would wipe out the need for certain expensive medications in one fell swoop. I will type more on this later, but I have to run now. Thank you for taking the time to respond, I am very pleased to know that you have also had a wonderful experience with marijuana as medication and even more pleased to hear that you are seizure-free!! That is truly a gift that only those with epilepsy can really appreciate :*) Thank you and best wishes, Sarah Thanks, Johnny! Two cents appreciated!

I smoked pot every once in awhile in my early 20's, never much though and not on a daily basis. About 3 yrs. ago I started smoking more regularly (as a stress reliever for what I thought were 'anxiety attacks'-only to find they were actually seizures), only at night when my kids are asleep and my husband is home, and I have noticed a big difference in the type of pot and when I get seizures. I do not know what the different types are but I have read on here that the type can make a difference. I live in Ohio and medical marijuana is not even a thought or possibility and when I told my doctor that I smoked she pretty much ignored the comment, did not say anything one way or another and from what I have read it seems like it was because they believe it helps but legally do not want to go there. I know this was probably not very helpful but I thought I'd let you know I kinda feel the same way. Good Luck!

Re: Medical Marijuana As An Alternative Herbal Therapy Submitted by Sarah24 on Tue, 2009-04-28 - 23:11 Hi! Always glad to hear from open minded people! BTW, your doc may secretly agree with you but legally I do not think they can endorse it's use since it is illegal in your state. Indica is one of the major strains of marijuana and has been recommended to me for my epilepsy by a certified caregiver, so that is one strain you may want to check out because the strains truly do make a difference. I am so glad to hear that you, like so many, have found relief in a non-pharmaceutical way. Herbal remedies are better for your body in general, and many of the new drugs have not been on the market long enough for us to really know about them. Pot has been used as medicine for centuries!

I was also seriously injuring myself on a regular basis and still do often enough but what is so very strange is that I had waking seizures back then, a lot of them. I've done everything from fall through a boat dock to fracture vertabrae in my neck and bust out my front teeth & more. At age thirteen I tried something new but not even as a suggestion for the seizures. Just out of small town boredom. Ever since then I never had another waking seizure. I still have seizures and they tear me up on occasion but only during sleep. That was twenty five years ago by the way. I'm no Devils advocate, this is simply personal experience. It also helps after one of those neurological trainwrecks to keep me from feeling like I've been beaten in the head with a rubber mallet. Also this is going to help me since the state decided they werent going to help me with my medication any longer. Maybe they will have enough money now to pay for the $50,000 camera at the stoplight downtown. Go America! Take care Sarah and just be careful.

Re: Medical Marijuana As An Alternative Herbal Therapy Submitted by Sarah24 on Tue, 2009-04-28 - 23:17 Hi! I hear you about the injuries....I have had a car accident, bitten off a chunk of my tongue, and even started stripping during and after seizures. Talk about embarrassing!! Fortunately my family covered me up before I wandered, as I was prone to do after a seizure prior to using marijuana. I am certainly going about it the legal way, and am involved with NORML and several other pro-marijuana foundations. I am so sorry that you are not receiving assistance with your meds.....did they give you a reason?? That is a really critical med to cut you off of. I hope you can find herbal relief safely the way so many do. Best wishes, Sarah Hi!

Take care, Brain Re: Medical Marijuana As An Alternative Herbal Therapy Submitted by Sarah24 on Thu, 2009-04-30 - 17:33 No worries, friend. Have you heard of/worked with the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) in the past? I am asking because what you have described to me, particularly the vertebrae injury due to a seizure, shows that you are most likely epileptic and therefore considered by federal law to have a disability. It sounds like your state does not want to pay up (maybe that's just me). I am also applying for disability because I cannot currently function or have a job because I have no auras before major seizures. I am, however, in training for a seizure alert dog. I won't get to see the dog or work with him/her for another year or so because it takes longer to train the humans than the people :) This will give me a lot of my independence back as the dog will be able to warn me in advance of a seizure so I can warn those around me, take some emergency meds, and get to a safe place. I am posting a little off topic because I believe this to also be very important for those with epilepsy, and it is a method of seizure control that I feel is not utilized enough. But anyway....let me know what you would like to discuss specifically and I will have my eye out for it, ok? I appreciate your interest and look forward to talking with you some more :*) Best wishes, Sarah No worries, friend.

Although, like many others I have been living with it for longer than four years. I am currently on the max dose of Keppra and I still have seizures. I have been experimenting on my own with marijuana use. I live in Colorado and was hoping to experiment legally but doctors have told me that marijuana can trigger seizures. I agree and disagree. I have found that Indica strands are best for me. I have to be extremely careful with smoking just any pot. Some growers use pestisides or other chemicals that immediately cause seizures for me. If you could find a strand that works for you and that is truly organic I think that is wonderful. It helps me get back on track when Im feeling 'off' and it helps stabalize my side effects from my medication. I am a firm beliver that if more research could be done in this feild it could help a group of epileptics that do not respond to medication.

It helps me get back on track when Im feeling 'off' and it helps stabalize my side effects from my medication. I am a firm beliver that if more research could be done in this feild it could help a group of epileptics that do not respond to medication. Thanks for your posting D Re: Medical Marijuana As An Alternative Herbal Therapy Submitted by Sarah24 on Tue, 2009-04-28 - 23:25 Hi! I have also heard that Indica is the strain to use, from a licensed caregiver. He and I had an open and frank discussion on my condition and the fact that I do not respond (or have a very negative response) to most anti-epileptic drugs. I was on Keppra and I believe that my seizures increased while on that particular drug. I am also a firm believer of organic marijuana--I do not want chemicals in my body through meds that are harmful, and that includes marijuana that has been treated with chemicals. You make a fine point that not all pot is good.....you DO have to be careful. Just like you do with any other treatment. Except this is a natural plant, and can be organic (try finding organic Keppra!). I also agree that more ACURATE research needs to be done, and the laws MUST be reformed. Thank YOU for your post!! I am so pleased that so many have found relief in an all-natural way. Sarah Hi! I have also heard that Indica is the strain to use, from a licensed caregiver.

Sarah Re: Medical Marijuana As An Alternative Herbal Therapy Submitted by henryb on Tue, 2009-04-28 - 18:30 I was just diagnosed with JME today. I've had two tonic-clonic seizures in the past 3 weeks. My neurologist wants to put me on divalproex but I'm a little leary of pharmasuticals and am exploring other options, marijuana being one of them. From what I understand, marijuana has a ton of different strains, some of which may help epilepsy, do nothing at all, or actually cause or increase the likelyhood of a seizure. I am going to be going to the Green Cross Society in Vancouver, BC to speak to their staff naturopath and will see what he says in regards to specific strains, success with cannabis + JME and whether it will work for me. I'll report back after that! In the mean time, I've just bought some street stuff - a sativa strain and during a particulary bad day of twitches I had a small puff and that seemed to level me out quite well...no more twitches. Oh, and regarding particular strains, I've heard that Indica varities are ones to be avoided. Anybody have any experiance with this? Henry I was just diagnosed with JME today.

Henry Re: Medical Marijuana As An Alternative Herbal Therapy Submitted by Sarah24 on Tue, 2009-04-28 - 23:34 Henry, I have also had positive experiences with Sativa, although by far my personal experience and information has led me to believe that Indica is the strain for epilepsy. However, everyone is different, and what works for some might not work as well or at all for others. I would encourage you to try to legally pursue this therapy if your state allows it, and if it does not allow it, either move (I did) or look at other natural therapies. Because you said you were experimenting with \"some stuff\", let me warn you and everyone else here about one thing that is legal almost everywhere but is NOT GOOD for epileptics: Salvia. It looks like marijuana, and you can buy it in most head shops cheap. From my experience, this particular herb is NOT, repeat NOT good for epilepsy. I am not a doc, but my experience with it were not good, to put it mildly. Be very careful, and stay safe. Do your research before experimenting with just anything, and if you MUST get it from the street make sure you can find out what kind it is first. Stay safe Henry, and keep us updated!

Sarah Re: Medical Marijuana As An Alternative Herbal Therapy Submitted by xgi on Tue, 2009-04-28 - 20:12 Hi everyone. I'm a male 52 been dealing with epilpesy for 21 years. Been on the pills but had bad results. Using cannabis for sezuire control nine years and have had no grandmal sezuire when actively using MJ. My family was against at first but now accept it maybe because it's legal here in Michigan I vape 3-4 times a day with some (Ak47 strain) and it keeps the sezuires away. Currently working on a private grow and my girls are doing really well. Hopefully to harvest soon Doing some research on using the \"duff\" from the vape. The duff is the marijuana left over when you're done smoking from it. A doctor told me some people were getting sezuire control out of putting that in a pill and swallowing it twice a day. I also tried some edibles made from MJ and that did well but it takes a while for the mj to get into my body. I can't say I'm totally sezuire free. Once in a while I still have small partial but I recover a lot quicker with MJ. I can say I never had a bad sezuire when I was smoking MJ so that's cool with me. You got to remember though everyone is different. I know a fellow who is so whacked on sezuire and pain pills he doesn't know what day of the week it is. I lived that life. Never again for me. I tried to get him to try weed for his sezuires but his doc has threaten to cut off his medication if he does. That's just wrong Another gal stated the one time she tried she had a grand mal. Bottom line is if the pills are ruining your life and your sick of the side effects try MJ. It doesn't have to be smoked. You can vape ,eat, make tea or make a tinture Hi everyone.

Thanks for introducing the different ways of utilizing marijuana as medicine to the forum.....less typing for me :*) That is absolutely terrible that ANY doc threatened to cut of medication. Are you in a state where it has been decriminalized? Even if you are not, the response by the doc should have had his license revoked! It is a breach of ethics to threaten to cut off meds, especially when it has nothing to do with HIS part in the patient's life....it's not like he would light up a pipe in his office!! The pills WERE ruining my life. One that I took made me gain close to 60 lbs and I was a b*tch to live with the whole time I was on it--and it did NOT STOP THE SEIZURES!!! If you use marijuana responsibly, there is no reason in this world why a responsible adult should not be able to partake when they need to. Pharmaceuticals, one after another, made my life hell for years before I turned to pot. It does not stop all of my seizures; I would never claim that it does. However, it has made my life infinitely easier and my quality of life is higher than it has been since I was diagnosed. That is the reason I started this thread....I know there must be others who are or were in the position I was in with the meds and need help but do not know the next turn. I am just offering it up as an alternative therapy, and I hope that some docs see this too. I have a hooka that I use when I don't feel like smoking, and it makes it very smooth to inhale. This simple little plant has saved me from becoming trapped in a pharmaceutical-induced haze for the rest of my life! BTW I think it is great that you are growing--just make sure you don't use any chemicals or pesticides etc. because those are not good for your body either. I have only just gotten my caregiver and will soon have a license to grow my own as well. I would love to get a vaporizer, but we just don't have the funds right now. Since I use it mainly before and immediately after a seizure, it is important that I get it in my body ASAP so I don't really cook with it, although I have a friend who has done so with great success. Thanks so much for the response and the info!! Although I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemies, it is nice to know that someone has shared a similar experience with me. Best wishes, stay safe and careful! Hi!

Re: Medical Marijuana As An Alternative Herbal Therapy Submitted by Sarah24 on Wed, 2009-04-29 - 00:23 Sorry about that question.....I missed the part where you said it is legal where you are. Scratch that :) I hope you have a wonderful harvest. I told my husband about that doc and we both agree that is definitely illegal, especially if you are in a state where it is decriminalized!! I would advise your friend to find another doc, or if that is too much trouble, just start toking and not tell the doc. It is none of his business if one of his patients chooses to seek alternative therapies, and I personally would drop him like a bad habit. IF he were to go as far as to warn his next doc about the pot idea, I would prosecute him for unethical practice. He is breaking his Oath as a Doctor by saying and doing the things you say. At the very least, file a complaint against him with the medical board. Someone who behaves like that with their patients and is unwilling to discuss alternative treatments is unethical and does not need to be practicing medicine.

You are absolutely right about the big companies losing money to herb....one of the main ones is Pfizer, mostly owned (to my understanding) by the Bush family. Since marijuana has sooo many medicinal uses other than just with epilepsy, they stand to lose a TON of cash if they legalize it across the board, even if they tax it to death because the family won't get as much. So many of these pharmaceuticals KILL every year, either by accident or by a reaction or overdose....marijuana has NEVER killed a single person.

I also obviously agree 100% about getting over a stupid stigma that is born of ignorance and that we should be introducing accurate information to the general public and letting them make up their own minds on the issue. This is not something that should be regulated by the gov't....it is a natural herbal medicine that you can grow on your own private property without causing harm or foul play to anyone. It's like banning growing penicillin on food at home. If that's how you have to seek your treatment (granted you'd have to be pretty hard up) you should be allowed to. The fact of the matter is marijuana is simply safer than so many of the drugs on the market....that alone screams for attention from the epileptic community. I have enjoyed talking with you and am very glad that I seem to be accomplishing what I wanted to when I started this....thank you so much for the feed back. Best wishes, Sarah Wow....thanks.

We have already established that different strains of marijuana effect different parts of the brain in different ways, and that is the very reason further research is needed. I feel that you have had poor personal experiences and are making the mistake of believing that your experiences speak for everyone. They do not. Marijuana has been valued as a medicine for all kinds of maladies through the CENTURIES. It is older and more proven than any drug you can get at the drug store, and it grows naturally almost everywhere in the world. I pray that you read these other posters and realize that it does not affect everyone in the same way, and that the narrow minded view that you hold now widens a little from the reading. These are testimonies from real people that it is helping. I myself am a living testimony. Frankly I would feel more comfortable debating this with you if you would pay closer attention to sentence structure as you are a little difficult to understand.

It certainly doesn't cause the damage that alcohol causes either. And considering I went into \"status epilepticus\" (look it up) which is known to kill brain cells and is an emergency, due to a medication, I would rather take my chances on a proven ancient HERBAL remedy than man-made drugs.

There are those who can claim that marijuana \"eats away at the brain\" but that is not proven. What IS proven is that our epilepsy and the seizures that follow DO kill brain cells. I think I will also be 'taking my chances' with an herb rather than a man-made drug that does God-knows-what to my head and body, thank you very much. And if marijuana keeps me from seizing, or even lessens the intensity of the seizure, then it has already helped more than doing nothing or just working with pharms has. I know everyone is different, but for the vast majority out there herb is better for you all the way around. Sarah Good point.

Or do we as COMPASSIONATE Americans just throw them out in the cold and withhold an herb that is as natural as your birthday suit?? VOTE YES!!

My tonic-clonics would come at night so I started eating strong cookies before bed. To reach a proper therapeutic levels, I would be pretty stoned and it slowing starting messing with my sleep. I would just be high all night doing fun stuff around the house. I would be like, \"What seizures, lets just watch surfing vids all night.\" Then I tried it on my clustered partials. You need to get pretty high all the time for it to work and I got sick of being high. I do lots of math and computer stuff and with MJ seizure prevention, I would read the same page of my math book about 10 times and start talking to my dog or just start laughing at my dog. I guess it worked and I had fun. If my seizures go back to extreme clusters of partials, I will do it again because I experience psychosis -- MJ can stop all of that. Ativan stops the clusters too and put be to sleep. If MJ put me to sleep I would still use it, but it wires me up. But I have huge sleep problems.

Re: Medical Marijuana As An Alternative Herbal Therapy Submitted by Sarah24 on Thu, 2009-04-30 - 10:22 I agree it has to be active in your body to work properly. I am sorry you could not control your \"high\" so you could function regularly. Like I have been saying, it is an alternative only for some. Just like any other therapy there are still side effects and some can handle/not experience them and some can't. I am sorry that your experience was not more helpful.

First of all, I am sorry that you have to experience watching others suffer so. It must be heart wrenching. Secondly, I know all about the liquid diets because of chewed tongues! 'Tis the sign of an epileptic I'm afraid :( Marijuana is amazing in pain control. That's another reason I will smoke after a seizure--to numb the pain from whatever injuries I have sustained during the seizures until I can sleep. It also helps me to sleep and I no longer have to take pharms to get to bed at night. Are you in a decriminalized state? If so, have you personally tried it to control your seizures? They may not allow you because of your profession but I'm just curious. Thanks Lovebug and best wishes, Sarah Hi! First of all, I am sorry that you have to experience watching others suffer so.

I agree that buying it safely from a caregiver or from a shop would be a MUCH better alternative (plus you get ripped off on the street). That is one reason I love the marijuana license--it also allows for personal growth in the home. That way I KNOW where and what my buds have been exposed to, and I am able to control the conditions in which it is grown easily whereas if you get it off of the street you truly cannot know.

I had to be with my father in law when he was sick and it was hard to watch him suffer. As for mj it has been a lifesaver for me as pills almost killed me. At one time in my life daily I ingested 23 pills in a 24 hour period. There was pills for sezuire ,aniexty, depression, pain, muscle relaxers, really some many I can't recall them all . May I ask how do the doctors feel about medcial MJ?? I know PILL PROFITS may fall soon here as many legal MJ patients reporting using less medications. Are you in a MJ friendly state??

I am hoping and praying that these marijuana decriminalization bills will spread like a fire through the USA. We are seeing very interesting times right now with our gov't and society as views and attitudes slowly shift in different directions. It is good to keep up on the newest states.
