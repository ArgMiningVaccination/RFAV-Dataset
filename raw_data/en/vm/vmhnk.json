For those nursing facilities in 75.18 each grouping whose case mix A operating cost per diem: 75.19 (i) is at or below the median minus 1.0 standard deviation 75.20 of the array, the commissioner shall limit the nursing 75.21 facility's allowable operating cost per diem for each case mix 75.22 category to the lesser of the prior reporting year's allowable 75.23 operating cost per diems plus the inflation factor as 75.24 established in paragraph (f), clause (2), increased by six 75.25 percentage points, or the current reporting year's corresponding 75.26 allowable operating cost per diem; 75.27 (ii) is between minus .5 standard deviation and minus 1.0 75.28 standard deviation below the median of the array, the 75.29 commissioner shall limit the nursing facility's allowable 75.30 operating cost per diem for each case mix category to the lesser 75.31 of the prior reporting year's allowable operating cost per diems 75.32 plus the inflation factor as established in paragraph (f), 75.33 clause (2), increased by four percentage points, or the current 75.34 reporting year's corresponding allowable operating cost per 75.35 diem; or 75.36 (iii) is equal to or above minus .5 standard deviation 76.1 below the median of the array, the commissioner shall limit the 76.2 nursing facility's allowable operating cost per diem for each 76.3 case mix category to the lesser of the prior reporting year's 76.4 allowable operating cost per diems plus the inflation factor as 76.5 established in paragraph (f), clause (2), increased by three 76.6 percentage points, or the current reporting year's corresponding 76.7 allowable operating cost per diem. 76.8 (2) For the rate year beginning on July 1, 1996, the 76.9 commissioner shall limit the nursing facility's allowable 76.10 operating cost per diem for each case mix category to the lesser 76.11 of the prior reporting year's allowable operating cost per diems 76.12 plus the inflation factor as established in paragraph (f), 76.13 clause (2), increased by one percentage point or the current 76.14 reporting year's corresponding allowable operating cost per 76.15 diems; and 76.16 (3) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the 76.17 commissioner shall limit the nursing facility's allowable 76.18 operating cost per diem for each case mix category to the lesser 76.19 of the reporting year prior to the current reporting year's 76.20 allowable operating cost per diems plus the inflation factor as 76.21 established in paragraph (f), clause (2), or the current 76.22 reporting year's corresponding allowable operating cost per 76.23 diems. 76.24 (c) For rate years beginning on July 1, 1995, the 76.25 commissioner shall limit the allowable operating cost per diems 76.26 for high cost nursing facilities. After application of the 76.27 limits in paragraph (b) to each nursing facility's operating 76.28 cost per diems, the commissioner shall group nursing facilities 76.29 into two groups, freestanding or nonfreestanding, within each 76.30 geographic group. A nonfreestanding nursing facility is a 76.31 nursing facility whose other operating cost per diems are 76.32 subject to hospital attached, short length of stay, or rule 80 76.33 limits. All other nursing facilities shall be considered 76.34 freestanding nursing facilities. The commissioner shall then 76.35 array all nursing facilities within each grouping by their 76.36 allowable case mix A operating cost per diems. In calculating a 77.1 nursing facility's operating cost per diem for this purpose, the 77.2 commissioner shall exclude the raw food cost per diem related to 77.3 providing special diets that are based on religious beliefs, as 77.4 determined in subdivision 2b, paragraph (h). For those nursing 77.5 facilities in each grouping whose case mix A operating cost per 77.6 diem exceeds 1.0 standard deviation above the median, the 77.7 commissioner shall reduce their allowable operating cost per 77.8 diems by two percent. For those nursing facilities in each 77.9 grouping whose case mix A operating cost per diem exceeds 0.5 77.10 standard deviation above the median but is less than or equal to 77.11 1.0 standard deviation above the median, the commissioner shall 77.12 reduce their allowable operating cost per diems by one percent. 77.13 (d) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1996, the 77.14 commissioner shall limit the allowable operating cost per diems 77.15 for high cost nursing facilities. After application of the 77.16 limits in paragraph (b) to each nursing facility's operating 77.17 cost per diems, the commissioner shall group nursing facilities 77.18 into two groups, freestanding or nonfreestanding, within each 77.19 geographic group. A nonfreestanding nursing facility is a 77.20 nursing facility whose other operating cost per diems are 77.21 subject to hospital attached, short length of stay, or rule 80 77.22 limits. All other nursing facilities shall be considered 77.23 freestanding nursing facilities. The commissioner shall then 77.24 array all nursing facilities within each grouping by their 77.25 allowable case mix A operating cost per diems. In calculating a 77.26 nursing facility's operating cost per diem for this purpose, the 77.27 commissioner shall exclude the raw food cost per diem related to 77.28 providing special diets that are based on religious beliefs, as 77.29 determined in subdivision 2b, paragraph (h). In those nursing 77.30 facilities in each grouping whose case mix A operating cost per 77.31 diem exceeds 1.0 standard deviation above the median, the 77.32 commissioner shall reduce their allowable operating cost per 77.33 diems by three percent. For those nursing facilities in each 77.34 grouping whose case mix A operating cost per diem exceeds 0.5 77.35 standard deviation above the median but is less than or equal to 77.36 1.0 standard deviation above the median, the commissioner shall 78.1 reduce their allowable operating cost per diems by two percent. 78.2 (e) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1995, the 78.3 commissioner shall determine a nursing facility's efficiency 78.4 incentive by first computing the allowable difference, which is 78.5 the lesser of $4.50 or the amount by which the facility's other 78.6 operating cost limit exceeds its nonadjusted other operating 78.7 cost per diem for that rate year. The commissioner shall 78.8 compute the efficiency incentive by: 78.9 (1) subtracting the allowable difference from $4.50 and 78.10 dividing the result by $4.50; 78.11 (2) multiplying 0.20 by the ratio resulting from clause 78.12 (1), and then; 78.13 (3) adding 0.50 to the result from clause (2); and 78.14 (4) multiplying the result from clause (3) times the 78.15 allowable difference. 78.16 The nursing facility's efficiency incentive payment shall 78.17 be the lesser of $2.25 or the product obtained in clause (4). 78.18 (f) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1995, the 78.19 forecasted price index for a nursing facility's allowable 78.20 operating cost per diems shall be determined under clauses (1) 78.21 to (3) using the change in the Consumer Price Index-All Items 78.22 (United States city average) (CPI-U) or the change in the 78.23 Nursing Home Market Basket, both as forecasted by Data Resources 78.24 Inc., whichever is applicable. The commissioner shall use the 78.25 indices as forecasted in the fourth quarter of the calendar year 78.26 preceding the rate year, subject to subdivision 2l, paragraph 78.27 (c). If, as a result of federal legislative or administrative 78.28 action, the methodology used to calculate the Consumer Price 78.29 Index-All Items (United States city average) (CPI-U) changes, 78.30 the commissioner shall develop a conversion factor or other 78.31 methodology to convert the CPI-U index factor that results from 78.32 the new methodology to an index factor that approximates, as 78.33 closely as possible, the index factor that would have resulted 78.34 from application of the original CPI-U methodology prior to any 78.35 changes in methodology. The commissioner shall use the 78.36 conversion factor or other methodology to calculate an adjusted 79.1 inflation index. The adjusted inflation index must be used to 79.2 calculate payment rates under this section instead of the CPI-U 79.3 index specified in paragraph (d). If the commissioner is 79.4 required to develop an adjusted inflation index, the 79.5 commissioner shall report to the legislature as part of the next 79.6 budget submission the fiscal impact of applying this index. 79.7 (1) The CPI-U forecasted index for allowable operating cost 79.8 per diems shall be based on the 21-month period from the 79.9 midpoint of the nursing facility's reporting year to the 79.10 midpoint of the rate year following the reporting year. 79.11 (2) The Nursing Home Market Basket forecasted index for 79.12 allowable operating costs and per diem limits shall be based on 79.13 the 12-month period between the midpoints of the two reporting 79.14 years preceding the rate year. 79.15 (3) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1996, the 79.16 forecasted index for operating cost limits referred to in 79.17 subdivision 21, paragraph (b), shall be based on the CPI-U for 79.18 the 12-month period between the midpoints of the two reporting 79.19 years preceding the rate year. 79.20 (g) After applying these provisions for the respective rate 79.21 years, the commissioner shall index these allowable operating 79.22 costs per diems by the inflation factor provided for in 79.23 paragraph (f), clause (1), and add the nursing facility's 79.24 efficiency incentive as computed in paragraph (e). 79.25 (h)(1) A nursing facility licensed for 302 beds on 79.26 September 30, 1993, that was approved under the moratorium 79.27 exception process in section 144A.073 for a partial replacement, 79.28 and completed the replacement project in December 1994, is 79.29 exempt from paragraphs (b) to (d) for rate years beginning on or 79.30 after July 1, 1995. 79.31 (2) For the rate year beginning July 1, 1997, after 79.32 computing this nursing facility's payment rate according to 79.33 section 256B.434, the commissioner shall make a one-year rate 79.34 adjustment of $8.62 to the facility's contract payment rate for 79.35 the rate effect of operating cost changes associated with the 79.36 facility's 1994 downsizing project. 80.1 (3) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the 80.2 commissioner shall add 35 cents to the facility's base property 80.3 related payment rate for the rate effect of reducing its 80.4 licensed capacity to 290 beds from 302 beds and shall add 83 80.5 cents to the facility's real estate tax and special assessment 80.6 payment rate for payments in lieu of real estate taxes. The 80.7 adjustments in this clause shall remain in effect for the 80.8 duration of the facility's contract under section 256B.434. 80.9 (i) Notwithstanding Laws 1996, chapter 451, article 3, 80.10 section 11, paragraph (h), for the rate years beginning on July 80.11 1, 1996, July 1, 1997, and July 1, 1998, a nursing facility 80.12 licensed for 40 beds effective May 1, 1992, with a subsequent 80.13 increase of 20 Medicare/Medicaid certified beds, effective 80.14 January 26, 1993, in accordance with an increase in licensure is 80.15 exempt from paragraphs (b) to (d). 80.16 Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256B.431, is 80.17 amended by adding a subdivision to read: 80.18 Subd. 26. [CHANGES TO NURSING FACILITY REIMBURSEMENT 80.19 BEGINNING JULY 1, 1997.] The nursing facility reimbursement 80.20 changes in paragraphs (a) to (f) shall apply in the sequence 80.21 specified in Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0010 to 9549.0080, and 80.22 this section, beginning July 1, 1997. 80.23 (a) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the 80.24 commissioner shall limit a nursing facility's allowable 80.25 operating per diem for each case mix category for each rate year. 80.26 The commissioner shall group nursing facilities into two groups, 80.27 freestanding and nonfreestanding, within each geographic group, 80.28 using their operating cost per diem for the case mix A 80.29 classification. A nonfreestanding nursing facility is a nursing 80.30 facility whose other operating cost per diem is subject to the 80.31 hospital attached, short length of stay, or the rule 80 limits. 80.32 All other nursing facilities shall be considered freestanding 80.33 nursing facilities. The commissioner shall then array all 80.34 nursing facilities in each grouping by their allowable case mix 80.35 A operating cost per diem. In calculating a nursing facility's 80.36 operating cost per diem for this purpose, the commissioner shall 81.1 exclude the raw food cost per diem related to providing special 81.2 diets that are based on religious beliefs, as determined in 81.3 subdivision 2b, paragraph (h). For those nursing facilities in 81.4 each grouping whose case mix A operating cost per diem: 81.5 (1) is at or below the median of the array, the 81.6 commissioner shall limit the nursing facility's allowable 81.7 operating cost per diem for each case mix category to the lesser 81.8 of the prior reporting year's allowable operating cost per diem 81.9 as specified in Laws 1996, chapter 451, article 3, section 11, 81.10 paragraph (h), plus the inflation factor as established in 81.11 paragraph (d), clause (2), increased by two percentage points, 81.12 or the current reporting year's corresponding allowable 81.13 operating cost per diem; or 81.14 (2) is above the median of the array, the commissioner 81.15 shall limit the nursing facility's allowable operating cost per 81.16 diem for each case mix category to the lesser of the prior 81.17 reporting year's allowable operating cost per diem as specified 81.18 in Laws 1996, chapter 451, article 3, section 11, paragraph (h), 81.19 plus the inflation factor as established in paragraph (d), 81.20 clause (2), increased by one percentage point, or the current 81.21 reporting year's corresponding allowable operating cost per diem. 81.22 (b) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the 81.23 commissioner shall limit the allowable operating cost per diem 81.24 for high cost nursing facilities. After application of the 81.25 limits in paragraph (a) to each nursing facility's operating 81.26 cost per diem, the commissioner shall group nursing facilities 81.27 into two groups, freestanding or nonfreestanding, within each 81.28 geographic group. A nonfreestanding nursing facility is a 81.29 nursing facility whose other operating cost per diem are subject 81.30 to hospital attached, short length of stay, or rule 80 limits. 81.31 All other nursing facilities shall be considered freestanding 81.32 nursing facilities. The commissioner shall then array all 81.33 nursing facilities within each grouping by their allowable case 81.34 mix A operating cost per diem. In calculating a nursing 81.35 facility's operating cost per diem for this purpose, the 81.36 commissioner shall exclude the raw food cost per diem related to 82.1 providing special diets that are based on religious beliefs, as 82.2 determined in subdivision 2b, paragraph (h). For those nursing 82.3 facilities in each grouping whose case mix A operating cost per 82.4 diem exceeds 1.0 standard deviation above the median, the 82.5 commissioner shall reduce their allowable operating cost per 82.6 diem by three percent. For those nursing facilities in each 82.7 grouping whose case mix A operating cost per diem exceeds 0.5 82.8 standard deviation above the median but is less than or equal to 82.9 1.0 standard deviation above the median, the commissioner shall 82.10 reduce their allowable operating cost per diem by two percent. 82.11 However, in no case shall a nursing facility's operating cost 82.12 per diem be reduced below its grouping's limit established at 82.13 0.5 standard deviations above the median. 82.14 (c) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the 82.15 commissioner shall determine a nursing facility's efficiency 82.16 incentive by first computing the allowable difference, which is 82.17 the lesser of $4.50 or the amount by which the facility's other 82.18 operating cost limit exceeds its nonadjusted other operating 82.19 cost per diem for that rate year. The commissioner shall 82.20 compute the efficiency incentive by: 82.21 (1) subtracting the allowable difference from $4.50 and 82.22 dividing the result by $4.50; 82.23 (2) multiplying 0.20 by the ratio resulting from clause 82.24 (1), and then; 82.25 (3) adding 0.50 to the result from clause (2); and 82.26 (4) multiplying the result from clause (3) times the 82.27 allowable difference. 82.28 The nursing facility's efficiency incentive payment shall 82.29 be the lesser of $2.25 or the product obtained in clause (4). 82.30 (d) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the 82.31 forecasted price index for a nursing facility's allowable 82.32 operating cost per diem shall be determined under clauses (1) 82.33 and (2) using the change in the Consumer Price Index-All Items 82.34 (United States city average) (CPI-U) as forecasted by Data 82.35 Resources, Inc. The commissioner shall use the indices as 82.36 forecasted in the fourth quarter of the calendar year preceding 83.1 the rate year, subject to subdivision 2l, paragraph (c). 83.2 (1) The CPI-U forecasted index for allowable operating cost 83.3 per diem shall be based on the 21-month period from the midpoint 83.4 of the nursing facility's reporting year to the midpoint of the 83.5 rate year following the reporting year. 83.6 (2) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the 83.7 forecasted index for operating cost limits referred to in 83.8 subdivision 21, paragraph (b), shall be based on the CPI-U for 83.9 the 12-month period between the midpoints of the two reporting 83.10 years preceding the rate year. 83.11 (e) After applying these provisions for the respective rate 83.12 years, the commissioner shall index these allowable operating 83.13 cost per diem by the inflation factor provided for in paragraph 83.14 (d), clause (1), and add the nursing facility's efficiency 83.15 incentive as computed in paragraph (c). 83.16 (f) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the 83.17 total operating cost payment rates for a nursing facility shall 83.18 be the greater of the total operating cost payment rates 83.19 determined under this section or the total operating cost 83.20 payment rates in effect on June 30, 1997, subject to rate 83.21 adjustments due to field audit or rate appeal resolution. This 83.22 provision shall not apply to subsequent field audit adjustments 83.23 of the nursing facility's operating cost rates for rate years 83.24 beginning on or after July 1, 1997. 83.25 (g) For the rate years beginning on July 1, 1997, and July 83.26 1, 1998, a nursing facility licensed for 40 beds effective May 83.27 1, 1992, with a subsequent increase of 20 Medicare/Medicaid 83.28 certified beds, effective January 26, 1993, in accordance with 83.29 an increase in licensure is exempt from paragraphs (a) and (b). 83.30 (h) For a nursing facility whose construction project was 83.31 authorized according to section 144A.073, subdivision 5, 83.32 paragraph (g), the operating cost payment rates for the third 83.33 location shall be determined based on Minnesota Rules, part 83.34 9549.0057. Paragraphs (a) and (b) shall not apply until the 83.35 second rate year after the settle-up cost report is filed. 83.36 Notwithstanding subdivision 2b, paragraph (g), real estate taxes 84.1 and special assessments payable by the third location, a 84.2 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation, shall be included in the 84.3 payment rates determined under this subdivision for all 84.4 subsequent rate years. 84.5 (i) For the rate year beginning July 1, 1997, the 84.6 commissioner shall compute the payment rate for a nursing 84.7 facility licensed for 94 beds on September 30, 1996, that 84.8 applied in October 1993 for approval of a total replacement 84.9 under the moratorium exception process in section 144A.073, and 84.10 completed the approved replacement in June 1995, with other 84.11 operating cost spend-up limit under paragraph (a), increased by 84.12 $3.98, and after computing the facility's payment rate according 84.13 to this section, the commissioner shall make a one-year positive 84.14 rate adjustment of $3.19 for operating costs related to the 84.15 newly constructed total replacement, without application of 84.16 paragraphs (a) and (b). The facility's per diem, before the 84.17 $3.19 adjustment, shall be used as the prior reporting year's 84.18 allowable operating cost per diem for payment rate calculation 84.19 for the rate year beginning July 1, 1998. A facility described 84.20 in this paragraph is exempt from paragraph (b) for the rate 84.21 years beginning July 1, 1997, and July 1, 1998. 84.22 (j) For the purpose of applying the limit stated in 84.23 paragraph (a), a nursing facility in Kandiyohi county licensed 84.24 for 86 beds that was granted hospital-attached status on 84.25 December 1, 1994, shall have the prior year's allowable 84.26 care-related per diem increased by $3.207 and the prior year's 84.27 other operating cost per diem increased by $4.777 before adding 84.28 the inflation in paragraph (d), clause (2), for the rate year 84.29 beginning on July 1, 1997. 84.30 (k) For the purpose of applying the limit stated in 84.31 paragraph (a), a 117 bed nursing facility located in Pine county 84.32 shall have the prior year's allowable other operating cost per 84.33 diem increased by $1.50 before adding the inflation in paragraph 84.34 (d), clause (2), for the rate year beginning on July 1, 1997. 84.35 (l) For the purpose of applying the limit under paragraph 84.36 (a), a nursing facility in Hibbing licensed for 192 beds shall 85.1 have the prior year's allowable other operating cost per diem 85.2 increased by $2.67 before adding the inflation in paragraph (d), 85.3 clause (2), for the rate year beginning July 1, 1997. 85.4 Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256B.433, is 85.5 amended by adding a subdivision to read: 85.6 Subd. 3a. [EXEMPTION FROM REQUIREMENT FOR SEPARATE THERAPY 85.7 BILLING.] The provisions of subdivision 3 do not apply to 85.8 nursing facilities that are reimbursed according to the 85.9 provisions of section 256B.431 and are located in a county 85.10 participating in the prepaid medical assistance program. 85.11 Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256B.434, 85.12 subdivision 3, is amended to read: 85.13 Subd. 3. [DURATION AND TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS.] (a) 85.14 Subject to available resources, the commissioner may begin to 85.15 execute contracts with nursing facilities November 1, 1995. 85.16 (b) All contracts entered into under this section are for a 85.17 term of four yearsone year. Either party may terminate a 85.18 contract effective July 1 of any year by providing written85.19 notice to the other party no later than April 1 of that yearat 85.20 any time without cause by providing 30 calendar days advance 85.21 written notice to the other party. The decision to terminate a 85.22 contract is not appealable. If neither party provides written 85.23 notice of termination by April 1, the contract is automatically85.24 renewed for the next rate yearthe contract shall be 85.25 renegotiated for additional one-year terms, for up to a total of 85.26 four consecutive one-year terms. The provisions of the contract 85.27 shall be renegotiated annually by the parties prior to the 85.28 expiration date of the contract. The parties may voluntarily 85.29 renegotiate the terms of the contract at any time by mutual 85.30 agreement. 85.31 (c) If a nursing facility fails to comply with the terms of 85.32 a contract, the commissioner shall provide reasonable notice 85.33 regarding the breach of contract and a reasonable opportunity 85.34 for the facility to come into compliance. If the facility fails 85.35 to come into compliance or to remain in compliance, the 85.36 commissioner may terminate the contract. If a contract is 86.1 terminated, the contract payment remains in effect for the 86.2 remainder of the rate year in which the contract was terminated, 86.3 but in all other respects the provisions of this section do not 86.4 apply to that facility effective the date the contract is 86.5 terminated. The contract shall contain a provision governing 86.6 the transition back to the cost-based reimbursement system 86.7 established under section 256B.431, subdivision 25, and 86.8 Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0010 to 9549.0080.

[MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS FOR OTHER SERVICES.] 86.14 Beginning July 1, 1995, the commissioner may contract with 86.15 nursing facilities that have entered into alternative payment 86.16 demonstration project contracts under this section to provide 86.17 medical assistance services other than nursing facility care to 86.18 residents of the facility under a prepaid, managed care payment 86.19 system. For purposes of contracts entered into under this86.20 subdivision, the commissioner may waive one or more of the86.21 requirements for payment for ancillary services in section86.22 256B.433.Managed care contracts for other services may be 86.23 entered into at any time during the duration of a nursing 86.24 facility's alternative payment demonstration project contract, 86.25 and the terms of the managed care contracts need not coincide 86.26 with the terms of the alternative payment demonstration project 86.27 contract. 86.28 Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256B.434, 86.29 subdivision 10, is amended to read: 86.30 Subd. 10.

The 148.2 allocation for fiscal year 1992 shall be calculated using a base 148.3 that is adjusted to exclude the medical assistance share of 148.4 alternative care expenditures. The adjusted base is calculated 148.5 by multiplying each county's allocation for fiscal year 1991 by 148.6 the percentage of county alternative care expenditures for 148.7 180-day eligible clients. The percentage is determined based on 148.8 expenditures for services rendered in fiscal year 1989 or 148.9 calendar year 1989, whichever is greater. 148.10 (c) If the county expenditures for 180-day eligible clients 148.11 are 95 percent or more of its adjusted base allocation, the 148.12 allocation for the next fiscal year is 100 percent of the 148.13 adjusted base, plus inflation to the extent that inflation is 148.14 included in the state budget. 148.15 (d) If the county expenditures for 180-day eligible clients 148.16 are less than 95 percent of its adjusted base allocation, the 148.17 allocation for the next fiscal year is the adjusted base 148.18 allocation less the amount of unspent funds below the 95 percent 148.19 level. 148.20 (e) For fiscal year 1992 only, a county may receive an 148.21 increased allocation if annualized service costs for the month 148.22 of May 1991 for 180-day eligible clients are greater than the 148.23 allocation otherwise determined. A county may apply for this 148.24 increase by reporting projected expenditures for May to the 148.25 commissioner by June 1, 1991. The amount of the allocation may 148.26 exceed the amount calculated in paragraph (b). The projected 148.27 expenditures for May must be based on actual 180-day eligible 148.28 client caseload and the individual cost of clients' care plans. 148.29 If a county does not report its expenditures for May, the amount 148.30 in paragraph (c) or (d) shall be used. 148.31 (f) Calculations for paragraphs (c) and (d) are to be made 148.32 as follows: for each county, the determination of expenditures 148.33 shall be based on payments for services rendered from April 1 148.34 through March 31 in the base year, to the extent that claims 148.35 have been submitted by June 1 of that year. Calculations for 148.36 paragraphs (c) and (d) must also include the funds transferred 149.1 to the consumer support grant program for clients who have 149.2 transferred to that program from April 1 through March 31 in the 149.3 base year. 149.4 Sec. 38.

Quarterly reports are due no later than 30 191.10 calendar days after the end of the quarter, unless the 191.11 commissioner determines that the deadline must be shortened to 191.12 20 calendar days to avoid jeopardizing compliance with federal 191.13 deadlines or risking a loss of federal funding. Only reports 191.14 that are complete, legible, and in the required format shall be 191.15 accepted by the commissioner. 191.16 (c) If the required reports are not received by the 191.17 deadlines established in clause (b), the commissioner may delay 191.18 payments and withhold funds from the county board until the next 191.19 reporting period. When the report is needed to account for the 191.20 use of federal funds and the late report results in a reduction 191.21 in federal funding, the commissioner shall withhold from the 191.22 county boards with late reports an amount equal to the reduction 191.23 in federal funding until full federal funding is received. 191.24 (d) A county board that submits reports that are late, 191.25 illegible, incomplete, or not in the required format for two out 191.26 of three consecutive reporting periods is considered 191.27 noncompliant. When a county board is found to be noncompliant, 191.28 the commissioner shall notify the county board of the reason the 191.29 county board is considered noncompliant and request that the 191.30 county board develop a corrective action plan stating how the 191.31 county board plans to correct the problem. The corrective 191.32 action plan must be submitted to the commissioner within 45 days 191.33 after the date the county board received notice of noncompliance. 191.34 (e) The final deadline for fiscal reports or amendments to 191.35 fiscal reports is one year after the date the report was 191.36 originally due.

If the 192.10 county board disagrees with an action taken by the commissioner 192.11 under paragraph (c) or (e), the county board may appeal the 192.12 action according to sections 14.57 to 14.69. 192.13 (g) Counties subject to withholding of funds under 192.14 paragraph (c) or forfeiture or repayment of funds under 192.15 paragraph (e) shall not reduce or withhold benefits or services 192.16 to clients to cover costs incurred due to actions taken by the 192.17 commissioner under paragraph (c) or (e). 192.18 (18) Allocate federal fiscal disallowances or sanctions for 192.19 audit exceptions when federal fiscal disallowances or sanctions 192.20 are based on a statewide random sample for the foster care 192.21 program under title IV-E of the Social Security Act, United 192.22 States Code, title 42, in direct proportion to each county's 192.23 title IV-E foster care maintenance claim for that period. 192.24 Sec. 5.

[DETERMINATIONS.] Upon the conclusion of every 222.28 assessment or investigation it conducts, the local welfare 222.29 agency shall make two determinations: first, whether 222.30 maltreatment has occurred; and second, whether child protective 222.31 services are needed.

Determinations under this subdivision must be 222.36 made based on a preponderance of the evidence. 223.1 (a) For the purposes of this subdivision, \"maltreatment\" 223.2 means any of the following acts or omissions committed by a 223.3 person responsible for the child's care: 223.4 (1) physical abuse as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph 223.5 (d); 223.6 (2) neglect as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (c); 223.7 (3) sexual abuse as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph 223.8 (a); or 223.9 (4) mental injury as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph 223.10 (k). 223.11 (b) For the purposes of this subdivision, a determination 223.12 that child protective services are needed means that the local 223.13 welfare agency has documented conditions during the assessment 223.14 or investigation sufficient to cause a child protection worker, 223.15 as defined in section 626.559, subdivision 1, to conclude that a 223.16 child is at significant risk of maltreatment if protective 223.17 intervention is not provided and that the individuals 223.18 responsible for the child's care have not taken or are not 223.19 likely to take actions to protect the child from maltreatment or 223.20 risk of maltreatment. 223.21 (c) This subdivision does not mean that maltreatment has 223.22 occurred solely because the child's parent, guardian, or other 223.23 person responsible for the child's care in good faith selects 223.24 and depends upon spiritual means or prayer for treatment or care 223.25 of disease or remedial care of the child, in lieu of medical 223.26 care. However, if lack of medical care may result in serious 223.27 danger to the child's health, the local welfare agency may 223.28 ensure that necessary medical services are provided to the child. 223.29 (d) When determining whether the facility or individual is 223.30 the responsible party for determined maltreatment in a facility, 223.31 the investigating agency shall consider at least the following 223.32 mitigating factors: 223.33 (1) whether the actions of the facility or the individual 223.34 caregivers were according to, and followed the terms of, an 223.35 erroneous physician order, prescription, individual care plan, 223.36 or directive; however, this is not a mitigating factor when the 224.1 facility or caregiver was responsible for the issuance of the 224.2 erroneous order, prescription, individual care plan, or 224.3 directive or knew or should have known of the errors and took no 224.4 reasonable measures to correct the defect before administering 224.5 care; 224.6 (2) comparative responsibility between the facility, other 224.7 caregivers, and requirements placed upon an employee, including 224.8 the facility's compliance with related regulatory standards and 224.9 the adequacy of facility policies and procedures, facility 224.10 training, an individual's participation in the training, the 224.11 caregiver's supervision, and facility staffing levels and the 224.12 scope of the individual employee's authority and discretion; and 224.13 (3) whether the facility or individual followed 224.14 professional standards in exercising professional judgment. 224.15 Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 626.556, 224.16 OF DETERMINATIONS.] Within ten working 224.18 days of the conclusion of an assessment, the local welfare 224.19 agency shall notify the parent or guardian of the child, the 224.20 person determined to be maltreating the child, and if 224.21 applicable, the director of the facility, of the determination 224.22 and a summary of the specific reasons for the determination. 224.23 The notice must also include a certification that the 224.24 information collection procedures under subdivision 10, 224.25 paragraphs (h), (i), and (j), were followed and a notice of the 224.26 right of a data subject to obtain access to other private data 224.27 on the subject collected, created, or maintained under this 224.28 section. In addition, the notice shall include the length of 224.29 time that the records will be kept under subdivision 11c. When 224.30 there is no determination of either maltreatment or a need for 224.31 services, the notice shall also include the alleged 224.32 perpetrator's right to have the records destroyed. The 224.33 investigating agency shall notify the designee of the child who 224.34 is the subject of the report, and any person or facility 224.35 determined to have maltreated a child, of their appeal rights 224.36 under this section. 225.1 Sec. 29.

Failure to provide this 244.25 evidence shall result in the child support agency resuming child 244.26 support enforcement efforts. 244.27 (b) Evidence supporting a good cause claim includes, but is 244.28 not limited to: 244.29 (1) a birth certificate or medical or law enforcement 244.30 records indicating that the child was conceived as the result of 244.31 incest or rape; 244.32 (2) court documents or other records indicating that legal 244.33 proceedings for adoption are pending before a court of competent 244.34 jurisdiction; 244.35 (3) court, medical, criminal, child protective services, 244.36 social services, domestic violence advocate services, 245.1 psychological, or law enforcement records indicating that the 245.2 alleged father or obligor might inflict physical or emotional 245.3 harm on the child, parent, or caregiver; 245.4 (4) medical records or written statements from a licensed 245.5 medical professional indicating the emotional health history or 245.6 status of the custodial parent, child, or caregiver, or 245.7 indicating a diagnosis or prognosis concerning their emotional 245.8 health; 245.9 (5) a written statement from a public or licensed private 245.10 social services agency that the individual is deciding whether 245.11 to keep the child or place the child for adoption; or 245.12 (6) sworn statements from individuals other than the 245.13 applicant or recipient that provide evidence supporting the good 245.14 cause claim. 245.15 (c) The child support agency and the public assistance 245.16 agency shall assist an individual in obtaining the evidence in 245.17 this section upon request of the individual. 245.18 Subd. 12. [DECISION.] A good cause exemption must be 245.19 granted if the individual's claim and the investigation of the 245.20 supporting evidence satisfy the investigating agencies that the 245.21 individual has good cause for refusing to cooperate. 245.22 Subd. 13. [DURATION.] (a) A good cause exemption may not 245.23 continue for more than one year without redetermination of 245.24 cooperation and good cause pursuant to this section. The child 245.25 support agency may redetermine cooperation and the designated 245.26 representatives in subdivision 10 may redetermine the granting 245.27 of a good cause exemption before the one year expiration in this 245.28 subdivision. 245.29 (b) A good cause exemption must be allowed under subsequent 245.30 applications and redeterminations without additional evidence 245.31 when the factors that led to the exemption continue to exist.

A mother or alleged father requesting 255.1 the tests shall file with the court an affidavit either alleging 255.2 or denying paternity and setting forth facts that establish the 255.3 reasonable possibility that there was, or was not, the requisite 255.4 sexual contact between the parties. 255.5 (b) A copy of the test results must be served on the255.6 parties as provided in section 543.20each party by first class 255.7 mail to the party's last known address.

Unless the person gives 255.22 consent to the use, the results of any blood or genetic tests of 255.23 the decedent's parents, brothers, or sisters may be used only to 255.24 establish the right of the child to public assistance including 255.25 but not limited to social security and veterans' benefits.

The remaining matters and all subsequent motions 256.13 related to them shall proceed and be determined in accordance 256.14 with chapter 518. The judgment or order may direct the 256.15 appropriate party to pay all or a proportion of the reasonable 256.16 expenses of the mother's pregnancy and confinement, after 256.17 consideration of the relevant facts, including the relative 256.18 financial means of the parents; the earning ability of each 256.19 parent; and any health insurance policies held by either parent, 256.20 or by a spouse or parent of the parent, which would provide 256.21 benefits for the expenses incurred by the mother during her 256.22 pregnancy and confinement.

Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 257.75, 258.3 subdivision 2, is amended to read: 258.4 Subd. 2. [REVOCATION OF RECOGNITION.] A recognition may be 258.5 revoked in a writing signed by the mother or father before a 258.6 notary public and filed with the state registrar of vital 258.7 statistics within the earlier of 30 days after the recognition 258.8 is executed or the date of an administrative or judicial hearing 258.9 relating to the child in which the revoking party is a party to 258.10 the related action. A joinder in a recognition may be revoked 258.11 in a writing signed by the man who executed the joinder and 258.12 filed with the state registrar of vital statistics within 30 258.13 days after the joinder is executed. Upon receipt of a 258.14 revocation of the recognition of parentage or joinder in a 258.15 recognition, the state registrar of vital statistics shall 258.16 forward a copy of the revocation to the nonrevoking parent, or, 258.17 in the case of a joinder in a recognition, to the mother and 258.18 father who executed the recognition. 258.19 Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 257.75, 258.20 subdivision 3, is amended to read: 258.21 Subd. 3. [EFFECT OF RECOGNITION.] Subject to subdivision 2 258.22 and section 257.55, subdivision 1, paragraph (g) or (h), the 258.23 recognition has the force and effect of a judgment or order 258.24 determining the existence of the parent and child relationship 258.25 under section 257.66. If the conditions in section 257.55, 258.26 subdivision 1, paragraph (g) or (h), exist, the recognition 258.27 creates only a presumption of paternity for purposes of sections 258.28 257.51 to 257.74. Once a recognition has been properly executed 258.29 and filed with the state registrar of vital statistics, if there 258.30 are no competing presumptions of paternity, a judicial or 258.31 administrative court may not allow further action to determine 258.32 parentage regarding the signator of the recognition. Until an 258.33 order is entered granting custody to another, the mother has 258.34 sole custody. The recognition is: 258.35 (1) a basis for bringing an action to award custody or 258.36 visitation rights to either parent, establishing a child support 259.1 obligation which may include up to the two years immediately 259.2 preceding the commencement of the action, ordering a 259.3 contribution by a parent under section 256.87, or ordering a 259.4 contribution to the reasonable expenses of the mother's 259.5 pregnancy and confinement, as provided under section 257.66, 259.6 subdivision 3, or ordering reimbursement for the costs of blood 259.7 or genetic testing, as provided under section 257.69, 259.8 subdivision 2; 259.9 (2) determinative for all other purposes related to the 259.10 existence of the parent and child relationship; and 259.11 (3) entitled to full faith and credit in other 259.12 jurisdictions. 259.13 Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 257.75, 259.14 subdivision 4, is amended to read: 259.15 Subd. 4. [ACTION TO VACATE RECOGNITION.] (a) An action to 259.16 vacate a recognition of paternity may be brought by the mother, 259.17 father, husband or former husband who executed a joinder, or the 259.18 child. A mother, father, or husband or former husband who 259.19 executed a joinder must bring the action within one year of the 259.20 execution of the recognition or within six months after the 259.21 person bringing the action obtains the results of blood or 259.22 genetic tests that indicate that the man who executed the 259.23 recognition is not the father of the child. A child must bring 259.24 an action to vacate within six months after the child obtains 259.25 the result of blood or genetic tests that indicate that the man 259.26 who executed the recognition is not the father of the child, or 259.27 within one year of reaching the age of majority, whichever is 259.28 later. If the court finds a prima facie basis for vacating the 259.29 recognition, the court shall order the child, mother, father, 259.30 and husband or former husband who executed a joinder to submit 259.31 to blood tests. If the court issues an order for the taking of 259.32 blood tests, the court shall require the party seeking to vacate 259.33 the recognition to make advance payment for the costs of the 259.34 blood tests. If the party fails to pay for the costs of the 259.35 blood tests, the court shall dismiss the action to vacate with 259.36 prejudice. The court may also order the party seeking to vacate 260.1 the recognition to pay the other party's reasonable attorney 260.2 fees, costs, and disbursements. If the results of the blood 260.3 tests establish that the man who executed the recognition is not 260.4 the father, the court shall vacate the recognition. If a 260.5 recognition is vacated, any joinder in the recognition under 260.6 subdivision 1a is also vacated. The court shall terminate the 260.7 obligation of a party to pay ongoing child support based on the 260.8 recognition. A modification of child support based on a 260.9 recognition may be made retroactive with respect to any period 260.10 during which the moving party has pending a motion to vacate the 260.11 recognition but only from the date of service of notice of the 260.12 motion on the responding party. 260.13 (b) The burden of proof in an action to vacate the 260.14 recognition is on the moving party. The moving party must 260.15 request the vacation on the basis of fraud, duress, or material 260.16 mistake of fact. The legal responsibilities in existence at the 260.17 time of an action to vacate, including child support 260.18 obligations, may not be suspended during the proceeding, except 260.19 for good cause shown. 260.20 Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 257.75, 260.21 subdivision 5, is amended to read: 260.22 Subd. 5. [RECOGNITION FORM.] The commissioner of human 260.23 services shall prepare a form for the recognition of parentage 260.24 under this section. In preparing the form, the commissioner 260.25 shall consult with the individuals specified in subdivision 6. 260.26 The recognition form must be drafted so that the force and 260.27 effect of the recognition, the alternatives to executing a 260.28 recognition, and the benefits and responsibilities of 260.29 establishing paternity are clear and understandable. The form 260.30 must include a notice regarding the finality of a recognition 260.31 and the revocation procedure under subdivision 2. The form must 260.32 include a provision for each parent to verify that the parent 260.33 has read or viewed the educational materials prepared by the 260.34 commissioner of human services describing the recognition of 260.35 paternity. The individual providing the form to the parents for 260.36 execution shall provide oral notice of the rights, 261.1 responsibilities, and alternatives to executing the 261.2 recognition. Notice may be provided by audiotape, videotape, or 261.3 similar means. Each parent must receive a copy of the 261.4 recognition. 261.5 Sec. 30.

[ORAL DISCLOSURE.] Before or after the service of 324.16 a written disclosure by a third party under subdivision 5, upon 324.17 a showing by affidavit upon information and belief that an oral 324.18 examination of the third party would provide a complete 324.19 disclosure of relevant facts, any party to the execution 324.20 proceedings may obtain an ex parte order requiring the third 324.21 party, or a representative of the third party designated by name 324.22 or by title, to appear for oral examination before the court or 324.23 a referee appointed by the court.

[SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT.] If a third party holds 324.26 property, money, earnings, or other indebtedness by a title that 324.27 is void as to the judgment debtor's creditors, the property may 324.28 be levied on although the judgment debtor would be barred from 324.29 maintaining an action to recover the property, money, earnings, 324.30 or other indebtedness. In this and all other cases where the 324.31 third party denies liability, the public authority may move the 324.32 court at any time before the third party is discharged, on 324.33 notice to both the judgment debtor and the third party for an 324.34 order making the third party a party to supplemental action and 324.35 granting the public authority leave to file a supplemental 324.36 complaint against the third party and the judgment debtor. The 324.37 supplemental complaint shall set forth the facts upon which the 324.38 public authority claims to charge the third party. If probable 325.1 cause is shown, the motion shall be granted. The supplemental 325.2 complaint shall be served upon the third party and the judgment 325.3 debtor and any other parties. The parties served shall answer 325.4 or respond pursuant to the Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure 325.5 for the district courts, and if they fail to do so, judgment by 325.6 default may be entered against them. 325.7 Subd. 8. [JUDGMENT AGAINST THIRD PARTY UPON FAILURE TO 325.8 DISCLOSE OR REMIT.] Judgment may be entered against a third 325.9 party who has been served with a notice of support judgment levy 325.10 and fails to disclose or remit the levied funds as required in 325.11 this chapter. Upon order to show cause served on the third 325.12 party and notice of motion supported by affidavit of facts and 325.13 affidavit of service upon both the judgment debtor and third 325.14 party, the court may render judgment against the third party for 325.15 an amount not exceeding 100 percent of the amount claimed in the 325.16 execution. Judgment against the third party under this section 325.17 shall not bar the public authority from further remedies under 325.18 this chapter as a result of any subsequent defaults by the third 325.19 party. The court upon good cause shown may remove the default 325.20 and permit the third party to disclose or remit on just terms. 325.21 Subd. 9. [SATISFACTION.] Upon expiration, the public 325.22 authority making the execution may file a partial satisfaction 325.23 by amount or, if applicable, shall file the total satisfaction 325.24 with the court administrator without charge. 325.25 Subd. 10. [THIRD PARTY GOOD FAITH REQUIREMENT.] The third 325.26 party is not liable to the judgment debtor, public authority, or 325.27 other person for wrongful retention if the third party retains 325.28 or remits disposable earnings, indebtedness, or money of the 325.29 judgment debtor or any other person, pending the third party's 325.30 disclosure or consistent with the disclosure the third party 325.31 makes, if the third party has a good faith belief that the 325.32 property retained or remitted is subject to the execution. In 325.33 addition, the third party may, at any time before or after 325.34 disclosure, proceed under Rule 67 of the Minnesota rules of 325.35 civil procedure to make deposit into court. No third party is 325.36 liable for damages if the third party complies with the 326.1 provisions of this chapter. 326.2 Subd. 11. [BAD FAITH CLAIM.] If, in a proceeding brought 326.3 under section 552.05, subdivision 9, or a similar proceeding 326.4 under this chapter to determine a claim of exemption, the claim 326.5 of exemption is not upheld, and the court finds that it was 326.6 asserted in bad faith, the public authority shall be awarded 326.7 actual damages, costs, reasonable attorney's fees resulting from 326.8 the additional proceedings, and an amount not to exceed $100. 326.9 If the claim of exemption is upheld, and the court finds that 326.10 the public authority disregarded the claim of exemption in bad 326.11 faith, the judgment debtor shall be awarded actual damages, 326.12 costs, reasonable attorney's fees resulting from the additional 326.13 proceedings, and an amount not to exceed $100. The underlying 326.14 judgment shall be modified to reflect assessment of damages, 326.15 costs, and attorney's fees. However, if the party in whose 326.16 favor a penalty assessment is made is not actually indebted to 326.17 that party's attorney for fees, the attorney's fee award shall 326.18 be made directly to the attorney, and if not paid, an 326.19 appropriate judgment in favor of the attorney shall be entered. 326.20 Any action by a public authority made in bad faith and in 326.21 violation of this chapter renders the execution levy void and 326.22 the public authority liable to the judgment debtor named in the 326.23 execution levy in the amount of $100, actual damages, and 326.24 reasonable attorney's fees and costs. 326.25 Subd. 12. [DISCHARGE OF A THIRD PARTY.] Subject to 326.26 subdivisions 6 and 13, the third party, after disclosure, shall 326.27 be discharged of any further obligation to the public authority 326.28 when one of the following conditions is met: 326.29 (a) The third party discloses that the third party is not 326.30 indebted to the judgment debtor or does not possess any 326.31 earnings, property, money, or indebtedness belonging to the 326.32 judgment debtor that is attachable as defined in subdivision 2. 326.33 The disclosure is conclusive against the public authority and 326.34 discharges the third party from any further obligation to the 326.35 public authority other than to retain and remit all nonexempt 326.36 disposable earnings, property, indebtedness, or money of the 327.1 judgment debtor which was disclosed. 327.2 (b) The third party discloses that the third party is 327.3 indebted to the judgment debtor as indicated on the execution 327.4 disclosure form. The disclosure is conclusive against the 327.5 public authority and discharges the third party from any further 327.6 obligation to the public authority other than to retain and 327.7 remit all nonexempt disposable earnings, property, indebtedness, 327.8 or money of the judgment debtor that was disclosed. 327.9 (c) The court may, upon motion of an interested person, 327.10 discharge the third party as to any disposable earnings, money, 327.11 property, or indebtedness in excess of the amount that may be 327.12 required to satisfy the public authority's claim. 327.13 Subd. 13. [EXCEPTIONS TO DISCHARGE OF A THIRD PARTY.] The 327.14 third party is not discharged if: 327.15 (a) Within 20 days of the service of the third party's 327.16 disclosure, an interested person serves a motion relating to the 327.17 execution levy. The hearing on the motion must be scheduled to 327.18 be heard within 30 days of the service of the motion. 327.19 (b) The public authority moves the court for leave to file 327.20 a supplemental complaint against the third party, as provided 327.21 for in subdivision 7, and the court upon proper showing vacates 327.22 the discharge of the third party. 327.23 Subd. 14. [JOINDER AND INTERVENTION BY PERSONS IN 327.24 INTEREST.] If it appears that a person, who is not a party to 327.25 the action, has or claims an interest in any of the disposable 327.26 earnings, other indebtedness, or money, the court shall permit 327.27 that person to intervene or join in the execution proceeding 327.28 under this chapter. If that person does not appear, the court 327.29 may summon that person to appear or order the claim barred. The 327.30 person so appearing or summoned shall be joined as a party and 327.31 be bound by the judgment. 327.32 Subd. 15. [APPEAL.] A party to an execution proceeding 327.33 aggrieved by an order or final judgment may appeal as allowed by 327.34 law. 327.35 Subd. 16. [PRIORITY OF LEVY.] Notwithstanding section 327.36 52.12, a levy by the public authority made under this section on 328.1 an obligor's funds on deposit in a financial institution located 328.2 in this state has priority over any unexercised right of setoff 328.3 of the financial institution to apply the levied funds toward 328.4 the balance of an outstanding loan or loans owed by the obligor 328.5 to the financial institution. A claim by the financial 328.6 institution that it exercised its right to setoff prior to the 328.7 levy by the public authority must be substantiated by evidence 328.8 of the date of the setoff and must be verified by the sworn 328.9 statement of a responsible corporate officer of the financial 328.10 institution. For purposes of determining the priority of a levy 328.11 made under this section, the levy must be treated as if it were 328.12 an execution made under chapter 550. 328.13 Sec. 89. [552.05] [SUMMARY EXECUTION UPON FUNDS AT A 328.14 FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.] 328.15 Subdivision 1. [PROCEDURE.] In addition to the provisions 328.16 of section 552.04, when levying upon funds at a financial 328.17 institution, the public authority must comply with this 328.18 section. If the notice of support judgment levy is being used 328.19 by the public authority to levy funds of a judgment debtor who 328.20 is a natural person and if the funds to be levied are held on 328.21 deposit at any financial institution, in lieu of service the 328.22 public authority shall send with the notice of support judgment 328.23 levy and disclosure required by section 552.04, subdivision 4, 328.24 one copy of an exemption and right to hearing notice. The 328.25 notice must be substantially in the form determined by the 328.26 commissioner in accordance with section 552.05, subdivision 10. 328.27 Failure of the public authority to send the notice renders the 328.28 execution levy void, and the financial institution shall take no 328.29 action. Upon receipt of the notice of support judgment levy and 328.30 exemption and right to hearing notice, the financial institution 328.31 shall retain as much of the amount due as the financial 328.32 institution has on deposit owing to the judgment debtor, but not 328.33 more than 100 percent of the amount remaining due on the 328.34 judgment until directed by the public authority or the court to 328.35 release the funds to the public authority or the judgment debtor 328.36 in accordance with this chapter. 329.1 Subd. 2. [DUTIES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.] Within two 329.2 business days after receipt of the execution levy and exemption 329.3 and right to hearing notice, the financial institution shall 329.4 serve upon the judgment debtor the exemption and right to 329.5 hearing notice. The financial institution shall serve the 329.6 notice by first class mail to the last known address of the 329.7 judgment debtor. If no claim of exemption or request for 329.8 hearing is received by the public authority within 14 days after 329.9 the notice is mailed to the judgment debtor, the public 329.10 authority shall notify the financial institution within seven 329.11 days that the funds remain subject to the execution levy and 329.12 shall be remitted to the public authority. If a claim of 329.13 exemption or a request for hearing is received by the public 329.14 authority within 14 days after the exemption notice is mailed to 329.15 the judgment debtor, the public authority shall within seven 329.16 days notify the financial institution either to release the 329.17 funds to the judgment debtor or that the funds remain subject to 329.18 the execution levy pending the determination of an 329.19 administrative law judge at a requested contested case 329.20 proceeding. When notified by the public authority to release 329.21 the funds, the financial institution shall release the funds to 329.22 the public authority or to the judgment debtor, as directed by 329.23 the public authority, within two business days. 329.24 Subd. 3. [PROCESS TO CLAIM EXEMPTION.] If the judgment 329.25 debtor elects to claim an exemption, the judgment debtor shall 329.26 complete the applicable portion of the exemption and right to 329.27 hearing notice, sign it under penalty of perjury, and deliver 329.28 one copy to the public authority within 14 days of the date 329.29 postmarked on the correspondence mailed to the judgment debtor 329.30 containing the exemption and right to hearing notice. Failure 329.31 of the judgment debtor to deliver the executed exemption and 329.32 right to hearing notice does not constitute a waiver of any 329.33 claimed right to an exemption. Upon timely receipt of a claim 329.34 of exemption, funds not claimed to be exempt by the judgment 329.35 debtor remain subject to the execution levy. Within seven days 329.36 after the date postmarked on the envelope containing the 330.1 executed exemption and right to hearing notice mailed to the 330.2 public authority, or the date of personal delivery of the 330.3 executed exemption and right to hearing notice to the public 330.4 authority, the public authority shall either notify the 330.5 financial institution to release the exempt portion of the funds 330.6 to the judgment debtor or schedule a contested administrative 330.7 proceeding pursuant to subdivision 5. 330.8 Subd. 4. [PROCESS TO REQUEST HEARING.] If the judgment 330.9 debtor elects to request a hearing on any issue specified in 330.10 subdivision 6, the judgment debtor shall complete the applicable 330.11 portion of the exemption and right to hearing notice, sign it 330.12 under penalty of perjury, and deliver one copy to the public 330.13 authority within 14 days of the date postmarked on the 330.14 correspondence mailed to the judgment debtor containing the 330.15 exemption and right to hearing notice. Upon timely receipt of a 330.16 request for hearing, funds not claimed to be exempt by the 330.17 judgment debtor remain subject to the execution levy. Within 330.18 seven days after the date postmarked on the envelope containing 330.19 the executed request for hearing mailed to the public authority, 330.20 or the date of personal delivery of the executed request for 330.21 hearing to the public authority, the public authority shall 330.22 either notify the financial institution to release the exempt 330.23 portion of the funds to the judgment debtor or schedule a 330.24 contested administrative proceeding under section 518.5511 and 330.25 notify the judgment debtor of the time and place of the 330.26 scheduled hearing. 330.27 Subd. 5. [DUTIES OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY IF HEARING IS 330.28 REQUESTED.] Within seven days of the receipt of a request for 330.29 hearing or a claim of exemption to which the public authority 330.30 does not consent, the public authority shall schedule a 330.31 contested administrative proceeding under section 518.5511. The 330.32 hearing must be scheduled to occur within five business days. 330.33 The public authority shall send written notice of the hearing 330.34 date, time, and place to the judgment debtor by first class 330.35 mail. The hearing may be conducted by telephone, audiovisual 330.36 means or other electronic means, at the discretion of the 331.1 administrative law judge. If the hearing is to be conducted by 331.2 telephone, audiovisual means, or other electronic means, the 331.3 public authority shall provide reasonable assistance to the 331.4 judgment debtor to facilitate the submission of all necessary 331.5 documentary evidence to the administrative law judge, including 331.6 access to the public authority's facsimile transmission machine. 331.7 Subd. 6. [ISSUES RELEVANT AT HEARING.] At any hearing 331.8 requested by the judgment debtor under this chapter, the only 331.9 issues to be determined are whether: 331.10 (1) the public authority complied with the process required 331.11 by this chapter; 331.12 (2) the amount stated in the notice of support judgment 331.13 levy is owed by the judgment debtor; 331.14 (3) the amount stated in the notice of support judgment 331.15 levy is correct; or 331.16 (4) any of the funds levied upon are exempt. 331.17 Subd. 7. [NOTICE OF ORDER.] Within one business day of 331.18 receipt of the order of the administrative law judge, the public 331.19 authority shall send a copy of the order to the judgment debtor 331.20 at the judgment debtor's last known address and to the financial 331.21 institution. 331.22 Subd. 8. [RELEASE OF FUNDS.] At any time during the 331.23 procedure specified in this section, the judgment debtor or the 331.24 public authority may direct the financial institution to release 331.25 the funds in question to the other party. Upon receipt of a 331.26 release, the financial institution shall release the funds as 331.27 directed. 331.28 Subd. 9. [SUBSEQUENT PROCEEDINGS; BAD FAITH CLAIM.] If in 331.29 subsequent proceedings brought by the judgment debtor or the 331.30 public authority, the claim of exemption is not upheld, and the 331.31 office of administrative hearings finds that it was asserted in 331.32 bad faith, the public authority shall be awarded actual damages, 331.33 costs, and reasonable attorney fees resulting from the 331.34 additional proceedings, and an amount not to exceed $100. The 331.35 underlying judgment must be modified to reflect assessment of 331.36 damages, costs, and attorney fees. However, if the party in 332.1 whose favor a penalty assessment is made is not actually 332.2 indebted to the party's attorney for fees, the attorney's fee 332.3 award shall be made directly to the attorney and if not paid, an 332.4 appropriate judgment in favor of the attorney shall be entered. 332.5 Upon motion of any party in interest, on notice, the office of 332.6 administrative hearings shall determine the validity of any 332.7 claim of exemption, and may make any order necessary to protect 332.8 the rights of those interested. No financial institution is 332.9 liable for damages for complying with this section. The 332.10 financial institution may rely on the date of mailing or 332.11 delivery of a notice to it in computing any time periods in this 332.12 section. 332.13 Subd. 10. [FORMS.] The commissioner of human services 332.14 shall develop statutory forms for use as required under this 332.15 chapter.

[CAPITATION PAYMENT.] (a) The commissioner shall 366.33 pay a capitation payment to the county authority and, when 366.34 applicable under subdivision 6, paragraph (a), to the service 366.35 delivery organization for each medical assistance eligible 366.36 enrollee. The commissioner shall develop capitation payment 367.1 rates for the initial contract period for each demonstration 367.2 site in consultation with an independent actuary, to ensure that 367.3 the cost of services under the demonstration project does not 367.4 exceed the estimated cost for medical assistance services for 367.5 the covered population under the fee-for-service system for the 367.6 demonstration period. For each year of the demonstration 367.7 project, the capitation payment rate shall be based on 96 367.8 percent of the projected per person costs that would otherwise 367.9 have been paid under medical assistance fee-for-service during 367.10 each of those years. Rates shall be adjusted within the limits 367.11 of the available risk adjustment technology, as mandated by 367.12 section 62Q.03.

Any savings beyond those allowed for 367.17 the county authority, county administrative entity, or service 367.18 delivery organization shall be first used to meet the unmet 367.19 needs of eligible individuals. Payments to providers 367.20 participating in the project are exempt from the requirements of 367.21 sections 256.966 and 256B.03, subdivision 2. 367.22 (b) The commissioner shall monitor and evaluate annually 367.23 the effect of the discount on consumers, the county authority, 367.24 and providers of disability services. Findings shall be 367.25 reported and recommendations made, as appropriate, to ensure 367.26 that the discount effect does not adversely affect the ability 367.27 of the county administrative entity or providers of services to 367.28 provide appropriate services to eligible individuals, and does 367.29 not result in cost shifting of eligible individuals to the 367.30 county authority. 367.31 Subd. 11. [INTEGRATION OF FUNDING SOURCES.] The county 367.32 authority may integrate other local, state, and federal funding 367.33 sources with medical assistance funding. The commissioner's 367.34 approval is required for integration of state and federal funds 367.35 but not for local funds. During the demonstration project 367.36 period, county authorities must maintain the level of local 368.1 funds expended during the previous calendar year for populations 368.2 covered in the demonstration project. Excluding the state share 368.3 of Medicaid payments, state appropriations for state-operated 368.4 services shall not be integrated unless specifically approved by 368.5 the legislature. The commissioner may approve integration of 368.6 other state and federal funding if the intergovernmental 368.7 contract includes assurances that the people who would have been 368.8 served by these funds will receive comparable or better 368.9 services. The commissioner may withdraw approval for 368.10 integration of state and federal funds if the county authority 368.11 does not comply with these assurances. If the county authority 368.12 chooses to integrate funding, it must comply with the reporting 368.13 requirements of the commissioner, as specified in the 368.14 intergovernmental contract, to account for federal and state 368.15 Medicaid expenditures and expenditures of local funds.
