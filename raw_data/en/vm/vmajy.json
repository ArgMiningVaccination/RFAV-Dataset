Its main ingredient is guaranine, a naturally occurring substance similar to caffeine. It is known to increase mental alertness, fight fatigue, and increase stamina and physical endurance. It can also help increase memory. What is the difference between the caffeine in Awakening and the caffeine in energy drinks? The caffeine in Awakening is primarily naturally occurring caffeine that does not give you the shakes or jitters like processed, anhydrous caffeine, found in most energy drinks. Awakening contains a safe amount of guaranine, which has a similar structure to caffeine, but does not let you down like anhydrous caffeine and is arguably much safer. Why don't I \"crash\" after coming down off Awakening? Guarana is made of fatty seeds, which are not easily water-soluble, causing it to release slowly into the body. Because of this slow release, you don't feel a sudden caffeine high; nor do you feel a crash, like from caffeine found in coffee, tea and soft drinks.
