When you exercise, your body often feels more relaxed and calm, but there are mental benefits, too. Find out why exercise is beneficial, and which types of exercises are best to help balance your emotions. How Exercise Improves Mood When you engage in high-intensity exercise, your body and brain produce hormones, and neurotransmitters that have a positive impact on your mood, memory, energy levels, and sense of well-being. Some of these are known as endorphins, the body's feel-good chemicals. They can result in the \"runner's high\" that joggers talk about. After a good workout, your muscles are tired, but you feel more relaxed. You may also feel a sense of accomplishment, which boosts your self-confidence and improves your sense of well-being. Thanks to your workout, the pent-up tension and stress in your muscles and your mind are reduced. Exercise and Emotions While exercise is not, on its own, a treatment for clinical depression, studies show that even a single bout of exercise results in positive changes in brain chemicals and can improve your mood. A 2017 review on the effects of exercise published in the journal Brain Plasticity, found that after exercise, people reported a better mood with decreases in tension, depression, and anger. In fact, for people with mild or moderate depression, 30 minutes of intense exercise may be effective for improving mood. A review study that looked at 23 randomized controlled studies found combining exercise with conventional medication and cognitive behavioral therapy treatment for depression reduced depression symptoms even more. Most studies on exercise and mood show that 30 minutes of daily exercise is enough to reap the benefits. More exercise isn't necessarily going to make you happier, and as with anything, it's possible to overdo it. For example, one of the benefits of exercise is that it stimulates cortisol production, which can help with memory and alertness. On the other hand, too much cortisol can have negative effects on your body and for your mood. Types of Exercises to Improve Mood When it comes to exercise, it's crucial that you pick something you enjoy. Cardiovascular exercise is great, but if you hate swimming or running, you won't stick with it. And when an activity is more enjoyable, chances are better for long-term adherence. For your exercise routine, you might try a mix of solitary activities like walking, swimming, or gardening, combined with some group activities like high-intensity interval training classes or periodic group hikes or bike rides. In addition to the physical and endorphin benefits of exercise, another potential benefit of exercise is the opportunity for social interaction, which can often boost your mood just as much. The best type of exercise to improve your mood is often a mix of activities you enjoy and are motivated to stick with for the long term. For mood-lifting benefits, try any or all of the following activities. Some people get bored with the same exercise day after day; others relish the routine. Consider keeping the exercises you love as your anchor workouts, and then periodically swapping in other activities as your mood, schedule, or weather changes. For group classes, keep your eye open for seasonal discounts or Groupon offers. Cardiovascular and Aerobic Exercises Cardiovascular and aerobic exercises are great for creating the intensity required for the release of mood-raising endorphins in your body. Aerobic exercises are those that get your heart rate up, like jogging, swimming, cycling, brisk walking, or using an elliptical trainer. You can also get your heart rate up by doing activities like gardening and dancing\u2014both have been shown to reduce depression and anxiety. If you like sports, joining a local league to play soccer, basketball, or tennis can provide social interaction while giving you a cardiovascular workout. Joining a group class that provides a high-intensity interval workout like Crossfit or boxing is another way to get your cardio in while having some fun with friends. Yoga Yoga is a system of holistic health and spiritual growth which focuses on meditation, breathing exercises, and physical postures. Unless you're doing an active flow or vinyasa yoga class, yoga doesn't provide much of an aerobic workout. It can, however, teach you how to relax, release tension, stretch tight muscles, and even strengthen weak ones. Doing yoga regularly can help to ease anxiety and improve feelings of well-being. A 2016 review article on the use of yoga for anxiety and depression found that the practice is beneficial for reducing anxiety, depression, and symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Tai Chi A traditional Chinese exercise that is practiced worldwide, tai chi can benefit people who experience symptoms of anxiety and depression, and it has been shown to improve immune function as well as to increase the blood levels of feel-good endorphins. Anyone can do tai chi because the movements are easily learned and repetitive. It doesn't require strength or endurance but instead focuses on the form of the movements and breathing. Tai chi is considered a self-healing practice. According to traditional Chinese medicine, the practice helps to alleviate energy blockages in the body, which helps to prevent or treat certain diseases. Studies suggest that tai chi can improve many aspects of well-being including reducing depression, anxiety, stress. and mood disturbance as well as improving self-esteem. Conclusion There are so many benefits of exercise, which is why the Department of Health and Human Services recommends at least 150 minutes each week of moderate-intensity cardio exercise plus two days of strength training exercise for all adults.
