The case was presented at CROI earlier this year and [covered in detail on this blog at that time](https://tagbasicscienceproject.typepad.com/tags_basic_science_vaccin/2013/03/report-of-a-functional-cure-in-an-hiv-infected-infant.html). The paper is largely based on the previously presented data, but provides a brief update in the discussion section: the infant is now 36 months of age and remains in care, having now been off ART for at least 18 months without any return of HIV RNA (an additional 8 months of follow up from the prior report). The journal publication is accompanied by an editorial commentary from Scott Hammer. According to a [Nature News article published back in June](http://www.nature.com/news/bid-to-cure-hiv-ramps-up-1.13268), the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Group is now planning a trial to assess whether the apparent cure achieved in this case can be duplicated in other children born to mothers who did not receive ART to prevent mother-to-child-transmission.

ART was continued when detection of HIV-1 DNA and RNA on repeat testing met the standard diagnostic criteria for infection. After therapy was discontinued (when the child was 18 months of age), levels of plasma HIV-1 RNA, proviral DNA in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells, and HIV-1 antibodies, as assessed by means of clinical assays, remained undetectable in the child through 30 months of age. This case suggests that very early ART in infants may alter the establishment and long-term persistence of HIV-1 infection.
