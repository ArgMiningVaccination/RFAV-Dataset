Cuomo said that 10,000 vaccines had been administered Monday in New York. PEARL RIVER - Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla spent time Monday at the pharmaceutical giant's Rockland campus where key research on its promising COVID-19 vaccine took place. Meanwhile, a New York ICU nurse received the first dose of the vaccine with nary a flinch Monday morning. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that 10,000 vaccines had been administered Monday in New York. The positive developments Monday were juxtaposed with Monday's report that virus-related deaths in the U.S had topped 300,000. Meanwhile Hudson Valley area hospital officials anticipated arrival of the vaccine any day and officials at some local long-term care facilities including nursing homes reported that vaccinations could start there within weeks. COVID-19 vaccines are expected to be available for the general public in early 2021, said John Nelson, spokesperson for Nuvance Health, which operates Vassar Brothers Medical Center in Poughkeepsie. Vassar Brothers confirmed the facility has an ultra-cold storage unit needed for the Pfizer vaccine, but there was no available timetable for vaccine arrival or distribution. The timetable remains unclear, he said, but it could be by March or late spring. The state's vaccination priorities are generally: Healthcare workers in patient-care settings; long-term care workers and the most at-risk patients in facilities like nursing homes; first responders, teachers, and other frontline workers; people over 65 or those at high risk for severe COVID-19 illness due to underlying medical conditions; other essential workers; then healthy adults and children. \"We are not scheduling vaccine appointments at this time,\" Nelson said. Pfizer at center Pfizer teamed up with collaborator BioNTech to create their vaccine, BNT162b2, one of several in development to block the virus that causes COVID-19 and the first to win FDA clearance. The Pearl River campus houses the company's largest research and development team, with some 850-member staff of virologists, immunologists, biologists and clinical laboratory scientists at the campus off Middletown Road. The site has a long history in Rockland: Ernest Lederle founded his research lab in the hamlet in 1906, developing a vaccine to combat diphtheria that was then a major threat to children's lives. The complex has manufactured smallpox and polio vaccines, and housed scientists developing breakthrough cancer treatments. Along the way, the facility has changed hands among several pharmaceutical giants of their day. It was once the largest employer in the region. Pfizer continues to operate on just a portion of the sprawling campus that was once like a mini city in the Lederle Lab days. Boula on Monday told CNN that he would be among those getting a vaccine. \"People will believe much more in the vaccine if the CEO is getting vaccinated.\" NY goes first Cuomo watched on via a live feed as New York nurse Sandra Lindsay received the nation's first vaccine early Monday. \"I believe in science,\" said Lindsay, an ICU nurse at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in Queens in a statement from the governor's office. \"As a nurse, my practice is guided by science and so I trust that. What I don't trust is that, if I contract COVID, I don't know how it would impact or those who I come in contact with, so I encourage everyone to take the vaccine.\" Meanwhile, Hudson Valley area hospitals contacted provided updated timetables on vaccines arrivals. Montefiore Nyack Hospital reported that it anticipated the shots would arrive to their hospital as early Monday.

Matejicka II, vice president and Chief Medical Officer at Montefiore Nyack, the hospital's initial delivery of vaccine would be administered to hospital staff and hospital providers. Matejicka said the state health department is expected to assign Montefiore Nyack Hospital responsibility for vaccination administration of high-risk residents at community facilities in conjunction with future vaccine shipments. The New York-Presbyterian network, which includes Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville and NYP Hudson Valley Hospital in Cortlandt Manor, expects to begin vaccinating healthcare workers early this week. A White Plains Hospital spokesperson said vaccine doses had not arrived by mid-day Monday, but they were expected \"very soon.\" While the vaccine news captured the nation's attention, COVID-19 cases continued to spike in many regions. On Sunday, [New York reported 10,194 new coronavirus cases](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/politics/albany/2020/11/18/new-york-latest-covid-19-numbers-data/3762941001/) from the previous day, pushing the state's total past 770,000 confirmed cases since the start of March. Michael Balboni, executive director of greater New York Health Care Facilities Association, called health care workers \"ambassadors\"' because it would be through their vaccinations that the public may be eased into accepting the vaccinations as safe. \"Public acceptance is absolutely crucial,\" he said. Some 19,200 vaccines were expected to be delivered to the Mid-Hudson region in this initial shipment. Dutchess Assistant Commissioner of Community Health Cathi Tegtmeir said the initial shipment \"does not begin to cover health care workers and nursing homes, or assisted living adult care facilities, it doesn't begin to cover that.\" Get vaccine 'in a heartbeat' New York state opted into the federal government's nursing home vaccination program, which allows employees of CVS and Walgreens to vaccinate residents and staff at long-term care facilities, much like they do for the flu vaccine. Hudson Valley nursing homes and assisted care facilities could start administering the vaccine by Dec. 21, CVS spokesman Joe Goode said. According to [New York State's COVID-19 Vaccination Program](https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/NYS_COVID_Vaccination_Program_Book_10.16.20_FINAL.pdf) released in October, long-term care facilities such as nursing homes would be included in Phase I of vaccination distribution, after health-care workers in hospitals and other high-risk settings. Nursing facilities were asked to register with the federal government about a month ago to calculate how many vaccines would be needed, said Balboni, who is also spokesperson for the Sapphire Care Group. Fishkill Center For Rehabilitation and Nursing was told CVS pharmacists would come to inoculate residents and staff on Dec. 22, Balboni said. Balboni said he hoped the initial round of vaccines would be completed by Christmas. After each vaccine, the individual would be monitored for 15 minutes, much like a \"bee sting,\" to see if there are any adverse effects. The nursing homes won't need to bring on any additional medical staffing to help with the process. The individual would then be given the shot again, from the same distributor, after three weeks. The only residents not taking the vaccine would be those who have symptoms of COVID at the time and anyone who does not give consent. The facilities still have to figure out what to do with those residents or staff members who do not want to be vaccinated. Brenda Lynch of Clinton Corners is among the New Yorkers eager for that phase to begin. Lynch's 89-year-old mother resides at the Northern Dutchess Residential Health Care in Rhinebeck, also known as the Thompson House, for close to four years now. They haven't been able to visit since March. Lynch can see her mother through a window or on Zoom. But, she said, it's not the same as being in the same room. \"She was great (before March), now she's depressed. They're not allowed to leave their rooms,\" Lynch said, explaining that the restrictions were still in place because more staff had tested positive. \"I've had COVID,\" Lynch said. \"I would take the vaccine in a heartbeat and I'd allow my mother to have it too. If it means, that at 89 years old, if I have visitation in the last years of her life, you know, I'd pretty much do anything to see her again.\" Group homes could be in Phase I Jawonio CEO Randi Rios-Castro said on Monday that certain group homes for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities could be included in Phase I distribution of the vaccine. That would include some of the residences that Jawonio operates in Rockland County. \"They're looking to prioritize the group homes that have people who are 65 years of age or older,\" Rios-Castro said after discussions with the Cerebral Palsy Association of New York State. Those facilities would get the vaccine along with other long-term care facilities and nursing homes. The state Department of Health and Office for People with Developmental Disabilities would determine which facilities get the vaccines first, Rios-Castro said. These sites would likely receive the Moderna vaccine, which must be kept at freezing temperatures, but not in the extreme cold that Pfizer doses demand. The developmental disabilities community has been hit hard during the pandemic. By July, more than 425 group home residents with COVID-19 had died, according to OPWDD. Direct-care workers also were hit hard by the virus. Rios-Castro said many of Jawonio's residents have \"co-morbidities\" that put them at higher risk of a poor outcome from COVID-19. That includes significant health challenges, intellectual disabilities and age. \"Our oldest resident is 92.\" Check back later. This is a developing story.
