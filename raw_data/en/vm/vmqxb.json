Vaccines can protect many and vaccine injury is real. Its purpose, simply, is to outline the range of practical strategies Chinese Medicine offers if you or your child contracts measles. None of the suggestions outlined below should be considered a substitute for Western medical care. Recently, there's been a terrifying outbreak of measles. While some of the patients who have contracted it were not vaccinated, many were vaccinated and yet were not fully immune to the virus. Measles is highly contagious. It is so contagious that almost all susceptible people exposed to it will contract it. Because it is transmitted through the air (where it can linger for hours), you don't even need to touch a person with measles to contract it. Further, it's most contagious during the incubation period- before symptoms begin. For many, measles will be an uncomfortable, but not a life-threatening illness. At its onset, it resembles a bad cold or upper respiratory infection. Symptoms include body aches, fever, conjunctivitis, fatigue, and poor appetite. After 2-4 days an itchy rash, usually beginning on the head and them moving down the body. The rash is red at first, then becoming brownish and blanches upon pressure. There may be swollen glands. The rash subsides on its own after about a week. Measles runs its full course in about 10 days. Afterward, there will be fatigue. It's important at this time to allow time for convalescence. Fortunately for most people, they will then have life-long immunity to measles. How does Chinese Medicine help? Chinese medicine is at least 2000 years old. It endures because it works. It offers numerous practical tools for dealing with a wide range of chronic and acute conditions. Most people don't think to call their acupuncturist for management of acute infections, but when it comes to managing colds, flu and other infectious diseases, Chinese medicine is nearly peerless in the range of tools we have to manage these patients. Why? Because it had to. People have always gotten get sick and they need effective medicine. Students of Chinese medicine are taught that there are three main categories of disease: External; which refers to diseases that are caused by the environment and present in the myriad ways; Internal; which refers to imbalances caused by emotional stress and Neither internal nor external; this refers to poor diet and lifestyle choices and also includes the idea of epidemics (y\u00ec - ), meaning there is a pathogen that affects and presents in everyone exactly the same way. Therefore, Measles is categorized as an epidemic disease in Chinese medicine. The basis of Chinese Herbal medicine is the Han Dynasty text The Shang Han Lun-Treatise on Cold Damage which discusses, with enormous detail, the progression of catching a cold to chronic degenerative diseases [[i]](applewebdata://4F2768A3-611B-473F-B419-65C321637BC8#_edn1). Throughout history, these theories evolved and adapted, culminating in the Qing Dynasty Text: Wen Bing XueWarm Disease Theory, which was focused on the progression and treatment of epidemic diseases. These texts bookend several others that specifically focus on one disease: Dou Zhen Pox. Between the Song and Ming dynasties, I was able to identify six or seven texts [[i]](applewebdata://67688768-806F-458D-84E5-11D8FC2AADB9#_edn1)that discuss this topic. Further, management of measles is discussed throughout history. When I searched for terms with measles I found, among others- some of the in Chinese medicine theory, measles, mumps, or chicken pox are believed to be caused by fetal toxins, which are passed to the baby at conception or developed in the womb during gestation. TCM theorizes that these toxins are dormant until the child is challenged by an external pathogen. The toxins are then expressed to the surface of the body and present as a rash or blisters. In TCM, fully expressing these rashes is important to ensure full recovery and immunity. There are specific herbs and formulas to hasten the expression of rashes and measles. Based on this, when the rashes are fully expressed and cleared, and the child recovers fully, they will no longer have these fetal toxins within their system. Measles presents as a pattern of heat, so the herbs and formulas we use are generally cooling. Many have demonstrated clear antiviral properties. One of the most important formulas for measles is called Shng M\u00e1 G Gn TngCimicifuga and Pueraria Decoction. It's a classical Chinese formula used to vent rashes: It's indicated for the treatment of early-stage measles where the rash is not fully expressed. Other symptoms include headache, body aches, sneezing, coughing, red eyes, tearing and thirst. The idea of rashes is not limited to measles. The formula might also be used for chicken-pox, herpes zoster and herpes simplex. In my book TCM studies: Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat disorders, Shng M\u00e1 G Gn Tng was used Rh Glycyrrhizae Prep cum Melle But this isn't the only effective formula we have at our disposal. We have the ability to target and manage a wide range of presentations. Let's take a look at the symptoms: Fever and Sore Throat Fever is not an illness per se: it reflects a battle between a persons' immunity and a pathogen. For high fevers, we choose cooling and dispersing formulas. For the early stages (the first day) we might choose Yin Qiao SanLonicera and Forsythia Powder. In addition to the primary heat clearing herbs, the formula includes several herbs that are specific for the throat. I've italicized them below. Yin Qiao San treats early stage fevers, mild chills body aches and sore throat. Fl. Lonicera\u2014 Jin Yin Hua Fr. Forsythiae\u2014 Lian Qiao Hb. He Sp. Schizonepetae\u2014 Sui Sm Sojae Prep.\u2014 Dan Dou Chi Jie Geng Cao Hb. Lophatheri\u2014 Dan Zhu Ye Rz. Phragmitis\u2014 Lu Gen Pu Ji Xiao Du Yin Universal Salvation Toxin-Dispersing Beverage is a large heat clearing formula. When we see the word Toxin, it always indicates that the condition is severe. Here, the presentation is strong fever and chills, redness, swelling and burning pain of the face and head and thirst. It's commonly encountered in children. We might use this formula for parotitis, tonsillitis or severe conjunctivitis. RED EYES This symptom doesn't have to be treated separately, as it can be addressed with the formulas above. We do think that a cool compress of mint tea bags is a simple and safe strategy to help the eyes feel more comfortable. COUGH We use a range of formulas for coughs. A Chinese medicine practitioner will ask if the cough is wet or dry. What color the phlegm is and what the cough sounds like to treat it correctly. For a phlegmy cough, we might use the classical formula Qing Qi Hua Tan Tang Qi-Clearing Phlegm-Transforming Pill. For a dryer cough, we might use a moistening formula such as Sang Ju YinMulberry Chrysanthemum Beverage. In our practice, we also use several proprietary formulas that I have created. One of our favorites is Cough Cooler, which clears heat, transforms phlegm, and moistens the lungs and throat. We also think that convalescence is critical for full recovery. Western culture truly undervalues this part of recovery. But measles is a serious illness. We offer valuable tools for this stage too. We want to feel completely healed so you or your child can get back to work and school feeling healthy. Two strategies come to mind for managing this. In the first case, you may notice that after a fever, there can be restlessness. Kids might seem a little hyper. It might be hard to settle down. Chinese medicine says that sometimes, a small amount of heat from the fever is still lingering. We can use a tiny formula with only two herbs to help clear it. Zhi Zi Dou Chi Tang Gardenia and Fermented Soybean Decoction. I have found this simple and ancient formula to be incredibly effective. Finally, we can use a tonic formula. One favorite for many practitioners is Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang Center-Supplementing Qi-Boosting Decoction. Sometimes, after having been sick, we \"think\" we're recovered, but then we realize we actually don't feel well. At least not yet. Not only does this formula have an energizing and lifting up kind of energy, but a careful read of the original indications includes feeling mildly feverish that worsens with exertion. So, it's pretty perfect for the final stage of recovery. We hope that you and your family doesn't have to go through this, but know that Chinese Medicine has a cabinet filled with effective tools to get through every stage.
