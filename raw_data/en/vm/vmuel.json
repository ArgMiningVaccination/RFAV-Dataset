Schedule your appointment at Athena Chiropractic in Wilmington, DE, online or call us to make an appointment. We look forward to meeting you and to helping you live pain free. We use several different treatment modalities at Athena Chiropractic: Spinal Adjustments: Manual therapies are the hallmark of many chiropractors, including ours. These tried and true techniques are used to eliminate spinal misalignments that cause problems throughout the body. Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS): We apply TENS treatment to localized areas of pain. This treatment involves the use of electrodes placed against the skin, sending low-level electrical impulses to targeted areas. TENS helps soothe muscle and nerve pain. It also helps loosen and relax soft tissue prior to spinal adjustment. The Activator Method: This is another form of treatment our chiropractor uses. This pain-free treatment uses a small hand-held, spring-loaded device that applies pressure to targeted areas that may be the source of pain.
