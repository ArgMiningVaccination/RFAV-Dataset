The primary factors driving the market growth are increased awareness about healthcare, an increasing emphasis on preventive healthcare and personalized nutrition, and a trend towards self-directed care due to an increasing focus on personal health and well-being. Furthermore, many countries in the Asia Pacific region have aging populations, which has led to an increased demand for [dietary supplements](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/dietary-supplements-market) that can help manage age-related health issues such as joint pain, cognitive decline, and cardiovascular disease. The Asia Pacific region is home to a large and diverse population that is becoming increasingly health conscious. As a result, there has been a growing awareness about the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including good nutrition and physical activity. This trend has led to an increase in the demand for dietary supplements that can support overall health and well-being. The young population in the Asia Pacific region is especially focused on fitness and physical activity, and this has led to an increased demand for energy and weight management supplements. These supplements are designed to help individuals increase their energy levels and manage their weight, which can be particularly important for those who are engaged in rigorous physical activity or looking to lose weight. With the rise of [e-commerce](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/e-commerce-market) and online marketplaces, these products are becoming more accessible to consumers across the region. Traditional medicine has a long history in many parts of the Asia Pacific region, with practices such as traditional chinese medicine (TCM), Ayurveda, and Unani being widely used for centuries. These traditional medicine systems rely on natural remedies such as herbs, plants, and minerals to treat a wide range of health problems. As a result of this tradition, there is a high demand for dietary supplements made from traditional ingredients such as ginseng, turmeric, and ginger in the Asia Pacific region. These ingredients have been used for centuries in traditional medicine to promote health and treat various ailments. The popularity of these traditional ingredients has led to an increased demand for dietary supplements containing them in the Asia Pacific region. Many manufacturers of dietary supplements in the region now offer products containing traditional ingredients, often in combination with other vitamins, minerals, and [natural extracts](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/natural-extracts-market). The Asia-Pacific region has seen several new product launches from nutrition companies, including Junlebao's lactoferrin infant formula, DSM's \"faster-acting\" vitamin D from Singapore, and various new launches from other key players. In August 2022, Junlebao, a Chinese dairy company, launched a lactoferrin infant formula. Lactoferrin is a protein found in breast milk that supports the immune system and promotes healthy gut bacteria. The new formula is designed to provide infants with similar benefits to those of breast milk. Similarly, in March 2021, DSM launched a \"faster-acting\" vitamin D supplement called ampli-D in Australia. The supplement is designed to enhance calcium absorption and support bone health. These launches indicate the growing demand for specialized nutrition products in the region, as consumers become increasingly interested in products that target specific health concerns and provide unique benefits. Vitamins held a dominant position in the Asia Pacific market in 2022 accounting for a share of 30.4%. This is primarily attributed to various factors such as the introduction of new multivitamin supplements, increasing consumer interest in overall wellness, and growing awareness of lifestyle disorders. In March 2021, DSM introduced a new type of vitamin D called ampli-D in the Asia Pacific region, which is designed to work quickly and efficiently in dietary supplements. Proteins & amino acids are expected to record the fastest growth during the forecast period, at a CAGR of 17.2%. This is primarily attributed to the rising demand for protein supplements such as whey powders, and amino acid products like creatine, citrulline, tyrosine, and proline, as consumers are becoming more health conscious. Tablets dominated the market with a revenue share of 33.6% in 2022. This can be attributed to the higher prevalence of multivitamin products in tablet form, which are easy to dose, have a low cost, longer shelf life, and provide greater convenience to consumers. [Gummies](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/gummy-market-report) are projected to grow at a CAGR of 15.2% during the forecast period. Over the recent past, manufacturers have focused on launching gummy supplements owing to their increasing preference among consumers. In June 2022, First Day, a U.S.-based brand that offers gummy vitamins for all age groups, entered the Chinese market through its launch on significant Chinese eCommerce platforms. The liquid form is expected to grow at a CAGR of 16.7% over the forecast period. The growth is attributed to the fact that liquid supplements can evenly disperse in water, making them easier to consume. Additionally, the liquid form of supplements facilitates easy blending, leading to higher usage in yogurt, smoothies, and other [energy drinks](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/energy-drinks-market). These factors are expected to drive the growth of the liquid form of dietary supplements in the Asia Pacific market. The energy and weight management segment emerged as the dominant application segment in the market in 2022, accounting for a revenue share of 30.6%. This is attributed to the increasing focus on physical wellness and fitness among consumers in the region. Rising obesity concerns in Asia Pacific are expected to fuel the demand for weight management dietary supplements. Consumers are shifting from traditional diet products, which offer short-term benefits, to [weight management](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/weight-management-market) products that provide long-term satiety and appetite control. This trend is expected to widen the growth opportunities for the market, with the growing penetration of supplements in households for weight monitoring and management. The Asia Pacific dietary supplements industry is expected to witness significant growth in the fibers and specialty carbohydrates segment due to increasing awareness regarding gut health. The rising prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, acid reflux, and indigestion is expected to drive the demand for dietary supplements that promote gut health. Furthermore, the revenue from immunity applications is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.5% over the forecast period. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has led to a surge in demand for immunity-boosting products throughout the Asia Pacific. This has resulted in increased demand for vitamins, minerals, and botanical supplements that can boost immunity, a trend that is expected to continue driving market growth until 2030. Adults dominated the market with a revenue share of 46.4% in 2022 the increasing awareness of the significance of maintaining a balanced diet among working professionals and athletes. Modern lifestyles and busy work schedules make it difficult for adults to obtain all the necessary nutrients through their regular diet. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for dietary supplements to bridge the gap between the nutrients required and those obtained from regular meals. By providing the essential vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that may be lacking in a regular diet, these supplements can help individuals to maintain their overall health and well-being. Furthermore, in the Asia Pacific region, the high incidence of conditions such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes among adults is likely to be a significant driving factor for the growth of the dietary supplement industry. Additionally, the growing acceptance of sports as a professional career among adults is expected to contribute to the demand for dietary supplements such as protein, vitamins, and [amino acids](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/amino-acids-market). As athletes and fitness enthusiasts seek to enhance their performance and recovery, they are likely to turn to dietary supplements for support. The market for geriatric end-user is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.7% during the forecast period. This growth is largely attributed to the rising number of geriatric population in Asia Pacific countries, which is expected to drive the demand for dietary supplements. As the geriatric population is particularly susceptible to infections, there has been a surge in demand for immunity boosters among these end-users, especially in the post-pandemic era. This trend is expected to continue driving market growth in the geriatric consumer segment. OTC (Over-the-Counter) dietary supplements dominated the market with a revenue share of 76.0% in 2022. The consumer trend of self-directed health care is likely to drive the demand for OTC supplements. OTC supplements are often less expensive than prescription supplements, which can make them an affordable option for consumers. Furthermore, the growth of e-commerce and online retailers has made it easier for consumers to purchase dietary supplements online, contributing to the growth of the OTC segment. Online retailers often offer a wider selection of products and competitive prices, making it easier for consumers to find the dietary supplements they need. The prescribed dietary supplements segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.9% over the forecast period. These supplements are manufactured to meet high standards that are similar to pharmaceutical drugs. They come with minimal side effects and are properly labeled. Due to strict regulations imposed by governing bodies and a lack of awareness among individuals about health claims and labeling, sales of prescription-based dietary supplements are expected to rise in the Asia Pacific region. Moreover, individuals with nutritional deficiencies who require precise delivery of nutrients are increasingly using prescribed dietary supplements. The offline distribution channel is projected to dominate the market with a revenue share of 82.5% in 2022. Supermarkets and hypermarkets are the leading contributors to sales in the offline channel due to their widespread presence and popularity among consumers in the region. These traditional brick-and-mortar stores offer a wide variety of dietary supplements from different manufacturers and brands, making it easier for consumers to find and purchase the products they need. Moreover, these stores provide an opportunity for consumers to physically inspect and compare different products, which is important when buying health supplements. The online distribution channel for dietary supplements in Asia Pacific is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.6% during the forecast period. The increasing popularity of online shopping in the region, coupled with the convenience and accessibility it offers, is expected to drive the growth of the online distribution channel for the dietary supplements industry in the Asia Pacific region. The 24/7 availability of products and the ability to compare prices and products across different online retailers contributes to the growth of the online distribution channel for dietary supplements in Asia Pacific. China dominated the market for dietary supplements and accounted for the largest revenue share of 39.93% in 2022 owing to the growing consumer base and growing trend towards preventive healthcare. The growth of the market in the country can be attributed to increasing expenditure on health-enhancing products in the region owing to growing per capita income. China is a significant market for dietary supplements, and the country's increasing middle class and aging population present a great opportunity for global market players to expand in China. In January 2023, Vitabiotics, a company based in the UK, extended its presence in the lucrative dietary supplement industry in China by leveraging Alibaba Group's Tmall online platform. Australia & New Zealand dietary supplements industry is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 14.2% over the forecast period owing to the increasing health consciousness and rising demand for dietary supplements. Furthermore, global market players are expanding their business in Australia to meet the increasing demand for dietary supplements.

This acquisition is aimed at tapping into the rapidly growing market for effervescent vitamins in Australia.
