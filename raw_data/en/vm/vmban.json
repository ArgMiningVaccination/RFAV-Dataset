My comments here are based on available scientific data and, where indicated, on my clinical experience with the latest surge. Here are a few key points we can safely say we know about the Omicron variant: It is Highly Transmissible: Omicron is so highly contagious that no level of vaccination or prior infection will fully prevent transmission. The vaccines and prior bouts of COVID do help people resist serious illness, but their effect begins to wane after 3 months. Vaccine booster shots, despite the very high antibody levels they produce, begin losing their effectiveness after 10 weeks. The peak of infectivity, as measured by the amount of live virus in nasal swabs, occurs between 3-6 days after the onset of symptoms or the first positive test. The Omicron variant spreads readily outdoors. It does not require prolonged interpersonal contact, and is less impacted by the wearing of face masks or physical distancing than previous variants. Respiratory droplets can travel as far as 27 feet, and may stay airborne for as long as 15 minutes in still air. The CDC now recommends N95 and KN95 masks as masks of choice. Cloth masks alone are not likely to be effective. A study from Japan, not yet published, gives evidence\u2014not just opinion\u2014about the infectivity of the Omicron variant. The data show this: the peak of infectivity, as measured by the amount of live virus in nasal swabs, occurs between 3-6 days after the onset of symptoms or the first positive test. Infectivity probably starts before symptoms, as has been true for other variants. Live viruses persist for 10 days after symptom onset or first positive swab, and then rapidly fall off. The CDC's recent guidelines recommending just 5 days of quarantine are misguided and not based on this new evidence. Please note this in making personal and family decisions. Omicron May Manifest Differently Than Older Variants: Sore throat and stuffed nose are the usual symptoms of infection with Omicron in people who have some degree of COVID immunity. People lacking COVID immunity tend to be much sicker. At this time, if you think you have a cold, there is a 50% chance you have COVID-19. Get tested. Rapid antigen tests may yield false negatives, so if you have symptoms, get a PCR test, and repeat it in 48 hours if the test is negative but symptoms persist. If you test positive, notify anyone and everyone with whom you've been in contact. The exposure is likely to have occurred 4-5 days before the onset of symptoms, and you probably became infectious to others within 48-72 hours after exposure. Omicron May Not be as \"Mild\" as it Seems: The reported decrease in severity of Omicron compared to previous variants may be due to two factors: (a) Most people in the US already have some degree of protective immunity (from prior infection, vaccines, or both), (b) Omicron grows more readily in the upper respiratory passages and less readily in the lungs, when compared to previous variants. This growth pattern decreases the likelihood of severe pneumonia. But it may not decrease the likelihood of neurological problems, including the so-called \"Long COVID\" with its associated cognitive dysfunction. The virus can enter the brain directly from the nose. At this time, if you think you have a cold, there is a 50% chance you have COVID-19. Get tested. Anti-Viral Nasal Sprays Appear to Be Somewhat Protective: Heparin-based products do work to prevent viral attachment, but they need to be used regularly and frequently (about every 4 hours) in situations where exposure might occur. This includes living with someone else who is not as careful as you are. I recommend heparin as a nasal spray taken before and after any type of brief encounter with other people, and every 4 hours during longer encounters. The nasal mucosa is the main portal of entry for the virus into your body. The mucosal cells contain the highest co-concentration of the factors needed for SARS-CoV-2 to enter. The nose acts like an incubator in which the virus multiplies and from which it is inhaled into the lungs. Preventing or limiting viral entry into the nose has the potential to prevent or reduce systemic disease In July 2020 I designed a nasal spray containing low-dose heparin which is produced by compounding pharmacies. The concentration in this spray is 100 units per spray, which should be more than enough to saturate the virus, even when diluted by nasal secretions. At the low dose used, heparin does not kill the virus; but it prevents viral attachment to the lining of the nose. It is safe, simple, and stable. (Read Preventing COVID With Nasal Sprays). Monoclonal Antibodies Do Not Work Well for Omicron: Sotrovimab, the only monoclonal with demonstrated effects against Omicron, is limited in its availability. Pfizer's new anti-viral drug, Paxlovid, which was 89% effective at preventing hospitalization, also has very limited distribution. Paxlovid has a short lifespan in the body, so it is administered with another antiviral called Ritonavir, which interacts with many commonly-prescribed drugs. This makes it unsuitable for many people. Paxlovid works by inhibiting a coronavirus enzyme called 3CL-protease or the main protease. As I discuss in my free online Coronavirus Guidebook, there are many natural products that inhibit 3CL-protease. Among these are the flavonoid quercetin, and the herbs Andrographis paniculata and Houttuynia cordata. Specific protocols are available from my office and have been updated for 2022. Leo Galland, MD, is an internist in New York City, specializes in the evaluation and treatment of patients of all ages with complex chronic disorders. He is internationally recognized for developing innovative nutritional therapies to treat autoimmune, inflammatory, allergic, infectious and gastrointestinal disorders and has described his work in numerous scientific articles and textbook chapters. In my search for strategies that can limit Covid-19, I've discovered a potential role for non-toxic anti-viral nasal sprays. You may want to consider them for yourself and your patients, in situations in which you or they are potentially exposed to the virus, including work, travel, school or social encounters. The mucosal lining of the nose is the main portal of entry for SARS-CoV-2. Mucosal cells contain the highest concentration of the factors needed for the virus to enter. The nose thus acts like an incubator in which the virus multiplies, and from which it is inhaled into the lungs (Hou YJ, et al. Cell, 2020) or directly enters the brain. A laboratory study of hamsters found that the Omicron variant achieves the same concentration in the nose as does the delta variant, even though the levels in lungs are much lower (Diamond M, et al. Research Square, 2021). Therefore, it makes sense that preventing or limiting viral entry into the nose has the potential to prevent or reduce infiltration of the lungs and thus systemic disease. There's some evidence that intranasal sprays can help. The mucosal lining of the nose is the main portal of entry for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it makes sense that preventing or limiting viral entry into the nose has the potential to prevent or reduce infiltration of the lungs and thus systemic disease. As proof of concept, early research on ferrets indicated that a spray containing a lipopeptide that mimics amino acids on the viral spike protein, could effectively block nasal entry and prevent viral transmission. Israeli researchers later showed that Taffix, an intranasal powder containing hypromellose and citric acid, gave a four-fold reduction in person-to-person transmission among congregants for Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year) religious services, which were considered to be super-spreader events (Klang S, et al. Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther. 2021). Currently, there are 15 different nasal sprays under development around the world, that employ various compounds, among them hypromellose, carragelose, nitric oxide, and heparin, all of which can block viral entry via different mechanisms. Unfortunately, none of them are widely available in the US. Intranasal Heparin A more accessible option is intranasal heparin. This is extremely promising as a modality for preventing entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the nasopharynx and lungs. Though there are no ready-made commercial products yet on the market, it is something one can order from compounding pharmacies. Most commonly prescribed as an anticoagulant, heparin is a derivative of a natural substance called heparan sulfate, which is part of a cellular coating called the glycocalyx, found on the membranes of cells throughout the body. Heparan plays a key role in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells, a multistep process in which the viral spike proteins attach to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, embedded in the membranes of respiratory mucosal cells. Heparan on the cell membrane holds the viral spike protein in place, enabling its attachment to ACE-2 (Partridge LJ, et al. BioRxiv. 2020). Blocking Viral Entry Without this initial linkage to heparan, the virus is not able to find the ACE2 molecules. (Martino C, et al. BioRxiv. 2020). That's where heparin comes in handy. Free heparin, administered as a medication, can act as a decoy, attaching to the viral spike protein and rendering it unable to attach to heparan (Clausan TM, et al. Cell. 2020). This decoy binding is very tight, irreversible, and occurs at extremely low concentrations of heparin (Kim SY, et al. Antiviral Res. 2020). Injected heparin is widely used to treat or prevent blood clots in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Inhaled heparin, given at high doses by nebulizer, has been used to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The purpose of inhaled heparin is to prevent widespread clotting in the small blood vessels of the lungs, but it has no significant effect on systemic coagulation, even at high doses (Van Haren FMP, et al. Crit Care. 2020) At the low dose in this nasal spray, heparin does not kill the virus; but it prevents viral attachment to the lining of the nose. It is safe, simple, and stable. The goal of nasal heparin is simply to prevent attachment of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to ACE-2, thus neutralizing the virus. The dose needed for this effect is much lower than that needed to prevent blood clots. This is easy to attain without risk of systemic anticoagulant effects. Low Dose, Low Risk In July 2020 I designed a nasal spray containing low dose heparin dissolved in salt water. I have it made by compounding pharmacies. The heparin concentration in this spray is 10 units/ml, which should be more than enough to saturate the virus, even when diluted by nasal secretions. The entire spray bottle contains only 300 units of heparin. Because of the heightened transmissibility of the Omicron variant, and after reviewing safety data published by researchers at the University of Mississippi, I recently recommended an increase in concentration to 1000 units/ml. By comparison, clinicians treating hospitalized COVID patients with inhaled heparin are giving 25,000 units each time. At the dose used in this nasal spray, heparin does not kill the virus; but it prevents viral attachment to the lining of the nose. It is safe, simple, and stable. This formula is intended for use as needed for potential exposure, but it is safe enough to be taken daily for extended periods of time. It should be sprayed into each nostril soon before and soon after a potential exposure to COVID, and may be repeated 4 hours after the exposure. It can be used daily, every 4 hours, if you have continuous or repeated exposures. The solution has a shelf life at room temperature of about a year, but is cleared by the pharmacies for shorter periods of time, to insure sterility. Free heparin, administered as a medication, can act as a decoy, attaching to the viral spike protein rendering them unable to attach to the heparan on the cell membranes. Currently, two pharmacies are compounding the formula I developed: The Healthy Choice pharmacy uses a preservative to extend storage safety; CareFirst's formulation is preservative-free. Each bottle contains 300 sprays. I have no financial interest in these sprays. They are only available with a doctor's prescription. Note that commercially available heparin is derived from pork intestine, so people who are allergic to or otherwise averse to pork should not use these sprays. Pseudo-allergic reactions to heparin may also occur. Similarly, those who are prone to nosebleeds should not use intranasal heparin, and it should be discontinued one day before any dental surgery or Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) procedure. Because it has to cover only a small surface area, intranasal heparin spray provides a very low systemic dose, but a relatively high concentration in the nose. Generally, this is quite safe, though there may be a local anticoagulant effect, limited to the inside of your nose and perhaps your mouth. Anyone experiencing swelling or difficulty breathing after using this spray should discontinue immediately. A research team in Australia is starting a clinical trial of a heparin nasal spray for prevention of COVID-19. In the words of these investigators, heparin \"can rapidly wrap around the virus's spike protein like a python, preventing it from infecting you or spreading the virus to others.\" They are testing a dose much higher than the one in the spray I designed, and have not seen adverse effects. Because of the high transmissibility of the Omicron variant, I have asked the two pharmacies making my formula to increase the concentration in the sprays. Note that I have no financial interest in these intranasal heparin sprays. Researchers at the University of Mississippi and Rensselaer Polytechnic institute also hope to create a commercial prescription spray based on heparin. But you do not need to wait for their spray to be approved; compounding pharmacies can make them for you and your patients. Other Options As mentioned at the beginning of this article, there are several anti-viral nasal sprays now commercially available in other countries. They include: Carragelose (Marinomed Biotech, Vienna): Carragelose is a trademarked form of iota-carrageenan, derived from red marine algae. It produces a non-specific coating of the nasal lining, and may have some general anti-viral activity. In clinical trials, Carragelose shortened the duration of upper respiratory infection (Ludwig M, et al. Respiratory Research. 2013), but there are not yet any studies to establish its preventive benefits or the safety of continuous preventive use. There is evidence from a study of human lung cell cultures that the substance has antiviral activity against the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 (Froba M, et al. Int J Mol Sci. 2021). This follows several earlier in vitro studies suggesting antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. But the effect has not yet been confirmed in actual human clinical studies. That said, an Argentine study of a generic iota-carrageenan product combined with the drug ivermectin as a mouthwash did show significant benefits in preventing COVID-19 among health care workers. Carragelose nasal sprays, throat sprays, and lozenges are commercially available in 29 countries for treatment of common respiratory viral infections. It is not readily available in the US. Marinomed Biotech says human trials looking at Carragelose for COVID-19 prevention are underway in the UK and Austria. Taffix (Nasus Pharma, Tel Aviv): As noted earlier, Taffix is a nasal powder containing hypromellose and citric acid, commercially available in Israel, the UK, and Europe. Taffix creates a diffuse coating of the nasal lining. It's acidic pH of 3.5 is allegedly anti-viral, though SARS-CoV-2 is stable at pH as low as 3.0. In a non-randomized clinical trial, Taffix users had a 78% reduction in incidence of COVID-19 compared to non-users following prolonged communal prayer. VirX / Enovid (SaNOtize): These are nitric oxide nasal sprays developed by a Canadian research and development company called SaNOtize.VirX and Enovid are identical; the names vary depending on the countries in which they're sold. Intranasal NO has been shown to completely eradicate SARS-CoV-2 in the nose after 24 hours of administration. SaNOtize describes this product as \"like a hand sanitizer for the nose, creating a physical barrier in the nasal passages that stops viruses.\" It should be used every 4 hours for a minimum of 24 hours after a known exposure. The company is promoting it as a potential early stage treatment for COVID-19, and it was the subject of an 80-patient, UK-based clinical trial that showed marked reduction in viral load, but did not look at clinical endpoints (Winchester S, et al. J Infect. 2021) It could be helpful for people within one to five days of having been exposed to someone known to have COVID-19. Though not widely available in the US, Enovid can be purchased via IsraelPharm, an online pharmacy that delivers worldwide within 7-10 days.

With an ambitious mandate to study botanical medicine \"at the cellular, molecular, and cultural level to create novel botanical solutions that support people, plants, and planet,\" the Ric Scalzo Institute for Botanical Research at Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine aims to refine our understanding of herbs. The new Institute is equipped with state-of-the-art analytical equipment, and staffed by experts from diverse disciplines who, working together, will increase scientific rigor in the study of herbs while honoring the traditional knowledge at the base of modern herbal medicine. It's a place where cutting edge phytochemical analysis is guided by deep ethnobotanical wisdom. \"The herbal industry is often criticized for the lack of evidence in botanical medicine,\" says Bill Chioffi, VP of Strategic Partnerships & Business Development at the Institute, reflecting on mainstream medicine's reflexive dismissal of herbs. \"That's why elevating the research and engaging future naturopaths, medical doctors, and natural products companies is so important.\" Funded by an unrestricted grant from Ric Scalzo, founder of the popular brand, Gaia Herbs, the Institute's 4,385 square foot lab facility features a complete phytochemical characterization lab featuring liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology for identification and quantification, as well as preparatory high-performance liquid chromatography, and low, medium, and high-pressure chromatographic separation instruments. The Institute also has a molecular biology lab equipped with a darkroom for immunoflouorescent spectrometry, and a full suite of analytical technology for bioassays, including real time PCR, Elisa, Western Blot, and transcriptome profiling. The Institute is licensed as a Biosafety Level 2 lab (BSL-2) for its viral culture lab, in which researchers can test the effects of various herbs against a host of human pathogens including MRSA, Borrelia, Influenza, Coronaviruses, Herpes, HIV, and others. Jeffrey Langland, PhD, Director of Research at the center, is a molecular biologist/virologist, with decades of experience in both academia and pharmaceutical development. Consequently, molecular biology and pre-clinical basic research figure strongly into the new institute's agenda. Langland and his core team, which includes six PhDs, three ND-herbalists, and a pharmacist are working to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms by which phytochemicals exert their effects on human or microbial physiology. Why do certain botanical compounds disrupt viral replication or kill certain bacteria? How do cannabinoids modulate pain? What drives the adverse effects seen with some herbs? How do phytochemicals affect human metabolism? In answering questions like these, they hope to provide quantitative validation of traditional botanical medicine, Ayurveda, Chinese medicine, and modern naturopathy, while at the same time nurturing development of new and truly evidence-based herbal combinations. \"The herbal industry is often criticized for the lack of evidence in botanical medicine. That's why elevating the research is so important.\" Bill Chioffi, VP of Strategic Partnerships & Business Development, Ric Scalzo institute for Botanical Research The Scalzo Institute is part of the research department at SCNM. The college's clinical faculty provides guidance, and the institute offers opportunities for SCNM students to participate in research projects. Simultaneously, the school's on-site clinics will be sites for human pilot studies that can lay the groundwork for larger clinical studies. Scalzo Institute researchers have undertaken projects across a wide range of clinical themes, including: Phytochemical composition of commonly used medicinal herbs Impact of herbs on viral infections, including influenza, rhinovirus, herpes, papillomavirus, and coronavirus How herbs affect bacterial pathogens, as well as the normal microbiome Botanical interactions with the human immune system Elucidation of mechanisms of action for herbs that relieve pain, anxiety, and stress Validation of the in vitro activity of specific Cannabis chemovars Beneficial and Harmful Herb-Drug Interactions The goal, Chioffi says, is to focus on topics relevant to human, and in some cases, animal health. Among the team's main objectives is to publish in prominent peer-reviewed journals, to present research at scientific conferences, and to educate scientists, practitioners, and the general public. Beyond academia, there's also a vision for translating basic research into useful products through partnerships with natural products companies. Chioffi says the Institute is developing multi-year research contracts with leading botanical supplement makers with the goal of developing evidence-based, patentable, and when appropriate, IP-protected ingredients and formulations. With its emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration, and its \"petri dish to patient care\" scope, the Scalzo Institute shares common features with the Nutrition Innovation Center established by Standard Process in Kannapolis, NC, several years ago. Hot Projects In its first year of operation, the Institute has already launched a number of projects many of which have led to clinically significant findings. Bioactive Constituents in Echinacea & Potential Interactions with Pharmaceutical Ingredients: Plants in the genus Echinacea produce compounds that induce or inhibit cytochrome enzymes, P-glycoprotein, organic ions, and other transporter molecules. At the Institute, Susan Trapp, PhD & Narges Kiyani PhD, have been assessing how Echinacea-derived phytochemicals affect metabolism of commonly used drugs For example, some Echinacea extracts can inhibit cytochrome P2A1, which will increase blood concentrations of caffeine when the herb is taken concomitantly with caffeine-containing beverages. Cyclosporine, which has a narrow therapeutic window, is metabolized by several enzymes affected by Echinacea-derived compounds; therefore, it is best to avoid using Echinacea when taking this drug. But other drugs, like prednisone and azithromycin are not affected by this herb. To some extent the effect of Echinacea on drug metabolism depends on which part of the plant is used for the extract; roots seem to produce more compounds that affect cytochromes and transporter proteins than aerial parts. Combatting Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria with Propolis: Researchers Daniel Clark & Melissa Bellman have been studying the antimicrobial properties of propolis, the sticky resinous substance bees produce to maintain the structural integrity of their hives. Propolis also keeps hives pathogen-free, and it has long been promoted for human immune system support. Though propolis is not a botanical in the strict sense, its biochemical composition derives largely from the plants on which the bees feed. Phytochemical constituents can vary widely from region to region. The SCNM researchers tested 100% ethanol extractions of propolis from several US states, as well as from Canada, Russia, Brazil, Lithuania, Greece, Ukraine, and Bulgaria against three troublesome bugs: methicillin resistant Staphylococcus dose level, propolis resulted in a one million-fold reduction in colonies of MRSA. With drug-resistent Klebsiella, a 30-microliter dose of propolis resulted in a 10 million-fold bacterial reduction, the SCNM team reports. The Pseudomonas strain, which was resistant to ampicillin, cephalosporin, nitrofurantonin, and other drugs, was tougher. But it was still susceptible to the propolis extract. At a 30-microliter dose, there was a 1,000-fold drop in bacterial colonies. That might seem modest compared to the near eradication of MRSA and Klebsiella, but it is more or less the same level of antimicrobial activity as advertised for common hand sanitizer products. The propolis extracts had similar activity against antibiotic-sensitive strains of the same pathogens. Though this work is still very pre-clinical, it does have important implications given that 2.8 million people are affected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria every year, and roughly 35,000 die from them. Botanical Synergies for SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Dr. Langland, who had considerable vaccine development experience prior to entering botanical research, heads a large project to screen herbs with potential antiviral properties, especially those that might be useful in combatting SARS-CoV-2. Drawing largely from the Asian medical literature on use of herbs to treat the virus responsible for the 2004 SARS epidemic, he and his team compiled a list of 40 potential candidates that might be able to either directly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 or improve immune defenses. It included widely known herbs like Angelica, Artemisia, Camellia, Ginger, Cinnamon, as well as other less common ones. Since the SCNM lab is not cleared to handle highly pathogenic viruses like SARS-CoV-2, Langland and colleagues collaborated with Arizona State University, which has a BSL-3 level lab. For each of the plants in question, the researchers first tested 20% to 70% ethanol extracts in cell toxicity assays, to look at effects on healthy human cell cultures. This determines basic safety: if exposure to high doses of an herb has little effect on healthy cell cultures one can presume the herb is not cytotoxic to normal cells. This was followed by viral plaque assays in which they apply the herbal extracts to cultures infected with SARS-CoV-2, to determine if the herbs can mitigate viral replication and spread. \"What we want to see is little (cyto)toxicity at high doses, but very low doses required for inhibition of virus replication,\" Langland said. This Selectivity Index\u2014a simple division of the cytotoxic dose by the viral inhibitory dose\u2014\"is really the best measure we have to evaluate a drug or botanical extract for in vitro antimicrobial effects.\" \"Our goal is to use botanicals to target different steps in the replication process, to create a truly synergistic blend for inhibiting replication of these viruses.\" -Jeffrey Langland, PhD, Director of Research, Ric Scalzo Institute for Botanical Research Most of the herbs on the original list turned out not to be effective antivirals. But five stood Salvia miltiorriza (Red sage). All were highly effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2, with little cellular toxicity in normal cells. Some had broad spectrum activity against other coronavirus types as well. Based on previously published work, the SCNM researchers identified proposed target sites and mechanisms by which these five herbs most likely exert their effects. Camellia, and Salvia appear to interfere with viral attachment to host cells. Chrysanthemum, Scutellaria, and Houttuynia inhibit viral transcription, enzymes in the replication process, or protein processing. This raises the question of synergy: Can several herbs be combined to amplify the antiviral effect? In most of the world's longstanding botanical traditions, that's how herbs are used\u2014in combination, not as single agents. The short answer is, Yes. Langland's team developed a core combination, and then added various fourth herbs, assessing the combinations against SARS-CoV-2. They found they could markedly increase the inhibitory effects\u2014sometimes by as much as five-fold over what would be predicted based on the profiles of the individual herbs. \"Our goal is to use botanicals to target different steps in the replication process, to create a truly synergistic blend for inhibiting replication of these viruses,\" he said. Artemisia annua (Wormwood) is another herb under intensive research at SCNM. Used widely worldwide to treat malaria, extracts of this herb are proving to be highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The effects are partially attributable to Artemisinin, a bioactive compound isolated from this plant in 1972 by Prof. Youyou Tu of the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medical Sciences. For her discoveries, Dr. Tu was awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Dr. Langland stressed that Artemisia produces many other compounds aside from artemisinin that may also contribute to its antiviral effects. As SCNM's researchers forge on with their projects, the Scalzo Institute is poised to become a major worldwide hub for the discovery and development of novel herbal formulas. Though none are yet ready for clinical prime-time, the potential is very clear. Vitamin D \"should be like masks. Everybody should know about it. The government agencies should be pushing it that way,\" says Congressman Glenn Grothman (R-WI). Grothman, representing Wisconsin's 6th congressional district, wants to see vitamin D become part of the nation's COVID control efforts. Last month, he introduced a resolution urging the federal agencies to \"recognize the significant role vitamin D may play.\" \"If passed, my resolution will unite the voice of the House of Representatives in the search for additional ways to limit the negative effects of COVID-19 and hopefully encourage our public health establishment to issue much-needed guidance as to truly how effective vitamin D can be in preventing serious symptoms, complications, or death from the coronavirus.\" While vitamin D has gotten considerable media attention in the last decade, Grothman told Holistic Primary Care that in his experience many people still do not realize its importance for maintaining overall health and, potentially, for improving immune system resilience against SARS-CoV-2. So far, none of the federal health agencies have openly advocated for wider use of vitamin D in the fight against COVID. The Biden administration, like its predecessor, has been silent on this subject. Challenging the Experts Grothman is a hard-right heartland conservative who makes no secret of his disdain for highly paid experts and academics who\u2014in his estimation\u2014lack common sense. He believes the government's unwillingness to advocate vitamin D\u2014a readily available, low cost, safe supplement-has done the public a disservice. \"You can't turn around without being told to wear a mask or stay six feet away from people. But there are people to this day who don't know about the benefits of vitamin D, and it's now 11 months after this pandemic broke. So, it seemed that somebody should be talking about it a little more.\" -Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-WI) He introduced his resolution (H.Res.116) to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on Feb. 11. It calls on the House to: (1) recognize the benefits of vitamin D intake against preventing respiratory complications and infection; (2) recognize the benefits of vitamin D intake for improved immune health and response; (3) recognize the correlation between vitamin D deficiencies and poor COVID-19 patient outcomes, including hospital stays, ICU admittance, and mortality; and (4) encourage the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration to update existing guidance and issue new guidance on vitamin D intake during the COVID-19 pandemic. Enthusiasm vs Evidence The scientific case for vitamin D in the COVID context is not quite as strong as Rep. Grothman's enthusiasm. There is a placebo-controlled intervention study of 40 people with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection showing that 60,000 IU of cholecalciferol per day improved viral clearance rates, and an open-label study indicating that addition of oral calcifediol on top of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine reduced ICU admissions in a cohort of 50 hospitalized COVID patients. As many commentators have pointed out, there are methodological holes to be found in nearly all of the published studies, and some question the logic of using vitamin D in a drug-like manner as a late-stage intervention for severely ill patients. \"Evidence to date suggests the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic sustains itself in large part through infection of those with low vitamin D, and that deaths are concentrated largely in those with deficiency. The mere possibility that this is so should compel urgent gathering of more vitamin D data.\" -Vitamin D for All Open Letter to World Leaders Though the epidemiologic data suggest that supplementation makes sense as a COVID prevention strategy, there are not yet any definitive studies showing that regular vitamin D use does, in fact, prevent transmission of the virus or that it will prevent infected people from developing symptoms. Grothman contends that the available evidence is strong and consistent enough to warrant a more serious governmental consideration of this vitamin in the context of COVID prevention. A Global Call In making his case, he cites an open letter signed by more than 200 physicians, researchers, and policymakers around the world, naming vitamin D deficiency as \"by far the most easily and quickly modifiable risk factor\" in the COVID-19 equation, and urging governments of all nations to \"immediately recommend and implement efforts appropriate to their adult populations to increase vitamin D, at least until the end of the pandemic.\" According to the letter's authors, \"Evidence to date suggests the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic sustains itself in large part through infection of those with low vitamin D, and that deaths are concentrated largely in those with deficiency. The mere possibility that this is so should compel urgent gathering of more vitamin D data.\" They urge world leaders to up the current Vitamin D recommendations to 4,000 IU daily (100 mcg) for adults (possibly more for darker-skinned people), to mandate routine serum vitamin D measurement for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and to supplement when warranted by the test results. \"The preponderance of evidence indicates that increased vitamin D would help reduce infections, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, & deaths. Why the Silence? Rep. Grothman, now in his 3rd term, has generally not been involved in healthcare policy over the course of his congressional tenure. He says he became interested in the vitamin D question last Fall after he became aware of research by David Meltzer at the University of Chicago showing strong inverse associations between vitamin D status and risk of COVID infection. Studies from all over the world indicated similar patterns. \"We started running across these articles more and more, and we wondered why this wasn't being pushed by the professionals. \"You can't turn around without being told to wear a mask or stay six feet away from people. But there are people to this day who don't know about the benefits of vitamin D, and it's now 11 months after this pandemic broke. So, it seemed that somebody should be talking about it a little more, and it's been very frustrating that the people we pay the big bucks to at the CDC have been largely mute,\" Grothman told Holistic Primary Care in an interview. For whatever it is worth, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease did quietly recommend, in an Instagram Live session with actress Jennifer Garner, that people with deficiencies take Vitamin D to reduce their susceptibility to COVID. The Institute itself, however, has not made any formal recommendations. Grothman says his impulse to raise the issue in Congress is entirely independent of financial interests. The initiative is not being funded by any supplement company or industry representatives. \"This is new stuff for me,\" he acknowledged. \"I'm taking it now, but I wasn't taking it before.\" Asked why public health officials have been so reluctant to mention vitamin D or, for that matter, any other supplements in the COVID guidelines, Grothman chose his words carefully: \"Cynical people would say\u2014and I hate to become cynical\u2014that they (the agencies) push stuff that people can make a lot of money on. But when it comes to alternative treatments, or prevention in the first place....you know, a bottle of vitamin D is pretty cheap...the interest seems to wane. Whereas if something more expensive, like a new drug, comes along a little more attention is paid to it.\" So, the basic profit motive? \"People tell me that, and I don't like to believe it. But why else would they be sitting on this?\" Grothman says. Though his resolution is focused exclusively on vitamin D, Grothman also has axes to grind about fenofibrate, hydroxychloroquine and other low-cost generic drugs that he believes are being ignored, under-utilized, or used too late. Seeking Bipartisan Support Whether the vitamin D resolution gains traction in the House will depend on whether Grothman can muster support from across the political divide. About this he is confident. \"No question there will be bipartisan support,\" he said, citing Rep. Salud Carbajal, from California's 24th district as a potential ally from among the Democrats. Carbajal is, himself, a COVID survivor. Grothman says his primary objective for the resolution is simply to \"wake them up a little bit,\" referring to Congress and the public health establishment. Even if it does not pass, it will have done its job if it can spark interest among legislators from both parties, and generate some meaningful dialog. The bill has gotten the attention of medical professionals, and several of the organizations representing holistic, functional, and naturopathic medicine have indicated tacit support. In early March, the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians issued a statement commending Rep. Grothman, \"for introducing a resolution before Congress that raises public awareness of vitamin D and calls for the FDA and other government agencies to study and recognize the connection between vitamin D deficiencies and COVID-19. As experts in natural medicine, licensed naturopathic doctors have long recognized and utilized the power of key vitamins, especially vitamin D, to help support the immune system.\" While AANP \"enthusiastically joins the call for our government's top public health agencies to issue guidance\" on vitamin D and COVID, the organization is not taking any direct action to promote it. The California Naturopathic Doctors Association has urged members to contact their representatives and voice their support. Patrick Hanaway, MD, coordinator of the Institute for Functional Medicine's COVID-19 Task Force, told Holistic Primary Care that from the perspective of biological plausibility and in alignment with the precautionary principle, it makes sense to incorporate vitamin D into public health policy around COVID. Most functional medicine practitioners believe it is a good thing to use with their patients, and IFM's \"Recommended Interventions\" for COVID-19 suggest that adults take 5,000 IU orally per day. But Hanaway points out that \"the conventional scientific community has not agreed that having normal values of vitamin D is associated with helping to support the immune system. This is something that continues to be discussed.\" IFM as an educational organization does not take official positions on political matters, and will not be issuing an official statement on the Grothman resolution, though the group supports it in principle. \"From my perspective I look at the science. This is a low-cost, low-risk intervention. We work with practitioners to try and educate them about that,\" Hanaway says. Kyle Turk, NPA's deputy director of governmental affairs, says its members have already generated roughly 500 letters urging members of congress to support the resolution. Though he stressed that NPA cautions its member companies against making COVID-related product claims\u2014which are considered to be unlawful drug claims by the FDA\u2014Turk says his organization is whole-heartedly behind the idea that things like vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, and many botanicals have a role to play in bolstering immune system resilence. He is hopeful about the prospects for the vitamin D resolution. \"As polarizing as healthcare can be, something like this should be a two-foot putt for Congress. We can all agree that the use of vitamins and minerals to support healthy immune system is important. This could be a great way to start building bipartisanship.\" The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound impact on all aspects of healthcare. Holistic, functional, and naturopathic medicine are no exceptions. Some of these changes are positive, opening new opportunities for natural medicine to demonstrate its value. Others pose serious challenges. Positive or negative, the impact of COVID will be felt long after the virus is contained. Learn how practitioners\u2014and organizations that represent them\u2014are adapting to the \"new normal,\" how the regulatory and medicolegal landscape is changing, and what the post-COVID future might look like. This free half-day program features presentations from leaders of the Institute for Functional Medicine, and the Academy of Integrative Health & Medicine, as well as regulatory experts, patient survey data, and perspectives from Holistic Primary Care. Since the earliest days of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Institute for Functional Medicine has taken a lead in the effort to compile, evaluate and disseminate practical information on nutritional and botanical interventions for immune system resilience, risk mitigation, and recovery from infection. Headed by Patrick Hanaway, MD, IFM's COVID-19 Task Force has also been helping clinicians make sense of the various testing methods, the mechanisms by which the virus enters and destroys human tissues, and the non-viral risk factors that increase susceptibility. This first of its kind course totals 6 hours of online content, delivered by 18 of IFM's expert faculty members. The presentations \"will explore clinical principles to reduce patient vulnerability to developing severe infection during the COVID-19 pandemic, increase resistance to infection, improve resilience to the more injurious consequences of infection, and optimize recovery from infection and its long-term consequences.\" Among the topics covered are: \u00b7 Lab testing - where and when \u00b7 Vulnerability from a systems biology perspective \u00b7 Lifestyle factors and the impact of implicit bias \u00b7 Viral mechanisms of action \u00b7 Mechanisms of action of pharmaceuticals, botanicals, and nutraceuticals \u00b7 Addressing the post-infectious phase: a comprehensive approach \u00b7 Case studies and group visit model \u00b7 Novel tools to use with patients Presenters include: Robert Luby, Joel Evans, Helen Messier, Deanna Minich, Yousef Elyaman, Kara Fitzgerald, Gary Goldman, and others. \"Functional medicine is especially well suited to support patients during the pandemic with its systems biology approach and commitment to individualized care across the healthspan,\" IFM states. The course is set up for on-demand streaming, and registrants will have access for a full year. It also includes periodic research updates, clinical pearls, and additional webinars as new information emerges and best practices evolve. The COVID pandemic, which began as a \"big city\" issue, is now upending daily life in rural areas that once appeared immune to its dangers. I live in such an area, and I'm witnessing first-hand how the pandemic\u2014and its economic, social, and political dynamics\u2014can wreak havoc in a small country town. As a former long-time resident of San Francisco, I relocated to Whitefish\u2014a town of about 7,500 people in western Montana\u2014in the Spring of 2019, just months before COVID swept the globe. The allure of this beautiful state\u2014especially to city dwellers\u2014is undeniable. For those looking to trade urban living for a quieter life in the country, Montana makes for a magical destination. Whitefish, and other towns like it, are prepared to handle vast numbers of seasonal tourists and small influxes of new transplants. Nothing could have prepared us for COVID and its aftermath. An Early Success? Montana is geographically one of the largest American states, though it is home to just over one million residents. Only its southern neighbor, Wyoming, and the state of Alaska have lower population densities than the Treasure State. By contrast, New York City\u2014an early COVID epicenter in the US\u2014alone houses more than 8 million people. Throughout the Spring, as caseloads rose in New York, Chicago, Washington, DC, and other major cities, Montana's naturally socially-distanced population combined with strict and swiftly enacted public health measures, helped keep Montana largely corona-free. Early on, coronavirus seemed to be an urban problem. Nonetheless, Montana's Governor, Steve Bullock, was among the first in the nation to close schools in mid-March. A stay-at-home directive shuttering non-essential businesses followed shortly afterwards. The order included a mandatory 14-day travel quarantine for individuals arriving in Montana from outside the state. The Western region quickly emerged as an early COVID success story. Over the first three months of the pandemic, Montana's daily confirmed coronavirus count peaked at just 35 cases. Gov. Bullock reported in April that daily cases were dropping, and that outside of Montana, \"very few [other] states in the country\" showed declining numbers. By midsummer, a dramatically different picture began to develop. Segments of the Montana economy started reopening in May, and on June 1, Gov. Bullock lifted the previously required 2-week quarantine for travelers. A few weeks later, COVID cases soared past the state's previous March peak\u2014and they've continued to climb since then. A confluence of factors, some unique to the American West and others more universal, are fueling the surge in Montana. Tourism Takes a Turn One key driver was a sudden rush of people flooding into the state to escape the virus. Summer tourists, mixed with an influx of newcomers seeking to rent or buy properties in Montana, came in droves from across the US. With them arrived wildly divergent perspectives on public health, safety, and freedom. Montana is home to two of the country's top 10 most-visited National Parks. Yellowstone straddles the Montana-Wyoming border, and Glacier National Park stretches just below Canada in the northwest. Many local economies rely upon tourism to stay afloat. In 2019, three million people\u2014triple the state's total population\u2014visited Glacier Park alone. Prior to 2020, the park was experiencing record annual rises in visitation. Within and beyond its parks, Montana's wide-open spaces, sparse population, and boundless opportunities for outdoor recreation, added to its appeal as an attractive oasis from the coronavirus. Towns like Whitefish are always awash in seasonal vacationers. But this summer, many travelers came to stay. Thousands of out-of-towners fled their home states to buy or rent in greener pastures across Montana. Sales of residential and commercial properties, as well as undeveloped land all skyrocketed, driving a massive real estate boom. Local realtors reported selling properties sight unseen to wealthy out-of-state buyers. Recent data gathered by Glacier Flathead Real Estate identified 48% sales growth over 2019's third quarter in Flathead County, with a massive 114% increase from 2020's second quarter. There were 995 residential sales in 2020's third quarter alone, versus fewer than 700 sales during the same period of 2019. Those numbers might not sound huge by New York or Los Angeles standards. But keep in mind that metropolitan Billing\u2014Montana's largest city\u2014has a total population of just over 180,000. A sudden real estate surge in small towns like Whitefish can destabilize established communities. The inpouring of outsiders this year has put tremendous and unexpected pressure on vital local resources, among them our public education system. School Surge A \"crazy hot\" rental market meant that housing was not immediately available to everyone suddenly scouring Montana's property listings. In highly sought-after ski resort towns, families arriving from out of state temporarily settled into motels and lodges, waiting for homes or rentals to come on the market. Some even used hotel addresses to register their children in local schools. School districts across the state reported major increases in enrollment for the 2020-21 school year. The Big Sky district near Yellowstone saw a 15% increase in the number of kids registered to attend area schools. Closer to Glacier, the Whitefish School District added 95 children from out of state to its student roster. In rural districts, even minor bumps in enrollment can overburden schools with limited resources. Some schools struggled with substitute teacher shortages as staff declined teaching positions due to fears about viral spread in the classroom. Economic Disparities The pandemic revealed and exacerbated Montana's widespread economic vulnerabilities. As measured by median household income and per capita income, this is one of the poorest states in the nation. Pandemic-induced business closures and job losses led to a huge jump in unemployment claims, forcing many to utilize food assistance programs. Food banks, many already understaffed and under-resourced, witnessed striking increases in the numbers of community members in need of food. Some programs reported a doubling\u2014or more\u2014of hungry individuals and families. As with the schools, many Montana food banks are scrambling to hire the staff needed to meet the rising demand, at a time when many people fear taking jobs that will expose them to the public. In highly-touristed areas, most local businesses weathered the initial months without major losses. But the pandemic introduced another set of stressors for small business owners in particular. One of these is the challenge of retaining employees. Some workers fear the virus itself, others fear the attitudes and behaviors of members of their own communities. In the tiny town of Libby, one restaurant suspended dining service after guests repeatedly abused staff. According to the restaurant's owners, the worst offenses included verbal harassment from tourists, and an incident involving regular guests who showed off their sidearms when asked to wear face masks inside the dining room. As the summer progressed, confirmed COVID cases in Montana climbed past previous high points. That trend continued into the Fall, with nearly half the state's confirmed cases occurring in the month of September alone. By the end of September, our single-day new case total was broken and surpassed 11 times. The state did not hit its highest daily case total until October 7\u2014and as of this writing, the count is still rising. In a surprising twist from the pandemic's earliest days, New York State formally added Montana to its COVID-19 travel advisory list in early September, requiring visitors from Montana to self-quarantine for 14 days once landing in New York. Protecting Tribal Communities As in other parts of the country, COVID has disproportionately affected Montana's poorest and most marginalized citizens. Nearly 90% of Montanans identify as White. The next largest group by race are American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) individuals, who comprise around 7% of the state's total population. There's mounting evidence that the coronavirus disproportionately impacts Native American communities. In Montana, DHHS data show that AI/AN patients accounted for 16% of all COVID cases statewide\u2014more than double the group's representation in the state population. This pattern is seen in tribal communities all over the country. In late August, the CDC issued a report indicating that the cumulative incidence of laboratory-confirmed COVID was 3.5 times greater among AI/AN individuals than among non-Hispanic Whites. Members of tribal communities often live in multigenerational households, increasing the likelihood of transmission across age groups. High rates of chronic illnesses like diabetes and hypertension put Native Americans, especially elders, at greater risk of harmful complications associated with COVID. In September, Montana's 17,000-member Blackfeet Nation saw a spike in coronavirus cases. Hundreds of families on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation were required to quarantine at home for two weeks. The shelter-in-place mandate came several months after a prior ordinance had restricted travel onto reservation land for the duration of the summer season. Initially, COVID cases on the reservation remained extremely low. Closed Roads The tribe's land borders the east side of Glacier and offers numerous points of entry into the million-plus acre national park. Roads entering the park pass right through reservation lands. The Blackfeet Tribal Business Council voted in late June to close the roads along the park's eastern boundary to help prevent the virus from entering its community. The Blackfeet also imposed numerous other public health measures, many of which were more stringent than the state's general ordinances. Tribal officials prohibited vacation rentals, closed all non-essential businesses and roads, and imposed a nightly curfew on reservation land. The Blackfeet road closures eliminated access to roughly half of Glacier Park. But that didn't stop masses of people from flocking there all summer long. The traffic restrictions simply funneled most visitors through a single main entrance in West Glacier, overwhelming those campgrounds, causing massive traffic jams, and creating unprecedented congestion both in and around the park. Social Friction Many Montanans bemoaned what they described as a tourist takeover of usually quiet areas. County law enforcement in the Glacier area reported an alarming increase in calls about conflicts between residents and visitors. Denied access to Glacier Park, tourists spilled out into less-visited parts of the state, in some cases failing to abide by area land use rules. Some pristine camping areas were looted and trashed, threatening the health and safety of wildlife. Lifelong Montanans described travelers and new arrivals as \"outsiders\" taking advantage of the rural terrain to suit their own personal interests with little regard for year-round residents. Others celebrated the boost these summer travelers gave to the region's economy. However, adding COVID into the mix dramatically changed the flavor of Glacier's tourism this year. Clinics Stretched Thin When cases began rising in June, those who contracted the virus weren't just lifelong Montanans\u2014they also included travelers and newcomers who'd recently moved here. Their presence added strain to a public health care system already under pressure long before the coronavirus reached the western frontier. Hospital capacity is a critical issue in any community, urban or rural. Are the area's medical facilities equipped to handle a sudden upsurge in sick patients? In the back-country regions, most are not. Like many other parts of rural America, Montana has for years faced significant shortages of medical professionals. Doctors, nurses, and mental health practitioners are in chronically short supply across the state. The US Department of Health and Human Services classifies more than 50 of Montana's 56 counties as \"Medically Underserved Areas/Populations (MUA/P)\" and/or \"Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSA).\" For many Montanans, the nearest medical care is hundreds of miles away. Several counties do not have any practicing doctors at all. Transportation is a major barrier to health care access. When a hospital in Billings was hit with a surge in COVID in the late summer, it had to bring in backup from out of state. As of mid-September, Billings' Yellowstone County accounted for 40% of Montana's known cases, though it accounts for around 15% of the state's population. Nurses, respiratory therapists, and technicians traveled in from three sister hospitals in Colorado to help relieve staff and keep the county's hospitals running. As in other parts of the country, many health practitioners here have shifted to telemedicine, a trend that's likely to continue long past the COVID era. But telehealth services aren't always an option in remote rural areas like this. Huge swaths of Montana remain disconnected from the digital world. That's part of the state's appeal. But in today's healthcare, it's a major disadvantage. Montana's age demographics further limit the effectiveness of telemedicine. The state has one of the country's oldest populations. Even in areas where patients can plug in, elders may resist transitioning to web-based medicine. Pre-COVID, the Montana Hospital Association was already cautioning that \"as our state ages, our health care needs continue to increase.\" The pandemic has only amplified the problem. Maskless in Montana On July 15, the governor's office issued a statewide directive requiring face coverings in most indoor spaces, and for certain outdoor events. The mask mandate rapidly became a source of both contention and confusion among tourists and locals alike. Resembling similar scenes playing out in small towns across the American West, many Montana residents simply refused to comply with the requirements. They cited Constitutional reasons for declining to wear masks, claiming that the mandate impinged on their personal freedoms. While the state's current governor is a Democrat, Montana residents are a predominantly Republican voter base. Political alliances deepened the sharp divide between the masked and the masked-not, raising new angles on the age-old question of what makes a \"true\" Montanan. The state responded with local Mask Up campaigns aimed at normalizing face coverings, and linking mask use with good sportsmanship, respect for neighbors, and other core Western values. But as new viral hotspots emerged, so did the number of heated anti-mask protests. In the seat of Flathead County, the town of Kalispell moved city council meetings to a virtual format after multiple in-person meetings were disrupted by groups of bare-faced anti-maskers protesting the state's face covering mandates. It wasn't just long-time residents who resisted masking up. Tourists from all over the country arrived maskless in Montana, expecting that anything goes in the Wild West. The situation was not helped by the lack of a coordinated national response, and the emergence of a patchwork of state-by-state policies that created uncertainty about what rules actually existed, and to whom they applied. Patchwork Policy More broadly, the authors of a recent MIT study argued that the nation's uncoordinated opening, closing, and reopening of state and county economies \"is making the COVID problem worse in the US.\" Researchers looked at the impact of state-by-state re-openings between January and July and found \"surprising and troubling results.\" The MIT team analyzed state-level COVID policies, data from over 22 million mobile devices, and the social media connections shared by 220 million Facebook users. They concluded that \"reimposing local social distancing or shelter-in-place orders after reopening may be far less effective than policy makers would hope.\" The researchers further argued that in some states, the shutdowns were in fact counterproductive, unintentionally encouraging those in locked down regions to flee to reopened regions, taking the virus with them, and creating new hotspots. \"We've seen a patchwork of flip-flopping state policies across the country,\" said the study's senior author, Sinan Aral. \"The problem is that, when they are uncoordinated, state re-openings and even closures create massive travel spillovers that are spreading the virus across state borders. If we continue to pursue ad hoc policies across state and regional borders, we're going to have a difficult time controlling this virus, reopening our economy or even sending our kids back to school.\" As of early autumn, Montana has yet to flatten the curve of its first COVID wave. What will follow in the months ahead is of grave concern among local medical practitioners. In October, a group of more than 280 Montana-based health care professionals issued an open letter urging community members to take the virus seriously and follow basic guidelines to prevent overwhelming the regional medical systems. \"COVID-19 is surging in our community and in Montana,\" the letter explains. \"The situation is more serious than it has ever been in our state. New case counts and hospitalizations are hitting record highs nearly every day and tragically more and more Montanans are losing their lives to this disease.\" As we brace for the winter season, the Montana experience serves as a cautionary tale to other rural regions assumed untouchable by the pandemic. For health insurers, the COVID pandemic has been a goldmine. At least so far. Across the nation, ordinary people and small businesses struggle with both the disease itself and the fiscal consequences of prolonged economic shutdown. Healthcare plans, on the other hand, are poised to make record profits this year. According to a mid-April NASDAQ report, seven of the biggest for-profit players\u2014UnitedHealth Group, Centene, Cigna, Anthem, Humana, Molina, and Magellan-are expected to turn \"positive earning surprises\" in 2020. For all of them, stock performances are surpassing previous years' projections. UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the nation's largest employer of medical professionals, saw a nearly 7% revenue rise in Q1 2020, reaching $64.4 billion. During that three-month period\u2014as COVID spread across the country-UHG's medical loss ratio decreased by 1% compared with Q1 2019. In laymen's terms, \"medical loss\" means money spent on actual medical care. Bull Run for Some Like other major insurers, UNH's stock price remained high throughout the first months of the pandemic. At the close of Q1, UNH was trading at $277.50 per share, up 2.6% from the beginning of the year; it continues to generate earnings and dividends. According to the company's Q1 report, \"Return on equity of 23.6% continued to reflect the company's strong overall margin profile. Dividend payments grew 19.1% year-over-year to $1.0 billion and the company repurchased 6.2 million shares for $1.7 billion in first quarter 2020.\" Yes, that's right. Instead of using its Q1 windfall to reduce premiums for furloughed workers and businesses tottering on the brink of bankruptcy, UnitedHealth bought back its own stock, to ensure that its stock prices remain buoyant. It is also noteworthy that UnitedHealth's president, Sir Andrew Witty, also CEO of UNH's highly profitable Optum division, took \"a leave of absence\" this Spring to work with the World Health Organization on COVID-19 vaccine development. Prior to UNH, Witty was CEO of the drug giant, GlaxoSmithKline. Aetna, is also having a bull run, despite the pandemic\u2014or perhaps because of it. CVS\u2014which owns Aetna\u2014reported a net income of $2.01 billion in the first quarter. In his Q1 2020 report, CEO Larry Merlo stated, \"Consolidated revenues increased 8.3% year-over-year with growth coming from all segments. Our business performance exceeded our expectations due in part to strong execution and our ability to meet elevated consumer and member needs resulting from COVID-19. We generated $3.3 billion of cash from operations and returned approximately $650 million to shareholders through cash dividends in Q1.\" Not all health insurance companies are booming. But most are doing just fine, prompting Moody's Investor Services to report in late May that, \"Coronavirus-related costs did not \"materially impact\" seven major health insurance companies' first quarter 2020 earnings, which increased slightly over last year.\" That's why Moody's predicts that the majors will remain profitable even if there is a second wave of COVID. Several factors play into the insurance industry's COVID cakewalk: Despite the economic shutdowns, insurers continue to collect premiums from employers, the federal government (for Medicare Advantage and other privatized federal insurance plans), and insured individuals. For most plans, the medical loss -that is, the percentage of premium revenue spent on actual care for beneficiaries\u2014is down significantly since the pandemic. That's because so many clinics have closed, and so much sub-acute, elective, and 'non-essential' care has been deferred. Prolonged quarantines, bans on large gatherings, and travel restrictions mean fewer auto and motorcycle accidents, sports injuries, and episodes of non-COVID infectious diseases. All of this translates into fewer people racking up medical bills that insurers must pay. The actual costs of COVID care are falling most heavily on federal payors, not private sector insurers. That's because people with severe COVID are disproportionately elderly (Medicare), poor (Medicaid), or uninsured. Fed Bears the Brunt To be sure, insurers face storms on the horizon. More than 40 million Americans have lost their jobs since the pandemic began, and several big employers have declared bankruptcy. That means significant losses in employer-based insurance revenue. It remains to be seen how many companies rebound, and how many of those jobs are restored once \"things go back to normal\"\u2014if ever they do. There could also be a massive surge in medical spending once clinics reopen and people who deferred office visits and non-acute care feel safe enough to return. But even in the face of these threats, the insurers have done much to ensure their future profitability (they are insurers, after all). For one, many newly unemployed people will likely end up on the federal tab\u2014either in Medicaid or Medicare\u2014or they will scrimp and save to buy private insurance on the open markets. Even if the big plans lose revenue from employer premiums, they'll likely save even more on reduced medical spending for beneficiaries they no longer have to cover. Further, a significant chunk of federal healthcare spending will end up going to the for-profit plans anyway, via the Medicare Advantage plans. According to Moody's, COVID-related unemployment \"will hurt fully insured commercial risk books of health insurers most, because membership will decline.\" But the unemployment \"will benefit the Medicaid and individual market [insurer] businesses, which will gain members.\" \"HEROES\" for Whom? The insurance industry's lobbyist sous-chefs have made sure the House of Representatives baked plenty of protections into the $3 trillion HEROES Act currently under Senate review. In an April 28 letter to Senate and House leaders, a coalition of 32 medical organizations and trade groups\u2014including the US Chamber of Commerce, and several insurance industry advocates\u2014called on lawmakers to ensure that the employer-based coverage system does not collapse. The coalition states that roughly 180 million Americans depend on job-based insurance\u2014a frequent insurance industry talk-point- and urges Congress to \"take immediate action to support employers and workers by protecting and expanding high quality, affordable health care coverage.\" The requested \"action\" includes: Subsidies to corporate employers that have lost revenue due to the pandemic and are forced to cut employee health benefits Full-cost offsets for COBRA coverage of people who've lost their jobs Expansion of \"qualified expenses\" in Health Savings Accounts, enabling people to use their HSAs to pay their insurance premiums A special enrollment period allowing people to buy insurance in the Health Insurance Marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act. Subsidies for insurance purchased through the Marketplaces Of course, it will take heroic efforts to get HEROES through the Republican-controlled Senate. The bill is a Democratic party initiative, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already voiced his opposition. Whatever the fate of HEROES, it is a safe bet that the insurance plans will remain profitable. \"The one thing these companies know how to do is to make money, to assure their shareholders of a return on investment that Wall Street expects,\" says Wendell Potter, a former insurance industry communications director turned whistle-blower. Potter spent 15 years as the Vice President of Corporate Communications for Cigna, before a crisis of conscience obliged him to leave an industry he now sees as rapacious and only out for its own good, usually at the expense of patients and practitioners. Protecting Profitability \"Insurance companies are really going to have a stellar year this year, because of the pandemic. And one of the reasons for that is because of all the elective procedures that have been cancelled or postponed. They're not going to happen this calendar year. Some of those will never be rescheduled because unfortunately some of those individuals have died by now, or will die,\" Potter said in a recent interview with Holistic Primary Care. His experience in the corporate board rooms over decades has shown him that insurers are quite capable of weathering social and economic storms. \"Since the ACA was passed, insurance companies have made alot of money. They've made record profits even with the restrictions that the ACA brought to the industry. The insurers can no longer refuse to sell coverage to people with preexisting conditions or charge people more because of their health status. But they can still charge older folks more than the younger people. And they've really ramped up prior authorization requirements. They've shifted more and more people into high deductible plans. They're increasingly refusing to pay for coverage if you go out of network willingly or unwittingly,\" says Potter, author of the 2010 book, Deadly Spin, which chronicles how the insurance industry manipulates public policy to its own advantage. \"So, there are things they put into place that are barriers to care, that protect their profits. Even if revenues drop next year, they will still have these things in place: people will still be in high deductible plans, probably more of them. And they can manage \"medical expenses\" in a certain way that, I would imagine their profit margins are not going to be adversely affected. Even with the drop-off in health plan enrollment and revenue, they still know how to convert their revenues to profit.\" COVID & Collusion After several decades in the health insurance business, Potter says he's rarely surprised by the degree of collusion between the big plans and the government. But even he was taken aback when the Trump administration announced in April that it was contracting with UnitedHealth Group to oversee and disburse $26 billion in federal relief funds to COVID-stricken hospitals. Rather than running the money through its usual Medicare and Medicaid payment channels, the government chose UnitedHealth\u2014the country's largest private, for-profit insurer-to administer and distribute the massive sum to hospitals and clinics that are running aground financially, owing to the impact of COVID. UNH claims it is not profiting on the deal, and that the $1 million administrative fee that the government is paying will be donated to further hospital relief. Friends in High Places In his announcement of this arrangement, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar claimed that UNH was better positioned \"to expedite\" the distribution of the money to hospitals where it is needed. Potter says he smells a rat. \"The government, through CMS, makes payments to healthcare providers every single day. They've been doing it for more than 50 years. Why would you think that a private company could do it more expeditiously when they don't even do business with all the hospitals in the US? \"They (UNH) are big. But they're not as big as Medicare. They don't have as many doctors and hospitals in their networks as does the Medicare program. So why in the world would the federal government turn to a private company that actually has fewer doctors and hospitals in network than Medicare? There's no logical reason for that, except that it was a favor. It's an example of what happens when you have friends in high places.\" The insurance industry is one of the largest sources of political campaign funding. United, being the biggest player on the field, doles out a lot of campaign cash on both sides of the aisle. According to the Center for Responsive Politics' Opensecrets.org website, UnitedHealth\u2014through its political action committees and through donations by individual executives\u2014is ranked number 126 in a list of 5,500 biggest Washington lobbyists, and 111th in a list of over 19,000 sources of campaign contributions. Potter points out that President Trump himself, as well as Vice President Mike Pence, CMS Administrator Seema Verma, who was a close advisor to Pence, and many top officials in the administration are, \"very favorable to private industry, to private insurance companies.\" Push for Privatization \"They strongly encourage people to enroll in Medicare Advantage plans. They want to convert the Medicare program to a program that is entirely run by the (private) insurance companies. That has long been an objective of a number of Republican politicians. Over the years they just developed relationships with the executives of these big companies, as they have sought to turn more and more of these public programs over to private insurers.\" Steven Parente, of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, is among the people in charge of managing the hospital COVID relief program. Prior to this position, he served as a business consultant to a number of major corporations, including\u2014guess who? UnitedHealth Group. As reported on the Politico website earlier this year, just a few months after Trump installed Parente in his current HHS post, UnitedHealth made a $1.2 million multi-year donation to Parente's research center at the University of Minnesota. A curious coincidence, is it not? Beyond UNH's involvement in distributing the money, there are other questionable issues regarding the government's hospital bail-out plan. Disbursement of the $26 billion is based on how much hospitals were reimbursed in 2019 under the traditional Medicare Fee for Service programs\u2014that is, Medicare Part A and Part B contracts. Critics, like Erin O'Malley, senior policy director for America's Essential Hospitals, is concerned that the plan will direct more money into the hospitals with big private-sector Medicare Advantage contracts, and less into those with high proportions of \"traditional\" Medicare and uninsured patients. \"We're worried that by only looking at Medicare fee for service revenues, it could tilt the playing field against some of our members that have a disproportionate share of uninsured as well as Medicaid patients,\" said O'Malley, in an interview posted on CNBC in April. Sheep's Clothing Wendell Potter says that in times of crisis\u2014like the current pandemic\u2014insurers go into overdrive trying to make themselves look like good guys, concerned with public well-being. Case in point, Potter's former employer- Cigna\u2014and its announcement that it will waive \"all customer cost-sharing and co-payments for COVID-19 treatment.\" \"Our customers with COVID-19 should focus on fighting this virus and preventing its spread,\" said David M. Cordani, the company's president and CEO, whose personal compensation package totaled more than $19 million last year. \"While our customers focus on regaining their health, we have their backs. Our teams of experts are working around the clock to support front line health care workers, increase flexibility for hospitals, and deliver greater peace of mind to those we serve.\" Dropping co-payments? Sounds generous. Potter says it's little more than corporate PR. Several other major insurers have also waved the banner of altruism by similarly dropping co-pays and cost-shares on COVID-related care. The website for America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the industry's biggest trade organization, has a list of all the big insurers and their official responses to COVID. That's because if you look at the fine print, you'll see that the insurers are allowing their corporate customers with self-insured plans to opt out of this philanthropic display. \"In other words, these rules they say they're putting in place, apply only to the people who are in the so-called \"fully insured\" health insurance plans. All their employer customers (ie the self-insured plans) have the opportunity to opt out. Who knows how many are opting out?! There is no way of knowing that. AHIP will not tell you that.\" No Standardization Most Americans get their insurance via their jobs. Most of the large employers\u2014the big corporations\u2014are self-insured, which means they can opt-out of the insurance industry's magnanimous offer to eat the copayments. As a result, ordinary Americans might read the statements on the AHIP site and think that the waived cost-shares apply to them, only to find out that their particular companies have opted out. Potter says there's similar variability within the Medicare Advantage plans. \"Cigna might be doing it (dropping COVID co-pays). But Aetna might not be doing it. Humana might be doing it, but Anthem might not. So, it really depends on what specific plan you are enrolled in, even if they're all \"Medicare Advantage\" plans. \"So, it's all over the place. There's no standardization. You cannot believe what these health plans are saying, nor is there any reason to have certainty that they're going to be doing the right thing for all the people enrolled in their health plans.\" To the extent that insurers really are waiving COVID costs for ordinary Americans, this is a positive step. But rest assured that on the insurance industry's priority list, the public good comes well below profitability, CEO compensation, and shareholder return. Doctor suicide is a painful reality that hospitals, clinic networks, and medical schools go out of their way to deny. But with the emergence of a documentary called Do No Harm, and a surge of media attention following the suicide of Dr. Lorna Breen during New York City's first COVID peak, healthcare leaders are finally being forced to reckon with the ugly truth that in many institutions, medicine has become a culture of abuse. American physicians kill themselves at an alarmingly high rate. A least one doctor commits suicide every day in the US, according to research presented two years ago at the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting. Investigators at the Harlem Hospital Center in New York conducted a systematic literature review of physician suicides and identified a staggering rate of 28 to 40 per 100,000--more than twice the general population's suicide rate of 12.3 per 100,000. The review also showed that doctors have the highest suicide rate among all professions, including jobs in other high-stress fields like the military or law enforcement. Those statistics were identified before COVID-19. In 2020, the pandemic is only accelerating existing trends. Stories of medical professionals lost to suicide in the last 5 months are shining new light on long-standing and dangerous shortcomings in our systems of medical education and practice. Hazards of duty? Part of the deal? Comes with the territory? Only if that \"territory\" is the United States. Medicine is a high-pressure job anywhere. But doctors in other countries are not killing themselves at nearly the rates of their American counterparts. According to a 2019 systematic review by Dutheil and colleagues, US physicians are far more likely to commit suicide than their peers worldwide. Medical suicide rates have been rising in this country over the last decade; in Europe, they've actually been decreasing. Why do so many American doctors and medical students take their own lives? And why aren't their deaths more widely publicized? Wible believes guilt, bullying, and exhaustion are three leading causes of suicide in medicine. Physicians, med students, and other healthcare personnel are often subjected to abusive, even dangerous, working conditions. Overwork is common; self-care is penalized. In many hospitals and clinics, the inevitable pressures of medical practice are compounded by conflicting administrative demands, hostile work environments, retaliatory office politics, racial discrimination, and sexual harassment. It all adds up. \"'Burnout' is victim-blaming, and deflects attention from the hazardous working conditions that are illegal in any other industry that values safety, and the human rights violations that are rampant in medical education and beyond.\" \u2014Pamela Wible, MD Hazing & \"Pimping\" It begins with the rigors of medical education, and extends through insurance-based medicine's emphasis on volume over quality. Young physicians in training are frequently subjected to sanctioned abuse and public humiliation in lecture halls and hospital wards. They're also severely sleep-deprived\u2014itself a form of torture. For some suicidal doctors, the problems began when they entered medical school. Med students are typically high-achievers accustomed to ranking at the top of their classes. Once in med school though, some feel for the first time in their lives that they might not really be smart enough, tough enough, or brave enough to become \"good\" doctors. Within medical culture, there's a pervasive fear of being weak, unintelligent, or incapable. That fear drives people to hide their mistakes and imperfections and shy away from seeking help, even when it's desperately needed. Some level of pressure and anxiety is to be expected in a career as demanding as medicine. But Dr. Wible sees shockingly toxic elements in US medical culture. Bullying, humiliation, and hazing are tolerated, sometimes even encouraged as acceptable training strategies. Many doctors can tell stories of getting \"pimped,\"--an aggressive, rapid-fire style of testing students' clinical knowledge by asking difficult or intentionally unanswerable questions in class, in the clinic, and even in front of patients. All that takes its toll. A 2016 study of med students by the National Institutes of Health and the US Department of State found that, \"overall prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms among medical students was 27.2%, and the overall prevalence of suicidal ideation was 11.1%.\" Among those who screened positive for depression, only 16% sought treatment (Rotenstein, L et al. JAMA. 2016; 316(21): 22142236). \"There seems to be more mental health distress among first and third-year med students, and definitely for unmatched graduates. In some residency programs, 75% of residents meet criteria for major depression,\" Wible says. Med students experiencing depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts avoid seeking care because they worry they'll be \"outed,\" stigmatized, and punished if they do. The stress and pressure--and subsequent mental health risks--only increase once they transition into actual clinical practice. They enter an extremely hierarchical system in which they're often forced to \"earn their keep\" by filling the most undesirable shifts. Long hours without breaks; weekend and holiday shifts with little time off; isolation from friends, family, and crucial social support\u2014these are not exceptions, but rather the rule for many young doctors. Sleep Starvation Sleep deprivation is also a big factor, says Wible. It is not hard to find a physician who can tell tales of falling asleep, or witnessing colleagues drop unconscious to the hospital floor, while making rounds, treating patients, or conducting surgeries. Perhaps you've been one of them. In other high-stress professions-pilots, air traffic controllers, even truck drivers, for example-there are regulations and work-hour restrictions that limit shift lengths, because everyone recognizes that sleep deprivation and overwork impair performance. Yet our medical system drives doctors\u2014who routinely deal with matters of life and death that hinge on clear, quick judgment\u2014to the point of exhaustion. Current ACGME requirements permit interns' duty shifts to run for 24 consecutive hours--up from a previous cap of 16 hours--and 80 total hours per week. Not only do we permit sleep-starved doctors to administer potentially dangerous drugs, monitor patients on a complex array of equipment, and perform surgeries that require great skill--we expect them to do it all flawlessly--and to be nice about it. In other high-stress professions...there are regulations and work-hour restrictions, because everyone recognizes that sleep deprivation and overwork impair performance. Yet our medical system drives doctors\u2014who routinely deal with matters of life and death that hinge on clear, quick judgment\u2014to the point of exhaustion. Exhausted doctors are more likely than well-rested ones to make medical errors, which sometimes kill patients. A 2018 Mayo Clinic study found that physicians who made errors were more likely to exhibit symptoms of fatigue, burnout, and recent suicidal ideation (Tawfik, D et al. Mayo Clin Proc. 2018; 93(11): 1571-1580). When Epidemics Collide COVID-19 presented new and unusual stressors for clinicians in viral epicenters like New York City, Washington, DC, and Chicago, where prevalence was highest during the early months of the pandemic. Emergency medicine physicians and nurses are particularly vulnerable. In centers with very high caseloads they're working under constant duress, sometimes without adequate protective equipment, in hospitals that were understaffed even before the pandemic. As they treat their patients, they worry about their own risk, and the potential for carrying the virus home to their families. Dr. Wible, who has provided counselling for suicidal clinicians for nearly a decade, says that since the coronavirus, she's seen a dramatic increase in the number of calls. \"Volume doubled, and I led group support calls on Zoom to handle the uptick in requests for support,\" she reported. On April 26, Dr. Lorna Breen, a well-respected ER doctor at New York Presbyterian's Allen Hospital in New York City died of \"self-inflicted injuries\" at age 49. Her story got the media's attention, as it represented the convergence of two epidemics: COVID and doctor suicide. Prior to her death, Dr. Breen had treated many coronavirus patients, and she herself had recently recovered from the virus. \"Make sure she's praised as a hero, because she was,\" Breen's father, also a doctor, told the New York Times. \"She's a casualty just as much as anyone else who has died.\" The elder Dr. Breen also stressed that his daughter, \"did not have a history of mental illness.\" In its official public statement, New York Presbyterian used similarly valiant language. \"Dr. Breen is a hero who brought the highest ideals of medicine to the challenging front lines of the emergency department.\" But an email to hospital staffers did not immediately identify the cause of Breen's death, reflecting an attitude of denial and obfuscation that Wible says is the rule, not the exception, among hospital administrators. Breen's family and hospital \"had to use 'healthcare hero' propaganda on her immediately, so that she wasn't forgotten or thrown to the wind as weak,\" Wible told Holistic Primary Care. \"They gave her the hero spin because she was in New York City and had a high position in her hospital. Her family made it clear that she never had any preexisting medical conditions and instead suggested her death was due to the coronavirus, to distance her and the family from the topic of mental health issues.\" This denial contradicts evidence Wible has gathered from the nearly 1,500 cases she has recorded. She finds that ER doctors rank among the top three medical specialists most likely to die by suicide. Psychiatrists, surgeons, and anesthesiologists also have a higher risk than others. Secondary Trauma Wible believes secondary trauma plays a big role, at least for the latter two specialties. Breen's family insists that she never suffered from prior mental health challenges, but Wible says it's hard to imagine that a doctor who spent her entire career in the ER never suffered a single blow to her emotional or cognitive wellbeing. \"I believe all emergency medicine doctors have mental health wounds,\" Wible said. It is common to hear clinicians say that experiencing or witnessing a catastrophic injury or illness early in life is what inspired them to pursue medical careers. Wible finds that \"many EM doctors have experienced significant trauma in their childhoods--then they go into emergency medicine and are re-traumatized every day.\" Even those who did not experience childhood trauma will invariably incur \"occupationally-induced mental health wounds\" while working in the emergency department. \"If they have not sought appropriate care, then they are still wandering around with those wounds every day,\" she said. It's Not \"Burnout,\" It's Abuse \"This is tough work, even on the best day,\" Wible says of the medical life. \"Even in the parts of medicine that seem like they could be happy, there is unforeseen, extreme tragedy.\" In our current systems, the inevitable stresses and pressures of caring for sick, injured, and sometimes dying people, are amplified by factors unrelated to patient care. Micromanagement by senior doctors or hospital administrators; incessant demands for documentation; veiled threat of punishment or legal consequences for errors; poorly managed and understaffed clinics; incessant time pressures. All these factors leave many physicians feeling not only emotionally exhausted, but cynical towards the profession they once loved. We call it \"burnout.\" But Dr. Wible warns that this term obscures the abusive nature of our medical system itself. \"'Burnout' is victim-blaming, and deflects attention from the hazardous working conditions that are illegal in any other industry that values safety, and the human rights violations that are rampant in medical education and beyond.\" Hospitals treat physicians in ways that \"break the UN Declaration of Human Rights,\" she suggested. Other medical professionals also experience extreme pressure, overwork, and abuse. But statistically, the suicide risk is much higher for physicians. Hidden in Plain Sight Part of the problem is physicians' uncanny ability to hide their suffering not only from colleagues and supervisors, but from family members and friends. Doctors who experience depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideations often view those symptoms as flaws that must never be exposed. Some worry that admitting psychological or emotional distress will call into question their fitness to practice or, worse, might lead to dismissal. There may also be expectations from family and friends that someone who has \"made it\" in such a high-status profession must surely be reaping rewards. Some doctors feel a sense of duty not to disappoint parents, spouses, or other loved ones who've also invested and sacrificed to make their medical careers possible. As a result, few people know when a doctor friend or family-member is contemplating suicide. Dr. Wible\u2014who had her own struggles with anxiety and suicidality earlier in her career\u2014says there are a few red flags: \"Excessively happy doctors are often hiding their emotions and pain.\" Additional warning signs may include a recent medical liability case, medical board complaints or investigations, and major life events like divorce. Denial: A Double Assault Denial by hospital administrators, family members, and colleagues has only compounded the problem of doctor suicide. \"We create the scenario that takes these wonderful young people and puts them in a situation where they can see the only way out is death--and then we bury their suicides,\" Wible said. \"It's like a double assault.\" She pointed out that a number of doctor suicides involving ingestion of prescription drugs were misleadingly reported as \"accidental\" overdoses. It is certainly possible for physicians to unintentionally take too much medication, but this explanation stretches credibility. MDs get extensive training in pharmaceutical use; that makes them some of the least likely people on the planet to unknowingly over-consume a drug. Doctors do, however, have ready access to controlled substances, which heightens risk of abuse. According to a 2013 study published in the Journal of Addiction Medicine, 69% of doctors reported that they abused prescription drugs \"to relieve stress and physical or emotional pain\" (Merlo, L et a. J Addict Med. 2013; 7(5): 349-53). Physicians also possess an intimate and detailed knowledge of human anatomy, increasing the chances that they will complete a suicide if attempted. Concealing doctor suicides protects medical schools and hospitals from having to address systemic problems. But sweeping the dirty secrets under the rug only puts other health professionals--and their patients--at tremendous risk. \"Suicide is not the problem; censorship is,\" Wible argued. \"If we would just speak openly about this crisis, it could be easily solved.\" Effective, evidence-based suicide prevention tools exist--and they can help avert the needless loss of doctors' lives. \"We have the resources to solve this problem. But if we censor it, we can't make it better. We can't solve a problem that nobody is acknowledging.\" Get Up, Stand Up Wible says that to truly shift medical culture in a healthier direction, \"we need to normalize the conversation about suicide risk, just like we've normalized conversations about blood pressure.\" Education is also vital. Two resources she recommends are the documentary \"Do No Harm\" by filmmaker, Robyn Symon, and her free audiobook of doctor suicide notes, Physician Suicide Letters\u2014Answered, in which she shares her correspondence with numerous clinicians whom she's helped to avoid suicide. The key, she says, is providing a forum for self-expression without fear of rebuke or humiliation. \"The system of medical education and practice should be set up in a way where people are able to connect with each other honestly, emotionally and spiritually, without punishment,\" Wible said. Fixing the situation will also require system-wide reforms to create more humane working conditions within medical institutions. Wible believes doctors, nurses, med students, and other health professionals need to stand up and fight for those reforms. The book documents a spectrum of abusive situations-from food and sleep deprivation to threatening foreign-born doctors and trainees with deportation-that routinely occur in American clinics. It also gives guidelines to help doctors chronicle their own experiences of abuse, and practical action steps for confronting and resolving these situations. Dr. Wible is certainly not the only physician concerned with doctor suicide, and pushing for change. Keith Frederick, an osteopath who also served for eight years in Missouri's House of Representatives, introduced a bill to address mental health in Missouri medical schools after learning that a fourth-year osteopathic student in his community died by suicide just days before graduation. In the film Do No Harm, Dr. Frederick described suicide as an unacknowledged \"occupational hazard\" in medical settings. During his years as a legislator (2011-2019), he also sponsored a bill requiring hospitals to examine mental illness and burnout among staff. Not surprisingly, Frederick's proposal met initial resistance from Missouri medical institutions. The deans of all six of the state's med schools co-authored a letter urging legislators not to pass the bill. Ultimately, though, Frederick and his supporters won-out. The \"Show-Me Compassionate Medical Education Act\" (MO Senate Bill 52) was signed into law in July 2017. It requires medical schools to provide incoming students with information about available depression and suicide prevention resources. It also granted medical institutions the authority to conduct internal research, without penalty, on rates of depression, suicide, and other mental health issues among medical students. Thank a Doctor, Save a Life In addition to raising awareness around suicide risk and prevention, expressions of gratitude can literally help keep doctors alive. Wible encourages people to \"please show appreciation and give thank you cards to your doctors, and ask them how they are doing.\" It might seem simplistic or even silly, but she believes it can be life-saving. \"It can be very hard to reach doctors--they're often so closed off emotionally. It's important that they feel validated, normal, and appreciated.\" A thank you letter may give a doctor a much-needed dose of positive reinforcement that he or she may not otherwise receive. Verbal thanks are nice too, but Wible says that penned messages carry an even greater and longer-lasting power. \"Thank you notes are huge--especially if they are written. They have a lifespan that goes on for decades--doctors will read and reread them, sit and stare and really soak in the words.\" Clinics and hospitals might also consider setting up anonymous compliment boxes where staff and patients alike can submit thank you notes to their doctors or colleagues. She also urges medical practitioners to prioritize their own health and self-care. She herself does this by \"spend[ing] a lot of time in nature, hiking, gardening, and with my animals.\" She also stressed the importance of strong social connections, like the one she shares with her loving partner. \"And most important,\" she added, \"I get therapy WEEKLY.\" She holds that all med students and doctors should receive \"non-punitive, 100% confidential therapy\" every week. Whether it's for preventive or active treatment, breaking down the barriers around mental health support could help avert the tragic doctor suicides on which our current systems prefer to turn a blind eye.
