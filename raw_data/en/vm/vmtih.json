Coordination of Ben efits Coordination of Benefits (COB) is a process, regulated by law, which determines the financial responsibility for payment when a Member has coverage under more than one plan.

Determination of primary coverage is as follows: For a Group Medical Insurance Qualified Health Plan: A Group Medical Insurance Qualified Health plan providing pediatric dental essential health benefits is the primary carrier for such covered services. This applies to plans provided on the California Health Benefit Marketplace and to plans provided outside such Marketplace. For Dependent Children covered under Group Dental Plans: The determination of primary and secondary coverage for Dependent children covered by two parents' plans follows the birthday rule. The plan of the parent with the earlier birthd ay (month and day, not year) is the primary coverage. Different rules apply for the children of divorced or legally separated parents; contact the Member Services Department if you have any questions. Coverage under Access Dental and another pre -paid den tal plan: When an Access Dental Member has coverage under another prepaid dental plan, whether Access Dental is the primary or the secondary coverage, PCD may not collect more than the applicable Patient Charge from the Member.
