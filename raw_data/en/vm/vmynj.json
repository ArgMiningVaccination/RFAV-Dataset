The goal is to boost up your ability to remove cellular waste products and cleanse the blood. Included are: Apo-HEPAT: The primary remedy for stimulating and regulating vital metabolic liver functions, which include the crucial duties of excretion, detoxification and phagocytosis. This remedy also regulates gallbladder and pancreatic function. In addition, apo-HEPAT drops support key liver functions whenever chronic illnesses are present or to prevent their onset. RENELIX: Supports the excretion of hard calcium deposits in the kidney cells and helps restore normal kidney function. Proper function of the kidneys, liver and lymphatic system are a prerequisite for an effective immune response, as well as efficient excretion of toxins that accompany bacterial and viral infections. This remedy is always indicated when an elevated level of uric acid is discovered. ITIRES: Eliminates local and systemic inflammation of the lymphatic tissues, helps reduce swollen glands and promotes the efficient flow of the lymph. Pathogenic conditions that benefit from this remedy include lymphatic infections and blockages, swollen nodes, acute infections of the organs and all pus-producing infections (bronchitis, tonsillitis), mumps, swelling of the breast glands and neoplasm. Receive 1 50 mL bottle of each remedy - best used together. Suggested Uses: periodic cleanse as a wellness tool, to assist healing from environmental toxin exposure (like mold), when dealing with chronic fatigue and other whole body chronic illness. A wellness consult with Zoa is required upon pickup so we can set you up for detox success!
