It can also help stabilize the mood and emotions, calming anxiety and feelings of grief while also working to enhance concentration and fight fatigue. If you need relaxing and focusing, [Rosemary](/products/rosemary-essential-oil) and [Bergamot](/products/bergamot-fcf-essential-oil) are good replacements if you don't have Petitgrain in your collection. Muscle Aches: Got sore muscles? Petitgrain oil can help to both soothe tight muscles and ease muscle spasms you may experience. If you're sore but don't have Petitgrain, don't worry! You can still find relief from Peppermint, Chamomile, or Rosemary oil. Skin Care: Petitgrain is great for the skin. It works particularly well on sensitive skin, and it can help even out your skin tone while fighting acne and reducing blemishes. If you don't have Petitgrain to add to your skincare routine, try using Lavender or Cedarwood instead. Myrtle Myrtle Aromatic Substitutes: With its many benefits, Myrtle is an excellent essential oil very similar to [Tea Tree](/products/tea-tree-essential-oil). Because of this, Tea Tree makes a great aromatic substitute if you don't have Myrtle on hand. Another great oil substitute with a similar aroma is Cajeput.

Nutmeg Nutmeg Aromatic Substitutes: Many of us are familiar with the spicy, warm, slightly nutty aroma of Nutmeg, but if you need it for a recipe and don't have a bottle, what can you use in its place? Try some other spicy-smelling oils like or [Ginger](/products/ginger-root-essential-oil). Aches and Pains: Nutmeg's warming effect works great on tight, sore muscles or stiff, achy joints.

Aphrodisiac: Get the blood flowing and the romance going with Nutmeg! This spicy oil can help boost libido while easing tension to create an environment for romance. For those nights you don't have Nutmeg on hand, try using Cinnamon Bark or Black Pepper for a similar effect. Dill Dill Aromatic Substitutes: A classic herb oil, Dill oil certainly has an aroma that is more unique but that many of us love! However, this oil is more unfamiliar to some people, so if you find yourself in need of a replacement oil, [Coriander](/products/coriander-essential-oilcoriander-essential-oil) offers a similar smell. Digestion Aid: Dill is known for its ability to support proper digestion. It helps stimulate the process while aiding in the prevention of bloating or irregularity.

If you don't have Angelica Seed at home, you can replace it with Fennel, Dill, [Coriander](/products/coriander-essential-oilcoriander-essential-oil), or [Thyme](/products/thyme-essential-oil) for a similar aroma. Body Detox: Angelica Seed oil is both a diuretic and a diaphoretic. This means it supports your body's natural detoxification process by increasing urination and sweating. If you're looking for a good detox session but don't have Angelica Seed, try using [Juniper Berry](/products/juniper-berry-essential-oil), Lemon, Eucalyptus, or Ginger instead. Digestion Aid: Like many other oils, Angelica Seed supports your body's natural digestion process by stimulating digestion and supporting proper function. For those times when you don't have Angelica Seed but what better digestion, Coriander and Cardamom make great substitutes. Spearmint Spearmint Aromatic Substitutes: As one of the most refreshing minty oils, Spearmint offers an aroma similar to its cousin, [Peppermint](/products/peppermint-essential-oil); however, Spearmint is a tad bit sweeter than its counterpart. If a recipe calls for Spearmint but you don't have it, Peppermint is always a good substitution. You can also try Cornmint.

If you're looking for alternatives to this natural cleaner, Lemon, Tea Tree, Sage, and Cinnamon Bark are great choices. Wintergreen Wintergreen Aromatic Substitutes: Another favorite, Wintergreen is Peppermint's sweeter cousin, offering a similar aroma with less herbal overtones. Although Peppermint isn't quite as sweet, it is a great aromatic substitute for Wintergreen, as is its other cousin, [Spearmint](/products/Spearmint-essential-oil). Respiratory Health: In the cold and flu season, it's easy to get congestion, experience aches and pains, develop a cough, and more. Wintergreen can help open the airways and ease aches so that you can feel better. It can also help fight against germs to increase your chances of staying healthy. If you don't have Wintergreen, you can get similar benefits from Eucalyptus, Basil, or Oregano. Skin and Hair Care: With natural antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and astringent properties, Wintergreen is great at protecting your skin from bacteria, fighting acne, soothing an itchy scalp, and soothing irritated skin.

Picking Your Own Essential Oil Substitutes If you are looking for additional essential oil substitutes, you can always pick your own oil. When choosing an essential oil to replace another, it is important to note that no two oils are exactly the same. While we can't expect to experience the exact same effects when replacing an oil, we sure can get close! When choosing your own essential oil substitute, remember that there are two main types of substitutions: aromatic and therapeutic. An aromatic substitute is simply when you wish to switch one oil for another that has a similar aroma. This can be the case for diffuser blends, perfumes, body or room sprays, or scented lotion. If you are looking to substitute an oil for aromatic purposes, you will want to replace it with one that has a smell in the same aromatic category. For example, substitute a floral oil with a floral oil, or a spicy oil with another spicy one, and so on. Therapeutic Essential Oil Substitutes A therapeutic essential oil substitute focuses on replacing one oil for another that has similar benefits. No two oils are alike, and while many offer the same benefits, there will be some tradeoffs. Some substituted oils may be closer to the one you are replacing than others, but oftentimes there are many that offer the same benefit, in addition to others. When choosing to substitute an oil for therapeutic purposes, we recommend replacing it with an oil whose dominating benefits are similar to the ones you're replacing. For example, substitute an oil known to help with skin with another that has dominating skin benefits. You don't have to have a bottle of every single essential oil in order to experience the many benefits that they offer. Whether your collection is large or small, you can still follow essential oil recipes by substituting oils and experimenting with what you have.
