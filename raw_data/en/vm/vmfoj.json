She was a whirlwind of feel-good things, from her bright red lipstick to her fondness for dark chocolate. She loved rousing discussions, family dinners, and welcoming those who didn't have family nearby to call their own. Her laughter was big like her opinions, while her hugs were the coziest of comforters on a frosty night. She believed that \"you can never spoil a child,\" and if there were a recipe for grandma's, hers would get ve-star reviews. A long time has passed since her smile brought warmth to my day, but the impression my grandmother, Margaret Isely, left on me hasn't faded. The incredible thing is, she lives up to the legend in the hearts and memories of everyone who knew her. I think her daughter said it best: \"Margaret was presence. She lived the life that made a di erence.\" It's Women's History Month, and for our family and Natural Grocers that means celebrat- ing the spirit of the woman who helped start it all. Margaret Isely\u2014the legend, co-founder, mother, grandmother, and everyday woman. She lives in the details of Natural Grocers, in the history that makes us who we are today. /uni00A0 When we talk about our dedication to Nutrition Education, she ignited the passion. She taught us that nutrition is the foundation for wellbeing, and knowledge about it is one of the most important gifts you can give./uni00A0When we talk about our commitment to commu- nity, she planted the seeds, passing along her Irish ancestors' motto: \"Ours is to share.\" When we say that some of our unique Crew bene ts, like Birthday Bonus Pay and Vitamin Bucks, are inspired by things she used to do, these aren't just things we say. They come from an authentic place, from a woman who led with her heart, who was always herself\u2014 compassionate, innovative, wise, and lled with love for all people and the planet. She's the reason we're willing to get a little more personal now and then, in a letter like this, because everybody deserves to know someone like Margaret./uni00A0People felt they mattered; that was the message she always expressed. What you do matters, who you are matters. You are worthy of love and belonging. To the Margarets in all our lives... Happy March!

Try adding a delicious flavor-packed sauce to spruce up almost anything on the menu\u2014without adding much extra time to your night. Chimichurri is delicious on chicken, fish, steak, tempeh, tofu, beans, or vegetables. It can be used as a marinade before cooking or served on top after cooking. Use parsley pesto the same way; it is also tasty on spaghetti squash, pasta, potatoes, and rice. Bring new life to your tired weeknight meals and impress your family with a fresh and zesty good4u SM sauce! 1. For the chimichurri: Add the parsley and cilantro to a food processor and process until finely chopped, about 1 minute. Add the remaining ingredients and process until all the ingredients are finely chopped and well combined. Taste and adjust the flavor to your liking. Chimichurri is easy to adjust to your taste: Add more red pepper, garlic, or salt if you like, if you don't like cilantro, simply leave it out. The outcome should be a fresh flavor, with a little spice and zing. When the taste is to your liking, scrape it into a bowl to use immediately, or transfer to a jar with a tight-fitting lid to refrigerate until ready to use.2. For the parsley pesto: Add the garlic, parsley, walnuts, and cheese to food processor. Process until a paste forms, stopping to scrape down once or twice while processing. Add the olive oil, pouring very slowly, while the food processor runs, to gradually blend the oil into the parsley mixture; adjust the amount to your preference for thickness. Once incorporated, stop to add salt and pepper to taste and process again until well combined. When the taste is to your liking, scrape it into a bowl to use immediately, or transfer to a jar with a tight-fitting lid to refrigerate until ready to use.INGREDIENTS For the chimichurri sauce \u00bd cup organic parsley leaves, stems removed 2 tablespoons organic cilantro leaves, stems removed (optional) \u00bd cup Natural Grocers Brand Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil 2 tablespoons Natural Grocers Brand Organic Apple Cider Vinegar \u00bc - \u00bd small organic red onion, chopped into 1-inch pieces 3 cloves organic garlic \u00bd teaspoon Natural Grocers Brand Bulk Organic Red Chili Flakes (or to taste) \u00be teaspoon Natural Grocers Brand Bulk Organic Oregano Lea f \u00bd - 1 teaspoon coarse salt (adjust to taste) 1 tablespoon water For the parsley pesto sauce 2 organic garlic cloves 2 cups packed, de-stemmed organic Italian parsley \u00bd cup Natural Grocers Brand Bulk Walnuts \u00bd cup finely grated organic Parmesan cheese 1/3- 3/4 cup Natural Grocers Brand Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil Natural Grocers Brand Bulk Real Salt and Organic Ground Black Pepper, to tast ePREP TIME: 15 MINUTES PER SAUCE | 30 MINUTES FOR BOTH SAUCES | SERVES 4INSTRUCTIONS CHIMICHURRI AND PARSLEY PESTO SAUCES ORGANIC HEADQUARTERS\u00ae CULINARY HERBSFOR THE LOVE OF ORGANICS: By Charity Isely References available upon request.WE'LL GO TO THE \"END OF THE WORLD\" FOR PARSLEY Let's head way down south, to Patagonia, and on the way stop by an asado, the South American version of a barbecue.

THE AGE OF ANXIETY & NATURAL SOLUTIONS TO CULTIVATE CALM BY LINDSAY WILSON Natural Grocers | 11 WE ARE A NATION RIDDLED WITH ANXIETY . Whether you su er from generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder (or a combination of any of the above), you are not alone. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S. and a ect 40 million adults, or close to 20 percent of the population,i with millennials and people of color reporting the most anxiety overall and baby boomers reporting the sharpest increases in anxiety.ii Americans' anxiety levels are increasing, but the good news is that anxiety (and mental illness in general) is losing its stigma and has become a tarending topic in the national conversation. Though that is encouraging, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, only about 37 percent of those with anxiety receive treatment. So while there may be more awareness, many people continue to su er. Anxiety can be overwhelming and hard to know how to handle, but it can be controlled. While there are multiple causes of anxiety, and severe anxiety disorders may require medical treatment, many anxiety symptoms can be controlled with lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, meditation, etc.) and by supporting your body and brain with nutritional supplementation.LONG/hyphen.caseTERM: BUILD A FOUNDATION TO CULTIVATE CALM Our modern diets full of processed foods high in sugar and low in saturated fats have left many of us overfed, yet undernourished and mentally unbalanced. We are unknowingly plagued with sub-optimal levels (in some cases, outright de ciencies) of essential vitamins and minerals, some of which play crucial roles in mental health. Start by building optimal levels of these nutrients: Magnesium. Known as a calming mineral, much of the population consumes inadequate amounts of magnesium. Mental and emotional stresses quickly deplete levels, as do poor eating habits, alcohol consumption, and certain prescription drugs. Sometimes called the original \"chill pill,\" magnesium plays important roles in the nervous system, including modulating the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (our central stress response system) and blocking excitatory transmission in brain cells, both of which help prevent feelings of anxiety. Research has shown that increasing magnesium levels results in anti-anxiety e ects and can relieve mild to moderate anxiety and anxiety associated with PMS, especially when combined with vitamin B6.iii iv Studies have used 250-300 mg of magnesium along with 50 mg of vitamin B6 daily with e cacy. Speaking of B vitamins, it's a good idea to take a quality B-complex as a foundational supplement. The B-family works synergistically and is vital for mental and emotional wellbeing; the B vitamins are involved in healthy neurotransmitter production, a healthy stress response, and are necessary for normal central nervous system function.v vi vii viii Stress, sugar, and alcohol all quickly deplete levels of the B vitamins. And because they are water soluble, they are not stored in the body and must be replenished daily.References available upon request. Omega-3 fats. The omega-3 fats docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are essential for healthy neurological function. And like magnesium, many of us are woefully low in these important fats, and instead consume an overabundance of pro- infl ammatory omega-6s. Clinical research has shown that subjects diagnosed with anxiety have signi cantly lower levels of EPA and DHA and a higher ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s in the brain, and at least one trial has shown a correlation between low levels of EPA and severity of PTSD.ix An analysis of 19 clinical trials published late last year examined the anti-anxiety e ects of EPA and DHA in patients with signi cant anxiety and fear-related symptoms. Researchers found that taking between 1,000 and 2,000 mg of combined EPA and DHA daily was associated with an improvement in anxiety symptoms, with the strongest e ect seen in patients with speci c clinical diagnoses.x Rhodiola. This herb has a long history of use as an adaptogen, a substance that enhances the body's resistance to the negative e ects of stress, both physical and mental. Modern research has found that rhodiola can improve symptoms of burnout\u2014feelings of overload, tension, fatigue, and overall stress\u2014all of which can heighten anxiety, and mild generalized anxiety. In one study, 118 patients with burnout took 200 mg of rhodiola twice a day for three months and experienced \"clear improvement,\" with some symptoms improving after just one week of supplementing. Overall, rhodiola led to improvements in fatigue, emotional exhaustion, mood, cognition, and decision making.xi In a trial investigating rhodiola's e ect on people with mild anxiety, supplementing with 200 mg of rhodiola twice daily led to a \"signi cant reduction in self-reported anxiety, stress, anger, confusion, and depression at 14 days and a signi cant improvement in total mood.\" Another small study found that supplementing with 360 mg of rhodiola daily for 10 weeks led to a signi cant improvement in symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder.xii xiii Probiotics. With more information emerging on the gut-brain axis, researchers have begun to delve into the connection between gut health and mental health, with exciting ndings. For example, a healthy balance of Bi dobacterium and Lactobacillus species in the gut is important for producing the brain's main calming neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA); low levels of GABA have been linked to anxiety. Research has also found that probiotics normalize cortisol levels, regulate the HPA axis (hyperactivity or dysregulation of the HPA axis is a strong marker of anxiety), and reduce systemic pro- infl ammatory cytokines, which have been found to play a role in the development of anxiety.xiv Many people have an unhealthy balance of bacteria in their guts, or dysbiosis; restoring a healthy balance is especially crucial for those with anxiety.SHORT/hyphen.caseTERM: RESTORE CALM Long-term support is vital, but when you feel yourself on the edge and need something to restore calm, consider some of these \"in-the- moment\" remedies: The amino acid L-theanine enhances alpha brain wave activity, which induces feelings of calm, and increases the synthesis of the calming neurotransmitter GABA. L-theanine has been shown to lead to changes in brain activity similar to that of meditation. A calming e ect is usually felt within 30 minutes at doses between 50 and 200 mg. For more severe anxiety, doses may be increased up to 800 mg daily, divided throughout the day.xv Passionfl ower has long been used as a folk remedy to treat \"hysteria\" (i.e., anxiety) and insomnia, and modern research is con rming its e cacy.xvi One study including 36 patients diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder found that 45 drops of a liquid passionfl ower extract was as e ective as 30mg of oxazepam, a common anti- anxiety prescription drug, and without the side e ects reported by those taking the drug.xvii This herb may be especially helpful for those whose anxiety is coupled with insomnia. Flower essences are infusions made from the fl owering parts of plants and are used for their bene cial e ects on mood and emotions. They are said to work on a subtle energetic level, but with profound results. One study including moderately anxious subjects who reported personality traits as anxious, impatient, irritable, nervous, and tense, found a 100 percent reduction in anxiety levels after treatment with a blend of impatiens, cherry plum, white chestnut, and beech fl ower essences. Eighty percent of the subjects taking fl ower essences reported that even when confronted with stressful events, they were able to stay calm.xviii Anxiety is a normal human emotion, but one that should pass. When you begin to feel like it has a grip on your life, it's time to address it. Consider taking a holistic approach that includes nutritional supplementation that can support your body and brain to cultivate calm. ANXIETY DISORDERS are the most common mental illness in the U.S. and a ect 40 million adults 12 | Health Hotline\u00ae References available upon request. Omega-3 fats. The omega-3 fats docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are essential for healthy neurological function. And like magnesium, many of us are woefully low in these important fats, and instead consume an overabundance of pro- infl ammatory omega-6s. Clinical research has shown that subjects diagnosed with anxiety have signi cantly lower levels of EPA and DHA and a higher ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s in the brain, and at least one trial has shown a correlation between low levels of EPA and severity of PTSD.ix An analysis of 19 clinical trials published late last year examined the anti-anxiety e ects of EPA and DHA in patients with signi cant anxiety and fear-related symptoms. Researchers found that taking between 1,000 and 2,000 mg of combined EPA and DHA daily was associated with an improvement in anxiety symptoms, with the strongest e ect seen in patients with speci c clinical diagnoses.x Rhodiola. This herb has a long history of use as an adaptogen, a substance that enhances the body's resistance to the negative e ects of stress, both physical and mental. Modern research has found that rhodiola can improve symptoms of burnout\u2014feelings of overload, tension, fatigue, and overall stress\u2014all of which can heighten anxiety, and mild generalized anxiety. In one study, 118 patients with burnout took 200 mg of rhodiola twice a day for three months and experienced \"clear improvement,\" with some symptoms improving after just one week of supplementing. Overall, rhodiola led to improvements in fatigue, emotional exhaustion, mood, cognition, and decision making.xi In a trial investigating rhodiola's e ect on people with mild anxiety, supplementing with 200 mg of rhodiola twice daily led to a \"signi cant reduction in self-reported anxiety, stress, anger, confusion, and depression at 14 days and a signi cant improvement in total mood.\" Another small study found that supplementing with 360 mg of rhodiola daily for 10 weeks led to a signi cant improvement in symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder.xii xiii Probiotics. With more information emerging on the gut-brain axis, researchers have begun to delve into the connection between gut health and mental health, with exciting ndings. For example, a healthy balance of Bi dobacterium and Lactobacillus species in the gut is important for producing the brain's main calming neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA); low levels of GABA have been linked to anxiety. Research has also found that probiotics normalize cortisol levels, regulate the HPA axis (hyperactivity or dysregulation of the HPA axis is a strong marker of anxiety), and reduce systemic pro- infl ammatory cytokines, which have been found to play a role in the development of anxiety.xiv Many people have an unhealthy balance of bacteria in their guts, or dysbiosis; restoring a healthy balance is especially crucial for those with anxiety.SHORT/hyphen.caseTERM: RESTORE CALM Long-term support is vital, but when you feel yourself on the edge and need something to restore calm, consider some of these \"in-the- moment\" remedies: The amino acid L-theanine enhances alpha brain wave activity, which induces feelings of calm, and increases the synthesis of the calming neurotransmitter GABA. L-theanine has been shown to lead to changes in brain activity similar to that of meditation. A calming e ect is usually felt within 30 minutes at doses between 50 and 200 mg. For more severe anxiety, doses may be increased up to 800 mg daily, divided throughout the day.xv Passionfl ower has long been used as a folk remedy to treat \"hysteria\" (i.e., anxiety) and insomnia, and modern research is con rming its e cacy.xvi One study including 36 patients diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder found that 45 drops of a liquid passionfl ower extract was as e ective as 30mg of oxazepam, a common anti- anxiety prescription drug, and without the side e ects reported by those taking the drug.xvii This herb may be especially helpful for those whose anxiety is coupled with insomnia. Flower essences are infusions made from the fl owering parts of plants and are used for their bene cial e ects on mood and emotions. They are said to work on a subtle energetic level, but with profound results. One study including moderately anxious subjects who reported personality traits as anxious, impatient, irritable, nervous, and tense, found a 100 percent reduction in anxiety levels after treatment with a blend of impatiens, cherry plum, white chestnut, and beech fl ower essences. Eighty percent of the subjects taking fl ower essences reported that even when confronted with stressful events, they were able to stay calm.xviii Anxiety is a normal human emotion, but one that should pass. When you begin to feel like it has a grip on your life, it's time to address it. Consider taking a holistic approach that includes nutritional supplementation that can support your body and brain to cultivate calm.

The global adoption of regenerative agricultural practices on both grassland and cropland could sequester more than 100 percent of current, human-caused CO2 emissions. 1 These are the ndings of the latest Rodale Institute report, Regenerative Agriculture and the Soil Carbon Solution, which includes peer-reviewed research/uni00A0 and the observations of seasoned agronomists, and data from Rodale's Farming Systems Trial, North America's longest-running side-by-side comparison of organic and conventional grain cropping systems.i 2 \"Regenerative agriculture is a system of farming principles that rehabilitates the entire ecosystem and enhances natural resources, rather than depleting them.\"3/uni00A0Its practices improve soil health by increasing soil organic matter, of which biodiversity, both above and below ground, is a critical component. 4 It enhances soil's water retention capacity, improves its structure, and enables carbon sequestration at greater depths.5 Some of the regenerative practices identi ed in the report that support soil carbon sequestration include: diversifying crop rotations, planting cover crops, using natural sources of fertilizer such as compost, eliminating synthetic chemicals, and employing highly managed grazing. \"These interlinked practices support soil life and minimize erosion by retaining biomass from a wide variety of living and dead roots, shoots, and microbes, which work together to sequester carbon.\"iv The evidence is in the data.

Here are some of our favorites: ROAST 'EM Roast a large batch of vegetables to keep in the refrigerator for easy access through the week\u2014try sweet potatoes, beets, carrots, caulifl ower, and/or broccoli. Warm or cold, roasted veggies are delicious additions to salads and grain bowls, served with fried or scrambled eggs for a quick breakfast, or eaten as a simple side. (Try our Organic Rainbow Roasted Veggie Bowl recipe on page 41!) Prep 'EM A little prep goes a long way. Choose three or four of your favorite veggies to eat raw (think cucumber, sweet peppers, radishes, carrots), cut them up and divide them among small storage containers that are easy to bring on the go. Think outside the le/t_t.liga uce box Aim to eat at least one large salad with a variety of veggie toppings every day. And while we're talking salads, think outside of the lettuce box: try shredded cabbage topped with mint, cilantro, peppers, and cashews; chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, and fresh herbs; or thinly shaved fennel topped with slices of your favorite citrus fruit. There are many ways to eat salad, and it doesn't always have to include lettuce. pi/z_z.liga a - oh yeah! Love pizza? Load it up with veggie toppings and after it has baked, add a heaping pile of arugula tossed in lemon juice and olive oil on top. Better yet, substitute your regular pizza crust for a caulifl ower one! ferment 'em Keep your fridge stocked with sauerkraut and other fermented vegetables\u2014they make easy, no-prep sides and snacks and are great toppings for sandwiches, wraps, and salads. Blend 'em Toss a handful or two of baby spinach, frozen caulifl ower, or frozen zucchini into your smoothie\u2014once it's blended, you'll never know it's there. Roasted beets are also a fun addition to smoothies, adding a touch of sweetness and vibrant color. Soup's on Soups and stews are excellent places to load up on veggies. Most start with a base of saut\u00e9ed onion and garlic, and it's easy to add extra veggies from there; think celery, carrots, potatoes, sweet peppers, green beans, zucchini, and greens like kale or collards. DIP 'EM Sometimes a good sauce or dip is the key. Try bu alo sauce drizzled on roasted caulifl ower, marinara dolloped over saut\u00e9ed zucchini eggplant, your favorite salad dressings repurposed as a veggie dressing (chopped celery mixed with blue cheese is a favorite), or pesto and hummus for raw-veggie dipping. Hide 'em \"Hide\" veggies like chopped spinach, kale, shredded carrots, shredded zucchini, or nely minced mushrooms in meatloaf, taco meat, burgers, or spaghetti sauce. Serve 'em Serve any type of entr\u00e9e (chicken, steak, pork, sh, tofu, tempeh) over a big bed of greens lightly dressed with a dressing of your choice. Stock up Keep your pantry and freezer stocked with canned and frozen veggies so you'll always have a quick and easy option on hand; just heat, season with sea salt and pepper, and add a healthy fat like grass-fed butter or coconut oil. swap 'em Swap out your re ned carbs for veggies; try zucchini noodles (\"zoodles\") and spaghetti squash instead of pasta, and caulifl ower \"rice\" instead of white rice. breakfast time Don't forget about veggies at breakfast! Try saut\u00e9ed vegetables with eggs, nely shredded carrot and/or zucchini in pancakes or oatmeal, or even your favorite veggie-loaded lunch or dinner as your rst meal of the day. explore 'em Explore new recipes.

Preheat oven to 400 F. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper and prep the sweet potatoes, potatoes, carrots, beet, and radishes. 2. Spread the sweet potatoes, potatoes, carrots, beets, and radishes onto the baking sheets. Drizzle with 2-3 tablespoons melted coconut oil and season with 1 teaspoon curry powder and salt to taste. Place in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove each tray, one at a time, to turn the vegetables. Place back in the oven to roast for an additional 5-10 minutes. 3. While the vegetables roast, prep the red pepper, broccoli, and kale. In a mixing bowl, toss the red pepper and broccoli with 1 tablespoon melted coconut oil and season with \u00bd teaspoon curry powder and salt to taste. 4. After the root vegetables have roasted for 20-25 minutes (and are beginning to soften and brown), add the red pepper and broccoli to either baking sheet. Roast for 10 more minutes. 5. In the same bowl used for the red pepper and broccoli, toss the kale with the remaining coconut oil and curry powder. 6. In the last 5 minutes of roasting (when the vegetables are almost ready to serve), add the kale to either pan and roast until tender and bright green. 7. Stir together all dressing ingredients, except for the water, in a small bowl until smooth and creamy. Add 2 tablespoons water and stir to combine; if the consistency is too thick add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is achieved. 8. To serve, divide vegetables among serving plates or bowls, drizzle with the tahini dressing, and add a protein or additional toppings if desired.INGREDIENTS 1 medium organic sweet potato, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds 2 medium organic Yukon Gold potatoes, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds 2 medium or 1 large organic carrot, ends removed, thinly sliced 1 medium organic beet, ends removed, sliced into 1/8-inch rounds 6-8 medium organic radishes, halved or quartered 4 tablespoons organic coconut oil, melted and divided 2 teaspoons Natural Grocers Brand Bulk Organic Curry Powder, divided Natural Grocers Brand Bulk Real Salt, to taste 1 medium organic red pepper, core removed, thinly sliced 1 cup organic broccoli florets 2-2 \u00bd cups thinly sliced organic kale with the stems removed Dressing \u00bc cup organic sesame tahini 3 tablespoons Natural Grocers Brand Organic Apple Cider Vinegar 2 tablespoons organic tamari or coconut aminos 1 small organic garlic clove, minced 2-6 tablespoons water Natural Grocers Brand Bulk Real Salt, to taste Optional for topping Sliced protein (chicken, steak, tofu, or tempeh), sliced avocado, sesame seeds or hemp seedsPREP TIME: 30 MINUTES | COOK TIME: 40-45 MINUTES TOTAL TIME: 1 HOUR | SERVES 3-4INSTRUCTIONS ORGANIC ROASTED VEGGIE BOWL WITH SESAME TAHINI DRESSING Natural Grocers | 41 IN THE fridgeIN THE fridge OFFERS VALID FEBRUARY 26 TO MARCH 27, 2021OFFERS VALID FEBRUARY 26 TO MARCH 27, 2021 ALWAYS AFFORDABLESM $1.79FORAGER PROJECT\u00ae Organic Cashewmilk Yogurt 5.3 OZ.

For instance, while many often turn to sugary foods to provide a quick pick-me-up and mood boost, recent studies indicate that this strategy can actually worsen mood. And it doesn't take long for the e ects to be seen, according to one recent meta-analysis. In this study, researchers analyzed data from 31 randomized- controlled trials to examine the acute e ects of eating re ned sugars on mood in healthy adults. Results revealed that within just one hour of consuming re ned sugars, participants experienced detrimental e ects on mental health, including signi cant decreases in alertness and energy levels. A number of previous studies have established a link between diets high in sugar and depression.The good news, research also shows that cleaning up your diet and eating healthier can positively impact mood, and quickly too! In one 2019 study, young adults with depression symptoms were asked to decrease their intake of processed food and sugar (particularly from re ned carbohydrates and soft drinks) and switch to a Mediterranean-style diet. This included eating ve servings of vegetables per day, two to three servings of fruit, and increasing their intake of other health-promoting foods like sh, nuts and seeds, olive oil, and spices like turmeric and cinnamon. After just three weeks of changing their diet, participants reported signi cant improvements in depression symptoms and lower levels of anxiety and stress.

Researchers in Budapest, Hungary conducted a double-blind placebo- controlled study to examine the e ects of echinacea on anxiety scores for 62 adults with elevated anxiety. The subjects took one tablet of echinacea, containing 40 mg of echinacea extract, daily for seven days. The patients' anxiety scores were tracked for an additional three weeks after the treatment was discontinued. Participants taking the echinacea extract showed signi cant improvements in anxiety scores compared to those taking the placebo after the seven-day treatment period. More surprisingly, these bene ts remained persistent in the three weeks after they had stopped the echinacea treatment. The researchers acknowledged that echinacea is not a replacement for anxiety medication, but may o er another tool for people with mild anxiety. This study adds to the body of research highlighting the connection between the brain and immune system and may lead to further research examining the e ects of what has been traditionally thought as immune supportive supplements for both cognitive function and mood. 46 | Health Hotline\u00ae NEW PRODUCTSNEW PRODUCTS OF THE MONTHOFFERS VALID FEBRUARY 26 TO MARCH 27, 2021 $129933% OFF ALWAYS AFFORDABLE $19.49TENDER & TRUE\u00ae Organic Chicken Recipe Dry Dog Food 4 LB The small breed recipe is perfectly formulated and made into bite size pieces for even the smallest of canine companions!
