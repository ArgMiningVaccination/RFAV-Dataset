I have visited ma ny of the Trust services o ver the last year and, without exception, I have been impressed by the commitment and pride that staff have sho wn in th eir work and in providing the very highest standards of patient care. The dedication which staff have demonstrated has made me very proud to be the Chairman of Dorset HealthCare. The Trust has continued to focus on further improving the quality of our services and pat ient outcom es. Our most important objective is the quality of care that we pro vide. The Trust has continued to make a considerable investment in service quality and the infrastructure of the organisation and this resulted in some of our services be ing rec ognised nationally. I am particularly pleased with the progress made in implement ing the o utcome of the Mental Health Acute Care Pathway Review. I am delighted with the progress that we have made in delivering our quality priorities for the year. Chapter 3 of the report provides much more detail on o ur achievements in this area. I am pleased with the continued improvement we are making as reflected in the national staff survey results. The results in 201 8/19 placed us third nat ionally in the group of similar trusts. More widely, the Trust has cont inued to play a full part as a partner in the nationally recognised Dorset Integrated Care System. Considerable progress has been made by partners on how we can work together for the benefit of Dorset residents. Looking forward to 201 9/20, whilst the comi ng year will no d oubt bring us many challenges, together with the Board I am excited by the opportunity to set a new strategy for the Trust, by the prospect of ever better integration of our services in local hubs in the County and by joint working with our partners in Dorset to deliver better health outcomes for Dorset residents. I would like to thank all our staff, volunteers, partners and the many other organisations and individuals who we work with for their contribution in making 201 8/19 a successful year for the Trust. Andy Willis Chairman 8 Who We Are Dorset HealthCare is the principal provider of commu nity and mental health ser vices a cross Dorset. We serve a population of almost 800,000 peo ple, employing around 5,000 staff covering a range of expertise and specialisms. The Trust's income is ap proximate ly \u00a3266 million. The Trust has a large and geographically spread estate, providing services from over 300 sites ranging from village halls and GP s urgeries to small, medium-sized mental health in- patient hospitals to single ward community hospitals located in market towns. The services provided by the Trust are diverse and con stantly evolving to meet the ch anging needs of the local population. We run Dorset's 12 community hospitals and minor injuries un its - as well as pro viding adult and children's commu nity and mental health services, specialist learning disability services, community brain injury services. Our commu nity health services encompas s: district nurses, health visitors, sch ool nursing, end of life care, sexual health promotion, safeguarding ch ildren, diabetes education, audiology, speech and language therapy, dermatology, podiatry, orthopaedic services, wheelchair services, anti-coagulation services, pulmonary rehab, early discharge stroke services, Parkinson's services, community oncology and breastfeeding support ser vices. Dorset HealthCare became a Foundation Trust on 1st April 2007. We are regulated by NHS Improvement which auth orises and regulates NHS Foundation Trusts and supports their development, ensuring they are well-governed and financially robust. The arrangements by which the Trust is governed are reviewed in sec tion 2.1 of this Report. Our Achievements in 2018/19 The Trust has continued to invest in services o ver the course of the year. In this section we highlight some of these achievements. During the year we have cont inued to invest in new facilities for patients and st aff including: Douglas House A \u00a31.36 million pound investment to relocate services from the Seastone building on the Alumhurst Road site to Douglas ho use has been completed. The ground floor Child and Adolescent Mental Health team will benefit from a new sensory room, clinical consulting rooms and conference facilities. A mixture of individual and open p lan office spaces will accommodate Health visitors and District nurses. The building is the first of its kind to benefit from the installation of a photo voltaic system generating up to 20kw of free e lectricity. LED lighting has been installed throughout, together with a state of the art heating system with intelligent controls that can be accessed remotely. Hillcrest Part of the Hillcrest site has und ergone a comp lete transformation to ena ble the Early Intervention team to relocate from Alumhurst Road. New offices, staff meeting room and welfare facilities ha ve been pro vided together with ene rgy efficient lighting and he ating. 9 Improved Radiology Services at Swanage Hospital Construction works commenced in January 2019 to refurbish the X-ray department at Swanage Hospital. New digital X- ray equipment is being installed together with a comp lete refurbishme nt of existing clinical spaces, ultrasound ro om, along with a private changing facility. Weymouth Hospital A \u00a3650k project to upgrade the t hree ventilation systems and cooling system to Weymouth Hospital is nearing com pletion. The design has addressed previous issues of poor environmental conditions and overheati ng. A new building management system has been integrated into the project to allow more accurate control of the space temperature together with hygienic cleaning of all ductwork. In summary, it has been a succes sful year for the Trust with the quality of services, patient outcom es and patient experience im proving, and the o perational financial performance of the organisation rema ining strong. Other service highlights during the year included: joining forces with The Patients Association to carry out a study aimed at giving a better unde rstanding of how it feels to be a patient using mental health services; a visit from Japanese health professionals who travelled th ousands of miles to see a pioneering Dorset initiative which pro vides education and training for people affected by mental health problems; Patients and staff at Alderney Hospital enjoying tasty, nutritious meals full of locally- sourced ingredients thanks to a joint initiative between Trust staff and students at Bournemouth University; The designation of Weymouth Community Hospital as one of the first 150 NHS Urgent Treatment Centres (UTCs) operating across the country; The award of Disability Confident Employer status to the Trust, showing a commitment to impro ving the way it attracts, recruits and supports people with a disability; A national award for a series of popular podcasts which explore the emotional and physical health pro blems faced by young people in Dorset and across the country; The award of Gold Standard Frame work (GSF) accreditation to two Trust wards at Alderney Hospital in Poole for their work in helping elderly dementia patients spend their final days in dignity and peac e. The award-to Herm a nd St. Brelades wards- are the first elderly care mental health un its in the country to earn the status; The award of an MBE to Andy Gritt, who leads Dorset HealthCare's Armed F orces Community Health and Wellbeing Team in the New Years' Honours List; The Armed F orces C ommunity Health and Wellbeing Team winning the national award for mental health in the NHS70 Parliamen tary Awards 10 The ranking of the Trust, in the Care Quality Commission's national Community Mental Health Sur vey, as one of the top four NHS trusts in the co untry in providing an extreme ly high level of care for people with mental illness; The Trust Criminal Justice and L iaison Service winning the n ational mental health award at the Health Service Journ al Patient Safety Awards; The estab lishme nt of a dedicated te am of community support to provide short term care to frail and vulnerable peo ple living in the most remote parts of North Dorset; Being awarded \u00a37 5,000 from a national fund to help lead a nat ional drive to develop volunteering programmes in supp ort of the NHS. Dorset HealthCare was one of just 12 trusts selected to take part, and will receive funding from NHS England to ena ble local volunteers to play a bigger part in end -of-life care. Our Performance in 2018/19 This section of the report explains how the Trust has pe rformed against key national and local targets in each of our main ser vice areas. Mental Health & L earning Disability Servic es The National Planning guidance for 2018/19 focussed on the delivery of a number of Mental Health targets: Estimated Diagnosis rate for people with Dementia Improving access to ps ychological therapies (IAPT) Roll out IAPT Recovery Rate IAPT Waiting Times - 6 Weeks IAPT Waiting Times - 18 Weeks Psychosis treated with a National Inst itute for Health and C are Excellence (NICE) approved package within two weeks of referral Improving Access Rate to Children & Young People's Mental Health Ser vices The proportion of children a nd young people with estimated diagnosis (routine cases) that wait four weeks or less from referral to start of NICE approved treatment The proportion of children a nd young people with estim ated d iagnosis (Urgent cases) that wait one week or less from referral to start of NICE approved treatment Out of Area Placements The Trust performed well against the agreed performance trajectories des pite increases in demand. Year on year there has been an increase in referrals and contacts across all areas of mental health, learning disability and Steps to Wellbeing Services: 11 Despite the continued growth, access and waiting time indicators have been met for nearly all services. Detailed plans are in place to ad dress access waiting times for those services where targets were not met- Children & Young People's Mental Health Ser vices and Adult Eating Disorder Services. Estimated Dementia Diagnosis rate for people aged 65+ The national thresho ld for the e stimated d iagnosis rate for people with de mentia is 6 6.7%. During 2017/18 & 2018/19 Dorset has consistently averaged 61% compliance. This is a target for the whole hea lthcare system in Dorset. As at February 2019, Dorset has the 5 highest dementia diagnosis rate in the South West Region: IAPT Roll Out, IAPT Recovery Rate, IAPT Waiting Times - Six Weeks & IAPT Waiting Times - 18 Weeks The IAPT service is co ntinuing to e xpand to meet growing demand. The ser vice saw 97% of patients within the six week target (against a nat ional target of 75%) and all patients within 18 weeks (against a target of 95%): 12 The service cont inues to achieve excellent recovery rates and is in the top quartile of performance nationally: Psychosis treated with a NICE approved package within two weeks of referral This measures the n umber of referrals to and within the Trust of patients with susp ected first episode psychosis or \"at risk mental state\", and that start a NICE Rec ommended package of care in the reporting period within 2 weeks of referral. The Trust has consistently met the required threshold month on month for 2018/19. Improving Access Rate to Children & Young People's Mental Health Serv ices The national indicator is designed to measure increases in access to children and young people's mental health services. The indicator aims to ensure at least 35% of children and young people with a diagnosable mental health condition receive treatment from an NHS- funded community mental health service by 20/21. The required target was to achieve 32% in 2018/19 across the Dorset system. The Trust was able to see 30% (3,348 patients) of patients within the target time. (a) The pro portion of children a nd young people with estim ated d iagnosis (Routine case s) that wait four weeks or less from referral to start of NICE approved treatment (b) The prop ortion of children a nd young people with estim ated d iagnosis (Urgent cases) that wait 1 week or less from referral to start of NICE approved treatment Compliance for urgent cases starting treatment within one week of referral has consistently been ac hieved (1 00%) during 18/1 9. Increas ing dema nd has made the ac hievement of the four week target more cha llenging. Recruiting m ore staff resulted in the target being achieved in March 2019 and a plan has been agreed to achieve the target on a consistent basis in 201 9/20: 13 Out of area placements - The Trust is committed to eliminating out of area placements which are n ot in the best interes ts of patients. Plans are in place to achieve a year-on-year reduction. The demand for services has made this challenging to achieve on a cons istent basis. However, the introduction of an additional 16 adult acute mental beds in Dorset by 2020/21 will make a significant contribution: Integrated Community Servic es Referral to Treatment The percentage of patients waiting less than 18 weeks for Consultant-led treatments at each month-end during 2018-19 was abo ve the national target of 92% in each month: 14 Consultant-Led services which contr ibute to this target include: General Surgery Urology Trauma & Orthopaedic Ear Nose & Throat Ophthalmology General Medicine Cardiology Rheumato logy Elderly Medicine Gynaecology Podiatric Surgery Many of these services see re latively small numbers of patients each month. Any individual patients who wait longer than 18 weeks will have a significant impact on the perce ntage. Consultant-led services usually rely on arranging sess ions in our Community Hospitals that utilise Consultants from acute hosp itals on service level agreements. The lower performance from Septemb er to December 2018 was due to shortages of Consultant time in Ophthalmology. Diagnostics The percentage of patients waiting less than six weeks for diagnostics tests at each month- end during 2018/19 was above the national target of 99% in each month: 15 Diagnostics services co nsist Audiology Cardiology Urodynamics Endoscopy Of these services, Audiology and Ultrasound see the most patients. In eight of the 12 months there were no patient breaches. Community Hospital Inpatient Average Len gth of Stay and Delayed Transfers of Care (DTOC) The 12-month rolling average length of stay for Community Hospital inpatients has reduced consistently during the year from an average 31.4 days in 201 7/18: There are real benefits for patients from a reduced length of stay, both for the individual patient being able to return home e arlier and because m ore patients can receive care in Community Hospitals in a year. Considerable effort that has been made in partnership with Dorset local author ities to reduce delays in discharge of patients from Community Hospitals. This has included se tting expected d ischarge dates early on admission and undertaking regular reviews with pat ients and car ers involving medical, nursing, therapy and soc ial care staff, who all contribute to the progress of the patient to a safe discharge: 16 The percentage of days lost to de layed transfers of care in 2 018/19 averaged 10.9% compared to 15.7% in 2017/18.The Trust has implemented a number of initiatives to improve flow through Commu nity Hospitals based on good practice guidance issued by NHS Improvemen t. Children, young people and Families se rvices Children a nd their families are supported by a number of Trust services with an emphas is on giving children the best start in life. The Health Visiting ser vice de livers a universal programme of visits which are available to all children a nd the service co nsistently exceeds the South West average performance achievement. Health Visiting Service mandated v isits This support is continued by the DHC School Nursing te am when a child reaches school age, which includes de livery of immu nisations. In the mo st recently comp leted pr ogramme the Trust exceeded NHS England's minimum threshold target for delivering the flu vaccine, and exceeded the South West uptake rates: Source: NHS England Effective supp ort is also provided to Looked after Children (L AC) and performance in delivering regular reviews for all children on the L AC cas eload. For these reviews performance was at or above target by the end of the year, providing assurance that all children on the L AC caseload receive regular monitoring and checks. 17 Looked after Children p erformance compared to target Sustainability Report Sustainability has become increasingly important in all aspects of life, helping to reduce harmful impacts on our own env ironment and reducing the economic impact of high energy costs. The impact of what we do affect people and the Trust acknowledges the responsibility to patients, staff, local commu nity and environment by striving to reduce its carbon footprint. As part of the local NHS, public health and social care framework, and as a spen der of public funds, the Trust has an obligation to work in a way that has a positive effect on the community. Sustainability enables the d elivery of the Trust carbon reduction commitments and con tributes to the ambitious targets to reduce the NHS and Soc ial Care carbon emiss ions by 34% from a 1990 b aseline by 2020. Demons trating that the Trust co nsiders the social and environmental impacts ensures that the legal requireme nts in the Public Services (Social Value) Act (2012) are met. In order to fulfil these responsibilities the Trust has a Board ap proved Sustainable Development Management Plan (SDMP). The Trust also comp leted the Sustainability Development Assessment Tool (SDAT) in Autumn 2018. The SDAT is a self-assessment tool to he lp organisations understand their susta inable development work, me asure progress and help make plans for the future. It uses four cross cutting themes 'Governance and Policy', 'Core responsibilities', 'Procurement and Supply chain' and 'Working with Staff, Patients & Communities'. The tool provides an overall score, as a percentage, which the Trust will use as a baseline for subsequent assessme nts and to benchmark against other organisations. The Trust score in 201 8/19 was 36%. The Trust arranges running awareness c ampaigns that promote the benefits of sustainability to our staff. Examples this year included \"Turn it Off\" and the Warp It reuse and recycle portal. Climate change brings new challenges to our business both in direct effects to the healthcare estates, but also to patient health. Examples of recent years include the effects of heat waves, extreme temperatures and prolonged per iods of cold, floods, droughts etc. The Trust se eks to develop ef fective measures to ad dress and adapt the d elivery of the 18 Carbon (tCO2e) organisation's activities and infrastructure to meet climate change and adverse weather events. During 2018 the Trust responded to two extreme weather events in the form of \"Storm Emma\" and the \"Beast from the East\" followed sh ortly after by a heatwave. Summer 2018 was the joint hottest summer for UK and the joint hottest summer on record for the UK as a whole, and the h ottest ever for England temperature highs experienced were tied with those of 1976, 2003 and 2006 for being the h ighest since records began in 1910 The Trust is proud of its cook fresh facilities provided at a n umber of the Community Hospitals. Staff who work within these teams have won awards in regional and National compet itions including the Hospital Caterers Association (HCA) 2019 awards. The awards publicly acknowledge the commitment and contributions from HCA memb ers over the last 12 months. Iain Robertson, Hotel Services Manager at St Ann's Hospital, won the prestigious Hospital Caterers Association \"Chef of the Year\" award. Energy Energy is one of Trust 's largest areas of expenditure. The ch art below shows the CO2 emiss ions from our energy usage over the last four financial years. It is positive to see a downward trend desp ite the co ld spell in Spr ing 2018 followed by the Summer 2018 heatwave. These temperature extremes inevitably cause great er energy usage. 10,000 8,000 6,000 4,000 2,000 0 Carbon Emis sions - Ener gy Use 2015/16 2016/17 2017/18 2018/19 Gas Electricity The chart below shows energy consumption over the last four years. The energy costs increased in 201 8/2019. Further energy cost rises will be experienced in forthcoming years due to the abolition of the Carbon Reduction Credit (CRC ) scheme and its replacement by Climate Change Levy (CCL) which will be a pplied to each un it of energy purchased. Electricity consumption has reduced and Gas consumpt ion increased in the last year. This resulted in a Total Energy CO2 em ission increase over previous years. Over the last four years the Trust has experienced a 20% Total Energy CO2 emission reduction. 1,773,338 19 The work undertaken at the largest 13 Trust sites (in the main the Community Hospitals) to reduce e nergy consumption is now paying off and demonstrated in these figures. In addition, the new Building Environmental Management System (BEMS) being ro lled out at a number of sites is giving grea ter control of energy usage. The boiler plant replacement schemes commenced a few years ago must also be factored into these reductions. The new equipment is more compact, us es less en ergy and is cl eaner and more efficient. In early 2019 the Trust opened a refurbished building called Seascape House. This is fitted with a Solar PV array which will generate 240 47kWh of electricity per annum avoiding electricity needing to be purchased from grid and will be co nsumed by users of the b uilding. A carbon saving of over 7 tonnes per annum will be ma de by this initiative. During 2019 the Trust intends to install Solar PV to 4 sites which will create an a nnual power generation of 182,535 kWh of electricity. An annual carbon saving of 51 tonnes will be ma de. The power created will be used at the installed sites. This enterprise will reduce the amount the Trust spend on grid energy. Replacement LED light fittings are be ing installed across the Estate as part of Capital works and when light fittings reach the end of life. The LED lights use less energy, emit less he at, are maintena nce free for at least 5 years and provide a better environment due to the light emitted by them. An LED bulb uses 67% less po wer than an equivalent fluorescent bulb. In early 2019 the Trust bid for and was awarded a grant from the n ational NHS Energy Efficiency Fund (NEEF) to install LED lighting across 10 Trust sites. This will lead to ann ual energy savings of \u00a3376k and carb on reductions of 824,000kg/CO 2. Reuse and Recycling The Trust launched the Warp It reuse and recycling portal in autumn 2017 on a pilot basis and this has been very well received. The organisation can n ow access and make use of the portal which is reached by the Intranet. Details of surplus equipment is entered on Warp It with a picture and staff seeking equipment search the system and then claim items needed. This avoids the cost of buying new items, th eir associated raw material, manufacturing and distribution costs. To date nearly \u00a3105,000 has been saved in new items purchase costs, over 43930kg of CO2 emissions saved through manufacturing and distribution of new items, 18068 kg of existing re used items that may have become \"waste\" equipment requiring disposal for which we would have been r equired to pay for to remove. This is the equivalent of planting 66 trees. The Trust now recycles over 53% of its waste and this figure has been growing steadily over the last few years. The waste compounds now in evidence at most of our larger sites have enab led ec onomies of scale that derive greater benefits from recycling m aterial. Waste Just over two years ago the Trust achieved \"Zero to Lan dfill\"-waste is either recycled or sent for disposal and used to create energy. Over 370 tonnes of waste is now recycled representing a 5 3% recycling rate: 20 600.0 es) High Temp disposal (tonn es) Land fill (tonn es) The Trust sends food waste for processing at a local anaerobic digestion facility. The waste food is turned into methane which is con verted into power and sent to the National Grid. The organic material rema ining after the process is made available to local farmers for use in their agricultural processes. The fact this all takes place locally also re duces the travel footprint. Waste Finite Resource Use - Water The Trust has reduced by almost one quarter the water usage over the last four years: Water 2015/16 mileage from staff using their own vehicles and staff commuting, as shown in the ta ble below-is a large part of the Trust carbon Trust is pursuing a ranger of approaches to reduce travel related CO2- a cycle to work scheme, investment in secure bike shelters and the development of an agile working project to reduce staff travel to work and for work. Biodiversity and Green Space As part of the ca pital planning process the Trust gives consideration to creating green and outdoor space for patients and staff. It is recognised as ha ving su bstantial therapeutic and health ben efits which are essential to the h uman recovery process. There are environmental benefits to this also including support to local ecology and flora & fauna. Procurement A Sustainable Proc urement Policy has been developed which raises a wareness amongst suppliers and potential suppliers to the Trust of the susta inable impact of procurement and supply chain Financial Performance One of the key challenges and risks identified for the year was the delivery of the financial plan. The Trust delivered a s urplus of \u00a37.2 million. This was ahe ad of the p lanned deficit of \u00a32.1 million. This performance includes the benefit of receiving \u00a37.9 million of Provider Sustainability Funding. The Trust's financial performance history for the past three years is summarised below: Year Total Income \u00a3m 2016/17 (0.49) Notes: Total Income includes interest received *includes discontinued operations In terms of regulatory financial performance, the finance a nd use of resources theme within NHS Improvement 's Single Oversight Framework is based on the scori ng of five measures from '1' to '4' where '1' reflects the strongest performance. The Trust achieved the h ighest Use of Resources score of 1 throughout the year as set in table below (this is covered in more detail in section 2.5 of this report): 22 2018/19 Metric 01 score 02 score 03 score 04 score Financial sustainability Capital service capacity 1 1 1 1 Liquidity 1 1 1 1 Financial efficiency I&E margin 1 1 1 1 Financial controls Distance from financial plan 1 1 1 1 Agency spend 1 1 1 1 Overall Use of Resources Score 1 1 1 1 The Trust has been fully engaged in preparation for a possible 'no deal' in respect of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. The Trust has implemented a Brexit plan in accordance with the national priorities set out by the Department of Health and Social Care. These cover -supply of medicines and vaccines , supply of medical devices and clinical consumables , supply of non-clinical consumables , goods and services, workforce shortages, reciprocal healthcare , research and clinical trials and data sharing, processing and access. Preparations have also been made on planning for identified local risks Going Concern The progress that the Trust has made and the commitment of our staff gives every confidence that services of high quality will continue to be provided now and into the future . On this basis, after making enquiries , the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Trust has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future . For this reaso n, they continue to adopt the 'going concern ' basis in preparing the accounts . Post Bala nce Sheet Events In the opinion of the Directors of the Trust , there are no Post Balance Sheet events . Signed 22 May 2019 23 2. Accountabi lity Report 2.1 Directors' Report Board of Directors; Compo sition; Committees, Intere sts Board Composition The Board of Directors is responsible for managing the Trust, ensuring delivery of financial performance, quality of services and ensuri ng all standards are achieved and targets are met. The Trust has a unitary Board, comprising the Chair Seven other independent Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) Seven Executive Directors Upon app ointment to the Board of Directors, Board members receive a comprehe nsive induction. Director training is reviewed and und ertaken to ensure the Board is regularly refreshed and Directors update their skills and knowledge. The figure below summarises the formal roles of the Directors as part of a unitary Board and when acting collectively in the Boardroom or undertaking distinctive Executive/Non- Executive roles outs ide of formal meetings: All directors acting collectively as a unitary Board Establish and c ommunicates the values and behaviours underpinning organisational culture. Determ ine the organisation strategy from amongst options provided by the Executive. Allocate resources using budgets. Monitor performance. Hold the Executive to account. Executives / Executive Groups Establish the operational controls by which organisational objectives are met. Hold management to account. NEDs / Non-Executive-led Assurance Committees Using a risk based a pproach, acquire and scruti nise assuranc es that the o perational controls are designed well and operat ing effectively. Directors participate in a variety of activities, such as visits to service are as, and learn abo ut the Trust in multiple ways. This provides content, insight and triangulation of information to support evidence-based decision m aking. The Board meets at least six times per year in formal Board meetings and also undertakes other activities. The Board generally holds its meetings in pub lic but there are some occasions when the public are excluded from a 'Part 2' meeting in which matters of a confidential nature are discuss ed. Regular reports from the Chief Executive and other Executives are provided to ens ure that the Board has an accurate and balanced ass essment of the Trust 's position and progress towards its objecti ves. Workshops are he ld in most mo nths throughout the year to raise Board effectiveness and to discuss the development of strategic opportunities and cha llenges. Non-Executive Directors also meet together from time to time without the Executive Directors prese nt. 24 Careful consideration has been given to the composition of the Board and the experiences required for managing an NHS Foundation Trust. This resulted in spec ific experience, values and comp etencies be ing so ught when appointments were made to the Board during the year. This is to ensure that the Board of Directors is balanced a nd has the skills needed to meet the objectives of the Trust. Currently our Non-Executive Directors have a wide ra nge of experiences including healthcare governanc e; strategy; social care, finance a nd technology, which match the Trust's needs well. The Board regularly assesses its performance and its development needs. During the course of the year the Board commenced a self-assessme nt against the Well-Led Frame work. This will be us ed as a basis for commissioning an external governance re view later in the year and to support an e xterna lly facilitated workshop. The Board establishes an ann ual development programme. This is supported by development plans for individual director s. Board Committees review their performance an nually by way of self-assessme nt against best practice criteria, such as - in the case of the Audit Committee - the toolkit in the NHS Audit Committee Handbook published by the Healthcare Financial Management Association. All of the Trust's Non-Executive Directors are free of any connection to the Trust which might be perceived to be likely to bias their judgement in their roles. The Chair is responsible for the leadership of the Board of Directors and Council of Governor s. He ens ures the effectiveness in a ll aspects of their roles whilst at the same time ensuring they work together effectively and cons tructively. The Chair reports to the Board the views expressed by Governors and by the Council as a whole. The Chair is also responsible for ensuring that both the Board and Council receive accur ate, timely and clear information to enable them to undertake their roles and responsibilities. The Chair has disclosed his other intere sts which cou ld impa ct on his time a vailable to perform the role which requires about three days a week of his time. These are set out, along with those of all Directors, in the register of interests, which app ears later in this chapter. All Directors have signed declarations to abide by the Trust's Code of Conduct for Directors. They have each a lso made declarations as to compliance with NHS' s fit and prop er persons criteria. The Board takes seriously the d uties and responsibilities of its members, both individually and collectively. Annual appraisals of the Chair, other Non-Executive Directors and Executive Directors are carried out to review and develop performance.

The ac counting policies follow International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), HM Treas ury's Resource Accounting Manual and Department of Health and Soc ial Care Group Acco unting Manual 2018/19, to the e xtent that they are meaningful and appropriate to the NHS. The accounts represent a true and fair position of the Trust. The Directors consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced a nd und erstandable and pro vide the information necessary for patients, r egulators and other stakeholders to assess the NHS Foundation Trust's performance, business model and strategy. 44 2.2 Remuneration Report The Remun eration Report is not subject to aud it, except the elemen ts specifically identified as be ing su bject to aud it. This remu neration re port is prepared in comp liance with the relevant sub-sections of the Compan ies Act 2006 s420-422; Regulation 11 and Parts 3 and 5 of Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Compan ies and Group (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 200 8; Parts 2 and 4 of Schedule 8 of those Regulations as adopted by NHS Impro vement within the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual 2018/19 and also, elements of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governanc e. The Remun eration Report discloses information on those persons in senior positions having authority or responsibility for directing or controlling the major activities of the Trust. The Board has determined that such persons are those who ro utinely attend Board meetings and which, at the end of the year under review, comprise the Chair, seven Non-Executive Director s, and seven Executive Director s. All are identified in section 2.1. A new Director of Nursing, Therapies and Quality commenced in Apr il 2018 and a new Medical Director in May 2018 (b oth app ointments having been made in 2017/18). The Remun eration Report comprises three sections: Annual stat ement on remuneration by the Appointments and Remuneration Committee Chair Senior managers' remu neration policy Annual report on remuneration (of which some information is subject to audit). Annual stateme nt on remun eration by the Appointments and Remuneration Comm ittee Chair The Committee has made four maj or decisions during the course of the year: Cost of Living Award for Executive Directors At the Appointments and Remune ration Committee in March 2019, the Committee agreed that that a flat rate uplift of \u00a32,075 a year be awarded to Executive Directors, as the cost of living award for 2018/19, backdated to 1 Apr il 2018. This was based on national advice from NHS Improvemen t. Appointment of a Deputy Chief Executive The Committee agreed, in June 201 8, to appoint Eugine Yafele as Deputy Chief Executive. Appointment of a Chief Executive In December, the Committee agreed that Eugine Yafele be appointed as Chief Executive of the Trust, subject to the a pproval of the a ppointment by the Council of Governor s. The Council of Governors subsequently approved the a ppointment. Adoption of Remun eration Principles for Executive Directors In May 2018 the Committee agreed remun eration principles to guide its future decision-making in respect of Executive Director remuner ation. 45 Nick Yeo, Chair, Appointments and Remuneration Committee May 2019 Senior Managers' Remuneration Policy The following information constitutes the senior managers' remuneration policy of the Trust. There was appro priate engagement with those employees affected by the policy. Future Remun eration Policy The remuneration pri nciples for Executive Directo rs, referred to above, now form part of the overall Trust remun eration strategy and policy. They are aimed at positioning the Trust in a way that it is able to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors of sufficient calibre to maintain high quality patient-centred healthcare and effecti ve management of Trust resources. The Appointments and Remuner ation Committee acknowledges the merits in the Trust being part of the national Agenda for Change frame work, in particular, the concern to ens ure that equal pay principles app ly. With the exception of Executive Directors, the Trust pay strategy rema ins within the national Agenda for Change scheme. Discretion beyond Agenda for Change rates is, however, an area where attention may be appropriate to help ensure suitability of staffing and attract and retain high quality staff. An overriding consideration has been the importance of ensuring th at the Trust approach to pay and decisions regarding pay is consistent with the performance of the organisation. In 20 18/19 the Trust's Senior Manager Remuneration components were: Role Basic salary Pension Board allowance Chief Executive Chief Operating Officer Medical Director Director of Nursing, Therapies & Qu ality Director of Finance & Strategic Development Director of HR Director of Organisation Development & Participation Basic salary - Salaries for very senior managers in the Trust have been determined by the Appointments and Remuner ation Committee taking into account: the responsibilities; benchmarking with Director roles in other trusts; the differential with direct reports of Directors trends in the public sector such as austerity measures, equitable pay, compet ition for talent within the NHS sector and the re lative size and comp lexity of comp etitor provider organisations. Pension - Pension co ntributions are made by both the senior managers and the Trust in accordance with the provisions of the NHS Pensions Sch eme. 46 Board allowance - the Medical Director retains a clinical compon ent to the role and, as such, receives a full-time C onsultant salary in accord ance with nat ional terms and cond itions for doctors as well as an allowance for Board responsibilities. The performance of all very senior managers, with the exception of the Chief Executive, is reviewed by the Chief Executive. The Chief Executive's performance is reviewed by the Trust Chair in conjunction with the Appointments and Remuneration Committee. The Chair's performance is reviewed by the Senior Independent Director who gathers views from the other members of the Board of Directors and the views of the Council of Governors. The other Non-Executive Directors are reviewed by the Trust Chair and the Council of Governor s. A process is used which allows the Council's perceptions on performance to be included and reflected within the Non-Executive review. The Trust does not operate a performance related p ay framework. The Chief Executive is the only very senior manager whose pay exceeds \u00a315 0,000 p.a. Payment to the Medical Director also exceeds this sum, however the largest component of his salary relates to his clinical duties. The remu neration of very senior managers (Chief Executive and E xecutive Directors) is determined by the Appointments and Remuneration Committee. As a general principle, there is a common 'baseline' salary for Executive Direct ors equivalent to the Agenda for Change Band 9 maxima. It is recognised that certain executive roles may carry additional duties and responsibilities which warrant a higher level of remun eration and individual cases are considered by the Appointments and Remun eration Committee. Non-Executive Director remuner ation components Non-Executive Directors receive remun eration in the form of an annual payment and, in some cases, an allowance for additional responsibilities. Details are set out below; Name Role Remuneration \u00a3 pa Additional allowances \u00a3 pa Allowance title Andy Willis Chair 44,250 - Heather Baily Non-executive Director 13,000 - David Brook Non-executive Director 13,000 2,000 Quality Governance Committee Chair John Carvel Non-executive Director 13,000 - John McBride Non-executive Director 13,000 2,000 Audit Committee Chair Sarah Murray Non-executive Director 13,000 2,000 Mental Health Le gislation Assurance C ommittee Chair Belinda Phipps Non-executive Director 13,000 - Nick Yeo Non-executive Director 13,000 2,000 Senior Independent Directo r/Appointments and Remuner ation Committee Chair 47 Service Contract Obligations In compliance with the G4 (3) NHS Improvement Condition for Board appointments, contracts for Directors contain a provision permitting su mmary termination in the event of a Director being or becoming an unfit person. Contracts do not make provision for individual entitlements for any termination payments, other than pay in lieu of six months' contractual notice p ay. Entitlements to payment for outstanding annual leave in acc ordance with the individual contract provisions can a lso apply. Policy on Payment for Loss of Office The Trust seeks to support and retain staff who are affected by organisational change wherever possible. Where su itable alternative emp loyment cannot be found at an equivalent pay grade and seniority, the provisions of the Trust's protection policy may apply if alternat ive mutually acceptable work is found at a lower pay grade. If redundancy is the o nly option, payments are made in acc ordance with Agenda for Change national conditions of service. There is provision for pay in lieu of notice when appropri ate where there is a contractual provision for this. Notice periods for all grades of staff, including Directors, have been su bject to consultation and agreement with trade union representatives. In cas es of redundancy of Directors, the Trust will apply provisions equivalent to Agenda for Change national conditions of service, including the application of any salary caps, and payments will not be expected to exceed contractual entitlements. There were no redundancies amongst Directors in 2018/19. In cas es of capability arising from performance concerns, the Trust will seek to apply the provisions of the Disciplinary & Capability Policy and Proced ures to support a return to full performance wherever possible. Where continued performance iss ues do not support continuation in the senior post, this may involve redeployment to an alternative post at the same or a lower pay grade, or a managed exit from the organisation which may include the exercise of discretion in respect of notice and garden leave within contra ctual provisions. In the e vent of gross misconduct, the Trust may summarily terminate a Director 's employment (subject to investigation and consideration in accordance with the Disciplinary & Capability Policy). Notice pay will also not normally apply where termination of employment arises in conn ection with the fit and proper person pro visions. There were no d ismissals among Directors in 201 8/19. Assessme nt of the continued fitness of Directors to perform their duties and responsibilities is undertaken a nnually. Statement of considerations of employment conditions elsewhere in the Trust The Trust remun erates senior managers at the rate nece ssary to attract and retain the talent required to de liver the Board's objectives, without needlessly diminishing finite pub lic resources. A policy and approach for the remun eration of the Chief Executive and Directors was introduced in February 2016. 48 Annual Report on Remuneration Service Contracts Details of service con tracts are set out below; Job Title Date of last contract Unexpired term Notice period Chief Executive 1.2.19 n/a - permanent appointment 6 months Chief Operating Officer (vacant post) 18.02.19 - interim appointment 6 month app ointment 1 month Medical Director (Board allowance on ly) 30.1.18 n/a - permanent appointment 6 months Director of Finance & Strategic Development 6.7.16 n/a - permanent appointment 6 months Director of Human Resources 13.11.17 n/a - permanent appointment 6 months Director of Nursing Therapies & Quality 16.4.18 n/a - permanent appointment 6 months Director of Organisation Development & Participation 1.12.15 n/a - permanent appointment 6 months Appointments and Remuneration Committee The Board has an Appointments and Remuneration Committee which, as its core role Appoints senior staff; and Considers recommendations on Executive Director remuneration.

The aim is for staff to feel engaged and well-motivated a nd able to de liver excellent care because they feel proud ab out where they work and passionate about the role they play within the Trust. At the core of our HR Strategy is the attraction, recruitment and retention of an expert, diverse and compass ionate workforce that is single minded in its patient focus. Our organising principle is to be Better Every Day and an empowered workforce is needed to ach ieve this. The Trust aims to be the employer of choice and for staff to be proud of what they do for the p eople of Dorset. The HR Strategic Goals are: Goal 1: To become a recognised employer of choice so that we attract and recruit to meet our workforce needs. Goal 2: To retain a compassionate, e xpert workforce that is proud to work at Dorset HealthCare, and feels developed and supp orted to make decisions, innovate and impro ve the lives of our patients. There are five key themes for activity woven throu ghout our HR strategy - Attraction, Recruitment, Retention, Recognition and Development - and these support delivery of our objectives. The Trust HR Strategy, Better Every Day (2015-2020), supports this transformational approach to workforce planning. This is now undergoing further development to mitigate the risks of Dorset's ability to retain, attract, recruit and develop its health and social care workforce, which is co mpounded by: the ageing workforce; an increased sickness absence across some organisations/ser vices; the reduction in training places /opportunities; changes in funding levy / bursaries; the h igh cost of living; the sca le and pace of change (Clinical Services R eview, East Reconfiguration, Local Governme nt Review); and Brexit implications. The Board last considered key themes for the refreshed Workforce Strategy and Overarch ing Workforce Plan in November 2018. The Board will be co nsidering the new strategy in May 2019. Workforce planning takes place within and acr oss operational directorates, supported by the HR and workforce directorate. Local workforce plans are developed within each Director ate and form part of a single workforce planning approach, reviewed in line with the financial and service plans for the organisation. Budget managers have received training to enhance workforce planning capability across the Trust. A dedicated workforce planning and intelligence is being estab lished. The focus is on workforce transformation and productivity improvement, with investment in leadership capability and capac ity to drive and supp ort this. 58 More broad ly, the Dorset integrated c are system is increas ingly focussing on workforce planning to ensure workforce plans which cross organisational boundaries are developed. The Trust focuses closely on the most appropriate use of the a vailable workforce. The Trust is increas ing the use of apprenticeships in clinical and non -clinical roles. A bre akdown of the Trust workforce is set out in the following tables: Our Staff Profiled The tables below provide an o verview of the composition of our workforce.

Over the course of the year, the Trust has strengthen ed its health and safety / fire safety capability throu gh: reviewing ligature management plans for inpatient services and d esigning safe free anti-ligature alternatives. working with Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue including tra ining exercises and familiarisation visits to high risk properties. designing and delivering a range of health, safety and fire training including digital fire extinguisher simulation training and emergency evacuation techniques. The Trust champions a positive health and safety culture. This focus has helped achieve a reduction in non-clinical litigation claims made against the Trust, a reduction in the number of workplace incidents reported to the Health and Safety Executive and an overall reduction in the grading of incidents.

Where National or Internat ional supply chains are use d, we expect these supp liers to have suitable Ant i-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policies and Procedures and, where there is a risk of Slavery and Human Trafficking taking place, steps have been taken to assess and manage that risk. Develop a l evel of communication with the next link in the supply chain and their understanding of, and compliance with, our expectations in relation to the NHS terms and con ditions. These conditions relate to issues such as bribery, slavery and other ethical considerations. Working in partnership with Multi-Agency Partners who are leading on this Agenda within Dorset. Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking training is available to all Dorset HealthCare staff as part of their Core Safeguarding one to three training. Additional training is available via the L ocal Safeguarding Adult's and Children's Boards, Community Groups. Development of additional supporting tools will be ma de available on the Trust intranet. This stateme nt is made pursuant to Section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and const itutes our organisation's Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking statement for the financial year 2018 - 19. Staff Engagement The Trust approach to staff engagement is to nurture a culture of empowerment, openness and transparency, where everyone is encouraged to be involved in dec ision-making and quality impro vement. In addition to supporting line ma nagers and leaders to engage their staff and beyond the statutory Friends and Family Test the Trust regularly seeks staff views through: focus groups; Board Director visits; ad hoc engagement events; all-staff surveys and through Board director hosted d iscussions called 'DHC Connect'. 64 The annual innovation compet ition Dragons' Den, encourages all staff to enter their ideas for impro vement projects, linked to our quality impro vement programme, and staff are encouraged to nominate colleagues for the monthly and ann ual Dorset HealthCare Heroes awards. In 201 8/19 staff were engaged in discuss ions about smarter working and reward and recognition, as well as s tarting engagement about development of our Trust strategy. A major engagement campaign enco uraging staff to take up the winter flu vaccination continued to be a key priority and the Trust achieved a s mall increase on 2017/18. The annual NHS staff survey is another important way for the Trust to find out people's experiences of working at Dorset HealthCare. Its benchmarking results allows for comparis ons to be made with simi lar Trusts. The Annual Staff Survey - What Our Staff Say The NHS staff survey is conducted annually. From 2018 onwards, the results from questions are grouped to give scores in ten indicators. The indicator scores are based on a score out of 10 for certain questions with the indicator score being the average of those. The response rate to the 2018 survey among trust staff was 51.6% (2017: 49.3%). Scores for each indicator together with that of the survey benchmarking group (Mental Health, Learning Disabilities, and Community Health) are presented below. 2018 /19 2017 /18 2016/17 Trust Benchmarking Group Trust Benchmarking Group Trust Benchmarking Group Equality, diversity and inclusion 9.4 9.2 9.4 9.2 9.4 9.2 Health and wellbeing 6.4 6.1 6.5 6.1 6.5 6.2 Immediate managers 7.3 7.2 7.4 7.1 7.2 7.1 Morale 6.6 6.2 n/a n/a n/a n/a Quality of appraisals 5.4 5.5 5.4 5.4 5.2 5.4 Quality of care 7.5 7.4 7.6 7.4 7.6 7.5 Safe environment - bullying and harassment 8.5 8.2 8.5 8.3 8.3 8.2 Safe environment - violen ce 9.6 9.5 9.5 9.5 9.5 9.5 Safety culture 6.9 6.8 6.8 6.7 6.7 6.7 Staff engagement 7.3 7.0 7.3 7.0 7.2 7.0 65 Response Rate The increase in response rate (51.6% from 49.3% last year) is attributed to two new initiatives: firstly, further work has been undertaken to ensure that all staff are able to respond to the survey in the way that most suits their circumstances. Analysis was undertaken to identify those staff who do not regularly use email due to the nature of their role and ensure only those staff receive their survey by post. Secondly, team meetings were visited during the fieldwork period so staff could address any concerns they have about the survey. Areas of improvement and deterioration Areas of improvement (where the change is a minimum of 3%) There has been a 3% increase in staff satisfaction with the recognition they get for good work, rising to 65% (62% last year) More staff than ever are satisfied with the extent we value their work, rising to 51% (48% last year) 68% of staff agree that they receive regular updates on patient / service user experience (65% last year) 62% of staff agree that we treat staff who are involved in an error, near miss or incident fairly (54% in 2017) 63% of staff agree that they are given feedback about changes made in response to errors, near misses and incidents (60% in 2017) More staff than ever feel secure raising concerns about unsafe clinical practice - 75% (72% in 2017) 63% of staff agree that we would address their concerns (60% in 2017) Staff recommending the Trust as a place to work has increased to 68% (from 65% in 2017) Comparisons to benchmarking group Within our benchmark group of 31 similar Trusts in England (community, mental health and learning disability) we are placed third overall when looking at the total sum of the ten themes' scores. The Trust has the top score of like Trusts in two out of ten themes: Equality, diversity and inclusion (9. 4) Immediate managers (7.3) The Trust has the sec ond highest score within our benchmark group for: Morale (6.6) Safe environment - bullying and harassment (8.5) Safe environment - violence ( 9.6) Staff engagement (7.3) The health and wellbeing score (6.4) is the third highest in the benchmark group with on ly Solent NHS (6.5) Trust and Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (6.6) scori ng higher. The only theme where the Trust scores lower than average is Quality of appraisals (5.4 versus 5.5 average). 66 Acting on staff survey findings The primary approach to acting on the survey findings is to embed ownership of the results and actions in teams and services, as well as key Trust groups identifying cross-cutting themes. From March to May detailed reports and breakdowns are provided to a number of forums. These include the Staff Partnership Forum, the Health and Safety Committee, the Equality and Diversity Steering Group, the Security Advisory Group, the Doctors and Dentists' Joint Negotiating Forum and Hidden Abilities. The Trust has taken a very deliberate approach to embedding ownership of actions within services, whilst sharing the insights with as many people as possible across the organisation. Directorate-specific reports have been produc ed for discussion and action planning at each of the director ate-level management meetings and are being cascaded through to locality and service leads and managers. Between February and April all service areas results were reviewed with the service lead or locality ma nager and local impro vement plans developed. Each service area or locality will receive a bespoke report that shows a two year comp arison. To address Trust-wide concerns, the staff survey review group (whose membersh ip is Staff Governors and our trade union partnership forum joint chairs) has identified three areas for specific work: the experience of managers in bands 5 and 6 roles; supporting everyone to feel valued at work; and senior manager/Board visibility and communications. A progr amme of activity is being developed and guided with the steering group. How we Have Applied our Policies All Trust policies include an Equality Impact Assessme nt to identify whether any of the prote cted ch aracteristic groups is affected less or more favourably than another and where potential discrimination is identified, documents whether the e xceptions are valid, legal and/or justified. The Recruitment and Selection Policy clearly sets out the Trust's commitment to equality of opportunity for both employed and pros pective staff and supports a culture where our workforce is representative of the communities we service and where differenc es are recognised, accepted and valued. In addition, the Trust has signed a commitment to act positively towards disabled people and is p ermitted to use the 'Two Ticks' (Positive abo ut Disabled People Symbol) on adverts and recru itment literature. As part of this commitment disabled app licants who me et The essential criteria of the person specification for a post, will be guaranteed an interview. The Trust Policy and Guide for Managing Health Wellbeing and Attendance rec ognises that Health and Wellbeing is about ensuring th at people feel good and function well both physically and mentally. The overall aim is to promote health and wellbeing and to reduce sickness absence levels. Both managers and staff are expected to play a role in pr omoting health and wellbeing and managing attendance. The Trust seeks to ensure th at development opportunities are available for all employees and the Learning and Development Policy applies to all employees and is designed to provide a c onsistent approach to learning and development and to ensure fair and equal access to all employees. 67 Good communications and co nsultation are central to the management process when dealing with cha nges in working pra ctices and procedures as set out within the Organisational Change Policy and Proced ure. Any employee discovering or suspecting fraud, bribery or corruption is encouraged to report the matter immediately to either the Counter Fraud Specialist, their line manager, Human Resources or the Director of Finance. The Counter Fraud Specialist will liaise with HR in accordance with the LCFS Framework for Liaison with Human Resources. Suspicions of fraud, bribery and corruption can a lso be reported using the NHS Fraud and Corruption Reporting Line powered by Crimestopp ers, on free-phone 0800 028 40 60 or by filling in an online form at www.cfa.nhs.uk/reportfraud, as an alternat ive to intern al reporting procedures. Stakeholder relations The Trust is proud of the strength of partnership working and recognise its importance in the Board Ass urance Framework. Throughout the year the Trust has continued to maintain significant partnerships and alliances that enable the delivery of impro ved healthcare. Our significant partnerships are: Dorset Integrated Care System: the Our Dorset partnership is co nsidered a leading integrated care system in England, recognised as an exemplar for the strength of its positive relations and partnership working. This has facilitated much more integrated planning and delivery of health and care services, supporting us to work together to achieve the best outcom es for our population from our comb ined resources. Partnership working with Dorset Mental Health Forum: The Trust is proud of its relationship with Dorset Mental Health For um, which has h ad such a p ivotal ro le in peers and people with lived experience working acro ss our mental health ser vices. The jointly-run Recovery Education Centre combines the very best of our individual strengths and has nat ional and intern ational recognition through the Wellbeing and Recovery Partnership. As part of the Trust quality impro vement programme work is taking place with the Forum to embed co- producti on and lived experience into our corporate methodology. Primary Care Partnerships: The Trust has continued to strengthen relationships and primary care partnerships across the County, building on the pr ogress made through creation of 13 localities, facilitating mo re meaningful local conversat ions. This has supported the Trust to better integrate delivery of primary and community services through comb ining res ources. Dorset Integrated Urgent Care Service: The Trust is the lead provider for the pan-Dorset Integrated Urgent Care Service, a service de livered through a partnership arrangement of all of the NHS providers in the co unty with the South West Ambulance Ser vice. Wessex Academic Health Science Network: The Trust has strong working re lationships with Wessex Academic Health Network, working together on regional patient safety and quality impro vement work. The regional 'Qs' meet to de pacity and capa bility in quality impro vement across the region. The Trust has continued to de velop ser vices acr oss organisational boundaries in line with the c ommitments made in Dorset's Clinical Services Review and Mental Health Acute Care Pathway Review, as well as the wider Integrated Care System operational plan. This has included: Development of integrated co mmunity services hubs and teams in localities, in many cases working acr oss commu nity, primary and secondary care boundaries in multi- disciplinary teams running virtual wards 68 The opening and successful operation of The Retreat in Bournemouth, in partnership with Dorset Mental Health Forum The development of Weymouth's Urgent Treatment Centre in partnership with Dorset County Hospital and local GPs, reducing trips to the emergency department in Dorchester The ongoing development and impro vements to Dorset 's Integrated Sexual Health Service; Dorset HealthCare is the lead provider working in partnership with Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch h ospital and Dorset County Hospital Ongoing development of our vetera ns' care pathway, co-produc ed with vetera ns and local third sector partners and agencies. This won the national Excellence in Mental Health Care award at the NHS 70 Parliamentary awards in July 2018 Development of an innovative volunteer service to support end-of-life care, in partnership with primary care colleagues in Purbeck, which secured \u00a375,000 funding from national charity Helpforce and will launch in 2019 Development of the pan-Dorset Integrated Urgent Care Service Other public and patient involvement activities The Trust has not undertaken any formal consultation acti vities in 2 018/19 although engagement has continued with a range of partners, Members, c ommu nity representatives and the public. The Trust approach to public engagement sets out a flexible and ada ptive collection of ways in which peo ple are engaged and involved in developing ser vices and wider decision-making. In 201 8/19 this has included: A more robust member engagement and recruitment plan developed with the Council of Governors including starting a programme of member engagement events; the annual members' meeting; a quarterly newsletter for members Close working with system partners to create the Our Dorset Public Engagement Group with Dorset Healthcare staff involved in selecting members of the group and the ch air A reference group including a wide ra nge of stakeholders to help develop services in Shaftesbury and the surrounding area (north Dorset) A ste ering group for developing services in the Purbeck area includes local stakeholders Work with the p eople of Portland to shape the future of services on the island through a ser ies of public meetings Engaging with the community around Alderney Hospital in Poole as we move towards estab lishing a Centre of Excellence for Older People's Care there The Trust has contact, ad hoc e vents and ann ual events with nearly fifty local community groups that connect with people from different equality groups. The insights and feedback from these events are fed back through the equality and diversity committee and/or go direct to services for a response or impro vement. All services are enco uraged to engage and involve ser vices users, their families and car ers in the development of services and to seek feedback abo ut patient experience. This includes the mandated Friends and Family test and goes far beyond that to include regular surveying, feedback events, working with expert patients, carers support and working with our peers from the Dorset Mental Health For um. The Trust now co-delivers the Retreat service with peers from the Dorset Mental Health Forum and will continue to build on supporting peer-led services through development of the Commu nity Front Rooms. 69 The Trust has maintained a focus on improving support to carers at Dorset HealthCare working at Dorset system level, with clinical servic es and also focusing on supp orting staff who are carers. The Trust has now been commissioned to provide care rs support to primary care across Dorset. In North Dorset the Trust is piloting the NHS England carers' quality markers and continue to roll out the Triangle of Care and John's Campaign. The Trust has a Trust-wide volunteer service, supported by a Volunteer strategy. The Trust has established a public, patient and carers involvement group whose first objective is to ch ampion and further embed the model of co-production across the Trust. This builds on the excellent practice we know exists in some services, such as at Pebble Lodge and in the Pain Service. Emerge ncy Preparedness, Resilience and Response (EPRR) The NHS needs to plan for, a nd respond to, a wide range of incidents and emergencies that could affect health or patient care. These cou ld be anything from extreme weather conditions to an outbreak of an infectious disease or a major transport accident. The Civil Contingencies Act (2004) requires N HS organisations, and providers of NHS-funded care, to show that they can d eal with such incidents while maintaining services. Each year the Trust is required to undertake an assurance proce ss against the NHS Core Standards for Emergency Preparedn ess, Resilience and R esponse (EPRR). In sment for Dorset Healthcare was 'substantial' and the Trust continues to show improvement across several key areas of the core standards. In November 2018, the Trust undertook an Incident Co-ordination Centre Exercise (I CC), to test the Incident Response Plan and On-Call procedures. These plans all comp ly with the current EPRR legislation. During the year, the Chief Operating Officer represented the Trust at the Health Resilience Partnership (LHRP) and the Emergency Planning and Resilience Officer (EPRO) worked with external EPRR stakeholders and our Trust Emergency Planning Group, to ens ure consistency in EPRR arrangements. This year has seen the Trust undertake planning and pre paredness activities to ensure its readiness for any potential impact of the UK leaving the EU. This included participating in an EU Exit Exercise in December 2018 and then testing the Trust's final planning and prepar ation in a multi-agency Exercise in ear ly March 2019. Co-operation between organisations to prepare for, respond to and recover from emergencies is essential for ensuring ro bust arrangements are in place. To achieve this, the Trust works closely with other organisations through well-estab lished part nerships, prior to and dur ing major incidents. Expenditure on consultancy The Trust has focussed on re ducing consultancy and off-payroll arrangements in 201 8/19 alongside work to reduce agency expenditure. In 2015/16, the Trust introduced a Professional Register of people with a wide ra nge of skills and experience in fields su ch as operational management, human resources, and project management, who are able to undertake short and medium-term assignments as and when required, working within a pay framework aligned to Agenda for Change rates. Through this arrangement in 201 8/19, total expenditure on co nsultancy amounted to \u00a3321k (2017/18 \u00a3 252k). 70 Counter Fraud Service The Local Counter Fraud Specialist (LCFS): received four allegations of fraud during the reporting period, one criminal investigation remained open at the start of 2018/19, one new criminal investigation was ope ned during 201 8/19, Both investigations have been closed. As a result of the investigations conducted by the LCFS one disciplinary sanction was applied. The LCFS also de livered a c omprehe nsive pro gramme of work to prevent and dete ct fraud, bribery and corruption and to ensure that the Trust complied with its contractual obligations in relation to Ser vice Condition 24 of the NHS standard contract. Trade Union Fa cility Time The Trust published the Trade Union and Facility Times in accordance with the 2017 regulations. In accorda nce with sched ule 2 of the regulations and ann ex A of the Cabinet Office guidance the following information was published. Trade u nion re presentatives and full-time equivalents Trade un ion representatives: 37 FTE trade union representatives: 32.49 Percentage of working hours spe nt on facility time 0% of working hours: 26 representatives 1 to 50% of working hours: 8 representatives 51 to 99% of working hours: 0 representatives 100% of working hours: 1 representatives Total pay bill and facility time costs Total cost of facility time: \u00a328784 Percent age of pay spent on facility time: 0.02% Paid trade union a ctivities Hours spent on paid facility time: 1950 Hours spent on paid trade union activities: 300 Percent age of total paid facility time hours spent on paid TU activities: 15.38% Off - Payroll Engagement The data below covers highly paid and / or senior off- payroll engagements between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019. Compliance che cks are performed on appropriate engagements to determine whether inside of scope for IR35. Where deemed inside of scope, tax is deducted at source prior to payment. 71 Table 1: For all off-payroll engagements as of 31 March 2019, for more than \u00a3245 per day and that last for longer than six months No. of existing engagements as of 31 Mar 2019 36 Of which: Number that have existed for less than one year at the time of reporting 10 Number that have existed for between one and two years at the time of reporting 10 Number that have existed for between two and three years at the time of reporting 7 Number that have existed for between three and four years at the time of reporting 1 Number that have existed for four or more years at the time of reporting 8 Table 2: For all new off-payroll engagements, or those that reached six months in d uration, between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, for more than \u00a3245 per day and that last for longer than six months: Number of new engagements, or those that reached six months in duration between 01 Apr 2018 and 31 Mar 2019 34 Of which: Number assess ed as within the scope of IR35 4 Number assess ed as not within the sco pe of IR35 30 Number engaged directly (via PSC contracted to trust) and are on the trust's payroll 0 Number of engagements reassessed for consistency/assurance purposes during the year 34 Number of engagements that saw a cha nge to IR35 st atus following the consistency review 4 Table 3: For any off-payroll engagements of board members, and/or senior officials with significant responsibility, between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019 Number of off-payroll engagements of board members, and/or, senior officials with significant financial responsibility, during the financial year. 1 Number of individuals that have been d eemed 'board memb ers and/or senior officials with significant financial responsibility' during the financial year* 20 *includes Exec utive Directors, Associate Directors and Non-Executive Directors The off-payroll engagement referred to above relates to the a ppointment of an interim Chief Operating Officer. The appointment became vacant on the promotion of the pre vious post holder to the role of Chief Executive. Given the strategic and operational importance of the Chief Operating Office role to the Trust, the Board considered that it was necess ary to make an interim appointment to the position pending the comp letion of the recruitment process for a permanent successor. It is anticipated that a permanent appointment will be made in late June 2019. 72 Exit packages (inform ation subject to au dit) The following exit packages were agreed in 201 8/19. 73 2.4 NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust has applied the principles of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance on a comply or explain bas is. The NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance, most recently revised in July 2014, is based on the principles of the UK Corporate Code of Governance issues in 2012. The Trust is comp liant with all Code provisions. 74 2.5 NHS Impro vement Single Oversig ht Framework NHS Improvement 's Single Oversight Framework provides the frame work for oversee ing providers and identifying potential support needs. The frame work looks at five themes: Quality of care Finance a nd use of resources Operational performance Strategic change Leadership and impro vement capability (well-led) Based on information from these themes, providers are segmented from 1 to 4, where '4' reflects providers receiving the most support, and '1' reflects providers with maximum autonomy. A foundation trust will only be in seg ments 3 or 4 where it has been found to be in breach or suspected breach of its licence. The Single Oversight Framework applied from Quarter 3 of 2016/17. Prior to this, Monitor's Risk Assessme nt Framework (RAF) was in place. Information for the prior year and first two quarters of 2016/17 relating to the RAF has not been prese nted as the b asis of accountability was different. This is in line with NHS Improvement 's guidance for annual reports. There ha ve been no breaches to the Trust licence over the course of 2018/19. Segmentation The Trust is in segment 1. This segmentation information is the Trust's position as at 31 March 2019. Current segmentation information for NHS trusts and foundation trusts is published on the NHS Improvement website. Finance a nd use of resources The finance and use of resources theme is based on the scoring of five measures from '1' to '4' where '1' reflects the strongest performance. These scores are then weighted to give an overall score. Given th at finance and use of resources is only one of the five themes feeding into the Single Oversight Framework, the s egmentation of the trust disclosed a bove might not be the same as the overall finance score here: Area Metric Capital service capacity 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Liquidity 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Financial efficiency I&E margin 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Financial controls Distance from financial plan 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Agency spend 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Overall scoring 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 76 2.7 Annual Governance Stat ement Scope of responsibility As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal control that supports the achievement of the NHS foundation trust's policies, aims and objectives, whilst safeguarding the public funds and departmental assets for which I am personally responsible, in accorda nce with the responsibilities ass igned to me. I am also responsible for ensuring that the NHS foundation trust is administered prudently and eco nomic ally and that resources are app lied efficiently and effectively. I also acknowledge my responsibilities as set out in the NHS Foundation Tru st Accounting Officer Memora ndum. The purpose of the s ystem of internal control The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure to achieve policies, aims and objectives; it can therefore on ly provide re asonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of intern al control is based on an ongoing process designed to identify and prioritise the risks to the achievement of the policies, aims and objectives of Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust, to evaluate the likelihood of those risks being realised and the impact should they be realised, and to manage them efficiently, effectively and econ omically. The system of internal control has been in place in Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust for the year ended 31 March 2019 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts. Capacity to ha ndle risk Risk Management Leadership and Training The Trust has continued to de velop risk management processes in the organisation. These processes are overseen by coherent and comprehensive management structures and roles. Non-Executive Directors are aware of their responsibilities in re lation to risk management and cha ir all Board Committees. All Board Committees and Executive Groups ha ve defined terms of reference setting out responsibilities for risk management where appropri ate. Two Executive groups-the Executive Quality and Clinical Risk Group and the Executive Performance and Non-Clinical Risk Group-receive deta ils of all risks scoring 10+, information relating to material changes to the significant risk profile, action plans and progress made. A Risk Management Policy is in place, supported by compre hensive training and communication plans. This, together with the Ulysses e lectronic risk management system, enab les the Trust to effectively manage its clinical and non-clinical risks. As Chief Executive I am the Chief Risk Officer ultimate ly responsible for risk. High level operational responsibility for risk has been delegated to the Director of Nursing, Therapies & Quality for clinical risk and to the Trust Secretary for non-clinical risk. All Directors have a specific responsibility for the identification and prude nt control of risks within their sphere of responsibility and are responsible, where required, for the provision of specialist advice to the Board of Directors. This acknowledges that all Directors are subject 77 matter experts and have specific responsibilities for interpreting and applying national policy, legislation and regulations in respect of their specific areas of expertise. The Senior Clinical Risk Manager, re porting to the Deputy Director of Nursing, Therapies and Quality, has day to day responsibility for the clinical risk management proces s. This encompasses the development of risk management policy, administration of risk management systems and oversight of clinical risk exposures facing the organisation, ensuring the provision of risk management training, supporting Localities, carrying out checks within and a cross Localities to monitor the management of risk and triangulating lessons for learning from clinical risks ensuring defects alerts or changes in practice are conveyed to front line teams promptly. The Head of Regulation and Compliance monitors the quality of services against CQC standards and progress against Quality Priorities, advises on a nd escalates risks relating to regulatory standards and patients, monitors risks relating to medical devices and l eads on the implementation of CQUIN targets to impro ve quality. The Trust Secretary has day to day responsibility to lead on corporate, ie non-clinical risk management processes across the Trust and for managing the Board Assurance Frame work. In add ition the capacity to pro vide leadership to and deliver the risk management function is underpinned by a number of other key roles including; Head of Clinical Effectiveness and Au dit Lead ma nagers for safeguarding ch ildren a nd adults Health and S afety Manager Local Security Management Specialist Fire Safety Officer Caldicott Gu ardian Senior Information Risk Owner Staff are provided with gu idance on r isk management through the Risk Management Policy which clearly sets out why it is essential to manage risk well and commu nicate openly with one anoth er. The Policy sets out a framework that:- Reduces harm for patients, carers, staff, volunteers, contractors, any other stakeholders and the Trust itself; Continuously impro ves pat ient safety, experience, and quality performance; Protects everything of value to the Trust (such as reputation, market share, exemplary clinical outcomes ); Promotes the s uccess of the Trust. The risk and control framework Risk Reporting The Trust aims to keep patients and staff safe at all times. Risk is therefore an ything that is stopping or might stop it from keeping them safe whilst in its care or preventing impro vements in the quality of care. 78 To help identify risks, consideration is given of the Trust's historical operational performance and trends, previous events, current challenges, new innovations from inside and outs ide the Trust, changes in practice identified by external organisations and the needs of the people who use the Trust 's services. The risk analysis involves determining risk severity (the impact the risk has on the p eople in the Trust 's care and the Trust itself) and likelihood (the probability of that impact happening within 12 mo nths). The scores are multiplied to give an o verall risk rating of between 1-25. The risk rating is used to determine risk management priorities and monitor acceptable levels of risk. The Trust actively encourages co nstructive cha llenge of assumpt ions made regarding severity and likelihood. To manage these risks, there is a combination of prevention, detection and cont ingency controls. Prevention controls are part of a system of internal controls designed to prevent a risk from occurring at a ll. They typically involve policies, proced ures, standards, guidelines, training, protective equipmen t/clothing, pre-procedure che cks. Detection controls pro vide an early warning of control failure, such as an alarm, incident reports, complaints, performance reports, audits. They tell the Trust how well the prevention co ntrols are working. Contingency controls help prepare for an effecti ve reaction in response to a major control failure, shocks or an overwhelming event. Contingency controls are designed to maintain resilience. They include reserves of time and money. The proce ss for managing risk is clearly defined in the Risk Management Policy in six steps as follows: Step 1: Determine priorities Step 2: Identify risk Step 3: Assess risk Step 4: Respond to the risk-seek, accept, avoid, transfer, modify Step 5: Report Risk Step 6: Review Risk The frame work for reviewing risks, controls, assurances and action plans is through the submission of reports, generated from Ulysses, as follows: 15 - Board of Directors; significant risk report (ie 15+); monthly; 15 - Board of Directors; Board assurance framework (BAF) quarterly; 15 - Audit Committee and the QGC: Board assurance framework (BAF) quarterly; 10 - Executive Quality & Clinical Risk Group monthly; Executive Per formance & Corpor ate Risk Group monthly; 8 - Specialty/Locality Management Groups monthly; 6 - Ward/Departmental Management monthly. During the course of 2017/18 the Board agreed a risk appetite statement. This provides further guidance to Directors with regard to the tolerance for risk within the Trust. Any risk which exceeds the designated risk threshold score is reported to the relevant Board Committee a nd, if appropriate, the Board. This framework will be e volving in 201 9/20 following the formation of an Executive Committee. 79 Strategic Risks The Board identified se ven risks to the Trust strategic objectives in 2 018/19: Failures in care caused by inconsistent and unwarranted variations in the provision of services to patients. Failure to provide a pos itive pat ient experience as a result of not implementing best pract ice or learning from the lessons from incidents within the Trust and from other organisations. Failure to maximise the opportunities provided by strategic partnerships to deliver integrated health and social care. Failure to ha ve in p lace the required workforce by not - recru iting and retaining a sufficient workforce to deliver the Trust objectives; - developing an engaged and motivated workforce. Failure to de liver the Trust Financial Plan by not delivering the CIP and lack of appropri ate budgetary control and inadequate forecasting. Failure to secure the medium term financial sustainability of the Trust as a result of changed commissioning intent ions, service reconfigurations, structural change and/or inadequate financial planning and forecasting. Failure to limit the environmental impact of the Trust as a result of not delivering the Sustainable Development Management Plan. Following a review, the Board revised the strategic goals in November 2018. The revised goals are: 1. To provide high quality care; first time, every time. 2. To be an influential and effective partner in the Dorset Integrated Care System. 3. To have a skilled, diverse and c aring workforce who are proud to work for Dorset HealthCare. 4. To ensure that all of the Trust's resources are used in an efficient and sustainable way. The revised s trategic risks were identified as: Failures in care caused by inconsistent and unwarranted variations in the provision of services to patients; Failure in care as a result of: i) not implementing fully the 'must do' and 'should do' actions in respect of the Care Quality Commission safety domain within an acceptab le timescale; and 80 ii) not achieving, at the time of the next assessment, an impro vement in the Trust rating in respect of the s afety domain from 'requires improvement' to 'good' Failure to maximise the opportunities provided by strategic partnerships to deliver integrated health and social care. Failure to ha ve in p lace the required workforce by not i) recru iting and retaining a sufficient workforce to deliver the Trust objectives; ii) providing an environment in which staff have the opportunity to learn from pract ice and experience in the Trust and beyond; and iii) developing an engaged and motivated workforce. Failure to de liver the Trust Financial Plan by not delivering the CIP and lack of appropri ate budgetary control and inadequate forecasting. Failure to secure the medium term financial sustainability of the Trust as a result of changed commissioning intent ions, service reconfigurations, structural change and/or inadequate financial planning and forecasting. Strategic risks have been reviewed over the course of the year by the Board, the Quality Governance Committee, the Audit Committee, the Executive Quality & Clinical Risk Group and the Executive Performance & Corporate Risk Group. Reporting of progress in mitigating the likelihood of these risks occurring has de veloped over the co urse of 2018/19 to enhance u nderstanding of key assurances and actions planned and comp leted. Quality Governance Arrangements The Trust is fully comp liant with the registration requirements of the Care Quality Commission. Quality performance is reported to the Directorate Management Groups and the Executive Quality and Clinical Risk Group on a monthly basis. Scrutiny and assuran ce is obta ined through the Quality Governance Committee. Quality performance is also monitored by the Clinical Commissioning Gro up at the monthly contract review meetings. With regard to data quality, a sample is checked monthly to ensure that it is accurate and reliable. Compliance with Care Quality Commission (CQC) registration has, over the course of the year, been based around assessment visits by the Regulation and Compliance Team and the production and review of action plans following the CQC inspection in late 2017. Data Security Risk Process Staff are encouraged to report all information security incidents, whether suspected or actual so that they can be investigated, appropriate actions taken to ad dress the incident and 81 lessons learnt to prevent reoccurrence. They are reported using Ulysses, with the risks being graded in accord ance with the risk matrix in the usual way. The Information Governance Manager, Senior Information Risk Owner and Caldicott Guardian and deputies are alerted of all data security incidents. All level two incidents will be re ported via the IG Toolkit Incident Reporting Tool which informs the Department of Health, HSCIC and the Information Commissioner's Office of data breaches. This is done within 24 h ours of the incident and investigated, with the aim of closing the incident within five days. The Trust Information Governance Steering Group (IGSG) promotes a consistent approach to information governan ce. It is responsible for developing and sharing good pra ctice across the Trust and ensuring that information governan ce standards are included in other work programmes and projects. It co-ordinates the review of the Trust 's information governance management and accountability arrangements and prod uces and monitors the annual information governance work programme. Any matters of concern are escalated to the Executive Per formance and Corpor ate Risk Group. The Trust will, under its duty of candour, inform service users if there has been a breach in respect of their personal information. Incident Reporting The Trust uses an online re porting system, Ulysses, for all types of incidents (clinical and non-clinical). The system enables real time notifications to be sent to identified people. These are centrally set up and relate to the type or severity of the incident ensuring that the correct people are aware when an incident has occurred. The Trust encourages staff to report incidents and near misses and sees reporting as a sign of a healthy safety culture. The Trust rema ins in the top third of the highest reporters to the National Reporting and Learning System for patient safety incidents in the reporting cluster. Training in incident reporting is embedded in various training pr ogrammes such as the prevention and management of violence and aggression, induction, health and s afety and clinical risk training. Samples of clinical records are reviewed to see whether incidents recorded in the clinical record are reported via the incident reporting system. In 2018/19 the top five reported types of incident were in respect of: Violence/assau lts Pressure ulcers Slips, trips and falls Self-harm Medication The lessons learnt from serious incidents are captured in real time on the intranet via the lessons learnt booklet and deta ils are included monthly in the Quality Matters newsletter and within the locality quality reports. Learning is also incorporated into clinical training. Workforce The Trust has a workforce plan that is linked directly to the strategic vision and priorities of the organisation including our Better Every Day programme. 82 The ongoing development of our organisational culture and the need to mobilise the workforce to de liver different models and patterns of care will be an area of focus over the next few years, ensuring that the Trust maintains a pos itive organisational culture within a challenging climate. One of the key workforce challenges will be h ow the Trust cat ers for the older adult and frail elderly patients over the coming five years. Combined with an increased prevalence of dementia, the skill base of the workforce may need to change over this period of time and the Trust will need to ensure that the workforce is sufficiently skilled and experienced to supp ort patients appropriately. The workforce will face challenges relating to their own hea lth and wellbeing over the next five years. The Trust has a Health and Wellbeing Strategy with the design and development of a new Wellness Centre for our staff now underway, the Trust is working to wards extending the current offer of health and wellbeing facilitated psychological and therapy support for staff with strong input from staff at all levels within the Trust, as well as key Partner agencies. There is a focus on strong partnership arrangements with local General Practitioners and as the key provider of community healthcare services in Dorset the requirement for an integrated approach to workforce p lanning has now become key. The Trust will make a contribution to this through: Integrated Workforce Planning; workforce plans are be ing developed in each Director ate. As part of this the Trust will support the Dorset Integrated Community and Prim ary Care Workforce forum Workforce Assurance and Quality/ Patient Safety; the Trust has an estab lished Workforce Group which regularly reviews the wider workforce iss ues Workforce Modernisation / New Roles / Enhanced Roles; the Trust is undertaking compete ncy based p lanning and skill mix initiatives to determine the most appropri ate use of the available workforce where required. The Trust is developing the use of Advanced Practitioners (various nursing ro les to date) and apprenticeships to supp ort its longer term vision for the Trust. Workforce, Education and Learn ing; the Trust's Leaning Needs Analysis (LNA) is regularly being re viewed to ens ure that staff receive the right level of training re levant to their role and in line with regulatory and best practice requireme nts. Our Apprenticeship Delivery Plan; Apprenticeships ha ve been a focus for 2018/19 with approximate ly 130 apprentices planned to be on programme by end March 2019. The Trust has a target of recruiting in the region of 750 apprentices over the next five years. Employment Practice As an employer with staff entitled to memb ership of the NHS Pension Scheme, control measures are in p lace to ensure all emp loyer obligations contained within the Scheme regulations are complied with. This includes ens uring th at deductions from salary, employer's contr ibutions and payments into the Scheme are in accordance with the Scheme rules, and that member Pension Scheme records are accurately updated in acc ordance with the timesc ales detailed in the Regulations. 83 Under the pension auto enrolment legislation, we also use NEST as our alternative scheme for those not eligible to access the NHS Pension scheme. Control measures are in place to e nsure that all the organisation's obligations under equality, diversity and human rights legislation are complied with. The Trust has a Diversity and Human Rights implementation Sch eme which de tails the Trust 's commitment to Equality and Diversity in the pro vision of services and the su pport for all staff. Training, communication and equality impact assessme nt, consultation and involvement strategies to address health inequalities and impro ve equality outcomes are all outlined within the scheme. Equality and Diversity training is carried out by all staff that join the Trust as part of the Trust's mandatory induction proces s. In add ition there is a Level 2 Face to Face Equality and Diversity Course for Front Line Clinical Staff, an online Level 2 course and a Level 3 Course for managers and leaders which se ts out how to carry out Equality Impact Analysis. The Trust has undertaken risk assessments and has a sustainable development management plan in place which takes account of UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP 18). The Trust ensures that its obligations under the Climate Change Act and the Adaptation Reporting requireme nts are complied with. The Trust has published an up -to-date register of interes ts for decision-making staff within the p ast twelve months, as required by the 'Managing Conflicts of Interest in the NHS' guidance. Review of economy, efficiency and ef fectiveness and the u se of resources The Trust has an estab lished system of financial control which is l ed by the Director of Finance & Strategic Development. The annual budget setting proc ess for 2018/19 was approved by the Trust Board before the start of the financial year and was commu nicated to all managers in the organisation. The Director of Finance & Strategic Development and his team have worked c losely with managers throughout the year to ensure robust financial management across the Trust. All budget managers have a responsibility to manage their budgets and systems of internal control effectively and efficiently. The processes to ach ieve this are reviewed on an ongoing basis by managers themselves and are a lso examined by intern al audit as part of their annual activities. The Integrated Corporate Dashboard covers quality, operational, workforce and financial performance and is reported to the Trust Board on a monthly basis. It is set against updated quality metrics as well as o verall Trust performance which is tracked with trend ana lysis over a 13 month period. All staff have a responsibility to identify and ass ess risk and to take action to ensure controls are in place to reduce and/or mitigate risks, whilst acknowledging the need for economy, efficiency, and effecti veness of the resources. The Audit Committee receives reports from Directors of the Trust as well as intern al and external audit and Counter Fraud and Security Management, on the work undertaken to review the Trust's systems of control including economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources. Action plans are agreed from these reports to improve controls where necessary. 84 The Trust external auditors give an opinion on the economy, efficiency and effecti veness and the use of resources. For 2018/19, the external auditors have commented that:- Under the Code of Audit Practic e, we must satisfy ourselves, by examination of the financial statements and otherwise, that you have made proper arrangements for securing ec onomy, efficiency and effectiveness in your use of the Trust's resources. We are able to conclude that nothing has come to our attention that indicates that the Trust may not have had pro per arrangements in place throughout the year to ensure effective use of resources. Information g overnance In 201 8/19 the Trust classified two information governance incidents at Level 2, and reported both to the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) via the NHS Digital Data Security and Protection Toolkit. The first incident involved a staff member accessing the records of one of their partners' ex- wife's relatives on o ne of our clinical systems three times without a lawful reason to do so. Following an investigation the staff member was found to have committed an act of gross misconduct and the staff memb er resigned. The ICO decided that sufficient action had been taken by the Trust and no further action was required. The second incident again involved a s taff member accessing the records unlawfully this time of a partner's child where the ex-partner was withholding information on the ch ild's health from its father. Following an investigation the st aff member was dismissed su bject to appeal for gross misconduct and this was reported to the ICO. The ICO decided that the Trust had acted sufficiently and no further action would be r equired subject to the o utcome of the a ppeal. Subsequently the a ppeal was upheld and the staff member returned to work under tight supervision. The ICO has been informed of the o utcome of the app eal and the Trust is awaiting the ICO's final decision. Following these two incidents the Trust issued a reminder to all manager's to cascade to their staff about unlawful access to systems and the likely outcome of any investigation. The Trust was also the subject of one comp laint against us raised via the ICO. This was from an ex staff member who comp lained the Trust had misused an image obtained from social media by a staff member which sho wed the comp lainant in a situation which did not stand up to the complainants then status as being on long term sick leave from the Trust. Following the production of evidence to the ICO the Trust was found to have acted lawfully and the ICO closed the complaint as it was not a Data Protection comp laint but in their judgement an employment law comp laint. Annual Quality Report The directors are required und er the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Ser vice (Quality Accounts) Regulations 2010 (as amend ed) to prepare Quality Accounts for each financial year. NHS Improvement (in the exercise of powers conferred on Monitor) has issued guidance to NHS foundation trust boards on the form and content of annual Quality Reports which incorpora te the above legal requirements in the NHS Foundation Tru st Annual Reporting Manual. The Board is able to as sure itself that the Quality Report re presents a balanced view and that there are ap propriate con trols in place to ensure the acc uracy, comp leteness and timeliness of the d ata by the process detailed below. 85 Progress against the agreed priorities and indicators in the 2 018/19 Quality Report have been re ported to the Executive Quality and Clinical Risk Group, the Quality Governance Committee a nd the Trust Board, quarterly throughout the year. As part of the co nsultation for the priorities and indicators for the 2 019/20 Quality Report the Trust consulted with staff and stakeholders including through the Quality Matters Conference in Janu ary 2019 and at the Council of Governor s. Feedback from staff has informed the proposed quality priorities and i ndicators, which ha ve been pro vided to external stakeholders including the Trust's Commissioners and Healthwatch for consultation. In line with guidance, the Trust commissions external auditors to carry out an ass urance review of the Quality Report. This review includes reviewing the co ntent of the Quality Report for consistency with what has been reported intern ally to the Trust Board throughout the year, feedback from Commissioners, Governors and other external stakeholders. The Trust's External Auditors have issued an u nqualified limited a ssurance All policies and proc edures are produc ed in line with the NHS Litigation Authority requireme nts, which are still deemed to be best practic e, although the formal risk management assessments do not now take place. The effectiveness of policies in e nsuring quality of care provided is monitored through a variety of mechanisms including: as pa rt of root cause analysis, by undertaking audit, by monitoring incident and comp laint data. Should the Trust wish to explore a part icular aspect in the quality of care in more detail a focussed 'deep dive' review will be u ndertaken. The Trust wide Clinical Audit programme includes topics from priority areas such as CQC inspection reports, NICE guidance, and contractual requireme nts. The Trust audit database is a key tool in ensuring monitoring of action plans and that audit activity is effecti ve. During 2018/19 the Board has co ntinued to refine reporting thro ugh the integrated corporate dashboard. The metrics are used to populate team level dashboards. All staff have acc ess to the s ame information and insights as the Board. These metrics will be mo nitored by the Executive Quality and Clinical Risk Group. The data used to support the integrated corporate dashboard comes from various sources including clinical audits, surveys, information management systems, incident reports and intern al and external audits. All of these are used to produce the monthly Integrated Dashboard. Data in relation to performance and quality is collated a nd reviewed by the Directors of Finance, Human Resources and Nursing and Quality. These Directors are responsible for ensuring reliable information is produced on a timely basis. Review of effectiveness As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of intern al control. My review of the effecti veness of the s ystem of internal control is informed by the work of the internal auditors, clinical audit and the executive managers and clinical leads within the NHS foundation trust who have responsibility for the development and maintena nce of the internal control frame work. I have dra wn on the co ntent of the quality report attached to this Annual Report and other performance information available to me. My review is also informed by comments made by the external auditors in their management 86 letter and other reports. I have been a dvised on the implications of the result of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the Board, the a udit committee and a plan to ad dress weaknesses and e nsure continuous impro vement of the system is in place. System of Internal Control There are a number of compon ents which form our system for maintaining and reviewing the system of internal control The Trust Board The Board has overall responsibility for the activity, integr ity and strategy of the Trust. Its role is largely supervisory and strategic and has six key functions: to set strategic direction, define objectives and agree plans for the Trust to monitor performance and ensure corrective action to ens ure financial stewardsh ip to ens ure high standards of corporate and clinical governance to app oint, appraise and remun erate executives to ens ure dialogue with external bodies and the local community. Audit Committee The role of the Audit Committee is to provide the Trust Board with the assurance that adequate processes of corpor ate governanc e, risk management, audit and internal control are in place and working effectively. It oversees the estab lishme nt and maintena nce of an effective system of internal control throughout the organisation. It ensures that there are effective internal audit arrangements in place that meet mandatory NHS Internal Audit Standards and provides independent assurance to the Trust Board. The Committee reviews the work and findings of External Audit and provides a cond uit through which their findings can be co nsidered by the Trust Board. It reviews the Tru st's annual stat utory accounts before they are presented to the Trust Board, ensuring that the significance of figures, notes and important changes are fully understood. The Committee maintains oversight of the Trust's Counter Fraud arrangements. It also provides assurance over the Trust's risk process ensuring that risk is dealt with cons istently throughout the organisation. Internal Audit Internal Audit during 2018/19 was und ertaken by BDO who produce an annual intern al audit plan, produc ed in discussion with the Trust to enable high level scrutiny of the effectiveness of the processes and procedures that the Trust has in place. BDO carried out 11 reviews in 201 8/19 designed to asce rtain the e xtent to which the internal controls in the system are adequate to ensure that activities and proc edures are operating to achieve the Trust's objectives 201 8/19. The Trust Internal Auditors have conc luded that moderate assurance can be given th at there is a generally sound system of internal control, designed to meet the organisation's objectives, and that controls are generally being applied co nsistently. However, some weakness in the design and/or inconsistent application of controls , put the achievement of particular objectives at risk. Conclusion This Annual Governance Statement highlights the continuing improvements made within the Trust. No significant internal control issues have been identified during the course of the year . The Board has absolute clarity of purpose on the priority of moving the Trust's governance structures to an 'exemplary' standard and will continue to make improvements over the course of 2019/20 .

To determine our priorities for 2018/19 we held a workshop to review all the impro vement programmes underway across the Trust. We had a wealth of improvement plans to ad dress various work streams, including: National Inst itute for Health and C are Excellence quality standards and guidance Commissioning for Quality and Innovation Various nat ional accreditation awards Sign up to Safety Campaign Better Every Day Programme. There were also local impro vement plans specific to particular wards or teams, to address areas the staff wished to impro ve. We also considered themes from complaints, incident feedback from patients and staff and performance against key quality indicator s. We reviewed recomme ndations from e xternal re views such as those published by the Care Quality Commission, NHS Improvement and other national bodies. From all of the information held, we identified those areas which would have the most impact for people who us ed our services to develop our quality priorities and supporting indicator s. These were then launched at the Quality Matters Conference on 26 January 2018 and the feedback used to refine our selection, before taking the quality priorities to wider consultation with our stakeholders who had been engaged with Trust during the year. We also made the consultation available on our website to enable members of the public and other stakeholders an opportunity to express their views. The final quality priorities supported our vision to be better every day throu gh exce llence, compa ssion and expertise in a ll we do, as well as the strategic goal to provide high quality care - first time, every time. Page 9 QUALITY PRIORITIES 2018/19 We start this section by reporting on our achievements against the Trust's quality priorities we set o urselves for 2018/19. The following ta bles outline the priorities and progress over the past year. Priority 1 Pat ient Experience: To be an org anisation that involves the p atient, their families and carers Outc ome: Achieved Rationale: We wanted to make participation a reality at the Trust because it is the right thing to do, but it is also within the context of the Mazars Report, Francis Inquiry, the Keogh Mortality Review and the Berwick Review into Patient Safety reports. These all concluded that the NHS must have patients, families and local people as equal partners in care and in the design and delivery of services, and listen to their views. The NHS Constitution and section 242 of the NHS Act 2006 (as amend ed by the 2012 Health Act) includes a duty to involve pat ients in their care and the development of services. There is a proven as sociation (Coulter and Ellins 200 6) between: engagement of patients in their health, care and treatment outcom es in relation to patient reports of their experiences, and of their satisfaction with care patients' recall of information, knowledge and confidence to manage their condition likelihood of patients reporting that the chosen treatment path was appro priate for them. We wanted to build on the success of the Triangle of Care (ToC) programme, which was first introduced during 2017/18. The aim was to introduce this to our mental health inpatient and crisis services, to further enhance the experience of people who use our services and their carers. During 2018/19 we would continue to embed the ToC in our mental health inpatient a nd crisis teams whilst ro lling out to our community mental health teams. Alongside this work in mental health services, the Trust committed to sign up to the Dementia Friendly Hospital Charter in our physical health wards. The Charter sets the standards anyone with dementia or their carer can expect from any hospital. The work undertaken and quality of care provided to obtain these standards builds on the work we undertook during 2017/18 with John's Campa ign and the carer's passport in our community hospitals. The last element for this priority was to develop patient experience feedback mechanisms in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Ser vices (CAMHS) to understand and impro ve their experiences of our services. Quarter 1 Quarter 2 Quarter 3 Quarter 4 ToC programme progressed; Community hospitals signed up to National Dement ia Friendly Alliance; Baseline data collection from CAMHS comp leted. ToC training implemente (DFHC) self-assessment comp leted; Data from CAMHS used to inform the system to capture patient experience Community hospital matrons ToC training commenced; DFHC acti on plans submitted; CAMHS registered to use Gath er, the Trust's patient experience feedback software. ToC training embedded, raising awareness continues; Community Hospitals comp leted over 50% of actions; CAMHS feedback increased, over 50% of bespoke plan implemente d. Going forward: Continue to progress to the final submission for Triangle of Care Stage 2 in November 2019 Continue to support CAMHS with the implementation of a service spec ific feedback mechanism Our commu nity hospitals will continue to work with local Dementia Alliance Groups. Page 10 Priority 2 Pat ient Safety: Outc ome: To be an org anisation that creates a positive and stro ng safety culture Progre ss made Rationale: The Trust propos ed that an area which required focus and attention was when patients experienced unexpected deterioration of their physical health while in our care. When patients come into hospital they put their trust in the professionals caring for them. They assume they are being monitored and that any deterioration in their condition will be detected and acted on quickly. The rationale behind selecting this as a quality priority was as follows: There had been cases highlighted from incident investigation and audit findings where monitoring of physical health care and rapid awareness of a deteriorating patient was de layed as s taff failed to spot or act on changes in their condition The Wessex Academic Health Science Network (AHSN) (which the Trust is affiliated to) had also identified 'the deteriorating patient' as key priority so there was an opportunity to share and develop pract ice in this area at regional learning events Nationally commissioned reports. Learning from externa lly identified recommendations and a review of our incident data, the organisation recognised the need for further support and training for staff in the early detection and management of emergency situations, including choking, affecting our adult patients. Quarter 1 Quarter 2 Quarter 3 Quarter 4 Review of life support training; Commenced implement ation of International Dysphagia Diet descriptors (IDDSI); Launched National Early Warning System 2 (NEWS2); Baseline data co llection for diabetic p atients on insulin. Going forward: Rolled out IDDSI; NEWS2 communication campa ign ; Pilot self-administration of insulin using the Wessex AHSN implement ation guide. Role and l ocation specific resuscitation training implemented; IDDSI programme progressed; Roll out of the Royal College of Physicians NEWS2 online tra ining; Self-administration of insulin pilot extended to all com munity hospitals. Resuscitation training target met in Apr il 2019. IDDSI training implemente d, resources available for staff; Completion of NEWS2 online tra ining continued; Self-administration of insulin pilot continued Continue with the implementation of Resuscitation training and International Dysphagia Diet descriptors (April 2019) Continue with the implementation and raising awareness of Self-administration of insulin programme Continue with the implementation and embedding of NEWS2 into 2019/20. Page 11 Priority 3 Clinical Effectiveness: Outc ome: To be an org anisation that alth promot ion, effective preve ntative inter vention and delivers q uality standards for our patients Progre ss made Rationale: In 2018/19 we wanted to focus on the prevention of ill health and support people who access our services to adopt healthier lifestyles. Trust staff would screen adult inpatients for smoking status and offer stop smoking medication, supported by referral to Smoke Stop services for those who wished to quit. Those who were not so sure about quitting would be offered advice on ways to stop if it was appropri ate for them. Staff would screen adult patients for alcohol consumpt ion and offer advice or referral to specialist services if that was appropri ate. There are around 22,500 deaths per year which can be attributed to alcohol consumption; although people may not be dependent on alcohol, their consumpt ion puts them at risk of heart disease, liver disease, cancer, depression or accidental injury. It is proven th at identification and brief advice helps these people to reduce their weekly alcohol consumption by around 12%. Reducing regular consumption by any amount reduces the risk of ill health. We wanted to continue supporting staff who work in the mental health setting to prevent and manage potential blood clots, known as venous thromb oembo lisms. While the condition is not common in older people with mental h ealth needs, the effects can be serious, so prevention and early detection are essential. Our policies and assessme nt tools were designed for use in the physical health setting, so we needed to develop an extended screening tool that was fit for purpose and supported staff in mental health inpatient teams. The screening would be designed for patients over 65 years of age. Quarter 1 Quarter 2 Quarter 3 Quarter 4 54% of ward based staff trained to screen and deliver brief smoking advice; 44% of ward based staff trained to screen and deliver alcohol advice; Review of VTE policy and asses sment tools for inpatient mental health are as. Going forward: Review of training provision for smoking and alcohol screening to staff - adaptation of e- learning and inclusion of face-to-face sessions; Pilot of VTE full risk assessme nt tool on two wards. Gradual increase in the number of patients given 'brief' advice ar ound smoking; Trust wide thresho ld for screening of patients for drinking risk levels met; VTE screening thres hold met. Continued to meet target for both offering 'brief' advice ar ound smoking and screening for drinking levels, and offering 'brief' advice and spec ialist referral; Completed a ll VTE risk assessme nt for Q4. We will continue with Alcohol and Tobacco screening and offering 'brief' advice programme and we will liaise with Dorset Clinical Commissioning Group around 2019/20 targets. VTE risk assessment is built into DHC admission proce ss, comp letion rates to be reviewed quarterly. Page 12 QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIES 2019/20 This year, to identify the quality priorities, we continued to work with those service directo rs and leads who attended our previous workshop to review all the impro vement programmes underway in the Trust. We have a wealth of improvement plans to ad dress various work streams and are in the early stages of developing and emb edding the Quality Improvement te am and Quality Improvement approach across the Trust. The Quality Improvement programme is being designed to shift the balance to our staff and people who experience our services, to identify areas for impro vement that matter most and are locally owned. We also considered themes from comp laints, incident feedback from patients and staff and performance against key quality indicator s. We reviewed rec omme ndations from external reviews such as those published by the Care Quality Commission, NHS Improvemen t, Her Majesti es Coroner for Dorset and oth er national bodies. As part of our consultation on the priority indicators we held a focus group with the Trust's Leadership Forum to comme nt and feedback on the propos ed priorities. An online survey was launched on 24 January 2019 to gather feedback from staff and stakeholders. We also made the consultation available on o ur website to ena ble mem bers of the p ublic and other stakeholders to express their views. Attendees at the Quality Matters Conference on 31 Janu ary 2019 were asked to complete the o nline sur vey and were canvassed for their feedback to refine our selection of Quality Improvement Priorities for 2019/20. The quality priorities su pport the Trust vision to be better every day through excellence, compa ssion and expertise in a ll we do, as well as the strategic goal to provide high quality care - first time, every time. PATIENT EXPE RIENCE To be an org anisation that learns from the c aptured e xperience of patients, families a nd carers and hear the voices of those that are harder to he ar. In 201 8/19 we wanted to build on the success of introducing the Triangle of Care (ToC) into our mental health inpatient and community teams as well as the crisis services to further enhance the experience of people who use o ur services and their carers. We will continue to embed the ToC into our mental health and crisis teams whilst rolling out across all our adult services. At the Trust, we have captured patient satisfaction for several years. Although this data has been valuable in tracking trends, there has been a shift in focus to ca pturing patient experience rather than patient satisfaction. Taking this positive shift further we will endeavour to learn from those experiences so we can impro ve our ser vices. We will also focus on gaining the experiences of those p atients who do not readily give or feel able to provide feedback. PATIENT SAFETY To enable staff to proactively identify and mitigate where patients or service u sers are at risk of avoidable har m. Our patient safety priority in 201 8/19 was to be an organisation that creates a positive and s trong safety culture. We wanted to support our staff in the e arly detection and management of deterioration in adult inpatients. As a Trust we have learnt through our understanding and appreciation of national reports and learning from our own internal investigations that good chan nels of commu nication, both intern ally and externa lly with other organisations is a key requirement of patient centred c are. Page 13 Continuing with our understanding of the need and benefits of joint working we want, through additional information and education, to increase our staff's awareness of domestic abuse. We want our staff to feel supported and ena bled to act effectively and promptly in response to suspected d omestic abuse. In line with nat ional guidance we will broad ened our Suicide Prevention Strategy, for the b enefit of all people access ing our services. CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS To enable clinical staff to use their professional judgement when assessing p atients and users of services when developing personalised care plans. In 201 8/19 we focussed on the prevention of ill health and s upport people who us ed our services needed to adopt healthier lifestyles. We continued su pporting staff who worked in the mental health setting to prevent and manage potential blood clots, known as venous thrombo embolisms. This year we are going to conce ntrate further on valuing people as active part icipants and experts in the planning and management of their own hea lth and well-being. Enabling staff to ensure that their patients and ser vice user 's outcomes are de veloped to have meaning to the person in the context of their whole life. This process recognises the p erson's skills and strengths, as well as their experiences and the things that matter the most to them. We have developed an ambitious Quality Impro vement (QI) programme and QI approach across the Trust. The Trusts QI programme is be ing designed to enable our staff and peo ple who experience our services to identify areas for improvement that matter most and are locally owned. It is already starting to support them to work together to identify and address a range of quality issues, enabling creativity, innovation and learning. Page 14 QUALITY IMPROVEMENT - SIGN UP TO SAFETY CAMPAIGN The Trust committed to the NHS England 'Sign Up to Safety' campa ign in November 2014 having made the following five pledges. Put safety first A commitment to reduce avoidable harm. Continually learn Acting on the feedback from patients and constantly measuring and monitoring how safe services ar e. Be transparent with peo ple abo ut our progress to tackle patient safety issues Honest and supp ort staff to be candid with pat ients and their families if something goes wrong. Collaborative Take a leading role in s upporting local collaborative learning, so that impro vements are made across all of the local services that patients use. Supportive Help peo ple und erstand why things go wrong and how to put them right. Give staff the time and support to im prove and ce lebrate the progress. The 'Sign Up to Safety' campa ign vision brings all of the national safety work streams together under one campa ign. We developed a plan which incorporated nine 'Sign up to Safety' work streams to reduce avoidable harm and save lives. Each work stream has a nominated lead, supported by staff from a wide variety of services throu ghout the organisation. Progress against the campa ign action plan is monitored with a quarterly report sent to the Executive Quality and Clinical Risk Group. The National 'Sign Up to Safety' team disbands at the end of March 2019. We have made the decision to continue with the current work streams, as described below, under the title of 'Sign Up to Safety' as this is now embed ded and understood by staff at all levels across the organisation. The number of work streams has reduced from nine to six. Sepsis has comb ined with the Deteriorating Patient work stream to align with the Wessex Patient Safety Collaborative Network. Safe Transfer of Care and Care Planning are continuing having been incorpor ated into core bus iness. The following pages detail progress against the six work streams: Pressure ulcers Promoting positive and proactive pra ctice to reduce restrictive intervention Deteriorating pat ient and sepsis Suicide pre vention Falls prevention Safe medication. Page 15 PRESSUR E ULCERS Aim: In 201 8/19 to reduce the number of hospital-acquired avoidable inpatient pressure ulcers reported in 2017/18 by 50% and to reduce the number of commu nity-acquired avoidable press ure ulcers Year to date Hospital-acquired a voidable 1 1 0 0 2 75% Community-acquired avoidable 6 6 2 3 17 45% NB: Within Community Hospitals one ward has not had any avoidable press ure ulcers reported s ince 201 5. Three wards have not had any reported for more than two years and five wards ha ve not had any reported for over one year. Key success: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) reviews for category 3 commu nity-acquired press ure ulcer Use of a questionnaire triage proce ss has enabled and empowered te ams to identify trends and themes Improved local awareness and i ncreased e ngagement Development of more individualised acti on plans CCG assurance audit comme nced where of questionnaires are aud ited quarterly. Pressure ulcer RCA-exempt register introduced in Septemb er 2018 remo ves the requirement for patients who have a long term condition and meet specific criteria from undergoing RCA if they have repeated pressure ulcers. These patients are now directly managed by the Tissue Viability Service and District Nurse Leads. There are currently 15 patients on the exempt list and these are reviewed each quarter at an assurance panel. Comm issioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) indicator 10 - Improving the assessment of wounds Launch of revised wound assessme nt, aligned to the National Minimum Data Set for full wound assessme nts temp late on SystmOn e, our electronic patient record, is impro ving the completion of wound ass essme nts The recent audit of wound assessments (March 2019) showed 35% comp letion comp ared to Joint Wou nd Form ulary Launched Apr il 2018, four events held across the county with 300 s taff attending the drop-in sessions The Skin Tear Pathway has now been launched. This is to improve the management of skin tears and achieve better outcomes for patients. Going Forward: Continue to develop and embed the NHS Improvement plan for the re vised definition and measurement of Pressure Ulcers Pressure Ulcer discharge patient pack to be developed for patients being discharged from hospital. To raise awareness amongst patients and carers. Page 16 PROMOTING POSITIVE AND PROACTIVE PRACTICE TO REDUC E RESTRICTIVE INTERVENTION Aim: For 95% of patients experiencing seclusion, rapid tranquilisation or prone restraint to have evidence of de-escalation and debrief with full comp letion of physical observations recorded. Due to reporting changes and processes it has not been possible to report progress against this aim. The aim of the work stream will be r efreshed once guidance for the Mental Health Units (Use of Force) Act 2018 is received. Restrictive Interventions 201 8/19 Inter vention Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Total Rapid tranquilisation 55 45 81 53 234 Prone restraint 28 37 71 47 183 Seclusion 24 31 55 21 131 Q4 has seen a reduction in all forms of restrictive interventions. However, over the year period there has been an overall increase in the use of rapid tranquilisation and seclusion whilst the use of prone restraint has significantly reduced. Rapid tranquilisation has increased by 9% from 214 in 2017/18 to 233 in 2018/19. The highest number of incidents were reported by the Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) which is representative of the acuity and comp lexity of the patients. There has been an increased use of alternative injecti on sites over the last two years, which has re duced the use of prone restraint to administer rapid tranquilisation. Seclusion has increased by 15% from 114 incidents in the period April 2017-March 2018 to 131 in the same period 2018/19. Of the 131 incidents, one patient accounted for 36 episodes of seclusion. This patient had a behaviour support plan in place as it was his preference to be secluded to help him manage his risk to self and others. This was care-planned and followed by staff as the least restrictive option. Prone restraint has decreased by 21% from 232 in the period April 2017-March 2018 to 184 in the same period 2018/19. 80 incidents of prone restraint occurred on Haven Unit, which demonstrates a significant reduction from 154 incidents reported for April 2017- March 2018. Key successes: Learning Disability Services and Community Mental Health Teams joined the programme, extending the focus beyond the mental h ealth inpatient wards The Data Analysis Review Team group amalgamated with the Promoting Positive and Proactive Practice to Reduce Restrictive Interventions, chaired by the Head of Mental Health, supported by the Head of SAFE (Counter Fraud a nd Security Management Specialists) Designated ward-based lead for restrictive intervention on areas with the highest number of incidents 'Risk huddles' have had a direct impact on reducing the number of incidents. Those involve weekly review of all incidents, care plans and beh avioural support plans empo wering staff to take ownership of incidents, allowing for learning to be shared in a timely manner Prevention and Management of Violence and Aggression (PMVA) trainers providing targeted support to areas with the highest number of incidents to debrief and improve record keeping Engagement with the Mental Health Patient Safety Collaborative. Going Forward: Development of an overarching work stream action plan Review and imp lementa tion of the requirements of The Mental Health Units (Use of Force) Act 2018. Continued engagement with Safewards, a model developed nationally which is designed to reduce conflict and create a sense of safety and mutual support for patients and staff The QI, NHS Elect and Patient Safety Teams will facilitate an intern al QI Collaborative for the work stream, with two full day and two half day workshops scheduled for the year Potent ial for peer specialist workers to work with challenging patients Engagement in Quality Improvement projects in conjunction with the Mental Health Patient Safety Collaborative, supported by the Trust's Quality Improvement Team. Page 17 DETERIORATING PATIENT AND SEPS IS Aim: By May 2020, all patients under the care of the Trust who deteriorate are identified and have a timely response. The focus for 2017/18 was to determine the criteria for raising an incident report when a patient's physical health deteriorates. An incident report would be comp leted when a patient's condition unexpectedly deteriorated resulting in a transfer and admission to an acute hospital. Throughout 2018/19 this process has been embedded in practic e. 2018/19 has seen an overall increase in the number of deteriorating patient incidents reported with five wards show a significant increase. Staff report a variety of reasons for this which include a general increase in awareness raised through the implement ation of, and training in, NEWS2 combined with wider engagement throughout the organisation in the Deteriorating Patient Steering Group. Some Commu nity Hospitals report an increasing number of step-up patients being admitted who have a higher acuity on admission. There have been specific concerns raised about the quality of discharges from a particular acute hospital which has resulted in a number of patients being transferred back. Further information will be gained and assistance sought from the QI team to collect and analyse the data. Key successes: Intro duction of National Early Warning System 2 (NEWS2) March 2019 Trust overall comp liance with National Early Warning System (NEWS) audit is 95% (NB: Trust continues to use the NEWS audit while the introduction of NEWS2 continues) Royal College of Physicians NEWS2 online training ro lled out across the Trust Working with Wessex Patient Safety Collaborative Network on development of a regional NEWS2 audit. Review of patients whose physical health deteriorates or who die within 72 hours of transfer to an acute hospital Process to establish a correlation between the patient's diagnosis and identification of any intervention which may have pre vented the transfer Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) Training needs assessment survey distributed throughout the organisation Awareness raising lead by the Community Consultant Nurse Review of regional educational tools with signposting for staff. Physical Health in Severe Mental Illness Strategy Draft strategy awaiting approval. Gold Standard Framework (GSF) accreditation on two Older Persons Mental Health Wards has diminished the need for patients at the end of life transferring to an acute hospital for pain relief, as staff have und ertaken syringe driver training. Short videos where staff share experiences of sepsis. Pilot impro ving the provision of physical health assessments for patients of Community Mental Health Teams (CMHT) on antipsychotic medication. Neurological Guidance Standardisation of Neurological observation charts and development of Neurological Guidance. Going Forward: Continue to work with the Wessex Deterioration Network, Dorset CCG, Primary Care and Care Home Leads, the local acute Trusts and the ambulance service to standardise the implement ation of NEWS2 across the region Liaise with Hampsh ire CCG and Interserve to potentially introduce RESTORE2, which is aimed at recognising deterioration within a care home setting. The tool looks at the 'soft signs of deterioration', particularly effective in s ituations where patients stay for a length of time A 'Deteriorating Patient Plan' to be developed Joint review with the Mortality Governance Team where a patient's physical health deteriorates resulting in their death within 72 h ours of transferring to an ac ute hospital. Page 18 SUICIDE PREVENTION Aim: To reduce the number of suicides by 10% by the end of 2020 in line with the National Suicide Prevention Strategy. The Trust's Suicide Prevention Action Plan, which forms the overarch ing direction for this work stream, is built around the ten ways to impro ve patient safety identified by the National Confidential Enquiry into Suicide and Homicide Review of 20 years of data (published in October 2016). Key success: 1. Safer wards: Work underway to enh ance our th erapeutic observations po licy Ligature management plans comp leted for all inpatient areas, including the removal of p lastic laundry bags. 2. Dual diagnosis service A one-day skills-based training package introduced to aid recognition of dual diagnosis. 3. Low staff turnover In response to the 2017 NHS Staff Survey results, task and finish groups have been estab lished to address bullying in the workplace, staff experience of violence in the workplace and work-related stress, and to co nsider systems for managing errors and incidents. 4. Assertive outreach teams Review of rehabilitation services and the Trust's two Assertive Outreach teams led by the Director of Mental Health and Lear ning Disabilities. 5. Personalised risk management E-learning training package, containing training on risk assessment and management, with an update on learning from serious incidents produced by Patient Safety and Learning and Development teams Clinical Risk Policy revised, updated a nd approved Consultant half-day workshop dedicated to suicide risk and prevention led to amendments in risk stratification and redesign of the RiO (Trust 's electronic patient record) risk assessment form Work continues to develop 'My Wellbeing Plan' to replace the current Crisis Plan, My Crisis Plan and Care Plan. 6. Clear guidance on depression Update to the primary care protocols for management of depression and anxiety available in the Dorset Formulary Production of a patient information leaflet. 7. Family involvement in \"Learning Lessons\" Relatives bereaved by suicide are offered the opportunity to share experiences in videos which have then be made available on the intranet and incorporated into clinical risk training and team reflection sessions A 'Making Families Count' workshop and learning being shared. 8. 24-hour crisis teams The Bournemouth Retreat opened in April 2018 providing an alternat ive out-of-hours service, for people to self-refer at times of crisis, staffed by peer specialists, and registered mental health nurses Crisis Teams running an emot ional containment pathway for the east of the count y. 9. No out of area a dmissions Improving situation with the additional four beds at Forston Clinic. 10. Early follow up on discharge Seven-day follow up for all patients discharged from an inpatient psychiatric service or from Crisis / Home Treatment Team Follow-up for 'high risk' patients standardised at 48 hour s. Local additional actions Potent ial local 'hot-spots': Collaborative working with operators of the multi-storey car park in Poole Page 19 town centre has seen improvements to the infrastructure, barriers, help points upgraded with additional call points on the upper levels and vandal-proof signage sign posting to Samar itans and NHS 111. The Trust pro vides training for responding to people in crisis to car park employees. Going Forward: Continued participation in the NHS Dorset Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) Pan Dorset Suicide Prevention Strategy development and ongoing work Further develop car er involvement in the work stream Review impact of the 'Retreat' model Second 'Retreat' to open in Dorchester in spring 2019 Development of three 'Community Front Rooms' across rural Dorset, a continued expansion of crisis services Crisis Teams in the west of the county to start emotional containment Applied Suicide Inter vention Skills Training (ASSIST) for Retreat, Crisis Services, Connexion (te lephone support line) and employees of car parks in Poole Capital building projects to support 'No out-of-hours admissions' work stream with proposed development of a Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit and expansion of the mother and baby inpatient unit, plus plans to build and develop a female low secure unit, additional acute inpatient capacity at St Ann's Quality Priority for 2019/20: Embedding the Suicide Prevention Plan across the Trust, not just within Mental Health services. FALLS Aim: To reduce the number of falls resulting in moderate or minor injury by 10% annually. 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17 2017/18 2018/19 Falls resulting in fracture 33 27 15 15 Falls resulting in head injury 2 0 Inpatient falls: minor injury 491 439 392 361 368 Inpatient falls: without injury 987 876 712 734 599 Total in injury-only trajectory 466 452 438 394 Actual Total 472 419 370 383 In 201 8/19 there has been an o verall reduction of 12% in the n umber of falls reported compared to 2017/18 Based on 2017/2018 data Falls resulting in fracture have reduced by 12% Falls resulting in minor injury have increased by 2% Falls resulting in no harm have reduced by 13% 14 incidents have been reviewed at panel. 13 were found to be predictable but not preventable, one was found to be not predictable or preventable. There is one incident awaiting re view at panel, this is scheduled for panel 03/05/2019. Key successes: Multi Factorial Falls Assessment (MFFA) tool Draft electronic form has been developed for SystmOne and Rio. Learning from Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and incidents Post protocol falls flow chart simplified to clarify the proce ss. Raizer chairs In use throughout the Trust, with an additional chair available at St Ann's.

Medicines management training Significant impro vement in take up for the e-hub core medicines management training Medicines Management training has been developed for trainee nurse associates and for Band 2 community support workers. Medication safety thermomet er Template for monthly rolling audit available on SystmOne. Going Forward: Continue to drive the uptake of Self Administration of Medicines across the Trust, to include self- administration of insulin as pa rt of the Quality Priority set for 18/19. The above tables provides deta ils and data up to and including quarter 3 2018/19 Page 21 Learning from deaths In March 2017 the National Quality Board (NQB) issued a frame work for Trusts to learn from patient deaths. Learning from a review of the care provided to patients who die should be integral to clinical governance and quality impro vement work. The Trust's Mortality Governance Group, chaired by the Medical Director, has oversight of the programme. MORTALITY During 2018/19 298 of Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust's patients died. This comprised the following number of deaths which occu rred in each quarter of that reporting period: 99 in the first quarter 96 in the second quarter 103 in the third quarter 95 in the fourth quarter By 14 January 2019, 194 case record reviews and 21 investigations have been carried out in relation to 215 of the deaths included above. In 1 case a death was subjected to both a case record review and an investigation. The number of deaths in each quarter for which a case record review or an investigation was carr ied out was: 74 in the first quarter 77 in the second quarter 64 in the third quarter 61 in the fourth quarter 1 representing 0.5% of the patient deaths during the reporting period are judged to be more likely than not to ha ve been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. In relation to each quarter, this consisted of: 1 representing 1.4% for the first quarter 0 representing 0% for the second quarter 0 representing 0% for the third quarter 0 representing 0% fourth quarter These numbers have been est imated using the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) structured judgement tool of avoidability. In Quarter 4 2018/19 14 reviews were conducted for unexpected deaths. None of these unexpected deaths were judged to ha ve been avoidable using the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) Structur ed Judgement Tool. It is noteworthy that the Structured Judgement tool will no longer be used as of the year 2019/20. A summary of learning from the investigation conducted in relation to the one death judged to be avoidable using the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) structured judgement tool of avoidability are: Page 22 For the d eath where there were problems in the care provided the following learning points were identified: discuss ions had at the Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) meeting and the rationale for decisions made at the MDT me etings must be documented in the patient's electronic records discuss ions / supervision re cases between junior clinicians and Consultant Psychiatrists must be document in the p atient's clinical records the importance of written records needing to accurate ly reflect the discussions had with a patient and the importance of contemp oraneous, succinct but informative record keeping assessme nt of how a person may be considering to take their own life must be undertaken by staff and followed up with visual inspections where possible to review access a patient has to means to end their life appreciation that having ch ildren is not always a prote ctive factor in pre venting someone from taking their own life. An action plan has been produc ed to address the care and service delivery problems identified as part of the root cause analysis investigation. This included record keeping audits with exception reporting in place for care planning and risk assessme nts. These action plans are reviewed by the Executive Quality and Clinical Risk Group and progress against these are reviewed by the Qu ality Governance Committee. The actions identified aim to assist in the reduction of unwarranted variation in pract ice in the areas to provide safe and effecti ve care for patients. Page 23 CELEBRATING ACHIEVEMENT The Retreat - A Place to Pause The Retreat is one of the first deliverables of the Mental Health Acute Care Pathway review, following the feedback gathered by the review and the positive evidence demonstrated by similar schemes that are using a less medicalised model of crisis support. The Retreat is a drop-in centre that has opened at Hahnemann House and through co-produ ction ensures the needs and views of people with lived experience of mental health problems are being represented and valued in the development and delivery of the service. The Retreat provides a safe space for people who want to access su pport on their own terms; it represents a departure from traditional treatment methods, moving away from the clinical model of diagnosis and treatment, and towards one with a focus on commu nity engagement, accessibility for all, and preventative approach es. The Retreat places emph asis on self-management, relational safety, increased trust, and practic al recovery-focused approaches, while minimising clinical assessme nt and diagnosis. It is staffed by both mental health professionals and peer specialists who can offer out-of-hours support and advice. It has already se en several successes with a very positive start; one evening it had a peak of 24 attendees, with some additional family and carers. A number of attendees had previously utilised stays in inpatient and Section 136 su ites; the Retreat appears to offer people a less restrictive alternat ive. As such, a pattern of regular service users is emerging, allowing the opportunity for a supportive community network to grow; in fact, the first attendee has now become a volunteer at the Retreat. Service users and local police have both given positive feedback, with people reporting they feel listened to, welcome and relaxed, and find it helpful to ha ve a service that is immediately accessible without a referral process. Page 24 NHS 70 Parliame ntary Awards Dorset 's Armed Forces Community Health and Wellbeing Team has been presented with a top accolade at the NHS 70 Parliamentary Awards for its work in mental health. Team members strive to reduce health inequalities for local vetera ns and families of both retired and serving personnel. Working with local partners and vetera ns themselves, they have co-produc ed and implemented a veterans' care pathway, and in their first year they assessed 55 people through their Wellbeing Gate way, and demand continues to be high. Outcomes include impro ved access to physical and mental health services and support in preparing for employment. The team was nominated by Bournemouth East MP Tobias Ellwood and Mid Dorset and North Poole MP Michael Tomlinson, and was shortlisted from 7 50 entries for the awards, launched back in February 2018 to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. The team received The Excellence in Mental Health Care Award at a special ceremony at the Houses of Parliament in July 2018. Service and Clinical Lead Andy Gritt said: \"We are extreme ly humbled to have received th is award, and it is testament to the hard work and enthusiasm of the team. We are really proud to accept this honour on behalf of Dorset HealthCare and the armed forces community we serve. Research shows that for service personnel, the transition to civilian life can lead to a range of challenges including health issues, family problems, homelessness and unemployment. There's also little understanding of service families' mental health nee ds and no joined-up approach to support them, and we are actively looking to change this.\" Michael Tomlinson MP said: \"I was delighted to be able to nominate the Dorset Armed Forces Community Health and Wellbeing Team and even more pleased they won. They do a fantastic job, and I hope th at this helps to highlight the importance of mental health, which is right at the top of the p olitical agenda.\" In recognition of his tireless work to improve the lives of Dorset's military vetera ns and serving personnel, Andy Gritt, Service and Clinical Lead rec eived an MBE in the New Years' Honours List. Trust becomes a Disability Confident Emplo yer The Trust has been awarded Disability Confident Employer status, showing a commitment to improving the way we attract, recruit and retain disabled workers. The Disability Confident scheme requires organisations to submit a portfolio of evidence, detailing the various ways in which they support employees with disabilities - such as better access to buildings, training, and adjustments to the workplace or recruitment processes. There are three ac creditation levels to reach - Committed, Employer and Lea der - and, once comp leted, an official badge is awarded for use on all brand ing and marketing. We achieved the first level (Committed) around two years ago, and will now apply to become a Leader. Trust Equality and Diversity Manager Dave Corbin said: \"Becoming a Disability Confident Employer enables us to draw from the widest possible pool of talent across the country, improve employee mora le and above all, shows that we treat all of our staff fairly. Around 4% of our employees have disclosed that they have a disability - we know there are more and we don't want them to feel ashamed or worried about telling us. This work shows we are committed to moving barriers and changing culture and that we see disability as an asset, not a hindrance\". Page 25 National award for Dorset's Criminal Justice Liais on and Diversion Service An NHS team which supports people who have mental health, learning disability, substance misuse or other vulnerabilities who come into contact with the criminal justice system won a national award for patient safety. The Trust's Criminal Justice Liaison and Diversion Service (CJLD) triumphed at the Health Service Journal (HSJ) Patient Safety Awards in Manchester in July. The service set out to identify and support vulnerable memb ers of our community, initiating a model for liaison and diversion and street triage in 2014. Achievements now reflected in seven-day coverage and integrati on within criminal justice settings that have helped to influence local approach es supporting the needs of people experiencing mental health crises. Hospital-based places of safety now support people detained under Section 136 Mental Health Act with the introduction of a more effective, co-ordinated response for people in mental distress, crisis and emergency. The service has worked tirelessly in efforts not only resulting in cost savings for all agencies, but also impro ved wellbeing and recovery for those suffering mental health episodes during police custody or attendance in court. An inspection of Dorset Police custody by HM Inspector ate of Prisons, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in 2016 re ported a l arge reduction in the number of people brought into custody, and significant progress in impro ving outcomes for this vulnerable group. Judges for the Mental Health category at this year's Health Service Journal Patient Safety Awards said the CJLD service \"provides a unique and attentive approach that is forward looking in maintaining safety of a vulnerable group.\" Service Lead Stan Sadler said: \"We take gre at confidence in the knowledge that each and every one of our skilled workforce has embraced a model designed to meet the needs of some of most vulnerable people in Dorset. I am overwhelmed and so proud of this wonderful achievement, but mindful that the hard work must continue, along with the strong relationships we have built with other criminal justice organisations and the emergency services.\" The honour is further recognition for the CJLD Team, which narrowly missed out on winning the Liaison and Diversion accolade at the Howard League's 'Policing the Community' Awards last year, where it was one of only three teams shortlisted from 35 services acr oss England. Page 26 UNICEF backs our breastfeeding s ervice The United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) is helping spread the word about our pioneering initiative to encourage breas tfeeding. Our Breastfeeding Advisory Team produced a range of posters featuring local women with their babies at home, coupled with 'softer', more positive mess ages mums can relate to. Their impact has been staggering, with more than 24,300 shares within two days of their release on the Breastfeeding Network's official Facebook page, which has seen them viewed across Americ a. They've also been downloaded more than 3,000 times from our website. Breastfeeding social marketing is leading the way with support from the Instit ute of Health Visiting and U NICEF. Breastfeeding Advisory Lead Liz Stacey said: \"I have been overwhelmed by the positive feedback the posters have received. I hope they act as a catalyst for discussing any concerns a new mum may have regarding her breas tfeeding journey with a health professional.\" Liz and her team travelled to the Houses of Parliament earlier this year to present them to the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Infant Feeding and Inequalities. The posters have also been featured in recent study days held by the Institute of Health Visiting, the Royal Society for Public Health Breastfeeding, the Breastfeeding Network and the Royal Society of Medicine. They formed an integral part of the Scottish Breastfeeding Celebrations Week in the summer, and were showcased at a public health conference in Australia. Dr Cheryl Adams CBE, Executive Director at the Instit ute of Health Visiting, said: \"This is a shining example of fantastic innovation. The mess aging and images they possess are so warm and appealing, so it's not surpr ising they are having such a positive effect.\" Weymouth h onours Melcombe Day Hospital team Our Older Persons Mental Health Team, which runs Melcombe Day Hospital, received special recognition from retiring Weymouth Mayor Councillor Kevin Brookes for its work in dementia care. The team, which is based at Weymouth Community Hospital, was presented with the Ken Isaacs Memor ial Rose Bowl at a special ceremo ny in the town's Pavilion. The award - named after the former mayoral chauffeur - is presented annually to someone whose ethos, good work, endeavour and kindness has most impressed the Mayor during their year in office. Team Leader Lesley Benham MBE was the first person to receive the award when it was introduced back in 2008. The award is the team's ninth local and nat ional accolade for its work supporting local people with dementia. Page 27 Weymouth is a flagship Urg ent Treatme nt Centre Weymouth Community Hospital has been designated to run one of the first 150 NHS Urgent Treatment Centres (UTCs) operating across the country. The service continues to provide all of the walk-in care which was available at the hospital's Urgent Care Centre, dealing with a range of non-life threatening minor ailments and injuries. However, local people will soon be able book a UTC appointment via local GP pract ices and the NHS 111 service, meaning they can be seen more quickly. The UTC is open 8am-8pm, seven days a week, and is run in partnership with Dorset County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and local GPs. Helen Persey, Head of Integrated Community Services (West), said: \"We are delighted Weymouth has been ch osen as one of the first 150 Urgent Treatment Centres in t he country. We are already offering mo st of the services the Governme nt expects from a UTC, so this is the logical next step. It will continue our work to bring care closer to home and reduce waiting times.\" End-of-life care accolade for Dorset ment al health wards Two wards at Alderney Hospital in Poole have led the way in helping elderly dementia patients spend their final days in dignity and peace. Staff working on Herm and St. Brelades wards were awarded Gold Standard Frame work (GSF) accreditation; making them the first older people's mental health units in the country to earn the status. The GSF is the UK's leading training provider for frontline staff working in end of life care, and has commended Alderney and other hospitals run by Dorset HealthCare for making a \"huge difference\" to the lives of patients and their families. Herm and St Brelades staff look after people with dementia who are nearing the end of their lives. Having comp leted the GSF Community Hospitals Training Programme, they were assessed by a panel of independent experts. The panel found that not only did patients receive the care they wanted, where they wanted it, but also that relatives had peace of mind and staff an increas ed sense of job satisfaction. Page 28 Clinical Team Lead Rachel Hewitt said: \"As a result of conversations with families, our approach is a lot more personal. This means the patient experience is better and loved ones feel much more supported through the whole process. Staff also feel more confident and have a better understanding of the human side of dying. When deaths do occur on the wards it's not as distressing, and we feel we have done everything possible to provide th at person with a comfortable, peaceful and pain-free d eath.\" Herm Ward Manager Chris Clarke added: \"Since we started the GSF programme, not a single patient has been transferred to an acute hospital to die. In fact, we are now able to offer patients and their families a range of options in line with their wishes, whether to stay here, go into a care home or go to their own home to die.\" Earlier in the year, Hanham Ward at Wimborne and Radipole Ward at Weymouth's and Sherborne h ospitals have all achieved G SF status over the last couple of years. GSF National Clinical Director Professor Keri Thomas said: \"Community hospitals in Dorset are making a huge difference to the lives of patients and their families. There is no greater service they can provide than supporting people every step of the way along this difficult journey. Through dedicated, planned and coordinated care, these wards are ensuring more people are living and dying acc ording to their wishes.\" Page 29 DUTY OF CANDOUR Candour was defined in Robert Francis' report as: \"The volunteering of all relevant information to persons who have or may have been h armed by the provision of services, whether or not the information has been requested and whether or not a comp laint or a report about that provision has been made.\" The Duty of Candour is a legal duty on hospital, community and mental health Trusts to inform and apologise to patients if there have been mistakes in their care that have led to significant harm. Health professionals must be open and hon est with patients when things go wrong. As a Trust we are c ommitted to being open with pat ients and carers when events such as these occur so that we gain a shared understanding of what happened, and what we can do to prevent it from happening again. 'Being Open' involves ac knowledging th at someth ing has gone wrong and cond ucting a thorough investigation into the patient safety event. We always work to assure patients, their families and carers that lessons learned will help prevent the patient safety event recurring. Duty of Candour has been integrated into the Root Cause Analysis and pressure ulcer training packages. An animated video explaining the importance of saying sorry and outlining the steps required to fulfil the requireme nts under Duty of Candour has been produced and is available on the intranet to support staff. The Patient Safety Team and Ser ious Incident Team support clinical staff by providing support, advice and guidance. The Trust 's behaviours and values are those that promote a culture of openness and transparency. These values are reflected throughout training pro vided. All patient safety incidents reported that result in moderate harm or above are investigated and the investigation process i ncludes involvement of the patient and carers where poss ible. In those incidents where Duty of Candour has been identified due to an act or omission by the Trust, the locality managers have a responsibility to manage the Duty of Candour process and ens ure the proce ss is carried out in line with the prescribed steps. They are also responsible for liaising with pat ients / service users and their family and confirming what action is being taken. The Director of Nursing, Therapies and Quality is responsible for ensuring that duty of candour is identified appropriately and the locality managers are responsible for oversee ing th at this has happened in pra ctice. Consideration is given to whether the duty of candour applies for all seri ous incidents reviewed by the Serious Incident Panel and Op erational Pressure Ulcer Panel. The Trust encourages the involvement of patients and carers in reviewing incidents in line with 'Being Open' and the Medical Director and Director of Nursing, Therapies and Quality contact families and GPs following suicides and unexpected d eaths offering input into the review process. If involvement is declined and following investigation it is apparent that the Duty of Candour applies, the family/patient are contacted and informed of the outcome of the investigation. The table below shows the number of times and types of incidents where the Trust has applied the Duty of Candour.

Ahead of such legislation, NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts are asked to provide details of ways in which staff can speak up (including how feedback is given to those who speak up), and how they ensure staff who do sp eak up do not suffer detriment. This disclosure shou ld explain the different ways in which staff can speak up if they have concerns over quality of care, patient safety or bullying and harassment within the Trust. In April 2017 Cara Southgate, Deputy Director of Nursing, Therapies and Quality was appointed as the Freedom to Sp eak Up (FTSU) Guardian. Six associate guardians have been subse quently been appointed to support this role. The Associate Guardians are from a variety of services and backgroun ds and have all had training through the National Guardians Office. The Guardian reports to the Chief Executive and there is a ded icated Non-Executive Director a nd Executive Director to support 'Speaking Up'. In addition to the FTSU guardian all staff are encouraged to contact, in the first instance, their line manager or human resources advisor or a union re presentative dep ending on the type of concern. Concerns relating to patient safety and bullying and harassme nt have all been raised to the FTSU guardian in 2018/19. A total of 68 contacts have been ma de from 1 April 2018 until 31 March 2019. Most contacts to the FTSU guardian are by email or phone as these are shared widely across the organisation in posters, leaflets, on the intranet and through contact during raising awareness sessions or attending team meetings. Once a contact is made this is logged and agreed with the individual the next steps. A letter confirming this is sent to the individual. The freedom to speak up: raising concerns (whistleblowing) policy outlines how staff raising concern will be protect ed against detriment and support and advice is given to any individual who sa ys they consider they have suffered d etriment. Feedback is given to individuals and, if a formal investigation commissioned and a report has been drafted, where poss ible this is shared with the individuals. Feedback is also asked of those who ra ise con cerns and about their experience. Page 31 STATEMENT OF ASSURANCE FROM THE BOARD Mandatory Stateme nt One: During 2018/19 the Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust provided and/or sub- contracted 1 07 relevant health services. The Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust has reviewed all the data available to them on the quality of care in 107 of these relevant health services. The income generated by the relevant health services reviewed in 2018/19 represents 91.78 percent of the total income generated from the provision of relevant health services by the Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust for 2018/19. Review of Services Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust is responsible for community and mental health services across Bournemouth, Poole and Dorset. The Trust also provides Steps to Wellbeing services in Southampton. The Trust serves a population in excess of 787,000 people, employing some 5,793 substantive staff with an income of \u00a3266,093,825 (versus \u00a3246,622,000 in 2017/18) Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust provides 107 services which are listed on our website and has reviewed them in the following ways: The Board The Board receives a monthly integrated corporate dashboard which sets out performance across a range of quality metrics under the domains of safe, effecti ve, caring, well-led and responsive. The dashboard includes exception reports where further information is provided to explain performance and actions being taken to impro ve the position. The Board also receives annual reports in respect of patient experience, complaints, safeguarding and infection prevention and control. The Board receives a patient story at each meeting. The Qu ality Governance Committee The Quality Governance Committee, which meets every other month, receives reports on: Serious incidents requiring investigation Progress with recomme ndations following review of serious incidents requiring investigation Inpatient staffing level ass urance. The Audit Committee The purpose of the Committee is to acquire and scruti nise assurances during the year as to the integrity of the Trust's principal disclosure statements, including financial statements. This is carried out by scruti nising assuranc es on the design and operation of controls. The Committee will acquire and scrutinise assurances relating to the following: Annual Governance Statement relating to the system of intern al control, which may include letters of representation Annual Report and Accounts, with accou nting policies, and Notes to the Accounts Compliance with the Trust Licence and, in particular, the Corporate Governance Stateme nt Annual disclosures in relation to the Code of Governance for NHS Foundation Trusts To set and agree the internal audit plan and review the findings and recommendations of the reports received. Page 32 Mental Health Legislation Assurance Committee The Committee, which meets quarterly, is the specialist arm of the Quality Governance Committee. The Committee receives a quarterly dashboard on Mental Health Act compliance metrics. Executive Quality & Clinical Risk Group The monthly meeting of the Group receives reports on: Moderate, major and catastrophic incidents A summary of reviewed seri ous incidents, falls and press ure ulcers A staffing level assurance report Clinical risks Mortality governance Clinical audit plan pr ogress. Director Visits Underpinning the formal reporting to groups is a system of director visits to Trust services and sit es. Information relating to patient experience Regular performance reports to the Trust Board incorporating measures on patient experience including: percentage of patients that felt safe, Friends and Family Test (FFT) scores, compliments and complaints. Reports to the Board, Quality Governance Committee, Executive Quality and Clinical Risk Group: National and local service user survey results Real time feedback Quarterly Patient Experience report Quarterly Complaints Board report (available on the Trust website) Annual comp liments and comp laints reporting including lessons learnt (available on the Trust website). In addition the Trust Non-Executive Directo rs have undertaken a comb ination of announced and unannounce d visits to the wards and units. The Trust continues to use Quality of Interaction Schedule (QUIS) (Dean, Proudfoot & Lindesay 1993), a well-regarded observational technique to capture patient experience. QUIS pioneered by the Patient Association is a system atic way of observing the quality of interactions of care between staff and patients. It is an additional way of capturing patient experience, pioneered to understand the care experiences of people who are unable to tell us themselves. Observations are recorded if the interaction was positive, basic care / neutral care or negative care. Feedback is given directly to the manager at the time of observation. The observations are carried out for a 40 minute period. Feedback overall is collated and a written acc ount is produced to share with staff and wider to see if there is any further learning. Information relating to patient safety A range of reports are sent to the Board, Quality Governance Committee, Executive Quality and Clinical Risk Group, including; Incident report included within the monthly directorate reports Moderate H arm and Above Incidents monthly report Early Warning Trigger Tool (EWTT) and Quality, Effectiveness a nd Safety Trigger Tool (QuEST) reports Central Alerting System comp liance reports Safety Thermom eter reports Quarterly report of serious incident recomme ndations and progress Quarterly safeguarding children a nd vulnerable adu lt report Page 33 National Reporting and Learning Service six-monthly incident report Quarterly and Annual Sign Up To Safety reports Clinical Risks.

Audits reports and action plans will also be shared with other a ppropriate groups as appropriate to maximise shared learning opportunities. Page 37 PARTICIPATION IN CLINICAL RESEARCH Mandatory Stateme nt Three: The number of patients recei ving relevant health services provided or sub-contracted by Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust in 2018/19 that were recruited during that period to participate in research approved by a Research Ethics Committee was 718. Our research and development function has continued to promote participation in clinical research during 2018/19, great ly expanding the c omplexity of the research undertaken and increas ing the areas of the Tru st engaging in research activity. Research helps the NHS to impro ve the quality of care and the future health of the population. The continued participation and expansion in clinical research demonstrates the Trust's commitment to impro ve the quality of care offered to patients, carers and staff in the services we provide. This year we have developed the comp lexity of our research activity taking on more complex interventional studies and expanding into a number of new areas. These include cognitive stimulation for those with intellectual disabilities and dementia, lifestyle and wellbeing in mental health and treating specific phobias in children and young people. This has occurred alongside further research in the areas of dement ia looking at detecting genetic susceptibility in late onset dementia, and in mental health looking at the prevalence of pathogenic antibodies in psychosis. A particular area we have developed during 2018/19 is our Impro ving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services. Research studies looking at the addition of, digitally delivered interventions via apps and mindfulness to treatment as usual are examples of work carried out. We have also participated in research looking at the wellbeing of staff both at a survey and interventional level. An example being Mindshine 3, a study which examined the b enefits and differences of two online interventions for staff wellbeing. We successfully hosted our first commerci al research study in 2017 with a study recru itment duration of two years and which closed to recruitment in December 2018 , with all randomised p articipants now in follow-up. The Trust has opened three other commerc ial studies in the areas of: antipsychotic reduction and discontinuation; treatment-resistant depress ion, and the investigation of the comp arative effectiveness of two medicinal products in agitation in dementia. We have submitted two other express ions of interest to participate in commercial research and we hope to be successful in being chosen to run these during 2019 /20. The Trust has continued to support non-portfolio research led by its own staff and those on placement with us in addition to the studies adopted on to the National Instit ute for Health Research (NIHR) portfolio. This investment and support has enabled staff to develop both their interest and skills in the development and delivery of research. It has also created a greater number of opportunities for patients, carers and staff to join in r esearch. Examples of the types of studies are: development, usability and acceptability of an informed choice tool on cervical screening for women diagnosed with a serious mental illness diabetic foot risk: foot deformity - its definition and current assessment by Podiatrists looking at and understanding social situations in Borderl ine Persona lity Disorder tools to measure organisational culture in English NHS Hospitals, what is current practic e? an exploration of practitioner perspectives on me ntal health ser vice user involvement in trial Liaison a nd Diversion ser vices in England. This expansion has been mirrored by the continued embed ding of strong research governance systems within the Trust which, following intern al audit of the research function, was judged to provide substantial assurance to the Trust. Collaborative working in clinical research The Trust views collaboration with other organisations in the research field as essential to increasing the opportunities for patients and carers to participate in research and for staff to gain experience of research. In light of this we work in collaboration with other NHS Trusts, Dorset CCG , Primary Care and Page 38 Bournemouth University to develop Dorset as an attractive area to carry out research and to prom ote opportunities for research acro ss the p atient pathway and bet ween organisations. Within Wessex we have worked closely with other Mental Health / Community providers, such as Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust and Solent NHS Trust, on research studies which have involved more than 350 peo ple. We have maintained our links with national research centres such as Kings College London and the Maudesley Hospital expanding the range of research that can be accessed by those who use our services, examples being: Home-based Extended Rehabilitation for Older people (HERO) Randomised Control Trial of COPe-support online res ource for carers of those with Bi-Polar disorder Treatment of adolescent anxiety disorders: the views of clinicians. We have expanded the number of universiti es we collaborate with in research projects, adding the universiti es of Reading, St George's London, Cardiff and Birmingham to already estab lished links with the universiti es of Manchester, Oxford, Sussex, Newcastle, Nottingham and University College London. Allied to this we have maintained our close links with NHS organisations in Dorset to explore opportunities to do research through the Research active Dorset initiative. We have also expanded our area of activity to join studies being led by other NHS Trusts, examples being Leeds & York Partnership NHS Trust, Bradford Teaching Hospital NHS Trust, and University Hospital Southampto n. We continue to have close links with Bournemouth University and staff collaborate in research with academic staff at Bournemouth such as genetic counselling in psychiatric disorders and Effects of Depression on Counterfactual thinking. This year also saw the first match -funded PHD studentship estab lished between the Trust and the University in the area of identifying contractures. The Trust and Bournemouth University have collaborated on a grant application to the research for patient benefit fund investigating the area of \"The effect of vegetable oil on cognitive functions in Mild Cognitive Impairment patients\" and the study has been a warded N HS Ethics we hope to hear about the o utcome e arly in 201 9. National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) interns hips Two memb ers of Trust staff have comp leted research development internships. One st aff member working with Southampton University in the area of loneliness and frailty said of her experience: \"Undertaking an interns hip gave me protected time away from my clinical hours to develop my research skills which has benefited both patients and colleagues. I was able to comp lete a postgraduate module on research methods for evidence based practice at Southampton University; this developed my skills in exploring the evidence and deciding how to apply to it to practice to ensure that I am providing the best care for my patients.\" The second staff memb er worked with colleagues at Bournemouth University on the use of therapeutic touch in fibromyalgia and spoke about the value of her experience. \"This provided me with the funds to back fill my c linical role, a day a week for 6 months, in order that I could take part in research skills development.\" In 2018/19 another member of staff has applied for an internsh ip looking at: what is the effecti veness of an \"early supported d ischarge service\" in expediting recovery and reducing length of stay. We also ensure regular participation in and support of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Wessex team and its functions supporting res earch acr oss the Wessex region. Research stu dies During 2018/19 the Trust participated in 28 research studies, both portfolio and non-portfolio studies, and a total of 723 participants across both types of studies. We publish our performance in research on our website quarterly in line with Governme nt guidance. We have recru ited 723 participants into NIHR portfolio research studies. We also achieved for the first time the threshold to receive Research Capability Funding (RCF), which reflects successful recruitment above 500 participants to NIHR portfolio studies within the specified window. Equally as important as the numbers recruited is the comp lexity of the research the Page 39 Trust can support. In 2018/19 the complexity weighting target set by the NIHR of 1709 was surpassed reaching a score of 3591.5. Our performance in successfully increas ing our performance in R&D year-on- year has led to increa sed resources being invested from the NIHR, commercial research sponsors and through the RCF, and this enables us to build capacity to de liver research. Develop the Trust's Research Governance and Adminis tration Processes The Trust has built capacity in-house to be able to provide governance and assurance over research activity taking place in the Trust, something previously contracted out to Salisbury NHS Trust. Trust staff attended training provided by the national body in research and its delivery within the NHS from the administration and governance point of view. Another staff member attended a course on the archiving of research data in line with best practice and amended the Trust Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in line with this training. A full range of SOPs have been written to support the delivery of research within the Trust and, over the last twelve months, specific SOPs associated with commercial trials research have been added to ensure clear process es and procedures are in place. All of this work was recognised when intern al audit carried out an audit of the R&D team's process es and concluded that the Board could take substantial assurance in this area. This improved overall performance in delivering clinical studies led to an award from NIHR Wessex for outstanding contribution to clinical research studies for a member of the team. Going forward We have maintained moment um and enth usiasm for clinical research and the p lan is to cont inue to develop our clinical research activity and capacity. Now that commercial research has started we will expand our commercial research portfolio in the comi ng year. The income generated from commercial research activity will hasten our growth of our research capacity and greatly increase the opportunity for patients and carers to participate in clinical research within our services. A revised Trust Research plan covering 2019/2022 will be developed in the comi ng year. This will refresh the research aims and the objectives of the Trust with a focus on increa sing research activity across more services by more staff, thus enabling more patients, carers and staff to access and benefit from quality research. Page 40 Mandatory Stateme nt Four: A proportion of Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust income in 2018/19 was conditional upon achieving quality impro vement and innovation goals agreed between Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust and any person or body they entered into a contract, agreement or arran gement with for the provision of relevant health services, through the Comm issioning for Quality and Innovation p ayment fram ework. Further details of the agreed goals for 2018/19 and for the following 12 month period are available electro nically at: https://www.england.nhs. uk/nhs-standard-contract/cquin/cquin-17-19/ The design of the 2017/19 scheme continues to support the ambitions of the Five Year Forward View (FYFV) and is directly linked to NHS Mandate with a focus on the two areas of clinical quality and transformation indicators and supporting local areas with Sustainability and Transformational Plans (STPs) and local financial sustainability. A propor tion of the Trust's income in the 12 months ending 31 March 2019 was conditional on achieving quality impro vement and innovation goals agreed with Dorset CCG though the CQUIN frame work. The total value of schemes reported during 2017/18 was \u00a35.1m. The monetary total income conditional upon ac hieving CQUIN goals for 2018/19 is \u00a35.55 million, which included co ntractual arrangements with: Dorset Clinical Commissioning Gro up (CCG) NHS England Specialised Commissioning NHS England Dental NHS England Public Health. Of the 13 n ational Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUINs), seven indicators apply to a community and mental health provider. Commissioners advised in quarter 4 2017/18 that CQUIN indicator 8 'Supporting proactive and s afe discharge' was no longer applicable or reportable. The table below lists the seven national applicable CQUIN s: CQUIN Indicator number CQUIN Indicator 1 Impro ving staff health and wellbeing 1a Improvement of health and wellbeing of NHS staff 1b Healthy food for NHS staff, visitors and patients 3 Impro ving p hysical healthcare to reduce premature mortality in pe ople with serious ment al illness (PSMI) and collaboration with primary care clinicia ns 3a Cardio metabolic assessment and treatment for patients with psychoses 3b Collaboration with primary care clinicians 4 Impro ving s ervices for people with ment al health needs who present to A&E 5 Transitions out of children and young p eople's me ntal health services 9 Preventing ill health by risky behaviours - alcohol and tobacco 10 Impro ving the assessment of wounds 11 Personalised care and support planning Dorset CCG has acknowledged, local and national challenges associated with the 2017/19 CQUIN programme. These include: CQUIN 1a - An ambitious target for the Trust to achieve further improvement from a solid performance CQUIN 1b - Data co llection difficulties associated with incapable software systems CQUIN 3a, 3b, 5, 11 - Where the target groups are small and / or the indicator is nationally recognised as cha llenging Page 41 CQUIN 9 - Requires a Pan Dorset approach with Dorset CCG and Public Health Dorset looking at 'Prevention at Scale'. Mandatory Stateme nt with Quality Comm ission (CQC) Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust is required to regist er with the Care Quality Comm ission a nd its current registration status is 'without restrictive conditions'. Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust has the following conditions on registration 'licensed to provide the following reg ulated activities': Personal care Termination of pregnancies Family planning Treatme nt of disease, disord er or injury Assessment or medic al treatment for persons detained un der the Mental Health Act 1983 Surgical procedures Diagnostic and screening proc edures The Care Quality Commission has not taken enforcement action against Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust during 2 018/19. The Trust's overall rating by the CQC is 'good'. The CQC award ratings based on a comb ination of what they find at inspection, what people tell them, data they collect and local information provided by the Trust. The ratings are awarded on a four point scale: CQC Ratings Outstanding The service is p erforming exceptionally well. Good The service is p erforming well and meeting expectations. Requires improv ement The service is n ot performing as well as it should and the CQC have told the service how it must improve. Inadequate The service is p erforming badly and action is taken against the person or organisation that runs it. CQC use five key questions in their assessment of quality each one having equal weight. A rating is awarded for each question and our overall rating for each one is shown below. Domain Overall Rating RAG Are services s afe? Requires impro vement Are services effective? Good Are services car ing? Good Are services responsive Good Are services well-led? Good During 2017/18 CQC changed the way they carry out inspections now that all Trusts have received a compre hensive inspection. Using information gathered from external data sources, and data submitted by the Trust, CQC will inspect certain core services followed by an inspection of 'well-led' at trust level. It is Page 42 intend ed this will be an annual process and selected core services will be inspected against the five domains of quality. In November 2017, the CQC ca rried out planned inspections of eight core services are as: Acute wards for adults of working age and Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) Crisis and hea lth based place of safety (HBPoS) Learning disability services Community-based mental health services for adults of working age (Adult CMHT) Community-based mental health services for older people (CMHT OP) Community health inpatient services Community health services for children, young people and families End of life care services. The inspection of core services was followed by the well-led inspection which took place from 4 to 8 December 2017. The final report was published on 13 April 2018 which confirmed the Trust 's overall rating had impro ved from 'requires improvement' to 'good'. The table on the next page shows the ratings by domain for each core service as well as their overall rating.

Communication across the Trust had impro ved with the Board and senior managers being more visible to staff. There was noticeable impro vement in the culture across the Trust, with increased openness and transparency and a clear desire in staff at all levels to learn and impro ve. The CQC report states that the Trust's senior leadership team have the skills, knowledge, experience and integr ity necessary for successfully oversee ing a large, comp lex organisation. They saw evidence of excellent leadersh ip at all levels across the Trust with many dedicated, compass ionate staff who strive to deliver the very best care for patients. The inspectors saw a clear focus on supporting both the physical and mental health of patients, regardless of whether the service they were accessing was primar ily for their physical or mental health needs. Staff found innovative ways to ena ble peo ple to manage th eir own hea lth and care. Pebble Lodge, the child and adolescent mental health ward, was noted as having met all the requiremen ts from the last inspection and the staff had gone above and beyond what was required in making the changes. There was a strong emphas is on young people being part of the community. They raised money for a chosen charity each month and the work they had done with this allowed them to volunteer at certain sites such as a farm. There were universally positive reports about the staff from both children and their parents or carers. Many staff who spoke with the CQC inspectors expressed pride in working for the Trust and felt they are valued and able to raise concerns freely and without fear of retribution in what they felt is an atmosphere of openness. Staff reported that the Trust has developed a culture of learning and improvement without apportioning blame. There were effective governance systems and processes in place to monitor risk and assure performance and quality across all levels of the o rganisation. Identified and pote ntial risks were taken into account when planning and operating services. Managers at every level of the Trust were able to access a good range of up-to-date, detailed, service- specific information and data. The electronic dashboard system allowed managers to see a spread of critical key performance indicators, which supported them in running their services. A newly revised and impro ved 'integrated corporate dashboard' gave Board members an appropriate level of accessible and pertinent detail about all areas of Trust performance, to allow them to make fully informed decisions. We saw how non-executive directors gave appropri ate scrutiny and challenge, during Board meetings, of the information presented through the dashboard. The Trust had a clear focus on co ntinuous learning and a well-developed programme of improvement and innovation. Services across the Trust had achieved accred itation in their fields or were working towards gaining such accreditation. There was a commitment from the senior team to learn from serious incidents, including deaths, and openness in the manner in which the Trust communicated with families, staff and external agencies following incidents. Areas to impro ve The safe domain is rated as 'requires impro vement' because CQC found that theatres at some of our community hospitals were not using the World Health Organisation's checklist before surgery. Safety of the environment on some mental health wards rema ined an issue and CQC had concerns in relation to the governance and capacity of the county-wide section 136 service. The inspectors felt that there was insufficient staff and capac ity to manage more than one or two patients detained on section 136 without using rooms not designed for the purpose. Staffing vacancies at some of the services were felt to have contributed to higher staff caseloads for a small number of specialist community mental health services. This meant that long waiting times from assessme nt to treatment continued to occur. Access to some specialist treatments such as speech and language therapy was, on occasion, delayed due to staff shortages in the community mental health Page 45 services for people with learning disabilities or autism. The CQC felt there was a lack of therapeutic input on one of the acute mental health wards. While the wards had a good timetable of activities, the activities available were generally recreat ional and did not support patients' re covery to their fullest potential. The inspectors found variation in the quality of care plans and patient records across services. Care plans at some of the services inspected contained insufficient patient information, while others were not written in a sufficiently person-centred style to reflect the involvement of patients in planning th eir own car e. CQC reported concerns over the way serious incidents are investigated and thought there was a lack of consistency in the document ation of investigations into serious incidents. While some investigations had identified clear root causes to incidents and then appropri ate learning drawn from detailed recommendations, other investigations had not. The Trust reviews these incidents at a weekly serious incident panel which is jointly chaired by the Director of Nursing, Therapies and Quality and the Medical Directo r. The team involved in the incident attend the panels where the investigation findings and the learning are discuss ed. These meetings are not minuted to enable participants to feel they can speak freely. Staff across the organisation reported to the inspection team that there is openness and transparency about safety and continual learning is encouraged. Staff reported that they felt supported to report incidents and near misses. The CQC found th at there were breach es of three regulations in four core ser vices, resulting in nine acti ons that we must take and 36 actions we should take. The 'should do' recommendations are areas for impro vement but do not represent a breach in regulations. The 'must do' actions related to: 1. Community health inpatient services 2. Acute wards for adults of working age and PICU 3. Mental health crisis services and H BPoS 4. Specialist community based me ntal health services for children and young peo ple. Actions in response to Care Quality Comm ission findings The core service areas with identified 'must do' and 'should do' actions have implemented action plans to address the requireme nts and recommendations made by the CQC. These action plans are monitored both internally and at the quarterly engagement meetings with the CQC. Page 46 Mandatory Stateme nt Seven: Registration with the Care Quality Comm ission Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust has participated in special reviews or investigations by the Care Quality Comm ission rel ating to the following areas d uring 2018/19 In May 2018, Ofsted, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), HMI Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) and HMI Probation (HMIP) undertook a joint inspection of the multi-agency response to child sexual exploitation, children associated with gangs and at risk of exploitation and children missing from home, care or education in Dorset. This included a 'deep dive' focus on the response to children experiencing these vulnerabilities. Key partners involved in the inspection scope and response were Dorset County Council; Dorset Clinical Service; Dorset, Rehabilitation Programme; National Probation Service; Dorset HealthCare; Dorset County Hospital and drug and a lcohol service pr oviders. The findings of the inspection were published by letter on 9 July 2018 (available in full at https://www.gov.uk/governme nt/publications/joint-inspections-of-child-sexual-exploitation-and-missing- children). In response to the three priority acti ons identified (two specific to Dorset County Council and one for the multi-agency partnership) a multi-agency written st ateme nt of action was subm itted. A number of areas of good pra ctice with relevance to Dorset HealthCare were identified, including: Multi-agency working in the mu lti-agency safeguarding hub (MASH) Partner agency support for Dorset's Family Partnership Zon es Attendance at multi-agency meetings to review high risk children a nd young people The innovative looked after children's nursing team model including specifically the co-location, enhanced offer, prompt action and positive feedback received The specialist support for vulnerable young people including sexual health's targeted outreach team and school nursing's Chat Health service, with effective identification of sexual exploitation and prompt referral for multi-agency action. A number of suggested areas for improvement are relevant to Dorset Healthcare services, including: Reducing delays in information sharing due to the use of different IT systems across health agencies Improving the ability of safeguarding leaders and managers to track the impact of actions or emerging trends through use of 'flags' in patient records for the use of the shortened sexual exploitation risk assessme nt tool Enabling managers to support challenge and learn from practice to ensure that services make best use of chrono logies, recognise culture and diversity and escalate prom ptly issues that require multi-agency action Involvement of CAMHS in coord inated risk assessment and planning across the partnership Ensuring th at school nurses receive information on children who may be in need. Review of safeguarding children and services for looked after children In October 2018, the CQC conducted a review of safeguarding children and services for looked after children. The review focused on the quality of health services for looked after children, and the effectiveness of safeguarding arrangements for all children within the boundaries of Bournemouth. The aim of the review was to evaluate the experiences and outcomes for children, young people and their families who rec eive hea lth ser vices. The findings of the inspection were published by letter on 12 February 2019 https://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/d efault/files/201 90212_clas_bournemouth_final_repor t.pdf Thematic review of the use of restr aint, prolonged seclusion and segregation in settings for people who may have me ntal health problems, a learning disability and / or autism Page 47 In January 2019 the Secret ary of State asked the Care Quality Commission to review and make recommendations about the use of force and restrictive interventions in settings that provide inpatient and residential care for people with mental health problems, a l earning disability and / or autism. Pebble Lodge, the child and adolescent mental health ward, was asked to release information to help the CQC with the first phase of its review which focuses on settings for children and young people and people of all ages with a learning disability. The information will play a key role in helping the review team understand the current use of restraint, seclusion and segregation and will inform site activity. The information request will also be shared with the analytical team and will be used to inform the national report of our key findings and recommendations, which will be p ublished after the reviews are completed. Elimination of Dormitories / shared be drooms within mental health services In January 2019 the CQC undertook a piece of work to scope the number of mental health services across the country that had dormitories / shared bedrooms in use within inpatient services. The Trust was asked to check the data held by the CQC. Our response confirmed we had three wards with double rooms, totalling 26 b eds and one ward with three d ormitories totalling 12 beds. We continue to identify options that support the mental health inpatient service in its priority to move to single acc ommodation. Working is ongoing to: explore options to increase overall capacity to reduce dormitories which have included extending two wards review our estate county-wide, refreshing on an assessme nt carried out in 2016 enter into conversations with acute hospital colleagues with regards to alternative sites undertake a review and consultation of mental health rehabilitation provision to explore a variety of different options. The outcome of this review will resolve the sh aring of rooms. Page 48 STAFF SURVEY Each year NHS staff are offered the opportunity to give their views on the range of their experience at work by comp leting a staff survey questionnaire. In 2018 the questions were grouped around 10 themes summarised from 98 questions. This is a change from the 2017 results structure, though the historic al results have been r ecalculated to illustrate year-on-year changes. The 10 themes are: Equality, diversity, and inclusion Health & wellbeing Immediate managers Morale Quality of appraisals Safe environment - bullying and harassment Safe environment - violence Safety culture Staff engagement. In the 2018 staff survey, seven of the 10 themes had scores of above average comp ared to similar NHS organisations. There is an impro vement in two themes: safe environment - violence, and safety culture. The equality, diversity and inclusion theme is scoring at the highest level within the benchmark group. The results are static for quality of appraisals and safe working environment - bullying. Results have declined for quality of care, immediate managers, and health and wellbeing. Our overall staff engagement score has rema ined static at 7.3, though this is at the highest level within the benchmark group. Our response rate in 2018 also im proved to 51.6% from 49.3% in 2017. None of the changes in theme score are statistically significant. Improvements of 2% or more for specific questions, compared to 2017 scores, are: The opportunities for flexible working patterns My appraisal left me feeling th at my work is valued by my organisation My organisation treats staff who are involved in an error, near miss or incident fairly My organisation encourages us to report error s, near misses and incidents We are given feedback about changes made in response to reported errors, near misses and incidents I would feel secure raising co ncerns about unsafe clinical pract ice I am confident that my organisation would address my concerns about unsafe clinical practice I would recommend my organisation as a place to work The extent to which my organisation values my work Opportunities for flexible working patterns I receive regular updates on patient / service user experience feedback in my directorate / department. Areas which demo nstrate further action to be taken ar e: Quality of appraisals rema ined static at 5.4, lower than the benchmark average of 5.5, with particular emphas is on not contributing to agreeing clear work objectives Immediate managers' scores have declined in all six of the questions, although the scores remain above or similar to the benchma rk average. Overall, the survey shows results as fairly static. It highlights important areas where staff want the Trust to be much better. Individual staff and teams are at their best when they feel valued and supported, and it is clear that we still have much m ore to do before all staff feel so pos itive. Our Organisational Development Team is providing specific local reports for every Director ate and locality / service are a. These will be discuss ed with each of the teams and local action plans developed. Page 49 Staff views are important and the 2018 Staff Survey reports have been published on our intranet and publicised in the Weekly Round-up email bulletin. Throughout 2019 communications will periodically publish \"You sa id - we did\" bulletins to share with staff the actions we are taking on the survey findings. The survey results have been sent to directors to enable them to deliver staff briefings and to consider actions for specific groups and directorates. The Equality and Diversity Group will be considering equality areas. A particular area of concern and for attention is how staff with a disability have a less favourable experience of work comp ared with staff without a disability. In addition, the survey results will be considered at the Trade Union Partnership Forum, the Health and Safety Committee, the Security Advisory Group and the Trust Board. A follow-up report on the actions taken so far will go to the Board in May 2019 . 13% of our staff expressed that they had experienced harassment, bullying or abuse from other staff during the 12 months prior to comp leting the survey, a decrease from the previous year's score of 20%. The national average for similar Trusts is 16.3%. The highest score for similar Trusts is 11.8% so we are just below the b est score. The Trust 's score for staff believing we provide equal opportunities for career progression or promotion is 90.4%, which is a slight decrease on our previous score of (91%). The national average for similar trusts for this indicator is 85.8%%. The highest score for similar Trusts is 90.5% so we match the h ighest level for a Trust of our type. The staff survey re view group (whose membership is staff governors and our trade union partnership forum joint chairs) has identified two are as for specific work: 1. Imme diate Managers: The scores for immediate managers have declined for all six of the questions. Focus groups with our band 5 and band 6 managers will take place to better understand the experiences of our imme diate managers so that a further support can be developed and access to current support impro ved. This will also address supporting everyone to feel valued at work. 2. Senior management The 2018 results show that staff would like greater visibility to and involvement with and senior manager and the Board with impro ved communications between senior management and staff. A programme of activity will be developed and guided with the steering group to enhance the initiatives already underway. The programme includes the launch of podcasts and vlogs that supplement the estab lished co mmunications methods. Page 50 Mandatory Stateme nt Eight: Quality of data Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust submitted records during 2018/19 to the Secondary Uses service for inclusion in the Hospital Episode Statistics which are included in the latest published data. The percentage of records in the published data: Which included the patient's valid outpatient care; and N/A for accident and emergency care. Which included the patient's valid General Medical Practice Code was: 100% for admitted patient care; 100% for outpatient care; and N/A for accident and emergency care. (data up to March 2019) Mandatory Stateme nt Nine: Information Governance (IG) In 2018/19 Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust Information Governance toolkit was replaced by the Data Protection and Security toolkit to meas ure performan ce against the National Data Guardian' ten data security standards. The organisation scored as standard not met, with an impro vement action plan accepted by NHS Digital for 2019/20. In 2017/18 the Assessment Report overall score was 66% and was graded 'Green' from the Information Governance Toolkit Grading Scheme. Mandatory Stateme nt Ten: Payment by results Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust was not subject to the Payment by Results clinical coding audit during the reporting period by the Audit Commission. The Trust's Clinical Coding Department was audited by the external auditors D&A Clinical Coding Consultancy Limited on 18th - 20th of February 2019. According to the Data Security Standard 1 Data Quality, the Trust attained the Advisory level. Fifty episodes of care were audited for mental health and one hundred episodes of care for commu nity health. The 100 episodes for community health included patients admitted for rehabilitation as well as the specialities General Surgery, Oral Surgery, Trauma and Orthopaedics, Gynaecology, Urology, General Medicine and Gastroenterology. Within both mental and community health services there is a high standard of coding demonstrated. A more detailed bre akdown of the audit is shown in the table. Mental Health Commun ity Health Primary Diagnosis 94% 98% Secondary Diagnosis 96.5% 97% Primary Procedure N/A 100% Page 51 Secondary Procedure N/A 98% It should be noted that the results of the external audit should not be extrapolated further than the actual samp le aud ited. Mandatory Stateme nt Eleven: Payment by results Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust will be taking the following actions to impro ve data qu ality: Care is to be taken by the clinical coders that when viewing coding undertaken by another trust, we only use those codes as a point of reference and do not copy them as we may not have access to the same information Clinical coders are reminded that they are not allowed to interpr et blood results because then it looks like we are making a diagnosis Care to be taken when assigning codes for a comorbidity that is applicable within the puerperal period. For example a patient has given birth three weeks ago and has hypertension. PERFOR MANCE AGAINST THE KEY NATIONAL PRIORITIES - QUALITY INDICATORS 2018/19 The following table provides an overview of the Trust performance against a core set of indicators set by the Department of Health and Monitor. Data relates to the e nd of 2017/18 and the end of 2018/19 as published on the Health and Soc ial Care Information Centre website.

England Digital in June 2019 The Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: This data is taken directly from the RIO (electro nic patient records) and is audited daily to check accuracy. The Dorset Healthcare University NHS Foundation Trust has taken the following action to improve this percentage, and so the quality of its services, by continuing to follow up patients within seven days of discharge. The Indicator remains above required thre sholds and is actively monitored. Dor set He althcare continue to maintain this position and report any variances via the Directorate Management Groups.

Since the review of this indicator in 2013/14, clinical staff are continuously reminded of how to record in a consistent manner. The Dorset Healthcare University NHS Foundation has taken the following action to improve this percentage, and so the quality of its services, by: The Indicator remains above required threshold of 95% and has now been retired. Local monitoring continues. Prescribed Indicators National average 2017/18 DHC 2017/18 Position Compa 2018/19 DHC 2018/19 Position Com parison with other Trusts The data made available to the NHS Foundation Trust by the NHS Digital with regard to the percentage of patients aged - 0 to 15; and 16 or over, readmitted to a hospital which forms part of the trust within 28 days of being disch arged from a hospital which forms part of the trust during the reporting period. 10.34% Not available: Published by NHS Digital June 2019 MH or over - 0 Year end 5.88% Not available: Published by NHS Digital June 2019 The Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: Data extracted directly from RiO (Patient Clinical System) with rules applied following discussions with the responsible teams.

Information is available at ward level to inform decision makers connected with service improvement. Page 54 The data made available to the NHS Not available 7.9 About the same Not available 7.5 About the same Foundation Trust by NHS Digital with regard to The Trust's 'Patient experience of community mental health services' indicator score with regard to a patient 's experience of conta ct with a health or social care worker during the reporting period. The Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: Data provided by the CQC. The Trust has seen an slight decrease of 0.4 in the 'health and social care wor ker' key theme of the survey in 2018; decreasing from 7.9 in 2017/18 to 7.5 in 2018/19 on a 10 point scale. The Trust continues to perform on a par (about the same1) with other trusts which took part in the survey. The health and social care worker section score of 7.5 is made up of the following questions for 2018, a comparison against last year's score and national information is included below. Question 2018 Scores for Dorset HealthCare Lowest trust score Highe st trust score 2017 Resul ts for Dorset HealthCare Were you given enough time to discuss your needs and treatment? 7.6 6.2 8.0 7.6 Did the person or people you saw understand how your mental health needs affect other areas of your life? 7.4 5.7 7.5 7.6 The Trust results in the Health and Social Care Workers section overall remain within the 'about the same' range. However Q5 Did the person or people you saw understand how your mental health needs affect other areas of your life? Was \"Better\" than other trusts nationally despite a marginal decrease from the 2017 score. Of the 11 sections in the survey, Dorset HealthCare performed \"Better\" than other Trusts across four sections, Planning Care, Medicines, Overall views of Care and Services and Overall Experience and is an improvement on 2017 results. The CQC's statistical release report, published in November 2018, stated that nationally peoples experience of mental health services have deteriorated with a consistent decline in results since 2014. The 2018 survey found overall in other areas the results have declined significantly having remained relati vely stable between 2014-2017. This year, younger respondents aged 18 to 35 and those diagnosed with non-psychotic chaotic and challenging disorders consistently reported worse than average experiences across multiple areas. However, those on the new Care Programme Approach (CPA) and those who had been in contract with NHS m ental health services for less than a year often reported better than average experiences. There has been little or no improvement across many of the areas covered by this survey, despite this, there has been a gradual but sustained increase in positive experiences of people's aware ness of knowing who to contact out of hours when having a crisis and is another area where Dorset HealthCare performed \"Better\" than other 1 'About the same' is the wording used by the CQC. It is based on a statistic called the 'expected range' which determines the range within which the trust's score could fall without differing significantly from the average, taking into account the number of respondents for each trust and the scores for all other trusts. Page 55 Trusts. The vast majority of respondents (96%) said that they knew how to contact the person organising their care if they had concerns. Nine out of 10 respondents felt this person organised their care and services either 'very well' or 'quite well'. The Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust intends to take the following actions to improve this score, and so the quality of its services, by: The Acute Care Pathway is the largest system wide review of Mental Health Services across Dorset. This transformation project is currently underway and is redesigning how Mental Health Services are designed, commissioned and delivered. This has been developed using a co-product ion method of NHS and lived exp erience expertise and country wide consultation with people who use services. The first part of the redesign 'The Retreat' opened in late April 2018 with the second Retreat planned to open in May 2019 as part of a planned series of service redesign. The services designed as part of the ACP will specifically address feedback that services needed to be more accessible, especially in times of crisis. Prescribed Indicators National average 2017/18 DHC 2017/18 Position Compa 2018/19 DHC 2018/19 Position Com parison with other Trusts The data made available to the NHS Foundation Trust by NHS Digital with regard to the num ber and, where available, rate of patient safety inciden ts reported within the Trust during the reporting period, and the num ber and percentage of such patient safety inciden ts that resulted in severe harm or death. 1.1% from NRLS cluster data with 1% for DHC from October 1st 2017 to March 31 2018 (most up to date data available) 6,602 patient safety incidents reported (62% of all incidents). 58 patient safety incidents (0.9%) resulted in severe harm (11) or death (47) Below average for the rate of patient safety incident that resulted in severe harm or death No data available from NRLS for financial year 2018/19 6,937 patient safety incidents reported (61.4% of all incidents). 73 patient safety incidents (1%) resulted in severe harm (6) or death (67) From internal incident reporting data April 1st 2018 to 31st March 2019 No data available from NRLS for financial year 2018/19 The Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: The Trust's reporting rate (per 1,000 bed days) was the third highest (out of 53 trusts) at 91.6 with the median reporting rate being 44.71 within the mental health reporting organisations reporting to the National Reporting and Learning System (NRL S). The levels of severe harm or death continue to be below the comparison data provided by the NRLS report (October 2017 to March 2018). Page 56 The Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust has taken / intends to take the following actions to improve this percentage, and so the quality of its services. A summary of the learning from all serious incidents reviewed in the previous month is shared in a variety of forums such as the Sign Up To Safety work streams, the intranet and the director ate management monthly reports which are cascaded through teams. All mental health serious incidents are shared at the Mental Health Managers meetings. Staff and carers have continue to be offered the opportunity to share experiences and learning from incidents which are then utilised in training sessions. Pressure ulcers are the highest cause group reported however there has been a sustai ned reduction in both inpatient and community avoidable pressure ulcers. Self-harm is the second highest cause group reported with the largest percentage of incidents occurring on a female adult mental health treatm ent ward. Statistical process control charts are used to identify special caus e variations. Two patients were involved in 44% of the incidents reported. Synopsis of learning from adult and child safeguarding incidents are shared through the Integrated Safeguarding Group and incorporated into safeguarding trainin g. Learning from incidents at a local level is also shared at ward manager/team leader meetings. A weekly report of all deaths is reviewed by the Patient Safety Team, Director of Nur sing Therapies and Quality and the Medical Director to e nsure th at the investigation approach identified is appropr iate to the nature of the incident.

Patients are asked to indicate their general health on the scale with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best. The avera ge adjusted health gain is the difference between the patients' pre and post-operative scores, a negative score would denote that an individual's health has deteriorated. The EQ-5D health questionnaire asks patients to class ify their health based on self-assessed levels of problems (\"no\", \"some\", \"extreme\" in the following five areas: mobility, self- care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: The Trust undertakes a relati vely small number of operations at three of its Community Hospitals. The patients are carefully screened for surgery in a community hospital and are therefore relati vely otherwise healthy individuals whose scores for health state are generally high on the first assessment. The Trust continues to monitor all PROMS data on an ongoing basis. The Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust intends to take the following actions to improve this score, and so the quality of its services, by continuing to regularly review detailed patient level data to identify issues/trends which may impact on patients' health following surge ry and take action if issues are identified.

Page 64 ANNEX 1 FEEDBACK FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS Comments by the Council of Governors Comments by the Council of Governors on the Trust Quality Report 2018/19 1. The Council of Governors welcomes the opportunity to comme nt on the Trust Quality Report for 2018/19. 2. The Council holds the view that the quality of the services de livered must be the measure by which the Trust is judged. The Quality Report is, therefore, an important element of our overall approach to holding the Board, through the Non-Executive Director s, to account for the performance of the Trust. 3. The Council is satisfied with the progress being made by the Trust in maintaining and improving the quality of the services d elivered to our community and beyond. The commitment of the Board and our staff to de liver nothing less than services of the h ighest quality is something which cont inues to impress, and is a source of great pride to the Council. The Council considers that the Board leads by example in this area. 4. The Council has been kept fully informed of the progress made by the Trust in implement ing the action plans developed af ter the 2017 Care Quality Commission inspections. The Council has been pleased with the progress made by the Trust. 5. Public understanding of the quality of Trust services is key. The Quality Report, given the mandated content, does not lend itself to review by the p ublic at large. A shorter, publicly focused a nd more accessible docume nt should be produc ed to provide a s ummary of the progress be ing made by the Trust, the issues to be addressed, the priorities for the year and the achievements and ambitions of the organisation. 6. The Council fully supports the Trust in taking forward its commitment to participation and engagement. The Council encourages the Trust to continue to engage with pat ients and the public to deepen the understanding of what quality means to our patients. 7. The Council also comments that: The Board should be congratulated on the progress made in respect of each of the quality priorities for 2018/19 and the fact that all three h ave been ac hieved in the year; The selection of the priorities for 2019/20 is supported by Governor s; Governors are aware from Council of Governors meetings and from our staff members that the recru itment of nurses continues to be a cha llenge for the Trust. Continued emphas is must be exerted to meet the staffing ch allenge. The Council hopes to see further emphasis being given to this in the c oming year. 8. In conc lusion, the Council recognises the progress being made by the Trust, the comme ndable attitude and the effort being displayed by staff, and the results being achieved in impro ving the quality of services de livered to the community. May 2019 Page 65 Borough of Poole Response to Dorset Healthcare University Foundation Trust's Quality Account 2018/19. The Council would like to thank Dorset Healthcare University Foundation Trust for meeting with representatives of Borough of Poole's, Health and Social Care Overview and Scrutiny committee throughout the year. The Report gives a clear outline of how the Trust is endeavouring to deliver high quality care and the activities und ertaken during the financial year to improve ser vices. It is commendable the work undertaken to improve mental health servic es over the year including the opening of the Retreat in Bournemouth, the national recognition of the work to support the armed forces and the work to enhance me ntal health wards for older people. With regard to the pri ority areas for 2018/19 we comme nd the Trust in making pos itive strides in relation to: Patient Experience- Efforts in continuing to roll out the triangle of care across all mental health ser vices; it is prom ising that many teams within in-patient and community settings have undertaken carers awareness training to understand the importance of carers in the patient journey. We are also encouraged that the Trust are developing methods to listen to the voice of young people using CAMHS servic es particularly in a qualitative way; and that service impro vement continues in regards to implement ing the necessary change to meet the Dementia Friendly Hospital Charter. Patient Safety- it is good to note the implementation of the national early warning score tool and that staff are currently receiving training in its use in order to trigger early clinical intervention for the deteriorating patient. It is also positive to note the increased levels of life support training and that insulin dependent in- patients are being emp owered to co ntinue to self manage their medication as they would be at home. Clinical Effectiveness- It is unfortunate that the Trust is not on track to meet the national CQUIN target for referral to quit smoking, but it is encouraging that a partnership approach is being taken in order to address this issue. It is also good to note that the Trust has been invited to share best practice with other stakeholders moving forward. It is useful that the Trust will be continuing to report against this priority in 19/20 a nd to receive further updates on this measure. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the progress against the quality priorities, we look forward to reading the published version of the Quality Account but please take this letter as Borough of Poole's response to the Trusts' Quality Account for 2018/19. Yours sincerely Phil Hornsby Head of Commissioning and Impro vement, People Ser vices Borough of Poole Page 66 Dorset County Council Quality Account and Report 2018/19 On behalf of the Dorset Health Scrutiny Committee, please find attached the commentary that we would like to submit for the Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust Quality Account and Report 2018/19. Dorset Health Scrutiny Comm ittee comment ary for Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust, April 2019: Each year Dorset Health Scrutiny Committee appoints a Task and Finish Group of three Members who meet twice per year with representatives of the Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust to review quality and performance. These meetings provide an opportunity for informal discuss ion and challenge, giving a helpful insight into the work and aspirations of the Trust. With respect to the Quality Account and Report 2018/19, the following matters were of particular interest: The progress made by the Trust in increas ing patient and family/carer involvement, including the Triangle of Care initiative, demonstrates a high level of commitment to this priority. Dorset Health Scrutiny Committee recognises the importance of this work and looks forward to the further development of feedback opportunities for children and young people accessing CAMHS over the comi ng year; The Trust's achievements with respect to patient safety are to be congratulated, particularly the work around sepsis identification. It is hoped that the training programme associated with this will continue to de velop, including the work to involve care ho mes; Suicide prevention has been a topic of interest for Dorset Health Scrutiny Committee in 2018/19, so it was encouraging to note the successful actions that have been undertaken by the Trust over the last year, in addition to the future work, going forwards. In particular it is hoped that the Retreat and Community Front Rooms planned for rural Dorset will provide much needed support for individuals at times of distress or crisis, and the Committee looks forward to hearing more about these resources once they have been established; The Parliament ary Award given to the Dorset Armed Forces Community Health and Wellbeing Team demonstrates the excellent work that has been undertaken to support local vetera ns and their families. This accolade, along with the award given to the Criminal Justice Liaison and Diversion Service and the recognitions of achievement for a number of other teams and services, provides assurance to the Committee that the Trust strives to impro ve; The publication of an inspection report by the Care Quality Commission in April 2018 provided further reassura nce, with the Trust 's rating increasing from 'requires impro vement' to 'good' overall. The Committee hopes that the areas highlighted for impro vement will be actioned quickly and that the on- going recru itment of staff can b enefit from the positive outcome of the inspection; It was disappointing to note that, whilst compa ring favourably with similar Trusts, performance in a couple of key indicators (patient safety incidents and people experiencing a first episode of psychosis treated with a NICE-approved care package within two weeks of referral), have shown little or no impro vement up to the point at which data for 2018/19 was available. It is acknowledged that the Trust will continue to monitor these indicators and seek to impro ve performance. Overall, the Dorset Health Scrutiny Committee welcomes the progress of the Trust and the continued cooperation in providing information and actively participating at both formal and informal meetings. Yours sincerely, Ann Harris Health Par tnerships Officer Page 67 On behalf of Dorset Health Trust Quality Stateme nt 2018/2019 Healthwatch Dorset welcomes the opportunity to comment on NHS Dorset Healthcare University Hospital Foundation Trust's quality account for 2018/19. Healthwatch Dorset exists to promote the voice of patients and the wider public with respect to health and social care services. As of April 1st 2019 Healthwatch Dorset came under new management and therefore we are unable to comment on the previous year's activity as it relates to work carried out under the previous Healthwatch Dorset contract. However, we look forward to developing relationships with the Trust over the coming year and working with them to ensure the experiences of patients, their families and unpaid carers are heard and taken seriously. Dorset Clinical Commissioning Group Re: Quality Account 2018/19 Thank you for asking NHS Dorset Clinical Commissioning Gro up (CCG) to review and comme nt on your Quality Accounts for 2018/19. Please find below the CCG's statement. Dorset Clinical Commissioning Gro up welcomes the opportunity to provide th is stateme nt on Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust's Quality Account. We have reviewed the information presented within the Account and can confirm that the report is an acc urate reflection of the information we have received during the year as part of existing contract/performance monitoring discuss ions during 2018/19. The CCG recognises the areas of strength described in the Quality Account and the areas which require further progress. During the year Commissioners have cont inued to see progress in a number of areas such as quality impro vements within in-patient units, including the continued embedding of the Triangle of Care enhancing the e xperience of people who use the services in Dorset. Alongside th is is the o ngoing commitment to 'sign up to safety' campa ign, and the continued ambition to develop a more op en and hon est culture supporting staff to de liver safe, high quality care through excellence, comp assion and expertise. We also commend the Trust for its development of new ways of delivering mental health services with the new Retreat in Bournemouth which is having a positive impact for service users in Dorset. Alongside this the NHS70 Parliamentary Award, recognises the progress in the experience for vetera ns and their families within Dorset and the service impro vement being driven through partnership working. During the year progress has also been made in implementing the deteriorating patient commitment and work with Wessex Academic Sc ience Network in the d evelopment of News 2 which cont inues to progress across all sites. The CCG is supportive of the focus of the quality priorities for 2019/20 and will continue to work with the Trust over the comi ng year to ensure all quality standards are monitored as set out in the reporting requireme nts of the NHS Contract. The CCG also recognises the Trust 's support and collaborative working with all health and social care partners to improve the quality of services for all Dorset residents. As Commissioners we look forward to working with the Trust during 2019/20. Please do n ot hesitate to contact me if you require any further information. Yours sincerely Vanessa Read Page 68 Director of Nursing & Quality Changes made as a result of feedback from our stake holders Following receipt of these written statements, there are no significant changes to our Quality Account required from the feedback and therefore no changes were necessary.

Scope and subject matter The indicators for the year ended 31 March 2019 subject to limited a ssurance co nsist of the following two national priority indicators: percentage of incomplete path ways within 18 weeks for patients on incomplete pathways at the end of the reporting period; and early intervention in psychosis (EIP): people experiencing a first episode of psychosis treated with a National Institute for Health and C are Excellence (NICE)-approved care package within two weeks of referral. We refer to these national priority indicators collectively as the 'indicators '. Respective responsibilities of the direct ors and auditors The directors are responsible for the content and the preparation of the Quality Report in acc ordance with the criteria set out in the NHS Foundation Tru st Annual Reporting Manual issued by NHS Impro vement. Our responsibility is to form a conclusion, based on limited a ssurance procedures, on whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that: the Quality Report is not prepared in all material respects in line with the criteria s et out in the NHS Foundation Tru st Annual Reporting Manual and supporting guidance; the Quality Report is not consistent in all material respects with the sources specified in the Detailed re quireme nts for quality reports for foundation trusts 2018/19 ('the Guidance'); and the indicators in the Quality Report identified as having been the su bject of limited as surance in the Quality Report are not reasonably stated in all material respects in acc ordance with the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual and the six dimensions of data quality set out in the Guidance. We read the Quality Report and cons ider whether it addresses the content requirements of the NHS Found ation Trust Annual Reporting Manual and cons ider the implications for our report if we beco me aware of any material omissions. We read the other information conta ined in the Quality Report and consider whether it is materially inconsistent with; Board minutes and papers for the period April 2018 to May 2019; papers relating to quality reported to the board over the p eriod April 2018 to May 2019; feedback from commissioners, d ated May 2019; feedback from governor s, dated May 2019; feedback from local Healthwatch organisations, dated 18 April 2019; feedback from Overview and Scr utiny Committee, dated 29 March 2019 and 30 April 2019; the n ational staff survey, dated F ebruary 2019; Care Quality Commission Inspection, dated 13 April 2018; and any other information included in our review. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with those docume nts (collectively, the 'documents'). Our responsibilities do n ot extend to any other information. Page 75 We are in c ompliance with the applicable independence and competency requirements of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) Code of Ethics. Our team compris ed assurance pract itioners and relevant subject matter experts. This report, including the conclusion, has been prepared so lely for the Council of Governors of Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust as a bod y, to assist the Council of Governors in reporting the NHS Foundation Trust's quality agenda, performance a nd activities. We permit the disclosure of this report within the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2019, to ena ble the Council of Governors to demonstrate they have discharged their governance responsibilities by commissioning an independent assurance report in con nection with the indicator. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do n ot accept or assume responsibility to an yone other than the Council of Governors as a body and Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust for our work or this report, except where terms are express ly agreed and with our prior consent in writing. Assurance work performed We conducted this limited assura nce engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) - 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information', issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board ('ISAE 3000'). Our limited assurance procedures included: evaluating the design and imp lementation of the key processes and controls for managing and reporting the indicator; making enquiries of management; testing key management controls; limited te sting, on a selective bas is, of the d ata used to calculate the indicator back to supporting document ation; compari ng the content requirements of the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual to the categories reported in the Quality Report; and reading the documents. A limited ass urance engagement is smaller in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement. The nature, timing and extent of proced ures for gathering sufficient appropriate evidence are deliberately limited relative to a reasonable assurance engagement. Limitations Non-financial performance information is subject to more inherent limitations than financial information, given the characteristics of the su bject matter and the methods used for determining such information. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw allows for the selection of different, but acceptable measurement techniques which can res ult in materially different measurements and can affect comp arability. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. Furthermore, the nature and methods used to determine such information, as well as the measurement criteria a nd the precision of these criteria, may change over time. It is important to read the quality report in the co ntext of the criteria set o ut in the NHS Foundation Tru st Annual Reporting Manual and supporting guidance. The scope of our assurance work has not included governance o ver quality or the non-mandated indicator, which was deter mined locally by Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust. Basis for qualified conclusion on the p ercentage of incomplete pathways within 18 weeks for patients on incomplete pathways indicator As a result of the proce dures performed in relation to the percentage of incomplete pathways within 18 weeks for patients on incomplete pathways we have not been able to gain assurance over the accuracy Page 76 dimension of the six dimensions of data quality as required by NHS Improvement. We identified two issues from a sample of 41: One c ase where the c lock start date did not agree to the underlying rec ords; and One c ase where the c lock stop date was not recorded correctly. Qualified c onclusion Based on the results of our procedures, except for the effects of the matters described in the 'basis for qualified co nclusion on the percentage of incomplete pathways within 18 weeks for patients on incomplete pathways at the e nd of the re porting period' sect ion above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that, for the year ended 31 March 2019: the Quality Report is not prepared in all material respects in line with the criteria s et out in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual; the Quality Report is not consistent in all material respects with the sources specified in the Guidance; and the indicators in the Quality Report subject to limited ass urance ha ve not been reasonably stated in all mater ial respects in accordance with the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual and the s ix dimensions of data quality set out in the Guidance.

Accounting Policies and Other Inform ation NHS Improvement, in exercising the statutory functions conferred on Monitor, is responsible for issuing an accounts direction to NHS founda tion trusts unde r the NHS Act 2006 . NHS Improvement has directed that the accounts of NHS founda tion trusts shall meet the accounting requirements of the Department of Health Group and Social Care Accounting Manual (DHSC GAM) which shall be agreed with HM Treasury. Consequen tly, the following accounts have been prepared in accordance with the DHSC GAM 2018 /19 issued by the Department of Health and Social Care. The accounting policies contained in the DHSC GAM follow International Financial Reporting Standa rds (IFRS) to the extent that they are meaningful and appropriate to the NHS, as determined by HM Treasury, which is advised by the Financial Reporting Advisory Board. Where the GAM permits a choice of accounting policy, the accounting policy that is judge d to be most appropriate to the particular circumstances of the founda tion trust for the purpose of giving a true and fair view has been selected. The particular policies adop ted are described below. The accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the accounts. 1.1 Accounting Convention These accounts have been prepared unde r the historical cost convention modified to account for the revaluation of property and plant and certain financial assets and financial liabilities. 1.2 Going Concern These accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Directors have a reasonab le expectation that the Trust has adequa te resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeab le future. 1.3 Acquisitions and Discontinu ed Operations Activities are considered to be 'discontinued ' where they meet all of the following conditions: a. the sale or termination is completed either in the period or before the earlier of three months after the commencement of the subsequen t period and the date on which the accounts are approved; b. if a termination, the former activities have ceased permanen tly; c. the sale or termination has a material effect on the nature and focus of the reporting NHS Trust's operations and represents a material reduction in its operating facilities resulting either from its withdrawal from a particular activity or from a material reduction in income in the Trust's continuing operations; d. the assets, liabilities, results of operations and activities are clearly distinguishable, physically, operationally and for financial reporting purposes; and e. the activity moves to an organisation outside of the \"Whole of Government Accounts\" bounda ry. The Whole of Government Accounts comprises organisations within the UK public sector. Operations not satisfying all these conditions are classified as continuing. Activities are considered to be 'acquired' whether or not they are acquired from outside the public sector. 1.4 Revenue from contracts with customers Where income is derived from contracts with customers, it is accounted for unde r IFRS 15. The DHSC GAM expand s the definition of a contract to include legislation and regulations which enab les an entity to receive cash or another financial asset that is not classified as a tax by the Office of National Statistics (ONS). As directed by the DHSC GAM, the transition to IFRS 15 in 2018 /19 has been completed in accordance with paragraph C3 (b) of the Standa rd: applying the Standa rd retrospectively but recognising the cumulative effects at the date of initial application (1 April 2018 ). Dorset HealthCa re University NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Accounts 2018/19 1.4 Revenue from cont racts with customers (contin ued) Revenue in respect of goods/ services provided is recognised when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied by trans ferring promised goods/ services to the custo mers and is measured at the amount of the transact ion price allocated to those performance obligations. At the year end, the Trust accrues income relating to performance obligations satisfied in that year. Where the Trust's entitlement to consideration for those goods or services is unconditional a contract receivable will be recognised. Where entitlement to consideration is conditional on a further factor other than the passage of time, a contract asset will be recognised. Where consideration received, or receivable relates to a performance obligation that is to be satisfied in a future period, the income is deferred and recognised as a contract liability. Services are typically contracted to be provided evenly over a financial year. For the majority of income, invoices are raised dated the first of the month in which the service is being provided. These invoices are usually paid in that month so there are no contract balances outstanding at the end of each month. For other income, invoices are raised according to local agreement and can lead to contract receivables or contract liabilities being recorded, depending on when the invoices is raised relevant to the satisfaction of the performance obligations. Cred it terms are 30 days and invoiced amounts will remain showing as contract receivables until settled. Revenue from NHS cont racts The majority of the Trust's revenue is obtained for the provision, in Dorset, of Community and Mental Health services under block contracts with local clinical commissioning group (CCG). The Local Authority also commissions substantial Community services and NHS England funds specialised Mental Health services. Other operating income is material in total, but individual elements within it are not material. The actual recipients of our performance obligations are the beneficiaries of our services and not those with whom the service contracts are agreed. Services are typically contracted to be provided evenly over a financial year. A proportion (normally 2.5% of base income) of CCG and NHS England income for services to the general public is subject to Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) goals. Since the commissioners determine whether the CQUIN conditions are met after the year end, judgement is used to determine whether any related revenue should be deferred. The amount subject to uncertainty is normally not material. Page A7 Page A8 Dorset HealthCare University NHS Found ation Trust - Annual Accounts 2018 /19 1.5 Expenditure on Employee Benefits Short-term employee benefits Salaries, wages and employment related payments such as social security costs and the apprenticeship levy are recognised in the period in which the service is received from employees. The cost of annua l leave entitlement earned but not taken by employees at the end of the period is recognised in the accounts to the extent that employees are permitted to carry forward leave into the following period. Pension costs NHS Pension Scheme Past and present employees are covered by the provisions of the NHS Pension Scheme. The scheme is an unfunded , defined bene fit scheme that covers NHS employers, gene ral practices and other bodies, allowed unde r the direction of Secretary of State, in England and Wales. It is not possible for the NHS founda tion trust to identify its share of the unde rlying scheme liabilities. Therefore, the scheme is accounted for as a defined contribution scheme. Employers pension cost contributions are charged to operating expenses as and when they become due. Additional pension liabilities arising from early retirements are not funde d by the scheme except where the retirement is due to ill-health. The full amount of the liability for the additional costs is charged to the operating expenses at the time the Trust commits itself to the retirement, regardless of the method of payment. Further details are available in Note 4.6. 1.6 Expenditure on Goods and Services Expend iture on good s and services is recognised when, and to the extent that they have been received, and is measured at the fair value of those good s and services. Expend iture is recognised in operating expenses except where it results in the creation of a non-current asset such as property, plant and equipment. 1.7 Property, Plant and Equip ment Recognition Property, plant and equipment is capitalised where: it is held for use in delivering services or for administrative purposes; it is probab le that future economic bene fits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the Trust; it is expected to be used for more than one financial year; the cost of the item can be measured reliably; and - they individually have a cost of at least \u00a35,000; or - collectively, a number of items have a cost of at least \u00a35,000 and individually have a cost of more than \u00a3250 , where the assets are functionally interdependen t, had broadly simultaneou s purchase dates, are anticipated to have simultaneou s disposal dates and are unde r single manage rial control. Where a large asset, for example a building, includes a number of componen ts with significantly different asset lives e.g. plant and equipment, then these componen ts are treated as separate assets and depreciated over their own useful lives. Page A9 Dorset HealthCare University NHS Found ation Trust - Annual Accounts 2018 /19 1.7 Property, Plant and Equip ment (continu ed) Measurement Valuation All property, plant and equipment assets are measured initially at cost, representing the costs directly attributable to acquiring or constructing the asset and bringing it to the location and condition necessary for it to be capab le of operating in the manner intende d by manage ment. All assets are measured subsequen tly at market value in existing use, except for an item of property, plant and equipment which is surplus with no plan to bring it back into use which is valued at fair value unde r IFRS 13, if it does not meet the requirements of IAS 40 or IFRS 5. For assets other than land and buildings, depreciated value is considered to be equivalent to market value in existing use. Revaluations of property, plant and equipment are performed with sufficient regularity to ensure that carrying values are not materially different from those that would be determined at the end of the reporting period. Current values in existing use are determined as follows: - Land and non-specialised buildings - market value for existing use. - Specialised buildings - depreciated replacement cost on a modern equivalent asset basis. Assets held at depreciated replacement cost have been valued on an alternative site basis where this would meet the location requirements of the services being provided. Properties in the course of construction for service or administration purposes are carried at cost, less any impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees but not borrowing costs, which are recognised as expenses immediately, as allowed by IAS 23 for assets held at fair value. Assets are revalued and depreciation commences when they are brough t into use. Subsequent expenditure Subsequen t expend iture relating to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probab le that additional future economic bene fits or service potential deriving from the cost incurred to replace a componen t of such item will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be determined reliably. Where a componen t of an asset is replaced, the cost of the replacement is capitalised if it meets the criteria for recognition above. The carrying amount of the part replaced is de-recognised. Other expend iture that does not gene rate additional future economic bene fits or service potential, such as repairs and maintenan ce, is charged to the Statement of Comprehen sive Income in the period in which it is incurred. Depreciation Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated evenly over their remaining useful economic lives in a manne r consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery bene fits. Freeho ld land is considered to have an infinite life and is not depreciated. Property, plant and equipment which has been reclassified as 'Held for Sale' ceases to be depreciated upon the reclassification. Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until the asset is brough t into use. Buildings, installations and fittings are depreciated on their market value in existing use evenly over the estimated remaining life of the asset as assessed by the Trust's professional valuers. Leaseholds are depreciated over the primary lease term. Equipment is depreciated on cost evenly over the estimated life. Page A10 Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foun dation Trust - Annual Accounts 2018 /19 1.7 Propert y, Plant and Equipment (cont inued) Revaluation gains and losses and impairment Increases in asset values arising from revaluat ions are recognised in the revaluat ion reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse an impairment previously recognised in operat ing expenses, in which case they are recognised in operat ing expenses. Revaluat ion losses are charged to the revaluat ion reserve, to the extent that there is an available balance for the asset concerned, and thereaf ter are charged to operat ing expenses. Gains and losses recognised in the revaluat ion reserve are repor ted in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as an item of 'other comprehensive income'. In accordance with the DHSC GAM, impairmen ts that arise from a clear consu mption of econo mic benefi ts or service potential in the asset are charged to operat ing expenses. A compensat ing transfer is made from the revaluat ion reserve to the income and expendi ture reserve of an amount equal to the lower of (i) the impairment charged to operat ing expenses; and (ii) the balance in the revaluat ion reserve attributable to that asset before the impairmen t. An impairment that arises from a clear consu mption of econo mic benefit or service potential is reversed when, and to the extent that, the circu mstances that gave rise to the loss are reversed. Reversals are recognised in operat ing expenses to the extent that the asset is restored to the carrying amount it would have had if the impairment had never been recognised. Any remaining reversal is recognised in the revaluat ion reserve. Where, at the time of the original impairmen t, a transfer was made from the revaluat ion reserve to the income and expendi ture reserve, an amount is transferred back to the revaluat ion reserve when the impairment reversal is recognised. Other impairmen ts are treated as revaluat ion losses. Reversals of 'other impairmen ts' are treated as revaluat ion gains. De-recogn ition Assets intended for disposal are reclassified as 'Held for Sale' once all of the following criteria are met: The asset is available for immedia te sale in its present condi tion subject only to terms which are usual and customary for such sales; The sale must be highly probable i.e.: - manage ment are committed to a plan to sell the asset; - an active progra mme has begun to find a buyer and complete the sale; - the asset is being actively marketed at a reasonable price; - the sale is expected to be completed within 12 months of the date of classificat ion as 'Held for Sale'; and - the actions needed to complete the plan indicate it is unlikely that the plan will be abandoned or significant changes made to it. Follo wing reclassificat ion, the assets are measured at the lower of their existing carrying amount and their 'fair value less costs to sell'. Deprecia tion ceases to be charged and the assets are not revalued, except where the 'fair value less costs to sell' falls below the carrying amount. Assets are de-recognised when all material sale contract condi tions have been met. Proper ty, plant and equip ment which is to be scrapped or demolished does not qualify for recogni tion as 'Held for Sale', and instead, is retained as an operat ional asset and the asset's econo mic life is adjus ted. The asset is de- recognised when scrapping or demoli tion occurs. The revaluat ion surplus included in equity in respect of an item of proper ty, plant and equip ment is transferred direc tly to the income and expendi ture reserve when the asset is disposed of. Page A11 Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foun dation Trust - Annual Accounts 2018 /19 1.7 Propert y, Plant and Equipment (cont inued) Donated assets Donated proper ty, plant and equip ment assets are capitalised at their fair value on receip t. The dona tion is credi ted to income at the same time, unless the donor has imposed a condi tion that the future econo mic benefi ts embodied in the grant are to be consu med in a manner specified by the donor, in which case, the dona tion is deferred within liabili ties and is carried forward to future financial years to the extent that the condi tion has not yet been met. The dona ted assets are subsequent ly accounted for in the same manner as other items of proper ty, plant and equipmen t. 1.8 Intang ible Assets Recogn ition Intangible assets are non-monetary assets without physical subs tance which are capable of being sold separately from the rest of the Trust's business or which arise from contractual or other legal rights. They are recognised only where it is probable that future econo mic benefi ts will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the Trust and where the cost of the asset can be measured reliabl y. Interna lly generated intang ible research not capitalised. Expendi ture on develop ment is capitalised only where all of the following can be demons trated: the project is technically feasible to the point of completion and will result in an intangible asset for sale or use; the Trust intends to complete the asset and sell or use it; the Trust has the ability to sell or use the asset; how the intangible asset will generate probable future econo mic or service delivery benefi ts e.g. the presence of a market for it or its output, or where it is to be used for internal use, the usefulness of the asset; adequa te financial, technical and other resources are available to the Trust to complete the develop ment and sell or use the asset; and the Trust can measure reliably the expenses attributable to the asset during the develop ment. Software Software which is integral to the operat ion of hardware e.g. an operat ing system, is capitalised as part of the relevant item of proper ty, plant and equip ment. Software which is not integral to the operat ion of hardware e.g. applicat ion software, is capitalised as an intangible asset. Measure ment Intangible assets are recognised initially at cost, comprising all direc tly attributable costs needed to create, produce and prepare the asset to the point that it is capable of operat ing in the manner intended by manage ment. Subsequent ly, intangible assets are measured at current value in existing use. Where no active market exists, intangible assets are valued at the lower of deprecia ted replace ment cost and the value in use where the asset is income generat ing. Revaluat ion gains, losses and impairmen ts are treated in the same manner as for proper ty, plant and equip ment. An intangible asset which is surplus with no plan to bring it back into use is valued at fair value under IFRS13, if it does not meet the require ments of IAS 40 of IRFS 5. Intangible assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or 'fair value less costs to sell'. Amortisation Intangible assets are amor tised over their expected useful econo mic lives in a manner consis tent with the consu mption of econo mic or service delivery benefi ts. Page A12 Dorset HealthCare University NHS Found ation Trust - Annual Accounts 2018/19 1.9 Fixed Asset Investme nts The Trust is the Corporate Trustee to Dorset Health Care Charitable Fund. The Trust has assessed its relationship to the charitable fund and deter mined it to be a subsidiary because the Trust is exposed to, or has right to, variable returns and other benefits for itself, patients and staff from its involve ment with the charitable fund and has the ability to affect those returns and other benefits through its power over the fund. Normally such a relationship would require the accounts of the subsidiary to be consolidated by the Trust where material. The Dorset Health Care Charitable Fund is not sufficiently large to materially affect the results of the Trust and the Trust has therefore not consolidated the charity accounts. 1.10 Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value using the First In, First Out method. 1.11 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash is cash in hand and deposits with any financial institution repayable without penalty on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are invest ments that mature in 3 months or less from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value. 1.12 Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Recognition Financial assets and financial liabilities arise where the trust is party to the contractual provisions of a financial instru ment, and as a result has a legal right to receive or a legal obligation to pay cash or another financial instru ment. The DHSC GAM expands the definition of a contract to include legislation and regulations which give rise to arrange ments that in all other respects would be a financial instru ment and do not give rise to transactions classified as a tax by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This includes the purchase or sale of non-financial items (such as goods or services), which are entered into in accordance with the Trust 's normal purchase, sale or usage require ments, are recognised when, and to the extent which, perfor mance occurs i.e. when receipt or delivery of the goods or services is made. Classificati on and meas ureme nt Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value plus or minus directly attributable transaction costs except where the asset or liability is not measured at fair value through income and expenditure. Fair value is taken as the transaction price, or other wise deter mined by reference to quoted market prices or valuation techniques. Financial assets or financial liabilities in respect of assets acquired or disposed of through finance leases are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy for leases. Financial assets are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost. Financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost. Page A13 Dorset HealthCare University NHS Found ation Trust - Annual Accounts 2018 /19 1.12 Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (continu ed) Financial asse ts and financial liabilities at amorti sed cost Financial assets and financial liabilities at amortised cost are those held with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows and where cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. This includes cash equivalents, contract and other receivables, trade and other payables, rights and obligations unde r lease arrange ments and loans receivable and payable. After initial recognition, these financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment (for financial assets). The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset to the amortised cost of a financial liability. Interest revenue or expense is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or amortised cost of a financial liability and recognised in the Statement of Comprehen sive Income as a finance revenue or expense. In the case of loans held from the Department of Health and Social Care, the effective interest rate is the nominal rate of interest charged on the loan. Impairment of financial asse ts For all financial assets measured at amortised cost including lease receivables, contract receivables and contract assets or assets measured at fair value through other comprehen sive income, the Trust recognises an allowan ce for expected credit losses. The Trust adop ts the simplified approach to impairment for contract and other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, measuring expected losses as at an amount equa l to lifetime expected losses. For other financial assets, the loss allowan ce is initially measured at an amount equa l to 12-month expected credit losses (stage 1) and subsequen tly at an amount equa l to lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk assessed for the financial asset significantly increases (stage 2). The financial assets that are subject to credit losses are trade and other receivables. There are certain categories of income that are subject to higher credit risk and these have been assessed individually. They are immaterial but are provided for at the expected credit loss when the invoice is raised. This was based upon a review of actual losses sustained by the Trust over a number of years. For financial assets that have become credit impaired since initial recognition (stage 3), expected credit losses at the reporting date are measured as the difference between the asset's gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. Expected losses are charged to operating expend iture within the Statement of Comprehen sive Income and reduce the net carrying value of the financial asset in the Statement of Financial Position. De-recognition Financial assets are de-recognised when the contractual rights to receive cash flows form the assets have expired or the Trust has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of owne rship. Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. Page A14 Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foun dation Trust - Annual Accounts 2018 /19 1.13 Leases Leases are classified as finance leases when subs tantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operat ing leases. Finance leases Where subs tantially all risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset are borne by the Trust, the asset is recorded as Proper ty, Plant and Equipment and a corresponding liabili ty is recorded. The value at which both are recognised is the lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The implicit interest rate is that which produces a cons tant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability. The asset and liability are recognised at the incep tion of the lease, and are de-recognised when the liabili ty is discharged, cancelled or expired. The annual rental charge is split between the repayment of the liabili ty and a finance cost. The annual finance cost is calcula ted by applying the implicit interest rate to the outstanding liability and is charged to 'Finance expense' in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Operat ing leases Other leases are regarded as operat ing leases and the rentals are charged to operat ing expenses on a straight - line basis over the term of the lease. Operat ing lease incen tives received are added to the lease rentals and charged to operat ing expenses over the life of the lease. Contingent rentals are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Leases of land and buildings Where a lease is for land and buildings, the land component is separated from the building component and the classificat ion for each is assessed separatel y. 1.14 Provisions The Trust provides for legal or cons tructive obliga tions that are of uncer tain timing or amount for which it is probable that there will be a future outflow of cash or other resources at the Statement of Financial Position date on the basis of the best estimate of the expendi ture required to settle the obligat ion. Where the effect of the time value of money is significan t, the estimated risk-adjus ted cash flows are discounted using the discount rates published and manda ted by HM Treasur y. Provisions for pensions payable are discounted at 0.29% (2017 /18 0.1%). Clinical negligence costs NHS Resolu tion operates a risk pooling scheme under which the Trust pays an annual contribution to NHS Resolu tion, which, in return, settles all clinical negligence claims. Although NHS Resolu tion is adminis tratively responsible for all clinical negligence cases, the legal liabili ty remains with the Trust. The total value of clinical negligence provisions carried by NHS Resolu tion on behalf of the Trust is disclosed at Note 16, but is not recognised in the Trust's accounts. NHS Resolu tion also operates a third party liabili ty scheme that the Trust participates in. Liabili ty is limited to \u00a310k per employee claim and \u00a33k for public liabili ty claims under this scheme. Non-clinical risk pooling The Trust participates in the Proper ty Expenses Scheme and the Liabili ties to Third Parties Scheme. Both are risk pooling schemes under which the Trust pays an annual contribution to NHS Resolu tion and in return receives assis tance with the costs of claims arising. The annual membership contributions, and any 'excesses' payable in respect of particular claims are charged to operat ing expenses when the liabili ty arises. Page A15 Dorset HealthCare University NHS Found ation Trust - Annual Accounts 2018 /19 1.15 Conting encies Contingen t assets (that is, assets arising from past events whose existence will only be confirmed by one or more future events not wholly within the entity's control) are not recognised as assets, but are disclosed where an inflow of economic bene fits is probab le. Contingen t liabilities are not recognised, but are disclosed unless the probab ility of a transfer of economic bene fits is remote. Contingen t liabilities are defined as: Possible obligations arising from past events, whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the entity's control; or Present obligations arising from past events but for which it is not probab le that a transfer of economic bene fits will arise or for which the amount of the obligation canno t be measured with sufficient reliability. 1.16 Public Dividend Capital (PDC) and PDC Dividend Public dividend capital (PDC) is a type of public sector equity finance based on the excess of assets over liabilities at the time of the establishment of the predecessor NHS Trust. HM Treasury has determined that PDC is not a financial instrument within the meaning of IAS 32. At any time, the Secretary of State can issue new PDC to, and require repayments of PDC from, the Trust. PDC is recorded at the value received. A charge, reflecting the cost of capital utilised by the Trust, is payable as public dividend capital dividend. The charge is calculated at the rate set by HM Treasury (currently 3.5%) on the average relevant net assets of the Trust during the financial year. Relevant net assets are calculated as the value of all assets less the value of all liabilities, except for: (i) dona ted assets, (ii) average daily cash balances held with the Government Banking Service and National Loan s Fund depo sits, (iii) any PDC dividend balance receivable or payable, and (iv) any balance receivable from the Provider Sustainability Fund. In accordance with the requirements laid down by the Department of Health and Social Care (as the issuer of PDC), the dividend for the year is calculated on the actual average relevant net assets as set out in the 'pre-audit' version of the annua l accounts. The dividend thus calculated is not revised should any adjustment to net assets occur as a result of the audit of the annua l accounts. 1.17 Value Added Tax Most of the activities of the Trust are outside the scope of VAT and, in gene ral, output tax does not apply and input tax on purchases is not recoverable. Irrecoverable VAT is charged to the relevant expend iture category or included in the capitalised purchase cost of non-current assets. Where output tax is charged or input VAT is recoverable, the amounts are stated net of VAT. 1.18 Corpor ation Tax The Trust has no Corporation Tax liability at present. A consultation on revised legislation for Corporation Tax as applicable to Founda tion Trust status is awaited from HM Revenue and Customs. 1.19 Third Party Assets Assets belonging to third parties (such as money held on beha lf of patients) are not recognised in the accounts since the Trust has no bene ficial interest in them. However, they are disclosed in a separate note to the accounts in accordance with the requirements of the HM Treasury's FReM. See Note 19. Page A16 Dorset HealthCare University NHS Found ation Trust - Annual Accounts 2018 /19 1.20 Losses and Special Payments Losses and special payments are items that Parliament would not have contemplated when it agreed funds for the health service or passed legislation. By their nature they are items that ideally should not arise. They are therefore subject to special control procedures compared with the gene rality of payments. They are divided into different categories, which govern the way individual cases are hand led. Losses and Special Payments are charged to the relevant functional head ings in expend iture on an accruals basis, including losses which would have been made good through insurance cover had the Trust not been bearing their own risks (with insurance premiums then being included as normal revenue expend iture). Note 25 is compiled directly from the losses and compensations register which is prepared on an accruals basis with the exception of provisions for future losses. 1.21 Accounting Standards that have been issued but have not yet been adopt ed The DHSC GAM does not require the following Standa rds and Interpretations to be applied in 2018 /19. These standa rds have not been adop ted with the FReM, and therefore not applicable to DHSC group accounts. IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts Applies to first time adop ters of IFRS after 1 Janua ry 2016 . Therefore not applicable to DHSC group bodies. IFRS 16 Lease s Application required for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 Janua ry 2019 , but not yet adop ted by the FReM: early adop tion is not therefore permitted. The objective is to ensure that lessees and lessors provide relevant information in a manner that faithfully represents those transactions. The information gives a basis for users of accounts to assess the effect that leases have on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. DHSC have not yet indicated how this accounting standa rd will be applied to DHSC bodies. If the accounting standa rd is to be applied in full, then there will be a significant impact upon the accounts. Right of use assets will be created and depreciated. Liabilities will also be created which will be discounted and interest rates inherent to those contracts applied. There will therefore be fewer leasing expenses within the accounts and, instead, depreciation and interest charges. In addition, there could be impairment losses. The Statement of Financial Position will have the right of use assets recorded and correspond ing liabilities. It is anticipated that these amounts will be material. IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts Application required for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 Janua ry 2021 , but not yet adop ted FReM. Early adop tion is not permitted. IFRIC 23 Uncertainty o ver Income Tax Treatments Application required for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 Janua ry 2019 . 1.22 Accounting Standards issued that have been adopt ed early There are no accounting standa rds issued that have been adop ted early. Page A17 Dorset HealthCa re University NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Accounts 2018/19 1.23 Critical Judgemen ts in Applying Accounting Policies and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty In the application of the Trust's accounting policies, manage ment is required to make judge ments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and the estimates and underlying assumptions are continually reviewed. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Key sources of estimation uncertainty Only key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities with the next financial year are disclosed as follows: Contin gencies Advice from the senior executive team is taken when reporting contingencies. In addition, advice from relevant professionals external to the Trust is taken e.g. when determining whether to make a provision for a liability or whether to disclose as a contingency. However, the nature of contingencies is such that uncertainty is inherent. Valuation of land and buildings and useful economic lives thereon Professional valuations are obtained from the District Valuer. This includes an assessment of useful economic lives for each building. We rely upon this professional advice. If there are errors included, this would affect the value of property, plant and equipment, revaluation reser ve and possibly the deficit stated in the Statement of Comprehe nsive Income for the year as reported in the accounts. It is impracticable to disclose the extent of the possible effects of an assumpton or another source of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period. On the basis of existing knowledge, outcomes within the next financial year that are different from the assumption around the valuation of our land, propert y, plant and equipment could require a material adjustment ot the carrying amount of the asset recorded in note 8. For further detail see note 8. 1.24 Gifts Gifts are items that are voluntarily donated, with no preconditions and without the expectation of any return. Gifts include all transact ions economically equivalent to free and unremunerated trans fers, such as the loan of an asset for its expected useful life, and the sale or lease of assets at below market value.

Details of the benefits payable and rules of the Schemes can be found on the NHS Pensions website at www .nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pensions. Both are unfunded defined benefit schemes that cover NHS employers, GP practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of the Secret ary of State in England and Wales. They are not designed to be run in a way that would enable NHS bodies to identify their share of the underlying scheme assets and liabilities. Therefore, each scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme: the cost to the NHS body of participating in each scheme is taken as equal to the contributions payable to that scheme for the accounting period. In order that the defined benefit obligations recognised in the accounts do not differ materially from those that would be determined at the reporting date by a formal actuarial valuation, the FReM requires that \"the period between formal valuations shall be four years, with approximate assessments in intervening years\". An outline of these follows: a) Accounting valuation A valuation of scheme liability is carried out annually by the scheme actuary (currently the Government Actuary's Department) as at the end of the reporting period. This utilises an actuarial assessment for the previous accounting period in conjunction with updated membership and financial data for the current report ing period, and is accepted as providing suitably robust figures for financial reporting purposes. The valuation of the scheme liability as at 31 March 2019, is based on valuation data as 31 March 2018, updated to 31 March 2019 with summary global member and accounting data. In undertaking this actuarial assessment, the methodology prescribed in IAS 19, relevant FReM interpretat ions, and the discount rate prescribed by HM Treasury have also been used. The latest assessment of the liabilities of the scheme is contained in the report of the scheme actuary, which forms part of the annual NHS Pension Scheme Accounts. These accounts can be viewed on the NHS Pensions website and are published annually. Copies can also be obtained from The Stationery Office. b) Full actuarial (fundin g) valuation The purpose of this valuation is to assess the level of liability in respect of the benefits due under the schemes (taking into account recent demographic experience), and to recommend contribution rates payable by employees and employers. The latest actuarial valuation undertaken for the NHS Pension Scheme was completed as at 31 March 2016. The results of this valuation set the employer contribution rate payable from April 2019. The Department of Health and Social Care have recently laid Scheme Regulations confirming that the employer contribution rate will increase to 20.6% of pensionable pay from this date. The 2016 funding valuation was also expected to test the cost of the Scheme relative to the employer cost cap set following the 2012 valuation. Following a judgment from the Court of Appeal in December 2018 Government announced a pause to that part of the valuation process pending conclusion of the continuing legal process. The estimated employer contributions to the NHS Pension Scheme for 2019/20 are \u00a319,819k.

Investments The Trust has a fixed asset investment of \u00a31 in Ansbury Limited, a company limited by guarant ee and registered in England. The Trust is one of 15 members, as at 31 March 2019. There is no requirement to consolidate the financial results of this company in the Trust's accounts. Dorset HealthCare Charitable Fund is considered to be a subsidiary of the Trust. Whilst the Trust does not have any investment in the Charitable Fund, the Truste es of the Charitable Fund are all members of the Trust's board and so is deemed to have control over the Char itable Fund. It is normally a requirement to consolidate subsidiaries where significant and the Trust has taken the decision not to consolidate on the basis that the Charitable Fund is not material to the Trust's accounts. The principal place of business of the Charitable Fund and the Trust is Sentinel House, 4-6 Nuffield Road, Poole, Dorset, BH17 0RB. Funds within the Charitable Fund are to be used for the objects of the Charitable Fund. These are to benefit the staff and patients of the Trust. These funds cannot be used to settle NHS (the Trust) expenditure. Page A34 Dorset HealthCa re University NHS Foundation Trust - Annual Accounts 2018/19 12.
