Focusing on the T cell response, we conducted a longitudinal study of infection-na\u00efve and COVID-19 convalescent donors before vaccination and after their first and second vaccine doses, using a high-parameter CyTOF analysis to phenotype their SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Vaccine-elicited spike-specific T cells responded similarly to stimulation by spike epitopes from the ancestral, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variant strains, both in terms of cell numbers and phenotypes. In infection-na\u00efve individuals, the second dose boosted the quantity and altered the phenotypic properties of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, while in convalescents the second dose changed neither. Spike-specific T cells from convalescent vaccinees differed strikingly from those of infection-na\u00efve vaccinees, with phenotypic features suggesting superior long-term persistence and ability to home to the respiratory tract including the nasopharynx. These results provide reassurance that vaccine-elicited T cells respond robustly to emerging viral variants, confirm that convalescents may not need a second vaccine dose, and suggest that vaccinated convalescents may have more persistent nasopharynx-homing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells compared to their infection-na\u00efve counterparts. eLife digest Vaccination is one of the best ways to prevent severe COVID-19. Two doses of mRNA vaccine protect against serious illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. They do this, in part, by encouraging the immune system to make specialised proteins known as antibodies that recognise the virus. Most of the vaccine research so far has focussed on these antibodies, but they are only one part of the immune response. Vaccines also activate immune cells called T cells. These cells have two main roles, coordinating the immune response and killing cells infected with viruses. It is likely that they play a key role in preventing severe COVID-19. There are many kinds of T cells, each with a different role. Currently, the identity and characteristics of the T cells that protect against COVID-19 is unclear. Different types of T cells have unique proteins on their surface. Examining these proteins can reveal details about how the T cells work, which part of the virus they recognise, and which part of the body they protect. A tool called cytometry by time of flight allows researchers to measure these proteins, one cell at a time. Using this technique, Neidleman, Luo et al. investigated T cells from 11 people before vaccination and after their first and second doses. Five people had never had COVID-19 before, and six had already recovered from COVID-19. Neidleman, Luo et al. found that the T cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2 in the two groups differed. In people who had never had COVID-19 before, the second dose of vaccine improved the quality and quantity of the T cells. The same was not true for people who had already recovered from COVID-19. However, although their T cells did not improve further after a second vaccine dose, they did show signs that they might offer more protection overall. The proteins on the cells suggest that they might last longer, and that they might specifically protect the nose, throat and lungs. Neidleman, Luo et al. also found that, for both groups, T cells activated by vaccination responded in the same way to different variants of the virus. This work highlights the importance of getting both vaccine doses for people who have never had COVID-19. It also suggests that vaccination in people who have had COVID-19 may generate better T cells. Larger studies could show whether these patterns remain true across the wider population. If so, it is possible that delivering vaccines to the nose or throat could boost immunity by mimicking natural infection. This might encourage T cells to make the surface proteins that allow them to home to these areas. Introduction A year and a half since the December 2019 emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the novel betacoronavirus had already infected almost 200 million people and taken the lives of over 4 million, nearly collapsed worldwide health systems, disrupted the global economy, and perturbed society and public health on a scale not experienced within the past 100 years. Fortunately, multiple highly efficacious vaccines, including the two-dose mRNA-based ones developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which confer ~90 % protection against disease, were approved for emergency use before the end of 2020. Although the vaccines provide the most promising route for a rapid exit from the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns remain regarding the durability of the immunity elicited by these vaccines and the extent to which they will protect against the variants of SARS-CoV-2 now spreading rapidly around the world. The first variant observed to display a survival advantage was the D614G, which was more transmissible than the original strain and quickly became the dominant variant throughout the world [Korber et al., 2020](#bib20). This variant, fortunately, did not evade immunity and in fact appeared to be more sensitive than the original strain to antibody neutralization by convalescent sera [Weissman et al., 2021](#bib48). More worrisome, however, was the emergence at the end of 2020 of rapidly spreading variants in multiple parts of the world, including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.427/B.1.429 (originally identified in United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, and California, respectively) [Plante et al., 2021](#bib34), followed by additional highly transmissible variants in 2021 including the B.1.617.2 which was first detected in India [Callaway, 2021](#bib3). Some variants, including B.1.1.7, may be more virulent [Davies et al., 2021](#bib8). While antibodies against the original strain elicited by either vaccination or infection generally remain potent against B.1.1.7, their activity against B.1.351 and P.1 is compromised [Wang et al., et al., 2021](#bib21). Antibodies from vaccinees were 14-fold less effective against B.1.351 than against the ancestral strain, and a subset of individuals completely lacked neutralizing antibody activity against B.1.351 9 months or more after convalescence [Planas et al., 2021](#bib33). Reassuringly, early data suggest that relative to antibody responses, T-cell-mediated immunity appears to be less prone to evasion by the variants [Skelly et al., 2021](#bib38); [Tarke et 2021](#bib42); al., 2021](#bib44). Among 280 CD4+ and 523 CD8+ T cell epitopes from the original SARS-CoV-2, an average of 91.5 % (for CD4) and 98.1 % (for CD8) mapped to regions not mutated in the B.1.1.7, B1.351, P.1, and B.1.427/B.1.429 variants. Focusing on just the spike response, the sole SARS-CoV-2 antigen in the mRNA-based vaccines, then 89.7 % of the CD4+ epitopes % CD8+ epitopes are conserved [Tarke et al., 2021](#bib43). In line with this, the magnitude of the response of T cells from convalescent or vaccinated individuals was not markedly reduced when assessed against any of the variants [Tarke et al., 2021](#bib43). The relative resistance of T cells against SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion is important in light of the critical role these immune effectors play during COVID-19. T cell numbers display a strong, inverse association with disease severity [Chen et al., 2020](#bib6); [Woodruff et al., 2020](#bib51), and the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells predicts recovery from severe disease [Rydyznski Moderbacher et al., 2020](#bib37); [Neidleman et al., 2021](#bib30). cells can also provide long-term, self-renewing immunological memory: these cells are detected more than half a year into convalescence and can proliferate in response to homeostatic signals [Dan et al., 2021](#bib7); [Neidleman et al., 2020b](#bib29). Furthermore, the ability of individuals with inborn deficiencies in B cell responses to recover from COVID-19 without intensive care suggests that the combination of T cells and innate immune mechanisms is sufficient for recovery when antibodies are lacking [Soresina et al., 2020](#bib40). Although T cells against the ancestral strain display a response of similar magnitude and breadth to the variants [Tarke et al., 2021](#bib43), to what extent these T cells' phenotypes and effector functions differ during their response to variant detection is a different question. Small changes in the sequences of T cell epitopes, in the form of altered peptide ligands (APLs), can theoretically alter how the T cells respond to stimulation. Indeed, change of a single residue can convert a proliferative, IL4-secreting effector response into one that continues to produce IL4 in the absence of proliferation [Evavold and Allen, 1991](#bib11). Furthermore, APLs can activate Th1 cells without inducing either proliferation or cytokine production, shift Th1 responses into Th2-focused ones, and in some instances even render T cells anergic or immunoregulatory by eliciting TGF production [Sloan-Lancaster and Allen, 1996](#bib39). Another important aspect that has not been explored is to what extent vaccine- vs. infection-induced T cell responses differ phenotypically and functionally, and to what extent convalescent individuals benefit from vaccination as they already harbor some form of immunity against the virus. Studies based on the antibody and B cell response suggest that for COVID-19 convalescents, a single dose of the mRNA vaccines is helpful while the additional booster is not necessary [Stamatatos et al., 2021](#bib41); [Goel et al., 2021](#bib14); [Ebinger et al., 2021](#bib9); how this translates in the context of vaccine-elicited T cell immunity is not clear. To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted 39-parameter phenotyping by CyTOF on 33 longitudinal specimens from 11 mRNA-vaccinated individuals, six of whom had previously contracted and recovered from COVID-19. For each participant, blood specimens were obtained prior to vaccination, two weeks following the first dose, and two weeks following the second. For every specimen, we assessed in depth the phenotypes and effector functions of total CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells responding to the original SARS-CoV-2 spike, to spike from variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, and to nucleocapsid. By conducting analyses on the resulting 165 high-dimensional datasets generated, we find a reassuringly unaltered T cell response against the variants, an ability of the booster dose to alter the phenotypes of vaccine-elicited T cells, and a striking impact of prior infection on qualitative features of T cells elicited by vaccination. Results Study design To characterize the phenotypic features of mRNA vaccination-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, we procured 33 longitudinal blood samples from the COVID-19 Host Immune Response and Pathogenesis (CHIRP) cohort. Four of the participants had received the Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccine, while the remaining seven had received the Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) one. For all participants, longitudinal specimens were obtained at three timepoints: prior to vaccination, ~ 2 weeks (range 13-18 days) after the first vaccine dose, and ~2 weeks (range 6-38 days) after the second dose. Five of the participants were never infected with SARS-CoV-2, while the remaining six had completely recovered from mild (non-hospitalized) COVID-19 disease ( [Table 1](#table1)). These prior infections had all occurred in the San Francisco Bay Area between March and July of 2020, when the dominant local strain was the original ancestral strain. Each specimen was phenotyped using a 39-parameter T cell-centric CyTOF panel (see Materials and methods and [Table 2](#table2)) at baseline (to establish the overall phenotypes of total CD4+ and CD8+ T cells), and following 6 hr of stimulation with overlapping 15-mer peptides spanning the entire original (ancestral) SARS-CoV-2-spike, B.1.1.7 spike, B.1.351 spike, or the original SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (the latter as a control for a SARS-CoV-2-specific response not boosted by vaccination). Including all the baseline and stimulation conditions, a total of 165 specimens from the 11 participants were analyzed by CyTOF. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells elicited by vaccination recognize B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants We first confirmed our ability to identify SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells by stimulating PBMCs from vaccinated individuals with spike peptides. In line with our prior studies implementing a 6 hr peptide stimulation [Neidleman et al., 2021](#bib30); [Neidleman et al., 2020b](#bib29), spike-specific CD4+ cells specifically identified through intracellular cytokine staining for IFN, and a more robust response was observed among CD4+ than CD8+ T cells ( IL4 or IL17 by CD4+ T cells were observed in response to peptide stimulation ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/72619/figures#fig1s1)). In (AIM) such as Ox40, 4-1BB, and CD69 could also be identified in T cells after spike peptide stimulation, but with a higher background in the baseline (no peptide stimulation) specimens relative to the intracellular cytokine staining approach ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/72619/figures#fig1s1)). For reasons, in this study we exclusively used IFN positivity in the peptide-stimulated samples as a marker of antigen-specific T cells. [see all](/articles/72619/figures#fig1) In the infection-na\u00efve participants, the first vaccination dose primed a spike-specific CD4+ T cell response, which was further boosted with the second dose ( [Figure 1B](#fig1), top left). For each participant and time point, similar numbers of cells were stimulated by exposure to the ancestral or variant spikes. This finding suggests that vaccine-elicited spike-specific CD4+ T cells recognize ancestral and variant spike equally well, and is consistent with their recently reported ability to recognize variant strains [Tarke et al., 2021](#bib43). The response of vaccine-elicited CD8+ T cells to spike peptides was weaker, and mostly apparent only after the second dose ( [Figure 1B](#fig1), top right). As expected, vaccination did not elicit T cells able to respond to nucleocapsid peptides ( [Figure 1C](#fig1), top panels). In contrast to the infection-na\u00efve individuals where spike-specific CD4+ T cells were clearly elicited and then boosted upon the second dose, spike-specific CD4+ T cell responses in convalescent individuals did not show a consistent upward trend. Convalescent donor PID4112 had a large frequency of pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells that increased to >1% of the total CD4+ T cell frequency after the first dose and then dampened after dose 2 ( [Figure 1B](#fig1) , bottom left). PID4112 also exhibited an elevated nucleocapsid-specific CD4+ T cell response after the first vaccination dose ( [Figure 1C](#fig1), bottom left), which may have been due to bystander effects resulting from the concomitant large spike-specific response. In comparison, PID4112's spike-specific CD8+ T cell response was low after dose 1, and boosted after dose 2 ( [Figure 1B](#fig1), bottom right). In contrast to PID4112, the remaining five convalescent donors exhibited an overall weak spike-specific T cell response. In fact, when comparing these five donors to the five infection-na\u00efve donors, there was a significant decrease in the magnitude of the spike-specific CD4+ T cell response, while the spike-specific CD8+ T cell response was equivalent between the two groups ( [Figure 1D](#fig1)). These results were unexpected and suggest that, when excluding outlier PID4112, the magnitude of the vaccine-elicited spike-specific CD4+ T cell response (after full vaccination) was lower in convalescent individuals than in infection-na\u00efve individuals. These assessments of the magnitude of the spike-specific T cell response together suggest that (1) in infection-na\u00efve individuals the CD4+ T cell response is boosted by the second vaccination dose, (2) convalescent individuals exhibit a more disparate response, with most donors mounting a weaker response than infection-na\u00efve individuals, and (3) the response is more robust among CD4+ than CD8+ T cells. As a higher number of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells were available for analysis, we focused on this subset for our subsequent analyses. Vaccine-elicited spike-specific CD4+ T cells responding to B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 spike are indistinguishable from those responding to ancestral spike Leveraging our ability to not only assess the magnitude but also the detailed (39-parameter) phenotypic features of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells, we first determined whether the ancestral and variant spike epitopes stimulated different subsets of vaccine-elicited spike-specific CD4+ T cells. Such differences could theoretically result from the fact that ~5-10% of the spike epitopes differ between variants and ancestral strains [Tarke et al., 2021](#bib43), and may therefore act as APLs steering responding cells towards different fates. We isolated the datasets corresponding to both post-vaccination timepoints for all eleven donors, and then exported the data corresponding to spike-specific CD4+ T cells (as defined by IFN production, [Figure 1](#fig1) ). After reducing the multidimensional single-cell data for each individual specimen to a two-dimensional datapoint through multidimensional scaling (MDS) [Ritchie et al., 2015](#bib36), we observed the ancestral spike-stimulated samples to be interspersed among the B.1.1.7- and B.1.351-responding ( [Figure 2A](#fig2)). We T cells at the single-cell level. When visualized alongside total (baseline) CD4+ T cells, spike-specific cells occupied a distinct 'island' defined by high expression of IFN ( [Figure 2B](#fig2)), suggesting unique phenotypic features of these cells. To better analyze these spike-responding CD4+ T cells, we visualized them in isolation within a new tSNE which clearly demonstrated complete mixing of the cells stimulated by the ancestral, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 spike proteins ( [Figure 2C](#fig2)). Almost all the responding cells expressed high levels of CD45RO and low levels of CD45RA ( [Figure 2D](#fig2)), suggesting them to be mostly memory cells. These memory CD4+ T cells included central memory T cells (Tcm), T follicular helper cells (Tfh), and those expressing multiple activation markers (CD38, HLADR, CD69, CD25) and receptors known to direct cells to tissues including the respiratory tract (CXCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CD49d) ( [Figure 2E](#fig2)). and all other antigens quantitated by CyTOF were not statistically different between CD4+ T cells responding to the three spike proteins ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/72619/figures#fig2s1)). To confirm the identical phenotypes of the three groups of spike-responding cells, we implemented unbiased clustering by FlowSOM. Spike-stimulated cells were clustered into eight subsets, and no subset was preferentially enriched in any one of the three groups ( [Figure 2F](#fig2)). Together, these data suggest that vaccine-elicited spike-specific CD4+ T cells respond in the same manner to spike epitopes from the ancestral or variant strains, and would probably mount similar responses in vivo to infection by all three virus types. [see all](/articles/72619/figures#fig2) Phenotypic alterations of spike-specific CD4+ T cells in infection-na\u00efve recipients after the second vaccine dose We next took advantage of our longitudinal study design to assess for any changes in the differentiation of spike-specific T cell responses over the course of the 2-dose vaccination. As the data presented above suggested no phenotypic differences between CD4+ T cells responding to the ancestral, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 spike proteins, our subsequent analyses combined these datasets. We first assessed whether, among infection-na\u00efve individuals, the phenotypes of spike-specific CD4+ T cells were different after the first and second doses. While MDS and tSNE visualizations of the data revealed that the cells from the two timepoints were somewhat interspersed ( [Figure 3A-B](#fig3)), FlowSOM differences in cluster distribution ( [Figure 3C-D](#fig3)). Direct comparison of the cluster frequencies revealed a cluster (B8) significantly enriched after the first dose, and a different cluster (B5) significantly enriched after the second dose ( [Figure 3E](#fig3)). As these two clusters CD27 and CCR7 ( we cells were differentially represented among spike-specific CD4+ T cells after each of the vaccination doses. Indeed, Tcm cells were significantly higher after the first dose ( [Figure 3G](#fig3)), consistent with Cluster 8 (enriched after the first dose) expressing high levels of these two receptors. Assessment of other canonical CD4+ T cell subsets - in particular na\u00efve cell memory (Tscm), effector memory RA (Temra), effector memory (Tem), T transitional memory (Ttm), Tfh, and regulatory T cells (Treg) - revealed Tn cells, like the Tcm subset, to be decreased after the second dose. By contrast, Ttm cells were found to be higher after the second dose, while the remaining subsets were not altered ( [Figure 3G-H](#fig3)). Overall, Tcm and were the the spike-specific CD4+ T cells ( [Figure 3G-H](#fig3)). These data together suggest that after receiving the second dose, infection-na\u00efve individuals' spike-specific CD4+ T cells increase in quantity ( [Figure 1B](#fig1)), and alter their phenotypes as reflected by a decrease Tcm cells and an increase in Ttm cells. We then conducted a similar analysis in the convalescent individuals. As the pre-vaccination timepoint included spike-specific CD4+ T cells primed by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, we included all three timepoints in this analysis. When the data were visualized by MDS, it was apparent that most of the pre-vaccination specimens localized away from the post-vaccination specimens, which were interspersed with each other ( [Figure 4A](#fig4)). Similar distinctions between pre-and post-vaccination specimens were visualized at the single-cell level by tSNE, which was the cells by FlowSOM revealed that the cluster distribution was markedly skewed among the pre-vaccination cells ( [Figure 4D and E](#fig4)), under-represented ( [Figure 4F](#fig4)). Cluster C3 was the only cluster that was significantly different after 1 vs 2 doses ( [Figure 4F](#fig4)) but as this cluster comprised only <5 % of the cells it was not analyzed further. To assess what may drive the differences between the phenotypes of the pre- vs. post-vaccination spike-specific CD4+ T cells, we assessed for markers differentially expressed between clusters C2 and C5. Cluster C2 cells expressed and the co-stimulatory receptors ICOS and Ox40, while among these only [Figure 4G-I](#fig4)). None of the canonical subsets were differentially abundant after the first vs. second vaccination dose. Together, these results suggest that, in contrast to the infection-na\u00efve individuals, convalescents' spike-specific CD4+ T cells were similar after the first vs. second vaccination dose; however, in these individuals vaccination drastically altered the phenotypes of the pre-existing spike-specific CD4+ T cells (presumably elicited from the original infection). [see all](/articles/72619/figures#fig4) Vaccination-induced spike-specific CD4+ T cells from convalescent individuals exhibit unique phenotypic features of increased longevity and tissue homing We next determined whether there were any phenotypic differences between the vaccine-induced spike-specific CD4+ T cells from the infection-na\u00efve vs. convalescent individuals. Removal of convalescent outlier PID4112 revealed the magnitude of the spike-specific CD4+ T cell response to be lower in the convalescents than in infection-na\u00efve participants after full vaccination ( [Figure 1D](#fig1)). But when all donors were included there was no statistically significant difference in response magnitude ( [Figure 5A](#fig5)). However, the spike-specific CD4+ T cells from the convalescent and infection-na\u00efve individuals exhibited clear phenotypic differences when was more apparent after the second vaccine dose, but could already be observed after the first. Since the cells after the second dose are more clinically relevant (as they are the ones persisting in vaccinated individuals moving forward), we focused our subsequent analysis on just this timepoint. When visualized as a dot plot, it was apparent that the spike-specific CD4+ T cells from infection-na\u00efve individuals segregated away from those from the convalescents ( [Figure 5D](#fig5)). Clustering of the data also demonstrated differences between the two patient groups ( [Figure 5E and F](#fig5)), which was confirmed by demonstration of a significant difference in Cluster A1 abundance ( [Figure 5G](#fig5)). [see all](/articles/72619/figures#fig5) To identify these phenotypic differences, we first assessed the relative distributions of the main canonical CD4+ T cell subsets. Interestingly, the vaccinated convalescents harbored infection-na\u00efve and convalescent vaccinees ( [Figure 6B](#fig6)). To broaden our analysis, we assessed for unique features of Cluster A1, which was over-represented in the infection-na\u00efve donors, and Cluster A3, an abundant cluster which was over-represented in the convalescent donors albeit insignificantly ( [Figure 5G](#fig5)). Interestingly, Cluster A1 expressed low levels of CD127, CXCR4, and CCR7 in contrast to Cluster A3 ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A](/articles/72619/figures#fig5s1)). As Cluster A1 is enriched among the infection-na\u00efve individuals, these findings suggest that these three receptors may be expressed at lower levels on the cells from these individuals, relative to those from vaccinated convalescents. This was confirmed by our detection of higher expression of CD127, CXCR4, and CCR7 on spike-specific CD4+ T cells from the convalescents, although for CXCR4 the difference did not reach statistical significance ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B](/articles/72619/figures#fig5s1)). [see all](/articles/72619/figures#fig6) We then followed up on each of these three differentially expressed markers. CD127, the alpha chain of the IL7 receptor, can drive IL7-mediated homeostatic proliferation of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells [Neidleman et al., 2020b](#bib29), and serves as a marker of long-lived precursor memory cells [Kaech et al., 2003](#bib18). To assess the potential longevity of the spike-specific CD4+ T cells, we determined the percentage of CD127+ cells expressing low levels of the terminal differentiation marker CD57. After the second dose of vaccination, convalescent individuals harbored more long-lived (CD127+ the convalescents' spike-specific CD4+ T cells, was recently suggested to direct bystander T cells to the lung during COVID-19, and to be co-expressed with the T resident memory / activation marker CD69 [Neidleman et al., 2021](#bib30). Interestingly, spike-specific CD4+ T cells from convalescent donors harbored a highly significantly elevated proportion of CXCR4+ CD69+ cells ( [Figure 6D](#fig6)), suggesting a potentially superior ability to migrate into pulmonary tissues. The last differentially expressed antigen, CCR7, is a chemokine receptor that directs immune cells to lymph nodes. As CD62L, a selectin that also mediates lymph node homing, was also on our panel, we assessed whether CCR7+ CD62L+ cells were enriched among the spike-specific CD4+ T cells from the convalescent donors, and found this to be the case ( [Figure 6E](#fig6)). Our finding that CD62L + suggested that they may preferentially migrate out of the blood into lymphoid tissues. Supporting this possibility was our observation that, after the second vaccine dose, the percentages of CCR7+ CD62L + spike-specific cells increased as the percentages of spike-specific CD4+ T cells decreased ( [Figure 6F](#fig6)). This suggests that the low spike-specific CD4+ T cell response after the second dose of vaccination in some convalescent donors ( [Figure 1D](#fig1)) may have resulted from these cells preferentially leaving the blood compartment. This was further supported by our finding that the expression levels of CCR7 and CD62L on spike-specific CD4+ T cells inversely correlated with the magnitude of the spike-specific CD4+ T cell response ( [Figure 6G](#fig6)). CCR7+ CD62L + and CXCR4+ CD69+ CD4+ T cells have the potential to migrate into the nasopharynx, the most common site of SARS-CoV-2 entry, we obtained paired blood and nasal swabs from one of the participants (PID4101) and phenotyped total CD4+ T cells isolated from these specimens. There was a marked enrichment of both CCR7+ CD62L + and CXCR4+ CD69+ specimens ( [Figure 6H](#fig6)), suggesting that CD4+ T cells expressing these markers preferentially exit the blood and enter the nasopharynx. Together, these data suggest that after vaccination, spike-specific CD4+ T cells from convalescent individuals differ from those in infection-na\u00efve individuals in that they appear to be more long-lived, and may more readily migrate out of the blood to mucosal sites, thus explaining their overall lower frequencies measured from the blood. Phenotypic features of spike-specific CD8+ T cells from vaccinated, convalescent individuals are unique but differ from their CD4+ T cell counterparts Finally, we assessed to what extent the main similarities and differences observed with spike-specific CD4+ T cells were also seen for spike-specific CD8+ T cells. Similar to the CD4+ T cells, spike-specific CD8+ T cells stimulated by the three different spike proteins (ancestral, B.1.1.7, B.1.351) did not differ in their phenotypic features ( [Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A-C](/articles/72619/figures#fig6s1)). Also similar to the CD4+ T cells, spike-specific CD8+ T cells elicited by vaccination differed phenotypically in infection-na\u00efve vs. convalescent individuals ( [Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D-F](/articles/72619/figures#fig6s1)). Unlike the CD4+ T cell data, however, these phenotypic differences could not be accounted for by distribution changes among the main canonical Also unlike the CD4+ T cells, these differences were also not explained by differential abundance of the CD127+ 1H](/articles/72619/figures#fig6s1)). Instead, the differences appear to be due to other phenotypic changes, including elevated frequencies of activated cells in the convalescent donors, in particular those co-expressing the Tcm marker CD27 and activation marker CD38, and the checkpoint molecule and activation marker 4-1BB ( results CD8+ T cells, like their CD4+ counterparts, respond equivalently to the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants, and exhibit qualitative differences in convalescent individuals but via different phenotypic alterations than their CD4+ counterparts. Discussion T cells are important orchestrators and effectors during antiviral immunity. They may hold the key to long-term memory due to their ability to persist for decades, yet these cells have been disproportionately understudied relative to their humoral immune counterparts in the context of COVID-19. Here, we designed a longitudinal study assessing both the frequency and phenotypic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in order to address the following questions: (1) Do SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells elicited by vaccination respond similarly to ancestral and variant strains?; (2) To what extent is the second dose needed for boosting T cell responses in infection-na\u00efve and convalescent individuals?; and (3) Do vaccine-elicited memory T cells differ in infection-na\u00efve vs. convalescent individuals? To answer the first question, we compared post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cell responses against ancestral vs. the variant B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains. Consistent with recent studies [Skelly et al., 2021](#bib38); [Tarke et al., 2021](#bib42); [Tauzin et al., 2021](#bib44), we find that vaccination-elicited T cells specific to the ancestral spike protein also recognize variant spike proteins. We further demonstrate that the phenotypic features of these cells are identical, whether they are stimulated by ancestral or variant spike proteins. This was important to establish because of prior reports that effector T cells can respond differently to APLs by altering their cytokine production or by mounting an immunoregulatory response [Evavold and Allen, 1991](#bib11); [Sloan-Lancaster and Allen, 1996](#bib39). APLs could theoretically arise when a variant infects an individual that was previously exposed to ancestral spike through vaccination or prior infection. That both the quantity and quality of T cell responses is maintained against the variants may provide an explanation for the real-world efficacy of the vaccines against variants. Although limited data are available, thus far all vaccines deployed in areas where the B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 strains dominate have protected vaccinees from severe and fatal COVID-19 [Gupta, 2021](#bib15). Given the potentially important role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in protecting against severe and fatal COVID-19 [Neidleman et al., 2021](#bib30); [Dan et al., 2021](#bib7), we postulate that this protection may have been in large part mediated by vaccine-elicited T cells. In contrast, efficacy of the vaccines against mild or moderate disease in variant-dominated regions of the world is more variable. For example, in South Africa where B.1.351 is dominant, the AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 vaccine only prevented ~10 % of mild-to-moderate disease cases [Madhi et al., 2021](#bib25), while more recent data from Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine administered in Qatar, where both B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 are dominant, revealed that fully vaccinated individuals were 75 % less likely to develop COVID-19 [Abu-Raddad et al., 2021](#bib1). The overall diminished vaccine-mediated protection against milder disease in variant-dominated regions of the world might be explained by the likely important role of antibodies to prevent initial infection by blocking viral entry into host cells (manifesting as protection against asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infection), and the observation that vaccine-elicited antibodies are generally less effective against the variant than against ancestral spike in lab assays [Wang et al., et al., 2021](#bib10); [Kuzmina et al., 2021](#bib21). Reassuringly, there is no evidence that vaccinated individuals mount a weaker immune response to variants than do unvaccinated individuals, which could theoretically result through a phenomenon termed original antigenic sin (where the recall response is inappropriately diverted to the vaccination antigen at the expense of a protective response against the infecting variant strain) [Klenerman and Zinkernagel, 1998](#bib19). To address the second question of whether a booster dose is needed, we compared the T cells after the first vs. second vaccination doses, among the infection-na\u00efve and convalescent individuals. In infection-na\u00efve individuals, spike-specific responses were observed after the first vaccination dose, and were further boosted after the second. This enhancement of the T cell response after the second dose is similar to the reported increase in anti-spike IgG levels after a second dose in infection-na\u00efve individuals [Goel et al., 2021](#bib14); [Ebinger et al., 2021](#bib9). Interestingly, phenotypic changes were also observed after the second dose in that the B cells producing the anti-spike antibodies differentiated from IgM-dominant to IgG-dominant producers [Goel et al., 2021](#bib14). We also observed some phenotypic changes among spike-specific CD4+ T cells after the second dose, as reflected by an increase in the Ttm response at the expense of the Tcm response. Importantly, however, after either dose, spike-specific CD4+ T cells were still primarily Tcm and Tfh cells, the latter of which are important for providing helper function for B cells. The prominence of SARS-CoV-2-specific Tfh cells after just one dose of vaccination is consistent with prior reports that a single dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA in mice is sufficient to elicit potent B and Tfh cell responses in germinal centers [Lederer et al., 2020](#bib22). These results suggest that with regard to T cells, the booster dose is necessary for enhancing the magnitude and results in some phenotypic changes although a robust Tfh response is already established the first dose. Overall, our conclusions are in line with those drawn from serological studies [Goel et al., 2021](#bib14); [Ebinger et al., 2021](#bib9): that it is important to administer the second vaccine dose in infection-na\u00efve individuals to boost spike-specific responses. A different situation appears to be the case for convalescent individuals. Longitudinal serological studies suggest that the spike-specific antibody response in convalescent individuals after the first mRNA dose is already equivalent to that of infection-na\u00efve individuals after their second mRNA dose [Goel et al., 2021](#bib14); [Ebinger et al., 2021](#bib9), suggesting that convalescent individuals may only need a single dose of vaccination. We found no evidence of increased numbers of spike-specific CD4+ T cells after the second dose, and minimal phenotypic changes between the cells at the two post-vaccination timepoints. Spike-specific CD4+ T cells from these individuals did however exhibit marked phenotypic changes as they transitioned from the pre- to the post-vaccination timepoints. This was expected since the cells from the pre-vaccination timepoint are resting memory CD4+ T cells that were primed months prior, while the post-vaccination timepoints were more recently-reactivated memory cells. Interestingly, unlike for the infection-na\u00efve individuals where all individuals responded similarly to each dose of vaccination, the magnitude of the CD4+ T cell response differed markedly between different convalescent individuals. PID4112 had a large pool of spike-specific CD4+ T cells prior to vaccination, and their numbers increased to extremely high levels after the first vaccination dose. Surprisingly, this large peak in the spike-specific response was accompanied by an increase in the nucleocapsid-specific CD4+ T cells, which was unexpected since the vaccine does not contain nucleocapsid. We suspect this high response to nucleocapsid was due to inflammation-mediated bystander activation of T cells in an antigen-independent manner. Consistent with this hypothesis, the participant reported severe side effects (severe headache, chills, myalgia, nausea, and diarrhea) after the first dose. The remaining five convalescent donors, by contrast, never exhibited a robust T cell response, and in fact after full vaccination actually exhibited a highly significantly lower CD4+ T cell response than the infection-na\u00efve vaccinees. We speculate on an explanation further below. Overall, our results suggest that a second SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 may provide less benefit than in individuals who have not previously been exposed to SARS-CoV-2; these findings are in line with recommendations from previously published serological studies [Stamatatos et al., 2021](#bib41); [Goel et al., 2021](#bib14); [Ebinger et al., 2021](#bib9). One of the most striking observations from this study, and the third and final question we set out to answer, was the remarkably distinct phenotypes of spike-specific CD4+ T cells from infection-na\u00efve vs. convalescent individuals who were fully vaccinated. The spike-specific CD4+ T cells from the convalescent individuals harbored features suggesting increased potential for long-term persistence: they were enriched for Tcm cells, which are have longer in vivo half-lives than their Tem and Ttm counterparts [Bacchus-Souffan et al., 2021](#bib2), and express elevated levels of CD127, a marker of long-lived memory T cells [Kaech et al., 2003](#bib18). Interestingly, CD127 expression on SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells has been implicated in COVID-19 disease amelioration and in these cells' long-term persistence. CD127 expression was more frequent on spike-specific CD4+ T cells from ICU patients who eventually survived severe COVID-19 than in those that did not [Neidleman et al., 2021](#bib30). IL7, the ligand for CD127, can drive homeostatic proliferation and expansion of spike-specific CD4+ T cells [Neidleman et al., 2020b](#bib29), and CD127 is not only expressed on SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but its levels increase further over the course of convalescence [Neidleman et al., 2020b](#bib29); [Ma et al., 2021](#bib24). Together, these findings suggest that after vaccination, spike-specific CD4+ T cells in convalescent individuals may persist longer than those from infection-na\u00efve individuals, but additional long-term follow-up studies will be required to directly test whether this indeed is the case. Another interesting characteristic of post-vaccination spike-specific CD4+ T cells from convalescent individuals relative to infection-na\u00efve individuals was their expression of multiple tissue-homing receptors. In particular, these cells were preferentially CCR7+ and CXCR4+ CD69+. to lymph nodes, while CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor important in migration of hematopoietic stem cells to bone marrow, but also able to direct immune cells to the lung during inflammation [Mamazhakypov et al., 2021](#bib26). Interestingly, we recently observed co-expression of CXCR4 with CD69 (an activation marker that also identifies T resident memory cells) in pulmonary T cells from COVID-19 patients [Neidleman et al., 2021](#bib30). Many of these cells were bystander (non-SARS-CoV-2-specific) CXCR4+ CD69+ T cells whose numbers in blood increased prior to death from COVID-19. We therefore proposed a model whereby recruitment of non-SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells into the lungs of severe patients may exacerbate the cytokine storm and thereby contribute to death [Neidleman et al., 2021](#bib30). In the case of the vaccinated convalescent individuals, however, expression of CXCR4 and CD69 on SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells is expected to be beneficial as it would direct the T cells capable of recognizing infected cells into the lung. CCR7 and CD62L co-expression would further enable these cells to enter draining lymph nodes and participate in germinal center reactions. Supporting the hypothesis that the post-vaccination spike-specific CD4+ T cells from convalescent individuals may better home to lymphoid tissues is our observation that frequencies of these cells in blood correlated negatively with the extent to which they co-expressed CCR7 and CD62L. This was further supported by our finding that CD4+ T cells from the nasopharynx of the upper respiratory tract were preferentially CCR7+ CD62L + and CXCR4+ CD69+ relative to their blood counterparts. All together, these results imply that compared to infection-na\u00efve individuals, convalescents' spike-specific CD4+ T cells may be superior in surviving and migrating to the respiratory tract. Directly testing this hypothesis will require obtaining large numbers of respiratory tract cells from vaccinated, infection-na\u00efve vs. convalescent individuals (e.g. via bronchoalveolar lavages or endotracheal aspirates), or from animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, for quantitation and characterization of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Of note, vaccination of infection-na\u00efve individuals might not induce a strong humoral immunity in the respiratory mucosa either, as neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are rarely detected in nasal swabs from vaccinees [Planas et al., 2021](#bib33). If it turns out that current vaccination strategies do not ensure robust humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in the respiratory tract, then strategies that better elicit mucosal-homing SARS-CoV-2-specific B and T cells in infection-na\u00efve individuals - for example by implementing an intranasal route of mRNA immunization - may hold a greater chance of achieving sterilizing immunity. Limitations As this study was aimed at using in-depth phenotyping as a discovery tool, it focused on deeply interrogating many different conditions (e.g. spike variants, longitudinal sampling) rather than many donors. Therefore, although a total of 165 CyTOF specimens were run, only 11 donors were analyzed. The main findings reported here should be confirmed in larger cohorts using more cost-effective and high-throughput alternatives to CyTOF such as conventional flow cytometry. Such follow-up studies should also examine the functional outcomes of the discoveries made here (e.g. effect of chemokine receptor expression on homing of infection- and vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells), including in animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A second limitation of the study was the need to stimulate the specimens in order to identify and characterize the vaccine-elicited T cells, and our limiting our analyses of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells to those inducing IFN, which may have restricted our ability to characterize subsets such as Tfh cells that are relatively poor producers of this cytokine. We note however that we limited peptide exposure to 6 hours to minimize phenotypic changes caused by the stimulation, similar to our prior studies [Neidleman et al., 2021](#bib30); [Neidleman et al., 2020b](#bib29). Our analysis focused on CD4+ T cells because the overall numbers of detectable spike-specific CD8+ T cells were low. Nonetheless, the main findings we made with the CD4+ T cells - that they recognize variants equivalently, and that the phenotypes of the responding cells differ by prior SARS-CoV-2 natural infection status - were recapitulated among CD8+ T cells. Future studies should assess the phenotypes of non-stimulated, vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells using peptide-MHC tetramers/multimers. Such studies, however, would be limited to analyzing responses against a small number of epitopes, although use of combinatorial tetramers in conjunction with high-parameter phenotyping [Newell et al., 2013](#bib31) would increase the ability to characterize a larger breadth of the vaccine-elicited T cell response. Such studies however would be limited for the most part to CD8+ T cells as tetramer reagents for CD4+ T cells are less robust. A final limitation is that serological analyses were not performed in this study. As coordination between the humoral and cellular arms of immunity are likely key to effectively controlling viral replication, future studies should assess to what extent the breadth, isotypes, and functional features of spike-specific antibodies elicited by vaccination associate with the herein described phenotypic features of vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Materials and methods Human subjects [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap72619?item=s4-1) Eleven participants from the COVID-19 Host Immune Pathogenesis (CHIRP) cohort were recruited for this study. Six were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 as established by RT-PCR, and had fully recovered from a mild course of disease. Importantly, infections of these six individuals had all occurred in the San Francisco Bay Area between March and July of 2020, when the dominant local strain was the original ancestral (Wuhan) strain. The remaining five participants were not previously infected with the virus. All eleven participants were vaccinated with both doses of either of the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccines ( [Table 1](#table1)). Blood was drawn from each of the eleven participants prior to vaccination, ~ 2 weeks after the first vaccine dose, and ~2 weeks after the second vaccine dose (33 specimens total). On the day of each blood draw, PBMCs were isolated from blood using Lymphoprep (StemCell Technologies), and then cryopreserved in 90 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10 % DMSO. For participant PID4101, an additional blood-draw and intranasal swab specimens were obtained for immunophenotyping studies. This study was approved by the University of California, San Francisco, and all participants provided informed consent (IRB # 20-30588). Preparation of specimens for CyTOF [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap72619?item=s4-2) Cryopreserved PBMCs were revived and cultured overnight to allow for antigen recovery. The cells were then counted, and then 2 million cells per treatment condition were stimulated with the co-stimulatory agents 0.5 from BD Biosciences), in the presence of 0.5 M of overlapping 15-mer SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides PepMix SARS-CoV-2 peptides from or B.1.351, or overlapping 15-mer SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid peptides (all from JPT Peptide Technologies). Stimulations were conducted for 6 hours in RP10 media (RPMI 1640 medium (Corning) supplemented with 10 % FBS (VWR), 1 % penicillin (Gibco), and 1 % streptomycin (Gibco)), in the presence of 3 g/ml Brefeldin A Solution (eBioscience) to enable detection of intracellular cytokines. To establish the phenotypes of total T cells in the absence of stimulation, 2 million cells were cultured in parallel with the stimulated samples, but in the presence of only 3 g/ml Brefeldin A. After culture, the cells were treated with cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich) as a live/dead marker and fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA) as previously described [Neidleman et al., 2020b](#bib29); [Ma et al., 2020](#bib23). Cisplatin treatment and fixation was performed as follows: first, cells were resuspended in 2 ml PBS (Rockland) with 2 ml EDTA (Corning), followed by addition of 2 ml PBS/EDTA supplemented with 25 M cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 60 s. Cisplatin staining was then quenched 10 ml of CyFACS (metal contaminant-free PBS (Rockland) supplemented with 0.1 % 0.1 % sodium azide (Sigma-Aldrich)), centrifuged, and resuspended in 2 % PFA in CyFACS. Fixation was allowed to proceed for 10 minutes at room temperature, after which cells were washed twice with CyFACS, and then resuspended in CyFACS containing 10 % DMSO. Fixed cells were stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis by CyTOF. For paired blood/swab specimens from PID4101, cells were immediately cisplatin-treated and fixed, without prior cryopreservation. CyTOF staining and data acquisition [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap72619?item=s4-3) CyTOF staining was conducted in a fashion similar to recently described methods [Neidleman et al., 2021](#bib30); [Neidleman et al., 2020a](#bib28); [Xie et al., 2021](#bib52). Cisplatin-treated cells were thawed, counted, and each treatment condition was barcoded using the Cell-ID 20-Plex Pd Barcoding Kit (Fluidigm). After the cells were barcoded and washed, the barcoded samples were combined and diluted to 6 \u00d7 106 cells / 800 l CyFACS per well in Nunc 96 DeepWell polystyrene plates (Thermo Fisher). Cells were blocked with mouse (Thermo Fisher), rat (Thermo Fisher), and human AB (Sigma-Aldrich) sera for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C, and then washed twice in CyFACS. Surface CyTOF antibody staining ( [Table 2](#table2)) was conducted for 45 min at 4 \u00b0C, in a volume of 100 l / sample. Cells were then washed three times with CyFACS and fixed overnight at 4 \u00b0C in 100 l of 2 % PFA in PBS. The next day, samples were washed twice with Intracellular Fixation & Permeabilization Buffer (eBioscience), and incubated for 45 minutes at 4 \u00b0C. After two additional washes with Permeabilization Buffer (eBioscience), samples were blocked for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C in 100 l of Permeabilization Buffer containing mouse and rat sera. After one additional wash with Permeabilization Buffer, samples were stained with the intracellular CyTOF antibodies ( [Table 2](#table2)) at 4 \u00b0C for 45 min in a volume of 100 l / sample. Cells were then washed once with CyFACS, and stained for 20 min at room temperature with 250 nM of Cell-ID Intercalator-IR (Fluidigm). Immediately prior to sample acquisition, cells were washed twice with CyFACS buffer, once with MaxPar cell staining buffer (Fluidigm), and once with Cell acquisition solution (CAS, Fluidigm). Cells were resuspended in EQ Four Element Calibration Beads (Fluidigm) diluted in CAS immediately prior to acquisition on a Helios-upgraded CyTOF2 instrument (Fluidigm) at the UCSF Parnassus flow core CyTOF data analysis [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap72619?item=s4-4) CyTOF datasets, exported as flow cytometry standard (FCS) files, were de-barcoded and normalized according to manufacturer's instructions (Fluidigm). FlowJo software (BD Biosciences) was used (live, singlet CD3+ CD4-CD8+) among all analyzed samples. IFN+ in the stimulated samples were considered to be the SARS-CoV-2-responsive cells. For high-dimensional analyses of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells among the stimulated samples, we excluded samples with an insufficient number of events ( 3) to limit skewing of the data. Manual gating analysis was initially performed using FlowJo, and then select populations were exported as FCS files and then imported into R software as GatingSet objects. Using the CytoExploreR package, 2D-gates were manually drawn on the imported samples. The 2D dot plots and statistical results were exported for data visualization, bar-graph generation, and statistical comparisons as previously described 2021](#bib16)). High-dimensional analyses (MDS, tSNE, and using R software by implementing a CyTOF workflow recently described [Nowicka et al., 2017](#bib32). For MDS plot generation, we used the plotMDS function from the limma package with default settings. Euclidean distances between all samples were calculated using the arcsinh-transformed median expression levels with cofactor 5, of the lineage and functional markers listed below. MDS dimensions were plotted to show the dissimilarities between samples from the indicated conditions as described [Ritchie et al., 2015](#bib36). tSNE was performed using the Trsne function from the Rtsne package using arcsinh-transformed expression of lineage markers (no PCA step, iterations = 1000,, perplexity = 30, theta = 0.5). Events corresponding to unstimulated T cells were down-sampled to 1000 cells per sample, and SARS-CoV-2-specific cells (cell numbers ranging from 4 to 229 per sample) were all included in the tSNE analyses without down-sampling. Each cell was displayed in a tSNE plot for dimension reduction visualization and colored with arcsinh-transformed cell marker expression as heatmaps, or pseudo-colored by the appropriate group. Unsupervised cell subset was using FlowSOM al., 2015](#bib46) and ConsensusClusterPlus packages using arcsinh-transformed expression levels of the lineage markers indicated above [Wilkerson and Hayes, 2010](#bib49). For clustering of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, we set the meta-cluster number to eight and cluster number to 40. The frequency of each cluster within each sample was calculated using the following equation: (Frequency of cluster in specified sample) = (Cell count of cluster / Total cell count of specified sample). This was then converted to a percentage by multiplying by 100. The percentages of each cluster from the selected samples were plotted as box plots with jittered points, followed by statistical analysis between the groups. To compare the abundance distribution of clusters between groups, frequencies of clusters in samples from each group were normalized using the equation below: (Normalized frequency of cluster in specified sample) = (Frequency of cluster in specified sample/ Total number of samples in each group). This was then converted to a percentage by multiplying by 100, and plotted as stacked bar charts. Statistical analysis [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap72619?item=s4-5) The statistical tests used in comparison of groups are indicated within the figure legends. For 2-group comparisons, student's t-tests were performed and p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Holm-Sidak method where applicable. For comparisons of three or more groups, significance between groups was first evaluated by one-way ANOVA, and then the p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Holm-Sidak method where applicable. For datasets with significant ANOVA-adjusted p-values ( 0.05), we performed Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) post-hoc test to determine the p-values between individual groups. Raw data availability [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap72619?item=s4-6) For this study, a total of 120 specimens were analyzed by CyTOF. Each specimen included both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. For each specimen, we gated separately on events corresponding to CD4+ T cells (live, singlet CD3+ CD4 CD8+), and exported the files as 240 individual FCS files. These 240 raw CyTOF datasets are available for download through the public repository Dryad via the following link: [https://doi.org/10.7272/Q60R9MMK](https://doi.org/10.7272/Q60R9MMK).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work. Acceptance summary: This work will be of broad interest to those studying adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2, particularly with a focus on T cell immunology. The study confirms that mRNA vaccine-elicited T cell responses maintain recognition of peptides derived from VOC, and identifies several phenotypic differences in the T cell response elicited by infection, vaccination, or vaccination following infection. The insights generated by this work will inform further study of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses and their role in supporting protective immunity. Decision letter after peer review: Thank you for submitting your article \"mRNA vaccine-induced T cells respond identically to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern but differ in longevity and homing properties depending on prior infection status\" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Miles Davenport as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Andrew J McMichael (Reviewer #2). The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Essential revisions: 1) Please respond to questions 1 and 2 from reviewer #1, in particular modifying the discussion to address question 1. 2) If there is an opportunity to include any serological data on the response to vaccination among the cohorts included in the study, this would strengthen the paper, as mentioned by both reviewers. 3) Reviewer #2 has highlighted that, as an observational study, the discussion could be strengthened by acknowledgement of how future studies could identify the protective roles of the T cell phenotypes identified in this work. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors): In general, the manuscript is clearly written, the experiments are performed well, and the conclusions are supported by the data. My comments are largely restricted to modifications of the text that can improve the interpretation of the results and discussion of some of the limitations of the study. 1) The authors have chosen to base their identification of spike-specific T cells on IFN secretion, which is understandable. However, given that cTfh cells, in particular, are known to be poor producers of IFN, and also the fact that CD4 T cells may express CD40L or other cytokines in the absence of IFN, it would be useful to briefly discuss the impact this may have on the results 2) Figure 2E appears to show high CCR6 expression on nearly all of the spike-specific T cells - given that these cells were identified by IFN (typically associated with Th1/CXCR3 expression), is it surprising that these cells are enriched for CCR6 expression? 3) Do the authors have serological data from the participants in this study? It would be helpful to confirm whether, similar to other cohorts, the vaccinated convalescent individuals exhibited high titres of neutralising antibodies, and whether there was any association between serological outcomes and the CD4 T cell responses described. Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors): The study raises the question of how these differences affect susceptibility to infection and disease severity. How age impacts on these results is also a further question. However answers to these questions cannot be obtained in small groups such as these and within a study taking months rather than years. Therefore I think it is not reasonable to ask for these additions but instead to encourage the authors too become involved in such studies in the future. What they have presented is detailed and thorough and they have demonstrated some clear differences between their vaccinated donor groups. However the groups are small 5 vs 6, and one of the 6 was an outlier. Expanding the group sizes would increase confidence. Overall the study is very descriptive which is not necessarily a negative thing but it does raise a lot of questions as to what it all means and which of these T cell subsets studied are protective and how. [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72619.sa1](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72619.sa1) Author response Essential revisions: 1) Please respond to questions 1 and 2 from reviewer #1, in particular modifying the discussion to address question 1. We have responded to these questions further below, and have modified the discussion to address question 1 from Reviewer #1. 2) If there is an opportunity to include any serological data on the response to vaccination among the cohorts included in the study, this would strengthen the paper, as mentioned by both reviewers. Serological assays were not performed in this study; however we fully agree with the importance of associating the in-depth phenotypes of vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells with the antibody response. In fact, just as we went very \"deep\" into the phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in this study, we are at the moment optimizing techniques to, in an analogous fashion, deeply characterize the serological response to vaccination. This entails optimizing a flow cytometry-based approach we recently introduced and implemented on a small number of specimens (Ma et al., J Immunol 207(5):1344, PMID 34389625), to be able to simultaneously of IgA1, IgA2, IgE, IgG1, IgG2, RBD domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a large number of patient specimens. Once we've optimized the assay and applied it on the vaccine specimens, we plan to associate the resulting 24-parameter serological datasets (8 isotypes of antibodies each against 3 antigens = 24 parameters total) with the high-dimensional SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell datasets from this study, but that will be its own separate (and large) study and beyond the scope of this current one. As generating such serological data will take at least 3-6 months to complete, and the focus of this study is on SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells (and all conclusions we drew were based only on the T cell data), we think it appropriate that we limit this study to deep-phenotyping of the T cells. We have now brought up in the last part of our \"Limitations\" section the lack of serological analysis in this current study as a limitation, and how follow-up studies should associate serological responses with the T cell responses characterized here. Lines 506-511: \"A final limitation is that serological analyses were not performed in this study. As coordination between the humoral and cellular arms of immunity are likely key to effectively controlling viral replication, future studies should assess to what extent the breadth, isotypes, and functional features of spike-specific antibodies elicited by vaccination associate with the herein described phenotypic features of vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells.\" 3) Reviewer #2 has highlighted that, as an observational study, the discussion could be strengthened by acknowledgement of how future studies could identify the protective roles of the T cell phenotypes identified in this work. We have addressed this point by adding to the discussion how future studies should define the protective roles of the T cells characterized in this study, and that such studies will require animal models (Lines 488-491: \"Such follow-up studies should also examine the functional outcomes of the discoveries made here (e.g., effect of chemokine receptor expression on homing of infection- and vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells), including in animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\"). Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors): In general, the manuscript is clearly written, the experiments are performed well, and the conclusions are supported by the data. We thank the reviewer for the positive comments. My comments are largely restricted to modifications of the text that can improve the interpretation of the results and discussion of some of the limitations of the study. 1) The authors have chosen to base their identification of spike-specific T cells on IFN secretion, which is understandable. However, given that cTfh cells, in particular, are known to be poor producers of IFN, and also the fact that CD4 T cells may express CD40L or other cytokines in the absence of IFN, it would be useful to briefly discuss the impact this may have on the results. In fact our 39-parameter CyTOF panel theoretically allowed us to characterize not only SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells producing IFNg, but also those producing other canonical effector cytokines of IL17 for Th17 cells); however, we did not detect any SARS-CoV-2-specific IL4+ or IL17+ cells, consistent with our prior studies from COVID-19 patients (Neidleman et al., Cell Reports Medicine 2020 1(6):100081 PMID: et al., Cell Reports 2021 34260965). We have now added to Figure S1 the data showing our inability to find any vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific Th2 and Th17 cells. We also note that although CD40L was not on our panel, other activation markers typically used in AIM assays (Ox40, 4-1BB, and CD69) were, and as shown in Figure S1 of our original manuscript, could not be used to specifically identify SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells as the background (AIM+ cells detected when no peptide was added) was too high. Although stimulating with peptide for 24 instead of 6 hours would be expected to increase the ability to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, such a long period of stimulation would also be expected to more drastically alter the phenotypes of the cells from their original baseline state, which we did not want for our phenotyping studies. To acknowledge the limitation of our restricting our analyses to IFNg+ responding cells, we have now added to our \"Limitations\" section our having limited \"our analyses of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells to those inducing IFNg, which may have restricted our ability to characterize subsets such as Tfh cells that are relatively poor producers of this cytokine\" (Lines 491-494). In addition, we have commented that future studies should take advantage of tetramer technology (which would enable analysis beyond just the IFNg-responding ones), whilst acknowledging that such studies would for the most part be limited to CD8+ T cell responses as tetramer reagents for CD4+ T cells are less robust (Lines 500-506). 2) Figure 2E appears to show high CCR6 expression on nearly all of the spike-specific T cells - given that these cells were identified by IFN (typically associated with Th1/CXCR3 expression), is it surprising that these cells are enriched for CCR6 expression? We apologize for the confusion, in fact the heatmaps in Figure 2E were scaled from 0 to the maximal signal within each channel. The overall yellow coloring of the CCR6 heatmap did not mean that all the cells expressed high levels of CCR6, but rather that the dynamic range of CCR6 expression was low relative to other antigens, and most cells shown in the Figure 2E heatmap in fact expressed intermediate levels of CCR6. To illustrate this point, we have shown within [Author response image 1](#sa2fig1) tSNE heatmaps corresponding to total CD4+ T cells from the specimens. This tSNE space was depicted in Figure 2B of the original manuscript. As shown in panel A, the \"island\" at the bottom corresponds to the IFNg+ (SARS-CoV-2-specific) T cells in the stimulated sample; that these cells are mostly Th1 cells is confirmed by their preferentially expressing the Th1 transcription factor Tbet (right side of [Author response image 1](#sa2fig1)). Panel B shows CCR6 expression levels in the same tSNE space, where it's apparent that CCR6 expression is not especially high among the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, but rather somewhat uniform throughout the entire CD4+ T cell population. By contrast, as shown in panel C, two other chemokine receptors (CXCR4 and CCR5) show a much larger dynamic range, where there are were clearer distinctions between the low (blue) and high (red) expressors of these antigens. Consistent with CCR6 being relatively \"uniform\" among all the CD4+ T cells was our visualization of CCR6 expression levels as 2D dot plots, where it's apparent that the highest expressers of CCR6 were in fact not IFNg+ but were IFNglow and infrequent (region highlighted by red arrow within [Author response image 2](#sa2fig2)). In conclusion, it was not the case that the IFNg+ SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were enriched for CCR6 expression, but rather that they expressed moderate levels of CCR6 comparable to that expressed by other CD4+ T cells. We have now clarified within the legend of Figure 2 (Lines 708-709) that each heatmap was scaled from 0 to the maximal signal within each channel. 3) Do the authors have serological data from the participants in this study? It would be helpful to confirm whether, similar to other cohorts, the vaccinated convalescent individuals exhibited high titres of neutralising antibodies, and whether there was any association between serological outcomes and the CD4 T cell responses described.

We thank the Reviewer for bringing up these important points, and for recognizing that we had implemented CyTOF as a discovery tool, and that the discoveries made here will need to be validated, in ways that account for the impact of age and how the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell features defined herein affect susceptibility to infection and disease severity. Such studies will most certainly necessitate not only larger cohorts, but also studies in animal models. We in fact are planning pushing forward on all these fronts. We are collecting patient specimens from additional vaccinated patients (including those with breakthrough infections) to increase our \"n\"; we have initiated studies in a mouse model of pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 infection; and we have upcoming plans (after having received a pilot grant) to characterize vaccine-elicited tissue SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in non-human primates. To highlight the importance of these future studies, we have now in the revised version of the manuscript highlighted the need to perform validation and functional studies in additional donors and in animal models (Lines 486-491: \"The main findings reported here should be confirmed in larger cohorts using more cost-effective and high-throughput alternatives to CyTOF such as conventional flow cytometry. Such follow-up studies should also examine the functional outcomes of the discoveries made here (e.g., effect of chemokine receptor expression on homing of infection- and vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells), including in animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection\").

Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) plays an essential role as a transcription factor in driving the expression of immune response genes during infection. The striking difference in functional output with other IRFs is that IRF1 also drives the expression of various cell cycle inhibiting factors, making it an important tumor suppressor. Thus, it is critical to regulate the abundance of IRF1 to achieve a 'Goldilocks' zone in which there is sufficient IRF1 to prevent tumorigenesis, yet not too much which could drive excessive immune activation. Using genetic screening, we identified the E3 ligase receptor speckle type BTB/POZ protein (SPOP) to mediate IRF1 proteasomal turnover in human and mouse cells. We identified S/T-rich degrons in IRF1 required for its SPOP MATH domain-dependent turnover. In the absence of SPOP, elevated IRF1 protein levels functionally increased IRF1-dependent cellular responses, underpinning the biological significance of SPOP in curtailing IRF1 protein abundance. - - Immunology and Inflammation Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are rising rapidly in urbanizing populations in sub-Saharan Africa. Assessment of inflammatory and metabolic characteristics of a urbanizing African population and the comparison with populations outside Africa could provide insight in the pathophysiology of the rapidly increasing epidemic of NCDs, including the role of environmental and dietary changes. Using a proteomic plasma profiling approach comprising 92 inflammation-related molecules, we examined differences in the inflammatory proteome in healthy Tanzanian and healthy Dutch adults. We show that healthy Tanzanians display a pro-inflammatory phenotype compared to Dutch subjects, with enhanced activity of the Wnt/-catenin signalling pathway and higher concentrations of different metabolic regulators such as 4E-BP1 and fibroblast growth factor 21. Among the Tanzanian volunteers, food-derived metabolites were identified as an important driver of variation in inflammation-related molecules, emphasizing the potential importance of lifestyle changes. These findings endorse the importance of the current dietary transition and the inclusion of underrepresented populations in systems immunology studies. "}
