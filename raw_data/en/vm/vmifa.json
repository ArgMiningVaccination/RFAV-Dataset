COUNCILast spring, when Sean Elliott made one of the mostdynamic plays in San AntonioSpurs history, neither fans norrivals realized what a trulyremarkable athlete they werewatching. He had only recentlyreturned to play from a sidelin-ing knee injury. Elliott was alsofighting a degenerative kidneydisease that was robbing him of his strength and threateninghis life. Elliott, 31, began his NBA career upon graduation from theUniversity of Arizona in 1989,when he was selected by theSpurs as the third overall pick ofthe NBA draft. A native ofTucson, he finished his collegecareer as the all-time leadingscorer in Pacific AthleticConference history. During the1992-1993 season, he was oneof the best all-around players inhis league and was on theWestern Conference All-StarTeam. After being traded to theDetroit Pistons in 1993, hereturned to San Antonio in1994.His career and his scoring average have risen steadily. As astarter on the 1999 NBAChampionship team, Elliottmade a key play in the finalseconds of game two of the 1999Western Conference Semi-finalsagainst the Portland,Trailblazers. It was Elliott'sthree-point shot that gave theSpurs the win. Most of histeammates did not know Elliottwas quite ill when he pulledthem to victory. He had beendiagnosed in 1994 with focalsegmental glomerulorsclerosis, a disease that prevents thekidneys from properly filteringwaste from the blood. He refusedto let his battle with kidney disease diminish his drive as aplayer. \"I just felt I had a responsibility to the team,\" said Elliott in arecent story with the Austin- American Statesman . \"It's been something I 've been living with for a while, so I really didn 't let it creep into my mind that much. \" According to Spurs coach GreggPopovich, Elliott deserves a lot ofrespect for the obstacles he hasovercome. \"Hopefully, people will have an even greater respect forwhat this young man has done,given the circumstances underwhich he had to do it. \" Family has always been an important part of Elliott 's life. Growing up, Sean and hisbrother Noel, now 32,encountered typical siblingrivalry but have alwaysdepended on one another.

Sign Me Up...Executive Editor: Diane Catherine PaykinTransplant Chronicles, Vol. 7, No. 4 3was put to the test last summer when it was discovered that Elliott 's disease had progressed to the point of near kidney failure. Family memberswere screened as potential organ donors. Without akidney transplant, Elliott would have to undergodialysis, a tremendous obstacle for a professionalbasketball player. When the results came in, Noel turned out to be an almost perfect match. Noel Elliott has said that he felt both honored and glad to help his brother in his time of need. \"My brother has always been there for me and I will always be herefor him. The Lord is withus.\" The transplant took place in August. In thebeginning of the 1999- 2000 season, Elliott started travelling with theSpurs as a color commentator. \"I've had a great career, and if that 's the end ofit, so be it. But I don 't really think that 's the end of it,\" Elliott says. Because basketball is such a rigorous sport, doctors want to make sure Elliottwill be protected before letting him back on thecourt. His new kidney was placed in the frontportion of the body, near the pelvis, and he mayneed to wear a protective device to shield it fromcontact on the basketball court. Elliott is excited about the progress he has made to date and hopes to motivate other transplantrecipients to remain active. Besides the obviousphysical challenges a comeback involves, Elliottsays that returning to basketball will be a truemental challenge after undergoing such aprocedure. \"I think it would be a great statement for a lot of people if I could come back and play, \" said Elliott. His dream may be realized sooner thananyone imagined. Elliott was cleared by doctors toreturn to the game and the following evening, justfive months post-transplant, he joined his team fora practice session. He is still awaiting approval bythe Spurs coach and team physicians to get backin the game. If anyone can forge into uncharteredterritory, though, it 's Sean Elliott. At press time he had been cleared by his doctors to resume his ball career and is practicing with theteam. TCSean Elliott ... continued from page 1 Sean plans to return to play this season. Sean Elliott to Serve as Spokesperson for National Kidney Foundation 2000 U.S. Transplant Games San Antonio Spurs forward Sean Elliott, who underwent kidney transplant surgery August 16,will serve as spokesperson for the NationalKidney Foundation 2000 U.S. TransplantGames. This Olympic-style event, to be heldJune 21-24, 2000 in Lake Buena Vista, Floridaat Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex, is for athletes who have received life-saving organ transplantsof every type, including kidney, liver,heart, lung, pancreas and bonemarrow. Transplant athletes willcompete for gold, silver and bronzemedals in 13 different sports,including track and field, swimming,tennis, basketball, cycling and golf. Elliott willlight the torch at Opening Ceremonies andparticipate in the basketball event and medalspresentations. Attendance at the 2000 U.S. Transplant Games is expected to surpass the record-breaking participation in the 1998 Games of5,000 people, including transplant athletes, their families and friends and families of organdonors. Athlete participants range in age fromthree to 75. Fred Herbert, chairman of the National Kidney Foundation, says, \"We're delighted that Sean Elliott has chosen tobecome our Transplant Gamesspokesperson. We know he will makea real difference in helping to get themessage out about the success oforgan transplantation and inspiretransplant recipients, donors andthose people awaiting organs and their families. \" Elliott will join another NBA legend at the Games, Oscar Robertson, who donated a kidneyto his daughter, Tia, a Transplant Gamesathlete. Says Robertson about the Games,Everyone who competes is already a winner inthe game of life. \" TC 4 Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 7, No. 4 he federal Government and the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), thecontractor that operates the national organdistribution system, have enacted leave policiesfor their employees that support living organdonation. There are many times that otherwisewell-matched living donors have been unable todonate due to the threat of lost income whilerecuperating from the donation procedure. It istrue that living donors don 't assume the medical costs of donating, because these costs arecovered by the recipient 's insurance. However, donors have had to deplete their own personalleave or go without any paid leave. Many werenot able to assume the financial hardship andopted out of donating. Others proceeded andexperienced financial and family hardship. Nowthese employees can receive up to 30 days (onemonth) paid leave when they donate an organ,up to 7 days if they donate bone marrow. Patients in need of an organ transplant, primarily kidney transplants, are often asked\"Do you have a living donor? \" The answer to this question can mean the difference between arelatively short wait for a scheduled transplantor waiting several years for a cadaveric donation.Research has shown that kidneys from livingdonors last longer and function better thankidneys from deceased donors. There are severalreasons for this; primarily, a living donor will nothave experienced physical trauma, and the coldischemia time (the time the organ is out of thebody) is at a minimum. The number of livingdonor kidney transplants more than doubledfrom 1,824 in 1988 to 3,793 in 1997. The mostsignificant increase in living donation has comefrom unrelated donors, such as spouses, friendsand in-laws. There is much recent success withliver and lung live donor transplants. Hopefully other employers, both public and private, will follow the example set by theFederal Government and UNOS. Living donationcan make an immediate difference to manypeople needing a transplant. TCLiving Donors Receive Leave Benefits by Charlie Thomas, CISW, ACSW T In Memoriam The NKF is sorry to report that Wayne Nix, a longtime NKF volunteer and patientadvocate, passed away in December1999. Wayne was committed toempowering patients to beinformed and take control oftheir health and quality of life.His motto, \"Dialyze to live,don't live to dialyze,\" was thecore message of everypresentation he gave. Waynechallenged health careprofessionals, asking them toalways motivate and empowertheir patients. Wayne was named chairman of the National Kidney Foundation's Patient andFamily Council in 1999. Under Wayne'sleadership, a formal liaison program withtreatment centers around the country, groundwork for the development of local councils, and regional educational programs for patients all were begun. After receiving a transplant in 1991, Wayne developed a rehabilitation program for patients for the National Kidney Foundation of Michigan. His program in Michigan was adopted by the National Organization and was launched as NKF's Rehabilitation, Information, Support and Empowerment (RISE)program in 1999. We will all miss this very good friend and dedicated volunteer. Wayne NixTransplant Chronicles, Vol. 7, No. 4 5ask the pharmacist Dietary Supplements for Weight Loss by Janet Karlix, PhD, and Phillip Treadwell, PharmD, BCPS he advent of dietary and herbal supplements for weight loss hastransformed the diet industry.These supplements havebecome extremely popular andvery profitable, and manycompanies and individuals enjoythe financial rewards of theirsuccess. With all of the hype aboutthese agents, it is no wonder that many people arecurious about which one of these products wouldbe right for them. There are hundreds of differentbrands of weight loss products available throughdirect marketing, herb and nutrition shops andeven pharmacies and supermarkets. Forconsumers to make an educated choice, isdifficult. The best way to assess any herbal ornutritional product is to look at the ingredient listand determine if the individual ingredients aresafe and effective. We will look at some issuesregarding these various products and try to layout some guidelines for safer use. People who take immunosuppressants must be very careful about the kinds of dietarysupplements or herbs they use in combinationwith these drug therapies. Many herbal medicinesare known to act much in the same manner asprescription drugs, but do not benefit from therigorous study that pharmaceutical agents receiveprior to FDA approval. This leaves a vacuumwithin which we must determine which agentsmay be safe when combined with an agent likecyclosporine. Considering the potentialconsequences of errors made based on a lack ofinformation when choosing a supplement, it isbest to err on the side of caution. Supplements that are designed to reduce weight through simple calorie restriction (e.g., Slim Fast,etc.) are typically safe if used in moderation andaccording to the manufacturer 's guidelines. These products do not attempt to alter the metabolism orinterfere with absorption of nutrients. Therefore,they are very unlikely to adversely interact withmedicines or food. One caution with theseproducts is for people taking warfarin (Coumadin).When taking this drug, you must be very aware ofthe vitamin K content of the supplements you use.Vitamin K content with warfarin must be moderate and consistent. In recent news, weight loss products that contain ephedra have been linked to heart injury.Heart damage and injury of other organs have alsobeen associated with its use. Other stimulantssuch as caffeine may be included in weight lossproducts and are probably safer than ephedra, butstill may induce irregular heart beats or anxietyamong other nuisance side effects. The rest of the nutritional products available for weight loss would be best described asquestionable for transplant patients takingimmunosuppressants. This would includeGymnema sylvestre, Noni (Morinda) and manyothers. These agents may be used by many peoplewithout reports of adverse effects, but peopletaking immunosuppression are a specialpopulation and should approach these agents withcaution. Drug interaction studies have not yetbeen performed and many answers are stillunavailable. Speak to your health care providerbefore using any of these agents and carefullyassess and report any problems that may berelated to the use of these products. This informa-tion can be important for you and others. Phillip Treadwell is a clinical specialist at Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare.TCT High fiber products for weight loss are generally safe becausethey act by providing a feelingof fullness with very fewcalories. Important points toremember with the use of fiberproducts: take them with a full glass (or more) of water to prevent constipation avoid taking them within two hours of medicines to preventpotential problems with absorp-tion of the medicines from yourgastrointestinal tract. Weight Loss and Fiber 6 Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 7, No. 4keeping fit One Size Does Not Fit All by Vanessa A. Underwood, BS, AFAA, ACE o matter how simple your goals, you must choose the type of exercise you do and theintensity of the exercise based on your health,your lifestyle and your personal preference. I wish I could tell you that there is a golden formula, but there are so many variables that willdetermine your workout program. You will needto consider your general health status, genetics,exercise history and where you live in choosingwhat program is right for you. So if you want toget fit, get ready to make some choices aboutyour exercise goals. Remember, before you begin any exercise program or routine, consult with your physician. A basic routine should be simple but structured. As a general rule, you should workout three days a week with at least one day off inbetween, so your muscles can rest and getstronger. An ideal workout would incorporate thefollowing routine and take about 90 minutes. Thisroutine should be your ultimate goal. You canadapt it to your level of fitness and progress eachday until you reach 90 minutes. A 10-minute warm up, to get blood flow to your muscles, walking, stair climbing 5-minutes of stretching, upper and lower body. Hold each stretch 20-30 seconds. 30-minutes of weight training, essential to gaining strength and stamina 30-minutes of aerobic activity, the key to healthy heart and lungs, and for weightmanagement. A 5-minute cool-down. Cut the warm-up pace and activity in half. 5 more minutes of stretching. This can be the same as you did above. But remember I said IDEAL...that doesn't mean if you do 30 minutes or 60 minutes thatyou won 't benefit. Now it 's time to decide how much of each weight you need to lift. In order to decide this,you must determine your goals, and what youwant to train for. Do you want muscles that willgive you short bursts of a lot of strength, or do you want muscles that will give you strength andstamina over a long period of time? For those of you who may want to do some strength training to increase your strength andstamina for competition at the 2000 U.S.Transplant Games consider the followingtechniques: To Build Strength: do a small number of repetitions of fairlyheavy weight to build strength the fastest do 3-5 sets of each exercise per workout do 3-8 repetitions per set use fairly heavy weights (75-85 percent of your one repetition at maximum, that is theheaviest weight or close to the heaviest weightyou can lift at once). Note: you must take a day off to recover and allow your muscles to rebuild. To Build Stamina/Endurance: Muscular endurance is all about not resting. The longer you do this the more you will extendthe time that your muscles and your body canendure any activity. Here is your basic plan forendurance training: lift many repetitions with low weight, do 2-3 sets of each exercise per workout do 12-20 repetitions per set use light weights (defined as 50-60 percent of one repetition at maximum) N Continued on page 15photo credit Jay LaPrete Athletes from the 1998 U.S. Transplant Games.Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 7, No. 4 7ne of the many pleasures and conveniences of receiving a transplant is having the ability totravel comfortably again.

Breakout sessionswill address and make recommendations oninformed consent, long-term follow-up, organspecific medical and surgical challenges andopportunities and needed resources for livingdonors and their family members. The short-term goal is to produce a White Paper that identifies the multitude of issuessurrounding living donation. The long-term goalof the multidisciplinary group is to increase thenumber of lives saved each year by livingdonation and transplantation. Note: Look for updates about the consensus conference on living donation on the NKFWebsite, www.kidney.org TChe National Kidney Foundation (NKF) is organizing yet another exciting consensusconference. The Living Donor TransplantConsensus Conference on the challenges andopportunities of living donation is scheduled forJune 1-2, 2000. The National Kidney Foundationis pleased to partner with the American Society ofTransplant Surgeons and the American Society ofNephrology in this project. The stated purpose ofthe conference is to clarify the medical, psycho-social and ethical issues pertaining to livingdonor organ transplantation. The NKF 's interest in living donation started in 1992, with a conference entitled \"Controversies in Organ Donation. \" That initial conference looked at various ways to increase organ donation, includ-ing financial incentives and living donation.Recommendations from that conference reinforcedNKF's beliefs that something should be done to increase living donation and that it needed to bedone in a responsible way, providing professionalsand prospective donors with accurate information. With the demand for donation continuing to surpass donor organ availability, the NKF felt itimperative that the question, \"Do you have a donor? \" be asked more frequently and routinely. Standardized educational materials for anyonewho might have the potential to be a living donoris also lacking. As part of the NKF 's search for answers and solutions to these questions, a number of focusgroups were conducted with centers who weredoing living donor transplants. Through thesefocus groups, the NKF discovered a need to share protocols on living donation in both themedical and educational arenas. It also foundmuch interest from among the professionaltransplant societies to explore the issuessurrounding living donation. A steering committee was formed to brainstorm the topics and the format for the nationalconsensus conference on living donation.Physicians, nurses, social workers, psychologists,lawyers, the general public (including livingdonors and recipients) make up this steeringcommittee. The proposed two-day conference agenda will include overview presentations from medicalLiving Donor Transplant Consensus Conference 2000 by Laurel Williams Todd, RN, MSNT \"Transitions in Transplantation: A Continuum of Care\" The National Kidney Foundation and the North American Transplant Coordinators Organizationare partnering to present \"Transitions in Transplantation, \" sponsored by SangStat, the Transplant Company. In conjunction with theU.S. Transplant Games, this unique program isdesigned to focus on how transplant profes-sionals assist recipients and donor families dealwith life 's changes. The program, scheduled for June 21-23 in Orlando, Florida, will includespecific topics for procurement professionals,bereavement specialists, transplant socialworkers and transplant dietitians. There will alsobe multidisciplinary sessions to unite and enrichall those working with transplant recipients anddonor families.

Transplant News Digest Winter Edition of Transplant Chronicles resident Clinton signed the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of1999 (H.R. 1180) into law on December 17,1999. The bill contained a provision extendingthe moratorium on implementation of theDepartment of Health and Human Services(HHS) regulation of the Organ Procurement andTransplantation Network (OPTN) for 90 days.The HHS rule is now scheduled to go into effecton March 16, 2000. Transplant News sat down in mid-December with HHS Secretary Donna Shalala to discussthe new moratorium, the Department 's plans for reauthorization of the National OrganTransplant Act, and her thoughts about thecontinued stand-off between HHS and somemembers of the transplant community overimplementation of the HHS regulation. HERE ARE EXCERPTS FROM THE INTERVIEW WITH DR. SHALALA: TRANSPLANT NEWS : For the second year in a row, Congress put a last-minute hold on theimplementation of the regulation. What is thefight all about? Why is it still going on? DONNA SHALALA : I wouldn't describeit as a afundamentaldisagreement what we're is what's patient. Webelieve that a fairersystem, based onmedical criteria,determined by the Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 7, No. 4 9transplant surgeons themselves, is the way we ought to go. We believe we ought to haveconstant improvements as the science changesto make our transplant system better than italready is. We 've had marvelous breakthroughs and the transplant community ought to take allthe credit for these breakthroughs. But we didneed to make improvements in the currentsystem. That's what the new rule's about. TN: One of the ongoing arguments is that the secretary should not be able to make medicalpolicy. That it is best left to the transplantcommunity. And yet you 've addressed that in the regulation and said we do address this inthe regulation. You make the policy. Why is thisstill an issue? SHALALA : I don 't know. There 's still a lot of distrust in the discussion that we're having andwe need to get beyond that distrust because wehave made it very clear that medical decisionsand medical criteria, ought to be determined bythe medical professionals themselves. We haverepeated that over and over again. The onething I can say about this department is that wehave all been consistent in what we've written,and what we've said. And we couldn't have beenclearer. Our whole process has been trans-parent. We 've said this at at least five hearings. I've said it repeatedly, that these decisions ought to be made by medical professionals. TN: Senator Jeff Sessions, one of the leaders in getting the moratorium extended, saidRepublicans cannot allow Secretary DonnaShalala, an unelected bureaucrat on Congress ... You aren 't an elected official \u2014what role should Congress play in this, vis- \u00e0-vis, the department?PSecretary Shalala asks transplant community to trust HHS desire to make transplant system fairer by Jim Warren, editor and publisher 10 Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 7, No. 4dealt with. We need to get over that and focus on the patients and improve the quality of thesystem that we currently have. That can only bedone if we move forward together. And I'm veryconfident that at the end of the day we will infact have a fairer system, a system that's basedmore on scientific evidence and on theremarkable changes that this community hasbeen responsible for. TN: Everyone seems to agree on one thing \u2014if there were enough organ donors to go around,this would not be an issue. Yet many believe,myself included, that the irony is this very publicfight impacts on people deciding not to donate,that it has fed into their fears about the system.How do you respond to this and what would youlike to see happen? SHALALA : First of all, the department and the Clinton administration are vigorously workingwith the transplant community pursuant toincreasing the number of organ donors \u2014both in our rules related to the Health Care FinancingAdministration and Medicare and hospitals, aswell as the national campaigns ... with our partners, the number of organ donations areactually up by six percent. However, all of usfear that if we continue the kind of acrimonythat we've had, that people perceive it, that thesystem is unfair, that that will affect theirbehavior. We cannot take that chance. And weneed to work through the distress that currentlyexists in the system. I pledge myself to do that. Alot of it I will do personally. I know that we canget over this because at the end of the day, thisis about quality health care. This is aboutfairness. And this is about life and death, sofundamental to what all of us care about. TN: If you could say one thing to the transplant community to sum up this issue and what theycan expect for the year 2000, what would that be? SHALALA : We can do this together. We have to restore trust. We have to be able to communicatewith each other. The transplant community has to believe us when we say that we wantmedical criteria to be determined by medicalprofessionals. We have said that repeatedly. Thedepartment has done that repeatedly in a wholeSHALALA : Well, Congress has a key role obviously. We make recommendations for policy.Also the reauthorization of the transplant act inpart Congress 's role. There are different branches of government; we all have differentresponsibilities. The Institute of Medicine (IOM)report has made it very clear that the govern-ment of the United States has a legitimateinterest and accountability responsibility in thisarea for the policies that are made. But look atwhat congress asked us to do. They asked us todo a study by the IOM; we 've done that. They asked us to consult with the transplantcommunity; we have clearly done that. Andthey've asked us to come up there repeatedlyand explain what we're doing and why we'redoing it. We have followed every directive that thecongress has given us, including commentperiods and broad consultations. We followed theguidelines and implemented the recommenda-tions of the IOM. So everything that congress hasasked us to do, we have done. TN: The regulation is now scheduled to be implemented sometime around mid-March. Thatgives Congress about a two-month window tohold hearings on the reauthorization of theNational Organ Transplant Act. What do youexpect to happen and what are your feelingsabout the regulation? SHALALA : I expect those to be a thoughtful set of hearings in which we will again repeat that webelieve the transplant community itself ought toset medical criteria. We have a good system. Itcan be made much better. So we will repeat thatduring the hearings. I expect Congress to take athoughtful look at the existing law in the processof determining the reauthorization of the law. Ibelieve that we will have directives, the kind ofdirectives that we have laid out in our rulesbeing implemented. So, I think that we all oughtto get on with this, because what we're interestedin is the patients. TN: You sound very confident that the regulation eventually is going to be implemented. Are you? SHALALA : We need to work on this issue of trust with the transplant community. There's moredistrust on this issue than any issue I've everset of areas. And there's no reason not to believe that we will do that now. SMALLER LIVER TRANSPLANT CENTERS HAVE HIGHER MORTALITY RATES, ACCORDING TOUNOS STUDY Centers performing 20 or fewer liver trans- plants annually have mortality rates that aresignificantly higher than those of centers doingmore than 20 such procedures each year, butthe public is unaware of these differences,according to a study in the December 30, 1999issue of The New England Journal of Medicine . The one-year mortality rate for the low-volume centers [during the period between January 1,1992 and April 30, 1994] was 25.9 percent, ascompared with 20 percent for the high-volumecenters, reported Erick Edwards, PhD, of theUnited Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) andco-authors from the University of California atSan Francisco, University Hospitals of Cleveland,Ohio, and the University of Iowa College ofMedicine in Iowa City. Thirteen centers, all ofwhich had low volumes, had one-year mortalityrates that exceeded 40 percent, and the rate atone of these centers was 100 percent. The effect on mortality of the number of procedures performed per year was even greaterwhen low-volume centers affiliated with high-volume centers, such as pediatric transplantprograms, were compared with non-affiliatedlow-volume centers. The one-year mortality ratefor the group of all high-volume centers plusaffiliated low-volume centers was 20.1 percent,compared with 28.3 percent at unaffiliated low-volume centers (P<0.01), according to theinvestigators. Presumably, patients requiring liver transplants would steer clear of centers withhigh mortality rates, if they were informed aboutsurvival statistics and had a choice as to wheretheir transplants would be performed. The factthat 837 transplants were done at low-volumecenters during the study period suggests thatthe information available to patients andreferring physicians is inadequate, or thatregional health care systems may be forcingpatients to go to centers with poor results, the authors concluded. Information regarding theoutcomes of liver transplantation attransplantation centers should be made widelyavailable to the public in a timely manner, theyadded. Because organs are distributed geographically, patients at large medical centers tend tolanguish far longer on liver transplant waitinglists than their counterparts at smaller facilities.As a result, the current distribution systemcreates a perverse incentive that drives people tosmaller, less-experienced centers, thus proppingup institutions with higher mortality rates. Thenew Department of Health and Human Servicesregulations, scheduled to take effect in March,could reverse this situation by assuring thatscarce livers are available first for the sickestpatients, who tend to be cared for a large, high-volume university medical centers. RESEARCHERS REPORT MAJOR OBSTACLES TO ANIMAL-TO-HUMAN TRANSPLANTS AREBEING OVERCOME Data presented at a xenotransplant conference held in Boston, MA, in early December suggestthat researchers are making headway inovercoming some of the major obstacles toanimal-to-human transplantation. Scientists BioTransplant, Inc. announced they had developed an inbred group of miniature pigsthat do not pass on porcine endogenousretrovirus (PERV) to human cells in thelaboratory, unlike all other breeds that havebeen tested. Clive Patience, leader of theBioTransplant team, believes the discovery of anon-infecting pig line could eliminate one of thebiggest concerns about xenotransplantation.\"Disease transmission is the last thing any of us wants, \" he said. Two other research groups represented at the meeting said they may be close to producing thefirst clone of an adult pig, a research milestonethat could allow scientists to make copies ofgenetically engineered swine whose organswould be compatible with the human immunesystem. Researchers at PPL Therapeutics, Inc.,the company that created Dolly the sheep, the Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 7, No. 4 1112 Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 7, No. 4first cloned mammal, reported advanced pregnancies with cloned pig fetuses although nobirths yet. Pigs are especially difficult to clonebecause sows need at least four gestatingembryos to maintain a pregnancy, said DavidAyares, PPL 's vice president for research and development. But according to Robert Lanza, ascientist at Advanced Cell Technology, the effortis worth the potential payoff. \"Once we 've cloned the first pig, that will accelerate the whole field ofxenotransplantation dramatically, \" he said. Jonathan Dinsmore of Diacrin, Inc. reported sustained success in treating Parkinsons diseasepatients with brain tissue from fetal pigs \u2014an approach that could avoid the controversy overthe use of human fetal cells. Since trials beganin 1995, Dinsmore said that, on average,patients receiving implants of pig fetal tissuehave improved about 20 percent. With some, thisadvance could mean the difference betweenbeing in a wheelchair and being able to get upand walk. Similar studies are underway for thetreatment of Huntington 's disease and stroke, and Dinsmore foresees applications for epilepsy,chronic pain and spinal cord injuries, as well. Biotech industry leaders predict xenotransplantation could blossom into a $5billion business and relieve the organ shortagesand long waiting lists that today 's transplant patients face. IMUTRAN CONFIRMS PLANS TO CONDUCT HUMAN XENOTRANSPLANT TRIAL IN 2000 A British biotechnology company is planning to perform the first transplants of animal organsinto humans. A senior executive of Imutran confirmed in December that the Cambridge, UK-based firm isholding informal talks with transplant clinicsthat could begin trials of the procedure within ayear. A transplant team lead by Magi Yacoub,MD, of the Harefield Hospital in southernEngland is among those who have discussedxenotransplantation trials. The news came as the UK Xenotransplantation Interim Regulatory Authority prepared to releaseproposed new guidelines on such procedures. They include a ban on all patients havingchildren following xenotransplantation, togetherwith rules governing the welfare of animals bredfor transplants. NEW YEAR BRINGS HAPPINESS IN FORM OF LIFESAVING TRANSPLANT TO 8 LUCKYPATIENTS AT ILLINOIS TRANSPLANT CENTER The cry Happy New Year! took on added meaning at the Loyola University Medical Centerin Maywood, IL, as the institution reportedperforming eight major organ transplant surg-eries, including four on New Year 's Eve and three more during the first four days of the new year. The year-ending series of transplants began on December 30 when a 65-year-old man received aheart transplant. When the amazing run hadended, the surgeries included a liver, a kidneyand two heart transplants in four separatepatients on New Year 's Eve; a second kidney transplant on New Year 's Day; a double-lung transplant on January 2; and a heart transplanton January 4. A woman in her 50s became Loyola 's first transplant patient of 2000 when she underwenta kidney transplant on New Year 's Day. TC Are We Missing You?

WORK INCENTIVES IMPROVEMENT ACT The threat of losing health benefits has been a disincentive for many of the disabled who want towork. Now a work incentives provision is offeringnew hope. The Work Incentives Improvement Actestablishes Medicaid buy-ins that allow thedisabled to work without losing Medicaidcoverage. It also allows the disabled to extendtheir Medicare coverage for up to 78 months.Under the provision, the federal governmentwould cover the cost of Part A Medicarepremiums for disabled people. Additionally, itestablishes a demonstration project to extendMedicaid coverage to individuals with potentiallydisabling conditions. The legislation provides forrehabilitation, job training and placementservices and allows states to provide Medicaidcoverage to workers who are not yet classified asdisabled, but have medical problems that areexpected to become debilitating. NETHERCUTT RESOLUTION A resolution recognizing living kidney donors for their life-saving contributions has passed theU.S. House of Representatives. Introduced byCongressman George Nethercutt (R-WA), HouseResolution 94 also acknowledges the medical andtechnological advancements that have madeliving kidney transplantation a viable treatmentoption for an increasing number of patients withend stage renal disease. TClegislative update ORGAN DONOR LEAVE ACT he House of Representatives and Senate passed legislation that will grant federalemployees additional leave for bone marrow ororgan donation. The House bill, the Organ DonorLeave Act (H.R. 457), was introduced byCongressman Elijah Cummings Daniel Akaka (D-HI). The bill providesseven days of paid leave for bone marrowdonation and 30 days off for organ donation, inaddition to existing sick leave. Previous policyprovided only seven days of leave for organdonation. President Clinton signed the legislationin September. MEDICARE AND MEDICAID REFORM Months of effort by NKF and its affiliates on behalf of transplant recipients have provensuccessful. Congress included a provision in theMedicare and Medicaid Balanced Budget ReformRefinement Act of 1999 to extend Medicarecoverage of immunosuppressive drugs fortransplant recipients. The bill extends coveragefor Medicare-eligible transplant recipients basedon age or disability, for a minimum of eightmonths for beneficiaries whose benefits undercurrent law expire between January 2000 andDecember 2004. The bill authorizes $150 millionfor additional coverage. NKF affiliates and volunteers helped enlist additional cosponsors to H.R. 1115 and theSenate companion bill S. 631. Affiliates andvolunteers conducted meetings with keymembers of Congress or their staffs in their stateoffices and the NKF Scientific and Public PolicyOffice staff met with congressional staff inWashington, D.C. on numerous occasions. TheHouse bill had 264 cosponsors and the Senatebill had 24 cosponsors, with broad bipartisansupport. This support represents approximatelythree times the number of cosponsors who hadsigned on to identical legislation in the previousCongress. T 1999 Legislative Roundup14 Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 7, No. 4eating right Should I Try the \"Protein \" Diet? by Becky Weseman, RD, CNSW, LMNT n the past months, increasing interest has surrounded the high-protein diet. The theorybehind this diet is that it can promote weight lossand also reduce the chance of non-insulindependent diabetes. If you've been considering trying this kind of diet for yourself, there are a few questions you shouldask. What does this diet include? What am I trying to accomplish for myself? Does this way of eatingreally work? What is the risk if I eat this way? Health professionals may not yet know all the answers to these questions. Here are somequestions frequently brought to our attention. What is a fad diet? A fad diet is one that is tried and followed for a short period of time, that is not considered a life-long change in the way of eating and one that doesnot provide all the essential nutrients needed tokeep us healthy. Do people really lose weight by eating a diet consisting only of meat? In fact, many people have tried and lost weight on this altered way of eating. For a fairly healthydieter, following the high-protein diet will oftenresult in a loss of appetite and weight loss becauseof increased water loss. When the body burns itsglycogen stores (a substance stored in the liverand muscles that absorb water) the body is unableto hold on to water. Weight loss that is seen on thescale may be in large part only due to water losswhen this diet is initially started or only followedfor a short period of time. The increased dangerwith this diet comes with following it for aprolonged period of time. Are there any adverse side effects of this diet? When you consume only protein such as eggs, bacon and sausage, steaks and other meats thatwere previously considered taboo to eat in largequantities, your body is forced to break down fattytissue for the production of energy to keep yourunning! But this can throw you into a state ofketosis, a condition in which the body releaseschemicals called ketone bodies in the blood and urine. Being in a state of ketosis is especiallydangerous for pregnant women, people withdiabetes, and people with liver or kidney problems.Being in a state of severe ketosis can increase the acidity of the blood and be deadly. I've heard this diet can eliminate my non-insulin dependent diabetes. Is this true? The idea that a high-protein diet will reduce the risk of non-insulin dependent diabetes by avoidingfoods that cause a rapid rise in blood sugar andinsulin is still being researched by medicalprofessionals. Increased insulin levels in the bloodfrom eating higher amounts of carbohydrates andcausing fat storage and increased cholesterol levelsmay not be this simple. Increased insulin in theblood should not promote fat storage unless aperson eats too many calories. Non-insulindependent diabetes is often a result of insulinresistance, or the inability of cells in the body topick up insulin. For people with non-insulindependent diabetes who are overweight, losingweight by decreasing calories and increasingexercise until they reach a more appropriateweight for their height may be more helpful thansimply restricting their diet to protein. Is this a healthy way to lose weight? Even though a high-protein diet will promote weight loss, it is not a healthy way of eating. Apound of meat each day might seem like a lot toeat, but this is still a low-calorie diet, because onepound of even high-fat meat provides about 1,300calories. Consuming a variety of foods from all themajor food groups but limiting their calories to thislevel would still produce a weight loss, but in ahealthy way that provides vitamins and otherimportant nutrients. Is there a healthy way to diet? Eating a balance of carbohydrates like pasta, bread, cereals, fruits and vegetables along withmeat, milk and dairy products can provide thebalance of energy-producing foods at a low enoughcalorie level to allow for weight loss while stillproviding the energy to think clearly and feel moreenergetic! Remember : If a diet sounds too good to be true it often is. The healthiest way to eat is still byfollowing the guidelines of the Food GuidePyramid! Note : Please consult your physician before you begin any weight loss regiment or diet plan.TCITransplant Chronicles, Vol. 7, No. 4 15poetry corner Prime Candidate by Jeff Degnan The wait is great, for I'm a Prime Candidate.

In the earlyyears of liver transplantation, many patients withlarge liver tumors, which could not be treated byremoving the tumor with surgery, underwentliver transplants. The results, unfortunately,were quite poor; most of the patients died ofrecurrence of their liver cancer within two yearsof their transplant. This group of patients withthis condition were largely abandoned ascandidates for transplantation. Even today, livertransplantation for patients with large livercancers is very limited. However, livertransplantation remains the best possibletreatment for patients who have small (less than5 cm) tumors in a liver that is alreadycirrhotic (damaged by cirrhosis). In fact, evenif the tumor could be treated withsurgical removal, the long-termsurvival was much better in thosepatients who received a livertransplant than those patients whowere treated by simply removing thecancer. Many transplant centers have adopted the practice of screeningpatients who are awaiting liver transplants forliver cancer. This has led to a dramatic increasein the number of patients being discovered withsmall cancers in their cirrhotic liver. Before this,patients with cirrhosis who developed livercancer were given no special consideration in thenational liver allocation system. This meant thatmany patients who had small liver cancers andwho would have been good candidates to receivea liver transplant would have to wait years fortheir transplant. During this time, the cancerswould often grow to such a size that the patientwent from being a good candidate to receive aliver transplant to being a very poor candidatesimply by the size of the cancer.Because the result of transplantation was so good in patients with small tumors and so poorwhen the tumors were large, UNOS recentlyrevised the allocation policy for patients withsmall liver cancers. Now, patients who havecirrhosis of the liver and a small (less than 5 cm)liver cancer are given an additional priority to tryto get them a transplant before their tumorgrows too large. It is too early to evaluate theresults of this policy change, but it certainly willincrease the number of patients undergoing livertransplantation with small liver tumors who canbe successfully treated with this therapy. Patients with tumors that have spread to the liver from other areas (so-called metastatic tumors) have, in the past, been treated with liver transplantation. However,the results of treating patients withmetastatic liver cancer have beenextremely poor, and most transplantprograms have abandoned the use of liver transplantation in treating them. The exception is a small group of patients whose liver cancer is characterized by neuroendocrine tumors, which are very slow growing. While the results of transplantation in this group of patients are notas good as those patients with benign disease,they are still quite acceptable. In summary, liver transplantation is an excellent therapy for patients who develop smallcancers in their cirrhotic liver. These patientsnow are afforded additional priority on thenational liver allocation scheme and appear to do quite well with liver transplantation. Thisgroup of patients represents the major exceptionto the rule that patients with a prior history ofcancer are poor candidates to undergotransplantation. TCTreating Liver Cancer with Transplants by R. Patrick Wood, MD Imedical beat 16 Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 7, No. 4Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 7, No. 4 17Is Managed Care Creating a New Category for Lost Donors? by Teresa Shafer, RN, MSN, CPTC and Ronald N. Ehrle, RN, BSN, CPTC ospitals and physicians work primarily under fixed payment reimbursement systems.The challenge for them is to provide high-qualityhealth care through the efficient use of healthcare services, or as many would say, limiting theuse of health care services in order to preservethe bottom line. Increasingly, the amount of resources expended for the care of a patient who is notgoing to survive a life-threatening injury is limitedin order to avoid expending resources that willnot change the outcome of the injury or illness. Hospitals and physicians may not be aware that decisions to terminate care in the severelyneurologically injured or diseased patient canhave a profound impact on organ donation. It isalready difficult to recover organs from braindead patients where treatment was notterminated early, without theadditional burden of terminatingcare on these patients shortly afteradmission to the hospital. Patientswith massive neurological injuries,who are progressing to brain deathand for whom a physician wouldconsider ongoing aggressivetreatment futile, should besupported for a short period of time,(i.e., 12 to 36 hours). This very brief time allowsthe family not only the time to come to termswith the event, but it also allows them theopportunity to donate life-saving organs toanother individual. A system that encourages aphysician to confer with a family of such patientsearly on about Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) ordersmay be limiting the ability of the family to donate. Early referral of all imminent deaths to OPOs can result in the OPO conferring with thephysician early and asking to continue treatmentfor a period of time. Early notification of the OPOis critical in order to ensure that care of potentialorgan donors not be prematurely terminated. After, the physician informs the family of the patient 's death, the OPO works with the hospitalstaff to pose the question of organ donation to the family. In today 's decreasing reimbursement climate, this process is often turned upsidedown. In a hurried consent process, a physicianor hospital staff person instructs the OPO to askthe family for donation soon after a DNR order iswritten, or worse yet before the patient isdeclared brain dead. The message sent is: If theyare not going to donate, we are going to removesupport; and this may present a confusingpicture to a family whose loved one had beenadmitted to the hospital only hours before. A hospital attempt to reduce length of stays and to avoid futile care expenses is driven largelyby managed care and reduced reimbursement tohospitals for health care expenditures. Thisshortens the treatment time that used to be givento patients with devastating head injuries. Mostfamilies do not wish to prolong treatment for a loved one when it is clear he or shewill not survive. The question ofwithholding resuscitation needs tobe posed at the right time, however.Whenever possible, it should beascertained whether the patient iseligible to be an organ donor beforethe DNR decision is made, sincebrain death normally occurs fairlyrapidly when there is devastating injury to the brain. All of this means that the OPO must be called early following admission of a patient with adevastating event (injury or cerebral hemor-rhage). The OPO can then follow treatment ofthe patient and, along with the physician andhospital staff, offer information, treatment and,ultimately, the opportunity to donate organs tothe family. The impact of managed care on organ donation should be studied in order to developinterventions to prevent the loss due tomanaged care pressures. TCH 18 Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 7, No. 4Between Donor Families & Recipients y brother Ron was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes when he was 11 years old. The last 10years of his life have been marked by medicalcomplications; among them kidney failure. In1997, his kidney failure forced him to go ondialysis. He began to suffer painful bloating ofhis body and he soon was unable to continueworking. In July 1999, he was told he needed akidney transplant. It was very painful for me to see the life being drained out of my younger brother. It was veryimportant for me to do allI could to extend his lifelong enough for him tosee his four beautifulchildren grow up. I knew that the best organ for a transplantcomes from a livingdonor with a blood andtissue type compatiblewith the recipient. I wasquickly tested forcompatibility and inAugust 1999, I found outmy blood type matchedRon's. I then had to talkto my employer about thepossibility of taking acouple of months off fromwork for the surgery andrecovery. With thesupport of my wonderfulemployer, family andfriends, I continued withmore extensive testing.The next two monthswere spent testing my general health and tissuetyping. Soon I received the call from theUniversity of Utah Hospital 's Transplant Coordinator in October telling me that I hadpassed all the medical tests and we needed to set up a date as soon as possible for the surgery.I felt like I had won the lottery! I was luckyenough to be one of those who have directlybeen able to extend the life of a loved one \u2014my 46-year-old brother. On November 5, 1999, my brother and I had the transplant surgery. On November 16 mytransplanted kidney started working for Ron,and on November 23 Ron went home to enjoyThanksgiving with his family. At this point it really hit me and my family that beingalive is a miracle and being aware of yourlife is a gift. Our family has so much to bethankful for this year! Since Ron and I went through the transplant process, my family has becomecloser and more appreciative of each other.I've been experiencing an overwhelming sense of pride and this strange innerpeace. I'm still recovering from the surgery. I am very proud of the scar I wear. I wasback at work full-time in January 2000. Reviewing my 48 ordinaryyears of life,there is onething I haverecentlydiscovered thatwill forever affectmy future \u2014even though we maybe ordinary people, we have the ability to do extraordinarythings. TCMOrdinary Heroes by Lauretta Kelty Ron with hersons andPatrick \u2014post surgery.Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 7, No. 4 19fter receiving a transplant, most of us have thoughts about our donor. In the case where anorgan has come from a living person, it is easy tocommunicate our feelings about the transplantexperience with the donor, who is usually afamily member or close friend. This is trueprimarily in some kidney donations. For themajority of kidney transplants and almost allother organ and tissue transplants, the donor issomeone who has died and whose family hasconsented to donation. This process hastraditionally been anonymous, meaning therecipient does not know the identity of the donoror have the ability to contact the donor 's family. The system that has been set up for recipients to communicatewith the donor family has beenthrough the organ procurementorganization (OPO) thatcoordinated the donation.Recipients can write a letter andgive it to the OPO, which willforward it to the donor family. [Ifthe donor family chose to respond,their letter would be forwarded tothe recipient through the OPO.]Any identifying information wouldbe deleted from eithercorrespondence by the OPO. This includes thingslike last name, phone number, address and anytext that would lead to disclosure of the donor 's identity. For some recipients, this process by itself is enough to discourage them from relaying theirfeelings about their transplant. Some people donot want their words to be read by a stranger inan OPO. For others, however, the biggestobstacle to writing a letter to the donor familyhas been not knowing what to say, or how to sayit. Others need to sort through many mixedfeelings about the recent events. Feelings ofsadness, guilt, happiness and thanks are notuncommon. Surveys of donor families have shown that many families do want to hear how therecipients are doing. The message in this is thatwe, as recipients, should make the effort toexpress our feelings to the family. A simple,short letter can be very effective. A description ofhow the transplant has affected one 's life does not need to be long and involved. The underlyingmessage is usually just \"thank you. \" If a recipient is struck with writer 's block and just can 't follow through with a letter, a simple card can sayeverything needed in two words: thank you. As recipients, we have relied on medical professionals, family members and friends,financial helpers and others who have helped usget to this point in our lives where a transplanthas given us this second chance. But, all of thisoutside help would be useless had the family ofour donor not consented to donation. We need totake the lead in being responsible to ourselves and to the donor family and saythank you in some way. Thisneeds to be done without anyexpectation of return contact. If wenever hear from them, we mustrespect their right to privacy. For information about communicating with donorfamilies there are severalresources available. The NationalKidney Foundation 's Donor Family Council and transActionCouncil Websites (www.kidney.org) both have a lot of greatmaterial including letters. The TransplantRecipients International Organization (TRIO) alsohas sample letters on their website(www.trioweb.org) or you can call them at (800)874-6386. The Transweb Website(www.transweb.org) has a great collection ofstories from donor families and recipients, inaddition to lots of other transplant \u2014related information. Other good sources of information and encouragement are at your transplant center.Coordinators, social workers and most of all,other patients, can relay their own experiencesin writing their donor families. Professionals canhelp a great deal because they have probablyassisted many other recipients in this process.And, the next time you are in the transplantclinic waiting room, ask other patients if theyhave written their donor families. You will find awealth of help and informational tips available to you.
