In 2021, the State of Maryland was allocated $3.7 billion by the Federal Government for American Rescue Plan, State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF). This SLFRF Annual Performance Report describes project performance, highlighting the: Speed that SLFRF were allocated to meet urgent needs during the pandemic emergency. Rate of spending (expenditures) demonstrating SLFRF were distributed quickly to jumpstart the recovery and the progress made over the past year. Equitable use of SLFRF to support disadvantaged and underserved Marylanders, small businesses and nonprofits, education, and industries hit hardest by the pandemic. This report details expenditures from March 3, 2021 through June 30, 2022, and includes planned allocations for state fiscal year 2023 (July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023). In Maryland, SLFRF funds 28 projects, including 89 subprojects. This report includes data collection and project monitoring efforts to ensure the efficient, effective, and equitable use of SLFRF. Exhibit 1 summarizes Maryland's allocation of SLFRF by expenditure group. To -date, Maryland has spent $2.482 billion (or 67%) of the $3.717 billion the state was allocated. State of Maryland 5 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Maryland's Funding Allocation Process When the American Rescue Plan (ARP) became law on March 11, 2021, Governor Larry Hogan and the General Assembly moved quickly to reach a bipartisan spending plan for State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF). Supplemental Budget #5 was introduced by the governor on March 31, 2021 reflecting appropriations for many of the agreed-upon items. Governor Hogan and the General Assembly were confident the spending plan would: Support urgent COVID-19 response efforts to dec rease the spread of the virus Support immediate economic stabilization for households and businesses Address public health and economic challenges that have contributed to the unequal impact of the pandemic on certain populations Replace lost public sector revenue to strengthen support for vital public services and to help retain jobs The U.S. Treasury's Final Rule establishes that American Rescue Plan, State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) can be utilized for: Public health responses for those impacted by the pandemic, including the general public Responses to the negative economic impacts that were experienced as a result of the pandemic Additional services, either as a public health response or a response to the negative economic impacts of the pandemic, for disproportionately impacted communities. Prior to the federal American Rescue Plan (ARP), Governor Hogan championed the RELIEF Act of 2021, which was enacted by the Maryland General Assembly as an emergency bill and signed into law on February 15, 2021. Implemented as 'Recovery Now' projects, the state leveraged SLFRF for many of the projects, and excluded any items in the original agreement that are not eligible based on the Final Rule. Recovery Now projects are labeled in the Project Inventory section of this report. Many of the Recovery Now projects are completed, demonstrating the speed of implementation, timely distribution of funds, and equitable support to Marylanders and organizations in-need. In total, the state has been allocated $9.2 billion from the American Rescue Plan. Outside of SLFRF, $248 million has been allocated through the Homeowner Assistance Fund (HAF) and over $300 million for the Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP) specifically to the Department of Housing and Communi ty Development as part of the American Rescue Plan. Similarly, federal funds for vaccinations, $2.8 billion for K-12 Education , and other federal funds may fall outside of SLFRF. This report focuses on the $3.7 billion allocated for SLFRF. State of Maryland 6 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Key Outcome Goals Since 1999, Managing for Results has been the state's strategic planning, performance measurement, and performance informed budgeting program. Each agency / unit of government is responsible for establishing written strategies and objectives, and then creating outcome and output measures that align to those strategies and to the Administration's priorities. Many of the performance measures in the Managing for Results program are required as part of legislative reporting. In total, the state reports on approximately 4,000 performance measures annually. This established performance measurement process put Maryland in a strong position to set clear and measurable goals for deployment of SLFRF. Outcome goals for SLFRF: Improvement in health outcomes by addressing inequity in health care access and quality Reduced cancer and heart disease mortality rates Reduced infant mortality, with a focus on reducing the gap between infant mortality rates for African Americans and other races Improving the percentage of births with first trimester care Reduction in poverty, food insecurity, and utility debt Increase in the number of local workforce development board clients placed in employment Decrease in th e percentage of families and people whose income in the last 12 months was below the poverty level Decrease in the prevalence of households with very low food security Reduction in statewide utility bill arrearages Improved educational outcomes through school infrastructure improvement, broadband access expansion, and programs to address pandemic learning loss Increase in the four -year high school graduation rate Increase in the number of households with access to broadband internet services Stabilization and growth of Maryland's economy through support to small businesses and industries most negatively impacted by the pandemic Comparison of Maryland's unemployment rate to the national average Increase in Maryland's Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Increase in state sales tax revenue attributable to tourism State of Maryland 7 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Use of Funds Maryland allocated SLFRF to 28 projects.

Specific health disparities targeted by the new projects include diabetes, asthma, heart disease and hypertension, mental health, substance use disorder, maternal and child health, and Sickle Cell Disease. Reduce Negative Economic Impacts: In February 2020 (pre-pandemic), Maryland's unemployment rate was 4.2 percent. Two months later it rose to 9.5 percent. As of June 2022, the state's unemployment rate was at 4.0 percent, two tenths of a percent from the pre-pandemic rate. As of May 2022, Maryland's labor force participation /total employment was 97.5 percent of February 2020 levels. Reduce Negative Economic Impacts: As of the fourth quarter of 2021, Maryland's Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was at 99.2 percent of its reading from the fourth quarter of 2019 (pre-pandemic). GDP is the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis' most comprehensive measure of state and county economic activity. Emergency Financial Assistance: The number of individuals participating in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program increased from approximately 25,000 pre-pandemic to a high of over 57,000 during the state of emergency. The state used SLFRF to help support these individuals and families. Emergency Financial Assistance: Electric and gas utilities, as a result of increased arrearages (late bills), were allocated $83,000,000 in SLFRF. The 2021 Maryland Public Service Commission Annual Report describes statewide arrearages have dropped back to approximate pre-pandemic levels for most utilities. And the number of customers experiencing payment difficulties is well below historical averages. Pandemic related unemployment claims depleted the Unemployment Insurance (UI) Trust Fund. As of September 27, 2021, Maryland paid off its federal UI loan balance with SLFRF as allowed under the U.S. Treasury's Final Rule and Senate Bill SB 811. This action avoided the federal unemployment insurance tax credit reduction that was set to trigger in 2022, replenishing the UI Trust Fund with $830 million. Investments in Infrastructure: On August 20, 2021, Governor Larry Hogan announced the launch of Connect Maryland, a transformative new initiative to supercharge the State of Maryland's broadband investment with a total new investment of $400 million to fully address the digital divide. \"The State of Maryland has set an ambitious goal of ensuring universal broadband to everyone in every single corner of the state by no later than 2025, and Connect Maryland is the game- changing initiative th at is going to get us there,\" said Governor Hogan. \"This is just one more shining example that we aren't just committed to fully recovering from the pandemic, but we are committed to coming back even stronger and better than ever before.\" SLFRF Projects 5A and 5B are part of Connect Maryland. State of Maryland 15 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Community Engagement and Promoting Equitable Outcomes Agency priorities for the use of SLFRF were strengthened by the state's existing capabilities for engaging Marylanders to understand problems and develop solutions, with an emphasis on promoting equitable outcomes. Three examples include the Vaccine Equity Task Force, Pathways to Heath Equity, and Utilities Financial Assistance for Vulnerable Marylanders. Vaccine Equity Task Force In 2021, Governor Hogan created the Maryland Vaccine Equity Task Force (VETF) , led by the Maryland National Guard, to work with the state's 24 local health departments to focus COVID-19 vaccination efforts on underserved, vulnerable, and hard- to-reach populations to ensure the equitable delivery of vaccines, including minorities and non-English speaking populations. Maryland's GoVAX campaign has leveraged resources with close ties to key co mmunities, including the state's Vaccine Advisory Group, the Governor's Office of Community Initiatives , the state's network of Medicaid providers, and public sector and community partners. The following chart illustrates that as of July 11, 2022, vaccinations for White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian populations are higher in Maryland than they are nationally. Source: Vaccination data based on Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) analysis of available data on state websites; total population data used to calculate rates based on KFF analysis of 2019 American Community Survey data. Number of states included in analysis varies based on available data at time of data collection; Data as of 7/11/2022; Sorted by size of population; retrieved from kff.org State of Maryland 16 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Pathways to Health Equity In 2021, the Community Health Resource Commission (CHRC) , Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities (OMHHD) , and the Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients (CRISP) led the implementation of Maryland's new Health Equity Resource Communities (HERCs) . Throughout the state, HERCs help to engage communities and to prioritize programs for equitable public health. HERCs are the result of the Maryland Health Equity Resource Act, approved in 2021 to provide significant new grant funding and state resources for local communities to address health disparities, improve health outcomes, expand access to primary care and prevention services, and help reduce health care costs. Utilities Financial Assistance for Vulnerable Marylanders On July 8, 2020 the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) initiated Public Conference 53 to assess the impacts of COVID -19 on Maryland utilities and customers, including accumulated arrearages (late bills), service terminations, and other financial and administrative challenges, and to explore regulatory actions to mitigate those impacts. The Commission held public hearings on the accumulation of large arrearages as a result of COVID-19. Community engagement led to the adoption of using SLFRF to pay customer late bills, prioritizing those in -need, including Marylanders in Home Energy Assistance Programs and people with special medical needs including from COVID-19. Community engagement also helped ensure a reporting mechanism w as in place so that utilities would report back to PSC once late bills were paid with SLFRF, including the type, amount, and address so that the Commission could analyze the results to ensure the program hit its mark. As a result, $83,000,000 in SLFRF we re allocated to pay late utility bills for Marylanders in - need. Over 150,000 customers received support. There are many more examples described in the Projects Inventory section about how Maryland was able to leverage existing capabilities for community engagement and promoting equitable outcomes to prioritize the timely use of American Rescue Plan, State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds. State of Maryland 17 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Project Expenditure Groups The remainder of this report details each of the seven (7) allocation expenditure groups defined by the U.S. Treasury .

State of Maryland 18 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Improving Public Health Projects: Section Overview Public health is the science of protecting and improving the health of people and their communities. This work is achieved by promoting healthy lifestyles, researching disease and injury prevention, and detecting, preventing, and responding to infectious diseases. Overall, public health is concerned with protecting the health of entire populations. These populations can be as small as a local neighborhood, or as big as an entire country or region of the world. 1 What is Health Equity? Health equity exists when all people, regardless of race, sex, sexual orientation, disability, socio -economic status, geographic location, or other societal constructs have fair and just access, opportunity, and resources to achieve their highest potential for health. 2 Since 2004, the Maryland Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities (OMHHD) has a mission to address social determinants of health and eliminate health disparities by leveraging the Department's resou rces, providing health equity consultation, impacting external communications, guiding policy designs, and influencing strategic direction on behalf of the Secretary of Health. The Office's vision is to achieve health equity where all individuals and commu nities have the opportunity and access to achieve and maintain good health. The Maryland Community Health Resources Commission (CHRC) was created by the Maryland General Assembly in 2005 to expand access to health care services in underserved communities. The CHRC is an independent commission operating within the Maryland Department of Health (MDH), whose 11 members are appointed by the governor. Since its inception, the CHRC has awarded 648 grants totaling $111.9 million, supporting programs in every jurisdiction of the state. These programs have collectively served more than 517,000 Marylanders, and grants awarded by the CHRC have enabled grantees to leverage $31.8 million in additional federal and private/non-profit resources. The CHRC supports the work of community health care resources and fulfills its statutory mission in the following activities: 1. Awarding grants to expand access in underserved areas and support public health priorities; 2. Staffing the Maryland Council on Advancement of School- Based Health Centers ; 3. Supporting the State's Diabetes Action Plan through the provision of assistance to Local Health Improvement Coalitions; 4. Implementing the provisions of Senate Bill 496 - Recovery for the Economy, Livelihoods, Industries, Entrepreneurs and Families (RELIEF) Act by providing emergency grant funding to Title 7 Developmental Disabilities Administration Providers for re -opening, transformation, or revenue loss; 1 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; CDC Foundation; Website link - https://www.cdcfoundation.org/ 2 Health Equity Leadership & Exchange Network, 2020; Retrieved from - https://healthequitytracker.org/whatishealthequity State of Maryland 19 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 5. Establishing the Pathways to Health Equity Program/ Health Equity Resource Communities under the Maryland Health Equity Resource Act of 2021 6. Establishing the Maryland Consortium of Coordinated Community Supports under the Blueprint for Maryland's Future ; and 7. Providing ongoing technical assistance to CHRC grantees, other programs, and executing other special projects. In 2021, the Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities (OMHHD), the Maryland Department of Health (MDH), and the Maryland Health Care Commission (MHCC) focused efforts to improve data collection, analysis, and reporting of health disparities. State laws w ere updated to include additional requirements for collaboration, establishment of an inventory of health disparities and a clearinghouse / database to manage them, and enhancement of the frequency and detail of health disparities reporting in the executive branch and to the legislature. An initial annual report was provided in December 2021 titled House Bill (HB) 309 / Senate Bill (SB) 565: Health Disparities Legislative Report. The state also established the Maryland Commission on Health Equity. Over the next two years, the Commission will establish a comprehensive plan for the elimination of minority health disparities. Innovations in Health Care and Human Services Maryland is an innovative leader in public health with the state's \" Total Cost of Care \" (TCOC) payment program and the state's cross-agency gateway to Health and Human Services, MD THINK . Unique among American states, Maryland requires that hospitals receive the same payment for specific treatm ents delivered to Medicare, Medicaid, commercially insured, or self- pay patients under a global budget covering all hospital and non-hospital costs. Over the five-year period 2015 through 2019, Maryland's standardized per- capita Medicare spend declined from 1 percent above the national average to 1 percent below, with improvement in many quality metrics. Global budgets create powerful incentives for hospitals not to overcharge or overtreat. In a recent report by Fair Health 3, among all 50 states Maryland had the lowest average costs for complex COVID-19 hospitalizations. At $49,127, Maryland's cost was just under half the national average of $98,139 and over $20,00 less than the next lowest- cost state (Arkansas).4 Maryland's payment system also helped mitigate the financial impact of COVID-19 on hospitals. During the early months of the pandemic's economic lockdown, when hospital revenue plunged nationwide due to a sharp falloff in visits and elective procedures, Maryland's hospitals experienced inpatient and outpatient revenue declines of just 1.6 percent and 15 percent, 3 COVID -19 Treatment and Hospitalization Costs; A FAIR Health Brief; 12/15/21 4 Meaningful Value -Based Payment Reform, Part 1: Maryland Leads The Way; Emanuel, Ezekiel J.; Johnson, 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report respectively.5 This moderation of revenue flows occurred because Maryland's Health Services Cost Review Commission granted hospitals the latitude to temporarily raise prices to make up for volume shortfalls. As operations normalized, hospitals lowered prices to keep the ir overall spending within global budget parameters. An analysis of the first two years of the TCOC program found some significant improvements particularly in the areas of care management, access, and continuity. In the first performance year of Maryland 's TCOC model, the state reduced spending by $365 million, relative to national trends, according to a Mathematica implementation report . Maryland's Total Human- services Integrated Network (MD THINK) is a cross -agency collaboration between the Department of Health, Department of Human Services, Department of Juvenile Services, MD Health Benefit Exchange, and the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. The solution enables Marylanders to apply for and manage a host of integrated health and human services. Modern technology provides for a great user experience, and case worker artificial int elligence helps to identify government programs and services that people are in -need to receive. For example, a family on Medicaid and receiving Temporary Assistance for a Disability may also trigger an alert for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance and other emergency social services. The state utilized MD THINK to help get SLFRF to Marylanders in -need, especially to disproportionately impacted populations. On July 7, 2022, Governor Larry Hogan announced the launch of the Center of Excellence on Health and Human Services Analytics and Applications as the latest development for MD THINK and delivers on the governor's promise to enhance data analytics to enable state agencies to deliver better service to Marylanders. \"In 2017, when I announced the launch of MD THINK, I recognized the need for state agencies to have access to better technolog y and data to support their business decisions,\" said Governor Hogan. \"MD THINK is a national model for using a cloud-based data system to improve the delivery of health and human services, and the establishment of the Center of Excellence will take MD THI NK to the next level by allowing more robust and sophisticated data analysis to inform business operations.\" 5 Hospital Revenue Under Maryland's Total Cost of Care Model During the COVID -19 Pandemic, March- July 2020; (JAMA Network); 2022 American Medical Association website.

On December 17, 2020, Governor Larry Hogan announced that Medicaid long term care and behavioral health provider rate increases, pursuant to Maryland Senate Bill 280 (2019), would go into effect January 1, 2021. With the support of SLFRF, an additional 2% increase to Maryland Medical Assistance reimbursement rates ($26 million) was provided to nursing facilities for dates of service on July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022. Many different groups of people may be eligible for Medicaid in Maryland. As part of health reform, Maryland expanded Medicaid to nearly all adults under age 65 with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level or about $1,564 per month for a household of one person in 2022. Medicaid covers the cost of long term care in nursing facilities for low income individuals who meet Medicaid eligibility, medical, and financial requirements . There are approximately 230 nursing homes and 30,000 beds that can be utilized in the Maryland Medicaid Nursing Home Program . Home and Community- based Services (HCBS) providers received a separate increase from the American Rescue Pl an outside of SLFRF, including a 10% enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (eFMAP). State of Maryland 23 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Intended Outcomes Continued operation of and sufficient staffing for nursing home facilities to meet the on- going need for care for senior Marylanders. Maryland residents have access to services for COVID and non -COVID medical needs. Health providers maintain their ability to serve the public throughout the pandemic, with no net loss in services due to pandemic revenue loss or cost increases. Statewide public heal th will stabilize during pandemic recovery. 1A.1 - 2% Nursing Home Temporary Rate Increase The temporary 2% rate increase was based on nursing facilities' Medicaid reimbursement. Funds were delivered by way of the Medicaid Management Information Systems (MMIS) . Awareness for the project was communicated through engagement with nursing facility stakeholders and associations, including Nursing Facility Liaison Committee members, the department website, and in written communications. Funding amounts were a llocated to providers based on their Medicaid revenues for the previous two fiscal years. The goal of the temporary rate increase was to provide assistance to nursing facilities across Maryland with maintaining operations and keeping residents and staff safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence-based interventions beyond Medicaid eligibility requirements were not relevant to the award criteria. 1A.2 - Recovery Now - Maryland Department of Health - Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) P rovider Grants This project assisted developmental disabilities providers with costs incurred from pandemic related reopening, for example, revenue loss and transforming services to meet pandemic requirements. Applications from developmental disabilities providers were due on May 10, 2021. The state received 117 applications that were approved June 4, 2021, and a second round of 44 awards were approved on June 24, 2021 totaling $5 million. Grants were awarded to providers across the state on a non- competitive basis. The Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) partnered with the Community Health Resources Com mission (CHRC) to distribute grant funds to eligible providers based on agreed criteria. The CHRC and DDA released a joint memorandum to advise the provider community of the funding opportunity. After the initial application period ended, CHRC staff worked with providers to apply for funding.

Calling 988 will connect callers directly to the National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline which encompasses all behavioral crisis services, to include mental health and substance use (problems with drug and alcohol use). Background Pre-pandemic statistics: One in five adults experiences a mental health condition every year and one in seventeen lives with a serious mental illness. Adults in the United States living with serious mental illness die on average 25 years earlier than others, largely because of treatable medical conditions. 50% of those with mental illness experience its effects by age 14 and 75% by age 24, making early engagement and support critical for effective intervention. There i s a well-documented link between substance use and mental health disorders as approximately 7.9 million adults in the United States have co -occurring disorders. 7 In January 2019, Lt. Governor Rutherford announced Executive Order 01.01.2019.06 , signed by Governor Hogan, establishing the Commission to Study Mental and Behavioral Health in Maryland . The commission, which is chaired by Lt. Governor Rutherford, has been tasked with studying mental health in Maryland, including access to mental health services and the link between mental health issues and substance use disorders. The commission includes representatives from each branch of state government, representatives from the state Department of Health, Public Safety and Correctional Services, and Human Services, as well as the Maryland State Police, the Maryland Insurance Administration, the Opioid Operational Command Center, and six members of the public with experience related t o mental health. 7 Executive Order 01.01.2019.06; State of Maryland, Executive Department; Commission to Study Mental and Behavioral Health in Maryland; retrieved https://governor.maryland.gov/wp- content/uploads/2019/05/EO - 01.01.2019.06- Commission of Maryland 26 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report The COVID -19 pandemic has increased prior concerns about mental health. Survey data suggests that economic anxiety, feelings of loneliness, and depressive disorder are on the rise\u2014four in ten American adults now report feelings of anxiety or depression, up from just one in ten prior to the pandemic. 8 In addition, these effects have been disproportionately felt by essential workers, who are more likely to report feelings of anxiety, depression, and substance use as well as represent communities of color. 9 A Kaiser Family Foundation report from February 2021 noted that one in five essential workers recently reported that they have \"seriously considered suicide in the last 30 days,\" compared to eight percent of nonessential workers. In addition, 25 percent of essential workers report that they have increased use of or started use of substances to cope with stress, compared with 11 percent of non- essential workers. 10 Nearly 50 percent of individuals of color in recent surveys reported feeling depressed. This may be attributed to the fact that members of these communities have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, are more likely to be essential workers, and have historically had more difficulty in accessing behavioral health care. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has long recognized the importance of providing access to qualified professionals who can respond in real- time to mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) crises. Community-based mobile crisis intervention services were first developed in the 1970s and have become a key element of an effective behavioral health crisis continuum of care. The main objectives of community- based mobile crisis intervention services are to provide rapid response, individual assessment, and crisis resolution by trained mental health and substance use treatment professionals and paraprofessionals in emergency situations that involve individuals who are presumed or known to have a mental health condition or SUD . With the provision of these intervention services, individuals can be linked to additional services immediately. Project Description This project provides financial assistance for mental health crisis service providers to address revenue shortfalls due to the pandemic and addresses increased demand for services. The project will ensure all current mobile crisis, stand -alone walk -in crisis, and other mental health crisis services providers can continue essential services. Uses support the increased deman d for behavioral health services due to the pandemic through an accelerated cost of living provider rate; increase to cover additional personnel costs, supplies, and other expenses; and revenue shortfalls. With a community -based crisis intervention approach, mobile crisis teams assess individuals in the community where they are experiencing a behavioral health emergency and de- escalate the 8 Kaiser Family Foundation.

This enables the state to deploy appropriate medical professionals to situations where previously law enforcement would have been the only option available. 11 These services also promote cost effectiveness, and there is evidence that they reduce unnecessary emergency department visits and hospitalizations. 12 Timeline The first round of applications for mental health crisis service providers closed in April 2021, with a total of $3.9 million requested and $3.1 million awarded . An additional $2.3 million in awards were made in fiscal year 2022. Intended Outcomes The SAMHSA National Guidelines for Behavioral Health Crisis Care describe three core components of a robust crisis system as follows: (1) a 24/7 clinically staffed call center that can serve as the hub of an integrated mental health crisis system; (2) mobile crisis response teams that can respond rather than law enforcement, and (3) crisis receiving and stabilization facilities that provide short- term services and can be accessed readily rather than relying on emergency departments or hospital environments. 13 Community Engagement The Commission's Crisis Services Subcommittee (CSS) was formed to identify gaps in Maryland's crisis response system and to make recommendations on addressing these gaps. The CSS was charged with studying how the statewide crisis system operates in order to identify opportunities for creating a more comprehensive system of care. In February 2021, the Behavioral Health Administration (BHA), in partnership with the Opioid Operational Command Center (OOCC), created the Maryland Crisi s System Workgroup (MCSW) to help Maryland establish an integrated, comprehensive crisis response system. This workgroup, composed of 75 diverse stakeholders from around Maryland, included representatives from state and local government, providers, advocates, and people with lived experience. MCSW met five times during 2021. Five workgroups were established as part of the MCSW: Data Dashboard; Best Practices/Standardization; Financing Sustainability; Children/Adolescents/Young Adults; and 988 Integration. 11 3 CSG Justice Center.

It is funded annually from criminal fines, forfeited bail bonds, penalties, and special assessments collected by U.S. Attorneys' Offices, federal U.S. Courts, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. To date, fund dollars have always come from offenders convicted of federal crimes, not from taxpayers. For Fiscal Year 2022, the federal government cut funding by 38% to the state's Victims of Crime Act fund. On July 22, 2021, President Biden signed the VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act of 2021 ( VOCA Fix) to stabilize the fund. Earlier that year, the Maryland General Assembly passed budget language that outlined restrictions for VOCA funding recipients, including that no funding to state agencies may be awarded until each victim services provider has been awarded funding at no less than the same level as fiscal year 2020. State of Maryland 29 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report SLFRF provides valuable short-term funding to ensure the impact of victim services is sustained during the pandemic. This project includes 4 subprojects: 1C.1 - VOCA Community Services Coordinators 1C.2 - VOCA New Future Bridges Subsidy 1C.3 - Safe at Home Address Confidentialit y Program 1C.4 - VOCA Victim Services 1C.1 - VOCA Community Services Coordinators The Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS) has historically received funding from the VOCA grant to support the salaries of four (4) Victim Services Coordinators. SLFRF provides assistance to support the short- term needs for the coordinators. Victims Services Coordinators are contractual employees hired to respond to telephone inquiries from crime victims and parole and probation agents regarding court ordered restitution and domestic violence services. Prior to the pandemic, the employees funded by this grant would also accompany victims to court for protective order hearings, arrange for emergency services for victims of domestic violence, and other public health services. Use of Evidence Restorative justice is not only an aspect of public health, it also plays an important role in economic mobility. Results For America's Economic Mobility Catalog 14 describes the correlation between community-based vic tim services for restorative justice and economic mobility. Victim Services Coordinators provide support and safe communities that help family stability by providing timely information to victims and their family members following an act of violence. From the crime scene, to investigation, trial / sentencing, the offender is housed at a state correctional facility, offender parole hearing, eligibility, and release date, offender on community supervision, sex offender registry. As a victim, having access to a Community Services Coordinator to provide information about the courts and the offender at each stage in the justice process plays a valuable role in restoration for the victim and their family. For example, contacting the Victim Services Coordinator to learn about a convicted offender's status, relay concerns about inappropriate contact by the offender, and to request mediated dialog. Contact the Victim Service Coordinator to learn about parole eligibility, upcoming hearings, and exercise your right to be present. SLFRF helped to continue their work without disruption during the pandemic. 14 Justice and Public Safety Strategies to Strengthen Communities; Results For America; Economic Mobility Catalog; 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 1C.2 - VOCA New Future Bridges Subsidy The New Futures Bridge Subsidy (NFBS) Program is a short -term rental subsidy program available to survivors of domestic and/or intimate partner violence, sexual assault, or sex trafficking, and youth aging out of foster care who have been victims of neglect and/or abuse. The NFBS Program works with victim service providers to assist in the stabilization of program participants into safe, decent, and affordable housing as they navigate towards restoration. A housing navigator is assigned to each program participant. The housing navigators work with participants on setting goals, provide assistance with locating housing, address barriers to housing and identify financial resources. The housing navigator also acts as a liaison between the program participant and the owner and/or property manager. Participants of the NFBS Program receive a monthly rental subsidy, paid directly to their landlord. Participants are also assisted with security deposits as we know that these lump sum payments are often a barrier to obtaining housing or relocating to a safe location. All participants are eligible to receive up to $500 in utility assistance, as large utility balances have also been identified as a barrier to obtaining and maintaining housing. The New Futures Bridge Subsidy Program provides direct outreach to victim services providers throughout the State of Maryland. The Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) and victim service providers enter a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that clarifies the roles and responsibilities of each party to ensure that program participants are receiving services to ad dress their individual needs. Timeline Each program participant is eligible for twelve months of rental assistance. COVID -19 has exacerbated and caused several delays in participants' ability to transition to self -sufficiency. The lack of affordable housi ng and inflation have created additional barriers in participants obtaining goals set early on. Households have been offered an additional twelve months of assistance. This will allow additional time to work towards goals set for program participants. Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners The NFBS Program currently has eight victim service provider agencies under MOU. These provider agencies conduct screening of eligible applicants and submit electronic applications to the NFBS Program. Housing naviga tors conduct virtual or telephone interviews with applicants. During the initial meeting, program applicants and their case manager are informed about the program guidelines and applicant income and household information is collected. Background checks are conducted on program participants. Once an applicant is determined to be eligible for the program, the housing navigator works with the participant to set goals and begin the search for housing that is appropriate for the family. The housing navigator wor ks with the landlord to execute the housing contract and to ensure that the unit is inspected prior to the family moving in. State of Maryland 31 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Housing navigators conduct 30, 60, and 90-day meetings with the participant to ensure a smooth transition into the housing unit. The housing navigator also works with the participant to address progress made with goals. Intended Outcomes The NFBS Program's primary goal is to ensure that victims of crime have access to safe, decent, and affordable housing as they navigate towards restoration. Many successful program participants have exited the program to long-term housing options. Use of Evidence The NFBS Program was a program designed under the Victims of Crime Act. This program has been successful in transitioning over 400 victims into the rental housing market, while ensuring that the services needed are in place. This program has not been evaluated. 1C.3 Safe at Home Address Confidentiality Program The Maryland Safe at Home Address Confidentiality Program (ACP) is administered by the Office of the Secretary of State and provides an important service to victims of domestic violence and human trafficking. The goal of the ACP is to help those individuals, who have relocated or are about to relocate, to keep their perpetrators from finding them. Victim services professionals work with program participants to safely enroll. SLFRF helped to ensure continuity of the program during the pandemic. The program has two components: First, the ACP provides a substitute address for victims who have moved or are about to move to a new location unknown to their abuser. Second, the Program provides participants with a free confidential mail- forwarding service for first-class mail and legal papers. Address confidentiality programs protect victims of domestic violence, human trafficking, stalking, and sexual assault by providing the victim with a substitute address to use as their legal residential, school, or work address to prevent abusers and traffickers from locating their victims. Address confidentiality programs exist in most states. With the passage of Senate Bill 25 and House Bill 1056 during the 2006 legislative session, Maryland became the twentieth state to adopt an address confidentiality program. In 2014, the Maryland General Assembly passed Senate Bill 818 and House Bill 559 which expanded the program to victims of human trafficking. State of Maryland 32 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 1C.4 - VOCA Victim Services The Governor's Office of Crime Prevention, Youth, and Victim Services is using SLFRF to provide funding to the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) program . The VOCA program works to improve the treatment of victims of crime by providing them with the assistance necessary to aid their restoration after criminal violence and support as they move through the justice process. Timeline Program participants are eligible for reimbursement for medical care resulting from alleged rape sexual assault, or child sexual abuse. Funds are also used for Crisis Intervention Teams (CIT) to implement the crisis intervention model program, and to expand evidence-based practices in up to 14 jurisdictions to establish regional navigators to comply with the Child Sex Trafficking Screening and Services Act of 2019. The Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for regional navigators was issued with a deadline of proposals due July 29, 2022. The timeline will vary for these three separate projects. Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners Level of access for regional navigators are offered by eligible entities such as designated Child Advocacy Centers (CACS), Rape Crisis Centers and other community-based nonprofit organizations. Sexual reimbursement claims are maintained under confidentiality. Intended Outcomes The purpose of regional navigators is to ensure that law enforcement agents and local Departments of Social Services can obtain needed services for a child who is a victim of sex trafficking in each of the 14 jurisdictions without a navigator.

Funds may be used to support AMDC operations in areas such as staffing expansions, procurement of supplies, and COVID-19 testing and therapeutics, as well as general operational expenses to continue providing health, social, and related support services to functionally disabled adults, ages 16 and older. The intent of providing this funding to AMDC providers was to ensure that functionally disabled adults in the state continue to receive critical and necessary services and receive such services in a safe environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. A ll AMDCs in the state (Medicaid or non - Medicaid enrolled) were able to submit a letter of intent and participate in this opportunity if they met the eligibility criteria. The grants have been awarded to 99 AMDC providers in the state. These AMDCs were to use the funds to stay operational during the COVID-19 pandemic. The awards were distributed based on license capacity of the AMDCs. MDH partnered internally with the Office of Health Care Quality (OHCQ) and externally with the Maryland Association of Adult Day Services (MAADS) to identify the organizations and to verify licensing information. Grant funds are able to be used from the date of receipt (March 11, 2022 in most cases) through December 31, 2022. A preliminary report identifying expenditures to date was due on July 1, 2022. A final report is due on January 1, 2023 outlining expenses through December 31, 2022. Any unused funds are to be returned to MDH by February 1, 2023. The close of the grant period is February 28, 2023. Based on the grant a greement, there are no additional performance requirements imposed on the AMDCs to report to MDH. 1D.2 - Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning Upgrades for Public School Buildings This subproject provides funding for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning upgrades for public school buildings to be allocated among school systems using the same criteria as the State of Maryland's Healthy School Facility Fund (HSFF) . This includes projects that will improve the conditions related to air conditioning, heating, indoor air quality, and temperature regulation. Intended Outcomes Improved health and safety for students, faculty and staff in Maryland's K-12 public schools School environments that promote learning and lead to better educational outcomes for students Improved equity when comparing the maintenance needs of schools across all Maryland LEAs State of Maryland 35 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report The purpose of the Healthy School Facility Fund is to provide grants to public primary and secondary schools for capital projects that will improve the health of school facilities. This includes projects that will improve the conditions related to air conditioning, heating, indoor air quality, mold remediation (including pipe insulation to prevent condensation causing mold), temperature regulation, and plumbing (including the presence of lead in drinking water outlets in school buildings). Replacements and repairs to roofs and windows are also eligible for project funding. Grants will be p rioritized to projects that correct issues posing an immediate life, safety, or health threat to occupants of a facility. Grants will be administered by the Interagency Commission on School Construction (IAC), an independent commission that functions within the Department of Education. The HSFF received $30,000,000 in funding in FY 2021, 2022, and an additional $40,000,000 from SLFRF. The mission of the Interagency Commission on School Construction is to achieve a safe, healthy, and educationally sufficient learning environment for every child attending a public school in Maryland. The IAC 's vision is a fiscally sustainable statewide portfolio of K -12 school facilities that will remain educationally sufficient for current and future generations of students and teachers. By serving as a resource for best practices and as a statewide expert in facilities operations and management, the Commission supports Local Education Agencies of every size and in every unique situation, to meet the facilities needs of approximately 1,400 school facilities that serve close to 900,000 students in Maryland. Project Activities The project will be implemented in accordance with Education Article \u00a75 -322, Annotated Code of Maryland, which requires the Interagency Commission on School Construction (IAC) to administer the HSFF, approve expenditures, and develop administrative procedures for the grant program. The Administrative Procedures Guide (APG) provides all the details regarding implementation and administration of the program. A revised HSFF APG was adopted by the IAC at its meeting on August 12, 2021. The revisions to the current HSFF program are related to the Built to Learn Act of 2020 and statutory changes to ineligible projects/expenditures. The final APG is available on the IAC website at mdschoolconstruction.org . In accordance with Education Article \u00a7 5 -322 (j)(iii), Baltimore City will receive at least 50% of funds appropriated to the fund in Fiscal Years 2021 through 2024 through a separate application process specifically for Baltimore City. The IAC distributes the available funds based on a competitive application process for the 23 other local educational agencies.

Some of the allowable activities th at can be conducted to support local health department infrastructure include: Making improvements to facilities to meet pandemic operational needs, such as physical plant improvements to public hospitals and health clinics or adaptations to public buildings to implement COVID -19 mitigation tactics. Hiring personnel for roles that may range from senior leadership positions to early career or entry -level positions and to support key administrative functions. Making investments in current local health department employees: grow the workforce through training, professional development in leadership The intended outcomes are to strengthen public health infrastructure, including the public health workforce. Grant funds are awarded to local health departments through the standard Unified Funding Document (UFD) at the beginning of the state fiscal year. Approved work plans for state FY22, with an obligation of $738,697, include following activities: Personnel salaries & benefits Personnel trainings Provision of health services via a mobile health clinic, to include vehicle purchase & maintenance Repair & maintenance of buildings and equipment Clinic upgrades Other administrative costs, including office supplies, computer equipment, software and indirect cost (no more than 10% of direct cost) State of Maryland 38 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Timeline 7/15/2022 3/9/2022 to 6/30/2023 Awards were made to subrecipients Application submission, review and approval for FY22 budget and work plans Application submission, review and approval for FY23 budget and work plans Project implementation and spending Project close-out, etc. to follow Use of Evidence Somerset County identified through their 2018-2019 Community Health Needs Assessment that poverty, low health literacy, transportation barriers, and lack of insurance coverage are the biggest barriers to healthcare access. The goal of their grant proposal is to improve health outcomes with a mobile wellness program that will allow reach to underserved areas by taking services such as COVID testing, vaccines, reproductive health services, prevention education, immunizations, referrals and linkage to care directly to the county residents. The Charles County Department of Health Mobile Integrated Health (MIH) program offers patients the option of having a healthcare team \u2014 a nurse, paramedic, and community health worker \u2014 visit a patient's home to ensure they reach wellness. The Charles County MIH program began bridging the gap of social determinants of health and delivering tailored healthcare to its target community in August 2017. Of the first 24 patients that met program criteria, the MIH program achieved a 74 percent reduction in emergency department visits and an 84 percent reduction in inpatient hospital admissions. The MIH team is empowering their patients' independence through wellness and improved healthcare. In 2018, Governor Hogan awarded the Charles County MIH with a Governor's Citation for Excellence in Customer Service. Performance Performance measures for FY22 activities: Number of staff hired/retained with FY22 grant funding Number of accounting systems upgraded Number of disease investigations Number of Community Health activities/services provided Number of Community events held to offer and promote services Number of mobile vaccine clinics Number of vaccinations given Number of trainings provided to staff Conference opportunities provided to staff State of Maryland 39 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 1D.5 - Medicaid - Nursing Homes This subproject addresses urgent staffing needs and funding for activities to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in nursing homes. Funds were awarded to facilities for the following purposes only: 1. Stabilize and increase staff at the Grantee's facility, including but limited to recruitment costs, training costs, salaries and benefits related to backfilling lost positions and newly created positions, retention and bonus pay and HR support. 2. Support increased testing for Grantee's employees, residents. patients and visitors; to help minimize the spread of COVID -19 within the nursing home and support the wellbeing of employees, residents, and patients. 3. Activities to increase COVID -19 vaccination (primary and booster series) rates of Grantee's staff, residents, and patients to mitigate the spread of COVID -19 within the nursing home and to include education on COVID-19 vaccines, and costs associated with administering COVID -19 vaccines. 4. To provide financial support for the nursing home's continued response to the COVID- 19 pandemic including, the supply or access to costs associated to administer COVID- 19 medical therapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies or COVID- 19 antiviral medications. 1D.6 - School Reopening Grants The Reopening Schools project provided funds to local education agencies (LEAs) to ensure the safe reopening of schools for the 2021-2022 school yea r. The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) required LEAs to develop and submit a Reopening Plan during the 2020-2021 school year. Priority was provided to LEAs that had submitted a Reopening Plan. Research has shown that in -person instruction is far more effective for students than virtual instruction. Safely reopening schools is in the best interest of all students, and most important for traditionally underserved communities. LEAs used the grant funds for a variety of activities necessary to sa fely reopen and operate schools during the Pandemic. Examples of activities include: Purchase PPE, hand sanitizing stations, water bottles, air purifiers and replacement filters Musical instrument bell covers Summer interns to prepare student devices for deployment Additional custodians and supplemental cleaning services and supplies Additional school health staff to support testing, contact tracing The funds were available in July 2021. The grants end on 12/30/2024. The Reopening Schools Grant required an application, budget narrative and a link to the LEA's Reopening Plan. MSDE issues grants to LEAs. LEAs report expenditures on a monthly basis and MSDE reimburses the reported expenditures.

The incentive was used to increase the number of state employees vaccinated for COVID-19. It was administered through payroll for employees that showed proof of vaccination. 1F.2 - VaxU Scholarship s This project provided teenagers with a chance to win a $50,000 scholarship to college for getting vaccinated. The promotion was designed to raise awareness and increase the number of Marylanders vaccinated for COVID -19. Nine (9) statewide drawings offered vaccinated residents ages 12-17 a chance to win one of twenty (20) scholarship prizes. Winners received a scholarship in the form of a Prepaid College Trust or College Investment Plan from the Maryland 529 college savings plan . Individuals 12-17 who provided a Maryland address at the time of vaccinations and have received the COVID -19 vaccine were automat ically entered into the promotion. The 20 winners of the $50,000 VaxU Scholarship were selected between July 12, 2021 and September 6, 2021. More information is available on the project's website - VaxU Scholarship Promotion . State of Maryland 42 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Reducing Negative Economic Impacts Projects : Section Overview Of the 90 SLFRF subprojects, approximately half of them are with Commerce Subcabinet agencies. Established in 2015, the Commerce Subc abinet is comprised of the: Department of Commerce Department of Transportation Department of Labor Department of the Environment Department of Housing and Community Development Department of Planning Governor's Office of Small, Minority, and Women Busine ss Affairs Maryland Higher Education Commission Department of Natural Resources Smart Growth Department of Assessments and Taxation The Subcabinet advises the governor on proposals to enhance the state's business climate; gathers information the Subcabinet considers necessary to promote its goals; collaborates to facilitate and expedite critical economic development projects in the state; and provides other assistance that may be required to further the goals of the state and enhance its business climate. This cross -agency collaboration was valuable to the timely, prioritized allocation of SLFRF. Reducing Negative Economic Impacts Outcome Measures Outcomes measure economic recovery from the pandemic. Outcomes do not need to be entirely attributed to SLFRF projects, as many factors contribute to economic recovery. SLFRF is helping to move the needle. SLFRF has an impact on outcomes. How much of a relationship there is between SLFRF project activities and outcomes is open to interpretation. This report helps to serve that purpose. The following outcome measures are used for Reducing Negative Economic Impacts: Real Gross Domestic Product (GD P) by County and Industry Statewide Labor Force Participation Rate Statewide Unemployment Rate Jobs Created and Retained by County and Industry - Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) GDP by county is the value of goods and services produced by the county's economy less the value of goods and services used up in their pr oduction. It is the sub- state counterpart of the nation's GDP. It is the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA's) featured and most comprehensive measure of U.S. economic activity. State of Maryland 43 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report GDP by county statistics can be used by business and policymakers to identify the economic drivers in a county. The statistics also provide county officials and planners with important new information for allocating resources and designing new economic development strategies. GDP by county statistics can als o help researchers study the industry composition of local economies and the long- term effects of development policies. The map below shows the change in GDP by county between 2019 and 2020. GDP decreased in most of Maryland's 24 jurisdictions, although G DP did rise slightly in two counties. The next update will contain 2021 data. It is expected to be released in December 2022 and will provide valuable insight into how local economies are recovering. Percent Change in Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), 2019 - 2020 Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis Labor Force Participation Marylanders are hard workers. The state boasts the 13th highest labor force participation rate in the country. Even at the height of pandemic shutdowns, Maryland had a higher percentage of its adult residents participating in the labor force than the current national average. In the past year, a robust job market and rewarding job opportunities have also drawn Marylanders back to the labor force at a rate exceeding the national one. As a result, Maryland is pulling even further ahead of the nation as measured by the percent of adults in the labor force. Note that labor force participation remains below pre -pandemic levels, both nationally and in Maryland. State of Maryland 44 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Demographers and ec onomists are beginning to find evidence that much of this drop is due to retirements from the labor force. The Maryland Department of Labor has commissioned a study, due for publication in 2023, to investigate changes and the long term prognosis for labor force participation in Maryland. Labor F orce P articipation R ate, Maryland and United States Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Unemployment The unemployment rate is an imperfect, if important, measure of economic conditions through the pandemic period. Individuals are considered unemployed if they are without a job and actively looking for work. Unemployment in Maryland peaked in April 2020 at 9.5 percent - the highest level on record for Maryland since the data began being collected in 1976. Since then, the unemployment rate has steadily dropped and now sits at just 4.0 percent. This compares quite favorably with the average unemployment ra te of the past 20 years, 5.3 percent. Unemployment has been above 4.0 percent in more than three quarters of months during that time. Despite the strong current state of the economy, the state is committed to helping all individuals find meaningful employm ent, if they desire. Below are two maps of county unemployment rates. Both share the same color scale. Darker red represents relatively higher unemployment rates, while darker green shades represent lower unemployment rates. Recessions in the past 40 yea rs have reached an average peak unemployment rate of 7.1 percent. This level of unemployment is shaded white. State of Maryland 45 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report The first map shows the unemployment rate in April 2020, when most counties hit their highest level of unemployment. All but one county saw une mployment rates worse than the average recession from the past 40 years. The second map shows unemployment as of May 2022. All counties have reduced their unemployment rate. Furthermore, all counties matched or improved on the long term statewide average u nemployment rate of 5.3 percent. Unemployment rate (%) - April 2020 Unemployment rate (%) - May 2022 State of Maryland 46 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report As indicated by the labor force participation rate discussion above, many individuals either chose or were unable to work during the pandemic. As they were not actively looking for work, they were therefore not considered unemployed. As a result, the unemployment rate both understates the severity of the impact on Marylanders, and the degree of economic recovery for these working age individuals. Similarly, the state's current unemployment rate may be tricky to interpret given the unique economic climate. W hile it is relatively higher than the national average, this rate combined with the underlying trend in Maryland's labor force participation rate indicates that the economic recovery, a hot labor market and high wages are drawing people back to work at a r ate exceeding the national average. Jobs Created and Retained by County and Industry There are multiple sources for analyzing jobs created and retained in Maryland. For example, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes the monthly Current E mployment Statistics (CES) at the statewide level. Private industry, for example payroll company ADP, also provides statistics on jobs created and retained more frequently and at a more granular level down to zip codes and industries. For this report, we use the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW). It is one of Maryland's best economic indicators, as it includes all jobs covered by Unemployment Insurance, and is considered the gold standard for accuracy. Published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor S tatistics, it is the most granular jobs data released by BLS and shows data down to the workforce region by industry. Due to its comprehensive scope, QCEW data is updated through the end of 2021, as of this writing (July 2022). Data for 2022 will begin to come out later this year. More recent statewide data for 2022 is taken from Current Employment Statistics, a complementary product produced by the BLS in conjunction with the Maryland Department of Labor. A quick and decisive response by the state at the beginning of the pandemic led to 86 percent of jobs being retained through the low point of the accompanying recession. This matches the national rate of job retention, despite the robust steps taken statewide to combat the early spread of COVID -19. Through May 2022, Maryland has regained or added 334,200 jobs from the pandemic low in April 2020, representing a net recovery of 83 percent of jobs lost. In 2020, many companies continued to shed jobs even as the broader economy began to make a comeback, s o these broad figures likely underestimate the true degree of recovery experienced in Maryland. State of Maryland 47 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Employment I ndex, United States and Maryland (February 2020 = 100) The map below shows job retention rates by county using February 2020 as the baseline, and April 2020 as the low point of the pandemic -driven job losses. Job retention in Maryland counties varied from 66 percent to 92 percent. The following map shows job recovery, as a percent of jobs lost at the start of the pandemic. By the end of 2021, 9 counties have already recovered, on net, all jobs lost during the onset of the pandemic. Job retention and job recovery appear to not be meaningfully correlated - som e of the most resilient counties have seen the strongest rebounds, while others are still recovering. However, all counties have recovered at least two thirds of the jobs lost, and in under two years. In comparison, the economic recovery following the 2008 recession took more than 5 years to reach a similar level of progress. Support from federal dollars and local area efforts from 2020 onwards almost certainly played a major role in the much faster recovery. State of Maryland 48 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Job Retention by County, February 2020 - April 2020 (net percent) Jobs Regained by County, April 2020 - December 2021 (net percent) State of Maryland 49 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Looking at industry employment data tells a similar story - Significant strides have been made across the board despite significant setbacks in 2020. The chart below looks at the same jobs retained and jobs regained metrics described above. Jobs retained m easures what percentage of jobs remained on payroll in April 2020, compared to February 2020. Higher numbers indicate that fewer jobs were lost. Jobs regained looks at what percent of jobs lost between February and April 2020 were regained by December 2021. Numbers above 100% indicate that, on net, all jobs lost in that industry have since been recovered. Of the major industries tracked, 8 have regained more jobs than they lost at the start of the pandemic. Four industries regained more than 140% of jobs lost. In the chart below, the bars for these industries have been truncated. Jobs Retained and Regained, on net The Maryland Department of Labor has been tracking more detailed recovery measures by industry within each county, and has promoted the availability of this analysis to workforce partners and the general public to help inform recovery efforts. Analysis through the end of 2020 is available at the publications page on the Maryland Workforce Exchange in the Annual Economic Reports section. A similar analy sis, looking at employment metrics through the end of 2021, will be made available at the same URL by October 3, 2022. Next, let us examine each project.

These outreach activities included not only our 30,000 newsletter subscribers, but outreach to every legislator, nonprofit groups, churches, chambers of commerce, minority chambers of commerce, various associations, etc. State of Maryland 51 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Equity Related Awareness, Access, and Distribution There were no administrative requirements that would have resulted in disparities in the ability to complete applications or meet eligibility requirements. We had staff readily available to answer questions. 2A.1 - Recovery Now - Department of Commerce - Hotel, Motel, and Bed and Breakfast Grants To support Maryland hotel, lodging, and accommodation businesses facing continued financial impacts from the novel coronavirus, the state established through bipartisan legislation the Maryland Lodging and Accommodations COVID-19 Relief Grant Program. Commerce provided $10 million to the local jurisdictions through the Maryland Economic Development Assistance Authority and Fund (MEDAAF) for lodging and accommodation businesses in their areas. The purpose of the program was to enable the local jurisdictions to make grants to eligible accommodations within the jurisdiction to promote and e ncourage stabilization within the hospitality industry. Applications were made available through each county and Baltimore City for up to $25,000 to hotels and motels (except casino hotels) or bed- and-breakfast inns categorized as North American Industria l Classification Codes 721110 and 721191, respectively. If the establishment was part of a multiple -location franchise, it was required to be owned by a local franchisee. Recipient businesses were required to demonstrate a need for assistance, with priority given to businesses that had not received prior funding through MEDAAF. Intended Outcomes Stabilize industries most negatively impacted by the pandemic and enable businesses to continue operations. Retain jobs in Maryland's hospitality industry. Timeline Commerce sent out grant agreements to the jurisdictions on March 24, 2021. By May 28, 2021, all jurisdictions had signed and returned their grant agreements. The counties were required to update Commerce's online portal with grant recipient information by July 31, 2021, to include the following: Name, location, and FEIN of each grantee; Amount of grant received by grantee; Use of grant proceeds; and Demographic information responses of each grantee.

State of Maryland 53 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 2A.2 - Recovery Now - Department of Commerce - Restaurant Grants To support Maryland restaurants facing continued financial impacts from the novel coronavirus, the state established through bipartisan legislation the Maryland Restaurants and Caterers COVID-19 Relief Grant Program. Commerce provided $22 million through t he Maryland Economic Development Assistance Authority and Fund ( MEDAAF) to the local jurisdictions to provide relief to restaurants in their areas, with a portion set aside for economically disadvantaged establishments. Applications were made available through each county and Baltimore City for up to $12,000 to accommodations providers that were primarily engaged in activities that, in accordance with the North American Industrial Classification System, would be included in Code 722320 (Caterers), Code 7224 (Drinking Places (Alcoholic Beverages)), or Code 7225 (Restaurants and Other Eating Places), be in good standing with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation (SDAT) and demonstrate a need for assistance. Priori ty was given to businesses that had not received prior funding from MEDAAF. Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners The Maryland Economic Development Assistance Authority and Fund (MEDAAF) provides funding to local governments for grants up to $12,000 t o qualified applicants. The target was that at least 15% of the amount should be distributed to disadvantaged businesses. Priority was to be given to businesses that have not received prior funding from the MEDAAF. Intended Outcomes Stabilize industries most negatively impacted by the pandemic and enable businesses to continue operations. Retain jobs in Maryland's hospitality industries.

The Maryland Tourism Development Board, in the Department of Commerce, used SLFRF to market Maryland small businesses for tourism. Destination Marketing Organizations (DMO) in each county, Baltimore City and Ocean City received grant agreements on March 22, 2021. As of May 14, 2021, all had signed and returned their agreements and Commerce had distributed all funds. This program provided grants to advance the economic recovery and resiliency of communities where the travel, tourism, and outdoor recreation industries were hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The 25 officially recognized DMOs were awarded funds so that they can invest in inviting residents and visitors back to restaurants, entertainment venues, wineries, breweries, attractions, shops, and services in communities across the state. This was specifically focused on opportunities where the industry benefits from visitor spending, including events designed to encourage overnight travel and events surrounding hospitality training and workforce development. Small Business Marketing Grants by County 2A.4 - Recovery Now - Live Performance The Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) administered over $45 million in funding for the Governor's Maryland Strong Economic Recovery Initiative . These funds supported the state's nonprofit tourism organizations, entertainment venues, and businesses in the sta te's designated Main Street Maryland communities and Baltimore City's designated Main Street neighborhoods. $10,000,000 in SLFRF provided grants to live entertainment venues or promoters of live performances. Grants were prioritized to those who closed or canceled live performances due to capacity limitations in response to the pandemic. \"As we continue to move forward in our recovery, I am proud to announce more support for these entertainment businesses and venues as part of our Maryland Strong Economi c Recovery Initiative,\" said Governor Hogan. \"These awards protect jobs and preserve important cultural institutions in Maryland communities ready to get back to normal.\" Applications were accepted from nonprofit and for-profit live entertainment venues and promoters of live performances. Seventy applications were submitted, requesting $22,643,269. DHCD made 63 awards based on the criteria defined in Recovery Now. On June 16, 2021, Governor Hogan announced the awards . All payments were processed by June 30, 2021.

There are three (3) subprojects: 2B.1 - Recovery Now - Commerce - Local Commuter Bus Assistance Grants 2B.2 - Recovery Now - MARBIDCO - Rural and Agricultural Business Grants 2B.3 - Rural and Agricultural Business Grants Intended Outcomes Stabilization and continued operation of commuter and shuttle buses so that Marylanders have needed transportation services Stabilization of agricultural and rural businesses throughout the state Increased utilization of food benefit programs at Maryland farmers markets State of Maryland 57 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 2B.1 - Recovery Now - Commerce - Local Commuter Bus Assistance Grants Priva te commuter and shuttle bus operators were negatively impacted by a reduction in service by the Maryland Transit Administration during the pandemic. These operators are essential to provide transit services to residents who rely on them to get to work, school, health care facilities, and more. Grant awards were provided to address revenue shortfalls; ensuring these operators did not shut down permanently and could continue to serve the Maryland neighborhoods that rely on them. Private commuter and shuttle buses are often utilized by Maryland's vulnerable populations, including those who cannot afford personal vehicles for their families, people with disabilities, and the elderly population. In collaboration with the Maryland Transit Administration, the Depa rtment of Commerce sent grant agreements to the six (6) eligible local bus operators on March 22, 2021. By April 14, 2021, all six had signed their grant agreements. By May 12, 2021, Commerce distributed all $8,000,000 to the companies. State of Maryland 58 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 2B.2 - Recovery Now - MARBIDCO - Rural and Agricultural Business Grants This project supports the recovery of Maryland's rural and agricultural businesses with $2 million in SLFRF for targeted grant programs administered by the Maryland Agricultural and Resource-Based Industry Development Corporation (MARBIDCO) . MARBIDCO established six distinct grant programs to provide immediate pandemic adjustment and economic development assistance to agricultural and rural businesses in Maryland. Grant application deadlines were on April 1, 2021 and May 15, 2021. Funds were distributed by June 30, 2021: Maryland Shellfish Aquaculture Relief Grants - provides grants of up to $2,000 to Marylan d Shellfish Aquaculture leaseholders (oyster farmers) that hold one or more leases from the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to help with spring production costs. Oyster farmers experienced significant revenue losses during the pandemic and are required by law to maintain certain production on their leases. Application deadline was May 15, 2021. MARBIDCO received 94 applications. Ninety -two applicants qualified for $138,500. Maryland Urban Farmer Relief Grants - provides grants of $500 to urban farmers to help with spring production costs. Urban farmers must be located in urban areas and have had at least $1,000 in annual agricultural product sales. Application deadline was May 15, 2021. MARBIDCO received 19 applications requesting $9,500. MARBIDCO a pproved 11 applications for $5,500. Local Food Cold Storage Relief Grant Program - provides up to a 50 percent matching grant up to $15,000 to farmers and watermen to assist with costs related to the purchase and installation of cold storage equipment. Many farmers adjusting operations during the pandemic have needed cold storage facilities to better serve new or existing markets. The application deadline for Round 1 was April 1, 2021. MARBIDCO received 100 applications requesting $955,853 of grant funds. MARBIDCO approved 78 applications totaling $372,321. However, five have withdrawn their applications due to being approved for less grant funding than expected for their projects. Currently, MARBIDCO has 73 approved Cold storage grantees with grants totaling $347,708.

Grant funds can be used to purchase livestock processing equipment and/or upgrade facil ities to help expand production capacity in Maryland and help reduce the processing backlog that occurred during the pandemic. The application deadline for Round 1 was April 1, 2021. MARBIDCO received 24 applications requesting $1,255,554 of grant funds. MARBIDCO approved 24 applications totaling $615,958 of grant funds. Maryland Wood Products Industry Equity Incentive Relief Fund - provides grants of 20% to 33% of a project's cost (with 25% as a target) up to $225,000, with the aim to help forest harve sters and wood fiber processors to purchase new equipment or construct facilities to increase the utilization and production of wood products in Maryland. The program will provide much needed assistance to a struggling Maryland forestry industry that has b een affected by recent mill closures and the loss of wood fiber markets. The application deadline for Round 1 was April 1, 2021. MARBIDCO received 21 applications requesting $1,894,594 of grant funds. MARBIDCO approved 21 applications totaling $749,951 of grant funds. Maryland Market Money Program - provides grant funding to the Maryland Market Money Program that offers benefits to food insecure Marylanders. Those eligible for Special Supplemental Nut rition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and the Farmers Market Nutrition Program (FMNP) may use those benefits at farmers markets to purchase fresh food directly from local farmers. These grant funds will be used during the spring farmers' market season at various markets located around the state. Since it was established in 2004, MARBIDCO has offered assistance to qualifying farms and rural businesses in securing affordable capital and credi t for equipment, commercial facilities, real estate purchases (often by partnering with commercial lenders ) and assists with rural working land preservation (by serving as a financial intermediary for state and local land conservation organizations). As a result, MARBIDCO was well suited to market the grant programs to rural and agricultural organizations, as well as individual farms and businesses throughout the state. Some of these partners included the Rural Maryland Council and the Southern Maryland Agr icultural Development Commission (SMADC). SMADC manages the Maryland Market Money program at farmers markets across the state. State of Maryland 60 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Use of Evidence The pandemic disproportionately impacted low- income families, and there was a marked increase in demand for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has recognized this need by enacting emergency increases in its food assistance programs. 15 Performance Number of businesses provided financial relief grants, including name, industry, award amount, location, FEIN, zip code, demographic information Breakdown of use of grants MARBIDCO Grant Awards by County, Zip Code, Program Name and Business Type MARBIDCO Grant Summary, as of June 25, 2021 Description Amount Awarded Disadvantaged $253,396 Not Disadvantaged $842,575 Error in Zip Code $5,500 Total $1,101,472 Percent Disadvantaged 23%* *Calculated using the 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 2B.3 - Rural and Agricultural Business Grants This project provided $1,500,000 to support the recovery of Maryland's rural and agricultural businesses through targeted grant programs administered by the Technology Development, Transfer, and Commercialization program in the Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO) .

Project Restore provides financial support to Maryland's new or expanding businesses to help incentivize commercial investment in vacant retail and commercial properties. Property Assistance grants support rent, mortgage, property insurance, or utilities. Business Operations grants support sustaining and growing the business in the previously vacant property. Funds can be used to support staff costs, capital improvements, marketing, inventory, and supplies, utilities and the like and cannot be used for executive salaries or bonuses. The Project Restore Dashboard contains relevant performance information. State of Maryland 63 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report The Maryland Department of Commerce administered the following two SLFRF projects to provide financial assistance to small businesses facing financial hardship. These projects are also part of the state's RELIEF Act of 2021, Recovery Now. Their intended outcomes are to retain and increase jobs created by small businesses and to provide the equitable distribution of funds across a diverse group of business owners and regions. Prior to accepting applications, Commerce developed a marketing and outreach strategy to spread the word about the new funding as broadly as possible so businesses from across the state were ready to apply whe n the applications were made available. Outreach activities included emailing our 30,000 newsletter subscribers and outreach to every state legislator, nonprofit groups, churches, chambers of commerce, minority chambers of commerce, and various association s. 2C.2 - Recovery Now - Department of Commerce - Maryland Small, Minority, and Women -Owned Business Account (SMWOBA) This project provided an infusion of $10 million in SLFRF into the existing Maryland Small, Minority, and Women-Owned Businesses Account ( SMWOBA ). The account provided grants to eligible fund managers to provide investment capital and loans to small, minority, and women- owned businesses in the state. Each fund manager was allocated $1,250,000 to make loans or grants. Funding was distributed before July 1, 2021.

Alert #3 sent to over 30,000 people and organizations that the application was now open. Commerce reached out to undersubscribed county officials and legislators. Commerce extended the online application portal to May 24th and continued outreach. Commerce reached out to the applicants who were prequalified, but had not submitted their application reminding them of the deadline. All funding was distributed. There were no administrative requirements that should have resulted in disparities in ability to complete applications or meet eligibility requirements. Commerce had staff readily available to assist businesses with questions. Community Engagement Commerce had several v irtual meetings with the fund managers at the beginning of the pandemic to discuss how best to assist businesses in the SMWOBA portfolio during this time. Lending activity nearly came to a halt as businesses closed. Commerce and the fund managers agreed that the terms needed to be modified to help existing businesses in the portfolio to stay afloat. Businesses were offered up to 6 months in payment and interest deferments. As the economy recovers, these businesses will need access to capital with flexible t erms in order to survive. The SMWOBA is a valuable resource to help businesses recover. The fund managers' community outreach activities include promotions through social media, including blog posts and podcasts. They have strong relationships with their local Chambers of Commerce and financial institutions. One fund manager recently hired a minority owned business to design marketing materials for the program paired with broadcast and online media outlets. Referrals are another source of outreach. Fund managers also participate and sponsor workshops and seminars in partnership with local, state, and federal agencies. State of Maryland 65 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Use of Evidence The Maryland Small, Minority and Women-Owned Businesses Account (SMWOBA) has been providing capital for small businesses since 2013. From the inception of the Fund to June 30, 2021, 866 transactions have been approved for $92.3 million, projected to create and retain 10,100 jobs, leveraging $201 million in private sector capital. A total of 772 transactions have settled for $79 million expected to create and retain 8,704 leveraging $192.9 million in private sector capital. With a proven track record for supporting the state's small, minority, women and veteran -owned businesses, Maryland determined investment in this existing program framework would be effective. There is an annual report released each year for the SMWOBA program. There are good faith goals related to the program in general. This program is audited every few years to determine whether the program is effective. As it relates to the COVID -19 response of the program, the program was successful in reaching and assisting small, minority, and women owned businesses. Performance As of June 30, 2021, the Department of Commerce had received requests for funding from 184 small businesses totaling $10,000,000. 91 Loans totaling $6,805,378 45 Grants totaling $1,618,300 48 Converted Loans to Grants totaling $1,576,322 The SMWOBA program and fund managers have an excellent reputation in the small business community. Commerce tracks SMWOBA and fund manager success by conducting an annual survey. Results for the fiscal year 2021: 56.9% indicated a previous lender declined them and 76% stated the loan or investment provided had been helpful for growing their business. 66% are likely to hire new employees in the next year. 94% indicated that they were satisfied with the service they received from the Fund Manager. State of Maryland 66 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 2C.3 - Recovery Now - Department of Commerce - Non-Sales and Use Tax Grants This project supports economic stabilization and growth during and post-pandemic through grants to businesses that demonstrate a need for assistance. The Maryland Economic Development Assistance Authority and Fund (MEDAAF) provided grants of up to $9,000 to businesses that do not collect the sales and use tax. Timeline 3/30 - 5/28/21 Initial application period. Review process started. Commerce conducted outreach to undersubscribed counties and constituents and reopened the application portal. Commerce began sending grant agreements to awardees. Commerce began reviewing grant agreements and processing disbursements. All disbursements completed. Performance The target was to distribute at least 15% to disadvantaged businesses. At the conclusion of the program, we found that 43% of recipients were disadvantaged businesses. Performance data came from client self -reporting on the prescreening questions. Priority was given to businesses that had not received prior funding from MEDAAF.

It provides cash transfers for household assistance to eligible individuals, households, and nonprofit organizations most disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. This includes nonprofit assistance, cash assistance, and fee assistance. Temporary Cash Assistance (TCA), Maryland's Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program, provides cash assistance to families with dependent children when available resources do not fully address the family's needs and while preparing program participants for independence through work. The number of individuals participating in the TANF program increased from approximately 25,000 pre-pandemic to over 57,000 during the pandemic. SLFRF helped the state to support these individuals and families. This project's outcomes: Aid in the recovery of income for Maryland's families. Reduce the prevalence of very low food security Reduce the percent of families with children and youth under age 18 whose income is below the poverty level State of Maryland 69 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 2D.1 - Re Enrolled - Department of Human Services - Temporary Disability Assistance Program Due to pandemic related closures, the Department of Human Services offered waivers of certain requirements (including medical certification of disability) and extended recertification time periods for the Temporary Disability Assistance Program (TDAP) . Following the end of the waiver of verification requirements and a temporary restart of recertifications, the TDAP caseload declined substantially from a peak of 17,649 recipients in June 2020 to 7,491 recipients in December 2020. This decrease was attributed to challenges related to reduced in -person operations and accessing medical professionals to certify disabilities resulting in case closures for documentation issues. Except as the result of a final determination of a Supplemental Security Income claim, under provision of Recovery Now, Maryland retroactively re -enrolled TDAP participants denied payments on or after July 1, 2020 and prevented the removal of participants from the program until July 1, 2021. Those that were re-enrolled began receiving regular TDAP benefits with the $100 per month supplement and received retroactive benefits to the date they were initially denied payment. SLFRF helped to support re- enrollments. 2D.2 - TCA $100 Bonus & TDAP $100 Bonus The state fiscal year 2022 budget, as introduced, in January 2021 provided $37 million to provide for an additional $100 per recipient per month benefit for Temporary Cash Assistance (TCA) participants from January through June 2021. The maximum TCA benefit for a household of three in federal fiscal year 2021 is $702. With the additional $100 per recipient, the same household is receiving up to $1,002 monthly. This monthly supplement of an additional $100 per month was extended to Temporary Disability Assistance Program (TDAP) recipients from February through June 2021. TDAP is the state's cash assistance program for disabled adults which provides a limited monthly benefit for individuals with a short- term disability (at least 3 months but less than 12 months) or long- term disability. If the individual has a long-term disability, they are required to pursue a federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) application. The individual receives a benefit until a final SSI decisi on has been reached. The TDAP benefit in the state fiscal year 2021 was $243. With the additional $100, TDAP recipients received up to $343 monthly. The TDAP benefit increased in October 2021. Maryland supported the TDAP with additional benefits and continued both programs through the end of calendar year 2021 with SLFRF. State of Maryland 70 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 2D.3 - TCA Costs Associated with the Pandemic The Temporary Cash Assistance (TCA) program is Maryland's largest cash assistance program. TCA provides financial assistance to dependent children and family members due to unemployment/underemployment, death, or incapacitation of one or both parents. TCA is primarily funded through the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant. This program's enrollment for March 2020 to February 2021 increased by 49 percent. The chart below shows the increase in active Temporary Cash Assistance cases through June 30, 2021, the end of the state fiscal year. Updated case data will be available through the end of fiscal year 2022 shortly. Maryland invested $140 million in SLFRF for the Temporary Cash Assistance program to support the caseload growth. $50 million was made available to support program costs from March 3, 2021 to June 30, 2021, the end of state fiscal year 2021. The remaining $90 million in funding was available to support the TCA program through state fiscal year 2022. Cash transfers, as noted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, \"mitigate consumption inequality induced by the pandemic and provide incentives to individuals who are most negati vely affected by lockdown policies to adhere to them\" 16. The Center for Budget Priorities found that, \"when children grew up in a household receiving additional cash benefits, their academic achievement increased on a lasting basis.\" 17 This project allows the state to hold an equivalent amount of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funding in reserve to preserve benefits during future economic downturns. 16https://www.atlantafed.org/- /media/documents/research/publications/policy Maryland 71 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 2E - Online Business Assistance Project ID 2E Project Name Online Business Assistance Budget $500,000 Expenditure Category 2.30 - Assistance to Small Businesses: Technical Assistance, Counseling, or Business Planning Financial Summary ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 2E.1 Recovery Now - Department of Commerce - Online Sales Framework Grants $500,000 $500,000 Completed The Maryland Economic Development Assistance Authority and Fund (MEDAAF) in the Department of Commerce provided grants to businesses to assist them in setting up an online sales framework and for offering employees telework opportunities. Intended Outcomes Retain and increase jobs created by small business operations Stabiliz e small business operations and main street economies negatively impacted by reduced foot traffic during the pandemic Prevent closures of small businesses and vacant storefronts in main street communities The Department of Commerce sent out grant agreements to local jurisdictions on March 24, 2021. By May 28, 2021, all had signed and returned their grant agreements. Project Details The Department of Commerce: Ensured local jurisdictions prioritized applicants who have not received prior MEDAAF funding. No more than 10% of grant funds were allowed to pay for administrative costs. Administrative costs must be itemized in the final report submitted to Commerce describing the use of grant funds. Local jurisdictions were provided discretion to target industries / sectors for these grants. The distribution of funds was based on county population. State of Maryland 72 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Performance The counties were asked to update Commerce's online portal with grant recipients by July 31, 2021, to include the following: Name, location, and FEIN of each grantee; Amount of grant received by grantee; Use of grant proceeds; and Demographic information responses of each grantee. Online Sales Framework Grants by County and Zip Code Online Sales Framework Grants by Jurisdiction Supplemental Budget #5 allocated $5,000,000 to small businesses for this project.

State of Maryland 75 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 2F.1 - Utility Assistance to Limited Income Customers (Fund HB606 of 2021) To provide $20,000,000 in debt relief to economically disadvantaged Marylanders, this project expands the electric universal service program. Utility companies were authorized to establish a limited -income mechanism, such as a credit, rate, or rider. Mechanisms can include an electric company, a gas and electric company, or a gas company. Rural electric cooperatives are excluded from pa rticipation. Subject to Public Service Commission (PSC) approval, a municipal electric company may establish a limited -income mechanism. Eligible limited -income customers are defined as those with annual incomes at or below 175% of FLP (200% of FPL for th ose 67 years or older) or who are otherwise designated by the PSC. Participating limited -income customers remain eligible for other state administered assistance programs. Proposals for limited- income mechanisms must include the following: 1) a detailed description of the mechanism; 2) an explanation of how the costs will be allocated across customer classes; 3) a supporting rationale; 4) a process by which the PSC will review the effectiveness of the mechanism once implemented; and 5) any other information the PSC may find useful. Funding is allocated for fiscal years 2021 through 2023. \"Energy burden\" reflects the disproportionate allocation of financial resources among low- income households on energy expenditures. Compared to middle- and upper-income households that spend 5 percent or less of their total household income on energy purchases, low- income households spend 10 percent or more of their income on energy expenses. The burden is even greater among the very poor, who are likely to spend upwards of 20 percent on energy purchases.\"18 Performance Total customers served by limited income mechanism Total reduction in energy expenses for customers using the mechanism 18 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4819257/ State of Maryland 76 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 2F.2 - Emergency Assistance for Late Utility Bills (PC53) Project Description This SLFRF project provided emergency assistance to gas and electric utilities providers to reduce customer arrearages (late bills). The Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) led this project as a one-t ime funding mechanism. Grants across three defined categories were provided with the goal of reducing or eliminating residential customer bill arrearages, with a focus on people in-need. Project Activities Maryland utilities reported that thousands of residential customers fell behind on their bills for electric and gas service during the pandemic. The Maryland General Assembly targeted $83 million to alleviate a portion of the $276 million owed by utility customers, many of whom faced significant hardship from loss of employment or reduced hours and income. Utility arrearages grew 123.5% between October 2019 to October 2020. The PSC issued Order No. 89856 directing the funding distribution and requirements for reporting. Only residential customer accounts with arrearages that accumulated before June 30, 2021 were eligible. Grants were applied to amounts owed by customers in the following order: Category 1 Category 2 Category 3 Customers who received prior energy assistance from the Department of Human Services, Office of Home Energy Programs (OHEP) within the last four years. Customers with special medical needs certificates on file with their utility for a medical condition that requires electricity for maintaining health. Customers with the oldest arrearages (late bills). 100% retired - $56 million 100% retired - $3 million ~10% retired - $24 million Customers did not need to take any action to receive the funding, funds appeared as bill credits from July through September of 2021. The order directed electric and gas utilities to communicate with customers regarding the application of SLFRF to their past -due bills. The utilities were directed to include messaging to inform customers of their options for energy assistance, including Office of Home Energy Programs (OHEP) and utility payment plans. Utilities were also directed to include a letter stating the Maryland Office of People's Counsel and the Maryland Fuel Fund could help customers seeking assistance. State of Maryland 77 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Community Engagement A three-day Public Conference (PC 53) was held to engage stakeholders. A press release on July 8, 2021 announced the PC 53 proceedings, including social media posts and notices issued by the executive secretary. The Commission received recommendations regarding fund allocation from Exelon Utilities; Potomac Edison; the Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative (\"SMECO\"); the Washington Gas Light Company (\"WGL\"); the Maryland Office of People's Counsel (\"OPC\"); the Thurmont Municipal Light Company; the Easton U tilities; Baltimore Gas & Electric, Potomac Electric Power Company, Delmarva Power and Light; the Town of Berlin; the Hagerstown Light Department; the Cancer Support Foundation; private citizens Jeanne Ruddock and Raymond Nevo; the Govans Ecumenical Development Corporation; and Commission Technical Staff. All parties were given time at the virtual hearing to provide comments and recommendations on best practices for how arrearage forgiveness should be distributed. In addition, the statutory parties (Techn ical Staff and OPC) both have mandates to represent broad residential interests and ensure that while any individual may not have sufficient resources to participate in the Commission's process the collective interests are still presented. Following the Public Conference, the Chairman and Commissioners drafted the Order for release on June 15, 2021 and immediate dispersal of the funding. Two subsequent press releases on August 31 st and September 22nd explained the outcomes of the public conference and debt relief dispersal. Timeline Utility data collection took place from April through May 2021, grants were awarded in June 2021, and bill credits were dispersed from July through September 2021. Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners The grants were pro vided to twenty (20) utility providers across all jurisdictions. Additional partners include the Office of Home Energy Programs (OHEP) and the Maryland Office of People's Counsel. Intended Outcomes Debt relief to support economically disadvantaged Marylanders Lower the statewide arrearage balances reported by utility companies Use of Evidence \"Energy burden\" reflects the disproportionate allocation of financial resources among low- income households on energy expenditures. Compared to middle- and upper-income households that spend 5% or less of their total household income on energy purchases, low- income households spend 10% or more of their income on energy expenses. The burden is even greater State of Maryland 78 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report among the very poor, who are likely to spend upwards of 20% on energy purchases.19 These statistics serve as evidence to the legitimacy of the three categories outlined in the order. Performance Overall, the 2021 Maryland Public Service Commission Annual Report describes statewide arrearages have dropped back to approximate pre- pandemic levels for most utilities.

The EHP was funded under the State RELIEF Act, which provided $15 million in additional funding for up to 30 days of emergency housing to respond to the economic crisis caused by the COVID -19 pandemic. Funding was administered t hrough direct allocations to Maryland's 16 Continua of Care (CoCs) and Local Homeless Coalitions for the purpose of preventing, reducing, and ending homelessness within their jurisdictions, and providing emergency assistance to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID -19 crisis on vulnerable households. Specifically, they were used to assist households experiencing homelessness to be connected with emergency shelter, quickly regain stability in permanent housing and to prevent households from becoming home less. The goals of the program include efforts to: Provide shelter as a crisis response for people experiencing homelessness; Reduce the number of individuals/households who become homeless; Shorten the length of time an individual or household is homeless; Reduce the number of individuals/households that return to homelessness; and Provide fixed or short -term rental assistance payments to people at risk of being homeless. The Emergency Ho using Program funding covers three main activities: 1. Hotel/Motel. Hotel/motel covers both vouchers and master leases to secure hotel/motel rooms to de -congregate shelters. Client agreements for hotel/motels should be paid thirty days at a time. 2. Emergency Shelter. Emergency Shelter covers activities that connect people with immediate access to overnight shelter to respond to a crisis. Funding provided for Emergency Shelter can be used both to pay for the operations of the shelter, such as rent and utilities , as well as services provided by the shelter, including case management. 3. Rental Assistance. Rental assistance designed to help people experiencing or at risk of homelessness access and remain in permanent housing. Eligible costs include Security Deposi ts, Current Month's Rent and Future Rent (30 days at a time), but does not include rental arrears, utilities or case management services. Rental Assistance should be targeted to households experiencing or at -risk of homelessness, but not limited to the HUD definitions of homelessness. Equity -Related Activities Maryland DHCD used a funding formula, which included each communities share of rental units as the baseline (rather than total population), and then weighted the funding allocations using the Urban Institute's Eviction Risk Average Percentile Score, which assigns an \"equity percentile\" State of Maryland 83 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report or score to every census tract. The percentile represents that area's prevalence of risk factors for eviction and becoming homeless relative to other areas within the state. For example, tenants in a county with an average equity percentile of 50% have a higher risk of eviction than 50% of other counties in the state. Those tenants are more than twice as likely to experience eviction / homelessness than tenants in a co unty with an average equity percentile of 25%. The data used to create percentiles/scores considers housing instability risk factors, COVID19 impact, and equity factors. In addition to using an equity weighted funding formula, Emergency Housing Program funds are targeted to serve clients experiencing, or at risk of homelessness. Clients were required to meet the following criteria: At or below 50% AMI, and currently behind on rent; OR Currently experiencing homelessness as defined as lacking a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. Individuals who are couch-surfing, doubled up, or at risk of hotel eviction are eligible to receive assistance. Community Engagement Related Activities All funding was distributed through local Continuum of Care or Local Homeless Coalitions, which are the local coordinating bodies for homeless services in each jurisdiction. CoC and LHC Executive Boards include members from local homeless service providers, government representatives and individuals with lived exper ience. Timeline The original contract period for EHP funds was March 1, 2021-June 30, 2022, although several contracts have been extended through June 30, 2023. Communities are under tight expenditure deadlines for several COVID relief funds, and the additional time allows them to target and ensure continuity of services for the most vulnerable community members more effectively. Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners Funding is distributed to the lead agency for the Continuum of Care in each jurisdiction, and sub granted to local service providers.

Use of Evidence All EHP -funded programs are required to use a Housing First approach to providing homeless services. The Results First Clearinghouse indicates Housing First had a positive impact based on the most rigorous evidence: Housing First programs address chronic homelessness by providing rapid access to permanent housing, without a precondition of treatment, along with ongoing support services such as crisis intervention, needs assessment, and case management. A form of permanent supportive housing, the program usually serves individuals who are chronically homeless and have persistent mental illness or problems with substance abuse and addiction. Clients can be placed in apartments throughout a community or a centralized housing location with on- site support for those requiring more intensive services; clients receive housing regardless of substance use. 20 20https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research -and-analysis/data -visualizations/2015/results -first-clearinghouse -database State of Maryland 85 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Performance EHP contracts run through June 2023, and final project data will not be available at the time of this report. All providers receiving EHP funding are required to input client demographic data and outcomes in their local Homeless Management Information System (HMIS). This data is used to monitor program quality for providers, and to evaluate system wide performance for each jurisdictio n's homeless service system. The data collected through the HMIS system will allow us to report on the following: Number of Households Served by service type Number of clients served was disaggregated by age, race, ethnicity and other demographics collected through HMIS. 2F.4 - Recovery Now - Department of Legislative Services through the Administrative Office of the Courts - Maryland Legal Services Corporation Grant The Administrative Office of the Courts provided a grant to Maryland Legal Services Corporation to pay for legal assistance for individuals facing eviction. The health and economic emergencies caused by the COVID -19 pandemic have both exacerbated existing civil legal problems and created new ones. Issues related to eviction have become even more complicated and having an experienced advocate can make a tremendous difference for a low -income Marylander who, if not for civil legal aid, would be forced to navigate the legal system alone. The vital work of legal services organizations ensures all Marylanders - not just those with the ability to pay for legal assistance - get the help they need to stay housed. All MLSC funds are used to serve households at or below 50% of Maryland median income, which includes at least 1.3 million Marylanders. Evictions disproportionately affect women and renters of color. A report by Tim Thomas of the University of California at Berkeley showed that the number of Black women evicted is 3.9 times higher than the number of white men evicted in Baltimore City (https://evictions.study/maryland/report/baltimore.html ). However, legal representation can help address this disparity, as a study by Stout Risius Ross LLC found that attorneys are successful in preventing disruptive displacement of Baltimore renters in 92% of the eviction cases they are involved in (https://bmorerentersunited.org/rtc/stoutreport/ ). State of Maryland 86 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Project Activities MLSC made subgrants to eight (8) civil legal aid organizations to provide eviction prevention legal services for low -income Marylanders. The subgrantees make use of both staffed legal services programs and the engagement of the private bar to provide pro bono and low bono service. Civil legal aid organizations provide a variety of services, including offering self-help resources, assisting with rental assistance applications and proper documentation, negotiating with administrative units and landlords, and providing an attorney for full representation in court. Legal aid attorneys working with current MLSC grantees have helped clients achieve a range of outcomes in their cases, including avoiding eviction, delaying eviction so the tenant has additional time to move, avoiding a loss of a housing subsidy, and enforcing a tenant's rights under a lease and more. Equity Related Activities MLSC's project data to -date reflects the fact that evictions disproportionately impact women and renters of color. Of the 2,580 closed cases from July 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022, 86% were for clients of color and 70% for women. Community Engagement Related Activities MLSC's nonprofit subgrantees have expertise regarding models that work best in each of Maryland 's jurisdictions and tailor their services accordingly. These organizations are well- established and trusted members of their local communities, with the backing and collaboration of a statewide delivery system. They also partner with community -based organizations to provide workshops, staff community events, and provide general information on how to access legal services. MLSC's grants were also awarded with access for specific communities in mind. For example, subgrantee CASA serves immigrants, many of whom have limited English proficiency, and Disability Rights Maryland serves individuals with disabilities. Many sub-grantees collect feedback from clients, but due to the hard- to-reach nature of the population served, it is difficult to maintain contact after cases are closed. Timeline MLSC received $3 million in funding on March 18, 2021, and held the funds for deployment beginning July 1, 2021, which allowed for consideration of eviction moratoria and pending legislation. MLSC made awards of just over $2 million to subgrantees in FY22. Remaining funds will be used to maintain services in FY23. State of Maryland 87 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners MLSC made subgrants to CASA, Community Legal Services of Prince George's County, Disability Rights Maryland, Homeless Persons Representation Project, Maryland Legal Aid, Mid-Shore Pro Bono, Pro Bono Resource Center and Public Justice Center. All organizations perform pre -trial intake where a staff person evaluates the case and helps to match the client with an attorney. Several grantees are also performing day -of services, where clients may not have been connected with a legal services provider prior to their hearing, but have the chance to consult an attorney to receive representation through in-court intake. Equity Related Awareness, Access, and Distribution The main differences in level of access are related to geography. Subgrantees are currently offering day-of-court services in Baltimore City, Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Caroline, Dorchester, Kent and Prince George's counties. Due to space limitations, staffing constraints or other issues, in-court intake is not provided in other counties at this time. Additionally, clients with limited English proficiency and limited internet access face additional barriers in learning about services. Both MLSC grantees and the Maryland Courts have attempted to address these issues through translation services and in -person outreach. Intended Outcomes Stable housing for Maryland families Reduce the number of Marylanders experiencing homelessness Mitigate/reduce the eviction of rental tenants Equity Related Outcomes As evictions disproportionately impact tenants of color, all intended outcomes increase equity. While services are statewide, funding was concentrated in areas with high percentages of low - income tenants, for example in Baltimore City. Some funding was also reserved to target traditionally marginalized communities, including immigrants, people with disabilities, tenants in public housing, and with housing vouchers.

Food banks and community organizations experienced increased demand for their services, resulting in an increased financial burden. Artists, performing arts venues, and related organizations faced limited opportunity to cultivate new donors or revenue streams due to closures and distancing requirements. This project provided grants to certain non-profit organizations to mitigate financial impacts, including: Emergency art grants to artists, art districts, and art organizations. Funding to local governments to provide grants to nonprofits with demonstrated need. Priority was given to organizations that had not already received assistance through Maryland's Nonprofit Recovery Initiative . State of Maryland 90 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Grants to deliver food to nonprofit food assistance partners and through direct distribution to the community and work with a network of community and organizational partners including food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, residential tr eatment centers, and faith-based organizations that serve food- insecure Marylanders. Grants to volunteer fire departments and rescue squads that had lost revenue due to COVID-19 and have not received relief from other sources. 2G.1 - Recovery Now - Depar tment of Commerce - Arts Council The Maryland State Arts Council provided 838 emergency grants to artists, art districts, and art organizations. The grants were distributed with priority for organizations that had not received prior COVID -19 relief funding from the Council or that did not qualify for funding under other Council programs. The grants were distributed as follows: $535,813 awarded to arts organizations who had not received previous MSAC funding, in alignmen t with the legislation for this funding, across 34 grants in 10 counties; $1,974,000 awarded to independent artists across 658 grants in 23 counties; and $2,487,187 awarded to arts organizations, county arts agencies, and arts & entertainment districts acr oss 146 grants in 20 counties.

State of Maryland 91 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Impacts \"The emergency funds that the Maryland State Arts Council offered helped to sustain me as an artist living in the rural mountains of Wes tern Maryland. While many of my other writing friends across the country temporarily abandoned their craft to seek outside employment to meet their financial needs, the State of Maryland stepped up and took care of its artists, like me.

Funds were distributed to local governments in April 2021 and the grants were awarded to nonprofits by September 30, 2021. Allocation of funding based on population. Use of Evidence The Center for Effective Philanthropy published the report, Preserving Through Crisis: The State of Nonprofits, in June 2021. The report stated that most nonprofits leaders reported a decline in State of Maryland 93 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report revenue in 2020 compared to prior years and at the same time \"half of nonprofit leaders say demand for their programs and services increased, and 39 percent say their costs increased.\"21 2G.3 - Recovery Now - Department of Human Services - Food Bank Grants Marylanders experiencing low to very low food security increased during the pandemic state of emergency. The Food Supplement Program caseload increased by 25%. While stimulus payments offered temporary relief to low-income Marylanders, through the end of June 2021, demand for food supplements remained elevated. Fiscal year 2022 data will be available shortly. To further support food security, this SLFRF project provided funds to the Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) and the Maryland Food Bank (MFB) . The CAFB delivers food to nonprofit food assistance partners, or in some cases through direct distribution to the community, in Prince George's and Montgomery Counties. The MFB services all other parts of Maryland. MFB wo rks with a network of community and organizational partners including food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and faith -based organizations that serve food- insecure Marylanders. The Maryland Food Bank supports roughly 350 partners statewide that collectively provide nearly 1,450 distribution points with much-needed food for their local communities. In the first 16 months of the pandemic, the Maryland Food Bank saw an eighty- eight percent (88%) increase in the amount of food distributed. It provided more than 66 million meals, nearly 80 million pounds of food. Combined with rising costs, the Maryland Food Bank experienced a 418% increase in dollars spent. 21 https://cep.org/wp -content/uploads/2021/06/CEP_Persevering- through- Crisis_2021.pdf State of Maryland 94 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Maryland Food Bank Dollars Spent The Department of Human Services (DHS) released allocations to t he Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB, $3,237,776) and the Maryland Food Bank (MFB, $6,762,224). DHS received contracting packages, including the scope of service, from both food banks on March 24, 2021. Those contracts were executed, and funds were disbursed on March 25, 2021. MFB has allocated approximately 1.3 percent and CAFB has allocated 19.4 percent (primarily warehouse costs) for administrative costs. Distribution of food bank funding through 6/30/21 Use of Evidence The United States Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service recognized food insecurity was exacerbated by the pandemic. One example of the n eed to address food insecurity is to ensure children are able to focus and succeed in school. According to the National Education Association, \"the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasize t he importance of good nutrition in children when it comes to performing well in school.\" 22 22 https://www.nea.org/student -success/smart -just-policies/funding- public -schools/nutrition -programs Maryland 95 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 2G.4 - Recovery Now - Maryland Department of Emergency Management - Volunteer Fire Department and Rescue Squad Grants The Maryland Department of Emergency Management (MDEM) provided grants to volunteer fire departments and rescue squads that had lost revenue due to COVID-19 and had not received other relief from sources such as county, federal, or other state aid. Ten work group meetings were held regarding the application process and related matters. Applications were disseminated to each county fire/rescue as sociation on Wednesday March 10, 2021. The application review process commenced March 28, 2021. Through May 1, 2021, 180 fire and emergency medical services (EMS) applications have been received for consideration of funding. Estimated losses reported by the applicants total $11,634,867. Payments to departments coordinated by the Maryland Military Department Finance Office commenced in early to mid -July. Allocation of grants by county and department. 2G.5 - Residential Treatment Centers This Maryland Department of Health project issued grants to support the four (4) in- state Residential Treatment Centers to assist in covering costs due to lower occupancy rates during the pandemic. The funding is used to offset losses experienced or expenditures realized between the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic through the end of the grant period. Residential Treatment Center provider rates are cost settled each year and are subject to an Upper Payment Limit test - meaning the payment rate cannot exceed actual costs. Financial assistance in the form of a higher Medicaid rate does not help the providers. These additional Medicaid dollars would only be collected back from the providers. This is because the Upper Payment Limit Test does not allow the spread of costs to only occupied beds. The state utilized SLFRF so that it would not factor into the Upper Payment test.

Project Activities Baltimore City has developed a comprehensive economic recovery strategy with its ARP funding. The attached graphic illustrates the different strategies and the number of residents to be served with both state and local ARP resources. In summary: Hire Up provides immediate job placement assistance to residents impacted by covid through transitional employment and assists with permanent placement following the subsidized positions. Train Up provides occupational training that leads to an industry- recognized credential to residents impacted by covid. Grads2Careers also provides occupational training that leads to an industry crede ntial but is focused on high school seniors not intending to immediately attend college. Apprenticeship is an obvious tried and true workforce strategy that provides \"earn and learn\" skill development opportunities to residents impacted by employers. We are in close partnership with MD DOL to incentivize employers to either start a new apprenticeship or increase the size of an existing one. Wage subsidy for small, minority- and women- owned businesses provides a financial incentive for businesses impacted by covid to hire or rehire city residents who were impacted by the pandemic. The rideshare transportation pilot, \"Let's Ride to Work,\" provides transportation assistance to residents impacted by covid to get to and from work. Frederick County Workforce Services provides training and employment services to residents of Frederick County who were economically impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Two Bio -health Boot Camp trainings were supported to address both the impacts of public health and the need for talent in that industry. Candidates selected for the Biohealth Bootcamp had to meet the economic impact criteria to fund their training. The application and selection process is a partnership among the local workforce area, Frederick Community College (the training provider), and the City and County Offices of Economic Development. The Lower Shore Workforce Alliances will prioritize training -to-work programs that address the need for upskilling job seekers or new and incumbent employees. These programs seek to provide relief to industries suffering from the labor gap created by the recent COVID-19 State of Maryland 98 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report pandemic and its aftermath. Additionally, all projects aim to improve the career trajectories of their participants while easing the negative impact of the pandemic . Examples include: a. MAC's Caregiver Advantage Workforce Development Program (CAWDP): This program proposes to address the shortage of trained entry- level caregivers in response to the COVID pandemic and rise in staffing shortages among in-home and congr egate care facilities. MAC will provide four six -week training cycles with experiential job shadowing for a minimum of 10 persons per cycle totaling a minimum of 40 individuals annually. Participants would further be supported with job placement and coaching for six months following the completion of the six- week course. b. TidalHealth Nursing Assistant Training Program: This project helps workers acquire medical training without incurring a loss of income traditionally associated with existing programs in the area. The on -the-job training program offers to upskill new and incumbent workers to address both the labor shortages in the healthcare industry and the financial pressures that workers have been experiencing since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. I t will be a 6 -week educational plan in which students are introduced to employment opportunities in healthcare.

The Montgomery County Workforce Development Board Upskill MoCo is designed to provide funding for professional development, occupational, and entrepreneurial skills training for individuals impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The program will support training endeavors for impacted residents who may not qualify or wish to enroll in other (federal & state) programs e.g., Workforce Innovation & Opportunity Act (WIOA). Upskill MoCo will ensure that any unemployed or underemployed resident is able to receive support for occupational & entrepreneurial skills training. Examples of training options include the Bio Bootcamp, IT Bootcamps, and other programs not listed on the state's Eligible Training Provider List. Additionally, Upskill MoCo Worksource Montgomery (WSM) will launch the SkillUp\u00ae Montgomery virtual platform in February 2022. The platform is available to all Montgomery County residents through the Metrix Learning\u00ae platform. SkillUp\u00ae Montgomery offers value to State of Maryland 99 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report both residents and businesses. For Jobseekers, the platform offers FREE and UNLIMITED access to more than 5,000 high-quality online training courses for 180 days (6 months). Key Features include Integrated assessments; 5,000+ Workplace 100+ Certification Training Tracks; FREE digital badges & certificates of completion. For local employers, WSM has made some of the features of the Metrix Learning\u00ae System available. Employers will have cost- free access to assessments, online skill training, and cost-effective programs for 130+ industry- recognized certifications from anywhere with internet access, 24/7. The Workforce Recovery Network (WRN) provides funding to support/expand local community -based organizations that provide employment and training services to individuals negatively impacted by the pandemic. Additionally, the programs may also serve those who are: low-income, have criminal backgrounds, have disabilities, homeless, Veterans, English language learners, youth, or have other barriers to employment. Programs and services targeting individuals in Montgomery County's extreme poverty rate census tracts as well as the communities near the pending Purple Metro Line corridor are also encouraged to apply for WRN funding. As Montgomery County businesses attempt to rebound from the negative effects of the pandemic, to include The Great Resignation, WSM has committed significant ARP resources to support small and minority-owned busine sses. WSM recognizes the fiscal impact for employers who are laboring to fill multiple vacancies, train inexperienced staff, develop employee retention methods and innovative incentive strategies. As a result, GROW was implemented to financially support local and minority -owned businesses striving to achieve pre- pandemic revenue levels. GROW provides grants to cover 50- 75% of a new employee's wages for the first twelve (12) weeks of employment. Among other criteria, applicants are required to engage with Montgomery County's public workforce system via Maryland Workforce Exchange to recruit and hire unemployed and underemployed Montgomery County residents. Applicants are also required to demonstrate their Covid-19 hardship through detailed narrative, estimated revenue loss, and pandemic related lay -offs (or closures). In October 2021, WSM expanded employment and training services for out-of-school youth and young adults. Specifically, our contractor will serve individuals between the ages of 16-24 years old who have been negatively impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition to serving those adversely affected by the public health crisis, the program is designed to reach individuals who are one or more of the following: low-income, homeless, pregnant and/or single parent, disabled, ex-offenders, English learners, public assistance recipients, or basic skills deficient. The Prince George's County Workforce Development Board has taken a data driven approach to proactively impact the economic challenges experien ced by county residents and businesses as a result of COVID -19. Our strategy includes the following projects: State of Maryland 100 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Apprenticeship Innovation Program (AIP) - Program designed to operate as an Apprenticeship Intermediary with the goal of increasing the number of apprenticeships in Prince George's County and the number of Prince George's County residents in apprenticeships. AIP formally launched its partnership with the Maryland Multi-Housing Association (MMHA) to support a training program in the multi-housing industry as service team professionals. Students learn basic carpentry, electrical appliance repairs, plumbing and HVAC skills. The goal is that MMHA will eventually have a registered apprenticeship and this training program will convert into a pre- apprenticeship. Covid-19 Workforce Development Recovery Program - Program designed to engage job seekers and businesses negatively impacted by Covid-19, and help them overcome negative impacts through various programming, including traditional workforce development programming, the Prince George's County Hourly Employee Relief Fund (HERF) and the Rapid Re- Employment Grant initiative. Rapid Re-Employment Grants (RREG) - EPG utilized Prince George's County ARP funds to relaunch its Covid-19 Rapid Re- Employment Grant initia tive. The RREG initiative launched in September and by the close of June 30, 2022 EPG had disbursed 187 grants to 183 businesses, totaling $4,560,310.50, and 576 job placements of unemployed Prince George's County residents. The initiative, a program element of the Covid-19 Workforce Development Recovery Program, operates using a braided funding model of Maryland Department of Labor and Prince George's County ARP funds. The Susquehanna Workforce Network, Inc. (SWN) will provide employment and training servi ces, including apprenticeships, to assist regional residents and businesses who were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and have experienced a loss of economic and employment opportunities. Eligible residents will include unemployed, underemployed, area residents who dropped out of the labor force, youth 16 - 24 and adults who engaged in virtual or hybrid learning, members of low and moderate income households, residents that live in an area of concentrated poverty and essential workers in the following occupations during the period March 2020 to present: staff of nursing homes, hospitals and home care settings, workers at farms, food production facilities, grocery stores, restaurants, janitors and sanitation workers, truck drivers, transit staff, warehouse workers, public health and safety staff, childcare workers, educators and other school staff, social services and other human services staff and other workers impacted by the pandemic. The Western Maryland Consortium is working with partner agencies on the Poverty Alleviation Plan.

These strategic goals are focused on increasing the earning cap acity of Marylanders by developing a system responsive to the needs of Maryland's jobseekers and businesses. As a partner, Maryland's local workforce development boards have collaborated with the Maryland Department of Labor in the development of the benchmarks. Benchmarks of Success is a leadership tool that reflects a shared vision of excellence among the state's workforce system partners - five strategic goals are organized around an overall vision to increase the earning capacity of Marylanders... By maximizing access to employment, By maximizing access to and use of skills and credentialing, By maximizing access to and use of life management skills, By eliminating barriers to employment using supportive services, and By strengthening and enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the workforce system. Baltimore City was disproportionately impacted by COVID and the economic downtown that resulted. Baltimore's unemployment rate jumped to over 12% and disrupted the city's economy. The number of residents filing for unemployment increased by nearly 18,000 between February and March of 2020. These challenges, among others, formed the basis for the city's economic recovery strategy that included targeted initiatives to return residents to work quickly (Hir e Up), skill them up (Train Up, G2C, and Apprenticeship), and increase access to services (Community Job Hubs and mobile career navigators). It is also why our strategy included intentional support such as legal assistance and behavioral health support that are embedded throughout the approach. On the Lower Shore, a ll of the projects serve impacted and disproportionately impacted populations. These include individuals, families, and employers who are impacted by poverty, incarceration, unreliable transporta tion, a lack of access to workforce training, a lack of access to health care, computer illiteracy, and a lack of workforce qualifications. Montgomery County has opted to focus on serving Disconnected Youth, English Learners, Dislocated Workers, Small and Minority -Owned Businesses, Homeless Residents, Ex- Offenders, Immigrants, Low-Income Households, Women, etc. All populations that are part of the disproportionately impacted sectors in the workforce in Maryland and nationally. The Prince George's County Workforce Development Board t argeted individuals who want and are available to work, including unemployed individuals who have sought work within the last twelve months. More specifically, the project is serving the following demographic populations of Princ e George's County Residents who are facing economic challenges as a result of the pandemic: Older Workers, 55+ State of Maryland 102 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Female, Black, Hispanic and Latino workers Returning Citizens Limited English Proficiency Western Maryland is working with partner agencies on the Poverty Alleviation Plan. The pandemic has exacerbated the situation by flooding an already overloaded system with many new programs and people to serve. Working with Circles, USA, which is an anti-poverty initiative with 80 chapters across the U.S and Canada. Community Engagement Related Activities Anne Arundel Workforce Development (AAWDC) has several satellite locations located in low - income areas in Anne Arundel County including Brooklyn Park, Freetown, Fort Meade, and Annapolis to provide services and be more accessible to individuals in their own communities. Many of the individuals in these communities have significant barriers that prevent them from gaining and maintaining employment. Access to childcare and reliable transportation are two of the most identified barriers that individuals disclose. AAWDC utilizes ARP funds to assist these individuals that traditionally work in industries that were impacted by the pandemic. Baltimore City has formed strong partnerships with community organizations t hat serve residents with barriers to services. Nearly $3 million in state ARP funds support eleven community- based organizations that will provide occupational training. These occupational training providers are formally linked to Community Connectors which serve as neighborhood-based on-ramps to work for jobseekers. Our partnership with Community Connectors strengthens the workforce development infrastructure at the neighborhood level and expands systems coordination, outreach, recruitment, and job readine ss training for residents with significant barriers to employment. The city will support additional community organizations through Grads2Careers. Finally, the Community Job Hub program offers to support neighborhood organizations by offering to co- locate workforce services at no charge. Worksource Montgomery (WSM) has engaged in a Measurable Equity initiative with a goal that All Montgomery County Residents will have career pathways that lead to equitable and sustainable economic mobility. This action sta tement, while simple and broad, requires WSM to operate in a data-driven high-impact space as it pertains to strategy formulation and program implementation. WSM believes this approach is necessary to create sustainable change and progress for all Montgomery County Residents\u2014especially those from low-income under-resourced communities. WSM also created the Workforce Recovery Network (WRN). The WRN provides funding to support/expand local community-based organizations that provide employment and training services to individuals negatively impacted by the pandemic. Additionally, the programs may also serve those who are: low-income, have criminal backgrounds, have disabilities, homeless, Veterans, English language learners, youth, or have other barriers to employment. Programs and services targeting individuals in Montgomery County's high poverty rate census tracks as well as the communities near the pending Purple Metro Line corridor are also encouraged to apply for WRN funding. State of Maryland 103 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report WRN funding support s expansion of existing services such as recruitment, assessment, case management, training, placement, subsidized employment, internships, and supportive services. The WRN is designed to be flexible and encourage new ways of offering programs and serving under-resourced individuals in Montgomery County. Funding should fill in gaps brought to light by the pandemic, address issues magnified because of the pandemic, and/or expand innovative ideas piloted during the pandemic. The Prince George's Workforce Development Board is using a data driven strategy to ensure ARP funds are designated for Prince George's County residents most in need as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Workforce Board partnered with National Association of Workforce Boards (NAWB) to c reate an interactive map of the Qualified Census Tracts that represent the households in the county that are most in need. The team uses this information to plan outreach events, community engagement activities and job fairs in these areas so they become a ccessible. Additionally, the EMSI Skills Report revealed that \"only a few career areas with above average earnings employ an above average share of female, Black, Hispanic and Latino Workers. Results show that most in -demand skill clusters have low- earning s, whereas employer demand is variable for skill clusters with higher earnings.\" This valuable labor market information is driving our Business Advisory Councils (BAC's) to focus on aligning our program structure and offerings to be inclusive of these underrepresented populations. Southern Maryland's (SOMD) ARP Program joined forces with several partner agencies (WIOA, Veterans, Re -entry, SCEP, MD Labor) to create an outreach task force team designed to reach the underserved populations. This outreach team has begun to saturate the regional community events each month, connecting with hundreds of our SOMD residents. Our ARP Program information has been shared with all our community partners in the region and goes out to over 13,000 unemployed residents weekly. Funds available through the ARP grant allow Susquehanna Workforce Network to do additional outreach and community engagement to assist impacted and disproportionately impacted individuals recover from the negative economic impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic. Individuals reached through this grant, including individuals of low- and moderate-income households, those with other significant barriers to services, and other harder to reach groups will be able to access workforce and career services to increase their quality of life. The Upper Shore Investment Board (USWIB) has connected with the Black African American Males (BAAM ) in Easton to offer scholarships for applicants as they build out a soft skills program serving this group with significant barriers to employment. USWIB has developed relationships with the local Department of Social Services (DSS) in all five counties to obtain referrals from non -SNAP eligible customers under an MOU on the Upper Shore). Use of Evidence Baltimore City's Train Up provides sector-based occupational training, a model with a substantial research b ase that shows they offer significant benefits to employers, jobseekers, and local economies. They lead to higher earnings, greater likelihood of employment, a greater number of working hours, and greater likelihood of working in a job with benefits. They also reduce disparities affecting Black jobseekers and workers.

The Workforce Development Board released a Regional Skills Analysis and a Sector Strategy Study to effectively support employers who represent in-demand occupations in this post COVID-19 labor market. Although these are not evidenced based strategies, they are labor market informed strategies, which allow us to effectively develop and adjust programming according to real time data.

At this time, the latest report is the 2020 Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Annual Report . For examp l e, the Maryland Apprenticeship and Training Program (MATP) registered 3,814 new apprentices across the state. 1,396 apprentices graduated from training as journey workers in their various disciplines, including electrical, plumbing, HVAC, information technology, and manufacturing. Local Workforce Development Boards (LWDBs) supported registered apprentices using WIOA funds for 7 impacted workers and for 76 apprentices with ARP funds. LWDBs provided the following statistics about use of ARP funds: Employment Following Support from Local Workforce Development Boards Job Placements Adult Dislocated Workers Youth Employment Second Quarter After Exit 925 290 Employment Fourth Quarter After Exit 103 341 Median Earnings $7,811 $10,400 $4,089 Credential Attainment 453 110 344 Measurable Skills Gain 750 338 378 State of Maryland 106 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Skilling Activities LWDBs (13) Number of Individuals Receiving Credential (ARP) Number of Individuals in a Registered Apprenticeship program (ARP) Number of Customers Served (ARP) Anne Arundel 78 0 95 Baltimore City 44 10 240 Carroll County 0 1 100 Frederick County 31 0 31 Lower Shore TBD TBD TBD Montgomery County TBD 30 272* Prince George's County 6 4 12,777 Southern Maryland 40 2 175 Upper Shore 22 0 55 Western Maryland 45 29 127 participants - 37 businesses Total 294 76 13,851 *60 Disconnected Youth; 157 Covid-Impacted Residents; 55 Covid- Impacted Businesses In addition, each LWDB created locally defined performance measures for their grants because each is diverse and faces different challenges.

The Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) distributed funding to sixteen (16) community colleges to support the expansion of existing programs, development of new in-demand workforce development training and educational programs, and the marketing of programs to students and community members who are recently unemployed or want to improve their job skills to reenter the workplace. Project highlights include: Provide direct aid to students enrolled in credit and non- credit workforce development or continuing professional education courses; Fund outreach and marketing to market expanded and new in- demand programs to employers, prospective students, and recently unemployed Marylanders; Fund capacity -building initiatives and enhanced ability to deliver training and licensure programs; Expand existing workforce development tr aining and educational programs that lead to an industry- recognized credential, certification, or licensure; Develop new in -demand workforce development training programs that lead to an industry- recognized credential, certification, or licensure; and Fund indirect costs up to 8%. Community colleges are in a unique position to respond and adapt to the local community's labor needs and equip job seekers with the skills needed to succeed in those positions. The Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) di sseminated applications to all the community colleges in March 2021. Funding of $10 million was obligated in late March 2021. The funding to 16 community colleges was allocated proportional to each college's share of total state aid provided under the fis cal year 2021 Education Article of the Maryland Code, \u00a716- 305 and \u00a716- 512. The Maryland Higher Education Commission provides administrative and technical support to the community colleges.

The pandemic illuminated the importance of broadband to access telemedicine, online education, and government services. The Office of Statewide Broadband (OSB ) was established by Senate Bill (SB66), the Digital Connectivity Act of 2021, and signed into law (CH74) by Governor Larry Hogan in April 2021. State of Maryland 110 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report On August 20, 2021, the governor announced the launch of Connect Maryland , a transformative new initiative to supercharge the State of Maryland's broadband investment with a total new investment of $400 million to fully address the digital divide. \"The State of Maryland has set an ambitious goal of ensuring universal broadband to everyone in every single corner of the state by no later than 2025, and Connect Maryland is the game-changing initiative that is going to get us there,\" said Governor Hogan. \"This is just one more shining example that we aren't just committed to fully recovering from the pandemic, but we are committed to coming back even stronger and better than ever before.\" This SLFRF project provides Broadband Services through five (5) subprojects: University of Maryland Extension - Digital Literacy and Education to Bridge the Digital Divide 2I.1 - Broadband - Digital Navigators 2I.3 - Broadband - Tech Extension Department of Housing and Community Development - Disadvantaged Marylanders Subsidy 2I.2 - Broadband - Gap Networks: June 2022 - December 31, 2023 2I.4 - Broadband - Device Subsidy: August 2022 - March 2023 2I.5 - Broadband - Service Subsidy: April 2022 - December 2023 (or until funds are exhausted) This SLFRF project's intended outcomes are to ensure all Marylanders have access to necessary online services and support to use them. They are needed to improve the lives of Marylanders and their families. Maryland Broadband Advisory Workgroup To ensure that funding is invested in local communities swiftly, Governor Hogan announced the creation of a bipartisan Maryland Broadband Advisory Workgroup, which brings together key stakeholders from across the state. This panel includes representatives from the counties and municipalities, as well as members of the General Assembly, to advise the state on the best ways to utilize this new investment in broadband infrastructure. Construction and Access to Infrastructure: Ensure that all households have physical access to broadband infrastructure for service Equity: Ensure that everyone has the financial resources, equipment, and digital skills needed to get online Inclusion: Ensure that the benefits of the internet and digital technologies are available to everyone Digital Equity programs focus on prioritizing \"covered populations\" / communities who are most in need: State of Maryland 111 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report individuals who live a household with income less than or equal to 200 percent of federal poverty level aging individuals individuals with disabilities individuals with a language barrier English learners Those with low levels of literacy minority populations rural populations NOTE: SLFRF Broadband Capital Projects are located later in this document in Expenditure Group 5. This broadband project, 2I, is for broadband services in Expenditure Group 2 - Reducing Negative Economic Impacts. 2I.1 - Broadband - Digital Navigators and 2I.3 - Broadband - Tech Extension The University of Maryland Extension (UME) administers the Digital Navigators and Tech Extension projects to teach people how to use the internet and digital literacy. On May, 24, 2022 UME announced the following: To help satisfy the demand for future web access, University of Maryland Extension (UME) has received $6M as part of a $300M statewide package to develop and adapt curriculum, train, and support an increase in digital literacy, access, and navigation. There is a new sense of urgency from Maryland legislators to empower connectivity, with UME at the forefront of the effort. The three core components of this statew ide project are broadband infrastructure and deployment and rural broadband and digital connectedness, affordability including funding for broadband service fees and devices, and adoption. UME will focus specifically on the adoption component, with $4M available for training, competency, and education initiatives, and $2M to help people sign up for access and acquire a device. Following a close examination of the Abell Foundation's recent report on digital connectedness, UME faculty discovered that the digital divide in Maryland disproportionately affects residents in Baltimore City and rural counties, low-income residents, and people of color specifically Black, African -American, Latinx, and older individuals. UME will cater their efforts specifically towards those audiences. \"The digital divide disproportionately affects Marylander's learning, work, access to service, civic engagement, and living. We are seeing some of the lowest subscription percentages in urban areas like Baltimore City and rural communities.\" said Jim Hanson, professor and associate dean/director for UME. \"There are also low levels of digital literacy with many individuals not seeing the means for connectivity. Through this generous funding from the state, we will mobilize a tech -education division to provide the training, support, and curriculum development to help increase adoption, understanding, and comfort.\" State of Maryland 112 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report According to UME project leader Jinhee Kim, the project's first phase will emphasize stakeholder surveys and interviews to better understand community needs, with participation from the statewide Office of Broadband, Maryland Rural Council, and als o the university's School of Information Studies because of their unique connection to the library system. In rural communities, library computer stations are major points of web access for residents making partnerships with libraries an essential component of this plan. \"Digital literacy is an important part of our digital inclusion efforts,\" said Kenrick Gordon, Director of Statewide Broadband at the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development. \"Without providing a firm understanding of how to access the internet and what it can be used for, we will fail in our efforts to ensure that all Marylanders have access to, understand and are able to utilize broadband.\" \"The survey and needs assessment phase is critical, otherwise we may miss accessibility or adoption issues that apply to a large group of people,\" explained Kim. \"UME wants to meet community members at their comfort level, allowing them to further their education and information gathering abilities through seamless broadband acc ess. In subsequent phases, UME will use the $4M to develop curricula that are social, cultural, and linguistically appropriate; provide training and support for instructors and trainers, volunteers, peers, family members, and residents; create an online d igital literacy repository; and develop digital literacy partnerships with government agencies, libraries, workforce agencies, nonprofits, businesses, and many others. The $2M will be directed toward improving digital navigation including home connectivi ty, devices, and digital skills; assisting community residents with resources on affordable broadband access and devices; and providing basic technical support, like how to connect to WIFI, to enhance digital access. \"The question isn't how much it'll cos t to bridge the digital divide, the question is how much will it cost if we don't act right now,\" State Senate President Bill Ferguson (D -Baltimore City) said at a press conference to announce the funding. \"Who will be left out of the opportunities of today and tomorrow if we don't have urgency around this issue?\" Program performance measures will include: Targeted zip codes/census tracts for marketing efforts Engagement of those currently working on the issue Expansion of entities working on digital liter acy issues Additional output and outcome measures will be established State of Maryland 113 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 2I.2 - Broadband - Gap Networks, 2I.4 - Broadband - Device Subsidy, and 2I.5 - Broadband - Service Subsidy Gap Networks Grants - These grants fund the construction, expansion, and upgrade of local internet networks that provide a no-cost / very low cost option to its residents. These networks are designed to directly address the affordability challenge that low income households face in subscribing to internet service. The grants help communities to close gaps in service for improved broadband access (available), adoption (subscribed), and utilization (digital literacy).

The office has also met multiple times with local community organizations to better understand their needs and the impacts their programs have on the communities they serve. The digital equity programs have been designed to assist those communities directly. The Gap Networks program encourages partnerships and the following organizations to apply: local government (Counties & Municipalities); or a foundation, corporation, institution, association, or coalition that is\u2014 (i) a not - for-profit IRS approved 501(c) entity and (ii) pro viding services within the State of Maryland; or a community based anchor institution; or other community based organizations As we emerge from the impacts of the pandemic, broadband adoption plays perhaps the most pressing role in internet accessibility. Equity Related Awareness, Access, and Distribution What often stands in the way of connectivity are roadblocks to broadband adoption, be it language barriers, lack of knowledge of available options, lack of a device capable of connection, privacy concerns and more. This is where community partners like internet service State of Maryland 115 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report providers (ISP) play an important role. They know and work directly with their constituents, having earned the trust of the people they serve. The office has partnered with multiple ISPs to bring awareness to Maryland's communities whether through mailings or video advertisements. Our programs are built to provide both an equitable and inclusive awareness to communities and those eligible households. The versatility of our awareness and access ensure that all possible measures of distribution are accounted for. For example, DHCD has worked with ISPs on providing advertisements online and on TV, and has partnered with local community organizations to post flyers in their facilities and multi-dwelling units. Equity Related Outcomes It is vital that all Marylanders experience the long -term benefits of internet capable technology using a sustainable approach across the state and at local levels. This outcome can be achieved by developing a measurable platform such as our \"digital equity scorecard\", enhancing upon the technological capacit ies of our community organizations, and collaborating and forming partnerships with key stakeholders. Use of Evidence Device Subsidy: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, approximately 287,000 Maryland households have neither a tablet nor a desktop/laptop computer. Some 200,000 are households whose annual incomes are below $50,000. The state assumed an approximate device cost of $150 to determine the total allotment ($150 x 200,000 households = $30 million). Service Fee Subsidy: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, in 2019 approximately 500,000 Maryland households qualified for the federal Lifeline program or the National School Lunch Program. The state is aiming to address a sizable portion of these households (at least half) and assumed an approximate service cost of $15 per month to determine the total allotment (250,000 households x $15 service fee x 12 months = $45 million). The combination of all the state's broadband projects will work toward addressing the issue for the full 500,000 households. Performance Office of Statewide Broadband Dashboard Device Subsidy: Recipients (households) and funding by zip code /census tract Recipient demographic info (e.g., race/ethnicity, income level, etc.) Gap Networks: Recipients (providers) and funding by zip code /census tract State of Maryland 116 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Service Fee Subsidy: Number of recipients (households) and funding by zip code /census tract Recipient demographic info ( e.g., race/ethnicity, income level, etc.) Most of the projects have not started or are just getting underway. However, with almost 350,000 households qualifying for federal internet subsidy, our office will utilize this number as a hard target for participation. Maryland currently has 160,000 households participating in the federal program. Our goal is t o have this at 80% by the end of 2023 through awareness campaigns. While the office will not track specific demographics (race, age, sex etc.) we utilize address level data with census track information to better understand end users.

The bill also requires that Rate Schedule C be used for the calendar year 2023. SUI tax rates on Rate Schedule C range from 1.0% to 10.5%. ( Governor's news release ) The law requires Governor Hogan to include in the fiscal year 2022 annual budget bill an appropriation of federal American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds sufficient to replenish the SUI trust fund to the point resulting in Table C for calendar 2022. The appropriation may also be used for administrative costs, including the repayment of the federal unemployment insurance (UI) loan balance. The Hogan Administration previously estimated that $1.1 billion in federal funds would need to be allocated to the UI trust fund to accomplish this goal. (SB 811 fiscal note) State of Maryland 119 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 2021 SUI tax rates increased from lowest rate schedule to highest rate Rate Schedule F, the highest per law, is in effect for calendar year 2021. Due to the enactment of the Relief Act ( SB 496/CH39), Governor Hogan's Executive Order 20 -12-10-01 requiring that the 2021 SUI tax rates not be based on individual employer experience for fiscal year 2020 was codified. Although the computation of employer individual SUI tax rates did not take into account COVID -19 UI benefits for fiscal year 2020, the overall historic impact on the state's UI trust fund caused a significant increase in 2021 employer SUI tax rates. (See EY Tax Alert 2021- 0427, 2-25 -2021.) The Maryland 2021 SUI tax rates range from 2.2% to 13.5% on Table F, up from 0.3% to 7.5% on Table A (the lowest rate schedule). Table A had been in effect for five consecutive years prior to 2021. ( Maryland Department of Labor website .) See the Department's website for frequently asked questions about the executive order and the governor's website for more information on the Relief Act . Employers not charged with COVID -19 UI benefits until state of emergenc y ended on July 1, 2021 Employer accounts have not been charged with regular COVID-19 UI benefits during the COVID-19 state of emergency. Governor Hogan announced that the state of emergency ended as of July 1, 2021. ( Executive Order 21-06-15-01 .) According to the federal Treasury Direct website, as of September 27, 2021, Maryland paid off its federal UI loan balance by using ARP funding as allowed under SB 811. Assuming the state does not borrow again, it has avoided the federal unemployment insurance tax (FUTA) credit reduction that was set to trigger in 2022. In the fall of 2020, the Maryland Chamber of Commerce made the replenishment of Maryland's Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund a priority, as the balance of the fund became more precarious due to the impact of COVID- 19. In addit ion to placing a strain on the payout of benefits to struggling workers who are in need of unemployment benefits, depletion of the trust fund balance would have forced Maryland employers to face significant unemployment insurance tax increases in future years. State of Maryland 120 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 2L - Affordable Housing Project ID 2L Project Name Affordable Housing Budget $10,150,000 Expenditure Category 2.15 - Assistance to Households: Long -term Housing Security: Affordable Housing Financial Summary ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 2L.1 Project HOW $10,150,000 $0 Not Started Project Description Homeownership Works (HOW) is a pilot program focusing significant investment in concentrated residential areas within two economically impacted low -income neighborhoods - one urban and one rural - to : Create new opportunities for affordable homeownership through rehabilitation of historic vacant homes and thru creation of new infill homes on formerly vacant lots Provide existing \"legacy\" homeowners with critical home repairs and significant facade improvements. Lift property values to build wealth for new and existing homeowners. HOW will show the importance of targeted homeownership investment to the creation of wealth for formerly marginalized and pandemic-impacted populations. And, HOW will create new tools at the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) - such as for predevelopment and construction financing to create affordable homeownership - to enable sustained investment in communities whose residents have faced significant economic challenges from the pandemic in addition to historic disinvestment. Project Activities New homeownership opportunities: In the urban community of Johnston Square in Baltimore City, HOW will stabilize and rehabilitate at least 30 vacant homes to become affordable homeownership opportunities. In the rural community of the Pine Street Historic District in the City of Cambridge will build at least 12 new homes as infill on formerly vacant lots to become affordable homeownership opportunities. Rehab and repairs for existing homeowners: In both communities at least 15 existing homeowner households will receive support for critical repairs; and at least 10 will receive support for exterior facade improvements. State of Maryland 121 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Homeownership counseling and legal services: DHCD is coordinating with local nonprofit partners to create a pipeline of well -prepared new homebuyers for the new affordable housing units. In addition, DHCD will continue to fund legal services for existing households that have \"tangled titles\"/ estates to remove barriers to accessing support for critical repairs. Equity Related Activities The HOW pilot is focused entirely on targeted homeownership in two historic African American communities with depressed property values. The overarching goal of HOW is to strengthen these housing markets through blight elimination and concentrated homeownership investment to increase equity and wealth for new homebuyers of color as well as for exis ting homeowners of color. Community Engagement Related Activities The HOW pilot has been informed by substantial consultation with nonprofit leaders, local government leaders, private -sector development leaders and local community leaders. In the Spring of 2021, DHCD staff conducted interviews with ~40 stakeholders before designing the concept for what became the HOW pilot; this research resulted in an internal report entitled \"Housing Acquisition and Rehabilitation: Opportunities for Maryland's Community Revitalization Toolbox.\" Prior to deploying the awarded HOW funding, DHCD's CDA appointed a special project leader to refine the deployment of HOW funding and related funding; the CDA project leader subsequently conducted interviews, meetings, and site vi sits. Timeline January 2022 through June 2022 - Coordination with local partners to create investment plans, roles, and grant agreements. Workshops for existing homeowners interested in assistance with critical repairs and facade improvements. July 2022 through December 2022: Obligation of approximately $5 million in HOW funding for rehabilitation and construction for new homeownership opportunities. Obligation of approximately $1million for critical repairs and facade improvements for existing homeowners. Creation of pipeline of new homebuyers through housing counseling. January 2023 through June 2023: Obligation of remaining $3 million in HOW funding for remaining activities. Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners Johnston Square, Baltimore City: DHCD's principal partner is the nonprofit Rebuild Metro Baltimore which is working in close partnership with the grassroots Rebuild Johnston Square community association. Rebuild Metro will be the recipient of HOW grant awards to support pre-development work including the stabilization of vacant properties for rehabilitation for homeownership, and for residential facade improvements to help bring existing homeowners State of Maryland 122 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report along as the blocks improve. DHCD's special loans team will use HOW funding to support interior improvements for legacy homeowners in the area, and the CDA team will use HOW funding to support construction of the new homes. Pine Street, Cambridge: DHCD has two principal partners - City of Cambridge and Habitat Choptank. The city will focus H OW funding on recruitment of a Developer for new infill construction, and Habitat will focus on both infill and rehab activities using their sweat equity model. Equity Related Awareness, Access, and Distribution Because the HOW pilot is focused on residential investment in two specific historic African American communities, DHCD has provided extensive outreach to residents through a variety of trusted and practical channels. In Cambridge, equitable awareness of th e HOW program has been accomplished through: City council hearings and community meetings. In Johnston Square, equitable awareness of the HOW program has been accomplished through trainings with Johnston Square block captains and community meetings. Intended Outcomes Overarching Outcomes Increased home values to increase wealth of households of color Decreased residential vacancies and increased housing quality as a means of neighborhood revitalization and safety. Outputs to Achieve Outcomes Number of units of rehabilitated housing: At least 30 in Johnston Square/Baltimore City. Number of units of new infill housing: At least 12 in Pine Street/Cambridge. Number of home buyers provided counseling: At least 50. Number of homeowners provided \" tangled title\" services: At least 10 Disbursement of all funds by December 31, 2021 Equity Related Outcomes The entire allocation of HOW pilot funding is targeted to achieve and strengthen affordable homeownership in two traditionally marginalized low -income communities. The outcomes described above are entirely focused on achieving wealth building for households of color in these two communities. One challenge to project success is creating a pipeline of ready homebuyers; previous experience in working with local renters in both target communities portends challenges with sufficient income and credit health. State of Maryland 123 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Use of Evidence Numerous studies have shown that homeownership has been a traditional source of wealth for low and moderate-income households. However, homeownership levels of people of color have lagged the majority population. In addition, people of color have been hist orically segregated by redlining and other systemic factors in neighborhoods with homes of lower value. A 2018 study by the Brookings Institution determined that homes in majority Black neighborhoods are undervalued by $48,000 on average when compared to homes of similar quality in neighborhoods with similar amenities but with very few or no Black residents. Targeted concentrated investment in new homeownership and strengthening existing homeownership is an evidence-based approach to both increasing household wealth and strengthening overall neighborhood home values. Performance Report Overarching Outcomes: Increased home values to increase wealth of households of color Decreased residential vacancies and increased housing quality as a means of neighborhood revitalization and safety. Outputs to Achieve Outcomes: Number of units of rehabilitated housing: At least 30 in Johnston Square/Baltimore City. Number of units of new infill housing: At least 12 in Pine Street/Cambridge. Number of legacy homeowner improvements: At least 30 across both sites Number of residential exterior and facade improvements: At least 30 across both sites Number of home buyers provided counseling: At least 50 . Number of homeowners provided \"tangled title\" services: At least 10 Ame rican Rescue Plan Support Outside of SLFRF Outside of SLFRF, the Homeowner Assistance Fund was established by the American Rescue Plan enacted on March 11, 2021, to help homeowners experiencing financial hardship after January 21, 2020. The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) will receive $248 million through this program over three years to assist homeowners struggling with their mortgage payments or other housing costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Homeowner Assistance Fund Data Dashboard includes performance measures on the count and amount of applications, grants and loans approved, demographic information on applicants, and customer service measures. State of Maryland 124 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Similarly, the state received federal funds to administer the Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP). The ERAP Data Dashboard contains the latest performance metrics.

The first subproject provided funds to enhance the educational services provided to youth placed in Department of Juvenile Services -operated detention and residential facilities. Four of the remaining five projects provide funds to Maryland's 24 local education agencies (LEAs) to address the impact of lost instruction associated with pandemic-related school closures and disrupted learning. Two projects, the Student Support Network and Transitional Supplemental Instruction - Blueprint have not started. The Student Support Network will provide funds to a nonprofit organization in Baltimore County dedicated to supporting low-income students in that jurisdiction. The Transitional State of Maryland 126 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Supplemental Instruction - Blueprint project will operate identically to the existing Transitional Supplemental Instruction project, and begins in fiscal year 2023 (July 1, 2022 - June 30, 2023). Maryland's LEAs received one-time support from SLFRF and other, one-time programs at the same time, all a part of the three tranches of emergency federal legislation intended to address and ameliorate the effects of the pandemic. Expectations for project activities and related spending associated with SLFRF projects are a small portion of the total, one- time COVID relief funds the state and LEAs received. Context matters: given the amount of funding, the timing of the funding, and the timeframe of grant performance periods, report readers should temper expectations on the timing and reporting of actual spending. Maryland received more than $3 billion in Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) and SLFRF funding for Maryland's schools. $3 billion constitutes a substantial, one- time infusion of federal funds into Maryland schools. However, those funds are spread across five school/fiscal years and are intended to serve the state's more than 860,000 children each year. In total, the aggregate amount of funding comes to less than $500 per-pupil for each tranche of federal funding over the course of the term. What does that look like compared to the state share of state aid that Maryland provides each year? In FY 2023, Maryland will provide, on average, $8,027, per-pupil in the state share of state aid to Maryland school districts. Project Activities The Recovery Now - Juvenile Services Project provided students and staff with peripherals, classroom technology, and equipment to effectuate virtual learning in state-operated detention and residential facilities. LEAs established and implemented tuition -free summer school programs for K-12 public school students. Rising kindergarten students are included in these programs. LEAs must provide transportation as needed, establish partnerships with local governments and nonprofit organizations to support student experiences, administer pre and post program assessments, and evaluate the effectiveness of the program at the conclusion of each year. LEAs provide transitional supplemental instruction for public school students in grades K-3. LEAs are to prioritiz e students with the greatest learning loss, including students in special education and English learners. LEAs must prioritize literacy, use evidence-based programs and strategies that meet the expectations of Strong or Moderate evidence as defined in the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, and administer a pre-and post- assessment to evaluate student progress. Transitional supplemental instruction includes one-on-one and small-group tutoring of not more than four students with a certified teacher, a teaching assistant, or other trained professional, cross-age peer tutoring, and screening, identifying, and addressing literacy deficits. LEAs provide tutoring and supplemental instruction for public school students in grades 4 through 12 that is aligned with local curriculum, use evidence-based programs and strategies that meet the expectations of Strong or Moderate evidence as defined in the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, administer a pre-and post- assessment to evaluate student progress, and evaluate the effectiveness of the tutoring program at the end of each school year. State of Maryland 127 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Equity Related Activities The focus is on serving students most impacted by the pandemic. The Juvenile Services project focuses support on students currently in state operated detention and residential facilities. Community Engagement Related Activities County Boards of Education facilitate community engagement through a number of avenues, including regular board meetings, community surveys, and stakeholder engagement activities. Timelin e Subprojects began in 2021 and will continue through the end of the grant period, 12/30/2024. Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners The Juvenile Services program is operated by the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE). MSDE facilitated the pur chase and installation of peripherals, classroom technology and equipment. The subprojects implemented by LEAs require an application and budget narrative for each subproject. MSDE issues grants to LEAs. LEAs report expenditures on a monthly basis and MSDE reimburses the reported expenditures. In implementing the subprojects, some LEAs are partnering with community- based organizations to support summer enrichment activities, and before and after school transitional supplemental instruction and tutoring. LEAs are required to use the grant funds to implement summer programs for all students, and to provide transitional supplemental instruction and tutoring to students with the greatest learning loss resulting from pandemic -related school closures and disrupte d instruction. Intended Outcomes Mitigate the impact of learning loss associated with pandemic -related lost instructional time Improve the literacy skills of public K -3 students Improve the grade -level outcomes for grade 4- 12 students Enable access to credit recovery for high school students Equity Related Outcomes The outcomes for these subprojects are expected to result in academic gains for all students participating in the programs. Use of Evidence LEAs are required to use evidence -based programs and strategies that meet the expectations of Strong or Moderate evidence as defined in the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, administer a pre-and post -assessment to evaluate student progress, and evaluate the effectiveness of the program at the conclusion of each session or school year. State of Maryland 128 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Performance As of June 2022, Maryland LEAs are spending at the pace MSDE would expect given the order of the fund obligation and liquidation deadlines and the length of the grant performance period. For example, the appropriate spending pattern MSDE would expect as of June 2022 would be to see the majority of ESSER I funding reported as spent, some spending of total ESSER II funds, and little spending of ESSER III funds, given the timelines associate d with obligating those grants (ESSER I, September 30, 2022; ESSER II, September 30, 2023; and ESSER II, September 30, 2024). Total and Percent Spend by Grant Program Source: Financing the Future: Covid Relief Funds, Maryland Leads, and Blueprint for State Aid; Dayhoff, Justin, Assistant State Superintendent; Division of Financial Planning, Operations, and Strategy; June 28, 2022 The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) will employ a similar process to evaluate grant performance and the impact of grant -related activities on student outcomes across its various SLFRF projects. The MSDE will do so in order to make the process cohesive for LEAs and to gather data efficiently from LEAs since MSDE will also be collecting and evaluating performance of the closely related Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds. SLFRF and ESSER funds, combined, represent more than $3 billion in one -time funding. This report reflects the consistent application of grant performance evaluations acros s the various SLFRF grant -related activities and projects (1D.6, 2M and 3B.1). The MSDE will evaluate performance related to SLFRF fund utilization in Local Education Agencies both in terms of fiscal compliance and programmatic outcomes. The Department will do so through the following processes: 1. The Department is using a portion of its Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) Funds to jump start expert review teams and allow for site -level monitoring of program implementation ( e.g., Transitional Supplemental Instruction/tutoring program implementation) State of Maryland 129 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 2. The Department will be collecting and reporting program spending as it aligns to program activities with direct ties to outcome data by student subgroup, by LEA. To date, MSDE has released the first portion of federal COVID-spending monitoring via its ARP ESSER Monitoring Tool an d related guidance. 3. In addition to this guidance, MSDE will soon release a SLFRF and ESSER spending alignment tracker that specifically gathers and reports grant program performance in terms of: a. Implementation fidelity to originally submitted plan and/or the grant program's allowable activities b. Planned/budgeted spending by grant activities c. Actual spending by grant activities d. Student outcome date, by subgroup, by LEA, by grant activity ARP ESSER Monitoring Example - the Department's model for ESSER and SLFRF Monitoring In addition to providing support to school systems through the review of Reopening Plans, MSDE is releasing the ARP ESSER Monitoring Tool to support LEAs in reporting on how ARP ESSER funds were expended in their school system. MSDE will provide periodic technical support sessions in July and August. This coll aborative approach will ensure that LEAs are successful in their mandatory use of the ARP ESSER Monitoring Tool, which will be due to MSDE for review on December 23, 2022. After reviewing the submissions, MSDE may request amendments from LEAs and/or establish dates to monitor ARP ESSER funded interventions in action at schools using the Pilot Expert Review Team Initiative.

It includes three (3) subprojects: 2N.1 - ACES Grants - Excelerate MD 2N.2 - Expansion of the Boys and Girls Clubs MD 2N.3 - Health Equity Resource Communities Grants 2N.1 - ACES Grants - Excelerate MD Rural victims are more likely to experience social isolation, privacy concerns, reduced access to transportation, economic hardship, sexual abuse, exposure to other crimes, and lack of communication with service organizations. Lack of affordable housing, l imited child care resources and low paying jobs are a reality for rural domestic violence victims. The Mid -Shore Council on Family Violence's Safe Passages Project will enhance existing case management solutions to impact the needs of people affected by domestic violence. Services designed by the Mid-Shore Council of Family Violence will address the exacerbated physical isolation that victims of domestic violence experience while living in extremely rural areas and during the COVID-19 pandemic. State of Maryland 131 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Commu nity Engagement Related Activities Safe Passages Project will partner with advanced technological businesses to enhance its existing case management solution. Partners will develop flexible person- centered care collaborations workflows for clients to optimize inquiry, conduct pre-intake and intelligent routing processes, update care profiles and up- to-date visibility of clients as they ultimately transition to self - sufficiency. External partners such as law enforcement and legal counsel also will enable personalized improvements and speed up personal care for domestic violence victims and their families, including children. Timeline Phases will include discovery and planning activities for client care pathways; algorithm creation; build out of custom sources and identify attitudinal profiles to name a few of the activities with a multi-level technology business partnership.

Increase the ability of case managers to provide the right services for the clients at the right time. Pilot a technology solution, incorporating human-centered design, machine learning and real-time alerts to provide a learning pathway to increase job skills of clients 2N.2 - Expansion of the Boys and Girls Clubs MD The Boys & Girls Clubs of Metropolitan Baltimore Inc. will help Maryland's youth recover from the devastating impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic. Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have been linked to an increased risk of poor educational, behavioral, economic, and physical health outcomes. Boys and Girls Club aims to address challenges that include the enhancement of positive evidence-based youth development programs that are being operated by the Maryland Alliance of Boys and Girls Clubs, as well as standing up a new technological solution to create an interactive system to bridge the gap between families and service providers. State of Maryland 132 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report The Boys and Girls Clubs provi de evidence -based youth development programs, mentoring and other educational enrichment activities rooted in positive youth development. In addition to providing the time -tested Club model, the Alliance deployed resources, training, and support for youths and their families. The Clubs provide expanded services to communities that lack universal access to effective youth development programs. This will support the well -being of youth and will continue to link in-school and out -of-school time for Maryland's youth by collaborating with 15 communities. Equity Related Activities In addition to the Youth Behavioral Risk Survey (YRBS) data and robust input from stakeholders, the Alliance validates several data sources to support the opening of Clubs in communit ies where \"youth that need us most\" are present. Data sources such as the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) helps the Clubs identify target areas in need of community resources following a natural disaster, such as severe weather, disease outbreaks or chemical exposures. Social factors that fall into four main categories include poverty levels, household capacity, transportation access and the prevalence of minorities for whom English is a second language. Si gnificant pockets of high vulnerability have been identified in targeted Clubs. Community Engagement Related Activities Through the intuitive technology solutions offered in various platforms, there will be an ability to leverage remote learning opportunities, integrate state data sources, and use intelligent interactions to each user that is secure and accessible at the point of need. One of the goals is to expand pop- up community programs that are mobile in nature and resilience focused to offer summer camps for educational enhancement. Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners The Alliance will digitize manual paper -based workflows enabling insight into membership and speeding time to service time to outcome; deploy learning platform with appropriate engagement framework; connect stakeholders through a care team approach of coll aboration; provide individualized learning tools; generate local and state -level dashboards to inform policy; and create an evidence -based framework for program measurement for 15 Maryland's communities with 23 jurisdictions and Baltimore City. Intended Outcomes Support 5,000 youth through the expansion of SMART Moves: Emotional Wellness Engage up t0 15 communities to expand access to Clubs in Maryland Expand Clubs to an additional 20 community outreach locations Conduct summer aps and provide scholarship opportunities for 5,000 youth Host 12 best -practice and trauma- response training for youth development staff members annually State of Maryland 133 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Grow the reach of virtual social -emotional wellness programs to support counties in Maryland. Use of Evidence Under standing the implications of the ACE study and the developments in fields of neuroscience, epigenetics, trauma, and resilience is a powerful pathway to health, well -being, and a more prosperous Maryland. Preventing ACEs and their intergenerational transmis sion is the greatest opportunity of our time to improve the health, education, and economic outcomes of Marylanders. The Clubs provide evidence -informed youth development programs, mentoring and other educational enrichment activities rooted in positive youth development. The Boys & Girls Club model has been shown to develop and enhance the key protective factors among youth. Club programs such as SMART Moves; Passport to Manhood; Torch Club, SMART Leaders focuses on adolescents and aims to change attitudes and risky behaviors. These are rated as a promising program in the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) model program guide. Performance The performance data was self -reported by subrecipients: State of Maryland 134 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 2N.3 - Health Equity Resource Communities Grants This project will provide grants to newly established Health Equity Resources Communities (HERCs) through the Pathways to Health Equity program. The Maryland General Assembly approved the Maryland Health Equity Resources Act during the 2021 legislative session. The bill outlines the designation of HERCs, and includes five (5) policy objectives: 1. Reduce health disparities 2. Improve health outcomes 3. Improve access to primary care 4. Promote primary and secondary prevention services 5. Reduce health care costs, hospital admissions and readmissions. The HERC Advisory Committee is responsible for program implementation, program evaluation and data collection metrics , preparation of an annual report on the program, and development of strategies for tax incentives and loan repayments to assist HERCs in achieving their mission. Resource allocation is determined by the HERC Advisory Committee managed by the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission (CHRC). The CHRC is responsible for establishing a Pathways to Health Equity Program to ensure the long- term viability of the HERC program. Grant funding for Pathways to Health Equity to specified entities is provided through this program and must be for two years. Special consideration must be given to proposals from areas previously designated as Health Enterprise Zones (HEZs). Project Activities, Timeline, and Community Engagement The Governor's Office, the Senate President, and the Speaker of the House made appointments to the HERC Advisory Committee on July 12, 2021. The CHRC held its first meeting of the HERC Advisory Committee on August 11, 2021. Three (3) advisory subcommittees were appointed, including the Consumer Outreach and Community Engagement Subcommittee, Pathways Call for Proposals and Design Subcommittee, and the Data and Program Evaluation Subcommittee. (All HERC Committee and Subcommittee meetings are available to the public, live and online.) Substantive work to prepare and release the Pathways to Health Equity request for proposals (RFP) ensued, Laying the Foundation for the Health Equity Resource Community Initiative. The RFP was release on -time, October 12, 2021 The HERC Consumer Outreach and Community Engagement Subcommittee then hosted 14 meetings across the state in October 2021 to inform communities and potential applicants about the Pathways to Health Equity RFP. Every region in the state had an in-person and online meeting . State of Maryland 135 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Nonprofit community-based organizations, nonprofit hospitals, federally qualified health centers (FQHC), institutions of higher education, and local government agencies may receive the HERC designation if they apply to CHRC on behalf of the area. The application must include community -based organizations to provide health and support services within the HERC and will outline practices for community engagement and outreach. This resulted in forty (40) applications received to the RFP, requesting $41 million ($13.5 million available to award). Applications were due December 7, 2021. On February 15, 2022, the CHRC voted to award 9 grantees under the new \"Pathways to Health Equity\" program, investing $13.5 million in new resources in underserved communities throughout the state . Specific health disparities targeted by the new projects include diabetes, asthma, heart disease and hypertension, mental health, substance use disorder, maternal and child health, and Sickle Cell Disease. On July 5, 2022, the CHRC voted to approve 17 grants totaling $7.2 million to support three types of projects: 1. addressing chronic disease prevention and disease management, including diabetes and its comorbidities, hypertension, heart disease and others 2. promoting behavioral health and the ongoing impact of the opioid crisis 3. promoting maternal and child health services. Intended Outcomes Reduce health disparities Improve outcomes, including reduced cancer, heart disease and infant mortality rates Improve access to primary care Promote primary and secondary prevention services Reduce health care costs Use of Evidence A broad body of research has shown that health disparities exist between Black, Hispanic and Native American individuals and their white counterparts. This can be seen in data comparing rates of heart disease, stroke, infant mortality, maternal mortality, obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cancers, respiratory diseases and autoimmune diseases by race and ethnicity. COVID - 19 infection data also shows racial disparity. For example: While Black individuals comprise 29.8% of the Maryland population, they represented 36% of COVID-19 deaths as of January 18, 2021. Maryland's maternal mortality rate for Black women is 3.7 times that of White women, and the racial disparity has widened in recent years. State of Maryland 136 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Public Sector Capacity Expenditure Group 3 is Public Sector Capacity. This section includes SLFRF projects for Improving Public Health and Reducing Negative Economic Impacts related to Public Sector Capacity. This means how funds were used to support the public sector workforce and capacity, including public sector payroll, rehiring of public sector workers, and building of public sector capacity. State of Maryland 137 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 3A - Public Sector Assistance Project ID 3A Project Name Public Sector Assistance Budget $325,100,000 Expenditure Category 3.1 - Public Sector Workforce: Payroll and Benefits for Public Health, Public Safety, or Human Services Workers Financial Summary ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 3A.1 Health Insurance $75,000,000 $64,196,538 More Than 50% Complete 3A.2 Overtime for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner $100,000 $100,000 Completed 3A.3 Public Safety Salaries $250,000,000 $250,000,000 Completed This project provides financial assistance to the state to support workforce payroll and benefits to Public Health, Public Safety, and Human Services Workers. There are three (3) subprojects: 3A.1 - Health Insurance 3A.2 - Overtime for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner 3A.3 - Salaries at the Depar tment of Public Safety and Correctional Services 3A.1 - Health Insurance The state authorized the increase of funds to cover health insurance claims / shortfalls due to the increased COVID -19 related claims within state employee health insurance. Eligib le employee claims included professional services, inpatient and outpatient hospital charges, lab, radiology, emergency room, testing kits, vaccines and antiviral medications. The s tate offers employees five health insurance plans administered through three carrier partners, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, Kaiser Permanente, and United HealthCare. Health care provides submitted claims to the elected health plan on behalf of plan participants. 199,889 unique participants have had at least one claim paid for a COVID- 19 related service between March 3, 2021, and June 15, 2022, for dates of service through May 31, 2022. State of Maryland 138 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 118,144 unique patients have received vaccines through our prescription drug vendor, CVS Caremark. An additional 6,058 unique patients filled antiviral medication or purchased testing kits. Statistics include those with both a medical claim and prescription claim. Claim data is captured in real time for the period March 3 , 2021, through June 15, 2022. 3A.2 - Overtime for the Office of Chief Medical Examiner This project provides financial assistance to cover a portion of overtime for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME). OCME caseload increased in FY 2021 by 10.9% over the previous fiscal year to 18,600 cases, and 22.3% over the past two fiscal years. COVID- 19 cases were a factor in this increase, on top of a longer-term increase in opioid deaths. OCME is required to investigate deaths that are sudden and unexpected, result from injury, occur under unexplained or suspicious circumstances, or when a person is not attended by a physician. The number of eligible OCME employees who are entitled to receive cash for overtime worked has increased to meet this additional demand. 3A.3 - Public Safety Salaries The Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS) utilized SLFRF t o fund salary expenses for 4,957 correctional officers (public safety) from July 1, 2021 - June 30, 2022. Recruiting and retaining the state's public safety workers at Maryland's 19 correctional institutions is mission critical, and a priority for the Hogan Administration. Recipients of this funding were required to work within the confines of a correctional facility and were directly responsible for the custody of inmates. By nature of their work, the recipients of the funding were frequently in close contact with inmates who have tested positive and were quarantined, as well as in close contact with other correctional staff while having no ability to maintain social distancing within correctional facilities that have poor ventilation. On July 2, 2021, Governor Larry Hogan announced $13 million in salary increases for employees who are charged with the care and custody of inmates within Maryland's correctional facilities . This follows the administration's announcement last week of increased salaries for new hires into these critical positions. These salary enhancements are designed to enhance the state's ability to compete in an area that has seen recruitment challenges despite many innovative efforts to hire correctional officers . \"This is vital work and the individuals who maintain the security of our correctional institutions and oversee the work of inmates deserve recognition for performing this challenging job,\" said Governor Hogan. \"I am pleased to be able to offer these increases, which are well- deserved.\" The state was able to reach agreement with the exclusive representative of these employees, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees within a very short period. State of Maryland 139 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 3B - K- 12 Emotional and Behavioral Services Project ID 3B Project Name K-12 Emotional and Behavioral Services Budget $25,000,000 Expenditure Category 3.4 - Public Sector Capacity: Effective Service Delivery Financial Summary ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 3B.1 Behavioral Health and Trauma Services $25,000,000 $6,803,055 Less Than 50% Complete Project Description The Blueprint is a landmark piece of legislation that was passed to provide comprehensive changes to Maryland's early childhood and public schools. Increasing education funding by $3.8 billion each year over the next 10 years, the Blueprint will enrich student experiences, accelerate student outcomes and improve the overall quality of education in Maryland. House Bill 1300 passed in 2020. This bill needed updating to extend timelines and include new provisions to address COVID -related issues. Bill 1372 was passed to update and complement the core legislation, House Bill 1300, and enacted under Article II, \u00a7 17(b) of the Maryland Constitution on April 9, 2021. \"Each county board of education, including Baltimore City, shall use state and federal funds provided for COVID-19 relief in the state budget for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 to address trauma and behavioral health issues exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic on students and their families to identify and provide necessary supports and services for students.\" On or before September 1, 2021, each county board of education, including Baltimore City was required to submit a plan to address trauma and behavioral health issues through summer school programs. On or before January 1, 2022, they were required to publish a report on how the county board spent the funds as described in their plans, including how they: 1. provided behavioral health services to students; 2. ensured that services provided to students address the trauma and behavioral health issues due to the effects of exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic; and State of Maryland 140 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 3. monitored students experiencing more trauma and behavioral health issues than other students; and 4. measured the effectiveness and impact of behavioral health services provided to students using key metrics and procedures. The Maryland Department of Legislative Services (DLS) Library contains the plans and performance reports. From the DLS Library, keyword search 'HB 1372' https://mlsd.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/catalogs/search/results?qu=HB+1372&te=ILS&st=PD Maryland's 24 Local E ducation Agencies (LEAs) received grants. Grant funds are available to the LEAs until 12/30/2024. To the extent practicable, LEAs are encouraged to utilize school -based health centers to coordinate and deliver services to students. LEAs may use grant funds to train teachers and school staff to recognize signs of student trauma or behavioral health concerns. LEAs used the funds to support social-emotional learning programming and materials, counseling services for students, staff and families, establishing or enhancing restorative practices programs, additional school-based guidance counselors, behavioral therapists, and school-based social workers. LEAs report expenditures on a monthly basis which are reimbursed by the state. Community Engagement Related A ctivities County Boards of Education facilitate community engagement through a number of avenues, including regular Board meetings, community surveys, and stakeholder engagement activities. Equity Related Activities Funds were distributed based on each LEA's proportionate share of the State's Foundation Program under the Major State Education Aid funding. State aid in Maryland is wealth- equalized meaning that less wealthy jurisdictions receive a larger share of state aid than more wealthy jurisdictions. By nature of the calculation, more funds under this program are distributed to low-income jurisdictions. Prioritizing equity, the Blueprint prescribes new programs and innovative approaches to catalyze a world -renowned education system that aims to eradicate achievement gaps and ensures opportunity for every student, regardless of family income, race, ethnicity, and/or ability. Delivering opportunity and promise of a better future to every Maryland child, the Blueprint for Maryland's Future will transform the state's education and early childhood systems with sweeping policy changes and an unprecedented investment of state and local resources. State of Maryland 141 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Performance As described in SLFRF project 2M - K- 12 Academic Services, Maryland LEAs are spending at the pace MSDE would expect given the order of the fund obligation and liquidation deadlines and the length of the grant performance period. For example, the appropriate spending pattern MSDE would expect as of June 2022 would be to see the majority of ESSER I funding reported as spent, some spending of total ESSER II funds, and little spending of ESSER III funds, given the timelines associated with obligating those grants (ESSER I, September 30, 2022; ESSER II, September 30, 2023; and ESSER II, September 30, 2024). The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) will employ a similar process to evaluate grant performance and the impact of grant- related activities on student outcomes across the various SLFRF projects. The MSDE will do so in order to make the process cohesive for LEAs and to gather data efficiently from LEAs since MSDE will also be collecting and evaluating performance of the closely related Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds. SLFRF and ESSER funds, combined, represent more than $3 billion in one- time funding. This report reflects the consistent application of grant performance evaluations across the various SLFRF grant-related activities and projects (1D.6, 2M and 3B.1). The MSDE will evaluate performance related to SLFRF f und utilization in Local Education Agencies both in terms of fiscal compliance and programmatic outcomes. The Department will do so through the following processes: 1. The Department is using a portion of its Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief ( ESSER) Funds to jump start expert review teams and allow for site- level monitoring of program implementation 2. The Department will be collecting and reporting program spending as it aligns to program activities with direct ties to outcome data by student su bgroup, by LEA. To date, MSDE has released the first portion of federal COVID-spending monitoring via its ARP ESSER Monitoring Tool an d related guidance. 3. In addition to this guidance, MSDE will soon release a SLFRF and ESSER spending alignment tracker that gathers and reports grant program performance in terms of: a. Implementation fidelity to originally submitted plan and/or the grant program's allowable activities b. Planned /budgeted spending by grant activities c. Actual spending by grant activities d. Student outcome date, by subgroup, by LEA, by grant activity ARP ESSER Monitoring Example - the Department's model for ESSER and SLFRF Monitoring MSDE is releasing the ARP ESSER Mon itoring Tool to support LEAs in reporting on how ARP ESSER funds were expended in their school system. MSDE will provide periodic technical support sessions in July and August. This collaborative approach will ensure that LEAs are successful in their manda tory use of the ARP ESSER Monitoring Tool, which will be due to MSDE for review on December 23, 2022. After reviewing the submissions, MSDE may request amendments from LEAs and/or establish dates to monitor ARP ESSER funded interventions in action at schoo ls using the Pilot Expert Review Team Initiative. State of Maryland 142 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Premium Pay Expenditure Group 4 is for SLFRF projects related to Premium Pay. This includes how funds are being used to support sectors or occupations in any premium pay program. State of Maryland 143 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 4A - State Employee Pre mium Pay Project ID 4A Project Name State Employee Premium Pay Budget $114,393,757 Expenditure Category 4.1 - Public Sector Employees Financial Summary ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 4A.1 Extension of Response Pay for State Employees $61,829,296 $61,829,296 Completed 4A.2 Response/Quarantine Pay $52,564,461 $52,560,458 Completed Project Description The state authorized COVID -19 Response and Quarantine Pay to certain groups of employees because they were performing essential services during the public health emergency with limited ability to physically distance per CDC guidelines. Eligible employees included employees working in 24/7 operations within the Maryland Department of Health, Department of Juvenile Services (DJS), and Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS). Plus, all sworn police officers and state firefighters, and certain employees within the Department of Human Services (DHS) and DPSCS that were required to intermittently perform field work. Employees that fell outside of these categories, but were still required to report to work under certain conditions were approved on a case -by-case basis. Consistent with SLFRF, providing premium pay to eligible workers responds to such workers by helping address the disparity between the critical services and risks taken by essential workers and the relatively low compensation t hey tend to receive in exchange. 4A.1 - Extension of Response Pay for State Employees Eligible employees received $3.13 per hour additional pay for each hour an employee was required to report to work and was unable to maintain adequate physical distance per CDC guidelines. Response pay was available to employees from July 1, 2020 - June 30, 2021 in fiscal year 2021, with the exception of September 9, 2020 - April 6, 2021 (15 regular pay periods), when Response Pay was temporarily discontinued. Maryland provided retroactive payments to eligible employees for work hours for the period of September 9, 2020 to April 6, 2021 that would have been eligible had the pay been available at the time. State of Maryland 144 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report The retroactive payments for the period September 9, 2020 to April 6, 2021 were based on a methodology, discussed and agreed to by the state's largest em ployee bargaining unit representative, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME ). 4A.2 - Quarantine Pay Eligible employees received $5.13 per hour additional pay for each hour an employee was required to work in designat ed COVID -19 quarantine areas. Quarantine pay was available to employees for the entirety of state fiscal year 2021, July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Employees received the response or quarantine payments directly in their paychecks. Retroactive payments for response pay were issued and included in employee paychecks primarily on May 26, 2021 for state regular employees. Eligible contractual employees primarily received retroactive payments on June 2, 2021. Performance Measures Number of employees compensat ed: 13,615 Job classification codes compensated: 491 Average compensation per job classification: $69,266 was the state's average salary in 2021 (source: Maryland State Archives). The response pay threshold of 150% above the state's average salary is therefore calculated at $173,125. Less than one -half of one percent (53 of 13,175) of state regular workers in the State Personnel Management System (SPMS) on response pay earned above $173,125. All 53 earned above this level prior to response pay. Response pay did not push any state regular employees over the 150% threshold. Contractual employees were excluded from analysis due to employees primarily receiving hourly pay rates and varying contract periods of performance.

However, thousands of Marylanders still lack sufficient access to broadband service, mostly because they live in rural communities which are the most difficult and expensive to serve. The Last Mile Infrastructure projects provide financial assistance to construct broadband infr astructure necessary to provide service at the Broadband Grant Speed in areas where broadband service does not currently exist for residents, businesses, and anchor institutions. In 2017, Governor Larry Hogan established the Office of Rural Broadband by Executive Order. In 2018, a director was appointed to the office and a $100 million cost for service to underserved rural households was identified. $50 million was requested over a five -year period to assist with broadband expansion. $11.8 million in capital and operations funding in fiscal year 2020, and $11.2 million in fiscal year 2021, was increased to $32.7 million. State of Maryland 147 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report The following chart compares the percentage of households with a broadband internet subscription on the 2015-2019 5- year American Comm unity Survey to the 2016-2020 survey. In April 2021, the Office of Statewide Broadband (OSB) was established by Senate Bill (SB66), the Digital Connectivity Act of 2021, and signed into law (CH74) by Governor Hogan. On August 20, 2021, Governor Hogan announced the launch of Connect Maryland , a transformative new initiative to supercharge the State of Maryland's broadband investment with a total new investment of $400 million to fully address the digital divide. \"The State of Maryland has set an ambitious goal of ensuring universal broadband to everyone in every single co rner of the state by no later than 2025, and Connect Maryland is the game- changing initiative that is going to get us there,\" said Governor Hogan. \"This is just one more shining example that we aren't just committed to fully recovering from the pandemic, but we are committed to coming back even stronger and better than ever before.\" In addition to SLFRF, the state has been awarded $162,600,000 in Coronavirus Capital Projects Funds . The funds are accounted for in the FY 2023 - 2027 Capital Improvement Program as part of the Local Government Infrastructure Fund. Capital funds will be used to construct infrastructure required to expand high-speed internet where other sources of funding are limited. Connect Maryland capital project funds will work in concert with SLFRF. For these SLFRF projects, local jurisdictions will act as applicants and will have a strong internet service provid er (ISP) with whom the jurisdiction will partner in implementing the project. The ISP will have the means and desire to provide service to the applicant's unserved households and businesses. The jurisdiction and/or ISP will be responsible for the overall i mplementation of the projects and will be the owner of any facilities constructed as part of the project. State of Maryland 148 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report All funded projects will provide a minimum internet connectivity of 100 Mbps down and 100 Mbps up with a maximum latency of 50 milliseconds. The network must be capable of providing the minimum connectivity to all subscribers within the proposed Project area. The reason for the grant speed ensures reliability of connection to households who have been suffering from unreliable speeds. Project Activities Activities may consist of the following: The construction of facilities used to deploy service at the Broadband Grant Speed to all end users located within the project funded service area Middle mile infrastructure directly necessary to provide service to an end user Purchase and installation of equipment and electronics necessary to deliver service to an end user Tower construction and/or tower structural improvements is an eligible cost Equity Related Activities Grants will be awarded on a competitive basis for entities to serve all unserved premises in eligible areas at the Broadband Grant Speed. Equitable scoring criteria have been built into the review of each application. Those projects that have equity plans and address affordability ar e awarded points to rate them higher than those who do not offer equity plans. The office requires all projects to provide demographics of the project funded areas. These demographics we can utilize to identify project areas that provide service to underserved, low-income, and minority communities. Community Engagement Related Activities Any project plan must include the coordinated involvement of multiple stakeholders and partnerships that will benefit all participants. The Office of Statewide Broadband has met with elected leaders (creation of a task force) to facilitate discussions and gauge their feedback on broadband service offerings and future needs. The office has also met mul tiple times with local community organizations and ISPs to better understand their needs and the impacts their programs have on the communities they serve. Timeline Network Infrastructure - August 2022 - August 31, 2024. Rural Broadband (Neighborhood Connect) - August 2022 - December 31, 2023. State of Maryland 149 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners Network Infrastructure: The Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) will provide grants to internet service providers. Legislative Initiative: DHCD will provide grants to local jurisdictions, who will serve as the fiscal agents in partnership with internet service providers. Equity Related Awareness, Access, and Distribution All Department of Housing and Community Development programs provide equitable a nd inclusive awareness to communities and eligible households. The versatility of our awareness and access ensure that all possible measures of distribution are accounted for. DHCD have worked with ISPs on providing advertisements online and on TV, partner ed with local community organizations to post flyers in their facilities and multi- dwelling units. There are no administrative requirements that would result in the inability to complete applications. However, we ensure that the projects we are funding will be carried out by good stewards. Some of these requirements are: Recognized federal 501(c), Federal EIN, Registered Duns & SAM.gov number, and Good standing certificates within Maryland. Intended Outcomes Maryland ranks highly compared to othe r states in broadband availability and adoption. The state's broadband infrastructure, however, remains a work in progress and there is no one solution that best meets the needs of every community. Effective solutions will vary with the geographic, demogra phic, political, economic, and technological topology of areas and communities. In Maryland, broadband service needs are being met through a mix of private sector, public sector and cooperative owned networks with varying levels of coverage. As such the outcomes of our projects vary but are weighted within the same goal, ensuring every Maryland resident has access to reliable internet service. Equity Related Outcomes Our outcomes and goals vary greatly as the office would like to see the greatest impact for our projects to close the digital divide. The divide is between those geographic areas that have access equal to or greater than the latest FCC broadband standard and those areas that have access to speeds under the standards. It is important to note that the divide also exists between households who have the digital skills, literacy and perceived need to adopt and utilize broadband technologies and those who do not. Rural areas are particularly affected by both aspects of the digital divide. The office expects to utilize the demographic data provided within the applications to better understand and address the digital equity concerns in unserved areas of Maryland. State of Maryland 150 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Use of Evidence The FCC's most recent broadband deployment report finds that 2.6% of Maryland households (approximately 58,000) lack network availability at the 25 megabits per second (Mbps) download threshold that defines \"broadband.\" Further, a 2017 FCC analysis estimated a $2,200 cost per structure for \"fiber to the premises\" depl oyment to 90% of unserved places (the final 10% can be extremely expensive because the remoteness and topography of those places escalate costs). These estimates were used to determine funding (58,000 households x $2,200 = $127.6 million). The office has administered, reviewed and evaluated infrastructure related funding and Broadband infrastructure projects since 2019. This project will be the 4 th year of the Office's establishment of Broadband Projects. Based on the impact, testimonials, and data received from these past projects we believe the need for the above referenced projects to be designed relevant to the needs of Maryland's Broadband gaps. Similar projects that preceded these: 2019 Infrastructure Pilot Projects (10) 2020 Network Infrastructure Projects (4) 2020 Infrastructure Pilot Projects (20) 2021 Network Infrastructure Projects (11) 2021 Broadband Expansion Projects (42) Projects are awarded on a competitive basis for entities to serve all unserved premises in eligible areas at the Broadband Gr ant Speed. The program will provide grants of between 70% and 90% of the capital construction costs for major broadband infrastructure projects depending on its composition. Projects applied for are expected to serve significant areas of unserved households and businesses. Labor Practices Project awardees may not discriminate against and hereby certifies that it prohibits discrimination against and will not discriminate against any person on the basis of race, color, religion, ancestry, creed or national origin, sex, marital status, physical or mental handicap, sexual orientation, or age in any aspect of its operations. Awardees shall comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding discrimination and equal opportunity in employment. In addit ion, all awardees, contractors, and subcontractors working on the infrastructure must abide by both the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law as well as the Maryland Wage and Hour Law. The Maryland Wage and Hour Law is similar to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA ) but contains some important differences. State of Maryland 151 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Performance The following performance measures will be used to monitor progress toward outcomes: Network Infrastructure Recipients (households) and funding by zip code /census tract Recipient demographic info ( e.g., race/ethnicity, income level, etc.) Number of households that have service available Number of households that subscribe to service Legislative Initiative Recipients (households) and funding by zip code /census tract Recipient demographic info ( e.g., race/ethnicity, income level, etc.) Number of households subscribing to service Project Management Measures On-Schedule: A construction build- out sc hedule with project milestones, showing the time frames for accomplishing the project objectives and activities on a quarterly basis. This schedule should list all the major network build -out phases and milestones to demonstrate that the network deployment will be completed, and the grant purposes will be fulfilled within the designated grant period as well as assumptions regarding equipment supply chain. The timeframe for completion is spread quarterly over the course of 3 years. On-Budget: A detailed budget of all expenditures related to eligible grant purposes. The budget should include a descriptive name for each capitalized item or group of items in each category whether grant eligible or not. Any ineligible costs necessary for the project, such as bui lding renovations, or similar, must be listed with the costs in the other sources of funding column. As the quarterly reports are provided and compared to the quarterly reimbursement amounts the office will ensure that the budget remains on track not to exceed the award amount. On-Quality: Quality of the project itself will be identified as homes passed and homes served. This information is collected within the system design and includes: The types of services (voice, video and/or data) offered and the num ber of subscribers taking each type of service; The types of technologies used in the network; The total number of end users served. Within the quarterly reports the awardees will provide actual numbers of subscribers being the homes served in comparison t o the proposed take rate.

The Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) funded three broadband projects across the state: ThinkBig Network in Harford County, Bay Country Communications in Dorchester County, and Maryland Broadband Cooperative in Wicomico County. Projects were selected based on location and the ability to be completed by June 30, 2021. Types of projects pursued serve a proposed funded service area where broadband service does not currently exist. All funded projects will provide a minimum internet connectivity of 25 Mbps down and 3 Mbps up with a maximum latency of 50 milliseconds. The network must be capable of providing the minimum connectivity to all subscribers within the proposed Project area. The reason for the grant speed ensures reliability of connection to households who have been suffering from unreliable speeds.

The office has also met multiple times with local community organizations and ISPs to better understand their needs and the impacts their programs have on the communities they serve. Equity Related Awareness, Access, and Distribution Our programs are built to provide both an equitable and inclusive awareness to communities and those eligible households. The versatility of our awareness and access ensure that all possible measures of distribution are accounted for. DHCD has worked with ISPs on providing advertisements online and on TV and has partnered with local community organizat ions to post flyers facilities and multi- family dwelling units. Intended Outcomes Effective solutions will vary with the geographic, demographic, political, economic, and technological topology of areas and communities. In Maryland, broadband service needs are being met through a mix of private sector, public sector and cooperative owned networks with varying levels of coverage. As such the outcomes of our projects vary but are weighted within the same goal, ensuring every Maryland resident has access to re liable internet service. Equity Related Outcomes Our outcomes and goals vary greatly as the office would like to see the greatest impact for our projects to close the digital divide. The divide is between those geographic areas that have access equal to or greater than the latest FCC broadband standard and those areas that have access to speeds under the standards. It is important to note that the divide also exists between households who have the digital skills, literacy and perceived need to adopt and ut ilize broadband technologies and those who do not. Rural areas are particularly affected by both aspects of the digital divide. The office expects to utilize the demographic data provided within the applications to better understand and address the digital equity concerns in unserved areas of Maryland. State of Maryland 154 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Use of Evidence The office has administered, reviewed and evaluated infrastructure related funding and Broadband infrastructure projects since 2019. This project will be the 3 rd year of the Office's establishment of Broadband Projects. Based on the impact, testimonials, and data received from these past projects we believe the need for the above referenced projects to be designed relevant to the needs of Maryland's Broadband gaps.

There are eleven (11) subprojects: 6A.1 - Charlotte Hall Veterans Home This project supports the Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs assisted living and skilled nursing care facility - Charlotte Hall Veterans Home . Charlotte Hall Veterans Home has been proudly \"Serving Those Who Served\" since 1985, and offers a continuum of care from its 126-bed assisted living program to its 318-bed skilled nursing program. The home is Medicare/Medicaid certified, and all veterans receive a per diem subsidy from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Its mission is to continually deliver a safe, dignified, and compassionate health care system, and to provide a nurturing and engaging home environment for Maryland's veterans. In 2016, the state established the Charlotte Hall Veterans Home Fund as a special, nonlapsing fund to maintain the operation of the facility. Its intent was to improve fiscal stewar ds hip by reducing the state's exposure to financial volatility / risk. Under the contract with the facility's management, all federal funds provided to the state, for example the per diem subsidy from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, are remitted t o the contractor. In exchange, the contractor makes bed lease payments that are paid regardless of whether all beds are filled. The bed lease payments are then used to pay for costs. When the pandemic hit, and nursing facilities were described as high risk COVID hot spots, the count of filled beds at Charlotte Hall shrank by 25%. As a result, federal subsidies were decreased. They have not returned to pre-pandemic levels of occupancy. SLFRF provides valuable relief to balance revenue attrition with the need for quality care / services, medical staffing, and maintenance. The prioritized use of SLFRF supports staffing based on projections to bring the resident count back to pre-pandemic levels. The tight labor market and perceptions of COVID in nursing facilities has slowed this progress. To that end, SLFRF supported Charlotte Hall with the needed $2,575,000 in Fiscal Year 2021 - 2022, and $3,945,000 next year. The Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs (MDVA) is scheduled to provide an updated report on progress to the Maryland Department of Legislative Services on October 1, 2022. The report is expected to contain an update on performance including the resident population's needs, staffing, oversight, and projections for returning to pre- pandemic levels. State of Maryland 158 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Maryland Department of Transportation SLFRF Projects 6A.2 - Help out the Transportation Trust Fund (TTF) - Maryland Department of Transportation - Maryland Transit Administration 6A.3 - Maryland Department of Transportation - Maryland Transit Administra tion - Farebox Revenue Replacement 6A.6 - Recovery Now - Maryland Department of Transportation - Transit Operations The Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) is responsible for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the Baltimore metropolitan area transit system and commuter services in suburban areas of the state. Transit modes include bus (local and commuter), mobility paratransit, the Baltimore Metro, light rail, and commuter rail, known as Maryland Area Regional Commuter (MARC) rail. Pandemic related closures significantly impacted MDOT MTA's operations and budget. The commuter bus and MARC train services experienced the steepest reduction in ridership, with declines of more than 90% as compared to ridership before the pandemic. A decline in ridership directly translates to a decline in revenues. MDOT MTA's operating revenues in FY 2022 were 54% lower (-$91 million) than the pre-pandemic forecast published in January 2020. In addition to operating revenues, MDOT MTA's budget relies heavily on support from other transportation taxes and fees, which were also negatively impacted by COVID-19, including motor fuel tax revenue, which was 11% lower (-$140 million) in FY 2022 than had been forecasted p re-COVID. The SLFRF provided relief from lower revenue, particularly in bus operations. Project Activities Despite the significant decrease in transit ridership, and thus transit revenues, during the COVID-19 pandemic, transit remains a critical service connecting essential workers and others to employment, housing, healthcare, schools, and shopping. Support from the SLFRF allowed MDOT MTA to continue to provide service despite decreased ridership, decreased revenues, and increased costs for janitorial services, personal protective equipment, employee incentives, and other needs related to the pandemic response. Fare Increases for Riders Were Postponed: MDOT MTA is legislatively mandated to increase transit fares for core service every two years under the Maryland Transportation Infrastructure Investment Act of 2013. Fares for core service were last changed i n 2019. The 2013 law mandates that fares increase a minimum of 10 cents or higher every two years based on the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI- U) calculation. As a result, fares were set to increase from $1.90 to $2.00 - for Local Bus, Light Rail and Metro Subway. Mobility single-trip fares were set to increase from $2.10 to $2.20. The new fares were set to be effective on June 27, 2021. State of Maryland 159 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Recognizing the importance of transit to Marylanders, Governor Hogan used SLFRF to delay the impact of the transit fare increases by one year. As a result, core service riders continued to pay $1.90 and Mobility riders continued to pay $2.10 through June 26, 2022. Full Service Was Restored for Commuter Bus and MARC: The SLFRF supported the incremental expenses incurred in restoring full service for commuter bus and MARC services, despite a continued lower level of demand. In November 2020, MARC and commuter bus services began operating under reduced schedules, as they did at the height of the pandemic emergency. Full service resumed for MARC and commuter bus services on August 30, 2021. The temporary reductions in MARC and commuter bus service included reducing service frequency while retaining the overall span of service on each route, as is implemented on holiday and snow event schedules. The reductions allowed MDOT MTA to preserve MARC train slots on the rails owned by CSX and Amtrak and the contracts with commuter bus providers. Core local bus and mobility paratransit continued to operate on their standard schedules. Transit ridership data and public feedback indicated that it was essential to preserve core bus service. Sanitizing Efforts and Employee Incentives Were Maximized: The MDOT MTA made significant efforts to ensure that touch points on transit modes were as safe as possible. Touch points were sanitized daily or even more frequently in facilities and on all MDOT MTA vehicles. The sanitizing agents were government approved. Also, MDOT MTA provided enhanced benefits to employees to reward their commitment to work during difficult conditions. Employees in certain classifications who were required to work onsite during the pandemic received a response pay differential, which is an additional $3.13 per hour. Employees also received bonus payments and incremental leave time. The SLFRF supported the sanitizing efforts and employee incentives that were necessary to maintain and restore critical transit services while pandemic conditions continued. 6A.5 - Recovery Now - Maryland Department of Transportation - State Highway Administration - State Systems Maintenance The MDOT State Highway Administration (SHA) is responsible for building and maintaining Maryland's numbered highways and bridges outside of Baltimore City. M DOT SHA also oversees operation of traffic and roadway monitoring and management, incident management, traveler information, and snow removal. As with MDOT MTA, pandemic related closures impacted MDOT SHA's operations and budget. The number of vehicle miles traveled declined from 60 billion in FY 2019 to 51 billion State of Maryland 160 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report in FY 2020, which is notable, but travelers returned to the roads quickly. Therefore, the needs for highway services did not decline as steeply as the overall revenues available to fund the services. The SLFRF allowed critical highway operations and maintenance activities to continue despite reduced revenue collections. 6A.6 - Recovery Now - Maryland Department of Transportation - Operations Support The MDOT Secretary's Office (TSO) is re sponsible for policy direction, department wide support, and administrative coordination for each of its business units, including MDOT MTA and MDOT SHA, among others. In the context of the pandemic, MDOT TSO ensured that transportation services continued to operate 24/7/365 to provide critical transportation alternatives to first responders, essential workers, and others to access jobs and medical services and to ensure the movement of goods through the Port of Baltimore, the Baltimore/Washington Internat ional Thurgood Marshall Airport, and the highway system. Throughout the COVID -19 pandemic, Maryland's transportation system has exemplified the tremendous resiliency of Maryland's people and its economy. The SLFRF provided relief to offset revenue decline s so that MDOT TSO could continue to serve as the critical backbone of coordination and communication for all of MDOT. Activities for Subproject 6A.5 - Maryland Department of Transportation - State Highway Administration - State Systems Maintenance During the pandemic, Maryland citizens returned to the roads quickly after the initial closedown phase. Furthermore, many of MDOT SHA's responsibilities in maintaining highways must continue whether traffic trends are increasing or decreasing . As a result, MDOT SHA operations had to respond swiftly to pandemic conditions to ensure that roads were continuously monitored and maintained. The SLFRF supported MDOT SHA's work in road patching, roadside mowing, debris removal, inspections, and clea ning of ditches and inlets, among other activities. Activities for Subproject 6A.6 - Recovery Now - Maryland Department of Transportation - Transit Operations Transportation services are a 24/7/365 service, and transportation has played a crucial role i n Maryland's response to the pandemic. The work of MDOT was integral to ensuring that first responders, essential workers and others could continue their work despite pandemic conditions. MDOT TSO is the central coordinating unit that ties together the wide -ranging efforts of its business units, including the State Highway Administration, the Maryland Port Administration, the Motor Vehicle Administration, the Maryland Transit Administration, and the Maryland Aviation Administration. The SLFRF support enabled MDOT TSO to oversee and coordinate MDOT's rapid responses to the pandemic. These responses included: purchasing emergency supplies such as personal protective equipment, sanitizing agents, and plexiglass to keep MDOT's workers and the traveling public safe; hosting vaccination and booster clinics for frontline MDOT employees; supporting statewide efforts to establish testing and treatment sites; deployment of technology State of Maryland 161 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report devices and software to enable remote work; development of policies and procedur es for employee telework and pandemic related leave; and administration of employee bonus incentives. Equity Related Activities Access to transportation is one of the most critical social determinants of health. For minority and low -income communities, safe and affordable mobility options are essential for overcoming long- standing disparities in the distribution of opportunities and resources. MDOT's dedication to customer service and innovation for the public good is inseparable from our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. It is central to our mission as a government agency to ensure that each member of our community has full opportunity to thrive in our environment. In 2021, MDOT MTA published its draft Statewide Transit Plan, a collec tive vision and goals to improve public transportation over the next 50 years. MDOT MTA will focus on seven overarching goals to guide Maryland's transit investments into the future. These goals are to be equitable, accessible, and affordable; ensure a sa fe and healthy transit environment; provide mobility between regions; connect people to jobs and opportunities; deliver reliable and convenient service; be sustainable, nimble, and innovative; and invest wisely and sustainably. In April 2022, as transit ridership in the Baltimore region continued to recover from the COVID - 19 pandemic, MDOT MTA announced a service realignment to expand access, improve reliability, and optimize schedules on its local bus system. On July 1, 2022, MDOT MTA released its updated Capital Needs Inventory and Prioritization Report detailing the agency's progress in reducing its State of Good Repair backlog from 16.2% of all assets to 14.4% over the last three years. Expected levels of state and federal funding through 2031 will further reduce that number to 1.3%, meeting 98% of State of Good Repair needs. Timeline The SLFRF funds allocated to MDOT have supported activities in FY 2021 and 2022, and additional funds are set to be spent in FY 2023. Give n that the funds received by MDOT are for revenue replacement for regular government operations, the activities are ongoing and largely consistent from year to year. Primary Delivery Mechanisms MDOT engages in an open, competitive, and inclusive procure ment process and strives to increase opportunities for minority- , women- , and veteran -owned business, as well as small businesses. Transit services at MDOT MTA are delivered by a combination of state workforce and contracted services. Similarly, highway operations and maintenance rely on both state and private employees to connect our customers to life's opportunities. State of Maryland 162 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Intended Outcomes The intended outcome of MDOT's use of SLFRF is to offset revenue shortfalls caused by the pandemic so that Maryland's critical transportation activities can continue. In FY 2021 and 2022, MDOT's goals were to: minimize disruptions to transportation services for Marylanders caused by the pandemic; ensure that any change in services resulting from depressed demand would preserve an essential level of service; and continue efforts already in progress to improve service performance. Equity Related Outcomes Through continued efforts to develop its Statewide Transit Plan, MDOT MTA identified strategies that it will use to progress toward its vision to deliver a transit system that will connect people, places, and opportunities with efficient, equitable, sustainable, and innovative transit. These strategies include ensuring that transit resources meet the needs to underserved and overburdened communities; continuing to welcome all people onto transit, without tolerance for harassment or discriminatory behavior; providing fully accessible training for people of all cognitive and physical abilities; reducing cost as a barrier to offering transit by offering flexible and discounted options for paying fares; and enhancing opportunities for riders to share their transit experience and show how feedback is put into action.

The agency's mission is to be a customer -driven leader that delivers safe, sustainable, intelligent, and exceptional transportation solutions in order to connect our customers to life's opportunities. Maryland Transit Administration Despite decreased ridership and revenue, MDOT MTA was able to continue to provide critical transportation services to essential workers and others. Transit ridership Source: MDOT Managing for Results submission for FY 2023. Results show gradual increases in ridership across all modes in 2022 and 2023, but not a full recovery due to new travel patterns for workers. The total transit ridership measure is based on monthly reports from each mode (except light rail, traditional mobility and taxi access) of unlinked passenger trips. - 20,000 40,000 60,000 80,000 100,000 120,000 2017 Actual 2018 Actual 2019 Actual 2020 Actual 2021 Actual 2022 Est. 2023 Est.Number of RidersMDOT MTA Total Transit Ridership, All Modes State of Maryland 164 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report On-time Performance Source: MDOT Managing for Results submission for FY 2023. The on- time performance measure shows the percent of MDOT MTA services that meet scheduled service times. On -time performance was affected by the pandemic due to staffing and scheduling challenges, but performance has rebounded. Core bus service is a highpoint in recent efforts to improve on- time performance. MDOT MTA's BaltimoreLink, launched in 2017, represents a complete overhaul and rebranding of the core bus system. Previously, the bus network had many routes that were antiquated, served outdated job locations, and were too long to manage reliably, especially those that traversed downtown Baltimore. BaltimoreLink established an efficient and reliable bus network by spreading out the routes in the downtown core and creating a grid of high- frequency routes. Infrastructure improvements have been made, including dedicated bus lanes and transit signal priority installation. As a result, core bus on- time performance has continued to rise, even in pandemic conditions. On-time per formance is a measure of quality. Performance standards are different for each mode. The calculation method is percent of trips arriving on time divided over percent of trips scheduled, including scheduled trips that were run and scheduled trips that wer e not run. On- time performance is calculated using an exception -based method by subtracting the amount of service not performed on time from the amount of total scheduled service. Core bus, Baltimore metro, light rail, and mobility paratransit use data f rom internal software systems. MARC rail data is made available by the contracted service providers. 65%70%75%80%85%90%95%100% 2017 Actual 2018 Actual 2019 Actual 2020 Actual 2021 Actual 2022 Est. 2023 Est.MDOT MTA Percent of Transit Service Provided On-time Core Bus Baltimore Metro Light Rail MARC Mobility paratransit and Taxi AccessState of Maryland 165 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Farebox Recovery Source: MDOT Managing for Results submission for FY 2023. The farebox recovery measure is the ratio of farebox revenues to operating expenses. The numerator of the equation is farebox revenues plus some non- farebox revenues, such as advertising on transit vehicles and in stations. The denominator is operating e xpenses. Capital expenditures are not included in the calculation. Although few transit systems worldwide generate sufficient revenues to cover operating expenses, farebox recovery is still a useful tool in the context of understanding the amount of operating revenues and public subsidy required to operate the transit sys tem. The COVID -19 pandemic exacerbated an existing decline in ridership, revenues, and farebox recovery, which required greater public subsidy to continue to operate the system. This need for greater public subsidy came at a time when many state revenues were also being negatively impacted by the COVID- 19 pandemic. Recovery of transit ridership and revenues is expected to occur at a much slower pace than the recovery of other transportation services, several of which have already fully rebounded from the negative impacts of the pandemic. 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%45%50% 2017 Actual 2018 Actual 2019 Actual 2020 Actual 2021 Actual 2022 Est. 2023 Est.Ratio of farebox revenues to operating expenses MDOT MTA Farebox Recovery Ratio Core Bus & Contracted Commuter Bus Metro Light Rail Baltimore area services (without Mobility paratransit) Washington Contracted Commuter Bus MARCState of Maryland 166 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report State Highway Administration Despite a temporary decline in vehicle miles traveled, travelers returned to the roads quickly and MDOT SHA maintained service levels and investments in its system. Vehicle Miles Tr aveled Source: MDOT Managing for Results submission for FY 2023. The measure of annual vehicle miles traveled decreased by approximately 16% in FY 2020 as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic national shut down orders. The lifting of these orders in 2021 resulted in a steady increase in vehicle miles traveled. Growth is expected to continue into FY 2023 and the following years. Vehicle miles traveled is an input measure. It represents the annual average daily traffic, or average number of vehicles t raversing a section of road in a day, multiplied by the length of roadway. The traffic data does not include parking lots or private streets. The measure of annual vehicle miles of travel represents the vehicles miles of travel for a particular section o f road, multiplied by 365. Annual calculations are completed each June and submitted to the Federal Highway Administration. Estimates for future years are based on a rolling average of the prior 10 years, adjusted to reflect monthly estimates, general ec onomic trends, and other factors such as weather. 60.059.660.1 50.654.956.257.5 44.046.048.050.052.054.056.058.060.062.0 2017 Actual 2018 Actual 2019 Actual 2020 Actual 2021 Actual 2022 Est. 2023 Est.Miles Traveled, in BillionsMDOT Measure of Number of Vehicle Miles TraveledState of Maryland 167 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Maintenance Activity Source: MDOT Managing for Results submission for FY 2023. Maintenance activity expenditures were affected by the COVID -19 pandemic. Shut down orders and the changes needed to keep workers safe resulted in lower than planned maintenance activity. Maintenance expenditures have rebounded and are now in line with prior levels. This is an output measure, representing expenditure data from MDOT SHA's seven maintenance districts, Office of Maintenance, Office of Traffic and Safety, Statewide Operations Center, and Office of Environmental Design. Expenditures include payroll, equipment, and usage costs. Acceptable Pavement Condition: Source: MDOT Managing for Results submission for FY 2023.

It is an estimated value based on an analysis of State of Good Repair, incorporating remaining service life measured on a scale of 0 to 50 years. Roadway mileage is defined as the number of mainline lane-miles of highways owned by MDOT SHA, including both directions of divided and undivided highways. A lane mile is one lane width multiplied by one mile in length. Data collection for ride quality, functional cracking, structural cracking, and rutting is conducted using Automated Road Analyzer (ARAN) vehicles. Friction data is collected using skid trucks. ARAN collection is conducted on highways at least one mile long on an annual basis, while routes of less than 1 mile and ramps are measured on a 3-year cycle. Typically, friction collection is conducted on highways at least one mile long, in one direction, alternating each year. Frictio n data for routes of less than 1 mile and ramps are measured on a 2- year cycle. As of June 2020, MDOT SHA adopted a new friction management approach that considers the friction demand of each roadway segment. This approach identifies sections where skid resistance is most needed and is an example of MDOT SHA's commitment to continue performance improvements even while operating under difficult pandemic conditions. Maryland Department of Transportation - Transportation Secretary's Office Transportation is an essential 24/7/365 operation that must continue to operate and be available to first responders, essential workers, and others despite pandemics or other emergencies. Performance for MDOT TSO is related to coordination and communication of performance at the MDOT business units.

State of Maryland 169 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 6A.7 - Recovery Now - Main Street The Department of Housing and Community Development's Recovery Now - Main Street Maryland grant program provided funding to the state's 33 designated Main Street Maryland communities and Baltimore City's 8 designated Main Street neighborhoods to support the economic recovery of local Main Street businesses and the economic development of Maryland communities. Funding awards were based on the Main Street's ability to demonstrate the impact and leverage of their existing or planned COVID-19 relief grant fund for businesses, the demand for additional operating resources (training, technical assistance and/or marketing) to support the businesses, and the Main Street's ability to award grant funds and/or provide other resources to those businesses no later than June 30,2021. Eligible uses were for existing and/or planned small business relief grant programs, administered by the local government or nonprofit applicant, that would provide businesses assistance with costs related to capital improveme nts and/or operating in order for the business to continue to safely operate, expand operations and/or adapt their business model to respond to changes due to COVID19 restrictions and prevention. No more than 15% of the requested funds could be used for operating support that would specifically benefit Main Street businesses such as training, technical assistance and/or marketing efforts such as, but not limited to: assisting Main Street businesses establish online sales, design and merchandise training to adapt retail space to accommodate COVID -19 requirements, providing small business counseling or offering a buy local/gift card program to support Main Street businesses The Department of Housing and Community Development paid awarded funds directly to the local government or nonprofit organization that administers the local Main Street effort for state or Baltimore City designated Main Street communities The application round opened on November 2, 2020 and closed on November 20, 2020. Governor Hogan announced the awards in February 2021. All of the state's 33 designated Main Street Maryland communities and Baltimore City's 8 designated Main Street neighborhoods applied for and received awards of funding to support their operating and capital grants to businesses in their Main Street districts. All funding was distributed to awardees by March 30, 2021 and awardees utilized those funds by June 30, 2021 Governor Hogan Announces $7 Million in Emergency Relief Awards for Main Street Communities There were 5,040 businesses (3,892 in Main Street Maryland communities and 1,148 in Baltimore City Main Streets) that were eligible to apply.

The Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) conducts administrative hearings on behalf of the state and other government agencies. By law, persons adversely affected by agency actions are entitled to an administrative hearing. The hearings are conducted by Administrative Law Judges who adjudicate questions of fact and law. Each year, the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) charges state agencies a predetermined fee based on the number of hearings that were conducted in relation to the agency during the prior fiscal year. The Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) typically pays its OAH fee using revenue from the Housing Counseling and Foreclosure Mediation Fund (\u00a7 4-507). This revenue is collected from foreclosure- related filing fees. The state's foreclosure moratorium throughout the COVID- 19 pandemic resulted in a revenue shortfall. The $1,100,000 budget for this subproject was used to offset the shortfall in FY 2021 to cover the fee to OAH.

Maryland.gov also won best in class from the Interactive Media Awards in 2022. Maryland's ongoing push toward a unified and mobile- friendly citizen experience across all channel s is mission critical to equity related awareness, access, distribution. COVIDLINK provides a central source for public access to vaccine, testing and treatment, and contact tracing resources. DoI T and MDH have partnered to develop \"COVID Link\", a state-of- the-art data management platform, to facilitate the state's contact -tracing effort. The platform is fully operational in all 24 jurisdictions. The innovative COVID Link platform uses medical data from the Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients (CRISP) so that officials gain crucial information to determine steps to lower the risk of the virus spreading. Maryland OneStop Portal is an innovative approach to citizen engagement as it provides a single location for locating and submitting forms, and license and certification applications across the state government. Visitors benefit from intelligent search features and an intuitive, user- frien dly design. The OneStop Portal is also reducing the cost and burden for state agencies. Through the use of the OneStop Portal's powerful workflow engine, state agencies can now retire proprietary, custom license systems and fold forms and license processing operations into the tools provided by the OneStop Portal. State of Maryland 172 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report DoIT developed and launched multiple applications on the OneStop Portal during the COVID-19 pandemic including: Maryland Small Business COVID-19 Emergency Relief Loan Fund Maryland Small Busines s COVID-19 Emergency Relief Grant Fund Manufacturing Innovation Grant Application DoIT implemented approval workflows for the Department of Commerce to process these applications as well as customized notifications to the applicants for when their applications are approved, denied, or missing documentation. Over 40,000 users are engaged with the new system. DoIT was able to integrate these applications into the OneStop Portal in days, saving Commerce valuable time (and cost) versus building a new system. Throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic, the OneStop portal demonstrated its true value as a platform, as DoIT and the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) administered numerous pandemic assistance programs for affected communities and loc al businesses, including: Nonprofit Recovery Initiative (NORI) NORI for Behavioral Health Administration Strong Economic Recovery Initiative (SERI) for Entertainment Venues SERI for Tourism SERI for Mainstreet Project RESTORE Community Safety Works (CSW) 6A.10 - Vaccination Lottery In an effort to get every eligible Marylander vaccinated, the Maryland Lottery partnered with the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) to thank vaccinated Marylanders while also incentivizing new vaccinations. Governor Larry Hogan launched a $2 Million VaxCash Promotion. The promotion awarded cash prizes to a total of 41 Maryland residents who have been vaccinated. Drawings were held daily from Tuesday, May 25 through Sunday, July 4. Maryland residents 18 and older who received a COVID-19 vaccination in Maryland at any time were eligible to win with no registration or entry needed. Each day from May 25 through July 3, one winner was randomly drawn to win a $40,000 prize with the final drawing on the Fourth of July awarding one winner a grand prize of $400,000. Working in close collaboration with MDH, the Lottery assigned a number in a secure system for each Maryland resident aged 18 or older who received their vaccination. The system was maintained by MDH, which serves as the custodian of Maryland's vaccination records. Separately, the Lottery used a random number generator to select a winning number each day from the total number of people that had been vaccinated. State of Maryland 173 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 6A.11- COVID 19 Steady State On June 9, 2022, Governor Larry Hogan announced COVIDReady Maryland , the state's long- term preparedness plan to maximize the tools and treatments available to keep people healthy and out of the hospital, and maintain a state of readiness to respond to emerging variants and potential waves. The plan, which emphasizes infrastructure, awareness, and adaptability, builds on the successful data-driven strategies that the state implemented throughout the pandemic. SLFRF has been allocated to support COVIDReady Maryland. Prospective project activities may include: Expanded 'Test To Treat' Provider Infrastructure. 'Test to Treat' makes it easy for patients to get tested, evaluated, and treated during the same visit at the same location. Over the last three months, the state has nearly doubled its 'Test To Treat' sites to nearly 90 locations\u2014including the State Center site in Baltimore City . With a focus on equitable geographical distribution to ensure Marylanders can easily access treatments, the Maryland Department of Health is preparing dozens more urgent care and ambulatory care locations to be ready to provide these services by the fall. Find a 'Test to Treat' site . Maximizing Utilization of Therapeutics . Therapeutics are a relatively new tool in the fight against COVID-19, but they are quickly becoming increasingly prevalent. In a month span this spring, therapeutic usage increased by 248%. While these treatments are not cures, they have a very high success rate of keeping people out of the hospital. State health officials will continue to encourage both patients and providers to take advantage of these treatments, which are now available at roughly 800 locations statewide. Learn more about COVID-19 treatments and therapeutics . Booster Shots for Eligible Populations . Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated and boosted states in America. The state maintains a robust vaccination infrastructure \u2014well over 900 providers \u2014and is focused on getting more eligible populations boosted. With all the evolving guidance coming from the federal government, state health officials have launched a new \"Are You Up -To-Date?\" portal that will allow you to check your vaccination status within seconds. Find a vaccination clinic near you . Enhanced Awareness and Outreach . The state's GoVAX Call Center (1 -855- MD- GOVAX) continues to be available seven days a week, and has now booked nearly 2 million appointments. In addition to providing a number of services for help with getting tested and vaccinated, the call center is conducting aggressive outreach around boosters and therapeutics. As of today, the call center's volume includes more than 31.4 million calls and more than 16.5 million text messages. In addition, today, state health officials launched a new series of television, radio, and social media ads fe aturing Maryland State of Maryland 174 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report families sharing their reasons for getting vaccinated against COVID-19. The state also continues to partner with community-based organizations, including the NAACP, with a focus on equity. State of Readiness for Variants and Waves . Marylan d's multi- agency COVID -19 task force continues to meet on a daily basis and aggressively monitor key data metrics. The state will continue to maintain the building blocks of the state's successful Roadmap to Recovery, including substantial PCR and rapid at-home testing capacity; a robust stockpile of masks and PPE; contact tracing for high-priority cases; and hospital surge capacity. In addition, the state has provided record funding for local health departments to help bolster their preparedness efforts as well.

SLFRF Project 7A provides financial support by transferring SLFRF to other units of government. It includes six subprojects. 7A.1 - Education Trust Fund Backfill This SLFRF project is to p rovide the funds necessary to offset the pandemic- related deficit in the Education Trust Fund used to fund the Foundation Program in fiscal year (FY) 2021. The Maryland State Department of Education worked with the Comptroller's General Accounting Division to move FY 2021 special fund transactions for the Foundation Program to FY 2022 SLFRF prior to 6/30/22 using a journal adjustment. State of Maryland 177 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 7A.2 - Fiscal Relief for Local Health Departments' self -supported fee -for- service Clinics This SLFRF project provides fiscal relief to Self -supported Fee -for-service Clinics to assist with COVID -19 related revenue shortfalls. No expenditures have been made for this project. The state will provide an update on this project shortly. 7A.3 - Hom e Detention for Early Release Maryland courts may require, as a condition of a defendant's pretrial release, that the defendant be monitored by a private home detention monitoring agency (PHDMA). A defendant placed in private home detention must pay the a gency's monitoring fee directly to the PHDMA. Legislation passed during the 2021 Maryland legislative session (House Bill 316) prohibits a pretrial defendant from being required to pay a PHDMA for any costs or fees incurred if the defendant: 1. qualifies as indigent under \u00a7 16- 210 of the Maryland Criminal Procedure Article or 2. is provided a private home detention monitoring device or global positioning system device by the state or a local jurisdiction. Instead, the state must pay a PHDMA for any costs or fees incurred by defendants who meet this criteria. The bill took effect on July 1, 2021, and generally remains effective until one year after the end of the governor's proclamation of the COVID -19 state of emergency. Maryland utilized $5 million in SLFRF to support the implementation of this new requirement. Funding was provided to the Maryland Legal Services Corporation (MLSC) to implement the project. Use of Evidence According to the Centers for Disease Control, correctional and detention facilities fac e unique COVID- 19 challenges, such as high risk of viral introduction and high risk of rapid transmission. 25 Pre-trial defendants that do not have the economic resources for home monitoring fees are confined to a detention facility with an increased risk of COVID- 19. The American Bar Association notes that pre -trial detention has a disproportionate impact on communities of color and exacerbates economic hardships.26 Performance Recipients (defendants) and funding by zip code/census tract Recipient demog raphic info (e.g. race/ethnicity, of Maryland 178 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 7A.4 - Private Sector Telework This SLFRF project provided funding to local governments for grants of up to $5,000 to businesses to improve employee telework opportunities. The Maryland Economic Development Assistance Authority and Fund (MEDAAF), within the Department of Commerce, provided grants to local jurisdictions (all 23 counties and Baltimore City). During the pandemic, telework opportunities helped certain businesses to reduce risk of COVID -19 transmission, increased retention, and offered businesses a wider applicant pool for recruiting. Telework support funding was awarded to local jurisdictions in July and August 2021. Local jurisdictions then solicited grant applications and awarded grants to businesses to either facilitate new telework expansion or reimburse businesses for previous telework expenses. Outcomes Increased financial viability of businesses by adopting telework policies Reduced COVID -19 transmission risk 7A.5 - Recovery Now - Department of Budget and Management - Disparity Grants To mitigate the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on local jurisdictions' ability to raise revenue, the Disparity Grant Program provided noncategorical state aid to low -wealth jurisdictio ns for use by local governments. Disparity grants address the difference in the abilities of counties to raise revenues from the local income tax, which for most counties is one of their larger revenue sources. Counties with per capita income tax revenues less than 75% of the statewide average receive grants unless a county has an income tax rate below 2.6%. Under current law, aid received by counties equals the lesser of the dollar amount necessary to raise the county's per capita income tax revenues to 75% of the statewide average or the amount received under capped provisions. SLFRF were used to provide additional grants to three jurisdictions to mitigate the impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) worked with the Comptroller's Office to process the transfer payments totaling $5 million. DBM initiated the transfer of funds on March 4, 2021 and direct vouchers were issued on March 9th. $3,498,738 to Prince George's County $360,034 to Dorchester County $1,141,228 to Wicomico County State of Maryland 179 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report 7A.6 - Substitute for Public Health Costs This SLFRF project provides operating grants to all 24 Local Health Departments that can be used for ten core services areas as outlined in Maryland Code, and to address COVID- 19 related revenu e shortfalls. Funds were distributed between 7/1/2021 - 6/30/2022. The assistance also helps to address increased demand for services going forward. Project expenditures are less than 50% complete.

Timeline 3/3/2021 - 12/31/2026 State of Maryland 181 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report SLFRF Management In government, as it is in business, innovation, quantification, and orchestration requires a system of people, processes, and technology that work together each day. The pandemic disrupted traditional work systems creatin g challenges. This section describes how SLFRF can be used to create opportunities for improved management: utilizing data analytics, learning agendas, performance evaluations, and partnerships. On July 29, 2021, Governor Larry Hogan signed Executive Order 01.01.2021.09 establishing the State Chief Data Officer. The order describes the position's responsibilities, and important data governance, data quality, data sharing, and data management requirements that build on the successful data-driven strategies that the state implemented throughout the pande mic. The order states that \"data use and management must be prioritized, standardized, and coordinated between state units to maximize efficiency and cost effectiveness of service delivery.\" For SLFRF, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) created the SLFRF Management System. Using Treasury- compliant metadata templates, DBM created the Maryland SLFRF Data Model. When SLFRF project teams report progress on obligations, expenditures, performance, and other compliance reporting requirements each month, the Maryland SLFRF Data Model standardizes the data and makes it available for ad -hoc and scheduled reporting, data mining, sharing, and in analytics and dashboards for management. Data governance is enforced through the Chief Data Officer's framework. Data storage, analytics, and collaboration software are provided by the Department of Information Technology as a shared service to SLFRF project teams. The Department of Budget and Management implemented a professional development curriculum based on the U.S. Treasury's SLFRF Compliance and Reporting Guidance . Live and on-demand training classes, a knowledge repository, and a collaboration space for SLFRF project teams help to ensure coordination for project and performance management.

State of Maryland 183 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Appendix A - Annual Report Templates Used in the Data Collection Process To compile this annual report, SLFRF project teams completed a template that asked the following questions. In some cases, for example, in water, sewer, and broadband infrastructure projects, additional information was requested including labor practices, per the U.S. Treasury's SLFRF Compliance and Reporting Guidance . Project Description Provide a description of the project. Describe how funds are being used to respond to negative economic impacts of the COVID -19 public health emergency, including to households and small businesses. The U.S. Treasury encourages uses of funds that promote strong, equitable growth, including racial equity. Please describe how your project's planned or current use of funds prioritizes economic and racial equity as a goal, names specific targets intended to produce meaningful equity results at- scale and articulates the strategies to achieve those targets. For example, assistance to households, small businesses, and nonprofits to address impacts of the pandemic, which have been most severe among low-income populations. This includes assistance with food, housing, and other needs; employment programs with barriers to employment who faced negative economic impacts from the pandemic (such as residents of low-income neighborhoods, minorities, disconnected youth, the unemployed, formerly incarcerated people, Veterans, and people with disabilities); and other strategies that provide disadvantaged groups with access to education, jobs, and opportunity. Project Activities Provide an overview of the main activities of the project. Equity Related Activities As appropriate, include efforts to date to promote equity. For example, are there particularly historically underserved, marginalized, or adversely affected groups that you intend to serve with project activities? Community Engagement Related Activities Please describe how your project's planned or current use of funds incorporates written, oral, and other forms of input that capture diverse feedback from constituents, community- based organizations, and the communities themselves. Where relevant, this description must include how funds will build the capacity of community organizations to serve people with significant barriers to services, including people of color, people with low incomes, limited English speaking proficiency populations, and other traditionally underserved groups. Timeline Provide the approximate timeline of the project and/or subprojects. State of Maryland 184 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners Describe the primary delivery mechanisms and partners. Equity Related Awareness, Access, and Distribution How equal and practical is the ability for residents or businesses to become aware of the services funded by the project? Are there differences in levels of access to services across groups? Are th ere administrative requirements that result in disparities /ability to complete applications or meet eligibility criteria? Intended Outcomes Describe the outcomes the project intends to achieve. Equity Related Outcomes Are intended outcomes focused on closing gaps, reaching universal levels of service, or disaggregating progress by race, ethnicity, or other equity dimensions where relevant for the policy objective? Describe any constraints or challenges that impacted project success in terms of increasing equity. This section must describe the geographic and demographic distribution of funding, including whether activities target traditionally marginalized communities. Project Website Provide a link to the website of the project if available . Use of Evidence Briefly describe the goals of the project, and whether SLFRF funds are being used for evidence - based interventions, the evidence -base for the interventions, and/or if projects are being evaluated through rigorous program evaluations tha t are designed to build evidence. Identify the dollar amount of project spending allocated towards evidence -based interventions. Recipients are encouraged to use relevant evidence clearinghouses, among other sources, to assess the level of evidence for their interventions and identify evidence -based models that could be applied in their project. Recipients are exempt from reporting evidence -based interventions in cases where a program evaluation is being conducted. If a recipient is conducting a program evaluation in lieu of reporting the amount of spending on evidence -based interventions, they must describe the evaluation design. Performance Report Report on key performance indicators (performance measures). Include both output and outcome measures. If your project is completed or underway, then report each performance measure, its results, targets (if applicable), trend analysi s (if applicable), and narrative providing context to help the reader interpret the results. If your project has not started yet, then simply list the performance measures you plan to use. Provide data disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, income, and other relevant factors, if possible. State of Maryland 185 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Appendix B - Defining Disadvantaged Geographies Reference data is often used in data analytics to provide a basis for calculations and analysis. Reference data is also used to simply provide context. For example, many SLFRF projects have eligibility criteria expressed as a percentage of poverty level 27: The State of Maryland uses various formulas to calculate disadvantaged geographies, underserved populations, and overburdened areas. Depending on the use case, agencies may calculate these populations based on the laws, regulations, and policies most relevant to the government program it serves. The following are three examples: Using the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 10.62.01.01(B)(13) definition of Economically Disadvantaged Areas and U.S. Census Bureau demographic data to identify geographies. For example, the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission guidance identifies 61 of Maryland's 468 zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) as Economically Disadvantaged Areas using this approach. The Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022 defines underserved and overburdened populations. U.S. Census Bureau data and other data sources are then used to identify census tracts that meet the criteria as underserved and/or overburdened. Investments in broadband may be identified using the Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022 definitions. 27 2022 Poverty Guidelines; U.S. Dep artment of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation State of Maryland 186 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report The D epartment of Commerce and the Department of Housing and Community Development use multiple sources to define Disadvantaged Geographic Areas, including the U.S. Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) map, Qualified Census Tracts, HUB Zones, and Opportunity Zones. Investments in broadband may be identified this way too. Or using a combination of sources. One of the challenges to using data analytics with all of the various definitions is to understand the context for when an agency applies the right definition to the right government program. The Department of Budget and Management did not require agencies to use one standard definition for equity analysis across the entire portfolio of SLFRF projects. Instead, DBM provided the flexibility for agencies to use their best definition for each project. This also created an opportunity to strengthen the cross- agency collaboration between analysts, grants managers, and program managers tasked with improving equity- related data analytics. DBM's learning agenda includes lowering the data literacy barrier so that more state employees have the skills and easy -to-use tools to perform equity analysis. The following are more details about the three examples: Defining Economically Disadvantaged Areas Example #1 The Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 10.62.01.01(B)(13) defines Economically Disadvantaged Areas as having: A median income that is 80 percent or less of the average median household income in the state; An unemployment r ate that is at least 150 percent of the unemployment rate in the state; A health uninsured rate that is at least 150 percent of the health uninsured rate in the state; A food stamp or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Plan (SNAP) rate that is at least 150 percent of the food stamp or SNAP Rate in the state; and A poverty rate that is at least 150 percent of the poverty rate in the state. The Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission (MMCC) evaluated each metric using the 2012-2016 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) to identify sixty-one (61) zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) that qualify as Economically Disadvantaged Areas in Maryland and published them in its Guidance for Identifying Economically Disadvantaged Areas on January 11, 2019. State of Maryland 187 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Defining Underserved and Overburdened Example #2 The Maryland Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022 defined Underserved Community and Overburdened Community. The Maryland Department of the Environment created the Environmental Justice Screening Tool in June 2022 to align with recently enacted legislation. The state's Justice40 -related compliance is found within the legislation. The Environmental Justice Screening Tool uses the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) data. It is the latest ACS data published by the U.S. Census Bureau. Climate Solutions Now Act definitions: Underserved Community An underserved community means any census tract in which, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau Survey (currently the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey): At least 25% of the residents qualify as low income; At least 50% of residents identify as nonwhite; OR At least 15% of the residents have limited English proficiency Overburdened Means any census tract for which three (3) or more of the following environmental health indicators are above the 75 th percentile statewide: Particulate matter (PM) 2.5, Ozone, National Air Toxi cs Assessment (NATA) Diesel PM, NATA Cancer Risk, NATA Respiratory Hazard Index, Traffic Proximity, Lead Paint Indicator, National Priorities List Superfund Site Proximity, Risk Management Plan Facility Proximity, Hazardous Waste Proximity, Wastewater D ischarge Indicator, Proximity to a Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO), Percent of the Population Lacking Broadband Coverage, Asthma Emergency Room Discharges, Myocardial Infarction Discharges, Low-Birth Weight Infants, Proximity to Emitting Pow er Plants, Proximity to a Toxic Research Inventory Facility, Proximity to a Brownfields Site, Proximity to Mining Operations, Proximity to a Hazardous Waste Landfill State of Maryland 188 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report Defining Disadvantaged Geographic Areas Example #3 - Includes multiple sources For reducing negative economic impacts, the Maryland Department of Commerce uses data from official federal sources to establish an overall map of Disadvantaged Geographic Areas. The Department of Housing and Community Development also utilizes one or more of these sources, depending on the program. The Department of Commerce use them together to create a final map with: Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Qualified Census Tracts Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI): Severely Distressed Areas Qualified Low Income Community Investment (QLICI): Severely Distressed Areas HUB Zones Qualified Opportunity Zones Final Map of Economically Disadvantaged Areas The final map shows all of Maryland's census tracts (using the 2010 definition) that are disadvantaged. Out of 1,394 land census tracts (an additional 12 tracts represent water areas), 433 are marked as economically -disadvantaged by one or more Federal programs. An additional four are marked as \"adjacent\" opportunity zones , which means that they are not actually in distress but are adjacent to tracts that are. Commerce may choose to exclude adjacent opportunity zones as they themselves are not economically disadvantaged. State of Maryland 189 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report The tract breakdown by jurisdiction is as follows: Row Labels Adjacent OZ Disadvantaged Not Disadvantaged Total Percent Disadvantaged 001 Allegany 9 14 23 39% 003 Anne Arundel 6 98 104 5% 005 Baltimore 44 170 214 20% 009 Calvert 1 2 15 18 16% 011 Caroline 3 6 9 33% 013 Carroll 1 37 38 2% 015 Cecil 3 16 19 15% 017 Charles 1 6 23 30 23% 019 Dorchester 9 9 100% 021 Frederick 12 49 61 19% 023 Garrett 7 7 100% 025 Harford 8 49 57 14% 027 Howard 1 54 55 2% 029 Kent 1 4 5 20% 031 Montgomery 34 181 215 16% 033 Prince George's 2 93 123 218 47% 035 Queen Anne's 1 10 11 9% 037 St. Mary's 1 16 17 6% 039 Somerset 6 1 7 86% 041 Talbot 2 8 10 20% 043 Washington 10 32 31% 045 Wicomico 10 9 19 53% 047 Worcester 16 16 100% 510 Baltimore City 148 52 200 74% State Total 4 433 957 1394 31% To test this map with real-world data, recipients of the COVID-19 Emergency Grant Program were mapped. Of the 14,286 recipients who were mailed a grant relief check prior to February 12, 2021 under this program, 25.4 percent were located within an economically disadvantaged geographic area according to these definitions. Of the total $141 million that was disbursed prior to February 12, 25.4 percent was sent to companies located in economically disadvantaged geographic areas. However, as the table below shows, there was a great deal of variation between each county. All recipients in two counties (Dorchester and Garrett) were counted as being disadvantaged due to the classification of each county as a rural HUB Zone. Conversely, no grant recipients were counted as being economically disadvantaged in Howard County, as there are almost no economically disadvantaged areas located within its borders.

LIHTC Qualified Census Tracts Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Qualified Census Tracts, as defined under the section 42(d)(5)(C) of the of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, include any census tract (or equivalent geographic area defined by the Bureau of the Census) in which at least 50 percent of households have an income less than 60 percent of the Area Median Gross Income (AMGI), or whi ch has a poverty rate of at least 25 percent. CDFI Severely Distressed Areas The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund) was created for the purpose of promoting economic revitalization and community development through investment in and assistance to Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs). The CDFI Fund was established by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, as a bipartisan initiative. The CDFI Fund ac hieves its purpose by promoting access to capital and local economic growth in the following ways: State of Maryland 191 2022 SLFRF Annual Performance Report through its Community Development Financial Institutions Program by directly investing in, supporting and training CDFIs that provide loans, investments, financial services and technical assistance to underserved populations and communities; through its New Markets Tax Credit Program by providing an allocation of tax credits to Community Development Entities which enable them to attract investment from the private -sector and reinvest these amounts in low -income communities; through its Bank Enterprise Award Program by providing an incentive to banks to invest in their communities and in other CDFIs; through its Native Initiatives, by taking acti on to provide financial assistance, technical assistance, and training to Native CDFIs and other Native entities proposing to become or create Native CDFIs; through its CDFI Bond Guarantee Program by issuing bonds to support CDFIs that make investments for eligible community or economic development purposes; and through its Capital Magnet Fund, which offers competitively awarded grants to finance affordable housing solutions for low -income people and low -income communities nationwide.
