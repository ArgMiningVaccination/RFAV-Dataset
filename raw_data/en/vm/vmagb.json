April 2013. www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/reports/final.cfm. iii Preface The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), through its Evidence -based Practice Centers (EPCs), sponsors the development of systematic reviews to assist public - and private -sector organizations in their efforts to improve the quality of health care in the United States. These reviews provide comprehensive, science- based information on common, costly medical conditions, and new health care technologies and strategies. Systematic reviews are the building blocks underlying evide nce-based practice; they focus attention on the strength and limits of evidence from research studies about the effectiveness and safety of a clinical intervention. In the context of developing recommendations for practice, systematic reviews can help clar ify whether assertions about the value of the intervention are based on strong evidence from clinical studies. For more information about AHRQ EPC systematic reviews, see www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/reference/purpose.cfm . AHRQ expects that these syst ematic reviews will be helpful to health plans, providers, purchasers, government programs, and the health care system as a whole. Transparency and stakeholder input from are essential to the Effective Health Care Program. Please visit the Web site (www.ef fectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov) to see draft research questions and reports or to join an e-mail list to learn about new program products and opportunities for input. We welcome comments on this systematic review. They may be sent by mail to the Task Order Officer named below at: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 540 Gaither Road, Rockville, MD 20850, or by email to epc@ahrq.hhs.gov. Carolyn M.

They are selected to provide broad exper tise and perspectives specific to the topic under development. Divergent and conflicted opinions are common and perceived as health y scientific discourse that results in a thoughtful, relevant systematic review. Therefore study questions, design, and/or me thodological approaches do not necessarily represent the views of individual technical and content experts. Technical Experts provide information to the EPC to identif y literature search strategies and recommend approaches to specific issues as requested b y the EPC. Technical Experts do not do analysis of any kind nor contribute to the writing of the report and have not reviewed the report, except as given the opportunity to do so through the peer or public review mechanism Technical Experts must disclose any financial conflicts of interest greater than $10,000 and any other relevant business or professional conflicts of interes t. Because of their unique clinical or content expertise, individuals are invited to serve as Technical Experts , and those who prese nt with potential conflicts may be retained.

(1) To assess the comparative effectiveness of interventions (psychosocial and/or pharmacological) for children age 0 to 14 exposed to maltreatment in addressing child well - being outcomes (mental and behavioral health; caregiver -child relationship; cognitive, language, and physical development; school -based functioning) and child welfare outcomes (safety, placement stability, and permanency); (2) To assess the comparative effectiveness of interventions (a) with different treatment characteris tics, (b) for child and caregiver subgroups, and (c) for engaging and retaining children and/or caregivers in treatment; and (3) To assess harms associated with interventions for this population. Data Sources . MEDLINE \u00ae, PsycINFO\u00ae, Social Science Citation Index\u00ae, and the Cochrane Library. Additional studies were identified from reference lists and technical experts . Review Methods . A team of reviewers, including clinicians specializing in child trauma treatment, independently reviewed , extracted data fro m, and rated the risk of bias of relevant trials. Decisions required agreement between two independent reviewers, with disagreements regarding inclusion or exclusion resolved by a third. We qualitatively synthesized results; quantitative analysis was not a ppropriate due to clinical heterogeneity, insufficien t numbers of similar studies, and wide variation in outcome reporting . Results . We found a total of 2 4 trials and 1 cohort study of either medium or low risk of bias from our review of 6,282 unduplicat ed abstracts. Although pharmacotherapy was included in our definition of interventions for this review , we did not identify any eligible studies for inclusion. Our main finding was that the literature in this field is strikingly limited due to numerous substantive and methodological gaps. These limitations include (a) the predominance of single trials conducted by the treatment developers testing unique interventions which often employ strategies very similar to those of o ther approaches, (b) usual care, wa it-list, or derived controls rather than head -to-head comparisons with bona fide alternative treatments , (c) short -term outcomes, (d) inadequate reporting of attrition, and (e) wide heterogeneity in type and psychometric soundness of outcome measurement ac ross studies. Given the nascent state of the field, it is too early to make strong recommendations based on the available comparative effectiveness research. However, our review suggests that several interventions show promising child well- being and child welfare benefits and summarizes these findings by salient population subgroups including child age, type of maltreatment, and caregiving context (maltreating parents or foster/kinship parents). Conclusions . This review serves as an urgent call for improving and building the evidence base for interventions to promote the well -being of maltreated children. A multisite research network is a powerful platform t hat could facilitate the conduct of large, methodologically rigorous comparative efficacy and effect iveness trials needed to move the field forward. More broadly, a paradigm shift is required on the part of researchers and funders alike to galvanize the commitment and resources necessary for conducting collaborative clinical trials with these particularl y vulnerable children and families. ix Contents Executive Summary .................................................................................................................ES -1

Full Text Review Excludes Appendix D. Risk of Bias Tables Appendix E. Evidence Tables ES-1 Executive Summary Background Condition and Therapeutic Strategies Child maltreatment is a global public health problem.1,2 In the United States alone , approximately 6.2 million c hildren were involved in 3.4 million referrals to Child Protective Services (CPS) in FY2011.3 The prevalence of child maltreatment translates into a significant economic burden to society, cutting across many different service sectors including child welfare, health and mental care, special education, and criminal justice. A recent U.S. study estimates that the aggregate lifetime costs of nonfatal and fa tal child maltreatment (in 2010 dollars) are $124 billion.4 Exposure to abuse and/or neglect in childhood has serious adverse consequences across the life span, including increased risk of emotional and behavioral disturbances, delinquency and violent crime, and chronic disease.1,2,5 -12 This comparative effectiveness r eview (CER)13 focuses on parenting interventions, trauma - focused treatments, and enhanced foster care approaches that address child exposure to maltreatment. It is the first in a two -part series focusing on clinical (psychosocial and/or pharmacological) interventions for children exposed to traumatic experiences. The second review in the series focuses on clinical interventions with children exposed to traumatic events other than maltreat ment . Both reviews were carried out under the auspices of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 's (AHRQ) Effective Health Care Program, the goal of which is to improve the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of health care delivery 14 with highly rigorous and transparent systematic reviews. The goal of this review is twofold: to provide stakeholders with a synthesis of the best evidence in the field of child maltreatment and to identify critical areas to address in future intervention research . Scope and Key Questions This review provides a critical analysis and synthesis of the comparative efficacy and effectiveness of interventions (psychosocial and pharmacological) that address child well -being and/or promote positive child welfare outcomes (safety, placement stability, and permanency) for maltreated children ages birth to 14 years . The review also examines (1) how interventions with different characteristics (modality, theoretical orientation, setting) compare in improving child outcomes, (2) how interventions compare in terms of treatment engagement and retention, and (3) adverse events associated with the interventions or comparators reviewed. The review highlights gaps in the current scientific litera ture and important areas for future research to build the evidence base for interventions with maltreated children. Although pharmacotherapy was included in our definition of interventions for this review, we did not identify any eligible studies for inclu sion. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for studies reviewed in this CER were defined using the PICOTS (populations, interventions, comparators, outcomes, timing, settings) framework . We call attention to several difficult exclusion decisions that were made to enhance the generalizability of the review in light of extensive clinical heterogeneity in the literature. First, we excluded studies with families broadly identified as \" at risk \" due to sociodemographic or other risk factors for maltreatment. The intent of this exclusion criterion was to focus the review ES-2 on children with a known maltreatment history or involvement with child protective services (CPS). Although children at risk and children with known maltreatment exposure can present similar risk and clinical profiles ,15-17 intervention with parents involved with CPS presents markedly different therapeutic and operational challenges compared with preventive intervention with children at risk . Second, we excluded older adolescents ( 15 years) in recognition of the major shift in developmental needs and capacities during middle and late adolescence (e.g., autonomy , physical maturity , emphasis on peer relationships ). 18 In both exclusion cases, if a trial included children from the included group and the excluded group, t he study was included in the review if data from the two groups could be disaggregated in data abstraction. Third, s ystems - or service- delivery level approaches were excluded so as to focus on \" clinical- level \" interventions at the child, parent, and family level s. We recognize that s ystems approaches, such as differential response and solution- focused casework , are well -accepted and widely used within child welfare and affect the work of related care systems. At th e same time, these approaches and their evaluations were so diverse that they warranted a separate review. We acknowledge that these exclusion decisions may have resulted in the exclusion of trials that, arguably, might bolster evidence for included interventions or support inclusion of other interventions. We also recognize these exclusions, particularly related to excluding \" mixed \" populations combining children at risk with children with known maltreatment or CPS involvement, may be considered a rarified approach by some. Our intent was threefol d: (1) to reduce the noise of clinical heterogeneity that currently undermines the extant evidence base, (2) to maintain the rigorous approach for study inclusion that has been employed across AHRQ CERs, and (3) to avert yet more heterogeneity due to inconsistent, vague, or absent definitions of samples of children defined as at risk or an admixture of at risk and maltreated. As we attempted to follow these principles, we have striven for the utmost clarity in delineating our decisions for the reader. With these perspectives in mind, we believe that this review makes a groundbreaking contribution to the field by challenging researchers, clinicians, and policymakers to stringently assess the strength of the available evidence so as to chart clear direction fo r future of research. Key Questions This review sought to address the following key questions (KQs) : KQ 1 . What is the comparative effectiveness of interventions with children exposed to maltreatment for promoting child well- being outcomes ? Specifically: a. Mental and behavioral health (e.g., severity or number of traumatic stress symptoms or syndromes; post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); attachment disorders; depressive symptoms; anxiety symptoms; disruptive, aggressive, and delinquent behavior) b. Healthy caregiver -child relationship (e.g., secure attachment; caregiver responsivity and sensitivity ; positive parental attitudes toward childrearing ; parental perceptions of the child and causal attributions about the child' s behavior ; caregiver -child interaction s; and family functioning) c. Healthy development (e.g., cognitive, language, physical maturation ) d. School -based functioning (e.g., grade retention, disciplinary referrals, attendance) KQ 2 . What is the comparative effectiveness of interventions with children exposed to maltreatment for promoting child welfare outcomes? Specifically: a. Safety (i.e., prevention of maltreatment recurrence) ES-3 b. Placement stability for children in out -of-home care c. Positive p ermanency outcomes for children in out -of-home care KQ 3 . Amon g the interventions under review, how do interventions with particular characteristics compare in improving child outcomes ? Specifically : a. Modality (i.e., individual, dyadic, group, family -based format ) b. Theoretical orientation (e.g., cognitive behavioral, psychodynamic) c. Type of setting (i.e., specialty or nonspecialty service -delivery settings) KQ 4 . How do interventions compare for improving child outcomes within population subgroups? Specifically : a. Child subgroups i. Age and other sociodemographic subgroups ( e.g., race, ethnicity, sex) ii. Type of maltreatment exposure (e.g., neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse) iii. Severity of maltreatment exposure iv. Presence of mental or behavioral health problems (e.g., complex traumatic stress disorders, serious emotional distur bance) or other special needs (e.g., failure to thrive, prenatal substance exposure) b. Caregiver subgroups i. Primary caregiving context (e.g., biological parent; foster, kin [ relative ], or adoptive caregivers; residential program or group home) ii. Presence of mental health problems, substance abuse, or domestic violence iii. Sociodemographic groups (e.g., age, race, ethnicity, sex) KQ 5 . What is the comparative effectiveness of interventions with children exposed to maltreatment for engaging children and/or caregive rs in treatment (e.g., treatment adherence, treatment withdrawal)? KQ 6 . What adverse events are associated with interventions for children exposed to maltreatment (e.g., retraumatization, caregiver distress)? The analytic framework we developed to guide the systematic review process is shown in Figure A. ES-4 Figure A. Analytic framework aPopulation may include the child 's primary caregiver(s) when the intervention targets the caregiving context. Methods A team of researchers conducted this review using th e methods described in AHRQ 's Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews .19 The team included three clinical psychologists, a family medicine physician, and a developmental psychologist all specializing in child maltreatment, as well as several researchers with expertise in AHRQ CER methodolog y. Topic Refinement The topic was nominated in a public process. With key informant input, the RTI-UNC Evidence -based Practice Center ( EPC) clarified the scope of the project. After we generated an analytic framework, preliminary KQs, and preliminary incl usion/exclusion criteria in the form of PICOTS, our KQs were posted for public comment on AHRQ 's Effective Health Care Web site from March 18, 2011, to April 15, 2011. We revised the KQs as needed based on review of the comments and discussion with a seven -member Technical Expert Panel (TEP), primarily for ensuring that the PICOTS aligned with the needs and understanding of the topic by stakeholders in the field. The RTI -UNC EPC incorporated public comments and guidance from the TEP into a final research pr otocol, which was posted on the AHRQ Web site on November 15, 2011. Literature Search and Review Strategy We systematically searched, reviewed, and analyzed the scientific evidence for each KQ. We conducted focused searches of MED LINE\u00ae (via PubMed), Socia l Science s Citation Index\u00ae, PsycI NFO\u00ae, and the Cochrane Library. An experienced research librarian used a predefined list of search terms and medical subject headings. To ensure clinical relevancy, w e limited searches to publications from 1990 and later. W e also limited the search to studies published in English. We searched existing evidence- based registries and databases on interventions for children and maltreated children to identify relevant peer -reviewed articles that the systematic literature search may have missed. We also searched unpublished and grey literature relevant to the review. Methods for identifying grey literature included a review of trial registries, specifically ClinicalTrials.gov, Health Services Research Projects in Progress (www.nlm .nih.gov/hsrproj), and the European Union Clinical Trials Register (www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu). Further, AHRQ Population Children (ages 0- 14) exposed to maltreatment and their caregivers when applicableaInterventions Psychosocial Pharmacotherapy Adverse events(KQ 1, 2, 3, 4 ) (KQ 6 )Child well-being outcomes Mental and behavioral health Healthy caregiver-child relationship Healthy development School-based functioning Child welfare outcomes Safety Placement stability Time to permanency Treatment engagement(KQ 5) ES-5 requested Scientific Information Packets from the developers and distributors of the interventions identified in the literature review. Scientific Information Packets allow an opportunity for the intervention developers and distributors to provide the EPC with both published and unpublished data that they believe should be considered for the review. We included unpublished studies that met all i nclusion criteria and contained enough information on the research methods used for the risk of bias assessment. Last, we searched the reference lists of review articles pertinent to the review but that did not meet the criteria for inclusi on. Trained rev iewer pairs independently evaluated each of the titles and abstracts. For each article that either or both reviewers chose to include from the abstract review, two reviewers reviewed their full texts for eligibility against our PICOTS (Table A ) and study design eligibility criteria (i.e., systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case -control studies ; N > 10) . During full -text review, if both reviewers agreed that a study did not meet the eligibility criteria, the study was excluded. Reviewers resolved conflicts by discussion and consensus or by consulting a third member of the review team. Table A. Population, Intervention, Comparator, Timing, Setting (PICOTS) Domain Description Population Children aged 0 to 14 years exposed to child maltreatment. For this review, we used the definition of maltreatment provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:20 o Child abuse: words or overt actions t hat cause harm, potential harm, or threat of harm to a child o Child neglect: failure to provide for a child 's basic physical, emotional, or educational needs or to protect a child from harm or potential harm; privation (conditions of severe social deprivati on). Children aged 0 to 14 whose families were involved with child protective services, including children who remained in the care of their biological parent and those placed in out -of-home care (e.g., foster care, kinship care, group home care). We excluded studies that targeted children known to have been placed in out -of-home care because the child' s behavior or condition posed a threat to their community or was beyond the control of his or her family (e.g., youth referred or mandated by the juvenile justice system to out -of-home placement because of multiple criminal offenses; children placed in out -of-home care due to serious emotional disturbance and no involvement with the child protective services). The population included the child' s primary careg iver(s) when the intervention targeted the caregiving context. The primary caregiver was defined as the biological parent; foster, kinship (relative), or adoptive caregiver; or caregivers in a residential program or group home. Child subgroups were define d by age, type of maltreatment exposure, severity of maltreatment exposure, presence of child behavioral and mental health problems, and sociodemographic groups (race, ethnicity, and sex). Caregiver subgroups were defined as caregiving context (i.e., prim ary caregiver/environment), presence of caregiver substance abuse or other mental health disorder, caregiver sociodemographic characteristics (age, race, ethnicity, and sex). Interventions Clinical interventions designed to prevent, ameliorate, or improv e mental health symptoms, behavior problems, or psychopathology; optimize child development and functioning; and/or improve child welfare outcomes, including the following: Psychotherapy/psychosocial interventions delivered at the individual, caregiver, an d/or family level (including Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Parent -Child Interaction Therapy, Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch up, the Incredible Years ). General and specific types of pharmacotherapy (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhi bitors [SSRIs]). Strategies or approaches designed to improve the system of care for maltreated children and caregivers at the service-delivery or organizational level were excluded. Examples include intensive family preservation or reunification service m odels, solution- focused/based casework, differential response, and routine preservice foster parent training programs. ES-6 Table A . Population, Intervention, Comparator, Timing, Setting (PICOTS) (continued) Domain Description Comparator The comparison con dition as defined in the respective studies. Active controls were comparison groups that received another structured intervention. Inactive controls were comparison groups that did not receive another structured intervention Outcomes Child well -being out comes Child mental and behavioral health (e.g., prevention of or reduction in severity or number of traumatic stress symptoms or syndromes; post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); attachment disorders; depressive delinquent behavior ) Healthy caregiver relationship (e.g., secure attachment ; increased caregiver responsiv and sensitivity to the child; positive attitudes toward percept of the child and causal attributions about the child' s behavior , family functioning) Healthy development (e.g., cognitive, language, physical ) School -based functioning (e.g., grade retention, disciplinary referrals, attendance) Child welfare outcomes Safety (e.g., prevention of maltreatment recurrence or reduced number of subsequent involvements with child protective services ) Placement stability for children in out -of-home care Positive permanency outcomes for children in out-of-home care Treatment engagement and adherence Readiness or motivation to engage in an intervention Treatment completion Adverse events Retraumatization Caregiver distress Timing Short -term duration: postintervention (i.e., at treatment completion) to <6 months Long -term du ration: 6 months after treatment completion Setting Studies conducted in the United States or internationally Interventions provided in both specialty service delivery settings (e.g., outpatient and inpatient mental health care settings) and nonspecialty service delivery settings (e.g., schools, community -based providers, shelters, prison or diversion programs) Home -based and out -of-home care (e.g., foster or kin care, residential treatment, group settings) Risk of Bias Assessment of Individual Studies For each included study, we assessed the potential for selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, detection bias, confounding, and reporting bias (see Table A) . Teams of t wo independent reviewers rated the risk of bias for each study. Disagreements between the two reviewers were resolved by discussion and consensus or by consulting a third member of the team. Results of this assessment are encapsulated in a rating of low, medium, or high risk of bias. In general, a study with a low risk of bias has a strong design, measures outcomes appropriately, uses appropriate statistical and analytical methods, reports low attrition, and describes methods and outcomes clearly and precisely. Studies with a medium risk of bias are those that do not meet all crite ria required for low risk of bias but do not have flaws that are likely to cause major bias. Studies with a high risk of bias include those with at least one major weakness that has the potential to cause significant bias and undermine confidence in the validity of results. Examples of flaws leading to a high risk of bias rating include differences in groups at baseline, high overall attrition, or substantial differential attrition across study conditions. A high risk of bias rating was not assigned to a s tudy merely because critical information was not reported or unclear. 21 However, \"unclear \" methodology was taken into consideration in grading the strength ES-7 of evidence based on the study (described below). To maintain a focus on the best available evidence, studies with a high risk of bias are not included in the results . Data Synthesis We report results from direct comparisons of different interventions in the form of a qualitative synthesis . We did not conduct a quantitative meta -analysis because of issues related to heterogeneity, insufficient numbers of similar studies, and insufficiency or variation in outcome reporting . We report magnitude of effect data as provided by authors in the studies reviewed. We did not perform additional effect size calculations , with the exception of one study that provided the effect size without the significance level.22 Strength of Evidence Grading We g raded the strength of evidence f or child well -being outcomes ( KQ 1 ), child welfare outcomes characteristics ( ), subpopulations (KQ 4), and adverse events (KQ 5) on the basis of guidance established for the EPC program.23 This approach incorporates four key domains: risk of bias (including study design and aggregate quality), consistency, directness, and precision of the evidence. Two reviewers assessed each domain independently and also assigned an overall grade for each key outcome listed in the framework; they resolved any conflicts through consensus discussion. If a consensus was not met, the team brought in a third reviewer to settle the conflict. We used the strength of evidence grades defined by Owens and colleagues: 23 High \u2014High confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate\u2014 Moderate confidence that the eviden ce reflects the true effect. Further research may change our confidence in the estimate of the effect and may change the estimate. Low \u2014Low confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is likely to change our confidence in the est imate of the effect and is likely to change the estimate. Insufficient \u2014Evidence either is unavailable or does not permit estimation of an effect. Applicability We assessed the applicability of the evidence following guidance from Atkins and colleagues.24 We used the PICOTS framework to explore factors that affect or limit applicability. Results We provide a summary of results by key question. KQs 1 and 2 synthesize the evidence by type of intervention. KQ 3 synthesizes the evidence by inte rvention characteristics, and KQ 4 synthesizes the evidence for child and caregiver population subgroups. KQ 5 summarizes the evidence for the one trial that was identified addressing treatment engagement and retention. KQ 6 summarizes the evidence for the one trial that was identified that addressed adverse events . Detailed descriptions of included studies, key points, detailed synthesis, summary tables, and expanded strength of evidence tables that include the magnitude of effect can be found in the full report. Our summary of results tables below present the strength of evidence grades for each KQ . ES-8 Results of Literature Searches Figure B presents our literature search results. Literature searches through May 4, 2012, for the current report identified 6,282 unduplicated citations. We excluded 5,782 records at the title and abstract review stage. For the 497 articles reviewed at the full -text stage, we eliminated 428. A table of all excluded studies, organized by reason for exclusion, is provided in Appendi x C. The most common reasons for exclusion at the full text level were (1) the study included children outside of the target age range (0 to 14) without stratification by age or the study 's focus was on children at risk for abuse or neglect without known C PS involvement; (2) systems -level approaches (wrong intervention); or (3) lack of a comparison group (wrong comparison). After assessing risk of bias for all included studies (before data abstraction), we eliminated studies that we rated high risk of bias. This process left a total of 25 studies , reported in 53 articles with outcomes assessed as either medium or low risk of bias. Figure B. Disposition of articles (PRISMA figure ) . ES-9 Key Question 1. Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions for Improving Child Well -Being Outcomes The summary of results for KQ 1 is presented in Table B (see below) . We included a total of 21 trials (19 efficacy and 2 effectiveness trials25,26) that included 1 nonrandomized controlled trial.27 With the exception of one intervention, the body of evidence for interventions that addressed child well -being in maltreated children was predominantly low strength of evidence or was insufficient to draw conclusions . Low strength of evidence was largely attributable to most bodies of evidenc e consisting of only one trial , many with small sample sizes . We applied a moderate strength of evidence grade for mental and behavioral health and caregiver -child relationship outcomes for only one intervention, evaluated in an effectiveness trial: a brie f foster parent training program called Keeping Foster Parents Trained and Supported (KEEP).25 We found no eligible studies that assessed school -based functioning , an anomaly given the pervasive emphasis on school readiness and performance in the U.S. educational system . Key Question 2. Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions for Improving Child Welfare Outcomes The summary of results for KQ 2 is presented in Table B. We included a total of 9 trials in KQ 2: 4 large effectivene ss trials,26,28 -30 (including 2 large effectiveness trials29,30) 4 efficacy trials, and 1 nonconcurrent cohort study .22 With the exception of two interventions,29,30 the body of evidence for interventi ons that addressed child welfare outcomes was predominantly low strength of evidence or was insufficient to draw conclusions . We found moderate strength of evidence for two interventions: a home -visiting approach with maltreating parents (SafeCare)29 and the foster parent training program, KEEP.30 Only one intervention (Parent -Child Interaction Therapy combined with a motivational intervention) was assessed in more than one trial.28,31 Table B.

Note: Table is organized alphabetically by intervention name. For estimation of the magnitude of effect, we include only the statistically significant (p<0.05) effect sizes provided by study authors and do not calculate effect sizes as part of our an alysis . Interpretation of the effect size as small, medium, or large is defined as Cohen 's d = 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80; Cohen's h = 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80; and correlation coefficient r = 0.10, 0.30, and 0.50 , respectively .76 When authors use eta or partial eta squared effect sizes, w e use the interpretation that the authors provide.39,77 We include an effect size range when more than two effect sizes are reported. Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; G = group; NR = not reported; OR = odds ratio; PCIT = Parent -Child Interaction Therapy ; RRR = relative r isk reduction. Key Question 3. Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions With Different Characteristics We found no studies that compared the efficacy or effectiveness of interventions delivered in different settings. We also found no studies in which the design or methods clearly indicated that ES-12 modality (i.e., service delivery format) was a comparison of interest . Our team carefully avoided excessive interpretation to make a study \" fit\" with this KQ. Regarding theoretical orientation, meaningful contras ts were elusive. Our a priori focus on theoretical orientation was intended to identify studies with interventions that clearly ascribed to a particular orientation and not to elevate treatments with a unifying theory over multiply determined approaches. I t was difficult to infer a particular orientation and interpret results comparing eclectic approaches . Even when a treatment ascribed to a primary theory, rarely did an intervention adhere exclusively to that theory or related intervention strategies . Some \"borrow ed\" facets of various orientations; other s balanced one or more perspectives . Additionally, many studies did not fully describe the key components of their interventions, maki ng it difficult to know what actually occurred within treatment sessions and whether the therapist 's actions corresponded to the purported theory. Thus , we were able to identify three trials reported for which the driving theoretical orientation(s) were clearly differentiated or explained across the experimental and control conditions: Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch up was compared with a didactic, nonrelationship- based approach, 32-38 and Trauma -Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy48 was compared with psychodynamic child- centered treatment. Each trial showed benefit in favor of the experimental intervention. Key Question 4. Comparison of Intervention Effectiveness for Improving Child Well -Being or Child Welfare Outcomes in Population Subgroups Table C presents the summary of results for KQ 4. The results ar e a listing of interventions that showed low or moderate strength of evidence for KQ 1 or KQ 2 outcomes by subgroups. As noted earlier, our Key Questions specified other salient child and caregiver characteristics as subgroups to examine in KQ 4; however, we identified no eligible studies for these additional areas. A n umber of studies excluded parents with active substance abuse or mental illness and children with documented developmental disabilities. It was particularly notable that we could not identif y studies for inclusion in this KQ that attended to race or ethnicity, given the attention to racial and ethnic disparities in the child welfare arena.

Key Question 5. Comparative Effectiveness of Interven tions With Children Exposed to Maltreatment for Engaging Children and/or Caregivers in Treatment We identified one trial in the literature relevant to KQ 5 that assessed the comparative effectiveness of a motivational intervention designed to increase malt reating parents ' engage ment and retention in a dyadic parenting intervention ( Parent -Child I nteraction T herapy, ES-15 PCIT). PCIT combined with the motivational intervention yielded increased intervention engagement and retention relative to those assigned to re ceive PCIT with the standard CPS orientation. This finding pertaining to the impact of the motivational intervention on treatment engagement and retention was graded as having a moderate strength of evidence due to the size of the study and because it was an effectiveness trial. The PCIT -motivational intervention trial is notable both because of its strength of evidence and in light of the paucity of comparative research on treatment engagement and retention. Key Question 6. Adverse Events Associated With Interventions for Children Exposed to Maltreatment We included a KQ examining adverse events because there is the potential for harms, even temporary, associated with treatment of children exposed to maltreatment. Such harms ma y take the form of retraumatization associated with gradual exposure or caregiver distress resulting from an increased awareness of harm to a child exposed to abuse and neglect experiences. Only two trials reported an incident that the authors classified as an adverse event. Of those trials, only one reported active surveillance of adverse events, which was the inclusion criterion for KQ 6. This trial assessed the comparative efficacy of Trauma Focused -Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT ) and nondirective supportive therap y (active co sexually -abused preschoolers. Fewer children in TF -CBT experienced the adverse event of removal from treatment because of persistent sexually inappropriate behavior involving another child or adult (low SOE). Discussion Key Findings and Strength of Evidence Overall, the evidence from 24 trials (23 randomized and 1 nonrandomized controlled trial) and one cohort study (reported in 53 articles) included in this CER provides preliminary support for a number of promising approaches for addressing chil d exposure to maltreatment. Approaches varied in treatment target, intensity, modality, and theoretical conceptualizations of therapeutic change. With the exception of two interventions, KEEP and SafeCare, the body of evidence for interventions that addres sed child well -being or child welfare outcomes in maltreated children was predominantly low strength of evidence or was insufficient to draw firm conclusions. Our review illuminates major substantive and methodological gaps in the evidence and highlights critical areas for future research. To be fair, these gaps reflect the relatively new field of evidence -based mental health treatment provided in the context of the myriad and complex challenges of caring for maltreated children, engaging and retaining mal treating parents in treatment, and working within the parameters of the child welfare arena. Head -to-head studies are scarce, as are multiple or independent (i.e., tested by researchers unaffiliated with intervention developers) trials. Sample sizes are commonly very small. A major gap in the literature with implications for widespread implementation is the issue of \" dose\" or how much of an intervention is needed to affect change. None of the included studies addressed this issue. With the exception of studies involving younger children, few interventions were designed for or studied efficacy or effectiveness within specific age or developmental ranges. Similarly, studies rarely took into consideration or elucidated findings as they related to maltreatment t ype, severity, chronicity, timing, and exposure to other traumatic experiences. Also underrepresented in the literature were studies about interventions that explicitly evaluated efficacy or ES-16 effectiveness with the most vulnerable and challenging -to-serve f amilies; that is, maltreated children whose parents were struggling with issues such as substance abuse, domestic violence, and mental illness. For feasibility issues, such families were commonly excluded from a study sample. Implications for Clinical Pra ctice For clinicians, the stringent criteria of this CER may raise questions about its applicability for typical practice settings such as community mental health agencies, health centers, schools, and private practices. Although there has been a groundswe ll of support for using evidence -based treatments, they are relatively new models that often are unfamiliar to a community practitioner. Clinicians may have relatively few intervention options meeting the criteria for greater strength of evidence described in this report. Even so, the findings presented here may encourage clinicians to consider the relative evidence for one or another approach in a given clinical context and in their treatment decisions. The interventions highlighted as benefiting mental and behavioral health, caregiver child relationships, child development, and child welfare status represent treatment selection priorities. Studies that were included yet found to have lesser scientific support may be second- line options or represent best av ailable options for given predisposing maltreatment events or certain clinical presentations. We recognize that providers may turn to other interventions. The selection criteria in this review may still guide that process. Clinicians may consider the exten t to which their clientele are reflected in studies of a particular intervention (i.e., sample representativeness), the relevance of study outcomes (i.e., applicability), and the extent to which they are able to adopt a practice with strong attention to fi delity. In light of the limited evidence base for efficacious or effective interventions, this report may also heighten attention in the field to adoption and effective implementation of a new practice; successful implementation depends on clinical trainin g that is supported by adherence to a clear treatment manual, ongoing consultation in model application to clinical practice, and practice that is guided by an expert provider and trainer. 78 Outcome findings in this review may assist clinicians to fine -tune outcomes to be expected from a particular approach, modality, or level of care. On the basis of this refined knowledge, expectations may be communicated to clients to facilitate engagement and positive, realistic expectations for change. These implications are steps toward improving the relevance of research to therapists and other providers, which is critical if standards of care are to improve rather than remain static. Implications for Policy This rep ort presents highly specific research that may not correspond readily to practices in real-world community settings. The two approaches for which there was strongest evidence based on effectiveness studies25,29,30 were each tested in only one trial, and the SOE for most interventions included in this review was low. Given the early stage of research in the field, we caution that this report should not be taken as a guide to the selection of specific approaches for wider dissemination. Rather, the central finding of this review for policymakers and payers is the relative scarcity o f evidence to guide the field in meeting the needs of this vulnerable population of children. Two implications for policymakers are immediately evident. First, there is an urgent need for collaborative clinical trials to move the field of child maltreatment intervention research forward. A multisite clinical research network is a powerful platform that could efficiently furnish ES-17 collaborative studies of sufficient quality and size to build a stronger evidence base for effective practice. The National Child Traumatic Stress Network offers an existing infrastructure that could be expanded to support and provide scientific leadership for collabor ative multisite trials. Alternatively, or in addition, an existing clinical research network could be expanded or a new network formed to focus on child maltreatment intervention. Such initiatives will, in many respects, require a paradigm shift in funding to prioritize and adequately support complex research endeavors over single- site, small studies conducted by treatment developers or single research groups. It will also require a recalibration of timeframe expectations for study implementation with vulne rable populations and the creation of flexible funding mechanisms that seamlessly support the trajectory from efficacy to translation for rigorously examined interventions that show consistent, robust effects. A second area where policymakers can have a m ajor positive impact is in incentivizing higher quality program and administrative data that will both serve research needs and drive data- informed decision- making at the program and clinical levels. Program -record databases typically collect the minimal information pertinent to billing or other administrative needs and not necessarily case- outcome data. Field agencies that must compete for limited do llars to support their programs are rarely able to focus on systematic data or participate readily in rigoro us research activities. The collection of implementation and outcome data is rarely incentivized within an agency or practice or in the form of enhanced payment rates from insurers. The end result, in a context of dwindling resources to support the cost of providing quality care, is disincentive for programs to engage in activity beyond what is specifically reimbursed. Applicability The evidence base primarily reflects two related contingents of maltreated children: those for whom child welfare involvement or custody represents a proxy for maltreatment, and those for whom maltreatment is concluded through clinical assessment. Each of the two approaches is subject to false negative conclusions, but at a broad level they together reflect the target population of children exposed to maltreatment. Among the studies evaluating parenting interventions with maltreating parents, exclusion criteria may have affected the applicability of the findings in important ways. These exclusion criteria encompass parents unwilling to participate in the intervention and study, those with active substance use or abuse, those with psychiatric impairment (e.g., severe depression, psychosis) , and those affected by a cognitive or neurological disability. Because these population chara cteristics represent baseline risks that are prevalent in the target population, 79 particularly maternal depression,80,81 the applicability of the evidence to the complex presentations encountered in clinical se ttings is somewhat limited. The evidence base reflects the diverse range of interv ention approaches in the field, which vary considerably in intensity. Those interventions with lower intensity ( <12 weekly sessions or approximately 3 months in duration) or moderate intensity (13 to 24 weekly sessions or approximately 6 months in duration) may fit well with the structural needs and expectations encountered in child welfare systems operating under the strict timeline set for permanency planning under the Adop tion and Safe Families Act. 82 Most studies delivered the intervention of intere st under conditions more favorable than encountered in community settings. The discrepancy appeared most salient in terms of provider qualifications, as those in the experimental conditions tended to receive specialized training and close supervision from a highly specialized clinician , often the intervention developer . ES-18 More than half of the comparisons in the evidence base evaluated the efficacy or effectiveness of the intervention against an active control. Of these, 36 percent represented conventional practices in the field , and 64 percent represented derivations of other approaches.The derived approaches made assessment of applicability difficult because it was not clear whether they reflected the best alternative treatments in the field. On the contrar y, in several cases the comparator was a modified version of an original model for which evidence of effectiveness exists in the scientific literature or did not appear to maintain core components of the original model with fidelity (the case in five trials ). 32-38,41,42,46 The derived approaches also included two that were developed to control for nonspecific aspects of the experimental intervention. As newly developed interventions, the extent to which each represe nted a \" best\" alternative treatment could not be determined. The child welfare outcomes reported in the included studies were based on data drawn primarily from child welfare agency records . This approach may offer important insights into the integration o f treatment into child welfare systems but only to the extent that records objectively, accurately, and consistently report the relevant variables within a system and across regions and states. The duration of followup to assess maltreatment recurrence (i. e., safety) was variable across studies, making it somewhat difficult to apply the findings to the already complex recurrence data in the State Child and Family Service Reviews (the data used by the Federal government to monitor State child welfare program s in meeting safety, permanency, and family and child well -being outcomes). Research Gaps We identified a number of important gaps in the evidence for the CER. At a broad level, studies rarely distinguished themselves as either efficacy or effectiveness trials. Power analyses were seldom presented; this finding speaks to a serious issue in the field that contributes to variability in definitions of evidence -based practice and understanding of when practices are ready for dissemination. 83 At the level of intervention, studies infrequently undertook head -to- head comparisons with named active treatments ; also , studies that used a usual care comparator varied widely in the definition and content of usual care. Overall, t he active control treatments varied widely within and across studies and often lacked a clear treatment rationale and specificity about procedures. Such variations, particularly when unlabeled and untested for efficacy, make it difficult to arrive at conclusions regarding comparative effectiveness. Regarding \" usual care\" or \"services as usual \" as the control intervention, which was the case for the majority of studies reviewed, no standard exists for this type of control group in the field. Thus, usual care as the control represented a problematic comparator insofar as it is an ill -defined concept. Also, the definition of maltreatment presented a major challenge. Many of the included studies define maltreatment in terms of a child 's involvement with CPS or substantiation of alleged abuse. However, identification of child symptomatology was inconsistent across studies. Typically, an intervention was based on an event (maltreatment or involvement with CPS), rather than symptomatic or functional impairment. Add itionally, st udies were often vague about their own inclusion cr iteria, which influenced our decision to restrict the review to children who had a reasonably clear history of maltreatment and to exclude at -risk or mixed populations that posed further defin itional challenges. We did not encounter any study that stratified findings by child ren at risk or with known exposure . Many studies did not provide specific information about the type and number of events , timing, chronicity , context of children' s maltrea tment, or any co - ES-19 occurrence of other potentially traumatic events . We recognize that CPS records and clinical assessment protocols are subject to inaccuracy, misidentification, and omission errors; both are only as accurate as the information that has obse rved, reported, or inferred. Many studies exceeded our criteria for risk of attrition bias : total study attrition above 30 percent or differential attrition between the active treatment and control groups greater than 15 percent .84 We excluded several trials that admirably followed participants over a longer period (e.g., greater than 1 year) because too many of the participants were missing from the analysis of followup data. 85-90 In some cases, we excluded outcomes or studies that reported only relevant outcomes assessed using measures without well -established reliability and validity . We required that outcome measures offer more than face or construct validity . Although many studies compared baseline characteristics across study conditions, subgroup analyses to examine differential impact of the intervention were rare (e.g., by exposure type, symptom patterns and levels, severity of maltreatment , and family characteristics) . Moreover, the majority of studies we reviewed failed to provide sufficient attention to differences in children 's cognitive, social -emotional, and language development. Additionally, small samples precluded subgroup analyses and ex amination of moderating and mediating effects. As a result, we found limited evidence to assess treatment effectiveness or issues that affected treatment response by age group. Future Research Needs The myriad methodological, conceptual, and operational c hallenges to clinical research with maltreated children cannot be overcome by individual, site -specific, time -limited studies largely conducted by the developers of interventions or single research teams. To move the science forward, there clearly is a need for extensive multisite collaboration. A research network, for example, would provide the platform for efficient and methodologically rigorous collaborative clinical trials. It would allow for large enough samples to examine moderators of treatment respo nse and to investigate subgroups for whom treatments are less, or more, efficacious or effective. 91,92 A clinical research network could be an extension of an existing structure, such as the National Child Traumatic Stress Network. A multisite collaborativ e would provide a powerful nexus for shared strategies and best practices that result in successful implementation of controlled research studies with vulnerable families. Specific areas for focus in future research are listed below. Head -to-Head Trials . Additional comparative efficacy and effectiveness trials, comparing interventions with best alternative approaches, are needed to build the evidence for interventions with low strength of evidence. When studies inc lude multiple conditions, reporting of one -to-one (pairwise ) comparisons is critical . 93,94 Intervention Considerations. Rigorous research is needed to test adaptations of existing interventions, for which there is an established evidence base of efficacy or effectiveness, with new populations and in new settings or contexts. Adaptations may exclude or substantially modify components of an original version resulting in fundamental changes relative to the original in tervention. Thus, research on adaptations demands particularly close attention on the part of the researcher to therapist - and participant -level characteristics, as well as other factors (e.g., setting, timing). The paucity of relevant contrasts for KQ 3 suggest s a need for a qualitative ES-20 analysis of the literature to identify treatment characteristics that are relevant to and useful for the field. In the course of our review, we noted the distinction between and unequal attention paid to specific techniques (e.g., intervention- specific strategies and content) in relation to factors that may be common across interventions, at the level of client -therapist interactions (e.g., therapeutic relationship, personal characteristics of therapist and patient , engageme nt). The latter may be essential to understanding treatment efficacy or effectiveness and merits further attention.95-97 Assessment of Clinical Need . The use of common and validated measures for identifying sympt omatology to define clinical need is a major omission undermining the strength of the evidence base. Greater coalescence around such measures will help future reviews generalize findings across studies and settings and help achieve consensus in the field a round effective and ineffective interventions. Additional research is particularly needed to determine the relative benefits of various interventions across age subgroups . Outcomes . Future research should pay heightened attention to the consistent use of measures with well- established validity, particularly assessment of improvement in the caregiver -child relationship. Assessment of longer -term outcomes is also scarce in the existing literature; future research should assess the duration of symptom remissi on or functional improvement, generalization of outcomes from one setting to another, outcome variability according to clinically heterogeneous subgroups, and subsequent retraumatization . Among child welfare outcomes, permanency warrants improved measurement. Currently, outcomes generally reflect study constraints rather than the desired outcome of a constant, stable relationship with a parent or caregiver who comes to love and accept responsibility for a maltreated child. Research on Engagement /Retention . We were able to find only one comparative study for inclusion in this review relevant to the issue of engagement and retention. Future research could compare interventions in terms of retention or examine features of interventions associated with engagem ent and retention. Study Design and Reporting . Researchers should review and use the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) statement to ensure the greatest clarity in reporting of trials. 98 Future studies need to be adequately powered and statistical power calculations presented. Trials in this field do not typically blind participants or providers, but future studies should make every effort to blind outcome assessors to redu ce the risk of detection bias. Statistical Considerations . Even with concerns about limited sample sizes and attrition, few studies in the literature included an intention to treat (ITT) analysis. ITT analysis may not be useful when di fferential attrition exists across study conditions, as was often the case for the maltreatment studies we reviewed. However, in cases where there is not high differential attrition, ITT analysis helps to avoid the error of incorrectly attributing effectiv eness to an intervention that actually may result from underlying differ ences in the final study groups . More consistent use and clear reporting of ITT analysis would enhance the interpretability and generalizability of study findings. Other concerns related to statistical analys es and inference s pertain t o the need to control for multiple comparisons and limit post -hoc analyses. Future studies should account for multiple comparisons and clearly state planned statistical analyses. In ES-21 complex multifactorial interventions, planned statistical analyses should include the assessment of mediators and moderators. Beyond these particular statistical issues, a more fundamental question that merits increased attention in future research is how scientists should appr oach probabilistic estimates of effects and how to express confidence in their findings. Across the scientific literature we reviewed, researchers used only a classical/frequentist approach to hypothesis testing that views probability as the likelihood of a given result 's being true or false; a null hypothesis is rejected or accepted with a certain probability of an accurate conclusion or \" true effect. \" Relying on p- values to assess whether a research finding is true may be subject to inherent error associated with small sample sizes and extensive heterogeneity of design, definitions, and outcomes, among other considerations. 99 Hence, the use of alternate statistical analyses, namely Baye sian methods, may be warranted in future research because of the complexity of the population and heterogeneity of clinical need. Implementation and Sustainability Research. Rigorous study of implementation and issues related to maintenance of an interven tion is needed. Fidelity to the intervention model was infrequently reported and sparse in detail in the current literature. Research on lower intensity interventions and factors that affect accessibility for this vulnerable population is particularly need ed, along with increased attention to \" dose\" or how much of an intervention is needed to effect change. Because most mental health care is based on service reimbursement, future research should take into account the interplay of treatment model and structure, service definitions, utilization management, treatment authorization, and claims submission and authorization. Conclusions Maltreatment intervention research , particularly comparative research, remains a relatively nascent field. Much of the research r elies on relatively small samples and has limited statistical power, so data cannot be stratified according to subgroups or considered in terms of potential mediators and moderators of effect (e.g., age, type and chronicity of maltreatment). It is importan t to note that low or insufficient strength of evidence is not equivalent to a judgment of an intervention as ineffective. Rather it reflects the justifiable state of affairs where many promising or widely used approaches have not been the subjects of empi rical study with maltreated children . This review draws attention to the herculean efforts involved in conducting high-quality trials of mental health and psychosocial interventions, a challenge that is potentiated with the vulnerable, maltreated population that is the focus of this review. Although several interventions emerged with evidence to support their comparative efficacy or effectiveness, the strength of the evidence was low for the vast majority of outcomes. Consequently, our main finding was tha t the literature in this field is strikingly limited due to numerous substantive and methodological gaps. These limitations include (a) the predominance of single trials conducted by the treatment developers testing unique interventions that often employ s trategies very similar to those of other approaches, (b) usual care or wait -list controls rather than head -to-head comparisons, (c) short -term outcomes, (d) inadequate reporting of attrition, and (e) wide heterogeneity in type and psychometric soundness of outcome measurement across studies. Thus, this review serves as an urgent call for improving and building the evidence base for interventions to promote the well -being of maltreated children. A multisite research network is a ES-22 powerful platform that could facilitate the conduct of large, methodologically rigorous comparative efficacy and effectiveness trials needed to move the field forward. More broadly, a paradigm shift is required on the part of researchers and funders alike to galvanize the commitment and resources necessary for conducting collaborative clinical trials with these particularly vulnerable children and families.

PMID: ISI:000231676900008. 1 Introduction Background Exposure to abuse and/or neglect in childhood has serious adverse consequences across the lifespan, including increased risk of emotional and behavioral disturbances, delinquency, violent crime, and chronic disease.1-7 Because a primary caregiver (i.e., parent or other family member serving in this role) is the source of psychological harm, child maltreatment violates the child 's fundamental need for a sense of security, trust, and meaning in the world.8-12 As such, maltreatment represents severe disruption of the parent -child relationship, frequently enduring, that can cause prolonged high levels of stress that overwhelm the child' s capacity for effective coping .13-15 For children who are removed from the home and placed in out -of-home care, separation from and loss of the primary caregiver can exert its own toxic stress that compound the original insult of the abuse or neglect. The unrelenting chronic stress associated with severe and repeated maltreatment has been shown to trigger a cascade of maladaptive physiological and psychological responses, propelling the child along a trajectory of accumulating problems that can ultimately lead to the wide -ranging and persistent pathologies documented in the scientific literature. 9,13,16 -19 The current comparative effectiveness review (CER)20 on the topic of child malt reatment is the first in a two -part series focusing on interventions that address child exposure to maltreatment and other traumatic experiences. The second review in the series focuses on interventions with children exposed to traumatic events other than maltreatment or family violence; these include terrorism, community violence, war, school violence, natural disasters, medical trauma, and death of a loved one. Both reviews were carried out under the auspices of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qual ity's Effective Health Care Program, the goal of which is to improve the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of healthcare delivery 21 with rigorous and transparent systematic reviews. As such, this review was undertaken to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive review of the available comparative research in the field of child maltreatment. We acknowledge that the rigorous approach specified for a CER limited the range of interventions that could be included. In this regard, readers may be surprised to find that several approaches relevant to current practice in the trauma field are not represented. Thus, we advise readers to be cautious in drawing conclusions with regard to recommending specific approaches. Wh ile the review does illuminate the relative strength of evidence based on the comparative research that is presently available, its central purpose is to identify critical areas to address in future intervention research with maltreated children. The topic of child maltreatment necessitated its own review, separate from a consideration of other types of trauma, for two key reasons that pertain to clinical heterogeneity. First, maltreatment presents a different clinical scenario than other types of traumatic exposure, as the interpersonal nature of the traumatic experience can result in different clinical presentations, system responses (e.g., child protective services), and intervention approaches. The critical differentiating feature of maltreatment compare d with other traumatic exposures is the subversion of parenting and family as the source of protection and sanctuary. When the maltreating parent violates these fundamental assumptions, children' s sense of security and predictability may give way to terror and hopelessness. Second, children exposed to abuse and neglect are widely heterogeneous in terms of the caregiving context (e.g., maltreated children may live in foster care, in a residential setting, or at home with the offending biological parent), 2 type of maltreatment experienced, nature of the perpetrator (one or both parents, parent 's partner, relative, sibling), severity and nature of symptomatology, and prior and concurrent exposures to other traumatic or stressful conditions, particularly intimate partner (domestic) violence.22-25 We call the reader 's attention to the absence of domestic violence research in this review. As the topic for this CER was refined during the review process, the decision was made to include only studies that specifically target maltreatment, thus omitting studies with a broad focus on family violence or a specific focus on intimate partner or domestic violence. We recognize that exposure to maltreatment and exposure to domestic violence are related epidemiologically, 26 such that studies that address maltreatment will de facto include children exposed to domestic violence. Because of this co -occurrence, it can be difficult to determine whether out comes related to maltreatment and interpersonal violence involve a common or unique clinical pathway. The challenge is complicated further when recognizing that predisposition, prior experience and exposure, and environmental context and responses can repr esent both points of convergence and divergence. Our primary intent related to the narrowed scope was to limit, to the extent possible, clinical heterogeneity arising from maltreatment as directed toward the child and from domestic violence as directed tow ard another adult, where the child is a witness and sometimes ancillary victim. Definitions The term child maltreatment is defined variously in the scientific literature and across the many health and human services sectors that address the issue. For this review, we used two sources to define maltreatment: a report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) proposing uniform definitions for improved public health surveillance27 and language from the key federal legislation that sets the standards states must incorporate into their statutory definitions, the Child Abuse and Prevention Treatment Act (CAPTA; 42 U.S.C. \u00a75101, as amended by the CAPTA Reauthorization Act of 2010). 28 Thus, we define maltreatment as any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent (custodial and noncustodial parents) or other caregiver that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child; the harm to a child may or may not be the intended consequence. For this review, we also define neglect as privation or severe social depri vation, as can be the case in institutional care if the child does not have the opportunity to form a close relationship with a primary caregiver. However, moving from definition to identification in the area of child maltreatment presents a number of thorny challenges. There are two primary ways that children are identified as maltreated: (1) report to the child welfare system, or (2) screening and assessment by another child -serving system (e.g., pediatrics, mental health, schools). A report to Child Protective Services (CPS) may be screened out (i.e., no investigation is conducted), investigated without confirmation of maltreatment, or substantiated (i.e., evidence for maltreatment is strong). Yet even substantiation cannot serve as a sufficient index of maltreatment, as the definitions of maltreatment vary widely across US states and foreign nations. In instances of maltreatment not substantiated, sufficient indicators to affirm maltreatment are lacking yet its unequivocal absence cannot be proven. Moreo ver, many maltreated children, arguably a majority, are not reported to CPS. A subset of children not reported to CPS may be identified through other child- serving systems, which are also subject to false positive or false negative conclusions owing to var ied methods of screening and assessment (with varying degrees of reliability and validity), definitional criteria, and skill with which conclusions are drawn. Not surprisingly, these many factors affecting identification can result in confusion and inaccur acy for researchers, clinicians, 3 and policymakers, leading to inconsistency in the way maltreatment has been operationalized in the scientific literature. Incidence and Prevalence Child maltreatment is a global public health problem affecting high -, middl e-, and low - income countries. According to a recent report from the World Health Organization and the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, 6 international studies have reported high rates of child physical abuse (between 25% to 50% of all children, depending on the count ry). Global estimates of child sexual abuse are also high: 20 percent of women and 5 percent to 10 percent of men report experiencing sexual abuse during childhood. 6 Child welfare agencies in the high -income countries of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia report rates of maltreatment among subs tantiated cases ranging from 34 percent to 60 percent for neglect, 10 percent to 28 percent for physical abuse, and 7 percent to10 percent for sexual abuse.7 In the United States, a nationally representative survey on child exposure to violence conducted in 2008 found that more than 1 in 10 children (10.2%) had experienced some form of maltreatment (including physical abuse, psychological or emotional abuse, and child neglect) during the previous year. 29 Nearly 1 in 5 children (18.6%) had been exposed to maltreatment in their lifetimes.30 Important incidence and prevalence data for the United States are also available from investigated reports of maltreatment to state CPS agencies (Natio nal Child Abuse and Neglect Data System , NCANDS).31 However, a caveat about the accuracy of these data is warranted: it is generally understood that (a) minimum s tandards set by federal and state laws for defining abuse and neglect , and (b) misidentification of cases serve to greatly underestimate the true incidence.32 The most recent NCANDS data, for federal fiscal year 20 10, indicate that approximately 5.9 million children were involved in 3.3 million referrals to CPS; 2 million referral s were screened in and received a CPS response. Of the nearly 1.8 million reports that received an investigation, 436,321 were found to be substantiated, and 24,976 were found to be indicated (meaning that maltreatment was highly likely despite insufficient evidence to substantiate). 31 Among substa ntiated cases, the most prevalent type of maltreatment was neglect (78.3%) followed by physical abuse (17.6%). Approximately 9 percent of victims experienced sexual abuse and 8 percent suffered psychological maltreatment. 31 Infants less than 1 year of age had the highest rate of victimization at 20.6 per 1,000 children. Approximately 34 percent of victimized children were infants and toddlers (0 to 3 years of age); 23.4 percent were 4 to 7 years of age, 18.7 p ercent were 8 to 11 years of age, and 17.3 percent were 12 to 15 years of age. Victimization was split almost evenly between the sexes, regardless of age group. More than one-third (37.2%) experienced victimization by their mother acting alone, 19.1 percent were maltreated by their father acting alone, and nearly 18.5 percent were maltreated by both parents. 31 Regarding race and ethnicity, the majority of children with substantiated maltreatment in 2010 were Caucasian (44.8%), followed by African American (21.9%), and Hispanic (21.4%).31 African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, and children of multiple raci al descent had the highest victimization rates (14.6, 11.0, and 12.7 per 1,000 children, respectively). African American children, in particular, are disproportionately represented in the child welfare system relative to their percentage in the general pop ulation (approximately 15%). Whether these figures represent actual higher rates of maltreatment among African American children or bias 4 resulting from systematic differential attention to them in CPS referrals, investigation, or service allocation is a ma tter of considerable debate in this field.33,34 Child maltreatment is multiply determined ; the numerous risk factors for child abuse and neglect cut across domains of parent/caregiver, family, child, and environment.6,35,36 At the caregiver level, a major risk factor is the parent 's own history of maltreatment as well as depression, substance abuse, negative ideations about the child, lack of or inaccurate knowledge of normative child development, harsh discipline practices, and being a young/adolescent parent. At the family level, risk factors include single parenting, stress, social isolation, marital conflict, and domestic violence and, at the environmental level, poverty and community violence. Several child attributes that put additional physical and emotional demands on the parent/caregiver are also recognized as risk factors, including young age of the child (younger than 3 years) and child physical, cognitive, and emotional disabilities. Experts generall y agree that the unhealed emotional wounds of childhood maltreatment can coalesce with other risk factors to carry maltreatment' s negative effects on parenting forward across generations, although rates and patterns of intergenerational maltreatment vary s ubstantially across studies. 37-42 Etiology A burgeoning knowledge base in psychobiological research is advancing our understanding of the toxic effects of prolonged, severe, and unpredictable stress on brain devel opment and child mental and behavioral outcomes. Exposure to toxic or traumatic stress in the form of maltreatment may alter the developing brain by sensitizing neural pathways and overdeveloping regions of the brain where fear and anxiety responses are activated. 43 One specific pathway of effect is dysregulation of the hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal axis. Specifically, chronic exposure to stressful and arousing events is associated with activat ion of this axis, which releases a cascade of steroid hormones, including the primary stress hormone cortisol. Excess cortisol production alters children' s baseline for arousal such that even nonthreatening environments stimulate a fear response. 44 Dysregulation of neurochemical regulatory processes is especially damaging in the early years of development when neurological structures are undergoing formation (see Gunnar et al., 2006 45 for a review). In the case of maltreated infants and young children, researchers have found that children in foster care exhibit atypical diurnal cortisol production patterns; 46 similarly, research with children exposed to severe social deprivation in institutional care prior to adoption have identified alterations in brain functioning including significantly reduced cortical activity and dysregulation of neuroendocrine systems. 47,48 Atypical cortisol production in adults has been found to be associated with conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, depression, and substance abuse. 47,49,50 Another critical source of toxic stress contributing to poor mental and behavioral outcomes in this vulnerable population is the experience of repeated disruption in care when children are removed from the home and placed in foster care. Although the majority of children reported to CPS remain living at home with their biological caregiver, 51 approximately 254,000 children in the United States enter foster care annually. F oster care is a component of the child welfare system that entails \" placement of a child in a substitute home environment when the child' s parents are unable or unwilling to provide appropriate care. It is intended to be a time -limited placement on the way to determining one of the following three permanency plan options: reunification with the biological parent, conversion of the foster home to a legally permanent guardianship or adoption, or placement of the child into another legally permanent family. \" 52,p.1404 Approximately 20 p ercent of children placed in out -of-home care are removed 5 from their homes because of risks other than maltreatment, per se, that threaten their safety (namely because of a substance- abusing parent, prenatal substance -exposure, or domestic violence). CAPTA allows states wide latitude in their definitions of maltreatment that allow them to make appropriate referrals and develop service plans for the \" safe care of the child, \" such that states may or may not define prenatal alcohol or drug exposure or parental substance abuse as a category of child abuse or neglect.28 That said, the vast majorit y of children are removed because of substantiated abuse or neglect.31 Approximately 30 percent of children whom CPS removes from the home are eventually reunified with their prior, often biological, primary caregiver.51,53 -55 However, these children are very likely to be removed from the home again. One study that examined re -entry rates in the Multistate Foster Care Data Archive, a longitudinal dataset representing 1.3 million foster children in 12 states, found that the majority (nearly 70%) of children reunified with their primary caregivers re -entered care within a year and that nearly 40 percent of these children were placed again within 90 days. 56,57 Another study using this same dataset examining re -entry rates among infants found that the 27 percent who w ere discharged from foster care eventually returned and that re -entry rates differed by placement type. Specifically, infants placed with relatives and then discharged to relatives were least likely to reenter foster care (11.9%) compared with children dis charged to their parent (28.5%) or placed with a traditional foster family (32%). 58 A typical child in foster care will experience slightly more than three placement changes over 3 years.54 Children with medical, deve lopmental, and mental health problems are especially likely to be moved from placement to placement.59 This scenario of repeated separation from primary caregivers and the corollary loss of important attachment relationships aggravates the child 's sense of fear, isolation, and betrayal caused by the original insult of maltreatment. Particularly in the earliest years of life, attachment disruption as a result of repeated separations from and loss of important caregivers puts children at risk for socioemotional dysregulation and developmental problems. 60,61 Given the variability in children 's maltreatment exposure and experiences rel ated to foster care, it follows that mental and behavioral problems among abused and neglected children vary widely in type and severity of symptoms, which include traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, and behavioral problems. As described earlier, when m altreatment is chronic, cumulative, and prolonged, it may present as a form of complex trauma, a subset of psychological trauma, with potentially profound negative effects on fundamental developmental processes in childhood. 8 When children experience unpredictable detachment, neglect, violence, and repeated abandonment in the context of their early caregiving relationship, their sense of self, other, and self in relation to other becomes disturbed when, under normal conditions, it should be becoming consolidated. 8,14,18,62 The disruption of healthy attachment in turn impairs the child 's capacity for emotional regulation, empathy, and coping.14,15,60,61 These early impairments can lead to chronic dysregulation of affective experience, including mood disorders, as well as under - and overcontrolled behavior patterns.63 Yet most children experiencing complex trauma do not meet diagnostic criteria for post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in part because exposure to maltreatment and traumatic loss associated with separation from caregivers do not neces sarily meet the American Psychological Association 's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM -IV-TR) criteria for a traumatic event. Diagnosis of PTSD and other mental or behavioral disorders is particularly complicated for young children who, in the context of rapid development and maturation, seldom meet full standard or diagnostic criteria. Rather, they often exhibit symptom 6 clusters that can be characterized in terms of alternate diagnostic systems (e.g., 0 to 3 Diagnostic Classification64) that addres s developmentally specific clinical presentations that can be precursors to later poor outcomes throughout childhood and adolescence and into adulthood. Recently, a Developmental Trauma Disorders Task Force of the National Child Traumatic Stress Network ha s begun to conceptualize a new diagnosis, developmental trauma disorder, to address with greater precision the developmental, psychological, biological, and social factors that serve as both causes and outcomes of child maltreatment. 65 Although consensus is lacking on this emerging diagnosis, attention to children 's complex trauma histories in diagnostic assessment and effective treatment is a central topic in ch ildren 's clinical care.63,65 Disease Burden The National Survey on Child and Adolescent Well -Being (NSCAW) provides key indicators of child well -being among children investigated for maltreatment in the United States, tracking the extent of mental and behavioral health needs in this population over time.51,66 Among children who come in contact with CPS, 48 percent show signs of an emotional or behavioral problem and more than 30 percent of c hildren birth to 3 years have developmental delays. 67 However, only 25 percent of the NSCAW population receives any specialty intervention to address their developmental and other special needs.68,69 Data from the National Survey of Adoptive Parents (NSAP) finds that children adopted from foster care have similarly high morbidity rates including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (38%) and behavior and conduct problems (25%). 70 Research with international adoptees has found that children who experienced severe social deprivation in institutional care prior to adoption have more behavioral and social problems than internationa l adoptees without such preadoption adversity . 71 One study found that children adopted from countries where the conditions of large -group institutional care put children at risk for social deprivation (such as Romania) were 2 to 2.5 times more likely to experience disability, including impaired functioning due to emotional impairment, compared with children adopted domestically. 72 Child maltreatment also represents a significant economic burden to society, cutting across many different service sectors including child welfare, health care, special education, and criminal justice. A recent study provides estimates of the aggregate lifetime costs of fatal and nonfatal child maltreatment. In addition to child welfare, special education, and criminal justice costs, the authors factored both short - and long- term health care costs as well as lost productivity into their estimations. Using incidence data from 2008, the researchers estimated that the total lifetime costs (in 2010 dollars) of nonfatal child maltreatment for CPS -investigated cases (that is, substantiated cases of child maltreatment) are $122 billion ; in fatal cases, estimated costs (also based on CPS data) are $2 billion. 32 These estimates reflect approximately $25 billion in short - and long -term health c are costs, $84 billion in productivity losses, $4 billion in child welfare costs, $4 billion in criminal justice costs, and $5 billion in special education costs.32 Another dimension of societal cost burden is the impact on Medicaid, as children in foster care account for a disproportionate share of Medicaid expenditures relative to their proportion of Medicaid enrollment. Much of this disparity results from foster children' s disproportionate receipt of mental healt h services. Youth in foster care use Medicaid -reimbursed mental health services at a rate 8 to 15 times higher than other Medicaid- eligible youth. 73-76 7 Intervention Strategies Interventions represented in the liter ature that met our criteria for this review focus on the clinical needs of the child and/or the child- caregiver relationship to improve child well -being and positive child welfare outcomes. Relevant interventions include both psychosocial or pharmacological interventions; however, no eligible studies addressing pharmacotherapy were identified for inclusion. Although there are many interventions in the field that aim to improve the system of care for maltreated children and families, broadly defined service delivery strategies are not included in this review. These encompass an array of approaches such as differential response, respite care, case management procedures, financial support, subsidized guardianship, and court improvement strategies. We recognize system -level approaches are highly relevant to the child welfare system; however, their inclusion would have stretched the limits of the current review in terms of both scope and generalizability. This issue is addressed also in the Methods chapter when we describe the exclusion and inclusion criteria for studies included in this review. Intervention research with maltreated children is challenging due to the complexity of their clinical needs. As discussed earlier, maltreatment is seldom an isolated event but is cumulative and tends to co- occur with multiple traumatic exposures; given this clinical picture, maltreated children often present with multiple mental health issues. A subset of interventions included in this review comprise treatment components sp ecifically designed to address traumatic stress and other mental and behavioral health symptoms attributable to a particular exposure (e.g., sexual or physical abuse), although these interventions are commonly applied across a wide range of symptoms or sym ptom severity. However, the majority of intervention studies in this review target children based only on exposure rather than the presence, type, or degree of symptomatology. The interventions included in this review are diverse in theoretical basis, targ et (child, parent, parent and child, family), modality (e.g., individual, dyadic, group format), setting (clinic, community agency, and/or home), intervention strategies, intensity, and outcomes. Several interventions are adaptations of or derived from approaches designed for other populations. By adaptation, we refer to approaches that in their adaptation and/or augmentation maintain the integrity of the original intervention (i.e., with minor modifications to the curriculum or manual and/or supplemental c omponents). By derivation, we refer to approaches wherein the authors do not specify the degree to which the original model was implemented and/or the extent to which core components of the standard approach were modified. For this review, we categorized t he interventions as parenting, trauma -focused treatments that are predominantly child -focused, or enhanced foster care approaches. In the section that follows, we describe each of these intervention types and provide a table defining their key features. Parenting Interventions The majority of interventions eligible for inclusion in this review are parent- mediated approaches; that is, their primary aim is to modify parenting behavior and thereby improve child outcomes. Parenting interventions with maltreating parents target core caregiver - and/or family - level risk factors associated with child well -being including: increasing the caregiver 's attunement, sensitivity, and responsiveness to the child' s needs; improving negative attitudes toward the child and/or the role of parenting; teaching positive discipline techniques to use in managing challenging behavior instead of corporal punishment; improving family functioning; 8 and/or addressing safety risks in the home. Parenting interventions with maltreating families also commonly focus on reducing the parent's stress and promoting the parent' s emotional well- being. Interventions also commonly include a component of practical assistance (e.g., assistance with food insecurity or substandard housing) or support to am eliorate stressful circumstances for the family. When interventions are directed at the foster or kin caregiver, the focus is on increasing the caregiver 's understanding of the effects of abuse and neglect on children; empathy towards the child ; and capaci ty to provide nurturing, responsive, and developmentally appropriate care. Many parenting interventions with foster or kinship parents are directed at supporting the caregiver in effectively managing child behavioral problems and reducing the caregiver 's stress related to the behavioral challenges. The interrelated goals of these interventions are to improve child functioning, avoid a failed out-of-home placement which results in a negative placement change (e.g., the child being moved to a new foster care placement, a more restrictive environment such as psychiatric care or juvenile detention center, or child runaways), and expedite a positive permanent placement for the child. Treatment plans often include concurrent planning that simultaneously aims to su pport the child's relationship with the biological and foster caregiver in the interest of a positive exit from foster care and timely permanent placement (that is, either reunification with the biological parent or other relative or adoption).

Most of these interventions also include a caregiver-directed component in the form of sessions that occur either alone or jointly with the child. Trauma -focused treatments include trauma- specific treatment strategies such as assisting the child to develop a trauma narrative, cognitive reframing and coping skills related to the trauma, and gradual exposure and mastery of traumatic reminders.

Descriptions based on information provided by the authors in the included s tudies, the intervention Web sites (when available), and several registries of programs and practices.102-106 Scope and Key Questions Scope of T his Review This review provides a critical analysis and synthesis of t he comparative efficacy and effectiveness of interventions (psychosocial and pharmacological) for children ages birth to 14 years that address child well -being and/or promote positive child welfare outcomes (safety, placement stability, and permanency). Th e review also examines (1) how interventions with different characteristics (modality, theoretical orientation, setting) compare in improving child outcomes, (2) how interventions compare in terms of treatment engagement and retention, and (3) adverse even ts associated with the interventions reviewed. Our intention was to balance the concerns of real -world practice and policy while at the same time carefully limiting heterogeneity in the studies we reviewed so as to maximize the generalizability of the find ings. Several peer -reviewed systematic reviews have been conducted on interventions with maltreated children; however, the reviews available to date each represent only a cross -section or a subset of the outcome of interest covered in this comprehensive C ER. Examples include a meta -analysis of the effects of psychotherapy with sexually abused children and adolescents145 14 and a meta- analysis of p arent training programs to reduce parents ' risk of abusing a child.146 A Cochrane review is available on behavioral and cognitive behavioral training interventions with foster caregivers in the management of diffic ult behavior;147 another Cochrane review, in the protocol stage as of 2012, will assess the effectiveness of family therapy for improving outcomes for children who have experienced physical abuse and preventing recurrence of abuse. 148 A relevant systematic review is also available from the Social Care Institute for Excellence of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) examining the effectiveness of training and support for foster caregivers and other professionals on the physical and emotional health and well -being of children and adolescents in foster care in the United Kingdom. 149 In 2010, the Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE) in the U.S. Administration for Children and Families (ACF) made available the results of a systematic review examining the effectiveness of home visiting model s serving pregnant women or families with children from birth to age 5 years. 150 Although reduction in child maltreatment was an outcome doma in in the ACF/OPRE review, its focus on secondary prevention with at -risk families and narrow age range minimized the overlap with this review, because we target clinical interventions with children ages 0 to 14 years old already exposed to abuse or neglect or with known involvement with CPS . Other reviews with limited overlap because of their focus on preventive intervention include a recent systematic review by researchers at the World Health Organization 151 and by the Preventing Violence Across the Lifespan Research Network (PreVAi L).152,153 Additionally, several government and nonprofit organizations have developed highly regarded and widely used evi dence -based registries and informational resources in this field. These sources help guide clinical and other practitioners, funders, and policymakers in selecting and supporting effective interventions to mitigate risk and to address the mental and behavi oral health needs of children exposed to maltreatment. Examples include the National Child Traumatic Stress Network 's library of Empirically Supported Treatments and Promising Practices, 102 the National Registry of Evidence -based Programs and Practices (made available by the Substance Abuse and Men tal Health Services Administration) ,103 and the California Evidence -based Clearinghouse for Child Welfare.106 Other seminal resources include a report on evidence -based practices for child abuse treatment by the Chadwick Center on Children and Families154 and a set of guidelines for child physical and sexual abuse treatment from the Department of Justice.155 This review will further help clinicians and other decisionmakers by providing a next step in understanding effective treatme nts with a comprehensive, systematic review of the comparative benefits and harms of evidence- based intervention with children exposed to maltreatment. We used a population, intervention, comparators, outcomes, timing, and settings (PICOTS) framework to d efine these elements for the review (see Methods for a complete description of the PICOTS for this review). Specificity in defining each element in the PICOTS framework is a critical step in en suring that a systematic review yields generalizable findings. The chief concern in defining the PICOTS with high specificity is to address the problem of clinical heterogeneity or \"the variation in study population characteristics, coexisting conditions, cointerventions, and outcomes evaluated across studies included in a systematic review that may influence or modify the magnitude of the intervention measure of effect.\" 156,p.6,157 The complexity of maltreatment exposure presented particular challenges related to clinical heterogeneity for this review, and this problem ultimately necessitated limitations in scope. Thus, we focus on (1) children who represent a range of symptom expression or children for whom symptomatology is not reported; (2) diverse exposure experiences in t ype, severity, 15 developmental timing and chronicity, as well as children whose specific maltreatment experiences are not reported; and (3) different caregiving contexts (e.g., living at home with the biological parent who perpetrated the abuse or neglect or living in out -of-home care). Given these broad inclusion criteria, the EPC team imposed an age cutoff of 14 years so as to exclude from the population youth whose developmental capabilities and needs are distinct from those of younger children. Additional ly, due to concerns about heterogeneity, we elected to exclude intervention studies that focused on primary or secondary prevention (i.e., study populations that were not currently involved with child welfare or where the description of the study population was too vague to make a determination regarding maltreatment exposure). Defining and classifying relevant interventions for this review also presented major challenges because of their diversity. These include clinical treatments such as psychotherapy o r psychosocial approaches with the child, parent, and/or child- parent together and pharmacotherapy; training programs with biological or foster parents delivered through the child welfare system; and service delivery approaches or strategies at the system level to improve the quality of care for children and their caregivers and families. Through the literature review process , we determined that system - or service -delivery level approaches were qualitatively distinct from discrete clinical interventions in terms of the degree of specificity regarding core treatment components and their implementation and specificity about the population. Ultimately the EPC determined that including both clinical and system- or service -delivery level studies was beyond the sc ope of a single review. Need for Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions for Maltreated Children Currently no national guidelines inform the selection of interventions for improving child well-being and child welfare outcomes for children who have been exposed to maltreatment. Although numerous resources and evidence -based registries exist that caregivers, clinicians, policymakers, and other decisionmakers can turn to for guidance on selecting and supporting treatments for maltreated children, differences in the rating schemas and approaches across these resources can present conflicting information that is confusing for consumers. Because consumers may not be aware of all resources available in the field or of important differences across the available r esources, their decisions may not be fully informed. Absent clear guidance on efficacious or effective treatment interventions with this population, at least one controversial approach with the potential to cause serious harm has been publicized and disse minated. \" Holding\" or containment therapy is an alternative child mental health therapy intended to treat attachment disorders; it has resulted in at least six documented fatalities. 158 In 2006, the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children published a task force report critical of coercive practices in therapy promoted as forms of attachment therapy. 158 In April 2007, the Association for Treatment and Training in the Attachment of Children formally adopted a white paper stating its unequivocal opposition to the use of coercive practices in therapy, while advocating attunement, sensitivity, and reg ulation -focused techniques. 159 Key Questions 1. What is the comparative effectiveness of interventions with children exposed to maltreatment for promoting child well- being? Specifically: 16 a. Mental and behavioral health b. Healthy caregiver -child relationship (e.g., secure attachment; increased caregiver responsivity and sensitivity; positive parental attitudes toward childrearing; positive parental perceptions of the child and causal attributions about the child' s behavior; decreased negative parent -child interactions; increased family functioning) c. Heal thy development (e.g., cognitive, language, physical maturation) d. School -based functioning (e.g., grade retention, disciplinary referrals, attendance) 2. What is the comparative effectiveness of interventions with children exposed to maltreatment for pro moting child welfare outcomes? Specifically: a. Safety (i.e., prevention of maltreatment recurrence) b. Placement stability c. Permanency 3. Among the interventions under review, how do interventions with particular characteristics compare in improving chi ld outcomes. Intervention characteristics may include: a. Modality (i.e., individual, dyadic, group, family -based) b. Theoretical orientation (e.g., cognitive behavioral, psychodynamic) c. Type of setting (i.e., specialty or nonspecialty service -delivery s ettings) 4. How do interventions compare for improving child outcomes within population subgroups? Population subgroups comprise the following: a. Child subgroups i. Age and other sociodemographic subgroups (e.g., race, ethnicity, sex) ii. Type of maltrea tment exposure (e.g., neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse) iii. Severity of maltreatment exposure iv. Presence of mental or behavioral health problems (e.g., complex traumatic stress disorders, serious emotional disturbance) or other special needs (e.g., failure to thrive, prenatal substance exposure) b. Caregiver subgroups i. Primary caregiving context: biological parent; foster, kin (relative), or adoptive caregivers; residential program or group home) ii. Presence of mental health problems, substance abuse, or domestic violence iii. Sociodemographic groups (e.g., age, race, ethnicity, sex) 5. What is the comparative effectiveness of interventions with children exposed to maltreatment for engaging children and/or caregivers in treatment (e.g., treatme nt adherence, treatment withdrawal)? 6. What adverse events are associated with interventions for children exposed to maltreatment (e.g., retraumatization, caregiver distress)? Analytic Framework Figure 1 presents the analytical framework for this review. This framework is a conceptual model that guided the analyses for this CER; key questions (KQs) are noted as appropriate to the linkages in this model. 17 Figure 1. Analytic framework for comparative effectiveness of interventions for child maltreatment aPopulation may include the child 's primary caregiver(s) when the intervention targets the caregiving context. Abbreviation: KQ = key question The populations included in this review are children and young adolescents who have been exposed to maltreatment. C aregivers are also included in the population when the intervention targets the parent or includes a caregiver -directed component. KQ 1 assesses the effectiveness of the interventions reviewed in improving child outcomes, specifically mental and behavioral health and other aspects of healthy development such as physical, language , and cognitive development ; the quality of the caregiver -child relationship; and school -based functioning. KQ 2 assesses outcomes that are of specific interest to the child welfare system: safety (i.e., maltreatment recurrence), placement stability while in out- of-home care, and permanency (e.g., successful permanent placement; time to permanency). The efficacy of interventions in important population subgroups is compared in KQ 4, while differences in efficacy by intervention characteristics such as theoretical orientation and modality are reviewed in KQ 3. KQ 5 assesses the evidence on treatment adherence, and KQ 6 reviews the literature on adverse events associated with treatment. For the purpose of this review, caregiver -level outcomes (e.g., parenting attitudes, parenting practices, family functioning, and caregiver emotional well -being) are treated not as mediators of child outcomes but as indicators of the quality of the careg iver-child relationship outcome. We treat caregiver outcomes as such because the quality of the caregiver -child relationship is inherent to child well -being; 10 additionally, analyzing mediating and moderating results was beyond the scope of this CER. Organization of T his Report The remainder of this review describes our methods in detail, documents our results, and provides a discussion of our findings and recommendations for filling important research gaps. Appendixes provide details of the search strategy (Appendix A), forms used for review (Appendix B), studies excluded at the full -text review stage (Appendix C), risk of bias ratings (Appendix D), and comprehensive evidence tables (Appendix E). 18 Methods This review is funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Q uality (AHRQ) Effective Health Care (EHC) Program. In 2005, AHRQ created the EHC Program to improve the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of health care delivery.21 The target audience \"includes not only polic ymakers in government and private health plans but also clinicians, patients, and members of industry.\"21 This comparative effectiveness review (CER) assesses the effectiveness, including benefits and harms, of cli nical interventions for children exposed to child maltreatment. A team of researchers conducted this review using the methods described in AHRQ 's Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews .160 The team included three clinical psychologists, a family medicine physician, and developmental psychologist all specializing in child maltreatment, as well as several researchers with expertise in AHRQ CER methodology. Topic Nomination, Development, Refinement, and CER Protocol Through a public nomination process, a clinician in private practice express ed an interest in attunement parenting for foster and adopted children ages 5 to 12 years. The nominator cited current research indicating that childhood trauma led to a chronic state of stress, in turn increasing the potential for problem behaviors. During topic development and refinement, the RTI International -University of North Carolina Evidence -based Practice Center (EPC) followed the guiding principles for identifying and selecting topics established by the EHC program (these principles are described in detail elsewhere). 161 The EPC designed the systematic review using a PICOTS (population, interventions, comparators, outcomes, timing, and settings)162 framework and defined a set of key questions (KQs) a priori with input from a range of stakeholders (i.e., key informants). As originally nominated, the topic was particularly narrow in regard to the interventions (attunement parenting) and setting (foster and adoptive care). Following EHC guidance to explore nominated topics with an understanding of t he \"clinical logic underlying the rationale for a service, \" 163 and the nominator 's interest in trauma associated with child abuse and neglect as a potent risk factor for mental and behavioral health problems, the E PC expanded the population to include children exposed to maltreatment and, more broadly, all children involved in the child welfare system regardless of setting (i.e., foster care, adoptive care, or in the care of biological parents). Following refinement of the topic, AHRQ posted the proposed systematic review framework, including the PICOTS, KQ s, and analytic framework, on the EHC Web site from March 18, 2011 to April 15, 2011. After the CER framework posting, the EPC reviewed public comments and consul ted with a Technical Expert Panel to finalize the research protocol. Names of the members of Technical Expert Panel are listed at the front of this report. AHRQ posted the research protocol on the EHC Web site on November 15, 2011. Decisions based on clini cal heterogeneity 156 of the population, diversity of interventions, and the resulting scope of the review led to modifications of the protocol (posted January 10, 2012). 19 Literature Search Strategy Search Strategy We systematically searched, reviewed, and analyzed the scientific evidence for each KQ. We conducted focused searches of MEDINE (via PubMed), Social Science Citation Index (SSCI), PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Library. An experienced research librarian used a predefined list of search terms and medical subject headings (MeSH). The librarian completed the first search on September 29, 2011 and an update search on May 4, 2012. We limited searches to publications from 1990 and later to ensure clinical relevancy. We limited the search to studies published in English, based on limited resources. The complete search strategies, including specific limitations used for each database, are presented in Appendix A. To build on the work of the existing evidence -based registries and databases on interventions for children, we searched the following registries for relevant articles that the systematic literatur e search may have missed: National Child Traumatic Stress Network 's Empirically Supported Treatments and Promising Practices 102 California Evidence -based Clearinghouse for Child Welfare106 National Registry of Evidence -based Programs and Practices103 Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Model Programs Guide105 Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence Program Database.164 We searched unpublished and grey literature relevant to the review. Methods for identifying grey literature included a review of trial registries, specifically ClinicalTrials.gov, Health Services Research Projects in Progress (www.nlm.nih.gov/hsrproj), and the European Union Clinical Trials Register (www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu). Further, AHRQ requested scientific information packets from the developers and distributors of the interventions identified in the literature review. Scientific information packets provide an opportunity for the intervention developers and distributors to share with the EPC both published and unpublished data that they believe should be considered for the review. We included unpublished studies that met all inclusion criteria and contained enough information on the research methods used for the risk of bias assessment. Lastly, we searched reference lists of review articles that are pertinent but did not meet inclusion criteria for studies that we should consider for inclusion in this review. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Table 4 outlines the population, interventions , comparators, outcomes, timing, and settings (PICOTS) that define the major inclusion criteria for studies in this review. In the sections following the table, we discuss each domain. 20 Table 4. Population, Intervention, Comparator, Timing, Setting (PICOTS) Domain Description Population Children aged 0 to 14 years exposed to child maltreatment . For this review, we used the definition of maltreatment provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:27 o Child abuse: words or overt actions that cause harm, potential harm, or threat of harm to a child o Child neglect: failure to provide for a child 's basic physical, emotional, or educational needs or to protect a child from harm or potential harm; privation (conditions of severe social deprivation). Children aged 0 to 14 whose families were involved with child protective services , including children who remained in the care of their biological parent and those placed in out -of-home care (e.g., f oster care, kinship care, group home care). We excluded studies that target ed children known to have been placed in out -of-home care because the child' s behavior or condition posed a threat to their community or was beyond the control of his or her family (e.g., youth referred or mandated by the juvenile justice system to out -of-home placement because of multiple criminal offenses ; children placed in out -of-home care due to serious emotional disturbance and no involvement with the child protective services ). The population include d the child 's primary caregiver(s) when the intervention target ed the caregiving context. The primary caregiver was defined as the biological parent; foster, kinship (relative), or adoptive caregiver; or caregivers in a residential program or group home. Child subgroups were defined by age, type of maltreatment exposure, severity of maltreatment exposure, presence of child behavioral and mental health problems , and sociodemographic groups (race, ethnicity, and sex). Caregiver subgroups were defined as caregiving context (i.e., primary caregiver/environment ), presence of caregiver substance abuse or other mental health disorder, caregiver sociodemographic characteristics ( age, race, ethnicity, and sex ). Interventions Clinical inte rventions designed to prevent, ameliorate, or improve mental health symptoms, behavior problems, or psychopathology; optimize child development and functioning; and/or improve child welfare outcomes, including the following: Psychotherapy/psychosocial interventions delivered at the individual, caregiver, and/or family level (including Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Parent -Child Interaction Therapy , Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch Up, the Incredible Years). General and specific types of phar macotherapy (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). Strategies or approaches designed to improve the system of care for maltreated children and caregivers at the service-delivery or organizational level were excluded. Examples include intensive family preservation or reunification service models, solution- focused/based casework, differential response, and routine preservice foster parent training programs. Comparator The comparison condition as defined in the respective studies. Active controls were comparison groups that received another structured intervention. Inactive controls we re comparison groups that d id not receive another structured intervention. 21 Table 4. Population, Intervention, Comparator, Timing, Setting (PICOTS) (continued) Domain Description Outcomes Child well -being outcomes Child mental and behavioral health (e.g., prevention of or reduction in severity or number of traumatic stress symptoms or syndromes; post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); attachment disorders; de pressive symptoms; anxiety disruptive, aggressive, and delinquent behavior ) Healthy caregiver -child relationship (e.g., secure attachment ; increased caregiver responsiv sensitivity to the child; incr eased positive attitudes toward childrearing , perceptions of the child and causal attributions about the child' s behavior , family functioning) Healthy development (e.g., cognitive, language, physical ) School -based functioning (e.g., grade retention, discip linary referrals, attendance) Child welfare outcomes Safety (e.g., prevention of maltreatment recurrence or reduced number of subsequent involvements with child protective services ) Placement stability for children in out -of-home care Positive permanency outcomes for children in out-of-home care Treatment engagement and adherence Readiness or motivation to engage in an intervention Treatment completion Adverse events Retraumatization Caregiver distress Timing Short -term duration: postintervention (i.e., at treatment completion) to <6 months Long -term duration: 6 months after treatment completion Setting Studies conducted in the United States or internationally Interventions provided in both specialty service delivery settings (e.g., outpatient and inpatient mental health care settings) and nonspecialty service delivery settings (e.g., schools, community -based providers, shelters, prison or diversion programs) Home -based and out -of-home care (e.g., foster or kin care, residential treatment, group settings) Population The population of inte rest for this review was children ages 0 to 14 years exposed to maltreatment (using the definitions below), children of the same ages involved with the child welfare system (including foster care), and caregivers of maltreated children when they were the target of an intervention. We used the following definitions for child maltreatment and sexual abuse: Child maltreatment\u2014the definition provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention27 includes both chil d abuse (acts of commission: words or overt actions that cause harm, potential harm, or threat of harm to a child) and child neglect (acts of omission: failure to provide for a child' s basic physical, emotional, or educational needs or to protect a child f rom harm or potential harm). The harm to a child may or may not be the intended consequence. 27 Sexual abuse\u2014the definition provided by the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act28 is the employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of any child to engage in, or assist any other person to engage in, any sexually explicit conduct or simulation of such conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct; or the rape, and in cases of caretaker or interfamilial relationships, statutory rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual exploitation of children, or incest with children. 28 22 We excluded adolescents older than 14 years of age in the interest of reducing the clinical heterogeneity of the population for this review. This decision reflects attention to the developmental needs and capacities of older adolescents, which represents a markedly di stinct developmental period in physical, cognitive, emotional, and social capacities and challenges \u2014 including significant independence, the ascendancy of adolescent peers as a key reference group, and increasingly complex interpersonal relationships. The A merican Academy of Pediatrics ' Bright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents differentiates \" early adolescence\" (11 to 14 years) from \" middle adolescence\" (15 to 17 years). 165 Some studies included both children who met the inclusion criteria and those who did not; we call this a \" mixed \" study populat ion. Examples of mixed populations include study samples with too broad an age range (e.g., 0 to 18) and samples that included children with known maltreatment exposure combined with children for whom maltreatment exposure was unknown and who were receivin g intervention because of another type of traumatic exposure or the child' s challenging behavior. We recognize that children identified as maltreated and at risk for maltreatment can present similar clinical and risk profiles. 67,166,167 However, concerns about clinical heterogeneity of the study population and an interest in producing a report with results generalizable to a clearly defined population led us to exclude studies with a mixed population unless results were stratified in such a way that we could extrapolate findings for the population meeting inclusion criteria of this review. Of note, studies that did not report the age range of children were assumed to include children through age 17 and were therefore excluded. Interventions For KQs 1 to 4, and KQ 6, interventions of interest included those with the following aims: prevent, ameliorate, or improve mental health symptoms, behavior problems, or psychopathology; optimize child development and functioning; and/or improve child welfare outcomes. We did not include preventive interventions targeting pregnant women, first -time parents, or other parents with risk factors for child abuse or neglect. Clinical interventions included in this CER include both psychosocial and pharmacotherapy approaches delivered at the individual, child- caregiver (dyadic), and/or family level to address the mental and behavioral health needs of the child and/or the quality of the child- caregiver relationship in support of the child 's emotional well- being. Relevant psychosocial interventions include specifically defined treatment components and may also include supportive services such as crisis management and concrete assistance. Due to issues of scope and heterogeneity, strategies or approaches to improve the system of care for maltreated children and caregivers at the service- delivery or organizational level \u2014which were originally considered for inclusion in this review \u2014are excluded. Examples include: Child welfare systems case plann ing and/or management approaches such as differential response (i.e., an alternative assessment model offered by child protective services agencies to families reported for child abuse and neglect depending on the severity of the allegation), solution- focused casework, and investigative decision strategies . General categories of services provided to families by the child welfare system such as preservice foster parent training, financial support, respite care, and peer support groups . Policy -level intervent ions in the child welfare system such as subsidized guardianship. 23 Cross -systems/systems integration strategies such as interagency collaboration and enhanced case management procedures . Court improvement strategies such as accelerated case review, court teams, dependency or drug court court -appointed child advocates, and programs to increase family engagement in the dependency or drug court treatment plan. For studies involving populations with mental health symptoms, general and specific types of pharmaco therapy are relevant treatment approaches (e.g., selective serotonin -reuptake inhibitors). For KQ 5, we included interventions with the goal of increasing participant engagement to increase retention and patient adherence. Only interventions that have bee n studied comparatively with maltreated children and/or their caregivers are included in this review. I ntensive family preservation or reunification service models, such as Homebuilders \u00ae, were eligible for inclusion; however, studies examining these approa ches focused on families who received services regardless of child age and thus did not meet the age cut -off set. Several well -researched preventive interventions that are widely used in the field (e.g., Nurse Family Partnership, Early Head Start, and Pathways Triple P) and which may be relevant for preventing recurrence, were not included in this review because the intervention explicitly focuses on prevention with families at risk for poor child outcomes. Comparators All studies included in this CER had a t least two arms. We excluded studies that analyzed differences between three or more groups but did not report the results of pairwise comparisons. Acceptable comparisons included control groups such as usual care or a wait -list strategy. In addition to wait -list control or usual care, comparators included (a) approaches representative of conventional practice in the field (such as child- centered therapy, support groups, and family therapy), and (b) derivations of interventions (wherein the degree to whic h core components of the original model are implemented is unclear and/or core components are omitted or substantively modified). By derivation, we refer to approaches wherein the authors do not specify the degree to which the original model was implemente d and/or modify the core components. Lastly, we excluded studies comparing the same intervention in different contexts, such as with kin caregivers compared with non- kin caregiver because the study did not directly answer any of the KQs. Outcomes All child well -being outcomes that studies reported were assessed using measures for which psychometric data on reliability and validity (beyond face validity) are available in the extant literature. We did not include measures for which basic reliability properti es were reported by the author but no further validity data could be readily found in the extant literature. For psychometric information regarding trauma -specific measures, we consulted the National Child Traumatic Stress Network 's Measures Review Databas e. We present the list of included measures in Table 5. As noted in the Introduction, we treat parent -level variables as indicators of the healthy caregiver -child relationship outcome in KQ 1. In our results, we differentiate parent self-report outcomes such as attitudes towards corporal punishment, perceptions of child behavior, and parenting practices from direct and objective measures of the quality of the 24 caregiver -child relationship (observations of parent -child interaction and child attachment behavior).

For KQ 6, an adverse event is defined as a \" harmful or undesirable outc ome that occurs during or after the use of a drug or intervention but is not necessarily caused by it.\"168 We did not require a validated measure for assessment of adverse events; however, we did require active sur veillance of harms. Timing We included studies reporting short - or long- term outcomes as defined by the authors. We included end- of-intervention results as well as any follow -up data. Intermediate measures, that is, assessments made between baseline and co mpletion of the intervention, are not included in the report. Setting We did not exclude studies based on geography or the setting of service provision. Study Design s To identify appropriate study designs, the research team used the algorithm developed by the Alberta EPC .169 Table 6 describes the study design inclusion criteria developed for this report. All studies were considered efficacy studies unless the study authors clearly identified them as effectiveness trials that were intended to reflect \" real world \" conditions. 170 Table 6. Study i nclusion criteria Category Criteria for I nclusion Study design Systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, cohort studies (e.g. prospective and retrospective) , and case -control studies Sample size N10 Study location United States and international Clinics, community -based agencies, and home -based 26 Study Selection Two trained members of the research team independently reviewed all titles and abstracts identified through searches for eligibility against predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Abstracts marked for possible inclusion by either reviewer underwent a full -text review. Each full-text article was again independently reviewed by two trained members of the team to determine if it met inclusion criteria. If it did not meet inclusion criteria, each reviewer recorded the reason for exclusion ; reviewers resolved disagreement s by consensus discussion and consulted a third party if they were unable to reach a consensus. The full -text review form reviewers used is reproduced in Appendix B. If both reviewers agreed that a study did not meet the eligibility criteria, it was excluded. If the reviewers disagreed, they resolved conflicts by discussion and consensus or by consulting a third member of the review team. The project coordinator tracked results of the abstract and full -text reviews in an EndNote database. Appendix C contains a complete list of studies excluded during the full -text review, denoted by primary reason for exclusion. We screened unpublished studies identified through grey literature search and review ed scientific information packets using the same title/abstract and full- text review processes. Data Extraction A template for evidence tables to be used for data synthesis was d eveloped using the PICOTS framework. For studies that met inclusion criteria, we abstracted relevant information into these evidence tables using Microsoft Excel. We abstracted characteristics of study populations, interventions, comparators, settings, study designs, methods, and results. One trained reviewer abstracted the relevant data from each included article and a second member of the team reviewed each data abstraction against the original article for completeness and accuracy. Risk of Bias Assessme nt For each included study, we assessed the potential for selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, detection bias, and reporting bias (Table 7). Two independent reviewers rated the risk of bias for each study. Disagreements between the two reviewe rs were resolved by discussion and consensus or by consulting a third member of the team. Table 7. Risk of bias assessment questions Abbreviated Criteria in Table Full Question Type of Bias Assessed Similar at baseline Were groups similar at baseline? Selection bias Fidelity Were measures taken to ensure intervention fidelity? Performance bias Assessor blinded Were outcome assessors unaware of which intervention the participants received (i.e., blinded)? Detection bias All outcomes included Are al l prespecified outcomes reported in the results? Reporting bias Measures equally applied Were outcome measures equally applied? Detection bias Attrition reported Do study authors report either attrition statistic or that all participants who started th e study completed the study? Attrition bias Attrition 30% Was the overall attrition for the study 30%? Attrition bias Differential attrition 15% Was the differential attrition between groups 15%? Attrition bias 27 Table 7. Risk of bias assessment questions (continued) Abbreviated Criteria in Table Full Question Type of Bias Assessed QUESTIONS FOR RCTs ONLY Randomization adequate Was randomization adequate? Selection bias Allocation concealment Was the intervention/treatment allocation concealed? Selection bias ITT analysis Did investi gators use an intention -to-treat ( ITT) analysis? Attrition bias QUESTIONS FOR NONRANDOMIZED TRIALS AND OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES Prospective Is the study design prospective? Detection bias Same source population Were groups recruited from the same so urce population? Selection bias I/E criteria Were inclusion and exclusion criteria equally applied in both groups? Selection bias Control for difference Were differences between groups taken into account in the statistical analysis? Confounding Results of this assessment are summarized in a rating of low, medium, or high risk of bias. In general, a study with a low risk of bias has a strong design, measures outcomes appropriately, uses appropriate statistical and analytical methods, reports low attr ition, and reports methods and outcomes clearly and precisely. It should be noted that evaluative criteria such as blinded assessment and concealment are less applicable to child welfare outcomes based on administrative data. Studies with a medium risk of bias are those that do not meet all criteria required for low risk of bias but do not have flaws that are likely to cause major bias. Studies with a high risk of bias include those with at least one major weakness that has the potential to cause significan t bias and thus we cannot be confident in the validity of results. Examples of flaws leading to a high risk of bias rating include different application of inclusion/exclusion criteria between groups, substantial differences in groups at baseline, high ove rall attrition, or differential attrition across study conditions . A high risk of bias rating was not assigned to a study merely because critical information was not reported or unclear . 171 However, \"unclear \" methodology was taken into consideration in grading the strength of evidence based on the study (described later in this chapter). Of note, the most recent methods guidance calls for a designation of \"unclear risk of bias .\" Because a substantial amount of work on this project preceded this recommendation, however, we were unable to apply the unclear risk of bias rating to this evidence base. To maintain a focus on the best available evidence, we opted to exclude from the Results chapter of this CER studies with a high risk of bias . We list each study rated as high risk of bias along with the reason it was rated as such in Appendix D. Data Synthesis We analyzed the data qualitatively. Across studies, the populations, interventions, and outcome measures used were heterogeneous and did not lend themselves to a pooled analysis. The Results chapter of this review is organized by KQ. For each question we have two sections: key points and detailed synthesis. The key points section summ arizes the results for each outcome in the KQ; the detailed synthesis section describes the study results. In the detailed analysis section we report key features of the study and the results for each construct analyzed. Two tables accompany the study nar rative : one table outlining key study characteristics and a second summarizing the study results. The study characteristics table 28 provides the study design, sample size (at baseline), comparison groups, and risk of bias rating. The results table summarizes the within - and between -group differences in the construct measured over time or at the study endpoint. Data on magnitude of effect are also included in the results tables. We report magnitude of effect data provided by authors in the studies reviewed. We did not perform additional effect size calculations , except for one study that provided the effect size without the significance level. Given the complexity of our analyses, we adopted some conventions for presenting comparative data ( Table 8 ). Statistica lly significant within -group changes are indicated by a superscript \" +\"or \"\"; a \"+\" indicates improvement on the construct measured; a \" \" indicates a detriment. In addition, we designate nonsignificant results with \" ns.\" Significant between -group differences are indicated by a \"<\" or \">\" between group one (G1) and group two (G2 ). If a study found no between- group differences, we will say \" no differences between G1 and G2. \" Table 8. Intervention A versus usual care, results (sample table) First Author, Year Comparison Groups Mental Health Outcomes Jones et al., 2002 G1: Inter vention A G2: Usual care Changes in Overall Mental Health and Behavior (Child Behavior Checklist) No difference between G1+ and G2ns p=0.66 Changes in Depression (Children' s Depression Inventory) G1+>G2- p=0.04 Jones et al., 2003 G1: Intervention A G2: Usual care Changes in Traumatic Stress Symptoms (Trauma Symptoms Checklist for Children) G1>G2 p=NR (sig) change over time p >0.05; sig = significant; + = within -group improvement over time p0.05; - = within -group detriment over time p0.05 Table 8 shows that, in Jones et al., 2002, the overall mental health and behavior of participants in G1 improved significantly over time while members of G2 did not change significantly on these outcomes. The between -group differences in change over time were not significant ( p= 0.66) for this measure. On a measure of depression, G1 showed significant improvements while G2 showed a significant detriment. The between -group differences in change over time (G 1>G2) were significant for this measure ( p=0.04), favoring participants in G1. In Jones et al., 2003, children in G1 exhibited a significantly greater improvement in traumatic stress symptoms than children in G2 ( p=NR, within -group change not reported). Strength of the Body of Evidence We graded the SOE based on EPC guidance established for the AHRQ EHC Program, as detailed in a recent paper by Owens and colleagues.172 The EPC approach incorporates four key domains: risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision of the evidence. Risk of bias is determined according to the \"degree to which the included studies for a given outcome or comparison have a high likelihood of adequate protection against bias.\" It is graded as high, medium, or low. Consistency is the \" degree to which reported effect sizes from included studies appear to have the same direction of effect. \" It is graded as consistent or nonconsistent. Consistency cannot be assessed when a body of evidence has only a single study (unknown or not applicable). When a body of evidence includes both consistent and 29 inconsistent findings, the presence of one or more consistent findings will result in a \"consistent \" grade for the outcome of interest. Directness is determined based on \" whether the evidence links the interventions directly to health outcomes.\" It is graded direct or indirect. In this report, healthy caregiver -child relationship outcomes were predominantly indirect; many measures assessed outcomes indirectly related to the caregiver -child relationship (e.g., parent attitudes toward discipline; parent -related stress) rather than direct observations of parent -child interaction or child attachment behavior. When a body of evidence includes both indirect and direct measures, the presence of one or more direct measures will result in a \" direct \" grade. Lastly, precision is determined according to \" the degree of certainty surrounding an effect estimate .\" \"Precise \" indicates a clinically useful conclusion th at is statistically significant, and \"imprecise \" indicates that no conclusion can be drawn as to whether either treatment is superior or whether the treatments are equivalent. The overall grades for SOE , based on the scores for the above domains, are des cribed in Table 9 . Grades reflect the strength of the body of evidence to answer the KQs on the comparative effectiveness, efficacy, and harms of the interventions in this review. In general, bodies of evidence earning a grade of \" high\" include several stu dies with a low to medium risk of bias with consistent results directly answering the KQ with precision. A \" moderate \" SOE grade may result from fewer studies meeting the same criteria (i.e., low/medium risk of bias, direct evidence, consistent and precise results) and also evidence from large effectiveness trials, which leads to increased confidence in the SOE . When evidence supporting an intervention is sparse (2 or fewer studies) the body of evidence is graded as \"low.\" Table 9. Definitions of the grades of overall strength of evidence Grade Definition High High confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate Moderate confidence that the evidence reflec ts the true effect. Further research may change our confidence in the estimate of the effect and may change the estimate. Low Low confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is likely to change our confidence in the estimate of the effect and is likely to change the estimate. Insufficient Evidence either is unavailable or does not permit estimation of an effect. Source: Owens et al., 2010172 Lastly, some bodies of evidence do not permi t a conclusion because of inconsistent or imprecise results; these bodies of evidence are graded as \" insufficient .\" For example, in the case of nonsignificant findings, the precision of noninferiority (i.e., that the experimental treatment is not clinicall y worse than the active control) or equivalence (i.e., that the experimental treatment is clinically similar to the active control) can only be assessed if the study planned and analyzed the data using a prespecified noninferiority or equivalence margin of clinically significant difference with a sufficiently powered sample size to detect that difference. 173 If a study is not identified as an equivalence or noninferiority trial by the authors, or it is identified as a noninferiority or equivale nce trial but the quality or reporting does not permit clear interpretation of the precision of the findings (e.g., sample size calculations are not reported), the body of evidence for the outcome would be graded as insufficient. Two reviewers assessed each domain independently and also assigned an overall grade for each key outcome listed in the framework; they resolved any conflicts through consensus discussion. If a consensus was not met, the team brought in a third party to settle the conflict. In 30 the key points section we present the SOE for each comparison and overarching outcome (e.g., mental health and behavior) as defined by the KQ s. We then explain the SOE grade in the detailed synthesis and also provide a table summarizing the SOE grading. Applic ability We assessed the applicability both of individual studies and of the body of evidence.172 For individual studies, we examined conditions that may limit applicability based on the PICOTS structure. Examples o f characteristics examined include: Population Narrow eligibility criteria, or exclusion of patients with comorbidities . Large differences between the demographics of the study population and community patients. Intervention Intensity and delivery of i nterventions that may not be feasible for routine use . Highly selected intervention team or level of training/proficiency not widely available. Comparators Comparison group does not represent an available alternative treatment. Such conditions may be as sociated with heterogeneity of treatment effect and the ability to generalize the effectiveness of an intervention to use in everyday practice. We abstracted key characteristics of applicability into evidence tables. During data synthesis, we assessed the applicability of the body of evidence using the abstracted characteristics. KQ 4 includes a detailed analysis of intervention efficacy in population subgroups. Peer Review and Public Commentary Experts in children' s mental health, specifically psychosocial development, maltreatment exposure, and evidence -based interventions, were invited to provide external peer review of this CER. AHRQ and an associate editor also provided comments. The draft report was posted on the AHRQ Web site for 4 weeks to elicit public comment. We responded to all reviewer comments and noted any resulting revisions to the text in the \" Disposition of Comments Report.\" This report will be made available 3 months after the final CER is the posted on the AHRQ Web site. 31 Results Introduction This chapter presents the results of the literature searches, followed by results for each key question (KQ). KQ 1 presents evidence on mental and behavioral health, caregiver -child relationship, and developmental outcomes (no study addressed school functioning). KQ 2 presents evidence for outcomes relevant to the child welfare system: safety, placement stability, and permanency. KQ 3 (on intervention characteristics) and KQ 4 (on subgroups of the population) are cross -cutting questions that draw u pon available evidence from KQ 1 and KQ 2. KQ 5 presents evidence on how interventions compare on treatment engagement (that is, motivation or readiness to engage in an intervention and treatment adherence). KQ 6 presents evidence on harms. At the start o f each KQ section, we describe how the section is organized; however, all KQ sections include the following elements: Key points and the strength of evidence (SOE) grade for each outcome relevant to the KQ in question, referring to the specific constructs measured to which the evidence pertains . A detailed synthesis which briefly summarizes the results of each comparison and also provides: (a) a table describing the study characteristics of each trial, including the risk of bias rating (see Risk of Bias Assessment in the Methods chapter) ; (b) a results table presenting the between -group differences in changes and differences at study endpoint with benefit denoted using a greater sign ( \">\") and statistically significant within -group changes for each study den oted as improvement ( \"+\"), detriment ( \"\"), or nonsignificant change ( \"ns\") for studies that provided these data ; and (c) a table presenting the SOE by grading domain (risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision). A summary table presenting overall findings for each outcome relevant to the KQ in question. We order the results in the summary tables alphabetically. We report magnitude of effect data provided by authors in the studies reviewed. We did not perform additional effect size calculations with the exception of one study that provided effect sizes in the form of relative risk reduction without the significance level. 130 Effect sizes were not reported universally across all studies included in this review and confidence interval s and mean differences were rarely repor ted. Results of the Literature Searches The results of literature searches are presented in Figure 2. Our initial universe of articles (unduplicated) totaled 6,282; we excluded 5,782 at the title and abstract review stage. For the 497 articles reviewed at the full- text stage, we eliminated 4 28 for a variety of reasons. We recorded the reason for excluding full -text publications; Appendix C lists these, organized by reason for exclusion. The most common reasons for exclusion at the full -text level were (1) the study included children outside of the target age range (0 to 14) or the study 's focus was on children at risk for maltreatment based on sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., living in poverty, first -time parents) (wrong population), (2) systems - or service- delivery level approaches (wrong intervention), or (3) a lack of a comparison group (wrong comparison). After assessing risk of bias for 69 included articles (before data abstraction), we eliminated 16 articles including 32 outcomes that we rated hig h risk of bias. This left a total of 25 studies, reported in 53 articles, which included outcomes that were assessed as either medium or low risk of bias. The majority (N=23) of these studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) , one was a nonrandomize d controlled trial, and one was a nonconcurrent cohort study. Figure 2. Results of l iterature searches on interventions for c hild maltreatment Overall Description of Studies Population Populations targeted by the studies in this comparative evidence rev iew included children ranging from 0 to 14 years old who had been exposed to maltreatment or were involved with the child welfare system . Many of the studies empirically assess an intervention within a population subgroup. Population subgroups include chil dren in particular age groups (early childhood, 33 middle childhood, or early adolescence), children exposed to specific types of maltreatment (neglect, physical or sexual abuse), or children with trauma symptoms or other special health care needs. Caregiver subgroups were also particularly salient (i.e., trials that assessed interventions for the biological [ maltreating ] parent or targeting foster parents). Intervention We identified 2 0 unique interventions ( Table 10 ) that were assessed with the included population. We categorize d the interventions as parenting interventions (N= 9), trauma -focused treatments (N=6), or enhanced foster care interventions (N=5). One intervention was designed to promote treatment engagement and retention (N=1). Each of the interve ntions included in this review is described in Tables 1, 2, and 3 in the Introduction. Many of the interventions included components directed at the biological or foster parent, either with or without the child' s participation. In addition to the parenting interventions, 3 (57%) of the trauma -focused and 4 (80%) of the enhanced foster care interventions include a caregiver component. Only 3 interventions were solely child- focused. Table 10.

Abbrevi ation: KQ = key question 34 Comparator The most common comparator in the included studies was usual care (N=1 3 studies), followed by active (N=1 0 trials) and inactive (N= 4 trials) control groups. We categorized the active comparators as either interventions r epresentative of conventional practices in the field (family, child -centered, or supportive group therapy) (used in 3 trials), or derived approaches. The derived comparators were either (a) modified versions of an intervention model in which the degree of fidelity to the original model was not specified by the authors (used in 5 trials), or (b) developed by the study authors to control for nonspecific aspects of the experimental intervention (2 trials). Outcomes Of the unique outcome domains reported in KQ 1, the most commonly assessed was children 's mental and behavioral health (N=2 0 trials), followed by healthy caregiver -child relationship outcomes (N= 15 trials). Very few trials reported developmental outcomes such as cognitive or language development (N= 3 trials) and none reported on school -based functioning. Fewer trials reported child welfare (KQ2) outcomes. Five examined safety (i.e., maltreatment recurrence), four examined placement stability, and four examined permanency outcomes. Treatment engagemen t (KQ5) was the focus of only one trial, for one of the included interventions. Adverse events (KQ6) were sparsely reported, with active surveillance of harms described for only one trial. No new outcomes are reported in KQs 3 or 4 as these questions summ arize the evidence for KQs 1 and 2 by intervention characteristic (KQ 3) and population subgroup (KQ 4). Timing Most studies assessed outcomes immediately postintervention or shortly thereafter. Few studies assessed long -term outcomes. Setting The vast m ajority of the studies were conducted in the United States. Several studies were conducted in other high- income countries , specifically Canada (N=2) and the United Kingdom (N=1). Two studies were conducted in countries with substantial cultural differences compared with the United States , specifically Iran (N=1) and Romania (N=1). Key Question 1 . Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions for Improving Child Well -Being Outcomes Organization We organize key question (KQ) 1 by intervention type ( parenting, t rauma- focused, and enhanced foster care approaches), as described in Tables 1 through 3. We begin this section with a description of included studies and an accompanying table presenting the number of trials and articles investigating child welfare outcome s by intervention type. Next, for each subsection, we begin with an overview of key features of the evidence base for the intervention type and then present the findings for each intervention. Findings include very brief key points presenting the main find ings for KQ outcomes and the corresponding strength of evidence (SOE) grade. 35 Immediately following the key points is a detailed synthesis of the findings for each intervention, providing information about study characteristics, the specific results (including magnitude of effect, if provided by study authors), and the SOE by grading domain (risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision). Please refer to the Strength of Evidence Grading section in the Methods chapter for further detail about the SOE g rading criteria. Finally, we close each section with a summary table presenting overall findings for each outcome relevant to the KQ in question, organized alphabetically by intervention name. We remind the reader that benefit is denoted in the results ta bles using a greater ( \">\") sign (e.g., Group 1 > Group 2). Also, the results tables present within -group changes denoted as improvement ( \"+\"), detriment ( \"\"), or nonsignificant change ( \"ns\") for studies that provided these data. Parenting Interventions Description of Included Studies Table 11 presents the 10 trials (15 articles) evaluating parenting interventions included in KQ 1.77-83,85 -89,91,93,101 Table 11.

Below we provide an overview of the key features in the body of evidence for parenting interventions. All 1 0 trials were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two studies met the criteria for an effectiveness trial.91,93 Five trials targeted maltreating parents81-83,86 -88,93 One trial targeted the nonoffending mother of children undergoing fore nsic evaluation for sexual abuse.101 Three trials targeted foster parents.77-80,85,91 One trial was directed at foster and biological parents together.89 Five trials focused on early childhood.77-79,81 -83,85 -88 Six trials compared the experimental intervention with a usual care condition.86-89,91,93 One trial used a wait -list control group.80 Four trials employed active control group comparators that were derived approaches.77- 79,81 -83,85,87,88 Eight trials reported mental and behavioral health outcomes.77,78,8 0,82,83,86,89,91,93,101 Nine of 10 trials reported caregiver -child relationship outcomes.11-83,85 -89,91,93 36 o Seven trials reported on indirect indicators of the caregiver -child relationship (e.g., caregiver attitudes towards parenting; parenting practices, including the use of positive discipline; caregiver report of child attachment behavior; caregiver stress and emotional distress).80,86 -89,91,93,101 o Four trials reported on direct indicators (i.e., objective obser vational assessment) of parent interactional behavior or of child attachment behavior.79,81,86,87 One trial assessed developmental outcomes.85 No trials assessed school -based functioning outcomes. Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch Up We identified two RCTs, reported in 8 articles, comparing Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch Up (ABC), a low -intensity home -based relational intervention, with an active control. The comparator was a home -based intervention focused on children' s cognitive and linguistic development derived from the Abecedarian early intervention program.174,175 We also identified one RCT, reported in 1 article, comparing ABC with wait -list control ( Table 12 ). One trial targeted foster parents caring for infants and toddlers77-79,85 and the other targeted biological parents.81-83 The ABC trial with a wait- list control targeted foster parents c aring for children birth to 6 years .80 Table 12.

Abbreviations: ABC = Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch Up; CP S = Child Protective Services; G = group; N = number; RCT = randomized controlled trial. Key Points Mental and behavioral health : o Compared with an active control, children whose caregivers participated in ABC exhibited significantly more normative diurnal cortisol regulation (foster and biological parents) and less negative emotionality (biological parents); however, no 37 significant difference in efficacy was found for ABC for parent report of child behavioral problems (low SOE of benefit ).77,78,82,83 o Compared with a wait -list control, foster parents who participated in ABC reported significantly greater improvement in child internalizing and externalizing behavior (low SOE of benefit). 80 Healthy caregiver -child relationship: o Compared with an active control, children whose caregivers (foster or biological) participated in ABC exhibited significantly more positive attachment behaviors (low SOE of benefit). 79,81 o Compared with a wait -list control, foster parents who participated in ABC had greater improvement in parent attitudes and greater reductions in parent stress (low SOE of benefit). 80 Healt hy development : o Compared with an active control, children whose foster parents participated in ABC exhibited higher levels of cognitive functioning (low SOE of benefit). 85 Detailed Synthesis Table 13 presents the results for the two ABC trials; addition al study details are provided in the evidence tables (Appendix E) .77-79,85 An initial article reporting findings from the first trial, targeting foster parents, examined children 's diurnal production of cortisol and parent report of children 's problem behaviors (child age 3 months to approximately 3 years). The authors measured cortisol, as neuroendocrine dysregulation is one of the primary targets of ABC (the other is the caregiver -child attachment relationship). C ortisol is an indicator of neurobiological response to stress and serves as a proxy indicator of regulation and functioning of the hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis, itself activated by physical and psychological stressors. Children in the ABC group exhibited more normative cortisol regulation than children in the control condition, although the timing of assessment was not specified and baseline cortisol measures were not reported. No significant differences were found for parent report of children 's behavioral problems. A second article reporting findings from the trial with foster parents examined cortisol outcomes on a subset of children, age 15 to 24 months. 78 As in the previous article, children who participated in ABC exhibited more normative patterns of cortisol regulation compared with the control condition.78 The authors also examined changes in cortisol levels after a stressful separation -reunion procedure but found no significant differences for cortisol values in response to the stressful procedure by study arm. A third article79 reporting findings from this same trial examined parent reports of children 's attachmen t behavior. Foster parents who participated reported that children exhibited less avoidant attachment behavior compared with the active control; however, there were no significant differences in efficacy of the intervention on children 's secure attachment behavior. Finally, a fourth study examined cognitive development outcomes at age 4 to 6 years among children who had participated in the ABC intervention compared with the control group. This study found that children in the ABC condition exhibited significantly greater cognitive flexibility and theory of mind skills compared with children who had participated in the control condition. 85 38 Table 13.

Abbreviations: ABC = Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch Up; G = group; N = number; NR not reported; NS = not specified; RCT = randomized controlled trial. Three articles report findings from a second trial which used the same comparator as in the previously described trial but targeted biological parents. In one paper, the authors found a significantly lower proportion of disorganized attachments and increased proportion of secure attachment among children in the ABC group following the intervention. 81 Another article found 39 that ABC children expressed less angry feelings following a series of challenging tasks.83 In a third paper, the authors indicated that ABC children exhibited significantly more normalized patterns of cortisol production than control children.82 Table 14 presents the results of the ABC trial with foster parents compared with wait- list control; additional study details a re provided in the evidence tables (Appendix E) .80 The authors describe the study as combining elements of efficacy and effectiveness studies by applying specific components of an RCT to a clinic -based setting with a \"naturally occurring treatment - seeking population.\" 80,p82 The study explicitly focused on children who had experienced severe maltreatment resulting in termination of parental rights and disruptions in their primary attachment relationships. An eligibility criterion for inclusion in the study was treatment readiness (families were prescreened for readiness prior to randomization). The authors examined child internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, parenting attitudes reflective of child abuse potential, and parenting stress with widely used and highly validated measures. A detailed summary of the results is provided in Appendix E. Compared with foster parents in the wait-list condition, participants in A BC reported significant improvements in child internalizing and externalizing problems (low and medium effect sizes, respectively) and reduction in negative parenting attitudes, practices associated with child abuse (large effect size), and parenting stres s (medium effect size ).

Abbrev iations: ABC = Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch Up; G = group; Although the ABC trials yielded promising results, we graded the SOE as low for both mental and behavioral health and caregiver -child relationship outcomes due to the presence of only two tr ials ( Table 15). As explained previously (see Methods), when evidence supporting an intervention is sparse (i.e., < 2 studies) the body of evidence is graded as low. We graded the SOE in the study comparing ABC with wait- list control as low due to the prese nce of the single , small, quasi -effectiveness study. 40 Table 15.

Attachment -Based Intervention We identified one RCT comparing another low -intensity, home -based intervention with usual care, referred to here as an \" Attachment -based Intervention\"86 (Table 16) . The authors describe this intervention as being loosely based on Attachment and Biohavioral Catch U p along with other attachment -oriented approaches described in the literature. The study spanned inf ants to preschool -aged children and their biological mothers or fathers. The study assessed children' s internalizing and externalizing behavior, maternal sensitivity, and attachment behavior using direct measures. Table 16.

The study found no statistically significant difference in child internalizing or externalizing behavior problems by study arm. However, the intervention did demonstrate efficacy in maternal sensitivity and child attachment outcomes, reporting small to medium effect sizes. Table 17.

Child-Parent Psychotherapy We identified two RCTs that compared CPP, a high- intensity home -based intervention, with an active control and also with usual care ( Table 19 ).87,88 One R CT targeted 12 -month- old infants and mothers; the other trial targeted 4 -year-old children and mothers. The results of these two RCTs pertain to Cicchetti and colleagues ' variant of CPP. Both studies used the same active comparator, a psychoeducational int ervention derived from Olds and colleagues ' nurse home visitation model.94 Table 19.

Key Point s Healthy caregiver -child relationship : o Preschool -age children who participated in CPP reported significantly fewer negative attachment representations compared with an active control88; howeve r, for younger children, there were no significant differences in efficacy of the intervention on secure attachment behavior (insufficient SOE).87 o When compared with usual care, infants who participated in CPP dem onstrated significantly greater improvements in secure attachment behavior and preschool -age children reported significantly fewer negative attachment representations (low SOE of benefit). 87,88 43 Detailed Synthesis Based on the comparisons, we graded the SOE as insufficient for caregiver -child relationship outcomes due to nonsignificant findings in one study and inconsistent findings across the two studies ( Table 20). Based on the inactive control comparisons, we grad ed the SOE as low for caregiver -child relationship outcomes due to the presence of only two trials, one of which used an indirect measure with most subscales showing nonsignificant differences. Table 20 presents the results for the two CPP trials; additional study details are provided in the evidence tables (Appendix E) . In the initial trial with preschool- age children and their mothers,88 the authors examined child mental representations of the child -parent attachment relationship. Children' s mental representations were predominantly maladaptive and negative at baseline across study conditions. The study found a significant decline in children 's negative mental representations in the CPP group compared with the active control. However, only trends or nonsignificant differences were found for the other subscales of the outcome measure. The authors did not report effect sizes. The other trial, conducted with mother -infant pairs, 87 found no significant differences in efficacy of the intervention on children' s secure attachment by study arm; the nonsignificant difference was based on a direct measure of attachment. This study also found nonsignificant differenc es between the CPP and active control group on a direct measure of maternal sensitivity and several self -report measures of parenting (e.g., parenting attitudes, child -rearing stress, and social support). In the Toth et al. trial with preschoolers, 88 comparisons between CPP and the usual care study arm demonstrated significant improvement in children 's negative mental representations but, again, no other significant differences for the other subs cales on the measure. The second study87 found significant improvements in secure child attachment in the CPP group compared with usual care, with predominantly large effect sizes. The study did not report comparis ons between CPP and usual care on maternal measures. Based on the comparisons, we graded the SOE as insufficient for caregiver -child relationship outcomes due to nonsignificant findings in one study and inconsistent findings across the two studies ( Table 21). Based on the inactive control comparisons, we graded the SOE as low for caregiver -child relationship outcomes due to the presence of only two trials, one of which used an indirect measure with most subscales showing nonsignificant differences. 44 Table 20.

Incredible Years Adaptat ion One RCT (Table 2 2) tested a co -parenting adaptation of the Incredible Years (IY) program , modified for use with biological and foster parent pairs and their children, age 3 to 10 years, compared with usual care.89 The number of sessions for standard IY varies by age of child; the number of sessions is 18 to 20 for parents of preschool -age children and 12 to 16 for parents of early school -age to preadolescent children. The included trial reduced the number of ses sions to a lower intensity approach (12 sessions). Table 22.

In this study, the authors examined changes in caregiver -reported discipline practices as well as caregiver and teacher report of child behavioral problems. The study found no significant differences for caregiver report or teacher report of child behavioral problems at postintervention or at 3- month followup. However, IY participants were significantly more likely to endorse positive discipline practices at both postintervention and follow -up (small to medium effect sizes), and a significant group difference emerged at followup in reporting of setting clear expectations for the child (medium effect size). The authors also reported that biological caregivers were significantly more likely to retain improvements in self -reported positive discipli ne practices through followup compared with foster parents. Regarding coparenting outcomes, the trial demonstrated a benefit for some but not all dimensions assessed at postintervention (flexibility and problem - solving but not mutual social support; small to medium effect sizes); however, these group differences faded by followup.

The authors examined parent daily report of child problem behaviors and use of positive reinforcement, assessed 5 months postbaseline. Proportion of positive reinforcement (R+) was calculated as a ratio of R+; discipline behaviors were aggregated from the parent report data and an intensive, 2- hour interview with the foster parent. Results controlled for baseline scores and indicated significant improvement in problem behaviors for the KEEP g roup relative to routine foster care, as well as an increase in positive reinforcement as a proportion of total foster parent discipline; the study reports small effect sizes for both outcomes. The intervention effect was greatest among foster parents who reported more than six child behavior problems at baseline. Table 26.

Nurse Home Visitation Intervention We identified one effectiveness trial (RCT), reported in one article,93 comparing a high- intensity nurse home visitation intervention with usual care ( Table 28). The intervention was loosely derived from Olds and colleagues ' model.178 The study targeted children 13 years and younger with a recent history of physical abuse or neglect and their mothers.

The study was set in the waiting room of a clinic and conducted before and after the child 's forensic evaluation to confirm the suspected sexual abuse. The authors examined se veral outcomes relevant to KQ 1; however, most measures were developed by the study authors and without established validity. Thus, we include here only outcomes from the one valid measure, a child self -report measure of the impact of the traumatic experience. There were no significant differences between groups regarding child -reported problems related to the sexual abuse (e.g., social support, self -blame, negative reactions to others, and empowerment).

Six of the trials were RCTs107,108,112,113,115,116 and one was a nonrandomized controlled trial.114 All studies were efficacy trials (i.e., none of the studies self -identified as an effectiveness trial or did not meet the criteria for an effectiveness trial). All interventions included a child component. One trial also targeted a caregiver who had physically abused their child.107 Four trials, all focused on children exposed to sexual abuse, also included components directed at the nonmaltreating caregiver.108,113,115,116 One trial targeted children in early adolescence.112 One trial compared the experimental intervention with an inactive control group (e.g., wait list).114 Six trials used active control groups. o Three trials employed active control comparators representative of conventional practices in the field.108,113,116 o Three trials employed active control comparators that were derived approaches.107,112,115 All seven trials reported men tal and behavioral health outcomes. Three trials reported on caregiver -child relationship outcomes.107,108,116 No trials assessed developmental or school -based functioning outcomes. Combined Parent -Child Cognitive Behavioral Therapy We identified one RCT (one article)107 comparing a medium -intensity group- based approach, Combined Parent -Child Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CPC -CBT), with an active comparator described by the authors as similar to but more comprehensive than usual parenting services offered in the community ( Table 36 ).107 The study targeted physically abusive parents (defined as a substantiated allegation of child physi cal abuse in the past 4 months or who endorsed physical punishment on a standardized measure). To be eligible for the study, children (age 7 to 54 13) had to meet trauma symptom criteria of either endorsement of four post -traumatic stress disorder symptoms or elevated externalizing behavior scores on standardized measures.

Key Points Mental and behavioral health : Compared with an active control, participants in CPC - CBT had a significantly greater reduction in trauma symptoms; however, ther e was no significant difference in efficacy of the intervention on child internalizing or externalizing behavior problems (low SOE of benefit).107 Healthy caregiver -child relationship : Compared with an active contr ol, parents in CPC - CBT reported significantly greater increases in positive parenting practices; however, the control group reported significantly lower use of corporal punishment compared with participants in CPC -CBT. Based on child report, there were no significant differences in efficacy of the intervention on positive parenting practices or use of corporal punishment (insufficient SOE). 107 Detailed Synthesis Table 37 presents the results of the CPC -CBT trial;107 additional study details are provided in the evidence tables (Appendix E). The authors examined child trauma symptoms and behavioral problems as well as child and parent reports of positive parenting skills and us e of corporal punishment. Parents in both study arms reported significant reductions in child PTSD symptoms and internalizing problems, with no statistically significant difference between treatment groups at either followup. The difference between groups was also nonsignificant for externalizing behavior problems. At postintervention, parents who participated in CPC -CBT reported a significantly greater increase in positive parenting practices compared with the active control (medium effect size). However, the control group reported significantly lower use of corporal punishment compared with participants in CPC -CBT (medium effect size). The authors also reported results at 3 -month follow -up but the attrition rates at this time point were beyond our threshol d for inclusion. The authors also reported that two families had new substantiated abuse allegations at followup but did not indicate the condition in which the families participated. 55 Table 37.

The comparator was a substantively modified version of Trauma Focused- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF -CBT) in that only the child component was retained from the original model (the standard version includes components that involve the caregiver; see Table 1 in the Introduction chapter for a description of standard TF -CBT). Additionally, it is not clear the extent to which other cor e components of TF -CBT were implemented with fidelity in this trial. The study targeted 12 - to 13- year-old girls who reported sexual abuse victimization within the past 6 months (but not ongoing); a clinically significant level of trauma symptoms was requi red for participation in the study. The study was conducted in Iran (Table 39 ). Table 39.

EMDR is a low -intensi ty treatment, with an active control (N=7). The authors examined parent and child report of child trauma symptoms and teacher report of child behavior problems. Youth who participated in the EMDR condition reported a significant reduction in post -traumatic stress symptoms at treatment end whereas participants in the control group did not show significant declines in symptoms. However, the difference between groups did not reach statistical significance. Parent report of child trauma symptoms significantly d eclined from pre - to post -test for both the EMDR condition ( p<0.05) and the control group. Again, the difference between groups was not significant. Similarly, teacher report of child problem behaviors declined for both the EMDR and control conditions; how ever, there was no difference between groups. The use of the substantively modified comparative intervention makes it difficult to interpret the findings; additionally, the setting (Iran) limits the generalizability of the findings. 57 Table 40.

Group Psychotherapy for Sexually Abused Girls We identified one RCT (one article)113 evaluating a medium -intensity, psychoeducational and psychotherapeutic group treatment for sexually abused girls compared with an active control (Table 42). The control treatment was conventional psychoanalytic individual therapy (high intensity; up to 30 weekly 50- minute sessions). Both the experimental and control treatments shared generic and abuse -specific components including maintaining the therapeutic alliance, managing anxieties, and appropriately handling postabuse and current con cerns. The two conditions also included a caregiver -directed component comprising social work support (delivered in either a group or individual mode aligned with that of the child- directed component). The study targeted girls between the ages of 6 and 14 years of age and was conducted in London. Nearly three -quarters of the sample had a DSM -IV diagnosis of PTSD (73%); the other main DSM -IV diagnoses in the sample were separation anxiety disorder (58%), major depressive disorder (57%), and general anxiety disorder (37%). 58 Table 42.

Key Points Mental and behav ioral health : Girls who participated in the group therapy treatment had significantly worse outcomes in trauma symptoms compared with an active control. There was no significant difference in efficacy of the group psychotherapy treatment on trauma symptoms or functional impairment (low SOE of greater benefit for active control ). 113 Detailed Synthesis Table 43 presents the results of the group psychotherapy treatment;113 additional study details are provided in the evidence tables (Appendix E). The authors examined trauma and other symptoms of emotional or behavioral disturbance. The authors set a criterion of medium to large effect sizes ( 0.5) for reporting findings. At the first followup, 1 year after baseline (start of therapy), children who participated in the c ontrol condition exhibited significantly greater improvements in PTSD symptomatology compared with those in group psychotherapy: re - experiencing of traumatic events ( medium effect size ) and persistent avoidance of stimuli dimensions ( medium effect size ). These group- difference findings were sustained at the second followup (2 years postentry into treatment) for re -experiencing symptoms ( borderline large effect size) and persistent avoidance of stimuli (small effect size), again with greater improvements exhibited by children who participated in the control condition. No significant between -group differences were found for the PTSD dimension of \" persistent symptoms of increased arousal \" or for the Kiddie Global Assessment Scale impairment index. 59 Table 43.

Group Treatment Program for Sexual Abuse We identified one nonrandomized controlled trial ( Table 45 ) comparing a high -intensity psychoeducational and psychotherapeutic group treatment for sexual abuse victims with a wait - list control group. The study targeted sexually abused girls between the ages of 9 and 12 years, referred from CPS or other sources, including self -referral. In describing the intervention, the 60 authors briefly list its components and also characterize it as \" similar to hundreds of treatment programs provided to children who have been sexually abused.\" Table 45.

The authors examined participants ' emotional and behavioral adjustment following t he abuse. Participants in the group treatment had significantly greater reductions in conduct problems. Comparing post -test means across study arms, the study found significant differences in improvement across numerous subscales of a behavioral measure. H owever, these findings must be interpreted with caution in light of the nonrandomized design and very small sample size. 61 Table 46.

Trauma -Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy We identified three RCTs evaluating the efficacy of Trauma -Focused Cognitive Behavioral Ther apy (TF -CBT), a low - to medium -intensity (12 to 16 weekly sessions) treatment ( Table 48 ). Two trials compared TF -CBT with active controls developed by the study authors. The initial trial,115 conducted with childre n age 2 to 7 years, used a derived comparator designed to control for nonspecific aspects of the experimental intervention (focused on reducing isolation and hopelessness while improving emotion identification; no explicit focus on the sexual abuse). A second trial, 108 conducted w ith children age 8 to 14 years, used conventional child- centered 62 therapy focused on developing a trusting therapeutic alliance and allowed therapy goals to be directed by child and parent (2 sessions directed towards processing the sexual abuse if the clients did not spontaneously talk about the abuse). A third trial, 116 conducted with children age 2 to 8 years, compared a group adaptation of TF -CBT with a conventional supportive parent group developed by the authors. The control treatment focused on topics individual group members selected with an emphasis on active listening , unconditional positive regard, and reflecting feelings. The authors describe the experimental and control treatments as being similar in content but differing in the methods used to deliver information and skills, with the former using an interactive beh avioral therapy format and the latter using a didactic format.

Key Points Mental and behavioral health : o Compared with active con trols, participants in TF -CBT had significantly greater improvements in trauma symptoms; however, findings were inconsistent across the two trials for internalizing sexual behavior problems (low SOE of benefit).108,115 o There were no significant differences in efficacy of the TF -CBT Group Adaptation compared with an active control on trauma symptoms or behavioral problems, including sexual behavior (insufficient SOE). 116 Healthy caregiver -child relationship : o Compared with an active control, parents who participated in TF -CBT had signi ficantly greater reductions in depression and increased use of positive parenting practices (low SOE of benefit).108 o Compared with an active control, mothers who participated in TF -CBT Group Adaptation had significantly greater declines in intrusive thoughts; however, there were no significant differences in efficacy of TF -CBT on mother 's avoidant thoughts, trauma symptoms, or parenting practices (insufficient SOE). 116 Detailed Synthesis Table 49 presents the results of the standard TF -CBT trials;108,115 additional study details are provided in the evidence tables (Appendix E). In the initial trial,115 the authors examined young children 's social competence, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing behavior including 63 sexual behavior. Participants in TF -CBT had signi ficantly greater improvements on an overall measure of problem behavior, including a subscale on internalizing symptoms; however, there was no difference in efficacy of TF -CBT on the externalizing or social competence scales of the same measure. TF -CBT als o resulted in improvements in sexual behavior as measured using a sexual behavior inventory. A second trial108 with older children examined trauma symptoms, internalizing problems (using several measures), externalizing behaviors including sexual behavior problems, and social competence. This study also included parent depression and parenting practices outcomes. Participants in TF -CBT had significantly greater reductions in trauma symptoms compared with the control group: re -experiencing of the abuse (borderline medium effect size ), decreases in avoidance of reminders of the abuse (medium -to-large effect size), and decreased hypervigilance (medium effect size). TF -CBT participants also experienced significant reductions in depression symptoms (medium effect size). However, there we re no significant differences in efficacy of TF -CBT on internalizing problems including anxiety and no group differences in externalizing problems, sexual behavior problems, or social competence. A statistically significant between -group difference was fou nd for the total score on the Child Behavior Check list, although the low T -scores (< 40) call into question the clinical significance of the finding . Parents who participated in TF -CBT reported significant reductions in depressive symptoms (small effect size) and increased use of positive parenting practices (medium effect size) compared with the active control.

For the trials comparing standard TF -CBT with active controls, we graded the SOE as low for both mental and behavioral health and caregiver -child relationship outcomes ( Table 51 ). 66 Although the sample size was relatively large for one of the trials, the SOE is limited by number of trials and the inconsistent findings. For the trial testing the TF -CBT Group Adaptation against an active control, we graded the SOE as insufficient for mental and behavioral health outcomes due to nonsignificant findings. Table 51.

Below we provide an overview of the key features in the body of evidence for enhanced foster care interventi ons. All four trials were RCTs.117-124,126 -129,131,136 -139,141,142,179 All studies were efficacy trials (i.e., none of the studies self -identified as an effectiveness trial or did not meet th e criteria for an effectiveness trial). Two of the experimental interventions included caregiver components. Both targeted children in early childhood.117-124,126 -129,139,141,142,179 One tr ial assessed an intervention that targeted the child only.131 Three trials compared the experimental intervention with usual care .117-124,126 -129,139,141,142,179 One trial compa red the experimental intervention with an inactive control group (i.e., assessment only).131 All four trials reported on mental and behavioral health outcomes. Two trials also reported on healthy caregiver -child relationship and development outcomes .117-124,126 -129,139,141,142,179 None of the included trials assessed school -based functioning outcomes. One trial was completed outside of the United States. It was in Bucharest, Ro mania, and targeted children in institutional care .117-124,126 -129 Bucharest Early Intervention Project We identified one RCT (13 articles)117-129 evaluating a high -intensi ty model of enhanced supports to foster parents adopting infants and toddlers from institutional care in Bucharest, Romania ( Table 54 ). The trial, known as the Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP), is a landmark research study examining the efficacy of enhanced foster care with children who have experienced severe social deprivation ( Table 54 ). The intervention model is based on a similar approach developed by one of the study authors and implemented in the United States. 130 The sample comprised children residing in one of six institutions; children with medical problems, such as genetic syndromes, observable characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome, and microcephaly, were ineligible for the study. The primary inclusion criterion was f or children to have entered their resident institution prior to 31 months of age. 69 Table 54.

An article by Zeanah and colleagues129 reported psychiatric disorder outcomes using a caregiver report measure that queried the presence, frequency, duration, and age at onset of symptoms corresponding to those in the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Ma nual.180 Scoring algorithms correspond to DSM diagnoses and to composite, categorical diagnoses, such as internalizing and externalizing disorders. Although externalizing disorders did not occur at significantly different rates, internalizing disorders were more common in institutional care group children and these children were also more likely to meet criteria for an anxiety disorder. No significant group differences were observed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, disruptive disorders, depressive dis order, or diagnostic comorbidity. Differences in internalizing disorders by gender were further explored by McLaughlin 2012, finding that among girls, those placed in foster care were less likely than the institutional group to have internalizing symptoms, internalizing disorders, anxiety, and depression. No differences were found by intervention group among males in internalizing. The foster care intervention had no effect on externalizing symptoms or on externalizing disorders in either girls or boys. In a paper examining psychiatric problems, 118 Bos et al. reported reductions in stereotypic behaviors often observed in contexts of deprivation and institutionalization, with improvements favoring children in BEIP at all time points. Three articles 121,125,127 examined group differences in children' s attachment behavior and offered relatively consistent support for the ability to alter attachment through BEIP. Attachment was ass essed using a structured procedure, known as the \" Strange Situation, \" in which the child experiences separations from and reunions with the parent that represent laboratory analogues of normative parent -child separations . 181 At 42 months, children in BE IP improved significantly in the security and organization attachment relative to their institutionalized peers, more of whose attachment styles remained insecure and disorganized. Among children placed in foster care, 77 girls were more likely to have an organized attachment (compared with atypical attachment) classification than boys, and more likely to have secure attachment (compared with not secure) than boys. Analysis by age at placement in foster care showed that using multiple cut points for age (placement points between 18 and 28 months of age), children placed earlier when compared with those placed later for all age cutoffs were significantly more likely to have an organized attachment. For secure versus insecure attachment, children placed before 24 months of age were more likely to have secure attachment than those placed in foster care after 24 months. Time in foster care was also significant, with children being placed for longer time in foster care more likely to have an organized attachment than those placed for a shorter time. Differences in attachment by gender were further explored by McLaughlin and colleagues, finding that among females, those placed in foster care were more likely than the institutional group to ha ve secure attachment and ch ange from insecure/incompletely formed to secure attachment. 125 No differences were found by intervention group among males. Johnson and colleagues compared the quality of caregiving across study conditions. At 30 months and a combined 30/42 months, caregiving quality in BEIP outperformed the institutional care group. 121 Higher caregiving quality was significantly associated with improvements in child height and weight. Seven articles investigated the efficacy of BEIP in promoting children 's cognitive functioning and development.117,119,121,122,124,126,128 Nelson126and Johnson121 compared children 's mental development and intellectual ability across study conditions. At 42 and 54 months, children in BEIP outperformed the institutional care group (medium effect sizes). Intellectual ability was also comp ared across study conditions when children were 8 years old. 119 Children in BEIP outperformed the institutional care group in the verbal subscale. One article compared expressive and receptive language.128 At 30 months children in foster care outperformed the institutional group in receptive language, and by 42 months they outperformed the institutional group in receptive and expressive language. Placement age was significan tly associated with both expressive and receptive language. Children placed by 15 months of age had higher receptive and expressive scores at 30 months than children placed later and outperformed the institutional care group, moreover, the expressive score s of children placed before 15 months were equivalent to never -institutionalized children. By 42 months, children placed before 24 months of age had longer utterances than children placed after 24 months and outperformed the institutional care group. The sequelae of maltreatment and adversity can include impairments in critical aspects of executive functioning. These include attention and impulsivity, task accuracy and efficiency, and higher order cognitive functions, presumably related to interference of stress symptomatology. In an article by Ghera and colleagues, 120 the authors examined children' s attention and affect. At 30 months, attention levels in the two groups did not differ significantly but by 42 months children in the BEIP condition had significantly higher attention levels than the children who remained in institutionalized care. Additionally, at both 30 and 42 months, children participating in BEIP displayed more positive affect; however, there was no significant difference between study arms in negative affect at any time point. Two articles 117,123 analyzed executive functioning at age 8. Children in foster care outperformed the institutional care group in stra tegy abilities,117 accuracy,123 faster reaction time,123 and differential reactivity (better error related negativity difference s core between correct and error trials of inhibitory control task). Neither group differed in their ability to inhibit responses .123 Another article122 investigated cogniti ve functioning at the neurophysiological level comparing electroencephalogram (EEG) band power and coherence (as indices of neurological 78 maturation and cortical functioning) across the study conditions. EEG band power reflects the rhythmicity of the EEG signal across different frequencies. Coherence signifies the degree of synchronization between measurements from two different cortical areas; decreased coherence is thought to reflect greater brain complexity and differentiation. At 42 months, there were no significant differences between study conditions for band power or coherence. Additional analyses examined the interactions between EEG band power and coherence with age of foster placement. Differences in coherence were found for children placed in foster care earlier than 24 months but not for those placed later. EEG was also reported in relation to differential hemispheric activation. 124 Frontal EEG asymmetry (FEA) with right greater than left activation is asso ciated with internalizing psychopathology. Although there were no significant differences in frontal and parietal FEA between children placed in foster care and the institutional care group, FEA among children placed before 24 months of age showed a signif icantly more favorable growth trajectory of FEA than children placed after 24 months. In the area of physical growth, Johnson 121 compared children 's height and weight across study conditions. Children in BEIP outpe rformed the institutional care group in mean growth and change in growth for height and weight from baseline to 42 months. Although this study was a rated a low risk of bias and provided precise outcome estimates, we graded the SOE as low for the mental an d behavioral health, caregiver -child relationship, and developmental outcomes due to the presence of a single study (Table 56) .

The study compares FHF, a high -intensity intervention, with an inactive control group (assessment -only condition). The study targeted maltreated children placed in out -of-home care (age 9 to 11). 79 Table 57.

Immediately following the intervention, participants in FHF reported significantly higher quality of life scores than youth in the control group (small effect size); no other significant differences emerged at postintervention. At followup, participants in FHF showed significantly greater improvements than youth in the control group on a composite mental health index representing child, teacher, and caregiver report of trauma symptoms and internalizing problems (medium effect size). Also at followup, participants in FHF reported significantly greater improvement in dissociative symptoms compared with youth in the control group (small effect sizes for both outcomes). 80 Table 58.

We include only the followup timepoints for which KQ 1 outcome data are reported in the paper and renumbered the timepoints accordingly. Abbreviations: G = group; MSS number; RCT = randomized controlled trial; RFC = regular foster care control group ; T = time . Key Points Mental and behavioral health: Compared with usual care, participants in the Middle School Succ ess intervention experienced significantly greater reductions in internalizing problems, frequency of substance use, and use of tobacco and marijuana and significantly greater increases in prosocial behavior compared with youth in routine foster care (low SOE of benefit). Detailed Synthesis Table 61 presents the results of the Middle School Success trial;136,137 additional study details are provided in the evidence tables (Appendix E). In an article by Smith and col leagues,137 the authors examined parent report of child internalizing and externalizing problems as well as prosocial behavior through 6- months postbaseline. The study found that youth in the intervention condition had significant reductions in internalizing and externalizing problems at followup compared with the usual care, taking into account participants ' maltreatment history, pubertal development, and internalizing/externalizing problems at baseline. No signifi cant group differences were found for prosocial behavior. In a second paper, 136 the authors again collected caregiver report data on internalizing and externalizing symptoms and prosocial behavior (using different measures than in the first study). This paper also reports data on substance use and delinquency (behavior, association with a deviant peer, and a composite score based on the mean of girls ' own delinquent behavior and her association with delinquent peers ), collected via child 82 self-report. Significant group differences were found in favor of the Middle School Success intervention for prosocial behaviors at both 6- and 12- month followup. At 36 months, participants in the intervention reported less frequent substance use (composite score based on mean of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use) and were also less likely to report tobacco or marijuana use over the past 12 months compared with youth in usual care. There were no significant group differences in inte rnalizing and externalizing symptoms or alcohol use; however, a trend in favor of the intervention condition over the control group was found for delinquent behavior and the composite delinquency score (in the prior year).

Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Preschoolers We identified five articles relevant to KQ 1 outcomes for a trial evaluation of Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Preschoolers (MTFC -P),138,139,141,142,179comparing this high -intensity foster care intervention to usual care ( Table 63 ). The study was targeted at young children (3 to 6 years of age), foster or kin caregiver, and permanent placement resource (birth parents and adoptive relatives or nonrelatives). Table 63.

Key Points Mental and behavioral health : Children who participated in MTFC -P exhibited more normative (regulated) co rtisol levels compared with children in usual foster care (low SOE of benefit) .138,142,179 Healthy caregiver -child relationship : Compared with usual care, children who participated in MTFC -P had significantly grea ter increases in secure attachment behavior and decreases in avoidant attachment behavior; additionally, caregivers who participated in MTFC reported significantly less stress related to child problem behaviors (low SOE of benefit) . 139,141 Healthy development : Compared with usual care, children who participated in MTFC -P exhibited significantly higher levels of electrophysiological functioning during a cognitive task; however, there was no significant difference in efficacy of the intervention on cognitive functioning as measured by a behavioral assessment (low SOE of benefit). 138 84 Detailed Synthesis Table 64 presents the results of the MTFC -P trial in regards to KQ1 outcomes;138,139, 141,142,179 additional study details are provided in the evidence tables. An article by Fisher and colleagues142 that examined cortisol regulation (morning level, evening level, and morning -to-evening change) found that children in MTFC -P were significantly more likely to exhibit a pattern of relative cortisol stability whereas the childre n in usual care exhibited a significant decline (medium effect sizes). Another paper179 examined cortisol regulation among children who had experienced a placement change and found that children in MTFC -P experienced more typical morning -to-evening cortisol levels (e.g., higher in the morning and lower in the evening) following a placement change than children in regular foster care following a placement change. Regular foster care subjects had relatively blunted co rtisol patterns from morning to evening. Table 64.

In other papers, Fisher and colleagues139,141 examined outcomes reflective of the caregiver - child relationship. Fisher and Kim,139 examined child attachment behavior as reported by the caregiver. The study found significant differences in report of increased secure attachment behaviors and decreased insecure- avoidant attachment behavior favoring the MTFC -P condition. No group differences were found for insecure -resistant behavior . In a second study examining caregiver -child relationship outcomes, Fisher and Stoolmiller179 found that caregiver report of stress in response to child problem behaviors showed significantly greater declines compared with usual care, with an early decline in stress during the initial 2 study months that remained stable over the ensuing 10 months. A fifth article examined cognitive functioning across study conditions. 138 The authors measured children 's behavioral performance during cognitive tasks (cognitive control and 86 response monitoring) and electrophysiological response (a substrate of cognitive processing) to cognitive tasks. Participants in MTFC -P did not differ significantly from usual care children on tasks of self -monitoring ( \"errors of commission \") or reaction time to response. However, electrophysiological responses (measured by EEG) to external stimul i (\"response locked\" and \"feedback locked \" conditions) during cognitive tasks showed significant improvement for MTFC -P relative to usual care (response locked F=5.66, p<0.01; feedback locked, F=5.82, p<0.01). We graded the SOE as low for the mental and b ehavioral health, caregiver -child relationship, and developmental outcomes due to the presence of a single study ( Table 65 ). Table 65.

Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions for Improving Child Welfare Outcomes Organization As in KQ 1, we organize KQ 2 by intervention type (parenting, trauma -focused, and enhanced foster care approaches). We begin this section with a description of included studies and an accompanying table presenting the number of trials and articles investigating child welfare outcomes by intervention type. Next, for e ach subsection, we begin with an overview of key features of the evidence base for the intervention type and then present the findings for each intervention. Findings include very brief key points presenting the main findings for KQ outcomes and the corres ponding strength of evidence (SOE) grade. Immediately following the key points is a detailed synthesis of the findings for each intervention, providing information about study characteristics, the specific results (including magnitude of effect, if provide d by study authors), and the SOE by grading domain (risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision). Please refer to the Strength of Evidence Grading section in the Methods chapter for further detail about the SOE grading criteria. We remind the reader that benefit is denoted in the results tables using a greater ( \">\") sign (e.g., Group 1 > Group 2). Also, the results table s present within -group changes denoted as improvement ( \"+\"), detriment ( \"\"), nonsignificant change ( \"ns\") for studies that pr ovided these data. Parenting Interventions Description of Included Studies Table 67 presents the five trials ( five articles) evaluating four parenting interventions included in KQ 2. Table 67.

All five trials were randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ). Four trials were effectiveness trials.92,93,95,100 Four of the trials targeted maltreating parents and assessed safety outcomes .93,95,96,100 One trial targeted foster and kinship parents and assessed both placement stability and permanency outcomes .92 All five trials compared the experimental intervention with usual care.92,93,95,96,100 88 Keeping Foster and Kinship Parents Trained and Supported We identified one large RCT comparing the effectiveness of the Keeping Foster and Kinship Parents Trained and Supported (KEEP) intervention with a usual car e group for improving child welfare outcomes ( Table 68 ).92 This RCT also reported outcomes relevant to KQ 1 (see previous section of Results chapter).

Key Points Placement stability : Comparing usual care wi th KEEP, there was no difference in placement stability outcomes in one trial (insufficient evidence).92 Permanency : Compared with usual care, participants in KEEP had a significantly greater proportion of posit ive exits from foster care (e.g., reunification with biological parent or another relative or adoption for the duration of the study period) (moderate SOE for benefit).92 Detailed Synthesis Table 69 presents the results for the KEEP trial; additional study details are provided in the evidence tables (Appendix E).92 Using child welfare records, the study authors examined negative placement changes (e.g., child being moved to a new foster care placement, a more restrictive environment such as psychiatric care or juvenile detention center, or child runaways), as a measure of placement instability. The authors also examined positive placement changes , defined as positive exit s from foster care such as reunification with the biological parent or another relative or adoption. Although these positive placement exits were not identified as permanency outcomes in the study, we categorized them as such here with the caveat that they were outcomes sustained for the duration of the study. Results from Cox hazard models revealed children in KEEP were nearly twice as likely to exit their foster or kinship placement home for positive reasons compared with those in the usual care group. This finding was for the full sample, which included children with as many as 20 previous placements. Rates of negative placement changes were not significantly different between the two groups. However, the study found that number of previous placements was a significant predictor of hazard of placement disruption (i.e., negative exit) and that the intervention \" mitigated the negative risk -enhancing effect of a history of multiple placements. \" The authors also found that children living with a relative (kins hip placement) and those with longer placements were less likely to have any placement change during the intervention period. 89 Table 69.

Nurse Home Visitation Intervention We identified one RCT comparing the effectiveness of a nurse home visitation (NHV) intervention with a usual care group for improving child welfare outcomes ( Table 71 ).93 This RCT also reported outcomes relevant to KQ 1 (see previous section of Results chapter).

The authors used both CPS records and hospital re cords to assess safety outcomes. Based on the CPS data, no significant differences emerged in favor of the NHV on any of the safety measures: incidence of physical abuse, days to first incident of physical abuse, or severity of physical abuse incidents. Th ere was a borderline significant difference between the intervention and comparison groups in the severity of neglect incidents, favoring the intervention group; however, the authors indicate that the difference was not clinically important. The no- differe nce finding using the CPS data was not consistent with hospital data, which showed the recurrence of physical abuse and/or neglect was significantly more likely in the NHV group than the usual care group (23.6% versus 10.8%). The authors suggest this findi ng may be the result of detection bias as a function of the nurse home visitors \"identifying the need for medical care in children in the visited families. \" The authors also note that \" the potential for harm should not be overlooked\" but that the finding r elated to the hospital data needs to be \"taken in the context of....no clinically meaningful differences between groups \" based on child welfare records.

Parent -Child Interaction Therapy Adaptation Package We identified two RCTs evaluating an adaptation of PCIT for maltreating parents that combined PCIT with a self -motivational orientation intervention (the combined approach is referred to here as a PCIT Adaptation \" Package\" or PCIT -AP) (Table 74 ).95,96 The first trial96 was an efficacy study comparing PCIT -AP with a standard parenting program (usual care) for child welfare-involved clients and with an \" enhanced \" version of the experimental intervention that also provided families with individualized services and home visit s to reinforce skills learned during the clinical sessions. The study targeted physically abusive caregivers and their 91 children, age 4 to 12 years; many families had histories of multiple reports to CPS and severe parent -to-child violence. The second RCT95 was an effectiveness study examining the relative effects of the PCIT and the mo tivational intervention components compared with the usual care (standard orientation and parenting program). This study targeted physically abusive or neglecting caregivers and their children, age 2.5 to 12 years, as long as the caregiver had access to the child. The standard parenting program was developed at the provider agency and comprised three modules: (a) an orientation group to introduce parents to agency services and provide information about listening skills, how parenting practices influence chi ldren, and how the parents ' own upbringing has influenced the way in which they discipline and parent their children; (b) a parenting -skills group in which parents learned about child development, discipline, praise, behavior management, communication stra tegies, stress management, and the ways in which parental problems affect children; and (c) an anger management group. The overall approach relied on discussions of how parenting was conceptualized by the parent, identifying and regulating emotions, and ve rbal problem solving. Table 74.

Key Points Safety o An efficacy trial showe d benefit for PCIT -AP compared with services as usual in reducing child maltreatment recidivism (reports to the child welfare system).96 In a second RCT that was an effectiveness trial, there was not a significant difference between PCIT -AP and usual care in recidivism, although a trend was found in favor of the intervention (low SOE of benefit).95 o An enhanced version of the intervention that provided individualized services and home visit s showed no significant difference in efficacy on recidivism compared with PCIT -AP (insufficient SOE ).96 o In an effectiveness trial, PCIT -AP resulted in significantly reduced recidivism compared with the community standard parenting program combined with the experimental self -motivational orientation (low SOE ). 95 92 o In an effectiveness trial, PCIT -AP resulted in significantly reduced recidivism compared with PCIT combined with the community standard orientation (low SOE ).95 Detailed Synthesis Table 75 presents the results of the two PCIT -AP trials;96 additional study details are provided in the evidence tables (Appendix E). In the first trial, Chaffin and colleagues96 analyzed recidivism using survival analysis (length of time to event -free survival) and found the PCIT -AP condition was more e fficacious than usual care. The authors also found there was no statistically significant difference between the enhanced condition and either usual care or PCIT -AP, although there was a trend for PCIT -AP to have better survival than the enhanced PCIT condition. The second trial, an effectiveness study,95 again examined survival outcomes and found that the combination of PCIT and the self -motivational intervention resulted in significantly reduced recidivism rates c ompared with services as usual. The authors reported outcomes using a primary model with observed risk intervals and also an imputed event history model where there was imputation on survival outcomes during only risk- deprived intervals (i.e., times when the child was not with the caregiver). Findings were comparable across modeling approaches, with the greatest benefit for children living at home or who had returned to their home earlier rather than later. Table 75.

The authors provide the hazard ratio but not confidence intervals for the survival curves and describe a \" sizable trend \" in regards to the benefit of PCIT -AP over standard services (orientation and parenting program). Note: Greater comparative benefit is denoted in the results tables using a greater ( \">\") sign. Abbreviations: G = group; HR significant; PCIT -AP = Parent -Child Interaction Therapy Adaptation Package (i.e., PCIT combined with self -motivational orientation); SAU = services as usual (community standard orientation + parenting program); SM = self -motivational orientation . The authors also examined the relative effects of PCIT and the self -motivational orientation by contrasting varying combinations of experimental and usual care service components (again, see Table 75 ). The re sults, which showed benefit for PCIT -AP over other combinations, suggest a \"synergistic \" effect of combining PCIT with a motivational intervention in reducing future child abuse reports. 93 We graded the SOE as low for PCIT -AP compared with usual care in impr oving child welfare outcomes based on the results of two studies, one of which was an effectiveness trial, demonstrating precise estimates for direct outcomes and consistent benefit in favor of the intervention across studies ( Table 76 ). We graded the SOE as insufficient for addressing child welfare outcomes for PCIT -AP compared with an enhanced version due to nonsignificant findings. We also graded the SOE as insufficient for PCIT -AP enhanced compared with usual care, again, due to nonsignificant findings. Table 76.

SafeCare We identified one large RCT comparing the effectiveness of SafeCare with usual care for improving child welfare outcomes ( Table 77 ).100 The study targeted children and their maltreating parents (nonsexual abusers) living in six CPS administrative regions in one state who were involved in community home -based services provided by CPS contract agencies. In the first stage of a nested design, the six regions were randomly assigned to SafeCare or services as us ual (SAU) conditions, both of which utilized home visitors. A second stage assigned home visitors to a coached or uncoached condition (as an implementation quality control strategy). Safe Care and SAU services were comparable with the exception of the SafeC are modules (e.g., home visitors across study conditions had similar caseloads, qualifications, and funding, and service administrative goals were comparable) . The mean duration of both conditions was 6 months , with SafeCare involving at least weekly home visits and the SAU group receiving monthly home visits. Participants were children up to 12 years of age, with the majority (76%) of preschool age. The usual SafeCare inclusion criteria of a preschool -aged child and absence of untreated parental substance abuse disorder were suspended for this study; the intervention itself was not changed. 94 Table 77.

Key Points Safety : SafeCare resulted in significantly reduced child maltreatment recidivism (reports to the child welfare system) compared with usual care.100 Detailed Synthesis Table 78 presents the results of the SafeCare trial;100 additional study details are provided in the evidence tables (Appendix E). The primary outcome of inter est was child maltreatment recidivism in the form of repeat reports to CPS. Data relevant to KQ 1 were collected but not reported as group contrasts. The authors used two strategies of propensity stratification to equalize differences across home visitors (creating home visit case pairings). The first strategy \"divided Cartesian propensity score plots into 4 quadrants plus a central area.\" The one quadrant that was unbalanced was dropped. The authors refer to this as the \" 4-strata solution, \" which captured 185 of 219 home visitors and 2,035 of 2, 175 cases. The second approach used coarsened exact matching (CEM), which \" coarsens or bins continuous variables that otherwise are difficult to match exactly, then seeks exact matches, yielding more homogenous strat a but at the expense of excluding cases. \" This approach resulted in a 6- strata CEM solution, which matched 68 home visitors and 959 cases. Survival analysis of time to maltreatment recidivism indicated a main effect for SafeCare (regardless of coaching) relative to the SAU (regardless of coaching) across the entire study population (i.e., across all ages) and also for the preschool -age subpopulation. Based on the resulting hazard ratios, the authors estimated that SafeCare would prevent 64 to 104 first -year recurrences per 1,000 treated cases. Although not directly related to the comparisons of interest, two points should be noted. First, intervention compliance was similarly high across conditions and those receiving a higher intervention dosage, regardless of group assignment, recidivated at lower levels. Second, the study showed a main effect for the benefit of coaching (for the full population using the 4- strata approach); however, the findings were reported only at the level of coaching (yes or no) and not at the level of four -way contrasts (i.e., SafeCare with or without coaching compared with SAU with or without coaching) . Therefore, these data are not presented in results table. 95 Table 78.

Below we provide an overview of the key features in the body of evidence for parenting interventions. Three of the trials were RCTs132,136,140,143; the other was a nonconcurrent cohort study .130 None of the trials were effectiveness trials. One intervention targets the child only .132 All four trials target particular age subgroups: o Two in early childhood.130,140,143 o One in middle childhood.132 97 o One in early adolescence .136 One trial compares the experimental intervention with an inactive control group (assessment only) .132 Three studies compare the experimental intervention with a usual care group.130,136,140,143,144 One study reported safety outcomes.130 Two trials reported placement stability outcomes.132,136 Three studies reported permanency outcomes.130,140,143 Fostering Healthy Futures We identified one RCT (one artic le) comparing Fostering Healthy Futures (FHF) with an inactive control (an assessment -only group) for improving child welfare outcomes ( Table 82 ).132 This RCT also reported outcomes relevant to KQ 1 (see previous section of Results chapter). This article reports pla cement changes, placement in residential treatment facilities (a negative placement outcome), and permanency outcomes (attainment; type) among maltreated youth age 9 to 11 in foster care.

Key Points Place ment stability: o No significant difference in efficacy of FHF on placement changes was found for the total sample; however, among children in nonrelative foster care, participants in FHF had fewer placement changes compared with an inactive control (low SOE for benefit). 132 o Participants in FHF were less likely to be placed in a residential treatment center compared with an inactive control; similar results in favor of FHF were shown for the subsample of children placed in nonrelative foster care (low SOE for benefit). 132 Permanency: o No significant difference in efficacy of FHF on permanency was found for the total sample; however, among children placed in nonrelative foster care, participants in FHF were more likely to attain permanency compared with an inacti ve control. 132 o Participants in FHF without termination of parental rights or in foster care were more likely to be reunified compare d with their counterparts in an in active control group (low SOE of benefit ). 132 98 Detailed Synthesis Table 83 presents the results of the FHF tria l reporting outcomes relevant to KQ 2;132 additional study details are provided in the evidence tables (Appendix E). The authors examined whether children experienced a new placement in a residential treatment center, whether children attained permanency (using case closure as the index of permanency), and type of permanency (adoption or reunification with biological parents). At least a quarter of all children in the sample had been to a residential treatment center before receiving the intervention (children in residential treatment center s, a type of psychiatric facility for youth and children, are likely to receive psychotropic medications and several types of psychotherapeutic interventions). Controlling for preintervention placement in a residential treatment ce nter, along with several other covariates (type of baseline placement and baseline externalizing behavior problems), the study found no statistically significant difference between groups for number of placement changes or attainment of permanency, althoug h findings were in the expected direction in favor of the FHF. Descriptive analyses showed that most of the children who were living with a relative (kinship care) at baseline experienced few placement changes, were not subsequently placed in a residential treatment center, and achieved permanence with in the study period. Thus, the authors did subgroup analyses on the children living in nonrelative foster care as they represented a group more likely to have unstable placements. Among this subgroup, the stud y found significant benefit for FHF on placement changes, residential treatment center placement, and permanency outcomes. Treatment effects on reunification were estimated for the subsample of youth whose parental rights had not been terminated; a greater proportion of FHF participants, both across the total sample and for the subsample of youth in foster care, had reunified 1 -year postintervention compared with the control youth. Treatment effects on adoption could not be calculated because of the small n umber of cases per cell. Table 83.

Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Preschoolers We id entified one RCT comparing the effectiveness of Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Preschoolers (MTFC -P) with usual care for improving child welfare outcomes ( Table 88).140,143,144 This RCT also reported outcomes relevant to KQ 1 (see previous section of Results chapter).

Fisher et al.143 provided an early a nalysis of placement stability. The sample consisted of 90 of the 117 children in the final study sample (47 MTFC -P; 43 usual care). Children receiving MTFC -P experienced significantly fewer failed permanent placement attempts relative to those in usual ca re; that is, children receiving MTFC -P were less likely to return to CPS care after placement and case closure. Usual care children had similar rates of placement failure during their initial 10 months of care, after which their rates diverged significantl y in favor of the MTFC -P children. Another article by Fisher and colleagues provides further evidence for the efficacy of the MTFC -P approach in improving positive permanency outcomes.140 Permanent placements were attempted at equal rates for each group; however, for MTFC -P children, these attempts were more likely to be sustained on the first placement attempt and without further CPS involvement. Additionally, a larger proportion of children in the MTFC -P group rem ained in their permanent placement and required no further CPS involvement relative to usual care children. We graded the SOE as low for child welfare outcomes due to the presence of a single study (Table 90 ). Table 90.

Children adjudicated between 1991 and 1994, before the intervention was implemented, were the comparison group; children adjudicated between 1995 and 1998, after the intervention was implemented, comprised the intervention group. A comparison group of children in foster care adjudicated between 1995 and 1998 who were supposed to receive the intervention but instead received usual care were also included in a subset of the analyses as a nonintervention group. The authors examined child and maternal recidivism, length of time in foster care, and types of permanency outcomes (e.g., reunification, termination of parental rights, surrender, and relative placement).

Abbreviation : G = group. Key Points Safety . Compared with children in usual foster care, participants in the New Orleans Intervention had significant reductions in child and maternal recidivism; additionally, the intervent ion showed a trend towards reduced risk of maternal recidivism with another child (low SOE ).130 Permanency . Participation in the New Orleans Intervention resulted in increased termination of parental rights and decreased reunification outcomes compar ed with children in usual foster care (low SOE ).130 103 Detailed Synthesis The authors provide evidence for the efficacy of the New Orleans model in reducing the risk of subsequent validated incidents of maltreatment (child recidivism) comparing the inte rvention with the comparison and nonintervention groups (Table 92) . The intervention group also experienced fewer adjudicated subsequent incidents, a more stringent maltreatment recurrence outcome, compared with the preintervention cohort. The authors repo rt that all of the documented cases of recidivism in the intervention group occurred in children returned to their birth parents or placed with relatives. However, analysis of the subgroup of children who had been returned to birth parents or placed with r elatives did not demonstrate significant differences for either validated or adjudicated subsequent maltreatment between the intervention and comparison groups. Further subgroup analysis of only children returned to birth parents again found no statistical ly significant difference between the intervention and comparison group for either validated or adjudicated subsequent maltreatment. The authors report a trend toward significance comparing the intervention and comparison group on maternal recidivism, agai n either validated or adjudicated. Similarly, a trend was found comparing the intervention and nonintervention group on maternal recidivism for validated maltreatment. Subgroup analysis of maternal recidivism among mothers whose parental rights were termin ated demonstrated a trend toward significance when comparing the intervention and comparison group on subsequent validated maltreatment incidents and a significant reduction in adjudicated maltreatment.

Note: Greater comparative benefit is denoted in the results tables using a greater ( \">\") sign. Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; G N = number; NR = not reported; RRR = relative risk reduction . No differences were found between the intervention and comparison group for length of time in foster care. The authors attribute this no- diffe rence finding in part to legal and child welfare system processes and the tendency of the court to grant continuances to give the parent more time and opportunity to prove their fitness to regain custody. The study also found that parents who participated in the intervention group were twice as likely to lose custody (termination of parental rights) and significantly less likely to be reunified with their children compared with the cohort that did not receive the intervention. The authors suggest that the \"more intense scrutiny of parents...with its focus on psychological accountability \" may have resulted in this increase and acknowledge that the decreased rates of recidivism in the intervention group may have been in part attributable to the termination of pa rental rights. Parents gaining insight about the needs of their child for a safe, stable, and nurturing environment may mobilize them to appraise realistically their parental capacity and opt for termination of parental rights , which frees the child to be adopted or reach permanency through the guardianship of a relative. Thus, the finding of increased termination of parental rights and decreased reunification can be interpreted as a clinically positive outcome. We graded the SOE for the New Orleans Intervention as low for child welfare outcomes based on the presence of a single study (Table 93) . 105 Table 93.

Key Question 3. Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions With Different Characteristics Organization The Results in this section are organized according to type of intervention characteristic assessed for key question (KQ) 3. Following the description of included studies, we present the key points which summarize the main findings for each comparison and t he strength of evidence (SOE) grade. The trials included in this section were all included in KQ 1, so they are very briefly summarized here and the reader is referred to previous sections of the Results chapter for detail about study design and findings. Description of Included Studies Several treatment characteristics were identified a priori for this KQ, based on factors of interest identified in the mental health services and intervention research literature. These characteristics were modality (i.e., format, such as individual vs. dyadic), theoretical orientation, and type of service delivery setting. We did not identify any eligible studies that compared an 106 intervention' s effectiveness across different type(s) of setting. Regarding modality and theore tical orientation, very few studies were aligned with this KQ and our team was cautious to avoid overinterpretation so as to make a study \" fit\" the question. Our intention in selecting theoretical orientation as an intervention characteristic to examine in KQ 3 was to contribute to the literature on (and ongoing debate regarding) active ingredients in efficacious interventions. However, because the majority of interventions included in this review drew on multiple theoretical underpinnings and did not espouse a unifying or overarching theoretical orientation, the results of comparisons did not lend themselves to interpretation. Additionally, many studies did not provide clear, specific detail regarding the theoretical orientation(s) of the comparative approa ch. Thus, we identified only three trials that provided meaningful comparisons for inclusion in KQ 3 ( Table 95). 77-79,81 -83,85,108 Table 95.

Three trials provided two comparisons of interventions b y theoretical orientation. Two trials focused on an attachment -based intervention;77-79,81 -83,85 one trial focused on a cognitive -behavioral approach.108 One trial targeted foster parents and the young children in their care;77-79,85 two trials focused on biological parents.81-83,108 One comparison (two trials) compared an intervention based on attachment theory with a didactic approach that emphasized teaching parents how to support their children' s language and cognitive development (derived comparator).77-79,81 -83,85,108 One trial examined the comparative efficacy of a cognitive -behavioral intervention relative t o a conventional psychodynamic approach.108 Two trials reported on mental and behavioral health outcomes.77,78,82,83,108 All three trials reported on caregiver -child relationship outcomes.79,81,108 One trial assessed developmental outcomes.85 No trials assessed school -based functioning outcomes. No trials assessed child welfare outcomes. Theoretical Orientation Key Points Attachment- based versus didactic o Mental health and behavioral outcomes : Child ren whose foster or biological parents participated in th e attachment -based intervention had better mental and behavioral 107 health outcomes than children whose foster parents participated in the didactic intervention (low SOE of benefit).77,78,82,83 o Healthy caregiver -child relationship: Parents (foster or biological) who participated in the attachment -based intervention reported significantly more positive caregiver - child relationship outcomes compared with parents w ho participated in the didactic comparator (low SOE of benefit ).79,81 o Healthy development: Children whose foster parents participated in the attachment - based intervention exhibited higher levels of cognitive functi oning compared with children in the didactic condition.85 Cognitive behavioral versus psychodynamic o Mental health and behavioral outcomes: Children participating in the cognitive - behavioral approach reported better mental health outcomes compared with participants in the psychodynamic condition (low SOE ). 108 o Healthy caregiver -child relationship: Children and caregivers participating in the cognitive -behavioral approach reported better caregiver -child relationship outcomes than participants in the psychodynamic condition (low SOE ).108 Detailed Synthesis We identified three trials that compared interventions ' effectiveness by theoretical orientation. We note these studies in Table 96 but do not discuss them here, as they are discussed in previous sections of the Results chapter. Table 96.

Authors did not report effect size s for some measures. Abbreviations: G = group; KQ = key question; N = numbers; NR = Not Reported Key Question 4. Comparison of Intervention Effectiveness for Improving Child Well -Being or Child Welfare Outcomes in Population Subgroups Organization We or ganize the results for key question ( KQ) 4 by overarching category of child or caregiver subgroup population. Each section provides a brief overview of the included studies, the key points, and a summary strength of evidence (SOE) table for the different s ubgroups. Because all studies included in this section are also included in either or both KQ 1 and KQ 2, 108 the reader is referred to previous sections for detail about the study design and findings. Also in the interest of reducing repetition, we do not repeat findings with insufficient SOE in KQ 4. Below we list the subgroups that were specified a priori for consideration in KQ 4: KQ 4a. Child subgroups: o Age and other sociodemographic subgroups (e.g., race, ethnicity, sex) o Type of maltreatment exposure (e.g., neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse) o Severity of maltreatment exposure o Presence of mental or behavioral health problems or other special needs KQ 4b. Caregiver subgroups: o Primary (relative), or adop tive caregivers; residential program or group home o Presence of mental health problems, substance abuse, or domestic violence o Sociodemographic groups (e.g., age, race, ethnicity, sex) Description of Included Studies We identified 23 trials which addressed the subgroups specified for KQ 4. As noted above, all trials included in this section also were included in either or both KQ 1 and KQ 2 and all three intervention types (parenting interventions, trauma -focused treatments, and enhanced foster care interven tions) are represented in the results for KQ 4. Table 97 presents the number of trials and articles for each child and caregiver subgroup; the table also describes which intervention was evaluated with the different subpopulations of interest to this KQ. F or the age subgroup, we included those studies that limited the population to children whose ages fell within the following developmental periods: early childhood (ages 0 to 5), middle childhood (ages 6 to 10), and early adolescence (ages 11 to 14). So as not to be too restrictive, we allowed the age parameters to vary by 1 year. Hence, studies with populations that spanned wide age ranges (e.g., 3 to 8 years , 6 to 14 years) were not eligible for inclusion in KQ 4 age subgroup analyses. Regarding severity, we operationalized this population characteristic in terms of the chronic and multiple nature of the child 's exposure. Although several studies characterized the study population as \" severely maltreated \" or described families as having multiple reports to Child Protective Services (CPS) or severe parent -to-child violence, further breakdown of the population by severity or analysis of outcomes by degree of severity was not provided. 80,95 In general, reporting of the degree of maltreatment exposure was notably limited in the literature reviewed, a function of researchers having to rely on child welfare or other administrative records and/or parent report (both of which can be difficult to obtain and are subject to inaccuracies and omission) for information about the child' s maltreatment history. Regarding caregiving context, we did not identify eligible trials focused on adoptive parents, either already related or not previously related to the child. We also did not i dentify eligible trials addressing residential or group care, caregivers with mental health or substance abuse problems, or caregiver sociodemographics (e.g., age, sex, race, ethnicity). 109 Table 97.

Child Well -Being and Child Welfare Outcomes in Child Subgroups Age and Other Sociodemographic Subgroups: Early Childhood Key Points Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch U p (ABC): In one trial targeting infants and toddlers (approximately 3 to 39 months of age) and their foster caregivers, ABC resulted in improvements in child mental and behavioral health and caregiver -child relationship outcomes compared with an active control (low SOE for benefit).77-79 In a second trial targeting infants and toddlers (approximately 2 to 21 months of age) and their maltreating parents, ABC again resulted in improvements in child mental and behavioral health and caregiver -child relationship outcomes compared with the active control used in the previous trial (low SOE for benefit). 81-83 A third trial conducted with children in foster care age 0 to 6 years and their foster caregivers, found significant benefit for ABC in improving child mental and behavioral health and caregiver -child relationship outcomes compared with a wait -list control (low SOE of benefit). 80 Attachment -Based Intervention: A randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) targeting infants and toddlers (approximately 1 to 6 years) evaluating an intervention loosely based on ABC and other attachment -focused approaches found improved caregiver -child relationship outcomes in the intervention arm compared with usual care (low SOE of benefit). 86 Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP): The BEIP trial demonstrated numerous benefits for infants and toddlers (age 6 to 30 months) removed fr om institutionalized care and placed in an enhanced foster care intervention compared with children who remained in institutional care. The intervention showed benefit in numerous long- term child mental and behavioral health, caregiver -child relationship, and developmental outcomes. Analysis by age of placement in foster care showed that children placed in foster care earlier were significantly more likely to have an organized attachment compared with children placed later. For secure versus insecure attach ment, children in the enhanced foster care placement before 24 months of age were more likely to have secure attachment than those placed in the foster care condition after 24 months. Time in foster care was also significant, with children being placed for a longer time in the enhanced foster care more likely to have an organized attachment than those placed for a shorter time (low SOE of benefit). 117-129 Child -Parent Psychotherapy (CPP): In two RCTs targeting young children and their maltreating parent (one study targeted 12 -month- old infants; the second study targeted 4- year-old children), a variant of Child- Parent Psychotherapy developed by Cicchetti and colleagues resulted in improved caregiver -child relationship outcomes compared with usual care (low SOE of benefit).87,88 Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care: One RCT with young children (3 to 6 years) found significant benefit of a highly individualized multimodal inte rvention in improving child mental and behavioral health, caregiver -child relationship, healthy development, and positive permanency outcomes (low SOE of benefit).138-144,179 New Orleans Intervention: One nonconcur rent cohort study examined a multimodal intervention that included intensive dyadic psychotherapy with adjudicated (i.e., placed in 111 foster care) infants and young children (age 0 to 4 years) and their biological parents. Referred to as the New Orleans Inte rvention, this study found significantly reduced risk of child recidivism compared with usual care and also with a comparison group of children who were eligible but did not receive the intervention. In addition, the study found that the intervention, compared with usual care, resulted in increased termination of parental rights, decreased reunification, and reduced risk of maternal recidivism with a subsequent child among mothers whose rights had been terminated (low SOE of benefit). 130 SafeCare: In one large -scale effectiveness RCT examining a home- visiting intervention for parents involved with CPS due to neglect, SafeCare resulted in significantly reduced child recidivism (rereports to child welfare) compared with usual care; the benefits of SafeC are were strongest for preschool -age children compared with the full study population, which included children up to 12 years of age (moderate SOE of benefit). 100 Detailed Synthesis We summarize the outcomes and SOE for each study in Table 98.

Age and Other Sociodemographic Subgroups: Sex Key Points Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP): The BEIP trial conducted subgroup analyses by sex. The study found that girls were more likely to have healthy caregiver - child relationship (attachment) outcomes than boys. Additionally, girls in the BEIP condition were more likely than their counterparts remaining in institutional care to have secure attachment and change from an insecure/incompletely formed to secure attachment; however, the study found no differences by intervention group among males (low SOE of benefit). 125,127 Group Psychotherapy for Sexually Abused Girls: One RCT evaluating a group psychotherapy intervention explicitly developed for girls found s uperior long -term benefits in child mental and behavioral health outcomes compared with conventional psychoanalytic therapy; this comparative benefit was sustained at a 2 -year postbaseline followup (low SOE of benefit). 113 Group Treatment Program for Sexual Abuse: One nonrandomized study evaluating a group treatment program with a sample comprising only girls found significant benefit in favor of the intervention for improving mental and behavioral health outcomes compared with wait- list control; the findings must be interpreted with caution in light of the nonrandomized design and very small sample size (low SOE of benefit).114 Detailed Synthesis We summarize the outcomes and SO E for each study that was completed within a subgroup in Table 101.

Type of Maltreatment Exposure: Neglect Key Points Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP): One RCT evaluated an enhanced foster care intervention with infants and young children exposed to social and developmental deprivation in institutional care. The BEIP trial resulted in superior improvements in child mental and behavioral health, caregiver -child relationship, and developmental outcomes compared with usual (institutional) care (low SOE of benefit). 117-129 SafeCare: One large -scale effectiveness RCT evaluated SafeCare, an intervention designed for parents involved with CPS due to neglect. The intervention resulted in significantly reduced child recidivism (rereports to child welfare) compared with usual care. More than a third of the children in each study group had previous histories of physical abuse and of sexual abuse. As n oted previously, the benefits of SafeCare were strongest for preschool -age children compared with the full study population, which included children up to 12 years of age (moderate SOE of benefit). 100 Detailed Synthesis We summarize the outcom es and SOE for each study in Table 102.

Type of Maltreatment Exposure: Sexual Abuse Key Points Group Psychotherapy for Sexually Abused Girls: One RCT assessed the efficacy of a group -based intervention developed specifically to treat sexually abused girls compared with conventional psychoanalytic therapy (active control). The study found the conventional therapy was superior to the group- based approach; as noted previously, this comparative benefit was sustained at a 2- year postbaseline followup (low SOE of greater benefit for active control group ).113 Group Treatment Program for Sexual Abuse: One nonrandomized study evaluated a group treatment program developed for child victims of sexual abuse. The study found significant benefit in favor of the intervention for improving mental and behavioral health outcome s compared with wait -list control; however, as noted previously, the findings must be interpreted with caution in light of the nonrandomized design and very small sample size (low SOE of benefit). 114 Trauma- Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF -CBT): Two RCTs evaluated TF - CBT with sexually abused children, each with a different active control. In both trials, TF-CBT was superior in improving child mental and behavioral health outcomes, including sexualized behavior, and caregiver -child relationship outcomes (low SOE of benefit).108,115 Detailed Synthesis We summarize the outcomes and SOE for each study in Table 104.

Child Welfa re and Child Well -Being Outcomes in Caregiver Subgroups Primary Caregiving Context: Maltreating Parents Key Points Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch U p (ABC): One trial evaluated ABC with biological parents involved with child welfare services and their young children. The study found significantly greater improvements in child mental and behavioral health and caregiver - child relationship outcomes compared with an active control (low SOE for benefit).81-83 Attach ment -Based Intervention: One RCT evaluated an attachment -based intervention with parent -child pairs. Parents were substantially and legally documented for maltreatment, reported for maltreatment by a community organization, or self -reported the child 's mal treatment exposure. The study found improved caregiver -child relationship outcomes in the intervention arm compared with usual care (low SOE of benefit).86 Child -Parent Psychotherapy (CPP): In two RCTs with maltre ating parents and their young children, a variant of Child- Parent Psychotherapy developed by Cicchetti and colleagues resulted in improved caregiver -child relationship outcomes compared with usual care (low SOE of benefit).87,88 119 Combined Parent -Child Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CPC -CBT): One RCT evaluating CPC- CBT with physically abusive parents and their children found greater improvements in child mental and behavioral health outcomes compared with an inactive c ontrol; as noted previously, the short -term outcomes faded by 3 -month postintervention followup (low SOE of benefit).107 New Orleans Intervention: One nonconcurrent cohort study evaluated the New Orleans Intervent ion with adjudicated infants and young children (i.e., in foster care) and their biological parents. This study found significantly reduced risk of child recidivism compared with usual care and also with a comparison group of children who were eligible but did not receive the intervention. As noted previously, the study also found that the intervention, compared with usual care, resulted in increased termination of parental rights, decreased reunification, and reduced risk of maternal recidivism with a subsequent child among mothers whose rights had been terminated (low SOE of benefit). 130 Parent -Child Interaction Therapy Adaptation Package (PCIT -AP): One RCT (efficacy trial) evaluating an adaptation of PCIT for physically abusive parents and their children, which included a motivational interviewing orientation, found significantly reduced child recidivism (median follow -up time 850 days postbaseline) in favor of the intervention; 96 a trend towards this effect was found in a subsequent effectiveness trial that targeting parents referred for services by child welfare for neglect and/or physical abuse (low SOE of benefit).95 SafeCare: One large -scale effectiveness RCT evaluated SafeCare, an intervention designed for parents involved with CPS due to neglect. The intervention resulted in significantly reduced child recidivism (rereports to child welfare) compared with usual care. As noted previously, the benefits of SafeCare were strongest for preschool -age children compared with the full study population, which included children up to 12 years of age (moderate SOE of benefit). 100 Detailed Synthesis We summarize the outcomes and SOE for each study in Table 106.

Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions With Children Exposed to Maltreatment for Engaging Children and/or Caregivers in Treatment Organization This section takes the same organizational approach as that followed in key question ( KQ) 1 and KQ 2. However, we identified a single intervention for inclusion in this KQ. We remind the reader that benefit is denoted in the results tables using a greater ( \">\") sign (e.g., Group 1 > Group 2) and that within- group changes are denoted as im provement ( \"\"), or nonsignificant change ( \"ns\") for studies that provided these data. Description of Included Studies We present the results of one trial (two articles) ( Table 108)95,97 that assessed the effectiveness of an intervention for engaging participants in treatment and treatment retention. Table 108. Number of trials and articles investigating treatment engagement or retention Intervention Trials Motivational Intervention 1a Total 1 aReported in two article s. Motivational Intervention We identified one large effectiveness randomized controlled trial ( RCT ), reported in two articles, evaluating a motivational orientation intervention designed to improve parenting program retention compared with a community st andard orientation provided by the child welfare agency (Table 109) .95,97 In a previous efficacy trial,96 the authors describe the intervention as a self -motivational inter vention (MI) orientation comprising six clinic -based group sessions and employ ing a variety of motivational strategies including testimonials from parents who completed the Parent -Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) adaptation, decisional 123 exercises weighing t he pros and cons of harsh physical discipline and of change, encouraging parents to develop their own list of parenting and parent -child relationship goals, elaborating discrepancy between current parent -child interactional patterns and personalized goals, and encouraging the parents ' commitment to change. The standard orientation comprised six sessions and was primarily informational and educational. Topics addressed in the standard orientation included the roles of child welfare and of the service provide r organization, definitions of child maltreatment and how it affects children, and information about the possible insight -oriented links between a parent 's own childhood experiences and current parenting practices.

Abbreviations: G = group; MI = motivational orientation intervention; PCIT -AP = Parent -Child Interaction Therapy Adaptation Package (i.e., PCIT combined with motivational orientation); RCT = randomized controlled trial; SAU = servic es as usual (community standard orientation + parenting program). In an initial article reporting on the results of the subsequent effectiveness trial, Chaffin and colleagues97 compare the MI with the community sta ndard orientation, combined with either PCIT or the community standard didactic parenting program. In a subsequent article,95 the authors examine the relative effects of PCIT and the MI by contrasting varying combi nations of experimental and usual care service components. Refer to the results for KQ 2 for the Parent - Child Interaction Therapy Adaptation Package for more detail about the study arms. Key Points Treatment engagement: In one large effectiveness trial, m altreating parents who participated in the MI orientation reported greater readiness for change and other positive self-motivational outcomes compared with parents who participated in a standard orientation (moderate strength of evidence [SOE] ).95,97 Treatment retention : In one large effectiveness trial, maltreating parents who participated in PCIT combined with the MI orientation had higher treatment completion rates compared with parents who participated in a standard orientation combined with PCIT (moderate SOE )97 (Table 81). 124 Detailed Synthesis Table 110 presents the results of the MI trial;95,97 additional study details are provid ed in the evidence tables (Appendix E). The authors first randomized participants either to the MI orientation or to the standard orientation conditions . In the first article,97 Chaffin and colleagues assess partic ipants ' readiness for change upon completion of their respective orientations. Parents who participated in the MI orientation had consistently greater improvements on the overall readiness scale and on the \" readiness to change \" and \" attitude toward the pro gram \" subscales compared with those in the standard orientation. Participants were then randomized a second t ime to receive either PCIT or the standard parenting program. The PCIT and standard parenting program s had a comparable number of sessions. The study found higher treatment completion rates among participants who received PCIT combined with the MI orientation compared with participants who received any of the other conditions: (a) the MI condition combined with the community standard parenting progra m, (b) the standard orientation in conjunction with PCIT, or (c) the services as usual (standard orientation combined with standard parenting program). In the second article the authors again compared participants ' readiness for change across study arms an d provide an effect size. 95 Though participants in both orientation conditions reported increased readiness for change, caregivers who participated in the MI orientation reported greater improvements in readiness f or change.

Key Question 6. Adverse Events Associated With Interventions for Children Exposed to Maltreatment Organization This section takes the same organizational approach as that followed in key question ( KQ) 1 and KQ 2. However, we identified a single intervention for inclusion in this KQ. Description of Included Studies We require studies to report active surveillance of harms to be included in KQ 6. Only one study met inclusion criteria for KQ 6 (Table 11 2). Since this comparative evidence review ( CER ) focuses on a particularly vulnerable population, we also describe what appear to be spontaneously reported adverse events; however, we do not grade the strength of evidence (SOE) for thes e outcomes. Table 112. Number of trials and articles investigating adverse events Parenting Interventions Trials Trauma -Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy115 1 Total 1 Active Surveillance of Harms ( Included in KQ 6) Trauma -Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Key Points Adverse events: Compared with an active (derived) comparator, a greater number of children in the comparative condition experienced remov al from treatment because of their persistent sexu ally inappropriate behavior involving another child or adult (low SOE ). 126 Detailed Synthesis Only one study reported active surveillance of adverse events; this trial compared TF -CBT with nondirective supportive therapy.115 Specifically, the study assessed the incidence of sexually inappropriate behavior that involved another child or adult. During the trial, Cohen and colleagues report that 6 of the 28 children in nondirective supportive therap y and 0 of the 39 children in TF -CBT persistently exhibited such behavior and required removal from treatment. We rate the SOE for the comparative harms of these two interventions as low ( Table 113) as fewer children in the TF -CBT group experienced the adverse event of removal from treatment. Table 113.

Spontaneous Reporting of Adverse Events Parent -Child Interaction Therapy Adaptation Key Points None. This study does not meet KQ 6 inclusion criteria . Detailed Synthesis Because this CER focuses on a particularly vulnerable population, we also report here any instance of adverse events described by study authors. We do not rate the SOE for this outcome because it did not meet our inclusion criteria for this KQ ; that is , the article does not report active surveillance of adverse events. In a tr ial comparing a PCIT Adaptation Package with usual care,95,97 the authors described an instance of an adverse event but did not describe their method of monitoring adverse events. In the study, a participant whose child was in foster care requested to be removed from the PCIT condition because of difficulties separating from the child after dyadic sessions. The authors did not report any such instances for the other treatment groups. 127 Discussion This chapter summa rizes key findings and strength of evidence (SOE) for each key question (KQ), followed by a section on the applicability of the findings, a summary of the limitations of the comparative rev iew process, limitations of the evidence base, and gaps in the evidence that may benefit from future research. Key Findings and Strength of Evidence Overview Overall, the evidence from 2 4 trials (2 3 randomized and 1 nonrandomized controlled trial) and one cohort study (reported in 53 articles) included in this comparative effectiveness review (CER) provides preliminary support for a number of promising approaches for addressing child exposure to maltreatment. We categorized the array of interventions in the literature as parenting interventions, trauma -focused treatments, or enhanced foster care intervention approaches. Within and across these intervention types, approaches varied in treatment target, intensity, modality, and theoretical conceptualizations of therapeutic change. Most studies identified for this review w ere conducted in the United States and evaluated parenting interventions. In contrast, comparative studies of trauma -focused treatments were sparse, with three of seven trials focused on one intervention or an adaptation of that intervention. 108,115,116 Our review also included five trials of en hanced foster care interventions; these approaches all were directed at the child \u2014either alone or in combination with a caregiver component. With the exception of two interventio ns, KEEP and SafeCare, the body of evidence for interventions that addressed child well-being or child welfare outcomes in maltreated children was predominantly low strength of evidence or was insufficient to draw firm conclusions. We acknowledge that the inclusion criterion of children with known CPS involvement or maltreatment may be considered a rarified approach by some. We recognize, as well, that this decision may have resulted in the exclusion of trials that, arguably, might bolster evidence for included interventions or support inclusion of other interventions with at least low strength of evidence. Our intent was threefold: ( 1) to reduce the noise of clinical heterogeneity that currently undermines the extant evidence base, ( 2) to maintain the rigo rous approach for study inclusion that has been employed across AHRQ CERs, and (3) to avert yet more heterogeneity due to inconsistent, vague, or absent definitions of samples of children defined as ' at risk ' or an admixture of ' at risk ' and maltreated. As we attempted to follow these principles, we have striven for clarity about our decisions in order to better inform readers. With these perspectives in mind, we believe that this review makes a groundbreaking contribution to the field that challenges resea rchers, clinicians, and policymakers. Given the apriori exclusions, our review illuminates major substantive and methodological gaps in the evidence and highlights critical areas for future research. To be fair, these gaps reflect the relatively new field of evidence -based mental health treatment provided in the context of the myriad and complex challenges of caring for maltreated children, engaging and retaining maltreating parents in treatment, and working within the parameters of the child welfare arena. Head -to-head studies are scarce, as are multiple or independent (i.e., tested by researchers unaffiliated with intervention developers) trials. Sample sizes are commonly very small. A gap in the literature with implications for widespread implementation is the issue of \" dose\" or how much of an intervention is needed to e ffect change. None of the included studies addressed this 128 issue. With the exception of studies involving younger children, few interventions were designed for or studied efficacy or effecti veness within specific age or developmental ranges. Similarly, studies rarely took into consideration or elucidated findings as they related to maltreatment type, severity, chronicity, timing, and exposure to other traumatic experiences. Also underrepresented in the literature were intervention studies explicitly evaluating efficacy or effectiveness with the most vulnerable and challenging -to-serve families , that is, maltreated children whose biological parents were struggling with substance abuse, mental health problems, or domestic violence. In some instances, such families were intentionally excluded from a study sample. Key Question 1 . Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions for Improving Child Well -Being Outcomes The summary of results for KQ 1 is presented in Table11 4. For KQ 1, we proposed four sets of outcomes representing key dimensions of child well -being: child mental and behavioral health, the quality of the caregiver -child relationship (e.g., child attachment , caregiver tivity , positive parental attitudes toward childrearing), children 's development (e.g., cognition, language, physical maturation ), and school -based functioning (e.g., grade retention, disciplinary referrals, attendance). Only three trials reported developm ental outcomes, and we identified no studies eligible for inclusion that as sessed school -based functioning. T he body of evidence for interventions that addressed child well -being in maltreated children was predominantly low SOE or was insufficient to draw firm conclusions . As specified in the results section, low SOE was attributable to the presence of a small number of distinct trials; in some cases, the SOE also took into account inconsistent findings across outcomes, imprecise or nonstatistically signifi cant results, and/or samples that resulted in underpowered analyses. The low SOE ratings represent an important limitation of the extant research and call into question the replicability and generalizability of results. At the same time, the ratings should be considered in light of the emerging status of this line of research and noteworthy barriers to the rigorous study of interventions for maltreated children. Of the 21 eligible trials for this KQ, the vast majority provided evidence for different interv entions with most bodies of evidence consisting of only one trial , many with very small sample sizes . Among the 19 trials assessing children 's mental and behavioral health , 14 trials resulted in statistically significant between -group differences in one or more measures. A moderate SOE grade was applied for only one intervention, KEEP, which was assessed in a large effectiveness trial . Only two interventions were tested in more than 1 trial (both graded as low SOE ): Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch Up 77-83,85 and Trauma -Focused Cognitive - Behavioral Therapy.108,115 Regarding healthy caregiver -child relationship outcomes, 11 of the 16 trials assessing relevant outcomes result ed in statistically significant between -group differences on one or more measures. A moderate SOE grade was applied only to KEEP, which was assessed in a large effectiveness trial. Studies predominantly assessed caregiver behavior changes via parent self - report measures or subscales of measures, which reflected varying degrees of established validity. This heterogeneity of measurement made it difficult to generalize findings across studies for the caregiver -child relationship outcomes. 129 Table 114.

Abbreviations: G = group; HR = hazard ratio; KQ = key question; n = number; NR = not reported; OR = odds ratio; RRR = relative risk reduction . Of the three trials that assessed developmental outcomes , two assessed enhanced foster care interventions that applied specific strategies designed to promote children' s development.117,119,121,122,124,126,128,139,141 For example, children participating in Multidimensio nal Foster Care for Preschoolers received services from a behavioral specialist working in preschool , child care, and home -based settings.140 The third study, which reported cognitive processes as outcomes, was examining the efficacy of Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch U p.85 We found no eligible studies that assessed school -based functioning , an anomaly given the pervasive emphasis on school readiness and performance in the U.S. educational system . Key Question 2. Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions for Improving Child Welfare Outcomes The summary of results for KQ 2 is also presented in Table 114. The outcomes for KQ 2 pertain to indicators particular to the child welfare system: safety (i.e., maltreatment recurrence), placement stability over time , and permanency (e.g., positive permanency arrangements such as reunification with the parent or adoption by the biological parent or another relative). The evidence for child welfare outcomes is relatively spa rse compared with the research providing evidence on child well -being outcomes (KQ 1). One caveat is that this paucity of studies likely reflects our exclusion of (a) s ystem -level interventions, such as differential response or systems - integration approaches, that have a central premise of improving child welfare status and (b) youth more than 14 years of age, because intervention research in the child welfare arena commonly targets families involved with Child Protective Services ( CPS) regardless of the child's age or focuses specifically on adolescents. Of the nine eligible trials reviewed for this KQ, five investigated the efficacy or effectiveness of parenting interventions , and four examined enhanced foster care interventions for safety, placement stab ility, or permanency outcomes. Four trials were not among those included in the results for KQ 1: t hree pertain ed to parenting interventions (Parent -Child Interaction Therapy [PCIT] that integrates a Motivational Intervention and SafeCare 95,96,100 and one pertain ed to an enhanced foster care intervention (New Orleans Intervention).130 All other trials included in KQ 2 evaluated interventions that were also reviewed under KQ 1.92,93,132,140,143,144 The studies analyzed for KQ 2 include two large effectiveness trials92,100, one smaller effectiveness trial,95 and one nonconcurrent c ohort study .130 The included studies target ed (1) maltreating families to prevent maltreatment recurrence93,95,96,100,130 or (2) foster parents to promote placement stability and positive permanency outcomes .92,140,143,144 We found moderate SOE for one intervention that address ed child safety with maltreating parents. Based on the results of a large effectiveness RCT, the SafeCare home- visiting intervention res ulted in lower rates of child maltreatment recidivism compared with usual care.100 Results of a smaller effectiveness trial with maltreating parents that assessed safety outcomes for an adaptation of PCIT combined with a motivational intervent ion (referred to here as an adaptation package or PCIT -AP) showed a trend toward benefit in favor of the intervention over usual care consistent with findings from a previous efficacy trial of the same intervention. 95,96 Additionally, PCIT -AP was more efficacious in reducing maltreatment 132 recurrence than an enhanced version that included individual services for the parent along with home visiting to support parenting behaviors learned in the clinical sessions. Another large effectiveness trial focused on improved placement and permanency outcomes for children in foster care. This brief parent training intervention, known as Keeping Foster and Kinship Parents Trained and Supported (KEEP), resulted in improved permanency outcomes (e.g., reunification or adoption by a relative).92 Although there was insufficient evidence regarding the benefit of KEEP in reducing the risk of placement disruption (negative exits), the study found that the intervention mitigated the risk of placement changes associated with multiple previous placements. The KEEP trial offers moderate strength of evidence that a low - intensity approach can effectively promote positive permanency outcomes. Several ot her interventions included in KQ 2 resulted in significant benefit compared with usual care, although the strength of the evidence was graded as low because of single trials. Two interventions with older children showed benefit in increasing placement stability and/or positive permanency outcomes. Fostering Healthy Futures, a high- intensity approach and the only child- focused intervention reviewed in KQ 2, resulted in fewer placement changes and increased permanency for youth ages 9 to 11 living in nonrelat ive foster care, increased reunification rates, and fewer placements in residential treatment center. 132 Middle School Success, which targeted girls ages 10 to 12, also showed a significant benefit for reduced placement changes and also for decreased marijuana use, a major risk factor for placement change. A high -intensity intervention for young children, Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Preschoolers (MTFC -P), also showed benefit for positive permanency outcomes, measured in various ways: compared with usual care, MTFC -P resulted in fewer permanent placement failures, a greater proportion of attempts at permanent placement resulting in successful placement, and a greater proportion of cases resulting in permanent placement compared with usual care. However, no benefit was found for MTFC -P in number of placement disruptions or time in foster care prior to placement disruption. 92,140,143,144 Another multimodal approach, referred to as the New Orleans Intervention, resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of child recidivism among infants and toddlers in CPS custody and placed in foster care. This study also found reduced risk of maternal recidivism for subsequent children among mothers whose parental rights were terminated. This intensive and individualized approach increased termination of parental rights and decreased reunification between the child and his or her biological caregiver. The study authors suggested that the increased scrutiny afforded by the inten sive intervention may have contributed to these permanency outcomes. Ideally, a positive outcome for adjudicated children involves reunification with a rehabilitated parent wherein the risks to safety and child well -being have been effectively mitigated th rough intervention. However, the termination of parental rights may have been a de facto protective outcome for this vulnerable population of maltreated, foster care children . We found insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness o f a home visiting intervention in promoting child welfare outcomes. The approach was derived from an existing intervention that had been developed originally as a preventive approach (i.e., an intervention that was not designed to prevent maltreatment recu rrence in families where abuse or neglect had already occurred). Although maltreated children and those at risk for maltreatment have similar risk profiles, these findings suggest there may be important distinctions not yet fully understood in terms of cli nical need. 133 Key Question 3. Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions With Different Characteristics Several treatment characteristics were identified a priori for this KQ: modality (i.e., service delivery format), theoretical orientation, and type of ser vice delivery setting. W e found three trials relevant to KQ 3, all included comparisons that pertained to theoretical orientation.77-79,81 - 83,85,108 We found no studies that compared the efficacy or effectiveness o f interventions delivered in different settings. We also found no studies in which the design or methods clearly indicated that modality (i.e., service delivery format) was a comparison of interest , and our team carefully avoided excessive interpretation to make a study \" fit\" with this KQ . We were able to identify two interventions for which the theoretical orientation was clearly differentiated across experimental and control conditions. Meaningful contrasts were elusive due to the eclectic nature of the i nterventions we reviewed, with the majority of interventions dra wn from multiple o r unspecified theoretical bases , and minimal discussion of the therapeutic underpinnings by study authors. In cases where the comparator was a derived approach, it was diffic ult to ascertain the degree to which the original model 's theoretical orientation was maintained or implemented. For example, the CPP studies reported using a nurse home visitation model that has been described by the intervention developer as aiming to enhance early attachment among its other intervention targets. 192 Our a priori focus on theoretical orientation did not intentionally aim to elevate treatments with a unifying theory over multiply determined approaches; yet it was difficult to interpret results comparing eclectic approaches . Taken together, t hese many challenges resulted in our including only two interventions in KQ 3: Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch U p (ABC) compared with a didactic, nonrelationship- based approach and Trauma -Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF -CBT) compared with psychodynamic child -centered treatment. The trials all showed benefit in favor of the experimental intervention 's theoretical approach. However, it should be noted that the comparator in the case of the ABC trials was not a bona fide alternative therapy designed to address child attachment or child emotional well- being but a derived approach that targeted only developmental skills (e.g., cognitive, language). The intervention characteristics specified for KQ 3 were identified a priori following the approach of previous systematic reviews conducted by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence -based Practice Centers. They were selected because of their cost and treatment implications and to build on previous systematic reviews with maltreated children that examined intervention effectiveness by therapy type. 145,146,182 However, the difficult y we encountered in carrying out KQ 3, namely the paucity of relevant contrasts, suggest s a need for a qualitative analysis of the literature to identify treatment characteristics that are relevant to and useful for the field. Although an ad hoc analysis was beyond the scope of this review , through our immersion in this literature we noted the distinction between and unequal attention paid to specific techniques (e.g., intervention- specific strategies and content) in relation to factors that may be common across interventions at the leve l of client- therapist interactions (e.g., therapeutic relationship, personal characteristics of therapist and patient , engagement ). The latter may be essential to understanding treatment efficacy or effectiveness . 183-185 Thus, explicitly attending to differentiating and common treatment characteristics in the scientific literature is one important area for future research . 134 Key Question 4. Comparison of Intervention Effectiveness for Improving Child Well -Being or Chi ld Welfare Outcomes in Population Subgroups KQ 4 summarized the comparative effectiveness of interventions for different child and caregiver subgroups. All trials analyzed for this KQ were also examined in either or both KQ 1 and KQ 2. Table 115 presents the summary of results for KQ 4. The table presents the SOE and also indicates with which subgroup population(s) the intervention was evaluated; many interventions pertained to multiple subgroups. Table 115.

For caregiver subgroups, we s ummarize d the evidence for children and their maltreating parents and children and the foster or kinship parent s. No studies eligible for inclusi on focused on children in residential care or children who had been adopted from foster care . We a priori had identified other salient child and caregiver characteristics as subgroups to examine; however, we identified no eligible studies for these additio nal areas : (a) caregiver mental health problems, substance abuse, domestic violence, and sociodemographic subpopulations and (b) severity of maltreatment and children with special needs (e.g., prenatal substance exposure). It was particularly notable that we could not identify studies for inclusion in this KQ that attended to race or ethnicity, given the attention to disproportionality in the child welfare arena. We also did not find any eligible studies that explicitly focused on these subgroups or stratif ied findings by these subgroups, so they are not represented in the results for KQ 4. A n umber of studies excluded parents with active substance abuse or mental illness and children with documented developmental disabilities. In sum, the results for KQ 4 provide readers with a roadmap listing interventions for different subgroups for which there is comparative effectiveness research showing low or moderate SOE. These results also point out the substantive gaps in the existing evidence base for addressing t he question for what child and/or caregiver characteristics do interventions have impact or the most impact ? This gap largely reflects the paucity of studies that could identify moderators or treatment response due to small sample sizes. Key Question 5. C omparative Effectiveness of Interventions With Children Exposed to Maltreatment for Engaging Children and/or Caregivers in Treatment We identified three trials in the literature relevant to KQ 5, which assessed the comparative effectiveness of a motivation al intervention designed to increase maltreating parents ' engage ment and retention in a parenting intervention . The motivational intervention was a 6- week group -based motivational orientation to parenting services for families referred by CPS for maltreatment. The researchers compared PCIT combined with either the motivational intervention or service- as-usual CPS orientation for maltreating families referred for parenting services (see description of study design in the Results KQ 2 and KQ 5 ). The PCIT pac kage that incorporated the motivational intervention yielded better parental treatment engagement relative to those assigned to receive PCIT with the standard CPS orientation. The strength of evidence for the motivational intervention was graded as moderat e. In addition, PCIT plus the motivational intervention yielded improved treatment retention outcomes compared with PCIT plus the usual 137 CPS orientation. These findings are notable in light of the paucity of comparative research on participant engagement an d retention. Key Question 6. Adverse Events Associated With Interventions for Children Exposed to Maltreatment We included a KQ examining adverse events because there is the potential for harms, even temporary, associated with treatment of children expose d to maltreatment. Such harms ma y take the form of retraumatization associated with gradual exposure or caregiver distress resulting from an increased awareness of the harm to a child exposed to abuse and neglect experiences. Only two trials reported an incident that the authors classified as an adverse event. Of those trials, only one reported active surveillance of adverse events, which was an inclusion criterion for KQ 6. This trial assessed the comparative efficacy of TF -CBT and nondirective supportive therapy (active control) for sexually -abused preschoolers . Fewer children in TF -CBT experienced the adverse event of removal from treatment because of p ersistent sexually inappropriate behavior involving another child or adult (low SOE). Findings in Relati onship to What Is Already Known This review contributes to the literature by providing a comprehensive assessment of the range of interventions that have been evaluated for children exposed to maltreatment and who live in different caregiving and custodial contexts (i.e., with a maltreating parent, in formal or informal foster or kinship care ). To the extent possible, we analyzed the efficacy or effectiveness of interventions for different child and caregiver subgroups in KQ 4 (as described above). Some reviews have limited their purview to specific interventions, to children exposed to specific types of maltreatment, or to other specific subgroups. For example, a 2007 Cochrane review examined the effects of cognitive behavioral training for foster parents i n managing challenging child behavior. 147 Another review reported on the effectiveness of family therapy for children who had been physical ly abuse d.186 Other reviews limited to particular intervention types or subgroups include a meta- analysis of the effectiveness of psychotherapy with sexually abused children,145 a meta -analysis of paren t training programs,146 and a review of psychotherapeutic interventions with children in foster care.187 Each contributes to knowledge and understanding of segments of this field, yet none attempt to examine a broader range of maltreated children, caregivers, interventions, and types of outcomes. This review includes a comprehensive and developmentally informed set of child well -being outcomes. For example, we assessed careg iver-child relationship, developmental, and school - based functioning outcomes in addition to child mental and behavioral health outcomes. Our treatment of parenting ideations and behaviors as indicators of the caregiver -child relationship rather than \"parent -level risk factors \" emphasizes the transactional nature of a child 's development in the context of the caregiving environment. 188 We believe this is the first systematic review guided explicitly by such developmental consideration. Overall, the findings presented in this report do not contradict but expand on and extend previously published findings. By follow ing the rigorous and transparent CER methods of AHRQ' s Effective Health Care ( EHC ) program, our report provides a comprehensive assessment of the limitations of the evidence base and critical research, clinical, and policy issues that must be addressed to move the field forward. 138 Applicability As noted, during the review process we systematically abstracted key factors that may affect the applicability of the evidence base. We identified these key factors a priori, using as our guidepost the definition of applicability provided by the AHRQ EHC program that defines applicability as \"the extent to which the effects observed in published studies are likely to reflect the expected results when a specific intervention is applied to the population of interest under real-world conditions.\" We explicitly sought to identify facto rs that related to each element of the population, interventions, comparators, outcomes, timing, and settings (PICOTS ) framework that was used to guide the review. We present below the major is sues that emerged from our analysis of factors affecting the applicability of the evidence base. Population The findings from this review must be understood in the context of treatment that occurs in recognition of the potential traumatogenic nature of ma ltreatment exposure, which begins from a different perspective than treatment in response to clinical symptoms and impairment. Accordingly, t he evidence base primarily reflects two related contingents of maltreated children: those for whom child welfare involvement or custody represents a proxy for maltreatment and those for whom maltreatment is concluded based on clinical assessment. Each of the two approaches is subject to false negative conclusions, but at a broad level they together reflect the target p opulation of children exposed to maltreatment. Among the studies evaluating parenting interventions with maltreating parents, exclusion criteria may have affected the applicability of the findings in important ways. These exclusion criteria encompass paren ts unwilling to participate in the intervention and study, parents with active substance use or abuse, parents with psychiatric impairment (e.g., severe depression, psychosis) , and parents affected by a cognitive or neurological disability. Because these p opulation characteristics represent baseline risks that are prevalent in the target population, 51 particularly maternal depression,189,190 the applicability of the evidence to the complex presentations encounter ed in clinical settings is somewhat limited. Intervention The evidence base reflects the diverse range of interv ention approaches in the field, which vary considerably in intensity. Those interventions with lower intensity ( < 12 weekly sessions or approxi mately 3 months in duration) or moderate intensity (13 to 24 weekly sessions or approximately 6 months in duration) may fit well with the structural needs and expectations encountered in child welfare systems operating under the strict timeline set for per manency planning under the Adoption and Safe Families Act. 191 The majority of studies delivered the intervention of interest under conditions more favorable than encountered in community settings. The discrepancy appeared most salient in terms of provider qualifications, as those in the experimental conditions tended to receive spec ialized training and close supervision from a highly specialized clinician , often the intervention developer . The interventions analyzed in the results all indicated that a manual was available. However, the interventions appear to vary considerably in the degree to which they attend to issues critical to effective implementation, particularly as relates to fidelity measurement and maintenance. 139 Comparators Many the comparisons in the evidence base evaluated the efficacy or effectiveness of the intervention against an active control. Of these, 36 percent represented conventional practices in the field and 64 percent represented approaches that were derivations of other approaches.The derived approaches made assessment of applicability difficult because it was not clear whether they reflected the best alternative treatments in the field. On the contrary, in several cases the comparator was a modified version of an original model for which evidence of effectiveness exists in the scientific literature or did not appear to maintain core components of the original model with fidelity (the case in five trials ). 77-79,81 -83,85,87,88,112 The derived approaches also included two that were developed to control for nonspecific aspe cts of the experimental intervention. As newly developed interventions, the extent to which each represented a \" best\" alternative treatment could not be determined. Outcomes The evidence base for the efficacy or effectiveness of parenting interventions in changing parenting behavior associated with maltreatment is limited by the reliance on parent self -report measures of behavioral or attitudinal change, often using only subscales of measures or measures with weak evidence of their validity to the study population. Although parent self -reports of parenting practices are important indices of the quality of the caregiver -child relationship and the risk of maltreatment recurrence, measurement of actual behavior change would strengthen the evidence of benefits. Few parenting interventions with maltreating parents used an objective , observational measure of child attachment to measure change in the caregiver -child relationship. The most widely used and validated measure of attachment between a child and his or he r parent (or primary caregiver) is a structured procedure in which the child experiences separations from and reunions with the parent that represent laboratory analogues of normative parent -child separations . 181 This laboratory -based procedure, known a s the \" Strange Situation, \" is the \"measure of first choice for examining attachment intervention outcomes.\"192 However, the validity of this measure has not been established for the foster care context, because a child i n foster care may have been in a placement too briefly or experienced such disruption that a primary caregiving relationship with the foster parent would be premature at best . These measurement issues related to the caregiver -child relationship undermine t he applicability of the evidence to the target population. In contrast, child mental and behavioral health outcomes, as assessed across the different types of interventions included in this review, were based on a narrow set of measures with established va lidity for the target population. However, very few studies used child report. 107,131 The child welfare outcomes reported in the included studies were based on data drawn primarily from child welfare agency records . This approach may offer important insights into the integration of treatment into child welfare systems but only to the extent that records objectively, accurately, and consistently report the relevant variables within a system and across regions and states. The duration of follow up to assess maltreatment recurrence (i.e., safety) was variable across studies, making it somewhat difficult to apply the findings to the already complex recurrence data in the State Child and Family Service Reviews (the data u sed by the Federal Government to monitor State child welfare programs in meeting safety, permanency, and family and child well -being outcomes). 140 The majority of studies included in KQ 1, regardless of intervention type, collected outcomes only at postintervention. When present, f ollow -up assessments rarely extended beyond 3 to 6 months after the intervention ended. Both short - and long -term improvements have important applicability to maltreated children, particularly children at risk for out -of-home placement and parents at risk of losing custody or parental rights unless the actions that brought their case to the attention of the child welfare system are addressed. For KQ 2, safety outcomes spanned much greater periods of time, although there was considerable variability in time to followup across studies assessing child recidivism. Setting Many of the studies were conducted in university - or community -based clinics, including organizations providing services for the child welfare system. Thus , they are gene rally, but not wholly, representative of the settings in which interventions are delivered in the field. The studies were predominantly conducted in the United States. Four studies were conducted in other Western countries: two in Canada and one in the Uni ted Kingdom. Although these other settings were also Western countries, differences in child welfare systems and health service systems may affect the applicability of the study findings. One study was conducted in Iran, and another other in Romania. The e vidence from these latter studies is less broadly applicable, despite offering perspectives on caring for maltreated children in low - and middle -income countries and potentially informing intervention in appreciably underresourced areas . Limitations of the Comparative Effectiveness Review Our review required that included studies be of at least medium or low risk of bias and include comparators and pairwise comparisons as a basis for conclusions regarding effectiveness. The decision to emphasize certain asp ects of study design resulted in the exclusion of evaluations of ongoing, highly adaptable programs that are widely used in the field but come with limited empirical support. This review did not limit interventions based on the ready availability of a manu al or training to support effective implementation, although all of the studies included in the results referred to a manual or treatment program. Another limitation of the review relates to the issue of heterogeneity. A key tenet of an AHRQ review involve s the effort to restrict sample heterogeneity in favor of generalizability. Our efforts in this regard resulted in exclusions that admittedly may have come at the cost of a more representative review. However, each exclusion decision was made with the inte ntion of focusing the review and controlling for important sources of heterogeneity. For example, youth older than 14 years of age were excluded. We recognize that the decis ion to exclude older adolescents meant excluding a large body of evidence about widely used and well -respected interventions, such as , Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care, 193,194 Multisystemic Therapy for Child Abuse and Neglect,195,196 and the Sanctuary Model\u00ae.197,198 Although clearly a relevant population, the nature of adolescent development (e.g., increases in autonomy, independence, physical maturity) and the nature of caregiving during this period undergo significant changes and evolution. With some variation, maltreatment rates decrease with children 's age with the highest rates among infants. Although rates tend to increase during early adolescence relative to elementary school years, they revert to their decline during mid -adolescence. We imposed the age cutoff in recognition of how maltreatment and its sequelae evolve across the development spectrum and shift in frequency as youth age . 141 Other exclusions pertained to type of intervention. We excluded evaluations of primary or secondary prevention, namely studies where maltreatment was not indicated or substantiated , families had no evident current involvement with CPS, or the description of the study population was too vague for a determination about maltreatment. However, despite this exclusion, the review encompasses an array of interventions that span a broad spectrum of development that includes infancy, early childhood, school age, and early adolescence. Systems -level interventions likewise were excluded to focus on more \"clinical level \" approaches at the child, parent, and family levels. Understanding how systems can effectively respond to maltreatment and how interventions can be effectively implemented within these complex systems is critically important. Systems approaches, such as differential response and solution- focused casework, are well accepted and widely used within child welfare and affect the work of related care systems. At the same time, these approaches and their evaluations were so diverse that they warranted a separate review. Finally, perhaps the most difficult exclusion decision for this review pertained to children exposed to domestic violence. The exclusion was made in the interest of reducing clinical heterogeneity and also out of concern about the potential for readers to conflate domestic violence and maltreatment if they were combined in a single review. Despite the high concordance of domestic violence with physical and sexual abuse, emotional victimi zation, and neglect , the experience of witnessing domestic violence relative to that of being a direct victim of caregiver maltreatment may vary . Further, m any jurisdictions classify exposure to domestic violence as distinct from maltreatment. Even with t hese exclusions, we strongly acknowledge that t his review encompasses a notably heterogeneous population with widely varying need for intervention. W e were unable to account for the inherent clinical heterogeneity in the population of maltreated children whether in community or child welfare and foster care settings. Approximately 20 percent of children in foster care are removed from the home for reasons other than abuse or neglect . Reasons may involve exposure to risk rather than direct victimization of t he child (e.g., prenatal drug exposure, parental substance abuse, domestic violence, unconfirmed maltreatment but in need of services). 51 Limitations of the Evidence Base This review applie d stringent evidentiary standards to the still relatively new f ield of evidence -based mental health treatment for maltreated children whose backgrounds of victimization, ambivalence toward maltreating parents or caregivers, complex symptoms and functional impairments, and disruptions in care present extreme challenges to traditional research. We did not pursue a quantitative meta -analysis for this review because of the diversity in interventions , comparators, and outcomes measured in the literature . Specific limitations we encountered are described below. Study Design and Methodology Several issues related to design and methodology hampered the comparative review process. At a broad level, studies rarely distinguished themselves as either efficacy or effectiveness trials. This speaks to a serious issue in the field that contributes to variability in definitions of evidence - based practice and understanding of when practices are ready for dissemination.199 At the level of intervention, studies infrequently undertook head- to-head co mparisons with named active treatments ; also , studies that used a usual -care comparator varied widely in the definition and 142 content of usual care. Regarding the former limitation, o ur systematic review found several instances where comparators were derived from commonly used interventions that included variations specific to the setting or the study. Overall, the active control treatments var ied widely within and across studies and often lacked a clear treatment rationale and specificity about procedures. S uch variations, particularly when unlabeled and untested for efficacy, make it difficult to arrive at conclusions regarding comparative effectiveness. Regarding \" usual care\" or \"services as usual \" as the control intervention, which was the case for the maj ority of studies reviewed, there is n o standard for this type of control group in the field. Thus, usual care as the control represented a problematic comparator insofar as it is an ill -defined concept. Studies either lack ed or fail ed to report power anal yses. Because the evidence base features many small studies, this omission hampered our ability to assess whether the absence of effect reflected lack of effectiveness or insufficient statistical power. The vulnerability of the population increases the urgency of the need to identify effective interventions (and weed out ineffective interventions). Adequately powered studies, coupled with clear statements of statistical power calculations, can help redirect resources and attention to the most promising interventions. Our review also made clear that the very definition of maltreatment itself presents a barrier for researchers. Many of the included studies define maltreatment in terms of a child 's involvement with CPS or substantiation of alleged abuse. Neither criterion should be considered equivalent to the broader population of maltreated children because child welfare determinations are affected by community and state -level differences in how maltreatment is defined and reported. Additionally, differences in child welfare scrutiny for impoverished and minority families are well documented . The alternative of clinical assessment commonly seen in the literature often is vague in terms of how maltreatment is specifically operationalized and assessed, whether b y informal clinical interview or standardized measures. Studies were also often vague about their own inclusion cr iteria, which influenced our decision to restrict the review to children who had a reasonably clear history of maltreatment, rather than incl ude at -risk or mixed samples that posed further definitional challenges. We did not encounter any study that stratified findings by children at risk or with known exposure . Many studies did not provide specific information about the type and number of even ts, timing, chronicity , context of children' s maltreatment, or any co -occurrence of other potentially traumatic events . Although common problems in the research literature, we recognize that the effort to improve clarity about aspects of maltreatment is fr aught with difficulty. CPS records and clinical assessment protocols both are subject to inaccuracy, misidentification, and omission errors; both are only as accurate as the information that has observed, reported, or inferred. Theoretical orientation proved a daunting area to examine in this review. Even when a treatment ascribed to a primary theory of change, rarely did an intervention adhere exclusively to that theory or related intervention strategies . Some \"borrow ed\" facets of various orientations; others balanced one or more perspectives . For example, PCIT emphasizes the behavioral aspects of its approach yet also includes an explicitly relational phase based in attachment theory that precedes the focus on effective behavioral management. Additionally , many studies did not fully describe the key components of their interventions, maki ng it difficult to know what actually occurred within treatment sessions and whether the therapist 's actions corresponded to the purported theory. 143 Study Measurement and Analysis Many studies were reviewed but subsequently excluded because they did not employ well - established , reliable, and valid assessment measures. We required that outcome measures offer more than face validity; we looked for some evidence of construct or predictive validity. When such evidence was clearly lacking in the extant literature , we excluded the studies or the specific outcomes within a study. As a result, our review does not include all data from included studies. Identification of child sympto matology was inconsistent across studies, for both younger and older children. Typically, intervention was based on an event, maltreatment or involvement with CPS, rather than symptomatic or functional impairment. This reflects a general tendency for syste ms to refer for mental health care based on events of concern, whereas families describe symptoms and functional problems as reasons for treatment. A further complication was that the approaches used to assess symptomatology and impairment varied and did not always involve commonly used, well -validated measures . Many, far from all, studies compared baseline characteristics, usually demographics, between treatment and control groups. Ideally analyses should account for other potentially important differences at baseline (e.g., exposure to trauma, symptom patterns and levels, severity of maltreatment, family characteristics) . Moreover, the majority of studies we reviewed failed to provide sufficient attention to differences in children' s cognitive, social -emotional, and language development. As a result, there was limited evidence to assess treatment effectiveness or issues that affected treatment response by age group. The lack of developmental differentiation is consistent with other limitations that are, at least in part, sequelae of small samples that preclude subgroup analyses and examination of moderating and mediating effects. A large number of studies exceeded our criteria for risk of attrition bias : total study attrition above 30 percent or differentia l attrition between the active treatment and control groups greater than 15 percent . 200 We excluded several trials that admirably followed participants over a longer period (e.g., greater than 1 year) because too many of the participants were missing from the analysis of follow -up data.201-206 Future Research Needs The predominance of low SOE and inconsistent or no difference findings in the studies we reviewed calls for further research to resolve incongruous findings and improve our confidence that the evidence is free of error, accurate, and as representative as possible . A number of specific areas should be addressed in future research. Head -to-Head Trials The evidence base for effective interventions for maltreated children is composed primarily of single trials with relatively short -term results absent head -to-head studies comparing interventions of interest. At this juncture, additional comparative efficacy and effectiveness trials are needed to build the evidence for interventions with low SOE. When studies include multiple conditions, reporting of one -to-one ( pairwise ) comparisons is critical. 110,207 Compa risons of bona fide interventions that are fully representative of alternative treatment options is another substantive gap to address. 144 Intervention Considerations A gap in the current literature is comparative research with existing interventions that hav e an established evidence base of efficacy or effectiveness with other populations and rigorous testing of adaptations. Adaptations may exclude or substantially modify components of an original version, resulting in fundamental change s relative to the orig inal intervention. Thus, research on adaptations demands particularly close attention on the part of the researcher to therapist - and participant -level characteristics and other factors (e.g., setting, timing). The paucity of relevant contrasts for KQ 3 suggest s a need for a qualitative analysis of the literature to identify treatment characteristics that are relevant to and useful for the field. We noted the distinction between and unequal attention paid to specific techniques (e.g., intervention- specific strategies and content) in relation to factors that may be common across interventions at the level of client -therapist interactions (e.g., therapeutic relationship, personal characteristics of therapist and patient , engagement ). The latter may be essential to understanding treatment efficacy or effectiveness and merits further attention. 183-185 Assessment of Clinical Need The use of common and validated measures for identifying symptomatology is a major omission undermining the strength of the evidence base. Greater coalescence around such measures will help future reviews generalize findin gs across studies and settings and create greater consensus in the field around effective and ineffective interventions by intr oducing common metrics. Additional research is particularly needed to determine the relative benefits of various interventions across age subgroups . Outcomes The use of well -established, reliable, and valid assessment measurement and more consistent use of measures is imperative for interpreting the precision and directness of outcomes. Future research is also needed in the area of longer -term outcomes , including duration of symptom remission or functional improvement, generalization of outcomes from one se tting to another, outcome variability according to clinically heterogeneous subgroups, and subsequent retraumatization . An outcome that is particularly deserving of deeper assessment is the extent to which children involved in the child protective syste m achieve a meaningfully positive placement . Currently, p ermanency outcomes generally reflect study constraints rather than the desired outcome of a constant, stable relationship with a parent or caregiver who comes to love and accept responsibility for a mal treated child . Research on Engagement /Retention Another future research need is intensified attention to strategies that foster treatment and study retention. We were able to find only one comparative study for inclusion in this review relevant to the iss ue of engagement and retention. T his is an area that has remained elusive for decades because of numerous barriers experienced by vulnerable families . Commitment of time and effort is not limited to participation in treatment sessions. It often includes time, effort, and cost for transportation; conflicting work schedules; child care for other siblings; and early established impressions about the responsiveness of the therapist and the potential benefit of treatment. Families where maltreatment has occurred or who are providing out -of-home care contend with a host of other challenges (e.g., poverty, familial conflict, requirements of child 145 welfare and other service systems) that can preclude their participating in interventions or research. These many issues similarly affect sustained participation in study assessments. One immediate next step in this area is building further research on motivational cointerventions, given the promising findings regarding PCIT combined with a motivational orientation.95-97 Future research could compare interventions in terms of retention or examine features of interventions associated with engagement and retention. Study Design and Reporting Researchers should review and u se the CONSO RT statement to ensure the greatest clarity in reporting of trials.208 Future studies need to be adequately powered and statistical power calculations presented. Trials in this field do not typically blind participants or providers, but future studies should make every effort to blind outcome assessors to redu ce the risk of detection bias. Statistical Considerations Even with concerns about limited sample sizes and attrition, few studies in the literature we reviewed included an intention to treat (ITT) analysis. ITT analysis may not be useful when there is differential attrition across study conditions, as was often the case for the maltreatment studies we reviewed. Howeve r, in cases where there is not high differential attrition, ITT analysis helps avoid the error of incorrectly attributing effectiveness to an intervention that actually may result from underlying differ ences in the final study groups . More consistent use a nd clear reporting of ITT analysis would enhance the interpretability and generalizability of study findings. Other concerns related to statistical analysis and inferences pertain t o the need to control for multiple comparisons and limit post -hoc analyses. Future studies should account for multiple comparisons and clearly state planned statistical analyses. In complex multifactorial interventions, planned statistical analyses should include the assessment of mediators and moderators. Beyond these more comm on statistical issues, a more fundamental question that merits increased attention in future research is how scientists should approach probabilistic estimates of effects and how to express confidence in their findings. Across the scientific literature we reviewed, researchers used only a classical/frequentist approach to hypothesis testing that views probability as the likelihood of a given result being true or false with a null hypothesis rejected or accepted with a certain probability of an accurate conclusion or \"true effect. \" Relying on p- values to assess whether a research finding is true may be subject to inherent error associated with small sample sizes and extensive heterogeneity of design, definitions, and outcomes, among other considerations. 209 Hence, the use of alternative statistical analyses, namely Bayesian methods, may be warranted in future research because of the complexity of the population and heterogeneity of clinical need. Implementation and Sustainability Research Finally, a major gap in the current evidence base is rigorous study of implementation and/or issues related to maintenance of an intervention . Fidelity to the intervention model was infrequently reported a nd sparse in detail. To address the twin challenges of a stressed population and tight reimbursement guidelines, successful interventions must be effective and feasible to implement and maintain . Issues that will inform transportability to general communit y settings, accessibility and utilization by maltreating families, or their effective use by implementing 146 clinicians should be more explicitly considered in future research. For example, future efficacy studies are needed on lower intensity interventions a nd factors that affect accessibility for this highly vulnerable population. Relatedly, there is a notable gap in attention to \" dose\" or how much of an intervention is needed to e ffect change that should be addressed in future research. Another practical co nsideration for the development and testing of real -world interventions relates to the costs of service delivery (e.g., provider training, clinical effort, and practice infrastructure), service receipt (e.g., family transportation, child care, health care deductibles and coinsurance), and potential revenue (e.g., Medicaid, private insurance, public and private funders). With most mental health care based on service reimbursement, future research is clearly needed on the interplay of treatment model and structure, service definitions, utilization management, treatment authorization, and claims submission and authorization. Implications for Research The myriad methodological, conceptual, and operational challenges to clinical research with maltreated children and maltreating families, which led to the methodological and substantive gaps in the evidence base described above, cannot be overcome by individual, site -specific, time - limited studies largely conducted by the developers of interventions or single resear ch teams. To move the science forward, there clearly is a need for exten sive multisite collaboration. A research network, for example, would provide the platform for efficient and methodologically rigorous collaborative clinical trials . It would allow for large enough samples to examine moderators of treatment response and investigate subgroups for whom treatments are less, or more, effective. 210,211 A clinical research network could be an extension of an existing s tructure or structures, such as the National Child Traumatic Stress Network. A central and ongoing barrier to c onduct ing rigorous research in this area is employ ing randomization or quasi -random ization procedures, because these designs raise thorny issues for clinicians and other stakeholders serving maltreated children and their families. Although the concerns are not unique to maltreatment research, community -based professionals may be, for example, reluctant to see their clientele randomized to a no int ervention or usual care group that they perceive as less effective than the intervention under investigation. This dynamic plays out across clinical trials where community providers and clients may feel that a valuable treatment option, even if it is exper imental, has been denied to them. This subsequently may foster differential study engagement and attrition. Again, a multisite collaborative could provide a powerful nexus for shared strategies and best practices that result in successful implementation of controlled research studies in this challenging field. Implications for Clinical Practice For clinicians, the stringent criteria of this CER may raise questions about its applicability for typical practice settings such as community mental health agencie s, health centers, schools, and private practices. Faced with relatively few interventions meeting the criteria for greater SOE, there is a potential to conclude that this report has little relevance to a community provider. Clinicians are well aware of th e complexity of direct service for maltreated children and for many other vulnerable populations who present with multiple comorbid diagnos es and where individual, family, and community risk factors , experiences of trauma and adversity , and barriers to treatment participation exist. Although there has been a groundswell of support for using evidence -based treatments, they are relatively new models that often are unfamiliar to a community practitioner. Additionally, c ommunity therapists do not have the luxur y of treating 147 only clientele whose presentation accords to an evidence- based treatment. Nor can they await the fulfillment of calls for better research, for example, in the form of head -to-head comparisons of active treatments or designs that allow larger samples to address varied populations subgroups. Instead, and in this report, they are challenged to consider the relative evidence of one or another approach in a given clinical context. Further, this report offers clinicians a synthesis of research limitations associated with widely used practices and point to factors clinicians might consider in their own formulations and treatment decisions. For example, the interventions highlighted as benefiting mental and behavioral health, caregiver -child relationsh ips, child development, and child welfare status represent treatment selection priorities. Studies that were included yet found to have lesser scientific support may be second- line options or represent best available options for given predisposing maltreat ment events or certain clinical presentations. Of course, selection from among the interventions in this review must be considered in light of clinical context (e.g., comorbidities, motivation for treatment, primary symptoms). Finally, providers will, no d oubt, turn to other interventions. The selection criteria in this review may still guide that process. Clinicians may consider the extent to which their clientele are reflected in studies of a particular intervention (i.e., sample representativeness), the relevance of study outcomes (i.e., applicability), and the extent to which they are able to adopt a practice with strong attention to fidelity. Outcome findings in this review may assist clinicians to fine -tune outcomes to be expected from a particular app roach, modality, or level of care. Based on this refined knowledge, expectations may be communicated to clients to facilitate engagement and positive, realistic expectations for change. These suggestions are but an early step toward improving the relevance of research to therapists and other providers, which is critical if standards of care are to improve rather than remain static. A primary motive for clinicians involves their desire for effective work that benefits their clients and engenders a sense of competence, mastery, and satisfaction. Thus, in the face of such a limited base of evidence for interventions with maltreated children, this review may heighten clinicians ' awareness and investment in sound implementation practices. These include attention , at both the provider and supervisor levels, to systematic treatment fidelity, barriers to implementation, and obstacles to sustainable practice. 212 Attention to adoption and effective implementation of a new practice is crucial and depends on clinical training that is supported by adherence to a clear treatment manual, ongoing consultation in model application to clinical practice, and practice that is guided by an expert provider and trainer. Implications for Policy This report presents highly specific research that may not correspond readily to practices in real-world community settings. The two approaches for which there was strongest evidence based on effectiveness studies91,92,100 were each tested in only one trial, and the SOE for most interventions included in this review was low. Given the early stage of research in the field, we caution that this report should not be taken as a guide to the selection of s pecific approaches for wider dissemination. Rather, the central finding of this review for policymakers and payers is the relative scarcity o f evidence to guide the field in meeting the needs of this vulnerable population of children. Two implications for policymakers are immediately evident. First, there is an urgent need for collaborative clinical trials to move the field of child maltreatment intervention forward. A multisite research network is a powerful platform that could efficiently furnish collabo rative 148 studies of sufficient quality and size to build a stronger evidence base for effective practice. The National Child Traumatic Stress Network offers an existing infrastructure that could be expanded to support and provide scientific leadership for collaborative multisite trials. Alternatively, or in addition, an existing clinical research network could be expanded or a new network formed to focus on child maltreatment intervention. Such initiatives will, in many respects, require a paradigm shift in f unding to prioritize and adequately support complex research endeavors over single -site, small studies conducted by treatment developers or single research groups. It also will also require a recalibration of time frame expectations for study implementatio n with vulnerable populations and the creation of flexible funding mechanisms that seamlessly support the trajectory from efficacy to translation for rigorously examined interventions that show consistent, robust effects. A second area where policymakers can have a major positive impact is in incentivizing higher quality program and administrative data that will both serve research needs and drive data- informed decision- making at the program and clinical levels. Program -record databases typically collect the minimal information pertinent to billing or other administrative needs and not necessarily case- outcome data. Field agencies that must compete for limited do llars to support their programs are rarely able to focus on systematic data or participate readi ly in rigorous research activities. The collection of implementation and outcome data is rarely incentivized within an agency or practice or in the form of enhanced payment rates from insurers. The end result, in a context of dwindling resources to support the cost of providing quality care, is disincentive for programs to engage in activity beyond what is specifically reimbursed. Conclusions Maltreatment intervention research , particularly comparative research, remains a relatively nascent field. Much of the research relies on small samples and has limited statistical power, so data cannot be stratified based on subgroups or considered in terms of potential mediators and moderators of effect (e.g., age, type and chronicity of maltreatment). It is critical to note that low or insufficient SOE is not equivalent to a judgment of an intervention as ineffective. Rather it reflects the justifiable state of affairs where many promising or widely used approaches have not been the subjects of empirical study. This review draws attention to the herculean efforts involved in conducting high- quality trials of mental health and psychosocial interventions, a challenge that is potentiated with the vulnerable, maltreated population that is the focus of this review. Althoug h several interventions emerged with evidence to support their efficacy or effectiveness, the strength of the evidence was low for the vast majority of outcomes. Consequently, our main finding was that the literature in this field is strikingly limited due to numerous substantive and methodological gaps. These limitations include (a) the predominance of single trials conducted by the treatment developers testing unique interventions that often employ strategies very similar to those of other approaches, (b) usual care or wait -list controls rather than head -to-head comparisons, (c) short -term outcomes, (d) inadequate reporting of attrition, and (e) wide heterogeneity in type and psychometric soundness of outcome measurement across studies. Thus, this review serves as an urgent call for improving and building the evidence base for interventions to promote the well -being of maltreated children. A multisite research network is a powerful platform t hat could facilitate the conduct of large, methodologically rigor ous 149 comparative efficacy and effectiveness trials that are needed to move the field forward. More broadly, a paradigm shift is required on the part of researchers and funders alike to galvanize the commitment and resources necessary for conducting collabor ative clinical trials with these particularly vulnerable children and families. 150 References 1.
