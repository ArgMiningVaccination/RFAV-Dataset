C. How Made: Poloxalene is considered a co-polym er of propylene oxide (PO) and ethy lene oxide (EO). Propylene oxide, polypropylene oxide, and its copolymer s with ethylene oxide have the la rgest volume and importance in the polyurethane and surfactant in dustry (Kirk-Othmer 1996b). The annual prod uction of PO in the US was close to 2 billion kg as of 1996. There are two princi pal processes used: the trad itional chlorohydrin proces s and indirect the hydroperoxide process that uses a molybdenum cataly st. Both processes start with propylene (propene) derived from cracking of petroleum. The chlorhydri n process involves reac tion of propylene (CH 3CH=CH 2) and chlorine in the presence of water to produce two isom ers of propylene chlorhydrin. This is followed by dehydrochlorination using caustic soda or lime to produce propylene oxide and salt. The hydroperoxide proce ss involves oxidation of propylene to PO by an organic hydroperoxide, producing an alcohol as a co-product. One of the po ssible alcohols (tert-butanol, TBE) produced as a by-product from this process is used as feedstock for MTBE, a ga soline additive. (Kirk-Othmer 1996b) Ethylene oxide (epoxyethane) is formed by oxidation of ethyle ne (also derived from cracking of petroleum) with oxygen, using a silver catalyst at 250 de g. C. at 20 atm. The primary uses for ethyle ne oxide is in the manufacture of derivatives such as surfactants, ethanolamines, et hylene glycol and polyethylene glycols us ed in cosmetics, food additives, * This Technical Advisory Panel (TAP) review is based on the information available as of the date of this review. This review a ddresses the requirements of the Organic Foods Production Act to the best of the investigator 's ability, and has been reviewed by experts on the TAP. The su bstance is evaluated against the criteria found in section 2119(m) of th e OFPA (7 USC 6517(m)). The information and advice presented to the NOSB is based on the technical evaluation against that criteria, and is not intended to incorp orate commercial availability, so cio-economic impact or any othe r factor that the NOSB and the USDA may want to consider in making their decisions. NOSB TAP Review Compiled by OMRI Poloxalene Livestock pharmaceuticals, ointments, textile pro cessing, and as water solubl e lubricants, among many other uses (Kirk-Othmer 1996a, Clugston 1998). PO and EO are highly reactive and both are considered haza rdous. Ethylene oxide is used as a fumigant and sterilizing agent, as an anti -microbial pesticide to fumigate spices, and has been studied as rocket fuel and component of munitions (Kirk-Othmer 1996a). However, the EOPO copolymers ar e considered low hazard, low vapor pressure liquids. Contact with skin, eyes , or inhalation causes irri tation. There are no known acute or chronic affects associated with polyols (Kirk-Othmer 96b). The stability of some resulting pol yalkene polymers (such as polypropylene) is of concern in the case of indiscriminate use due to the unreactivity and non-biodeg radability (Clugston, 98). Specific (alfalfa, clover) bloat (ruminal tympany) in cattle. It is also used as a surfactant and dispersant in pesticide formulations (Baur, et al. 1997, Meister 2000). Poloxame r has listed as emulsifiers, surfactants, or stabilizers (USP 2000). Action: Bloat is caused the entrapment of fe mentation gases in the rumen. The bubbles mix with the ruminal fluids to form a stable foam. Poloxalene is a non-ionic surfactant that lowers the surface tension of the frothy mass so the bubble film is weakened and can no longer contain the gas. The foam collapses back to the li quid level, unblocking the esophagus so that the animal can orally expel gases. Combinations: Poloxalene may be administered as a drench (orally throug h a tube), preventively fed in a molasses block containing 6.6% poloxalene, and as a top dressing for feed using a 53% poloxalene top dressing on individual rations of ground feed (21CFR 520.1840). Status Historic Use Poloxalene is used by conventional prod ucers as an effective antidote and pr eventive measure for pasture bloat. OFPA, USDA Final Rule OFPA 6509(d) requires that pr oducers not use any subtherape utic doses of antibiotics, not use synthetic internal parasiticides on a routine basis, or ad minister medication, other than vaccinations, in the absence of illness. OFPA 6509(c)(3) requires that producers shall not use growth promoters and hormones, including antibiotics and synthetic trace elements used to stimulate growth or production. OFPA 6517 (c)(1)(B)(I) pr ovides that a synthetic substance can be added to the National List in the categories th at include livestock parasiticides and medicines. Poloxamer is listed by the US Pharmocope ia as a pharmaceutic aid, including surf actant, ointment base, tablet binder and emulifying agent. Poloxalene is listed as a surf actant (USP 2000). The NOP final rules at 7 CFR 205.238(b) allows the use of sy nthetic medication in the case of illness, provided the medication is listed in 205.603. Regulatory Regulated by FDA as a New Animal drug, 21CFR 520.1840 and as a New Anim al Drug for use in Feeds at 21 CFR558.464. EPA/NIEHS/Other Appropriate Sources EPA - Polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymer is on EPA List 4B, \"inert ingr edients for which EPA has sufficient information to conclude that th eir current use patterns in pesticide products will not adversely affect public health and the environment\" (EPA, 97). NIEHS - no listing in the Nati onal Toxicology Database. Status Among U.S. Certifiers An informal survey of 30 US agencies resulted in twelve re sponses from certifiers. Nine re ported no experien ce with this material. Two agencies specifically prohibit its use, and one repor ted they considered natural alternatives to be adequate. International February 16, 2001 Page 2 of 10 NOSB TAP Review Compiled by OMRI Poloxalene Livestock CODEX- Livestock standards at Step 8 (final adoption scheduled fo r July 2001) allows chemical allopathic veterinary drugs or antibiotics, when acceptable al ternative preventive methods do not exis t, provided that they are used under veterinarian's care with a minimum withholding of 48 hours or double the withdrawal time. EU 2092/91 - Similar to Codex, with an additional proviso that an imals treated more than 2 time s or maximum of 3 times per year with chemical veterinary drugs can no longer be marketed as organic (Annex I, Section B 4). IFOAM - similar to Codex and EU, natural products and preven tive methods preferred, but use of veterinary medicines is permitted under control of certification agency. Canada - Similar to CODEX with the withdrawal period \"a t least double the permitted federal withdrawal period allowed for veterinary drugs\" (CGSB, 1999). Section 2119 OFPA 7 U.S.C. 6518(m)(1-7) Criteria 1. The potential of the substance for detrimen tal chemical interactions with other materi als used in organic farming systems. When used as a drench at the labeled rate of 1 fluid ounc e for animals up to 500 lbs., and 2 fluid ounces at over 500 lbs., this material is unlikely to have a ne gative impact on orga nic farming system. 2. The toxicity and mode of action of the subs tance and of its breakdown products or an y contaminants, and their persistence and a reas of concentration in the environment. FDA does not list any withdrawal times or residue tolerances for poloxalene. (21CFR) 3. The probability of environmental contamination during ma nufacture, use, misuse, or disposal of the substance. The production of organic polymers from petroleum sources is a large volume chemical manufacturing process that has significant environmental impact. 4. The effects of the substance on human health. Poloxalene is listed by USP for use as pharmeuceutic aid. It is reported to have no known toxicity (Winters, 99) and is not listed in the National Toxicology Program Database. 5. The effects of the substance on biological and chemical interactions in the agroecosystem, includin g the physiological effects of the substance on soil organisms (including the salt index and solubility of th e soil), crops and livestock. Not known, but probably of minor impact. 6. The alternatives to using the substance in terms of practices or other available materials. Description of the disorder: Bloat (ruminal tympany) is considered a feeding problem, and occurs in both beef and dairy cattle when the normal process of eructation or belching is interrupted and th e gases produced in the rume n by fermentation cannot be expelled. Sheep can also be affected, though are much le ss susceptible than cattle. The rumen rapidly swells, the cow experiences severe pain and may, in extreme cases, die within a few minutes of showing clinical signs. The causal factor of pastur e bloat is a foaming or frothiness of the ruminal contents into a stable persistent foam. It usually occurs when animals are pastured on lush legume pastures, and also may occur on wheat pasture (Ensminger 91, Webster 93). Anot her type of bloat is called fe edlot or grain bloat, thought to be associated with the feeding of finely ground grai n, or when high concentrate low roughage ra tions have been fed for 60 days or longer (Radostitis 94, Ensminger 91). Pasture bloat has a seasona l occurrence when the pasture is lushest. Spring and autumn are the most dangerous seas ons when the plants contain a hi gh content of soluble proteins. The extent of incidence is not reliably known (Radostitis, 91). A survey of 3 12 farms in New Zealand over a period of 2 months revealed that 87% of all farms experience d bloat ranging from mild to severe (Radostitis, 94). Enmsminger contends that bloa t is widespread, more severe in some areas than others, and causes average annual losses in beef and dairy cattle of more than $100 milli on (Ensminger 91). Grazing syst ems that rely on rotational grazing may be prone to bloat in the sp ringtime, if the cows are moved frequent ly to gain access to large quantities of fresh herbage. A New Zealand reference suggests cows that are given their daily pasture allowance in one break should be drenched for bloat control onc e per 24 hours before they move onto their fresh break each day, or that paddocks be opened up to a larger pasture so cows are not rotated as much in the spring (Holmes, 87). Prevention of pasture bloat: 1) Avoid straight legume pastures and immature legumes. 2) Feed a coarse grass hay prior to turning onto lush pasture. February 16, 2001 Page 3 of 10 NOSB TAP Review Compiled by OMRI Poloxalene Livestock 3) feed dry forage al ong with pasture 4) Avoid a rapid full from an empty start. 5) Keep animals continuously on pasture after they are once turned out. 6) Keep salt and water conveniently accessible at all time s and wait until dew is o ff alfalfa before grazing. 7) Plant bloat resistant cultivars the pasture (Ensminger 91, Majak 95). 8) Some animals have a genetic disposition for bloat, and this trait can be evaluated in a breeding program (Majak 1990, Radostitis 94). Treatment: Animals should be immediately moved off the bloating past ure. Mild cases may be treated by keeping the animal on its feed and moving, drenching either with 1 pint of corn oil or soybean oil or 1-2 oz. poloxalene. Severe cases should be treated by a veterinarian or owners when no time is available. In severe cases, when there is gross distension, mouth breathing wi th protrusion of the tongue and staggering a rumenotony (puncturing of the rumen with a trocar) may be ne cessary to save the animal. Once the animal falls down it will die in a few minutes. Irrigation and cleansing of the wound usually results in uneventful recove ry (Radostitis, 1994). Alternative drenches include sodium bicarbonate and non-toxic oils, includin g mineral oil and vegetable oils. Continued administration of mineral o il causes restriction of carotene absorption and rescues the carotene and tocopherol content of the butter produced. Linseed oil, soy oil, and whale oil have undesirable effect on the quality and flavor of the milk. Peanut oil and tallow are the most satisfactory. New Zealand sy stems have had success with administering anti-foaming agent or oils in drinking water with an automati c dose syringe in the milking parlor (Radostitis, 1994). Oils are sometimes sprayed on pastures as preventive agents, and then the pastures are strip grazed. In addition to poloxalene, other synthe tic treatments include alcohol ethoxyla te detergents (not approved on the National List), and controlle d release antibiotics (prohi bited by the Final Rule). Both poloxalene and alcohol ethoxylate detergents are faster acting than the oils, whic h are more suited for prevention than treatment (Radostitis, 94). Poloxalene is also available in mola sses blocks, or as a feed topdressing, but there is sometimes a question of effectiveness if the animal does not voluntarily ingest it. 7. Its compatibility with a system of sustainable agriculture. Clearly, there are many preventive measures that can be taken to avoid pasture bloat. Organic farmers seeking to establish a pasture based syst em for ruminants may occasionally experien ce unforeseen incidence of pasture bloat that requires an emergency remedy. Use of this synthetic ma terial could be justified to alleviate animal suffering on a very occasional basis. February 16, 2001 Page 4 of 10 NOSB TAP Review Compiled by OMRI Poloxalene Livestock TAP Reviewer Discussion * Reviewer 1 [Veterinarian with ovine (sheep) experience] Poloxalene is a synthetic product and is used in the treatm ent of acute bloat in ruminant s, which is a life-threatening condition. I think the product fares well under the 7 OFPA criteria with the exception of the possible environmental impacts. As it is a derivative of petroleum, of course it would be nice to not have to use it. However, I think its use in organic agriculture should be limited enough that the environmental issue alone is not justificati on for disallowing its use. While I have used sodium bicarbonate an d non-toxic oils, and have had farmers us e them, they are best used in mild cases of bloat as they take longer to have an effect. The use of polaxalene is extremely effective in severe cases of bloat and could fall under the category of good animal welfare. Bloat can be controlled largely by using the management strategies outlined in the OFPA criteria [see number 6 alternatives]. It is critical that all organic livestock producers use these preventative measures. Many farmers can go for years and never have a case of bloa t and then have two or three cases in a row. Weather is a factor, as is the animal's intake preference at the time wh en the legumes may cause the highest incidence of bloat. In other words, there are some things that can't be controlled and those times are when farmers need to have a medication such as poloxalene at their di sposal. I particularly liked the proviso in th e EU 2092/91 stating that besides a doubling of the withdrawal time, any animal treated a maximum of three times a year be withdrawn from the organic herd. In this case, as there is no withdrawal time, a minimum of 48 hours could be used for a withdrawal period. Advised Recommendation I agree with the recommendation that polox alene, only in the drench form, be allowed for use as a medical treatment for emergency use only in the case of severe acute bloat. For m ilder cases of bloat, the alternative drenches of oils and sodium bicarb should be sufficient. The prophylactic use of po loxalene in molasses blocks or as a top drench should be prohibited. Reviewer 2 [Doctor of Veterinary Medicine wi th a degree in public health, former state health department official, a researcher in pharmac euticals and biological products, with experi ence in organic certification ] The file was fairly complete on this substance with all sour ces in agreement (including ad ditional references assimilated by this reviewer) that poloxalene is a sy nthetic material. I will restrict my revi ew to a brief comment on the first six OFPA criteria with reference to poloxalene and a somewhat lengthier discussion regarding the seventh criteria. My review also assumes that the use being considered is only as a drench for emergency use in cases of pasture bloat in cattle. Bloat occurs in sheep but seems to be predominantl y a concern for bovine health (Merck Veterinary Manual, 1998), and poloxalene is considered less effective in sheep in any case (Radostits, 1994). Poloxalene also does not seem to be considered a treatment of choice for feedlot bloat in cattle nor for grain bloat in dairy (Merck Veterinary Manual, 1998). Compatibility with OFPA Criteria 1) The potential of the substance for detr imental chemical interaction with other mate rials used in organic farming systems. I agree with the OMRI review that when used as a drench , the negative impact on other materials used in organic farming systems is likely to be minimal. Poloxalkols have been known to increase the absorption of fat-soluble substances in humans (Blacow, 1975) If emergency overdosing or prophylactic overuse occurs in cattle, given the lengthy duration of effect by poloxalene, disruption of feed ration ba lancing may theoretically be a concern. * OMRI's information is enclosed in square brackets in Italics.

February 16, 2001 Page 5 of 10 NOSB TAP Review Compiled by OMRI Poloxalene Livestock 2) The toxicity and mode of action of the substance and its brea kdown products or any contaminan ts, and their persistence and a reas of concentration in the environment. Again when used as a drench, there appears to be littl e concern for the environment due to the small amounts employed and the paucity of data indica ting that poloxalene itself is a signif icant environmental contaminant. As far as toxicity to the animal is concerned, a review of the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) website for reports of animal poisonings from veterinary use products coveri ng the period 1987-1998 indicated that there were only 3 incidents with poloxalene with 60 animals exposed and only 3 deaths. Its use as an ingredient of medicated free-choice supplemental feed would bring it under the general warning of the Center for Veterinary Medicine agains t free-choice systems as representing a great potential for drug overdosing resulting in animal safety hazards or human food safety residue concerns. ( Benz 1998 ) 3) The probability of environmental co ntamination during manufacture, use, mi suse, or disposal of the substance. While the use of poloxalene itself as pr oposed here may not pose a significant ri sk to the environment, it is derived from polypropylene oxide and ethylene oxide. These chemic als have significant and deleterious impacts and belong to the family of synthetic polymers produced from petrol eum sources that basically comprise a field of study in environmental and human toxicology unto themselves. 4) The effects of the substance on human health. No reports of human poisonings from the veterinary use of poloxalene we re present in the CVM database nor much mention of human toxicity at all (except as noted above for increasing absorpti on of fat-soluble substances) in any of the sources that I reviewed. 5) The effects of the substance on biological and chemical intera ctions in the agroecosystem, in cluding the physiological effec ts of the substance on soil organisms (including the salt index and so lubility of the soil), crops and livestock. I have nothing to add to the [presented] findings on this, except to agree that there is probably minor impact. 6) The alternatives to using the substance in te rms of practices or othe r available materials. Bloat is a serious problem and the annual mortality of dair y cattle grazing on pasture may be as high as 1%. Bloat may occur on the first day after being tu rned out but is more likely on the sec ond or third day. Death may occur as soon as 1 hour after grazing begins, but more commonly does not result until 3-4 hours after symptoms begin. (Merck Veterinary Manual, 1998) The alternatives to poloxalene are to us e other anti-foaming agents such as ve getable oils (e.g., peanut, corn, and soybean oil), or mineral oils (paraffins), sodium bicarbonate, diocytl sodium sulfosucci nate, household detergent, ethoxylate detergents, and ionophores (Merck Veterinary Manual, 1998). The ve getable oils would appear to pass muster under OFPA criteria, as perhaps would mineral oil and sodium bica rbonate for regulated use. Tying a 1-inch diameter stick or piece of wood in the affected animal's mouth like a bit on a horse brid le to increase salivation, walking the animal around, passing a stom ach tube, trocarization (via a small sk in incision) and placement of a large- bore cannula (1 in. in diameter) into the rumen, rumenotom y (via a 4-8 in. incision into the rumen itself) are other approaches to treatment. They are of ten employed in combination with ad ministration of anti-foaming agents. Pasture management and culling chronic bloaters are method s of prevention. All the sources I reviewed indicated that vegetable oils an d mineral oil are effective treatments. In fact the Merck Manual discusses poloxalene only in the control and preven tion section not under treatmen t. However, Radostits et al. state that surfactants are preferred to oils because they are faster, require smaller doses, and have a longer period of effectiveness. February 16, 2001 Page 6 of 10 NOSB TAP Review Compiled by OMRI Poloxalene Livestock 7) Its compatibility with a system of sustainable agriculture. This material is not compatible with a system of organic, sustainable agricultur e. It is synthetic and is derived from chemicals that are significant environm ental contaminants, and thus the use of poloxalene in organic farming would be contributing (in principle, if not in quantity) to their continued manu facture and dispersal in the environment. There are acceptable methods for the prevention of this di sorder and while allowing the emergency use of this chemical for unforeseen incidence of pasture bloat may se em reasonable, it is \"enab ling\" lax pasture management and animal husbandry practices cont rary to the principles of organic, sustainable agriculture. Moreover, other antifoaming agents do exist, which are compatible with orga nic criteria. While poloxalene may be the most convenient and perhaps the most effective, the other antifoaming agents discussed are also effective. Poloxalene is not indispensable to the treatment or management of bloat. In fact, there is a narrow window of time, place, and patient when it is the treatment of choice. It is not considered as effective a treatment for pasture bloat in sheep as in cattle, nor in cattle is it considered effective for feedlot bloat or grain bloat in dairy herds. Its utility, even in bovine pasture bloat, is limited to situations when symptoms are noted afte r it is too late to employ simpler corrective measures such as walking the animal around or fitting a bit into its mouth, but before the bloat has progressed to the point where a rumenot omy is required to save the life of the animal. As the petitioner for this product noted, they treated only 5 cows \"out of all our herds\" so far that year (apparently late in the year 2000). Because of this narrow range of situati ons when it would be the treatment of choice, I don't believe that its use can be justified to alleviate animal suffering . If the animal is visibly suffering, trocarization or rume notomy is called for and the resultant expulsion of gas would provide relief and permit appropriate follow-up treatment not requiring poloxalene. Advised Recommendation Given that the initial \"bright line\" for compatibility with orga nic principles is non-synthetic versus synthetic origin, this threshold should not be passed unless there are compelling reasons to do so. In the case of poloxalene, the fact that it may be used only on a very occasional basis and that it is more convenient than other approaches does not justify crossing that \"bright line.\" Reviewer 3 [Doctor of Veterinary Medicine with experience in animal nutrition, holistic animal health and organic agriculture] In the Summary of Advised Recommendations I think the wording should be changed from legume bloat to bloat or ruminal tympany. This wording should be used throughout any regulation. My reason for this is to keep an overly zealous inspector from disallowing its use for cases of bloat not related to legumes. [.....] I believe the above use would conform to the OFPA rule that allows the use of synthetic materials to treat acute disease conditions and to alleviate animal suffering on an occasional basis. In the past, I have used mineral oil as well as poloxalene to treat bloat. My experience was that the poloxalene gave the best results. Almost any oils given as a drench will wo rk some of the time but all have there own problems with organic use. Mineral oil is, I believe, a prohibited subs tance. With any of the natural oils there is now the possibility of GMO contamination. Given the need in emergency veterinary medicine, lack of toxicity, low usage rate and low dosage rate I would suggest approval of the use of poloxalene in an organic environment provided that it was only used to treat acute bloat. The Farm Management Plan should include measures to minimize the incidence of bloat and poloxalene should not be used as a \"crutch\" to cover up poor management. Compatibility with OFPA criteria 1. The potential of the substance for detrim ental chemical interactions with other ma terials used in organic farming systems. I agree with the [TAP statement that low rates used are unlikely to have a negative impact... ] 2. The toxicity and mode of action of the substance and of its breakdown products or an y contaminants, and their persistence and a reas of concentration in the environment. February 16, 2001 Page 7 of 10 NOSB TAP Review Compiled by OMRI Poloxalene Livestock \"FDA does not list any withdrawal times or residue tolerances for poloxalene. (21CFR)\" TAP Review also stated : \"EPA Polyoxyethylene-pol yoxypropylene copolymer is on EPA List 4B, \"inert ingredients for which EPA has sufficient information to c onclude that their current use patterns in pesticide products will not adversely af fect public health and the environment\" (EPA, 97).\" I agree with the above statement [s] and do not believe the emergency use of this product in ruminal tympany would result in any environment contamination. 3. The probability of environmental contamination during ma nufacture, use, misuse, or disposal of the substance. [cites TAP information...] It would seem that the miniscule amount of this total that is used on livestock would not contribute to any significant environmental impact. TAP Review also stated: \"The stabilit y of some resulting polyalkene polymers (such as polypropylene) is of concern in the case of indiscriminate use due to the unreacti vity and non-biodegradability (Clugston, 98).\" I do not believe the use of this substance in ruminal tympany constitutes 'indiscriminate use' . 4. The effects of the substance on human health. In light of the [information presented in the TAP review], I believe use of this product in cattle to treat acute ruminal tympany would have no effect on human health. 5. The effects of the substance on biological and chemical interactions in the agroecosys tem, including the physiological effects of the substance on soil organisms (including the salt index and solu bility of the soil), crops and livestock. I agree that any impact would be minor to almost non-ex istent. Also note ...FDA does not list any withdrawal times or residue tolerances for poloxalene. (21CFR) [Since EPA classes it as a list 4B inert ingred ient for pesticides I ...] do not believe the emergency use of this product in ruminal tympany would result in any environment contamination. 6. The alternatives to using the substance in term s of practices or other available materials. Of course there are many alternatives to almost anything . However, in my opinion, the mere presence of other oils etc should not preclude the use of another product that has been used safely by dairymen for decades. Also note from TAP Review that \"Both poloxal ene and alcohol ethoxylate detergents are faster acting than the oils, which are more suited for prevention than treatment (Radostitis, 94).\" When treating ruminal tympany response time to any treatment is of the utmost importance. I think this product should be allowed for em ergency use even though it is a synthetic. [.......] I believe this material should be used only as tr eatment for acute ruminal tymp any and should not be in feed or blocks. 7. Its compatibility with a system of sustainable agriculture. [....] I agree that poloxalene (even thought synthetic) should be allowed for emergency use to treat acute ruminal tympany and that such use is compatible with a system of sustainable agriculture Advised Recommendation: Even though Poloxalene is a synthetic, I believe the product should be allowed for occasional use ONLY to treat acute cases of ruminal tympany. I think a withholding period of 24 to 48 hours would be indicated. Conclusion Poloxalene is clearly synthetic and prohibited unless added to the National List for medical use. The TAP reviewers are divided and do not have a consensus r ecommendation. Two of the reviewers favo r its allowance for emergency use only based on a need to prevent suffering and promote animal welfare. The third reviewer finds the rare emergency use not to be a compelling reason for considering as a permitted synthetic and does not s ee it as indispensable given that other treatments are available for cases of mild bloat, and other emergency treatments are called for in life threatening circumstances. This is supported by the lack of historic a llowance, or demonstrated need by existing certification agencies. The two reviewers who favor limited allowance also suggested either an extended withdrawal time, or a limited allowance for a permitted numb er of emergency trea tments per year for organic animals. No data to support an February 16, 2001 Page 8 of 10 NOSB TAP Review Compiled by OMRI Poloxalene Livestock extended withdrawal time has been presented, but the NOSB may want to consider an overall policy for frequency of emergency treatment or develop criteria for emergency use medication in general.
