Make sure you lock windows and doors securely at night and when you are away. Common criminal strategies Be on alert for robbery ploys targeting visitors. Some criminals on highways target travellers leaving airports or other tourist destinations. They signal tourists to stop due to an issue with their vehicle. They then wait for the driver to pull over or exit the car before grabbing exposed valuables. Criminals may also throw items at the windshield, obscuring the view of the road and forcing the driver to pull over. If you're the victim of such a ploy: - avoid pulling over on the side of the road - put on your hazard lights and slowly drive to a gas station, police station or other safe and populated area Demonstrations Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. - Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place - Follow the instructions of local authorities - Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations [Mass gatherings (large-scale events)](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings) Fraud Credit card and ATM fraud occurs, including debit card cloning.

Country Entry Requirement* - Proof of vaccination is not required to enter this country. Recommendation - Vaccination is not recommended. * It is important to note that [country entry requirements](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/vaccination-requirements-and-recommendations-for-international-travellers-and-malaria-situation-per-country-2022-edition) may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination.

Measles [Measles](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/measles.html) is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air. Anyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles.

It is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally.

It is a viral disease spread to humans by mosquito bites. - Dengue can cause flu-like symptoms. In some cases, it can lead to severe dengue, which can be fatal. - The level of risk of dengue changes seasonally, and varies from year to year. The level of risk also varies between regions in a country and can depend on the elevation in the region. - Visit the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions webpage on [Dengue in the U.S. States and Territories](https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/areaswithrisk/in-the-us.html)for the most up-to-date information on dengue outbreaks in the United States - Visit the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions webpage on - Mosquitoes carrying dengue typically bite during the daytime, particularly around sunrise and sunset. [Protect yourself from mosquito bites](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/insect-bite-prevention.html). There is no vaccine or medication that protects against dengue fever. Animal precautions Some infections, such as [rabies](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/rabies) and influenza, can be shared between humans and animals. Certain types of activities may increase your chance of contact with animals, such as travelling in rural or forested areas, camping, hiking, and visiting wet markets (places where live animals are slaughtered and sold) or caves. Travellers are cautioned to avoid contact with animals, including dogs, livestock (pigs, cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats, and to avoid eating undercooked wild game. Closely supervise children, as they are more likely to come in contact with animals. Avian Influenza Human cases of avian influenza have been reported in this destination. [Avian influenza](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/avian-influenza) is a viral infection that can spread quickly and easily among birds and in rare cases it can infect mammals, including people. The risk is low for most travellers. Avoid contact with birds, including wild, farm, and backyard birds (alive or dead) and surfaces that may have bird droppings on them. Ensure all poultry dishes, including eggs and wild game, are properly cooked. Travellers with a higher risk of exposure include those: - visiting live bird/animal markets or poultry farms - working with poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, domestic ducks) - hunting, de-feathering, field dressing and butchering wild birds and wild mammals - working with wild birds for activities such as research, conservation, or rehabilitation - working with wild mammals, especially those that eat wild birds (e.g., foxes) All eligible people are encouraged to get the seasonal influenza shot, which will protect them against human influenza viruses.

Medical services and facilities Health care is excellent. Service is available throughout the country. However, treatment costs are expensive. All hospitals must accept and treat emergencies, regardless of the person's ability to pay. Clients will, however, be charged for all services rendered. Foreign visitors without travel health insurance will have to pay out of pocket for their medical treatment. Make sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays. Medication There are restrictions and prohibitions on the import of certain prescription drugs into the United States. Some medication that can be purchased over-the-counter in Canada is restricted to prescription-only status in the United States. - Bring sufficient quantities of your medication - Ensure to have a physician's note explaining your medical condition, if applicable Keep in Mind... The decision to travel is the sole responsibility of the traveller. The traveller is also responsible for his or her own personal safety. Be prepared. Do not expect medical services to be the same as in Canada. Pack a [travel health kit](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/kit), especially if you will be travelling away from major city centres. Laws and culture You must abide by local laws. Learn about what you should do and how we can help if you are [arrested or detained abroad](http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/arrest-detention). Laws vary greatly from state to state. Consult the website of the state you wish to visit prior to arrival. Penalties and transfer of offenders A serious violation of the law may lead to a jail sentence or, in some states, a death sentence. Canadian citizenship confers no immunity, special protection or rights to preferential treatment. If a jail sentence is imposed, it will be served in a U.S. prison, unless a request for a transfer to a Canadian prison is approved by the United States and Canada. Both countries have signed a treaty that permits a Canadian imprisoned in the United States to request a transfer to complete the sentence in a Canadian prison. Drugs Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences and heavy fines. Cannabis Although the possession of cannabis is legal in some U.S. states, it remains illegal under U.S. federal laws in any form and quantity, making it illegal to bring across the Canada-U.S. border. Don't attempt to cross the Canada-U.S. border with any amount of cannabis in any form, even if you are traveling to a U.S. state that has legalized possession of cannabis. If you do so, you can expect legal prosecution and fines, and possibly jail time.
