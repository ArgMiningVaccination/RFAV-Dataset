These volunteers brought their vast and varied knowledge, perspectives, and experiences, culminating in a rich contribution of ideas to guide our incredible city. After weeks of meetings, hundreds of hours of conversation, and bringing together nearly 400 people from across Chicago for a fast-paced series of in-depth discussions, we are excited to share this massive undertaking with all of you. On behalf of the staff at Chicago for the People, we are grateful for the effort, energy, and eagerness committee members have all shared, and know that a better Chicago is not possible without all of us. We are proud of the incredible show of commitment and dedication throughout this process. Developing this transition report was unique from previous administrations and was not without its learning moments. Mayor Johnson had the shortest transition period in Chicago history. As a true reflection of the mayor's principles, our process prioritized voices too often at the margins. We made every effort possible to maximize the number of people engaged in conversation. This was also the first mayoral transition in a post-COVID world, and we prioritized ensuring accessibility and inclusivity through in-person, hybrid, and virtual meetings. With hundreds of civic leaders, business leaders, movement organizers, and activists working together, there is incredible synergy and of course at times, points of contradiction. Real life holds space for contradiction and understanding that unity of values does not mean conformity of ideas. While the report attempts to summarize the conclusions and recommendations of the majority within each subcommittee, it should be noted that some individualized positions may not be reflected to the extent that they diverge from the majority view, and that accordingly the concurrence of each participant on each issue reflected here should not be assumed. The \"Bridges to Build\" section of each subcommittee reports honor the divergency of viewpoints. It aims to create opportunities to continue organizing for social change, deepen community engagement, and build bridges across diverse and sometimes oppositional perspectives. It was also important to maintain language used in its diverse expressions. While a glossary of terms is included in the appendix, readers may note mixed usage of terms like Latine, Latinx, Latino, or Hispanic, and the varied usage reflects how individuals within the subcommittees chose to identify. The community is not a monolith, and we not only acknowledge the differences, but embrace them. The subcommittee reports are submitted to uplift the unique conversations hosted within the group, so minimal edits were made to the content as the co-chairs submitted them. This report gives voice to a deep-seated belief in citizen expertise, collaborative design, and the value of those most impacted having a seat at the proverbial table for the purpose of co-governance. While subcommittee reports list proposed stakeholder groups to be engaged, these lists should be considered a starting point and are not exhaustive. Finally, the visual notes in this document reflect the multiple stages of each subcommittee's process. While some are notes from a single meeting and do not highlight the final report copy, others capture overall themes and highlights. THIS PROCESS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF A CONVERSATION WE HOPE CONTINUES THROUGHOUT MAYOR JOHNSON'S ADMINISTRATION. THIS IS BY NO MEANS ALL THE PEOPLE, OR ALL THE IDEAS, NEEDED TO MAKE CHICAGO A CITY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE. NONETHELESS, A SPECIFIC ROUND OF DEEP GRATITUDE IS EXTENDED TO THE STAFF OF CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE AND ALL THE CITY LEADERS WHO JOINED US ON THE JOURNEY . FORWARD TOGETHER, KATELYN JOHNSON & AMISHA PATEL \u2014 CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLECHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 5 Building Bridges and Growing the Soul of Chicago: A Blueprint for Creating a More Just & Vibrant City for AllCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 6 Executive Summary: Mayor Brandon Johnson's Transition Committee Report ACKNOWLEDGMENT We cannot build a more just future without acknowledging the injustices of the past. Therefore, we begin this report by recognizing and acknowledging that Chicago resides on the ancestral homelands of the Odawa, Ojibwe, Potawatomi, Miami, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Sac, and Fox tribes. We also acknowledge the significant contributions of marginalized groups whose exploited labor played a crucial role in shaping our vibrant city. OVERVIEW, PROCESS, AND PURPOSE A diverse group of nearly 400 Chicagoans was appointed by Mayor Brandon Johnson to work together on a document to uplift the values and vision that will define his administration over the next four years. The group was organized into eleven issue-focused subcommittees and an overarching executive committee of fourteen. Mayor Brandon Johnson insisted that the committee and subcommittees reflect the breadth and diversity of the city. And they do. They include diversity based on gender, generation, and neighborhood, and include representatives from business, civic, and community-based organizations. Individuals, including those working in academia, philanthropy, trade, unions, health, government, faith communities, and public services, as well as those from disabled and LGBTQ communities, have been a part of this process by design. Chicagoans from various racial, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds were also at the table. Over the past several weeks the committees came together for a series of short intensive discussions about an array of pressing problems and issues facing our city. There were debates and differences of opinion, to be sure, but we have emerged with overall consensus on a collective vision and path toward a safer, more equitable, inclusive and just city. This path is grounded in, and builds upon, Mayor Johnson's values and vision as articulated during his campaign for mayor. First and foremost, Chicago's people are its greatest asset, this administration has rightly and boldly made a commitment to prioritize policies and programs that invest in people. That will occur on many fronts. Chicago has 77 diverse and dynamic neighborhoods. They have existed in various states of disconnectedness, sometimes siloed, sometimes in tension, but always connected by the very land mass we call Chicago. The city is also a city of bridges, sturdy steel frames, strong cables, and even wooden planks carry us across the mighty Chicago River, connected waterways, lagoons, and ponds. A city forged in fire and surrounded by a fierce and mighty body of water, bridges are a part of our architecture and our identity. Bridge-building was an important goal of this process, and an important metaphor for our work. But in order for the bridges to be sturdy, we must engage in hard conversations, truth-telling and repair. Chicago is indeed a great global city, but any great global city must take care of the neighborhoods that contribute to that greatness. In each of the eleven subcommittee categories there are the recurring themes that reflect the complex and layered issues that confront our city. The themes represent both positives and negatives, both challenges and opportunities. They include issues JULY 2023CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 7 of community abandonment that co-exist with inspiring narratives of community resilience; the need for greater transparency and accountability in government, and the unequal access to power and decision making across race, class, age, and zip code co-exists with a new commitment to inclusive co-governance. Race and economic disparity are two behemoth issues that transcend our city limits, but live here as well. The history of racism has a long and sordid past in Chicago and is still very real and present. It is important to note that it shows up differently and impacts communities differently and unevenly. Anti-Black racism has undergirded the neglect of neighborhoods and schools, the gentrification of Black neighborhoods and forced exodus of tens of thousands of Black people from the city over the past 20 years, and higher levels of violence, racial profiling, and harassment from law enforcement. There are also a set of racial realities in Chicago beyond \"Black and white.\" The Latino/a/e/x community continues to experience racism in various forms based on race, immigration status, and language, which must be addressed. The city has a critical Indigenous community which has suffered historical marginalization, dispossession, and exclusion from power. The city must be deliberate and conscientious in correcting this trend and in addressing past wrongs, including in hiring, appointments, and decisions on public symbols. Diverse Asian communities and MENA (Middle East and North Africa) communities are growing in Chicago but have been under-represented in cultural, civic, and business leadership. In this area too, the city needs to make positive interventions to maximize inclusivity and equity and root out racism in all its forms. This, as several subcommittees point out, includes not just \"let's get along\" programs or cosmetic diversity programs, but hard-hitting interventions that get at structural racism built into our institutions and hierarchies of power. Another critical theme is \"intersectionality,\" a term borrowed from Black feminist writers and activists, but one that has wide resonance. What we mean by this is simply the interconnectedness of our various issues, issues, aspirations, and identities. None of us are one dimensional people, and our issues are not insular. For example, we cannot talk about a just housing policy without simultaneously talking about disability rights, economic justice, and race. They are not in competition with one another, they are all intimately related. The list goes on. An intersectional approach also means a coordinated approach. In order to achieve its goals, this administration will have to coordinate and work closely with state, federal and county partners. There are many entry points to tackling Chicago's many problems. We opted for eleven points of entry centered around sets of issues that have been of deep concern. These correlate to Mayor Johnson's ambitious and robust campaign commitments. Even though we live in difficult times and the new administration has serious problems to address, there are also many creative solutions. We only need the resources and the will to implement them. With a mindset of abundance, a collective spirit, and a willingness to work through our differences, we can move our city toward a more just and sustainable future. VALUES AND VISION The subcommittees have wrestled with ways to build bridges using shared problems and collective desires as building material. The Arts and Culture subcommittee indicated that where they could not initially reach consensus, they \"built new bridges and then covered them with art.\" That was not always the outcome in our groups. These are hard questions and there are different perspectives all around. This was an important and generative process, even though there is much more work to do in the months and years ahead. We are determined, however, that this report will not collect dust on a shelf. We intend for it to be a living document and a North Star for the Johnson administration to work toward. The vision and values articulated by the transition subcommittees are consistent with the vision and values uplifted by Mayor Johnson during his electoral campaign. The subcommittees advanced three large value sets that are consistent throughout the reports. The first value is the importance of the dual pillars of equity and inclusivity, and particularly racial justice. We are a big, beautifully eclectic, and disparate city. A celebration of diversity must be paired with an acknowledgement of Chicago's gross and persistent inequalities, and with concrete mechanisms to undo them. Mayor Johnson has spoken about Chicago being a tale of two cities with extreme disparities in access to resources (including health care, housing, and education), life chances, exposure CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 8 to violence, and overall quality of life. So, the goals of equity and inclusivity must be critical components of the building a just future for a city once referred to as the most segregated northern city in America, a city with a legacy of not only racial segregation but racial violence. We can learn from that legacy and build a better future. The second value that emerged and re-emerged in our committee work is the importance of a co-governance practice grounded in participatory democracy. Co-governance means that those communities and organizations on the frontlines of various issues need to be engaged in the work of defining, deciding, and implementing solutions that will address the suffering and injustice that they experience. Chicago has the opportunity to be a real pioneer in this regard. Finally, engagement and accountability are key. Each of the subcommittees remind us that all the good ideas in the world are worthless if we do not map and monitor implementation. This requires ongoing collaboration, co-creation, and engagement with communities. That is the core of co-governance, a principle to which our new mayor is deeply committed. It is not simply co-decision-making, but it is co-investment of time, ideas, energy, and heart. THEMES, ISSUES AND CHALLENGES FROM THE SUBCOMMITTEES Based on these values, we ask the question - what is our collective vision for this amazing city of ours? These highlights represent a small glimpse of what our subcommittees had to say in response. Fully resourced neighborhood schools are needed to make good on the goal of Education as a fundamental right for all, from pre-K through college. This must center those that have been historically marginalized: disabled students, Black and Latino/a/e/x students in underserved communities, undocumented and immigrant students, those for whom English is not their first language, LGBTQ students, unhoused students, alternative learners, and low-income students. Community colleges must be reimagined to be within reach of all our young people who want to attend. Policies must also honor the labor and dedication of educators at all levels. These were some of the highlights of a very detailed education report. \"Healthcare (including mental healthcare) for all\" must be more than a slogan. It must become our reality. The Health and Human Services subcommittee insists we focus our new policies on marginalized populations who are often neglected, and that the overall challenge is to develop an \"expansive integrated approach to problem solving public health issues,\" with an emphasis on coordination with other agencies on illness and harm prevention, like Cook County health care system. The subcommittee report defines violence overall as a public health issue, which should be treated as such. The healing, care and service model of crisis intervention reflected in the \"treatment not trauma\" concept is wholly consistent with the priorities and emphasis of the subcommittee. Housing should be a basic human right for all, and all Chicagoans should have safe, accessible, and stable shelter. That is a goal we have consensus on. The housing needs of Chicagoans exist on a spectrum. The City must create better pathways to secure and affordable homeownership, affordable rent, and policies that prevent the displacement of longtime residents for the sake of 'progress' and 'development.' We must ask what does fair and balanced development that benefits us all look like. Our unhoused neighbors, longtime and new arrivals, bear the brunt of the housing problem in the city and therefore must be our priority, their lives depend on it. We also seek to create conditions for those who have been pushed out of the city to feel able and welcome to return. The term, \"Bring Chicago Home,\" resonates in two ways: make 'homes' possible for all Chicagoans, and welcome back those who had to leave. The obstacles to realizing these goals are many, and are interwoven with other issues such as education, public safety, jobs, economic inequality, immigration status, and transportation. In additional to a cleaner, safer, more reliable public transportation trains and busses, accessibility and affordability at all levels, and ample bike paths, an expansive view of Transportation must also factor in racism (such as racial profiling in traffic stops). CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 9 Access to clean, safe reliable transportation is related to economic security, economic vitality and an overall cleaner environment. The transportation subcommittee insisted the City \"needs to work with community in planning transportation strategy.\" Again, the importance of engagement and ongoing accountability were uplifted in the transportation subcommittee report as they were in all the other groups. Our environmental justice subcommittee insists we take a holistic view of environmental issues including water safety, access to energy and safe housing, and issues of pollution and climate change. The issue of wealth disparity and racism resurface in this report as issues embedded in the way environmental issues have unfolded. Environmental racism is real. They invite us to see the rubric of a \"just transition,\" and the policy framework of a \"Green New Deal\" for Chicago as guiding principles for our efforts to realize a cleaner, healthier, more just, and sustainable city. Workers' Rights and Labor was the focus of another transition subcommittee. Workers' rights, including the right to organize, and workplace protections are fundamental to a vibrant economy and to healthy communities. And again, consistent with the values and vision of this overall report, an emphasis was placed on vulnerable and often marginalized workers and the importance of meeting their needs. It also pushes us to look to the future in our policy plans in terms of guaranteeing future career paths for our youth, as well as formerly incarcerate returning citizens and immigrant, disabled and LGBTQ workers. The Immigration subcommittee uplifted the city's pledge to become a welcoming city and a sanctuary city, while underscoring the fact that we need to make those commitments more robust. At the same time immigrant and migrant communities need housing, healthcare, and jobs, those needs overlap with those of non-immigrant communities, therefore we need an inclusive and holistic approach in which no group feels left behind. Investment in immigrant communities is critical and respecting our immigrant neighborhoods as contributors and full-fledged stakeholders in the city's future is essential. It is also important to note that Chicago's immigrant communities are not a monolith. They are ethnically, culturally, and religiously diverse, historically, and today. In addition to other needs, language access in all areas of city business is also key. Public Safety (and police accountability) was the largest subcommittee and had one of the most challenging tasks. To realize a safer, more peaceful, and just community is the goal of public safety. It was one of the most intensely debated issues of the mayoral campaign in Chicago and is a challenge that faces many big cities throughout the country as guns proliferate and violence grows. Three areas of consensus stand out in this subcommittee report. 1) The need to \"chart a new path to public safety,\" relying on community-based interventions, involving strategies to de-escalate conflicts to reduce harm, giving \"communities most impacted a meaningful voice, and addressing the related issues of mental health, economic disparity and disparate economic opportunities including lack of full-time year-round youth jobs, and gun proliferation exacerbated by the gun industry. 2) We cannot escape history. The subcommittee stresses the need to repair harm caused by past police practices and ongoing violence in various forms. This would include following through on full funding and support of the Chicago Torture Memorial and survivor services, and resources for the police district councils to insure greater community oversight and police accountability. 3) As Mayor Johnson has reiterated many times, our best crime and harm reduction strategy is to invest in people. We need full and expanded domestic violence services, overall investments in communities most impacted by violence, more first responder wellness and support programs, and employment and support services to formerly incarcerated persons to decrease recidivism and better facilitate community re-entry. Finally, during his campaign Mayor Johnson pledged to end programs that have not proven effective at crime and harm reduction and those which promote biased surveillance and/or violate basic rights. The City should also proceed swiftly with the implementation of the Consent Decree and ensure an ongoing policy of maximum data transparency for the public with all matters to do with public safety and policing. Each of the eight aforementioned subcommittees focused on a single set of issues as an entry point a larger set of intersecting issues. The overwhelming majority echo the need for greater transparency, community access to data, bringing marginal CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 10 constituencies to the center of our vision for the future, and engaging community members and organizations in decision- making (co-governance) as a way of insuring greater accountability on policy matters that impact our lives. The remaining three subcommittees cut across all the issue areas and highlight intersectionality as an anchoring approach to addressing social justice issues. The Human Rights, Equity, and Inclusion subcommittee calls for a deepening of our definition of \"equity,\" and reminds us of not only the ever-present legacy and reality of structural racism, including anti-Blackness, as other subcommittees do also, but underscoring the importance of strengthening services to, and inclusion of, the LGBTQ community and communities of people living with disabilities. The Economic Vitality and Equity subcommittee uplifts the importance of addressing wealth inequality as manifest in Mayor Johnson's references to the 'tale of two cities.' They suggest both conventional and innovative community-centered strategies to generate revenue, allocate resources, build community wealth, and combat poverty and all its attendant ills. Economic vitality and equity are essential to realize the goals of all the other subcommittees. Greater economic vitality will require revitalizing commercial corridors and galvanizing development and infrastructure improvements throughout our neighborhoods, with local advisory panels to make sure development projects meet community needs. A thriving downtown hub continues to be important, but one that feeds into neighborhood development and is accessible to all. And last, but not least, there is the work and provocations of our Arts and Culture subcommittee. Art holds up a mirror to show us who we are and provides a window to help us imagine a better future. It is also a site of bridge-building and individual and collective healing. So, our city must redouble its investment in the arts and protect and honor the labor of arts and creative workers, many of whom labor on the margins of economic security. Mayor Johnson has offered the biblical reflection that where one's heart is, there is your treasure. Art is the heart of this city in many ways and artists are key to helping us grow, build, unite and thrive. We must give them the security and resources to continue. LOOKING FORWARD: NEXT STEPS Our executive committee and subcommittees were comprised of very busy people who took time out to prioritize deliberations about the future of Chicago with an earnest group of fellow residents, many of them strangers. We will honor that sacrifice by making sure the recommendations here are kept alive and made meaningful through ongoing policies and practices. Some suggestions that rose organically from this process include, but are not limited to, the following. One suggestion is that a manageable, but representative, subgroup of our team of 400 be convened regularly (perhaps quarterly) to monitor and support progress toward the goals of the report. When appointed that group must accept and take seriously the responsibility of engaging not only their immediate community or organization but debriefing, reporting back and engaging with the broad ecosystem of community leaders and organizers in Chicago pushing for progressive change. Otherwise, there are individual representatives but again without full community input. Another suggestion is to schedule a one-year anniversary check-in to assess progress toward the recommendations in the report, and to have that event be public. A third suggestion is to build progress reports into ongoing, and widely publicized community engagement events and platforms. Attaining all the goals in this report might not be possible in the first hundred days or even the first year, but part of co- governance is transparency. Therefore, metrics to determine whether goals were met, and if not, why not, is a critical part of self-assessment, growth, and collaboration.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 11 Each subcommittee has offered a range of tiered recommendations and metrics for assessing progress. These recommendations are grounded in the expertise, experience and collective wisdom of hundreds of people who have invested decades of energy navigating, analyzing, and confronting these issues. We encourage the administration to build on and invest in these insights, and not only make specific staff assignments, but perhaps appoint a designated senior advisor responsible for this task only, to oversee implementation strategies, and to manage and monitor the specific recommendations. The revered Detroit activist Grace Lee Boggs once commented. \"These are times that grow men and women's souls.\" She spoke of the daunting problems that faced her city at that time, but also of the enormous soul growing opportunities that existed for bold and innovative change. We are in such a moment in Chicago. It is a time to break with business as usual, to break long standing silences and to make good on long overdue promises. This transition report is not a list of demands, but a blueprint for building a bridge to a better future. We pledge to work shoulder to shoulder with the mayor and his team to build that bridge.

Dr. Marshall Tai CO-CHAIRCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 12 Arts & CultureCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 22 Arts and Culture CONTEXT & HISTORICAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT \"Culture is a precious resource that requires careful attention. It is an integral part of Chicago's spirit and an underpinning of Chicago's economic well-being\" - Chicago Cultural Plan, Mayor Harold Washington, 1986. Chicago is where art and culture happens. It exists everywhere and every day, directly impacting our quality of life, economic prosperity, and educational excellence. Creativity and cultural production cannot be separated from the human experience, from learning and development, and from social and political context. In Chicago, segregated and disinvested communities experience limited access to arts education, community resources, jobs, and supportive infrastructure for building and sustaining healthy lives and communities. Within impacted communities, individuals with disabilities, seniors, teens, and young adults (18-24), LGBTQIA+, and new immigrants (especially those who are undocumented) experience barriers to employment, a lack of inclusive programming and limited accessibility of venues, preventing their full participation and engagement in the arts and culture ecosystem. Small independent BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) organizations and businesses, especially those within marginalized communities who operate as community anchors, are further impacted by limited funding, marketing, and integration into city planning. Non-unionized workers, including independent artists and cultural producers, as well as employees within larger mainstream institutions, are hindered by limited support structures to positively impact their working conditions and access to benefits. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 23 Increased arts and culture funding and support toward historically disinvested neighborhoods frequently contributes to gentrification and displacement of long-time residents, including artists and cultural practitioners, eroding history, heritage, and cultural contributions that ensure connectedness and neighborhood vibrancy. This displacement disrupts engagement and further marginalizes artists and creatives from government-supported initiatives. The Johnson administration has a unique opportunity to facilitate healing conversations and promote collaboration between groups that have historically been on opposite sides of gentrification and displacement through inclusive planning. We ask the Mayor to not undervalue these critical opportunities to bring us together and bolster our reputation as a world-class city, and to invest -and fully include - culture and the arts as a serious driver of economic development, tax base and jobs for the city, giving it the voice, placement, and reporting structure in government that it deserves and needs in order to be most effective. NUMBERS AND NARRATIVES Chicago's nonprofit arts and culture organizations have traditionally had smaller budgets and received less local government funding compared to organizations in other metropolitan areas. Furthermore, national research has made clear that art and culture are the fourth hardest amenities to access after jobs, housing, and transportation for people of color and adults on low incomes. Many of the nonprofit arts and culture entities in Chicago are concentrated in the Loop area and along the lakefront. This concentration can lead to a disparity in opportunities and benefits, as residents in many neighborhoods may not have equal opportunities to engage with and benefit from the economic, educational, and quality-of-life contributions of the city's arts and culture scene. Additionally, it is important to note that many artists and residents are unaware of the opportunities DCASE (Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events) and other city agencies provide to support their arts and cultural activities. We need to think about arts & culture more expansively than we previously have. We should be thinking about it as a part of the \"creative economy.\" In 2015 (per DCASE report), the arts and culture sector generated $3.2 billion in total economic activity, $336.5 million in local and state government revenue, and created 85,000 creative jobs. The CPS (Chicago Public Schools) Arts Education Plan 1 (CPS, 2012) was initiated to create a policy and programming blueprint for increasing access, equity, and the quality of arts education. The development and implementation of the plan was one of the district's leading strategies for engaging young people, to keep them in school and to provide them with the instruction needed to graduate into the professional world. The Plan recommends one full-time certified and/or endorsed arts instructor for each school, or an improved teacher-student ratio. Even with legislation that includes arts as a core subject in schools, the arts are often still relying on nonprofit programming support, celebrity donations, and teacher-purchased supplies. A Creative Worker Survey 2 (DCASE, 2022) distributed to over 300 artists found that 63% of the creative workers engaged with DCASE were BIPOC. Over 100 artists participated in creating the first Chicago Arts Census in partnership with ACRE (Artists' Cooperative Residency and Exhibitions), Annas, DataMade, C.A.M.P, and Sixty Inches from Center, and over 1,000 arts workers shared their stories through the census survey on their challenges and lived experiences of being an arts worker in our city. Therefore, the arts and culture committee has compiled a list of recommendations that could assist the new administration in furthering its policy goals; they are as follows:CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 24 Goal #1: Fully-integrate arts and culture strategies into all economic development, health, safety, housing, workforce, and community resilience efforts The following recommendations are - taken altogether - designed to nourish and invigorate our diverse arts and culture sector, drive economic development and tourism, enrich the creative lives of children and adults, leverage the sector to enhance neighborhood identity and health, strengthen the well-being of the cultural workforce, and enrich the spirit and pride of our residents. If this goal is achieved, the diversity of Chicago's cultural assets is highlighted and valued. Arts & culture are actively shifting harmful narratives about Chicago locally, nationally, and internationally. With the support of public and private partnership and investment, Chicago's arts ecosystem is respected as a key component and thought partner in the economic development of Chicago's neighborhoods, particularly in historically disinvested communities. Chicago residents are visiting more neighborhoods across the city outside of the areas where they live and work. Chicago leads the nation's major cities in not just funding support but strategic, structural integration (i.e. on the 5th floor) of arts and culture across economic development, tourism, transportation, community safety, immigration, education, and labor. DCASE will focus its efforts and continue to partner with organizations across the city to delegate resources to those organizations that are closer to the work in communities (and less restricted by government bureaucracy), specifically those with racialized and marginalized residents. The 77 community CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 25 areas of Chicago and their unique histories and identities are recognized and uplifted. Other cities look to Chicago as a model for building a culture of repair, supporting artists in creating and activating public sites to confront and heal pain within our communities, especially pain caused by state and city governments. Every neighborhood has an arts corridor with active and accessible cultural spaces as a part of other infrastructural initiatives to ensure sustainability and not marginalize \"cultural spaces\" to beautification projects. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: E nsuring $10 million from Corporate Fund remains consistent source of funding specifically for grant distribution at DCASE F acilitating third-party assessment to evaluate value and viability of the creation of Deputy Mayor of Arts, Culture, and Heritage to oversee and coordinate integration of arts and culture across city efforts, shepherd equitable business investments, and oversee city-wide cultural vibrancy on par with other American and international cities C reating a Deputy Commissioner of Nighttime Business in BACP (Business Affairs and Consumer Protection) R eviewing the budget allocated to the Chicago Film Office (within DCASE) as we see significant opportunity in film and TV as an economic and job creation driver for the city B reaking ground on the Chicago Torture Justice Memorials on the site proposed by lead organizers E nabling DCASE to have the authority to leverage funding and contract capacity-building delegate agencies to expand what DCASE can do with limited staff Incr easing baseline public support for arts from other city departments to support arts and culture initiatives, with attention to ARPA-funded initiatives E nsuring that World Business Chicago and Choose Chicago both have representation from the cultural sector and/or creative economy at a board level to connect the business, arts and culture, and tourism communities to attract incoming conferences and conventions C reating a working group within World Business Chicago with representatives from the creative economy, arts, culture, business, tourism, and real estate development communities together to come up with new models of support for cultural production, funded by a % of permitting fees or tax dollars generated from instruments such as TIF (Tax Increment Financing) or NOFCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 26 In tandem wi th targeted marketing campaigns, developing a city-wide asset map highlighting the many different spaces, artists, genres, and opportunities for engaging with arts and culture across Chicago. This aggregation exists in the private sector so we encourage those partnerships instead of investing in any DCASE rebranding or website adjustments Adhering to r ecommendations made by the Chicago Monuments Project's Advisory Committee in their final report, including removal of Columbus statues and other monuments that reinforce white supremacy and stereotypes of American Indians LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: B uilding upon the work of the previous administration, continue to include arts and culture in the city's capital bond during the next bonding cycle (2025) R eviewing results of the third-party assessment for the potential creation of a Deputy Mayor of Arts, Culture, and Heritage, whose charge would be to serve as the cross-city/agency/sector champion for the value of arts and culture, to ensure the city is livable for all residents and a vital world-class destination F unding accessibility upgrades in long-standing venues and non-traditional community art spaces in collaboration with the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities U tilizing the Chicago Torture Justice Memorials as a model for funding new monuments and activating public spaces as sites for remediation, reparations, and storytelling, in partnership with directly impacted communities and social justice organizations. M easuring resident and tourist engagement with arts and cultural activities, including the number of visits to museums, galleries, libraries, and cultural and heritage sites. This should include the number of public art installations/refurbishments, the use of public spaces for cultural events, and participation in community-based arts and cultural initiatives GOALS: R ecognize unique needs between daytime and nighttime businesses by supporting nightlife operators, workers, performers, patrons, and residents to address their challenges and see increase in equitable businesses and partnerships Incr ease awareness about harm done historically to police torture survivors and Chicagoans due to systemic racism and oppression, creating visual representations of restorative justice, collective healing, and the city's commitment to a just Chicago Mi tigate burden on DCASE's grants team and shared city resources such as comptroller's office C onvene nighttime businesses across the city to come up with solutions that feel equitable and create space for knowledge sharing, partnership, and mentorship CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 27 C onvene a coalition from community-based (such as the Chicago Cultural Alliance), mid- and large-sized museums and institutions annually to transparently report audience numbers and discuss ways to cross promote one another and collaborate - co-led by DCASE Commissioner, Head of Choose Chicago, and respective board chairs METRICS: M easure increases in link clicks, impressions, and social media engagement outside of DCASE platforms for DCASE-issued grant applications Pr ogress check on status of public monuments in Chicago Estab lish a report to assess number of re-granting organizations DCASE is partnering with now and set benchmarks for increase for 1, 2 and 3 years from now - this also promotes public/private partnership Call on Choose Chi cago, DCASE and the State DCEO to collaborate on and disaggregate economic data around the creative economy STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE: Business community (specifically Real Estate), Marketing and Comms community, monument and memorial focused institutions, cultural asset mapping organizations, large arts institutions, artist-run spaces, private philanthropy (large to medium-sized foundations), Business Affairs and Consumer Protection (BACP), Department of Planning & Development (DPD), Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE), Deputy Mayor of Business and Neighborhood Development, third party consultants. Goal #2: Ensure all Chicagoans have equitable access to robust and joyful arts and culture education at every stage of their lives. If this goal is achieved, every Chicagoan will have the opportunity to benefit from art and creativity at every stage of their life. Arts education is understood as life-giving and an important and proven tool for navigating the emotional and mental health impact caused, in part, by COVID-19. Chicago students will experience a Chicago Public School system that embraces creative education as a core asset in nearly every subject at every school and recognizes the power of investment in this form of learning and engagement. Reading and math scores are not only improved across all CPS schools, but the process to get there is humane and empathetic in approach, making schools a healing, welcoming, and nurturing space for all our young people. Arts learning and engagement extends beyond the classroom to after- and out-of-school programming with alternative learning spaces, particularly for marginalized communities such as the elderly, 17- to 24-year-olds, recent immigrants, and formerly incarcerated individuals. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Addr essing disparities in available arts education across all CPS schoolsCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 28 Securing mor e diverse, sustainable, and consistent funding, such as implementing revenue-generating tax like the Digital Ad Tax, for funding equitable arts education programs across the city E nsuring CPS's new accountability measuring tool, Accountability Standards (replacing School Quality Rating Policy) includes arts education as a valuable priority in all schools C reating opportunities for exchanges between community-based artists and Chicago youth, bringing artists into schools, classrooms, and after- and out-of-school programming, and bringing youth to artists' workspaces LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS : C reating additional spaces throughout the city for youth to experience and engage with art C reating new funding programs that fill gaps that currently exist in private sector arts education funding, such as intergenerational programs and adult arts education C reating and investing in alternative learning spaces that are not tied to CPS curriculum constraints, including creating infrastructure and opportunities for opening up underutilized spaces in neighborhoods for community arts learning programs U tilizing CPS data to determine larger community arts education access needs, particularly for non-K-12 Chicagoans, older adults, immigrants, neurodivergent populations, and formerly incarcerated individuals METRICS: U tilize CPS data to identify under-resourced schools and prioritize accordingly Estab lish an opportunity and/or mandate for an annual review of CPS's new accountability measuring tool that includes students, parents, art educators, and others at the table CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 29 Incr ease transparency between CPS data collection and organizations such as Ingenuity, DFSS (Department of Family and Support Services), My Chi My Future, to better map data by need and use strategically U tilize data available through the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment of the Humanities, and IMLS to identify, partner with, and amplify opportunities across and culture programs, public spaces, and organizations. U se SPED and low score testing data to prioritize need STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE: BIPOC community-based organizations and leaders, teaching artists, DCASE, CPS (Chicago Public Schools), Chicago Theatre, Chicago Park District, Chicago Public Library, Ingenuity, and historically well-resourced institutions (i.e. the Art Institute, Field Museum, etc.) Goal # 3: Significantly increase livability and technical assistance support for people who work in arts and culture. If this goal is achieved, Chicago will lead the nation's major cities in funding support for arts and culture practitioners, recognizing that support must also include access to affordable housing, transportation, health and wellness, skills training, and accessible live/workspaces. The Johnson administration's worker-centered platform uniquely places people's livelihoods at the forefront. Artists, arts workers, and cultural producers see Chicago as a destination and a homebase to live, work, build their careers, and raise their families with the support of a robust and well-cared for arts ecosystem. Arts and culture workers are considered a vital part of Chicago's creative workforce. Arts workers are included in program eligibility, artists are recognized as part of the small business sector, creative businesses as small businesses, and resources are abundant for all. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: C reating an Arts & Culture Project Management Organization (PMO) to hire small, local marketing businesses and local ambassadors/influencers to better market DCASE and other city funding opportunities to the arts and culture sector P artnering with existing privately funded initiatives like the Exploring Possibilities for Collective Intent working group and the Chicago Arts Census to create data-backed advocacy, policy, and coalition building to better support Chicago's arts workers, exploring ways for arts workers to collectively organize to access benefits that they are currently denied, receive unemployment protection, and inclusion in affordable housing accessCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 30 Incl uding creative workforce in existing labor conversations already underway, ensuring arts and culture practitioners are involved in the shaping and framing of workforce support programs and pilots E nsuring that funding opportunities reach multidisciplinary, non-commercial artists, not excluding artists or cultural practitioners operating in spaces where activism, community support, and creativity intersect, particularly support for artists facilitating art-centered healing and transformative justice spaces In vesting in capacity building for arts-centered and cultural and ethnic-focused organizations (such as the 40+ organization members in the Chicago Cultural Alliance) often operating on a shoestring budget LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: R evisiting the Cultural Bill of Rights, expanding it to encompass the rights of art and cultural workers to have equitable pay, healthcare, and affordable housing Bo lstering existing efforts to simplify DCASE grant application processes in collaboration with an independent artist team; identify barriers that can be removed, language that can be clarified, and ways the programs and applications can be more user-friendly overall Incr easing unrestricted grants for individuals; in the same way that general operating support is important for small and mid- sized organizations, this allows practitioners the ability to create and thrive C reating a fund for technical assistance initiatives for creative business owners C reating greater access to affordable studio space for artists, which could be achieved in part by expanding definition of cultural initiatives eligible under Neighborhood Opportunity Fund (NOF) GOALS: T o promote transparency and set equitable compensation standards for art workers across the city with city backing CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 31 Incr ease equity and visibility in DCASE's processes of disseminating opportunities and funding to marginalized communities METRICS: The cr eation of fair pay guidelines for commissioned work at DCASE is completed and made public R einstatement of Universal Basic Income programs and pilots to include eligibility for arts and culture workers M onitor the support provided to local artists and creative practitioners, including number of grants, fellowships, commissions, and residencies awarded across all agencies, as well as the availability of affordable studio spaces and training resources for artists M easure dollars: How much revenue are we generating from film / TV? M easure local workforce: How many film / TV jobs are originating in Chicago versus outsourcing from other states? S urvey to BIPOC nighttime venue owners: How much revenue is coming in from your businesses? Where are your businesses geographically? Incr ease in grant funds towards artists in facilitation, transformative/restorative justice, and accountability processes to support community art making R eview and update all grant-formulas to ensure updated attention to COLA (cost of living), health insurance and care (childcare, adult care, etc.) for part time and contract workers STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE: City Council, DCASE, Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership, IATSE, other labor institutions and unions, BACP, Deputy Mayor of Labor, World Business Chicago, Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO), Chicago Arts Census organizers, DCASE grant applicants, delegated nonprofit intermediaries e, and art and culture workers impacted within the creative workforce. BRIDGES LEFT TO BUILD: There were points raised about the extractive nature of the Film industry, and the need for a community impact assessment where Film/TV operate in Chicago. ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS RECOMMENDATION FOR TRANSITION ACCOUNTABILITY WORKING GROUP CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 32 W e recommend a working group to meet with DCASE and the Cultural Advisory Council on an annual basis to review the progress, challenges, and growth areas of the transition team's recommendations for arts & culture.

We will see economic growth, reduction of crime, an elimination of the racial wealth gap, and a thriving mix of large and small businesses in every single neighborhood. The City of Chicago will be a global example of how to be an attractive business and talent destination while building an inclusive and more just economy, both in its central business district and all its neighborhoods. All Chicago residents, including and especially BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) Chicagoans and women, will have access and opportunity to high-quality jobs with pathways for careers that have opportunities for upward mobility. Chicago will become a thriving economic global powerhouse and hub for innovation across our core growth industry sectors. Entrepreneurs, business owners and developers of all sizes and backgrounds from every neighborhood of the city will benefit from an efficient, effective, flexible, and transparent local government without encountering unnecessary roadblocks. Any entrepreneur from any background can start and grow a successful business that creates wealth and jobs in Chicago, and all can access the capital, support, and customers they need to grow. CONTEXT & HISTORICAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT Chicago is a world-class city home to a diverse population with a low cost-of-living compared to peer cities and a broad regional economy that literally rivals nations. The 2022 Global Cities Index ranks the Chicago metro as 7th in the world, just behind Los Angeles and Beijing. We have conflicting narratives about our city's economic reality. On one hand, we have a thriving economy with the 2nd most Fortune 500 companies of any U.S. city; over the last 2 years we saw over 100 corporate relocations and over 200 significant corporate expansions; in 2021 & 2022 we received record level of investment influx into Chicago based startups (close to $20B in Venture Capital and Private Equity Investments in each year). On the other hand, we continue to see a significant gap in wealth, CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 37 employment, and opportunities between decades-long underinvested neighborhoods on the South & West sides and the rest of the city, resulting in inequitable access to housing, education, justice, and healthcare along racial and ethnic lines. The root cause of racialized inequity as described by UIC Institute for Research on Race & Public Policy report, A Tale of Three Cities: The State of Racial Justice in Chicago, is grounded in Chicago's historical inequitable private investment patterns and lack of equal government focus preventing the city from achieving inclusive growth across all 77 neighborhoods. Private investment has historically been directed towards wealthy, largely white communities and/or the central business district, resulting in disinvested Black, Latino, Native American, Asian, and Middle Eastern North African (MENA) communities, income inequality, and higher unemployment for these same communities. Moreover, we know that the interconnected nature of race, class, and gender creates overlapping and interdependent systems of discrimination and/or disadvantage. Economic vitality and equity centers on the belief that utilizing both conventional and innovative means, we can and must ensure that all Chicago residents have access to good jobs, housing, services, and the resources that they need to survive and thrive. Much of the economic prosperity that we have seen in Chicago over the past half century has benefitted white residents. This has led to economic disparities among racial and ethnic groups to be wider today than in the Civil Rights Era. The poverty rate in Chicago is over 30% for Black families and around 25% for Latinx families. However, less than 10% of white residents live under the poverty line. 3 Decades of structural racism have led to underinvestment of the South and West sides, and it is the government's role to step in where both the public and private sector have failed our communities. While this administration cannot undo generations of disinvestment in four years, it must robustly move in the direction of greater economic equity while ensuring that Chicago invests in community wealth building initiatives, thriving local entrepreneurship, and homegrown institutions and businesses, - including Black, Latinx, and Native businesses, and remains a welcoming & attractive business destination for corporations and investments. This work must rest upon the principle of \"people before profit\" and a deep and grounded understanding that investing in people - especially those most in need - is an investment in our collective future and economic growth. The City must engage in aggressive community-led and co-created efforts to create avenues for greater economic vibrancy and security for those who are economically insecure and more vulnerable to crime and other crises as a result. At the same time, the administration needs to ensure economic growth across our key industry sectors to remain competitive, both nationally and globally, to grow and attract new corporations, talent, and capital. Only a growing and inclusive economy will ensure financial stability and the means to invest in the marginalized communities and neighborhoods across the city. NUMBERS & NARRATIVES Chicago has a long history of radicalized geographical inequities, and we see the consequences of this disparity throughout econometric data, like private capital investments, net worth, unemployment, income, and poverty levels. The Urban Institute examined investments into various neighborhoods in Chicago from 2010 to 2020 and found disparities between locations based on racial representation. Predominantly Black neighborhoods - those with 81% of residents identifying as Black - received the lowest average annual investment dollars per household, $7,800. Predominantly Latinx neighborhoods only received an average annual investment of $11,000 per household. Predominantly white neighborhoods received an average annual investment of $32,000 per household. This lack of investment translates to lower overall household net worth. Across the US, Black and Latinx households have a lower net worth in 2020. White households have a median net worth of $178,000, while Black and Latinx households have a median net worth of $18,000 and $39,000, respectively. Looking across all asset classes, the greatest disparities appear in home and other real estate equity, and value of investment accounts. While the Chicago metro area has an average unemployment rate of 4.5%, we have within Chicago's 77 community areas, 37 - almost half - with unemployment rates over 10%. 4 These areas are all on the South and West sides of the city. The unemployment rate in 2021 for Chicago's Black population (16%) was triple that of Chicago's white population (5%). CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 38 Unemployment rates for Chicago's Latinx (8%) and Native American (8%) populations were nearly double that of Chicago's white population (5%). The unemployment rate for Chicago's young adults, ages 18-39, was over 9%, the highest among all age groups. With all of this in mind, the Economic Vitality and Equity Committee has compiled a list of recommendations that could assist the new administration in furthering its policy goals; they are as follows: Goal #1: Build City processes that are efficient, transparent, community-centered, cross- collaborative, all in support of a growing a transformative and inclusive economy. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: I dentify top 3 administrative barriers for small businesses- particularly Black, Latinx, and Native-owned and community- driven development projects and work with each City department and a working group of impacted partners, to conduct an audit and develop a plan to address these challenges- including staffing needs, inter-departmental collaboration, approval complexity and speed, and opportunities to improve how the City supports these partners within existing budgets. Assess curr ent economic development subsidy programs and develop criteria to determine which projects are prioritized and expedited for funding and approval, particularly among small businesses and developers who grow out of these communities and those seeking to invest in Black, and Latinx, neighborhoods. Design all r elevant City policies and programs with community institutions and small businesses, not for or around them, so that City Hall departments and City Council members make creating community wealth easier. F or large institutions that receive public support, create transparency in job projections, local hiring efforts, and how much they purchase from diverse entrepreneurs to create true business diversity in our City. Estab lish a Department of Neighborhood Equity and Repair. It would report directly to the Deputy Mayor of Neighborhood & Economic Development and house the City's commitment to improving livability among our most vulnerable communities. Dr iven by racial justice data and outreach among communities, this Department should establish Community Development Councils that would help neighborhoods create, refine, and implement new and existing Quality of Life Plans. W ork to expand and increase investment in the city's Community Wealth Building Initiative to support development projects that are community-led and collectively owned. I t should continue to assess and refine strategic investments before expanding \"Invest South/West,\" and house key initiatives including Climate and the Office of Equity and Racial Justice. U tilize the Public Building Commission to advance more Municipal developments beyond libraries and firehouses in disproportionate impacted communities. (Municipal Markets- Food, Resilience Hub- Emergency Climate) Estab lish the Office of the Ombudsman to coordinate the development process across City departments. This Office would offer concierge ser vice and technical assistance to community-driven developers and entrepreneurs seeking to invest in previously underinvested neighborhoods, particularly Black, Latino, Indigenous, and immigrant communities, and improve processes for these partners to move forward on their projects more efficiently. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 39 This office would create a regular con vening of government agencies across all levels and geographies to ensure coordination of resources and processes. T o streamline approval processes for community-driven projects among underinvested neighborhoods, it would establish hiring criteria for senior leaders to focus on innovation, collaboration, and racial equity, and steward solutions to reduce unnecessary regulations and restrictions that impede growth and participation among small businesses, particularly home-grown entrepreneurial ventures. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATION : Digi tize the procurement process. GOALS TO MEASURE PROGRESS: C reate an Equity Score for all city programs and initiatives. B uild closer internal and external government cooperation by promoting inter- and intra-governmental collaboration and building strategic partnerships with large businesses, financial institutions, and anchor institutions. In vest in flexible government processes and systems that cede power back to the community. Define end goals in app lications. S mall business owners consider Chicago to be a great place to do business, in Chicago overall and with a focus in Black, Latino and other historically marginalized communities. METRICS FOR SUCCESS: Pub lic and private investment, increased wealth (assets). Incr eased buy-in from city, county, and state executives. R eduction in redundancies across city processes. Length of time to r eceive a building permit, business license and payments by Community Area. T rack growth in new business licenses across geographies and by race/ethnicity and gender, to allow the City to track parity. S urvey businesses who interact with the City - when acquiring or renewing licensees, or applying for or receiving financial assistance - to ask if Chicago is a great place to do business, and track whether the net promoter score for this question is at or above 8 out of 10 over time. The pr oportion of institutional contracts secured by diverse entrepreneurs is growing each year.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 40 KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO BE ENGAGED: Each community should be able to present, collectively, what it wants to invest in, through an intersectional community council that includes permanent stakeholders and residents. We also need representatives from our small business community, the local Chambers of Commerce, university leaders, and representatives from labor. Goal #2: Invest in innovative solutions to address capital needs, particularly among underserved communities and small businesses. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Estab lish a working group/task force of a broad range of economic experts to study the concept of, and develop recommendations on, the establishment of a Public Bank to address the lack of capital that is accessible in Black communities, along with Latino, other immigrant, and low-income communities. This working group should also address alternative sources of funds to support these plans including facilitating the expansion of private and nonprofit lending and philanthropic investment in Black, Latino, and Native American communities. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Launch innovative so lutions to address the funding gap for smaller businesses and Black & Latinx real estate developments in underserved communities, including: E xplore opportunities for social impact bonds to leverage investment in underserved communities and underfunded public institutions, including the concept of a pension obligation bond mandate to allocate a minimum percentage towards real estate projects in underserved communities. W ork with philanthropic stakeholders to increase the allocation and flexibility of funding for local CDFIs. K eep a portion of City Pension Fund assets invested in Chicago real estate developments with the mandate of hiring local residents from under-resourced and underserved communities. GOALS TO MEASURE PROGRESS: S mall business owners and developers secure the capital they need, in Chicago overall and on the South and West sides. S mall business starts are growing faster each year, in Chicago overall and on the South and West sides, than the national average.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 41 METRICS FOR SUCCESS: B usiness ownership, especially to track measurable progress for Black, Latino, Indigenous, and women-owned businesses. S urvey businesses who interact with the City - when acquiring or renewing licensees or applying for or receiving financial assistance - to ask if they have sought specific forms of capital over the last 12 months and if so whether they secured the amount they required. T rack relevant dollars disbursed vs. dollars committed each year across geographies and homegrown businesses. The pr oportion of City financing disbursed to small, homegrown businesses relative to what was budgeted is growing each year, in Chicago overall and on the South and West Sides. C onduct an annual survey of large institutions that receive public support to track how much of their spending was invested in diverse Chicago entrepreneurs, disaggregated by industry and entrepreneur demographics. KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE: Developers of color and mission-driven developers, small business community, community leaders, intersectional community council. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 42 Goal #3: Invest in equitable and inclusive workforce development strategies to build resilient economic clusters and communities. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Estab lish and convene a multi-stakeholder committee with employers, businesses, educational partners, workforce development, workers' rights, and community organizations to create a new model to make all jobs into \"good jobs,\" jobs that raise working families' living standards and intentionally benefit historically excluded workers and communities.5 This committee will define and research what makes a good job, through focus groups composed of people with lived experiences, to surface solutions. Its objective will be to connect workers to jobs with thriving wages. The committee will include Chicagoland businesses for this work and celebr ate models of 'good' employers, accelerate their growth, foster respectful work sites that address harassment, and remove language barriers in recruitment and programming. This committee will make recommendations of where C ity funds and investments should be leveraged to grow the number of \"good jobs\" and \"good employers\" in Chicago. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: I dentify and remove barriers that prevent BIPOC Chicagoans and women from obtaining and thriving in these jobs, such as addressing the childcare needs for all residents via leveraging City funds and investments. C reate Local Career Pipelines that engage students, both in high schools and other target population programs like ESL programs, to create paid apprenticeships to trades, manufacturing, technology, healthcare, and other sustainable careers, including tracking and reporting on local career pipeline, with a goal to increase percentages. GOALS TO MEASURE PROGRESS: The n umber of successful job placements within Chicago small businesses is growing, in Chicago overall and on the South and West sides.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 43 METRICS FOR SUCCESS: U nemployment rates, measured across race/ethnicity and gender M edian wages/incomes, measured across race/ethnicity and gender W orkforce in \"good jobs\" reflect the diversity of the city R educed discrepancies in the unemployment rate by neighborhood (currently ranges from 2-25%) T rack job postings from small business owners vs. job placements with City or County assistance each year across geographies. C onduct an annual survey of small businesses who accepted City workforce assistance, and track whether the net promoter score for this question is at or above 8 out of 10 over time. KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE: Workforce solutions should be co-designed with employers, labor unions, worker centers, educational partners, workforce development, workers' rights, and community organizations representing survivors of particular harms. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 44 Goal#4: Promote Chicago's unique assets and amplify positive narratives across every neighborhood to attract businesses, talent, capital, and industry. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: U se the profile of Mayor Johnson to align stakeholders and actively promote the city as an attractive place to start and expand a business, relocate businesses, build a career, and invest capital across every neighborhood and sector. Estab lish a plan to change the narrative about Chicago in a way that celebrates our diverse and unique cultural richness while highlighting our quality-of-life advantages.

We should also engage community organizations, churches and other non-profits that are invested in our communities. Goal #5: Build out an economic growth strategy that focuses on equitable prosperity. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Doub le down on our core industries (manufacturing, life sciences, transportation and logistics, food innovation, finance, and technology as the core enabler across all these industries) with a strong focus on equitable prosperity that provides access to job opportunities & professional growth across all Chicago neighborhoods and accelerates a closing of the wealth gap between the different resident groups of Chicago. Additionally, we suggest using emerging industries like Cannabis as a role model for truly inclusive growth, connecting sector growth in communities with high unemployment E nsure Chicago as a top destination for tourism, conventions, and business meetings that benefits all neighborhoods, including encouraging DCASE (Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events) and Choose Chicago to support home grown cultural events on the South & West side to build attractions beyond the CBD W ork with our Chicago sport franchises to create both more place centric entertainment districts driving economic growth (e.g., Wrigley field) AND investments in primarily Black, Brown, and Native communities on the South & West sides C reate multiple initiatives to make Chicago a Black Hub for our growing industries (see Atlanta's growth strategy), including considering housing incentives for graduates from HBCU's to locate in Chicago, and putting a focused spotlight on the creative story tellers and creators as part of the \"creative industry\" LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Incr ease the tax base of Chicago by growing its population to over 3 million, increasing the number of businesses, both large and small, in Chicago, and attracting more capital investments enabling a fairer distribution of tax burden across the city's residents, property owners (both commercial and residential), and businesses W ork with public/private sectors to increase the size of the City's tax base and make our tax system more equitable, including by reducing the dependency on property taxes I dentify a few billion-dollar investment initiatives that bring public and private collaboration that put Chicago on a trajectory towards a highly attractive and globally admired city while benefiting all residents. This effort needs to include the integrated pursuit of federal grant & investment opportunities (e.g., Chips Act) by the city's, regional, and state economic development organizations, the various academic institutions, community organizations, and the private sector B uild an industrial policy that addresses workforce development, land use, and industrial investments in a way that balances the need for economic growth with equity goals and the needs of the community. This industrial policy needs to include CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 46 growing and enabling job opportunities for our residents without a college degree.

Efforts to maintain segregation have been a mainstay of public policy since the Great Black Migration at the turn of the 20th century. Efforts to enact school reform have been no different. In 1995, the Illinois General Assembly began the era of Mayoral control for the Chicago Public Schools by giving then Mayor, Richard M. Daley, the power to unleash an era of school reform focused on accountability, high stakes testing, austere budgets and zero tolerance policies. Since 2002, Chicago Mayors have closed, reconstituted and turned-around (when all staff are fired and rehired) over 200 schools, overwhelmingly in the Black community. These actions created immense harm, disrupted learning, exacerbated violence, increased displacement, and undermined confidence in one of our most treasured institutions.1 During the same period, the Chicago Public Schools opened almost the same number (193) of privatized charter, military and contract schools.2 This process also decreased the number of Black teachers from 43 percent of the district to 20 percent today. Additionally, during this period, students with disabilities faced illegal budget cuts to their services under the budget cuts of Rahm Emanuel's administration, from 2016-18, which led to state oversight by the Illinois State Board of Education. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 53 The subsequent protests, coalition efforts and revival of strikes demanded greater equity and investment in public education. This 20-year phase of resistance culminated in the election of the city's first educator Mayor, Brandon Johnson, someone who organized against the original school closings and participated in the (2015) Dyett Hunger Strike to reopen a closed school for the first time during this 20 year period. We have come full circle. Instead of closures and privatization the Johnson administration shouldinvest in children and build a sustainable community school district where every child has the ability to attend a free, public institution, from birth through college, within walking distance from their homes with equitable staffing, services, after school programming, course offerings and educational opportunities to counteract the historical inequities faced by BIPOC families and students. This new and holistic approach is more important than ever in a district that continues to see BIPOC students disproportionately impacted by violence, the school to prison pipeline, economic disparities and dropping enrollment, with 92,300 fewer Black students in CPS today than in 2002. Additionally, 20,000 students experiencing homelessness, and 4,000 newcomers this year alone, require housing, special education, language services, and more.3 All of these issues have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring more resources and personnel to address the growing needs of a student body already besieged by inequality. In a school system that is a majority Latine (46.6%) and Black (37.8%), CPS schools are segregated by race and ethnicity as well as poverty. About 91% of Black students and 89% of Latine students attend schools where 75% or more of the student population are eligible for free or reduced lunch and face the greatest environmental contamination, abusive discipline practices such as restraint and seclusion, inadequate staffing and services for students with disabilities, insufficient housing supports, a lack of Black and Latine educators, obstacles to obtaining a college degree, disproportionate numbers of suspensions and expulsions, and a dearth of culturally relevant materials.4 We hope this examination of our educational landscape will be a living and breathing document that sparks conversation and transformation with and for the young people who are on the front lines creating a city that reflects our fundamental needs and dreams. VISION: As a former teacher, Mayor Johnson will work to ensure that every student in Chicago\u2014regardless of their race, income or zip code\u2014receives a fully resourced, equitable, safe, and healthy learning environment. The next 4 years will advance our goal to make public education accessible to all of Chicago's youth from birth through college. Chicago is a decade removed from the greatest closure of Black and Latine schools in our city's history. The new administration rejects the failed and racist policies of the past. Instead, the administration will seek to establish sustainable community schools from birth to the City Colleges, providing academic, health and social support beyond the school day. This will address the needs of our students experiencing homelessness, bilingual and ESL students, students with disabilities and the need to create an educator pipeline that corresponds with the racial makeup and cultural needs of our student body. Building sustainable community schools alongside quality affordable housing and tackling the violence epidemic, with more holistic measures that provide resources and trauma intervention for students and families, will create an environment for students to thrive in their schools and on their blocks. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 54 School communities need direct investment and guarantees of staffing and program offerings. Every school should have a library and librarian, adequate clinicians and counselors, thriving arts offerings and sports programs and teams. The Mayor of Chicago embraces his obligation to be actively fighting in partnership for the revenue required to fulfill those basic needs for every school in the city. TO GET THE SCHOOLS CHICAGO STUDENTS DESERVE, WE HAVE 5 GOALS: 1. Loving, Liberator y, and Fully Staffed Schools 2. A J ust city for our students, families and their communities. 3. Democratic and peop le powered school governance 4. Progressive reven ue to drive equity and fuel investment in young people 5. R obust college and career programming and pipelines KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE: Key stakeholders to engage include students (particularly those who are most impacted by current disparities including Black and brown students, English Language Learners, students with disabilities, etc.), youth council members, parents/guardians/families (particularly those who are most impacted by current disparities, Local School Council members, community based providers, community members, teachers/other school personnel (bus drivers, custodians, etc.)/administrators, clinicians, district and private early childhood educators. The education committee has compiled a list of recommendations that could assist the new administration in furthering its policy goals; they are as follows: CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 55 Goal #1: Loving, liberatory, and fully staffed schools Every community will have the resources required to dismantle learning systems built on scarcity. In community, we will co-create the schools our young people deserve. Our schools will champion the individual cultures, identities, talents, abilities, languages, and interests of each student. In our schools student needs will be met. In our schools, we will: R ecognize the intellectual curiosity, personal passions, and dynamic diversity of our students as an asset, not a deficit; Devel op and expand program and school models that meet specific student needs, while deepening connection to neighborhoods; Define and support studen t success holistically, investing in culturally- and linguistically- relevant curriculum and assessments; Estab lish a trauma-informed standard of care that meets the academic and social-emotional needs of students by default, not by exception; U se student and school-level data to intervene with support, not punitively; E nsure that our students see themselves in the stories of the adults who serve them, expanding pipelines for Black and Latine educators and for working parents; and In vest in the adults who serve students by ensuring a living and competitive wage and safe work conditions, without exception. Rooted in adequacy, equity, and anti-racist action, all school communities - including those serving BIPOC students, newcomers, diverse learners, LGBTQ+ students, & others long-harmed - will thrive. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: C ommunicate an informed vision of equity, and plan for its realization: Develop the vision collaboratively with stakeholders through surveys, standing advisory groups, and community meetings. Release a report on the current state of schools in comparison to the vision, with clear benchmarks for reaching new and existing equity goals, including hiring and developing more Black and Latine educators, expanding high-demand programs and supports in targeted schools (including under-enrolled schools), and meeting student and community needs for equitable and green facility investments. Mak e the expansion of the Sustainable Community Schools model a district priority, including the creation of a dedicated department within CPS. Consider how other priorities, including dual language, special education, and early childhood intersect with expansion. S upport newcomer students: Develop a comprehensive model that allows school communities to effectively serve newcomer students. Learn from schools already serving in this capacity, and expand resources where needed. B irth-to-Five: Review the current approach to birth-to-five public service and education, and work with CPS, sister agencies and CBOs to improve services and transitions.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 56 LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: E xpand equitable school practices: Maintain focus on equity goals established in the first year and continue to meet implementation benchmarks for supports for BIPOC students, newcomers, and diverse learners. C ontinue to expand Sustainable Community Schools: Engage in feedback gathering with new cohorts of SCS participants, and use best practices garnered through this process to effectively increase the number of participating schools to 200. MEASURING PROGRESS: NEAR-TERM: Equity p lan: Release of an initial vision and plan, and achievement of immediate goals around equitable distribution of programs and resources, student outcomes, staffing diversity, and facility equity. E xpansion of Sustainable Community Schools: 50 participating schools. N ewcomer students: Develop and implement a model for schools serving newcomer students, with a goal of doubling the number of schools meeting standards of the model. LONG-TERM: Equitab le practices: Meet intermediate goals around equitable distribution of programs and resources, student outcomes, staffing diversity, and facility equity. E xpansion of Sustainable Community Schools: 200 participating schools. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 57 BRIDGES LEFT TO BUILD: In a system of scarcity, people and providers with the same goals are often in positions where they must compete for their livelihoods. Resolution of these tensions is dependent on creating a city where cooperation is possible. In a system where adequacy and equity are present, bridges can be built: A cross identities: This includes bridges that ensure BIPOC students, newcomers, diverse learners, and LGBTQ+ students, see themselves in the curriculum, in the educators who serve them, on their sports teams, and in careers. I n our approach to repairing past harm: This includes addressing the harm done by school choice and closures in communities while ensuring individual students' needs are still met. I n our staffing model for schools: This includes reviewing and modifying staffing and budgeting models for school-adjacent services like food provision, janitorial services, and landscaping to better meet school and community needs. A cross provider groups: This includes bridges between community based and district providers of early childhood services and bridges between agencies serving young people in order to expand services from birth to five. Goal #2: A just city for our students, families, and their communities Chicago's new administration has the opportunity to partner with communities to transform its public schools system from one with historic, structural inequality to an equitable district that prioritizes the needs of communities most impacted by the affordable housing crisis and school privatization. Historically, Chicago Public Schools have remained separate and unequal - with affluent families in predominantly white communities having access to well-resourced schools with many Black and Brown students relegated to schools impacted by generational disinvestment, gentrification and consequent spikes in violence. Families from historically underserved and underfunded schools now have the possibility to experience the transformative, equitable educational opportunities they so deeply deserve. Access to robust, accessible, free public transportation and bussing for CPS is vital for public school students particularly students with disabilities. Communities that are impacted by Chicago's digital divide should have access to free stable Wi-Fi and free laptops for students. Schools can also be utilized as safe spaces for youth from Black and Brown neighborhoods to gather. There should be an expansion of restorative justice 6 and violence interrupters in areas with high levels of violence with increased access and connection to Chicago Park District activities for our city's youth. There is also an urgent need to develop affordable high quality housing and new programs with wraparound support for all 20,000 students and their families who are experiencing homelessness. Now more than ever, there should be increased coordination between governmental agencies (CPS, Department of Human Services, Department of Family & Support Services, Head Start, Illinois State Board of Education, Chicago Park District) with aligned internal systems. Including interagency data sharing and transparency would significantly improve access to services for youth and families. The goal of inclusion of those most impacted by the education system can be actualized through the creation of a permanent youth council that can share recommendations based on lived experiences in schools and communities. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 58 NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Audi t unspent ARPA funds and simplify access/process for local community organizations to apply for grants and receive budget updates. Devel op robust marketing plan around CPS programs that are currently available in collaboration with organizations serving students/families Devel op a permanent youth council to advise Mayor's on critical issues pertaining to youth and education issues CPS has the opportuni ty to create new Social Worker and Counselor positions in the form of crisis intervention specialists that are housed within schools that respond to individual and school wide crises. Crisis Intervention Specialists can be used to provide therapeutic resources and guidance around school-wide crisis planning. C reate a plan with youth and communities for how to expand violence interrupters - train community members that includes youth in the development of curriculum R eview CPS bussing processes to understand procurement process, bus driver pay, models in other districts, state law - make a goal like no child is commuting more than 30 minutes Audi t neighborhoods for Wi-Fi access for speed and accessibility including access to laptops to ensure that students are able to conduct their school work especially over Zoom Hir e a point person to sit within Deputy Mayor's office to coordinate interdepartmental processes and praxis.

This should entail a permanent youth council that informs policy and implementation; regular youth summits, listening sessions, and surveys; full year jobs and Career & Technical Education 7 apprenticeships for all applicants; and fully empowered Local School Councils (with trainings in partnership with community based organizations) and future elected school board with fully resourced training and support. The administration should develop a plan to restore powers to Local School Councils whose authority was restricted due to privatization policies and practices. Additionally, we recommend that the Mayor's office work with the ILGA to ensure that undocumented parents have the ability to serve on the new elected school board and that there are financial supports in place for working parents to serve on the board. There also should be increased coordination and information sharing between educators and service providers who support young people, increased transparency around Request For Proposals processes, and shared decision-making that is not centralized on a district level. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 60 NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: E ngage parent / guardian advisory board for the Elected School Board to include non-resident voice and change current policy to allow undocumented folks to sit on the school board. C reate a permanent youth council, a youth summit, and a youth survey. Estab lish paid support for youth council and provide compensation to youth council members and elected school board members Pr ovide training to youth council members to prepare them to voice their opinions/needs and not be tokenized and engage them in putting together youth summits, identifying work opportunities, and creating summer plans for students. Estab lish more stringent project labor agreements to ensure BIPOC and low income students and communities get priority to apprenticeships and city jobs. Pr ovide 100 paid Local School Council trainings, which can utilize curriculum and training materials from the LSCs for All coalition. Mak e the distribution of \"Home Language Surveys\" mandatory not only for CPS and Charter schools, but for anyone taking care of or teaching children 3-4 years old. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATION: S urvey and engage the public, families, community annually and report on the data. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 61 MEASURING PROGRESS: NEAR-TERM: F irst permanent youth council is established. A mechanism is cr eated for schools to be accountable to youth council and student voice committees that prevents repercussions from school administration. Incr eased infrastructure for the Office of Equity. LONG-TERM: Departmen t of youth created M ultiple youth summits completed coupled with parent/caregiver engagement BRIDGES LEFT TO BUILD: E very school has a Dean of Climate and Culture that understands restorative justice, school climate and culture. The liaison between Local Schoo l Councils and the district is independent. Schoo ls on probation still have Local School Councils with full power. Incr eased transparency around Friends Of (fundraising arm for LSC) and their fundraisers is needed. T raining should be done in collaboration between Community Based Organizations and Local School Council relations, with a manual redone from a community-based perspective. Goal #4: Progressive revenue to drive equity and fuel investment in young people Brainstorm ways to reallocate or secure funding to ensure that young people have equitable and safe educational and programming experiences throughout the city, and especially in neighborhoods that have been historically underserved and under-invested. There is no other way to address the epidemic of violence in the city and guarantee that the 20,000 young people who apply for, but are denied summer job opportunities, will now have available opportunities to do so year round. This will entail auditing and recalibrating Tax Increment Financing funding to invest in areas with the most need. The state will need to fully fund the Evidence Based Funding model, end Student Based Budgeting, find progressive revenue policy solutions, and clarify access to state and federal funding streams for job expansion. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 62 NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Do a deep dive in to the budget for inequities, which includes replacing student based budgeting with a model that aims to fully fund neighborhood schools and diminish contracts related to high stakes testing. E xplicitly identify how funding will continue once COVID/ARPA money runs out, considering options such as progressive revenue such as the cannabis tax, infrastructure dollars, federal funds for physically accessible schools, engaging major corporations and businesses, etc. Audi t and explore reallocation of Tax Increment Financing funds, partnering with community organizations and the broader public. I dentify and support progressive revenue streams that lower property tax burdens, fees and fines on working families while ensuring that the wealthy pay their fair share. CPS shoul d apply for electric buses with federal infrastructure grants to help with CTE programming and pulling services back into district positions to create environmentally sound practices and policies with student job pipelines infused. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: W ork with the state to determine ramped up paths to fully fund Evidence Based Practice and provide new funding to Community Schools. C oordinate federal, state, and county funding. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 63 MEASURING PROGRESS: NEAR-TERM: Announce a pr ocess goal of radical transparency where the books are open to being audited.

BRIDGES LEFT TO BUILD: R eview the expenditures of CPS Headquarters Devel op a funding agenda. S ustain the Chicago Early Learning Workforce Scholarships. $175M CPS pa ys in pension should be given back to the CPS. Goal #5: Robust college and career programming and pipeline We aspire to create clear pathways for students from underserved communities to pursue higher education and enter the workforce through strengthened ties and programming between CPS, community colleges and local universities. This would be the foundation of a system that supports current students and seeks to re-engage students who are outside of the system. School counselors should be equipped with the necessary tools to adequately support students pursuing a post-secondary education. We seek the growth and development of a pipeline for Black and Brown educators through the offering of full scholarships to local universities for any CPS graduate seeking a future as a teacher or principal. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Audi t, identify, and set goals for increasing Black and Brown teachers and administrators, and English Language Learner / bilingual education expertise. E xamine and grow models such as Grow Your Own teacher and educator pipeline programs. E ngage current parent mentors and the Parent Engagement Institute on how to expand over next 3 years Pr ovide instructor development support related to cultural responsiveness for teachers teaching Black and Latine students.

Impr ove pay parityCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 65 ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS F unding: Finding sustained, dedicated funding is a continuous challenge. Mindset shift: There is a zero sum mindset where groups are being pitted against each other as opponents that is unnecessary. We need to move away from zero sum politics and mindsets toward building a broader coalition. I magination: It is time to reimagine what education can look like. We need to move past crisis mode and to have the courage to imagine, planting seeds for long term solutions. I nfrastructure: We need to center and build infrastructure and capacity for equity, building the foundation with anti-racism as part of it. We need to discover what this looks like operationally and consistently, putting resources toward it and not centralizing responsibility solely in the Office of Equity. Equity & C ommunity: Throughout all of the goals lead with equity and community engagement, the community needs to be at the table, and power needs to be shifted so that stakeholders such as students or parents do not become tokenized. Assess: Assess what is currently being done, what is working and not working, and keep the things that are working and expand them - don't start from scratch and reinvent the wheel. T ransparency & Collaboration: A need for more transparency and coordination / collaboration came up again and again - things need to be publicly accessible and shared amongst all stakeholders. V alues: The administration needs to create a written, explicit value statement that publicly acknowledges that harm has been done and a commitment to listening moving forward in order to rebuild trust with communities that have historically been harmed and underserved / under resourced. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 66 Environmental JusticeCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 70 Environmental Justice CONTEXT & HISTORICAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT ARTICULATION OF THE PROBLEM AND HISTORICAL IMPACTS For too long, our city has both failed to address environmental injustice and continues to perpetuate environmental racism in its own decision making\u2014creating sacrifice zones in Black and Brown communities where industrial pollution persistently accumulates. This legacy can be traced back to decades of environmentally racist policies and segregation systematically concentrating polluting industries and hazardous facilities, mostly on the Southeast and Southwest Sides, and the broader South and West Sides, particularly through land use, planning, zoning, and permitting. 8 Polluting industries have influenced City decision making, preventing rigorous enforcement of existing laws they repeatedly violate to avoid operation disruptions while communities subsidize these industry profits with their lives. Colonialism, environmental racism, and segregation jointly harm the health and well-being of Black and Brown Chicagoans. This includes Indigenous Chicagoans whose long-term sustainable stewardship and land sovereignty have been violated. The intersectional burdens of environmental racism are complex and vast: from cumulative impacts of pollution, to industrial toxins, to the decades of austerity divesting our public institutions of schools, transportation, and housing, environmental injustice impacts every aspect of Chicagoans' lives. The Johnson administration is uniquely positioned to usher in the path to a Green New Deal that communities have fought for in the struggle for environmental and climate justice, protecting Chicagoans most affected by pollution and taking action on joint solutions for climate change and environmental racism. Solutions can, and must, intersect with overall efforts to dismantle institutional racism and create a more equitable Chicago. These changes must be implemented in every arena where decision making occurs, where resources are distributed, and where authority is held. NUMBERS & NARRATIVES: B lack Chicagoans are ~3x as likely to die from exposure to pollution\u2014a major contributor to heart disease, asthma and premature death\u2014 according to the City's 2020 Air Quality & Health Report. S ince 2016, at least 75 facilities on the Southeast Side have been inspected for violating the Clean Air Act. In 2020, one-third of all air toxic releases in the city of Chicago, more than 300,000 pounds, were released from eight facilities located on the Southeast side. 9 Li ttle Village has the second worst air quality in Illinois, and Chicagoans living near heavy-traffic corridors are exposed to the most polluted air across the city, particularly on the Southwest Side. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 71 Over the last decade, Chi cagoans have experienced on average an 80% increase in their water bills, with the largest debt burden held by majority Black, Latine/x, and Asian communities, and the lowest income households paying up to 19% of their income, over 6x the 3% international affordability standard. Rising energy burdens are already 3x higher among people in Chicago with low incomes, and 1.5x higher among Black households, compared to the city average. N early 150,000 water shutoff notices were issued between 2007 and April 2018, 40% of which were issued in five of the city's poorest zip codes on the South and West sides. Contextualizing the Data: Ongoing discrimination against low-income communities of color is built into current City laws, regulations, and practices, and these policies drive disparities in outcomes for communities. For example, the Industrial Corridor System Fund Ordinance designates areas, mainly in Black and Brown communities, as \"receiving zones\" for industry moving out of \"conversion\" areas on the North Side of the City\u2014including companies earning special incentives if they do move\u2014effectively paying industry to vacate more affluent white communities redeveloping and phasing out industrial land uses to set up facilities in and near lower-income Black and Brown neighborhoods, maintaining and expanding environmental harm. Information Needed: Despite some more aggregated quantitative and qualitative data, there is still a lack of thorough and transparent real-time monitoring at the fence line of industrial facilities to truly capture what is being released into communities. Decision-makers in the new administration will need to both increase access to such information and devise procedural justice that values the experiences of impacted residents who are best suited to co-govern with the administration to address the harms with robust solutions led by community ideation and expertise. This committee has compiled a list of recommendations that could assist the new administration in furthering its policy goals; they are as follows: CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 72 Goal #1: Ensure effective Environmental Justice oversight and responsiveness VISION STATEMENT Many Southeast, South, and Southwest Side communities in Chicago have fought to prevent or shut down polluters from harming residents due to extreme deficits in environmental policies and City action, some of which failed to protect communities, and others of which have been principal drivers of harm. This was recently exemplified by the previous administration's active facilitation of the relocation of a metal shredding facility from a white, affluent North Side neighborhood to a low-income, working-class Southeast Side community of color. Community organizing and federal findings of discrimination pushed the City to drop the permit for General Iron and enter into a Voluntary Compliance Agreement with many directives to address deep racial disparities produced by City laws and practices. With the City's permit denial recently overturned and a stated commitment to appeal the decision, the Johnson administration will move with accountability and put the health and well-being of communities first. To combat environmental racism, the concentration of polluters in Black and Brown neighborhoods, and the higher vulnerability of residents in these areas to environmental harm, the City will fundamentally re-envision how all neighborhoods in Chicago can be places where residents, natural resources, and business enterprises not only co-exist, but thrive in mutually beneficial ways. The City will have firm regulations to address cumulative impacts of pollution and an administration that is resourced to implement and fully enforce them. The City will embed the voice of communities in the decision-making process related to environmental decisions made by the administration to move an environmental justice and climate action agenda. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Deliver on commitments to the Executive Order on Environmental Justice, comply with the Voluntary Compliance Agreement, and complete the Chicago Environmental Governance Study. C ontinue Environmental Equity Working Group (EEWG) with impacted community representatives, environmental leaders, and partners. Create a community advisory body to provide strategic counsel on City environmental initiatives to replace or supplement the EEWG. EEW G leads, co-designs, and completes the baseline Cumulative Impact Assessment (CIA) paired with a transparent and community-centered, comprehensive study of current environmental enforcement and laws aimed at protecting communities from toxic pollution\u2014and CIAs should be used to inform decision making in all relevant policy areas. C ontinue Interagency Working group convened by Office of Climate and Environmental Equity (OCEE) and Department of Public Health (CDPH) where agencies should create EJ Action Plans committing to reform internal policies, programs, and practices to protect EJ Neighborhoods from intensive industrial and transportation use burdens.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 73 Pr otect EJ Neighborhoods, as described in the EJ Action Plans, by implementing plans once developed. Until a map designating EJ Neighborhoods is adopted, use currently available data such as the City's 2020 Air Quality and Health Index to identify priority communities. D PD develops updated zoning regulations, such as alteration or elimination of permitted-by-right or special use status for manufacturing, recycling, waste-related, and other intensive industrial land uses in Commercial, Manufacturing, and Planned Manufacturing zoning districts starting with EJ Neighborhoods. R estrict new or renewed permitting for pollution sources in EJ Neighborhoods. CDPH develops standard and special conditions to attach to air pollution control permits and certificates of operation, as well as a compliance history tool to inform permitting, and more, starting with EJ Neighborhoods. Leverage DO E to intervene in an appeal process for permitting to advocate for the community. Require robust impact assessments of any planned developments and potential new or expanded facilities by passing a strong cumulative impacts ordinance and complementary ordinances E nsure ordinances give EJ Neighborhoods crucial protection against business interests and ensure a just community review process for both new and renewal proposed operating permits.

Goal #2: Fully resource a new Department of Environment with a focus on environmental justice VISION: A Johnson administration will reinstate and robustly invest in a Department of Environment with a focus on environmental justice. The Department will be led by a highly qualified Commissioner and will be well resourced and staffed with the expertise to forward policy solutions that reduce pollution, increase equity and strengthen collaboration with community and other CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 75 City departments. The City will now use and expand upon the full existing municipal code authority to significantly increase environmental inspection, enforcement, and accountability by bridging collaboration across departments. A new DOE will co-govern with EJ communities, bringing community-driven decision making and transparency to zoning, permitting, and more. A new DOE should also be permanent and immune to budget deficits that often show up as budget cuts to important environmental programs. A new DOE will ensure Chicago's climate and environmental goals are met, implement and build upon and alongside the strategies and goals of the Office of the Environment and Environmental Equity (OCEE), pursue federal, state, and philanthropic funding to support these goals, and coordinate resources to meet the needs of Chicago communities, especially those that have been historically underserved. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: C omplete Chicago Environmental Governance Study currently underway; use its findings to determine the best way to organize the City's environmental functions, ensure robust staffing, implementation capacity; and present findings to all departments, offices, and agencies; alderpersons; and the public.

STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE: To achieve (1) economic inclusion and savings, (2) reduced pollution burden, (3) equitable access to critical infrastructure, and (4) community health and resiliency, we need collaboration and accountability of many of the departments in City Hall, and collaboration with the state and federal governments. Additionally, refer to Goal 1 stakeholders who are also relevant here. BRIDGES LEFT TO BUILD: While the group agreed that the Department of Environment should be created anew, there was not complete agreement about timeline\u2014concerns were raised that a DOE created hastily in 2023 would not ensure enough time for appropriate staffing, funding, and delineation of roles. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 77 Goal #3: Achieve a Green New Deal for Water VISION: Chicago will ensure access to clean, affordable drinking water for its residents, protect our abundant freshwater, and fortify our water system to be resilient to climate change. Mayor Johnson and the administration acknowledge that access to water is a human right. Chicago will adopt innovative ways to expedite the replacement of all lead service lines, focusing on replacement in Black and Brown communities facing highest risks from lead exposure and other pollutants, while finding sustainable funding sources to ensure the cost burden does not fall on Chicagoans who are least able to afford it. The administration will co-govern with EJ community leaders, with a joint decision-making table guiding lead service line replacement and prioritize access to training and job opportunities generated. Chicago's Department of Water Management must re-establish trust with Chicagoans through a renewed commitment to public service, equity, transparency, and authentic community engagement, and maintain sufficient staff and resources to expedite lead pipe replacement and carry it out in an equitable manner. The City will foster a climate resilient coast that maximizes public access to greenspace, buffers against flooding and protects from infrastructure damage, prioritizing green and natural infrastructure solutions. Inland, urban flooding challenges will be met when stormwater infrastructure upgrades are coordinated with other water infrastructure improvements, including lead service line replacement. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Greatly accelerate the pace of Lead Service Line Replacement (LSLR) Pri oritize communities facing cumulative lead exposure, homes with exposure to other environmental contaminants or prior water shutoffs, existing public health disparities, neighborhoods with high disinvestment in water infrastructure, and low- income households. Pri oritize child-centered buildings: childcare facilities, home-based childcare, and schools. R econvene and expand the LSLR Working Group with an emphasis on co-governance with community leaders and greater public input. Adopt a Righ t to Entry provision to help contractors expedite the replacement process.

STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE: Residents directly impacted by water injustices; environmental and public health advocates; housing rights and homeowner groups; Labor and contractors. Goal #4: Secure a just transition to an equitable decarbonized Chicago VISION: A decarbonized Chicago will build upon the current commitments of 100% clean energy by 2040, a fully decarbonized city transportation system by 2040, and a balanced transition of public, residential and commercial buildings to decarbonized solutions. With a focused strategy putting economic justice and just transition at the helm, the city and its underserved communities will benefit from this investment so these communities are not left behind. This can be achieved by decarbonizing Chicago's building and transportation sectors through reducing energy use, eliminating fossil fuels, and powering with clean, renewable energy. This must include comprehensive funding, public engagement, workforce training, and access to long-term, family-sustaining careers with an emphasis on community benefits, preserving public and affordable housing, and upholding social justice. A transition to a clean energy future will create employment opportunities for Chicagoans rooted in supporting workers' economic self-sufficiency, upward mobility, and overall continued welfare, with a focus on increasing access to jobs for historically disinvested people and communities who have been excluded from career track, family-sustaining employment. Frontline workers and community members will receive direct access, input, and jobs from planning to implementation. Programs such as community benefits agreements, access to (pre)apprenticeship programs, and local hire provisions for building and maintaining the buildings and surrounding infrastructure will be key aspects of ensuring this vision on the ground. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 80 To ensure a just transition, frontline communities and workers that have faced the disproportionate burden of industrial and environmental pollution around and inside their homes must receive the abundant co-defined benefits from clean energy and decarbonization. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Secure family-sustaining green jobs with worker protections and wealth-building opportunities for frontline workers and historically disinvested people. W ith the Deputy Mayor of Labor Relations, the Deputy Mayor of EJ, and DOE Commissioner convene a Just Transition Advisory Group with impacted trades, and climate and environmental justice stakeholders to create an equitable Just Transition Workforce Plan that creates family-sustaining green jobs with strong worker protections via targeted workforce development and contractor incubation for the following priority groups: Black and Brown workers, EJ Neighborhood residents, immigrants and asylum seekers, displaced workers including gas workers, youth, low-income workers earning below 80% of Area Median Income, women, LGBTQIA2S+ workers, and returning residents.

BRIDGES LEFT TO BUILD: An overwhelming majority agreed that moving away from fossil fuels in buildings is essential to climate action given 68% of Chicago's GHG emissions come from buildings, but not unanimous consensus on electrification. Goal #5: Guarantee utilities are provided in a fair, equitable, and affordable manner with an investment emphasis in communities facing the greatest utility burden today VISION All Chicagoans must have reliable, affordable access to electric, gas, and water service, where low-income communities and communities of color facing the highest utility burden today are provided with sustainable, long-term means to afford their utility bills. A Chicago that prioritizes utility justice means that no Chicagoan forgoes essential heating and cooling, or lacks connection to necessary services, in response to high utility rates and a structural inability to pay. The City will prioritize utility justice as a foundational piece of a larger strategy of community investment, poverty reduction, and housing displacement and foreclosure prevention, this will require intentional investment and structural changes in the face of increasing fossil fuel prices and a widespread heating affordability crisis, with a commitment to prevent ongoing cost-shifts of infrastructure upgrades to lower-income customers. A franchise agreement for the City that leverages shareholder funds will lay the foundation of investment needed to build community climate infrastructure and prepare our grid for increasing electrification. Mayor Johnson and the administration will improve and expand assistance and debt relief programs for homeowners and renters and develop sustainable funding long-term to address water rates. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 84 NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Address the rising cost of gas and electric bills, reduce impacts of fossil fuel emissions on indoor air quality, and reach climate goals by supporting electrification transition.

Estab lish utility protections and support for low-income Chicagoans, such as coordinating services for bill assistance, efficiency, electrification, and weatherization; increasing funds for assistance and efficiency programs; integrating health, housing, and energy services; and setting energy burden goals. E nsure a strong franchise agreement with provisions for more than $100 million in shareholder dollars for community-based climate infrastructure projects in environmental justice and R3 communities, customer financial assistance and arrearage relief, and a community energy and equity advisory council as one part of a multi-layered oversight strategy. C enter community input in the ComEd franchise agreement via creation of a Chicago Clean Energy Partnership that provides a framework to study, plan, implement, and report on clean energy progress in Chicago, advised by a Clean Energy Community Advisory Board. Address the rising cost of water and sewer bills by restructuring water rates, improving water savings for income qualified customers, and creating a water efficiency program Pr ohibit utility shutoffs, expand robust and non-onerous assistance programs, and ban the practice of placing liens on people's homes due to nonpayment of water bills. Addr ess historical impacts from shutoffs and punitive financial mechanisms by assessing and contacting impacted households, deploying debt relief programming and restoring water service. E xpand City's current Utility Billing Relief (UBR) program to include renters and multifamily housing up to 250% of the Federal Poverty Line, with funds for emergency plumbing assistance. C onduct a cost-of-service study and explore alternative affordable water rate structures for residents and businesses of Chicago to proactively address the water affordability burden, and cap customer bills at international water affordability standard of 3%. U se FY2024 billing system funding to bring billing internally to DWM so the Department can assist directly with inaccurate billing and implement restructuring to progressive rates. Incr ease funding into its Meter Save program to ensure all households have access to speedy, safe meter installation, which is proven to lower water bills. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 85 C reate a water efficiency program provided by DWM to further reduce water leakage from older fixtures and plumbing, improving the health and safety of residents while also delivering cost savings and new workforce opportunities. S upport expansion of efficiency programs and comprehensive system planning approaches for gas, electric, and water utilities Maximize administrative parti cipation in and advocacy for robust planning mechanisms that can best align utility deployment in Chicago with environmental justice and municipal climate goals. U tilize planning as a means to support expansion of efficiency programs to deliver energy/water and non-energy health, safety, and other benefits to Chicago households. S upport expansion of energy efficiency programs, comprehensive natural gas system planning\u2014including yearly cost-benefit analyses of electrification\u2014and other efforts to address rising utility bills. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: W ork with the Illinois Commerce Commission to establish a progressive residential electric and gas rate structure for utilities serving Chicago. Imp lement a reformed water rate structure that incorporates multiple customer classes; tiered, usage-based rates; income- based affordability programs; and other potential features for all water customers within the City of Chicago. Pursue a second p hase municipalization study to further explore how the City could municipalize its electric distribution service to support decarbonization and utility justice goals.

Goal #6: Achieve a Green New Deal for Schools VISION Under the Johnson administration, all Chicago Public Schools (CPS) students, educators, and staff will learn and work in buildings that emit zero emissions; where the air, walls, and water are now clean and healthy. CPS Buildings will be a hub connecting Chicagoans to jobs, health care, childcare, and shelter on extremely hot and cold days. We will install rooftop solar panels and school gardens to teach students what science and a healthy planet can do while teaching them the STEM skills necessary to prepare for the green jobs of the future. Climate justice, environmental justice, and racial justice curriculum rooted in anti-racist practice will be taught across subjects. Schools, particularly in communities with historic disinvestment and environmental pollution, have been neglected and fallen into disrepair. CPS is in desperate need of basic facilities repairs, health and safety upgrades, and energy efficiency retrofits. CPS has major programmatic, structural, health and safety issues that must be addressed: lead and asbestos abatement; ADA fully-accessible schools (not first-floor only); critical Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning upgrades and replacements; lead paint and pipes removal and replacement; PCB remediation; green spaces and gardens; heat pumps and solar power; electrical and internet/Wi-Fi capacity upgrades; washroom upgrades; adequate spaces for Career Technical Education (CTE) labs. A GND for Schools will make Chicago a leader in decarbonizing school buildings to make them healthier and safer, improving academic performance because we must do better for our students, our community, and our planet. By investing in the GND for Schools, we will maximize climate action impact, create family-sustaining green jobs\u2014especially for youth\u2014lower utility burdens for the district, and see numerous health benefits for Chicagoans. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: U se the educational facilities master plan (EFMP) to make the case for a massive investment into modernizing and decarbonizing our schools and revitalizing disinvested communities.

Little Village is hosting one of the largest shelters for 200+ asylum seekers, who are now also impacted by pollution. ADDITIONAL IDEAS/RECOMMENDATIONS FOOD JUSTICE: Food access and security link directly to environmental and racial justice. 37% of Black residents and 29% of Latine/x residents are food insecure, compared to 19% of residents overall. The City must pursue a just food system, mitigate climate impacts, and leverage growing as resilience. C ontinue the Chicago Food Equity Council, build its capacity, and secure it via ordinance. E xpand Community Growers Program to increase food justice in divested communities. Pr ovide water access funding for: immediate emergency drought mitigation, ongoing access by lowering fire hydrant permitting costs, and water harvesting and catchment via incentives. In ter-agency collaboration with Chicago Food Equity Council in support of local food systems as a key pathway to reaching City climate goals, including creating a staff position focused on food justice and food systems in DOE, DPD, CDPH, and OCEE. C reate a comprehensive farming infrastructure support program with CBOs.

R estructure the Mobile Prepared Food Vendor license with street vendors to ensure access and affordability for small vending operations and licensed traditional fresh street food preparation. C reate policies to improve conditions, pay, and benefits for food chain workers. Devel op and implement a strategy for growing and supporting farmer's markets across the City.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 89 WASTE: Chicago generates over 4 million tons/year of waste and ~9% is recycled, compared to over 75% in cities like Los Angeles. 22 million pounds of plastic ends up in the Great Lakes each year. City support for circular economic practices, including significant improvements in recycling, will benefit all. E xpand and codify a citywide curbside composting program and update City code to require recycling and composting reporting for high rise, commercial and institutional buildings. C reate a waste and recycling characterization aimed at increasing recycling and diversion rates. C ontract an independent evaluation of the Managed Competition system with recommendations for improvements, restructuring, or an alternative way of managing waste and recycling hauling. Pr ohibit City facilities from purchasing plastic and polystyrene service ware, plastic bags, and bottles and encourage conversion to reusable options that support a circular economy. OPEN SPACE AND BIODIVERSITY: Promote and preserve open spaces as a vital overarching strategy to drive multiple environmental goals. The presence of accessible, free, natural spaces within Chicago is directly connected to air quality, quality of life and the environment. We have seen a decrease in the number of open spaces\u2014parks, forest preserves, conservation areas, and recreation areas\u2014from Chicago's rapid urbanization of surrounding areas. Pri oritize funds for parks and vacant land in divested communities, ensuring equitable allocation to remedy prior divestment in majority Black and Brown communities, including providing year-round essentials such as readily accessible and supplied restrooms. C ollaborate with native organizations to identify and restore key land areas back to indigenous stewardship via a cultural conservation easement or other appropriate mechanism.

U pdate Chicago's Nature & Wildlife Plan to protect and conserve local wildlife. E xpand Bureau of Forestry funding, including tree planting and care for city trees. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 90 Health & Human ServicesCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 93 Health & Human Services CONTEXT & HISTORICAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT Creating the conditions to guarantee the health and well-being of its population is the central purpose of government. The environment and economic, physical, and human structures organized by people reflect the underlying principles and conditions that socially determine the health status of the people. The United States has never accepted the notion of health care as a fundamental human right, nor that all human rights (to food, housing, education, etc.) are intimately bound and cannot be separated. Based on a market-based ideology, the United States has deliberately undermined its public health infrastructure over the past 50 years. It is not a coincidence that deaths in the United States from SARS-CoV-2 (for USA overall 111/100,000) is much higher than for 20 peer Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. 10 This most recent pandemic exposes the fact that the United States does not have a functioning public health system. By Constitution, health care is a power reserved for the states and so we have at least 51 state health departments and a number of municipal departments with the power and authority to protect the health of the public. 11 Relative to other big-city health departments the Chicago Department of Public Health is understaffed and underfunded. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the dollars that the City's corporate budget allocated to CDPH comprised under 20% of the agency's budget; today, City funds constitute less than 10% of the total budget. This means approximately 90% of the budget is categorically determined and cannot be flexibly used or redirected to meet Chicagoans' needs because it is grant funding received from the federal government (CDC, HRSA, HUD etc.). Each of these grants also have an expiration date, which means that programs can only exist for as long as competitive grants are won to fund them, which sends a message that public health programming is optional and disposable rather than a central City government priority. Furthermore, over the past decade, funding for CDC had fallen by 2% after adjusting for inflation and further cuts to federal public health funding are now being made, putting CDPH's funding streams in jeopardy. Last, the disappearance of Covid-specific funding by the federal government, which enabled CDPH to remain afloat during the pandemic, now creates a crisis for the department. CDPH is facing a 69% decrease in its budget in the next two years due to the end of federal funding programs upon which it has relied to this point. The health and well-being of a people is determined by the decisions we make as a society. As Jaime Breilh argues, health should be \"understood as a complex, multidimensional process\" and not \"reduced to the narrow limits of disorders and perception of the degree of individual well-being.\" 12 We need to address the social determinants of health, which, according to the National Institute of Medicine, make up 80-90% of the modifiable factors determining human health, with medical interventions constituting only 10-20% of relevant factors shaping health. Policy together with public funding for direct service provision in communities are the two core tools for addressing the social determinants of health and thereby improving public health. Medical care should be understood as a supplement to--not substitute for--essential social care systems. Nancy Krieger's ecosocial theory gives us an important tool to use while thinking about our people's lack of health and how we can build collective health. As she writes, \"The collective challenge is for we who value health equity and human rights to contribute our part to the global project of ensuring the terms whereby all can thrive, alive in the sensuous possibilities of living engaged, generative, and loving lives on this planet, for generations to come.\" 13 The underperformance of our nation during the Covid-19 pandemic is not a surprise. Alongside defunded and widely privatized public health infrastructure, Americans not only do not have the best health care system in the world, we have one of the worst among peer wealthy nations, with dramatically inferior (and now declining) life expectancy and quality of life. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 94 Health is not simply \"good\" or \"bad.\" The critical (but not the only) categories around which power and oppression are structured (Class injustice, Racial/ethnic injustice, and Gender & Sexuality Injustice) are nuanced and together create the health and well-being of populations of people. Those people with more power and privilege generally have better health than those with less power and privilege. The health inequities exist in step wise fashion across populations. In a similar fashion, structural racism has never existed in America as simply Black or White. When we lump data together under Asian, Latinx, or \"Other,\" for example, we hid the most vulnerable and marginalized communities (e.g. Some Southeast Asian, Mexican, Central & South American Indigenous peoples, Native Americans, Native Hawaiians--all of which also feature significant internal variations based on income, gender, and geography). Health and wellness in fact are the result of social processes that are structured by systems and policies in the socio-economic and political context that produce hierarchies of opportunity based on one's social identity. The social determinants of health are determined by structural drivers of health inequities. This, in turn, determines the material circumstances, behaviors, and biological and psychosocial factors that are seen, more proximally, as impacting health. 14 Chicago, under a progressive administration devoted to protecting workers, students, and families that is assuming office in the wake of the clear failure of existing US public health models, has a unique opportunity to reimagine public health by creating a truly public, community-led model of public health for a nation in need of dramatic changes to its health systems. This mayoral transition is happening at the same time as several seminal events. First, Chicago is experiencing an influx of residents who identify as LGBTQ as they flee other municipalities who are legislating discrimination against trans-individuals and creating environments that are unwelcome to the LGBTQ community. Second, our population is aging in ways that will place a significant stain on our resources for older adults, with an 80% increase in the older adult population expected by 2050 in CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 95 Chicago.15 Third, the nature of work has changed, leaving large proportions of Chicagoans engaging in work that is precarious and unstable, with the goal of a stable job with benefits and stability now increasingly under threat.16 The demographic changes that have been ongoing in Chicago for over a quarter of a century have accelerated. Since 2010, the growth of the City's population has been slower than other large cities. In 1980, less than a quarter of Black Chicagoland residents resided in the suburbs. \"By 2020 the share residing in the suburbs had doubled to about half of the total Black metro area population... Chicago's Black population is one of the largest in the U.S. (second only to New York) and continues to be a major center of Black political leadership, culture, and community.... Between 2000 and 2010, the city of Chicago lost 25% of its Black residents. During this same period, the population of whites fell 5% while the Latinx population grew nearly 9%.\" 17 In considering the health and human services needs and opportunities in the city of Chicago at this point in history, of particular concern are the needs and opportunities of 'special populations.' While this term has been used to reference a variety of population characteristics since it emerged in the 1970s with respect to people who abused substances, the HHS transition team used it to focus on social groups who are made vulnerable by our current socio-political structure and therefore need 'special' consideration. This includes but is not limited to people who identify within the LGTBQIA+ populations, older adults, disabled Chicagoans, people racialized as Black and other racial/ethnic groups, people who only speak a language other than English, immigrant and refugee groups, formerly incarcerated people, and people experiencing poverty. These are groups of individuals who used to be referred to as 'at risk' or 'vulnerable' to harm or disease. We recognize that the needs and opportunities of these groups demand 'special' attention because of the way interlocking systems of oppression produce structural violence that marginalize their experiences. We examined these experiences as a group recognizing the margins as a place of power. A focus on marginalized 'special populations' also keeps us grounded on the public health principle of health equity, which reflects the fact that to most efficiently benefit the entire population, public health needs to focus on those who are subjected to greatest risk and disadvantage. This requires recognizing and rectifying historical injustices which impact health and assigning resources according to need. 18 It also requires us to adopt an intersectional lens which appreciates the experiences a person faces due to their dynamic and intersecting identities.19 What is needed is an approach to population health and human services that brings a truly health equity-guided approach to public health that is focused on addressing the social determinants of health that shape health for everyone. The public sector should exist as a system of care, but privatization, inefficiencies, lack of coordination, and bureaucracy are currently preventing our city government from achieving its full potential. When it comes to caring for our most vulnerable citizens, these issues are not only frustrating, but they are also actively causing harm. When human services are an afterthought, budget allocations are not equitable and societal issues are not fully addressed. The consequence of this refusal to invest in people upfront is that we then fail to prevent disease, disability, and violence and instead continue to irrationally rely on reactive and ineffective medical, policing, and incarceration systems. VISION: We envision a Chicago in which all of the health and human services needs of our constituents are anticipated and met throughout a person's life and in which each person is provided the specific support they need to grow, thrive, and live healthfully. We have found that the current system is inequitable, scattered, and\u2014despite the best efforts of the thousands involved\u2014insufficient to meet the City's needs now and into the future. This Vision will not be achieved through the flip of a switch, but through coordinated, short- and long-term actions to develop and maintain the system of Health and Human Services that Chicagoans deserve. With this understanding, we propose a vision of an equitable and robust public system of care for all Chicagoans that we must work towards. When we have achieved this vision, a person's race/ethnicity and class will not predict their destiny or health outcomes because the effects of structural racism and historical disinvestment will no longer persist. Every person will have the same, equitable opportunities to thrive. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 96 With all of this in mind, the Health and Human Services Committee has compiled a list of recommendations that could assist the new administration in furthering its policy goals; they are as follows: GOALS: Goal #1: Fight for policy and structural changes that transform the lives of Chicagoans. Develop a policy agenda grounded in compassion and solidarity to fight for people's right to health and wellbeing. RECOMMENDATIONS: F ight for changes in policy at the federal & state levels that guarantee access to health care as a basic human right. Advocate for universal access to health care, including parity for behavioral and dental health, that is high quality, safe, affordable, and culturally respectful personal and population health services. Ad vocate for access to fresh food, universal child care and early learning, and other basic needs to be met for every Chicagoan. Appr oach everything through an equity and anti-racist lens considering the needs of special health populations, including but not limited to older adults, people who identify as LGBTQ, undocumented residents, people whose primary language is not English, people with disabilities. Highligh t the role of the Chicago Board of Health as a leader in policy issues. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 97 S upport investment in IDPH state laboratories, particularly the one located in Chicago E xpand the number of hours of homemaker services available to Chicagoans through MOPD, especially since this enables undocumented people to get in home help. Goal #2: Realize the potential of the Department of Family and Support Services (DFSS) to be a leader for the human services sector. As a municipal body, DFSS has a unique power to convene community-based organizations (CBOs) around their shared work. Convenings could be useful for shared learning, conversation, and ensuring best practices across the sector. This power is not currently being actualized. DFSS also exists in a silo, a reality that is perhaps compounded by the office not being located in City Hall. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Devel oping a mission statement for DFSS. Without a mission, the default driving force becomes compliance, which only serves to bolster bureaucracy and stifle the creativity needed to make improvements. A mission statement could help improve efficiency and coordination. Impr ove communication among city departments. While many agencies offer integrated, wraparound services to meet whole people and whole families, city departments remain stubbornly siloed. CBOs have cited examples of having to tell one city department what was happening at another. Consider establishing formal linkages to improve communication, prevent duplication, and create opportunities for integration. Improved communications could also provide opportunity for convenings around topics that cross city department boundaries, such as childcare and early learning. F ocus on data collection and sharing. The city's unique vantage point in the human services ecosystem provides an incredible opportunity to collect data from across the sector. Prioritizing this could demonstrate valuable leadership for CBOs by helping them build from good data. Lead wi th equity. A city with such vastly uneven outcomes requires budget priorities that are equitable in response to existing need. The robust system of care we envision can only be achieved with equity underpinning every step. The Chicago Food Equity Council can be an important partner for this effort in advancing food justice. E nd poverty-wage jobs in human services. Commit to paying a living wage and investing in the wellbeing of all city workers and all workers providing city-contracted services.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 98 Goal #3: Optimize the city's role as funder by ensuring no money is left on the table. Even with the \"claw back\" of federal funds, there are grant opportunities from federal and state government that only the city is eligible for. Unfortunately, our city has often missed out completely on applying, and even when we do apply, our lack of coordination with other levels of government or private sector partners has produced weak applications. Further, even once a grant is received, it often takes entirely too long to get the resources out into community, especially for delegate or partner agencies. Burdensome restrictions to receive these funds have caused crippling slowdowns. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: E xamine processes with an eye towards ensuring accountability and maximized use of public funds as determined by the administration's goals. Consider how this might also work across city departments. C onsider a nonprofit partner to dispense funds. Many other cities use separate 501c3s, such as The Fund for Public Health in New York City, to dispense funds more easily to partners. Listen to comm unity and delegate agencies. To ensure any efforts made are moving in the right direction, the voice of grant recipients should be considered. Organizations who offer grants of their own may especially have useful insights. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 99 Goal #4: Develop, enhance, and invest in integrated approaches to addressing the whole person. People living in poverty rarely have just one need. This can frequently mean interacting with multiple city departments to address different challenges in their lives and the lives of their family members. When every department requires separate burdensome paperwork and processes to receive services, it can amount to an incredible amount of work to get help meeting basic needs, adding more stress to an already stressful circumstance. Leadership in the sector should mean understanding this reality and using it to reshape both any provision of services and the funding of delegate agencies. A robust system of public care should always have the myriad dimensions of people and families at the forefront. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Delineate w hat will be addressed through direct service and what will be executed through partnerships to ensure optimal functioning of a robust system of public care. More about this consideration is addressed in the \"Bridges to Build\" section. C onsider a community info exchange. While the city need not share private data across departments when not appropriate, sponsorship of a community info exchange could help mitigate the challenges of duplicating paperwork at different departments, making it easier for residents to seek and receive care. This could be built off the current 211 system created in partnership with the County and United Way. C onsider ways to align care and delivery of services across city departments and levels of government. The challenges of whole households require holistic solutions. Explore existing models of integration and consider how they could be bolstered, supported, and expanded. Consider partnership within other city departments, like Chicago Housing Authority, the library, and others, to optimize this work. Goal #5: Declare a human services state of emergency. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, we witnessed unprecedented cooperation among the sector. Everyone rose to the challenge of keeping our residents safe. The waning of the pandemic does not have to mean the end of this cooperation. Since COVID-19 exacerbated the challenges of our most vulnerable neighbors, we are currently in the midst of a crisis of people unable to meet their basic needs. In fact, the new wave of migrants have strained already fragile systems. Declaring this reality from the Mayor's office would draw vital attention and could pave the way for a new day in addressing these massive challenges. We need to learn from the pandemic response and apply the lessons to this current crisis. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 100 We acknowledge and support the Mayor's previous declarations and commitments around the crisis of domestic violence, and do not wish to minimize or negate that important step. We only ask that crises like food insecurity, homelessness, and other forms of extreme poverty be approached with the same gravity. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Mak e a public declaration of this crisis from the Mayor's office. No previous administration has been willing to bring this issue to the forefront. We implore Mayor Johnson to break this tradition. S tand up coordinated response systems. Like the COVID-19 war room, our human services crisis will require structures and systems to ensure communication and coordination. Focusing on our vision of a robust system of public care can help to orient these efforts in the right direction. Ensure this work is done equitably. As previously stated, our Chicago neighborhoods face vastly different challenges, but the areas with the most concentrated poverty and unmet basic needs deserve greater attention and investment. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 101 Goal #6: Build a Public Health Infrastructure that promotes and protects the health and well- being of Chicagoans and the communities in which they live. RECOMMENDATION: C reate a Chicago/Cook County Study Commission to examine the possibilities of building and maintaining a strong organizational infrastructure for public medical services and public health. There are man y areas where closer cooperation between the City of Chicago, the County of Cook may improve the health of the region. In order to fully consider a whole range of possibilities an Independent Commission should be established with in the first year of the administration and be given the staff and at least a two-year time period to prepare a report that considers a wide range of options for closer cooperation and possible transformation of governmental structures dedicated to the health of the people. This Commission should make recommendations about where clinical services should be organized and what is best carried out by governmental public health agencies. (e.g. Primary Care, Behavioral health, STI services, lab, vaccines etc.) Goal #7: Improve Surveillance & Data Infrastructure RECOMMENDATIONS: Deco lonize Data. The city should be specific in capturing data, and not lump large, diverse groups of people into generic categories like Asian, Hispanic, Indigenous, etc, which hides and creates misleading information about oppressed peoples. Data broken down across population groups (race, ethnicity (including sub-groups) gender, disability and geographic levels will give us a more complete picture of health and well-being. Expand beyond the \"traditional\" health data to include business, tax, law enforcement and other administrative data. I nvest in & expand Chicago Health Atlas: Merge this data with Cook County data and create opportunities for community members to understand and access this information. It must be easy to disaggregate data. Provide training for community residents, organizations, and schools to use an expanded Health Atlas. S ponsor a local conference with local health departments, NIPHC and academic institutions to explore how we can create a regional equity-centered public health data system. W ork with other local health departments and academic institutions to address the serious delays and issues with the Illinois Department of Public Health data infrastructure. B uilding on Healthy Chicago Equity Zones invest in a community-based participatory infrastructure across the city with communities leading research efforts to frame their own questions, produce their own data, and most importantly construct solutions. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 102 Goal #8: Ensure prevention as a core activity: CD PH should be a regional leader in championing preventive health measures. It should educate, coordinate and advocate for gender specific and culturally respectful clinical preventive measures. It should lead on population specific activities. (Violence prevention; Food borne illness prevention; avoidable deaths from oppression (e.g. worker hazards, unhoused, hungry, low wealth people.) Leverage other ci ty departments and institutions (e.g. Libraries, Parks, CBOs) to anchor population focused prevention resources and activities. Documen t the impact of investments (or disinvestments) in schools, parks, community services on the health of Chicagoans. (i.e. Health Impact Assessments; Anti-racist assessments) Goal #9: Advance Environmental Health RECOMMENDATIONS: A ccelerate the schedule for Replacing lead pipes i. Ther e is no \"safe\" level of lead exposure. Lead exposure from paint, dust, soil remain the most common sources of lead for lead burdened chil- dren. However, lead from contaminated drinking water can account for a significant amount of lead for individual children, and are a major source of lead on a population basis. Most Chicago homes (about 80%) are still supplied with drinking water through lead pipes. This makes Chicago one of the worst cities in the nation for lead levels in drinking water. ii. This will r equire a major (in the Billions) investment in our city's infrastructure. It is useful to remember that one of the earliest and most important public health investment in Chicago's physical infrastructure occurred 1892 - 1900 when the reversal of the Chicago River was completed to prevent repeated Cholera, Typhoid fever and other infectious disease outbreaks. iii. Lead pipe r eplacement plans should prioritize facilities that provide services to children such as home providers, centers, schools, parks, etc. since children are the population with the highest risk to suffer from the effects of lead poisoning. S trenghten Environmental Justice activities: i. R ecognizing the long history that Chicagoans have played for environmental justice, (from Jane Addams to Hazel Johnson) strengthen the public health workforce in this area. ii. Incr ease Environmental Justice staff within CDPH. Goal #10: Recognize the Health Workforce is the most important component of the Public Health Infrastructure Public health is everything and all city agencies need to intentionally address how their mission and day to day activities impact the health of our people. The Chicago region is rich with educational institutions of all types dedicated to producing well trained health workers. The city needs to promote programs which make these opportunities available to all regardless of class, race, immigration status etc. The City's agencies should be an important classroom for training new health workers and investment need to be made in present city worker's allowing them to keep up to date and expand their skills necessary for a healthy region.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 103 The 266 Corporate/City funded CDPH FTEs in 2023 represent a 60% decrease in corporate funded positions compared to 2000. The 85 CDBG-funded CDPH FTEs in 2023 represent a 56% decrease in positions compared to 2000. The 754 Grant-funded CDPH FTEs in 2023 includes 400 positions that are short-term positions linked to COVID funding. Even if the COVID funded positions are included, the 754 Grant funded positions represent a 26% decrease in grant funded positions compared to 2002. RECOMMENDATIONS: Pr opose a hiring plan to increase the number of CDPH staff on the corporate budget. Incr ease the cadre of Public Health Nurses in order to expand home visits to newborns, expand support of school nurses, have a nursing presence in all aspects of the CDPH's work. Incr ease and expand the number and role of Community Health Workers. Support the establishment of appropriate training and \"stackable\" credentials which afford CHW the respect, flexibility, and autonomy they deserve. MOVING THE POPULATION TOWARDS FLOURISHING Incr ease investment in Health educators of all types (especially CHWs) and expand community health education that is culturally respectful and linguistically specific.

This includes the daily systems of violence rooted in protecting dominant white, heteronormative, ableist and patriarchal power structures. Until failing to teach our children how to read, endangering workers on the job, failing to provide basic human rights (e.g. food, clothing, and shelter) failing to address structural racism are seen as the acts of violence they are; we will not make significant progress on decreasing individual level violence. Mobilization of all aspects of government and civic communities will be necessary to address violence in our community. The level of violence is an important and critical measure of health and well-being. Goal #12: Overhaul the mental health system MENTAL HEALTH ON A SPECTRUM Mental health occurs on a spectrum. Depending on the individual and social environmental conditions self-care, support from family & friends, community support, and sometimes medical support might be needed. The stigma of behavioral health needs and seeking help has been addressed. In the United States behavioral health (and oral health) is often treated as a luxury and available only to the wealthy. Chicago envisions a time where behavioral and oral health have parity with physical health care. In addition to re-investing in behavioral health services for those in crisis or unable to access treatment; we must invest in community services that help move the entire population curve to a healthier state. This means schools, faith institutions, parks and recreation services that help more people flourish and protect them from negative symptoms. Inequities in mental health service access stem from decades of disinvestment in Chicago's public mental health infrastructure. In the 1990s, Chicago had 19 city-run public mental health centers alongside an alcohol treatment center during a period in which CDPH was the largest provider of outpatient mental health services in the city. Between 2009 and 2012, Illinois slashed $113.7 million from its budget for mental health services, causing at least two state-operated inpatient facilities and six Chicago clinics to close. Today CDPH has only five mental health clinics remaining and provides an extremely limited range of services to a small number of the city's residents. Research has been able to measure the impact of the closures of CDPH mental health centers, showing that emergency mental health transports increased immediately following the closures in blocks surrounding the shuttered clinics. 20 Alongside this defunding of public mental health services, Chicago's Cook County Jail has become the biggest mental health care provider in the state and one of the largest in the country. It is estimated that large portion (30-50%) of the 6,000 people incarcerated in the jail on a typical day suffer from some form of mental illness. Many of these individuals have repeatedly cycled through the jail and the state prison system as an indirect consequence of the state's decision to reduce funding for hospitals and community case workers. Public systems have a unique and inherent accountability that is not guaranteed in the private sector. Although the private sector has stepped in, with the assistance of public funding, to try to fill the gaps in mental health care left by the closing of CDPH mental health centers, the scope of the problem is massive and there is still significant unmet need. In some cases, this has amounted to persistent lengthy waitlists and eligibility requirements limiting access to care for residents. Although the Trauma-Informed Centers of Care model from the previous administration sought to address this need, the funding from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) used to support it will soon expire, and no plans were left to enable continuation after 2026. Further, CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 105 when community does not have meaningful opportunity to voice what is or is not working for them, systems run the risk of adopting colonizer mindsets\u2014the belief that those with privilege and power know what is best for those who lack it. The legacy of the closure of the CDPH centers is evident a decade later, with data indicating that wards with high rates of behavioral health-related 911 calls tend to be concentrated in areas of the city where public mental health centers were closed. This is particularly evident on Chicago's South Side, where disinvestment led to a swath of public mental health center closures. This underlines the fact that defunding public mental health care undermines community safety and leads to the criminalization of mental illness, trauma, and poverty. RECOMMENDATIONS: CDPH should expand and improve direct service provision by personal focused behavioral health care. Reopening and fully staffing all 14 mental health centers in phases. Additionally, identifying a number of these centers that will also house 24/7 Mental Health Crisis and Stabilization Centers to support both continuous community care and acute crisis response. These 24/7 Centers should be placed in the areas that have received the highest number of behavioral-health-related 911 class over the last year. Setting up CDPH Mental Health Centers to provide substance use disorder treatment services with medication-assisted treatment and harm-reduction services. In addition to appropriate staffing by behavioral health professionals, community health workers should be hired to staff mental health centers, crisis response teams, and to engage individuals with high levels of unmet need via community-based services. Note: While the full committee is supportive of expanding access to care, there are differing views on the best strategy to achieve this implement goal. CDPH should implement better accountability and coordination systems for mental health clinics receiving public funding to improve scope and quality of service. Organizations receiving City funding to provide mental health services should provide publicly accessible, transparent reports on number of people served, types of services provided, cost of services provided, staffing, what proportion of cost was covered by City subsidies, number of people turned away and reason for denial of care, and a community needs assessment and how their organization is responding to stated community needs and priorities. Mental health should be safe, accessible, affordable, and convenient for every resident of Chicago. We need to identify additional locations such as libraries as a way of providing preventative care, create and utilize telehealth/ mobile centers, explore more field positions possible in collaboration with sister agencies (eg, Park District, CPS, CTA) CDPH should expand non-police crisis response and integrate it with sustained crisis-prevention services. Work to improve coordination with agencies across the City, County, and State.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 106 HousingCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 109 Housing CONTEXT & HISTORICAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT Historical policies around housing and neighborhoods have most harmed current and past Black, Latine, immigrant, low- income, and middle-income residents. Communities that were redlined have also faced a deep and long-term harm to residents' - particularly Black residents' - overall ability to build wealth, achieve economic success, and live healthy lives. Residents with a disability have been significantly burdened by lack of housing that is accessible to them, lack of quality options in affordable developments, and lack of location of appropriate housing and near transportation and employment. Families forced to double-up with others have also been excluded from people who are considered homeless and are therefore ineligible for most housing programs for unhoused residents or not counted as part of the impacted population. Equal access to rental assistance and rental subsidy programs for all, no matter their immigration status, has not been properly addressed by the City of Chicago. Residents returning from prisons/jails or with criminal records face significant barriers to finding stable housing and employment, and have been significantly harmed and limited in achieving the basic supports to live successful lives. Geographically, the South and West side residents of the city have been most impacted, facing underinvestment, gentrification and wholesale demolition of longstanding communities. Although attempts have been made to undo systemic racism in housing and homelessness services by the past administration like the Department of Housing's Racial Impact Assessment on the Qualified Allocation Plan; historically, these communities have not been meaningfully engaged or heard in the planning processes and decisions affecting them. City officials have not always sought community-designed solutions, instead only asking for responses to top-down decisions. The City should require Departments and Sister Agencies provide linguistically and culturally accessible information to residents, including for people with disabilities, rather than requiring language access for a few departments. A renewed approach would make a strong effort to provide easy to access opportunities for engagement that meet residents in their communities and tie outcomes to community-defined priorities. NUMBERS & NARRATIVES Unfortunately, though some progress has been made, housing is not yet fully treated as a human right in today's Chicago. Over the past twenty years, Chicago's Black population has declined by more than 260,000 due to years of disinvestment combined with rising housing costs, neighborhood challenges, and missing employment opportunities. Chicago's Latine population grew by 5%, increasing from 779,000 in 2010 to 820,000 in 2020, according to census data, but affordable housing options are not keeping up with the demand. Moreover, Black households are disproportionately represented in those who are experiencing homelessness; more than 70% of unsheltered Chicagoans sleeping rough are Black, and roughly one in four Black students experience homelessness while at CPS. Housing targeted to extremely low-income households is scarce. There are 25,000 people waiting for a Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) Housing Choice Voucher - on a list that has not been open since 2014 - and 180,000 people waiting for site-based public housing. POPULATION TRENDS FROM 2000 TO 2020CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 110 At the same time, in many community areas - predominantly on the South and West sides - nearly half of renters are severely cost burdened - meaning they spend more than 50% of their income on rent. These are the very same neighborhoods subject to decades of disinvestment that has resulted in significant population loss, as shown in the maps on the previous page. The Department of Housing (DOH) has made efforts to address affordable housing disparities such as passing the City's first-ever Equitable Transit-Oriented Development policy designed to drive investment near transit in disinvested communities and prevent displacement in neighborhoods, but more needs to be done and a focus on homeownership and wealth building cannot be overlooked. Additionally, it is imperative that DOH work together with the Department of Family of Support Services, Department of Public Health, and the Chicago Housing Authority to address the needs of residents in the lowest Area Median Income (AMI) levels and that find themselves unhoused. In too many parts of the city, new development is reducing the number of affordable housing units while pushing prices up - as shown on the image above, 2-4 flats are disappearing across the city. In some neighborhoods, they are being converted to large single-family homes for affluent owners, eliminating a large stock of naturally occurring affordable housing and closing a path towards asset-building used by working-class and immigrant families over the past century. In other neighborhoods, they are being lost to demolition, the foreseeable result of long-term systemic racism and disinvestment in Black and Brown neighborhoods. As Chicago seeks to build itself into an equitable city where each resident can thrive, we must keep present inequities in mind to ensure that we don't leave them for the next generation to fix. VISION If implemented, this set of priorities following this statement puts Chicago on a path towards being a thriving and equitable city where housing is a human right. In this Chicago, individuals of all income levels can choose to live in the neighborhood of their choice in close proximity to transit and the amenities they prioritize, without being unduly burdened by high rents or threatened by unsafe conditions. Such a city would be less segregated, would close disparities in health and well-being for residents of color, would provide greater stability both to families that own and those that rent, and would give communities real power through accessible and meaningful forms of public engagement to shape their own development. In this city, revitalized South and West sides have been built based on the goals and designs of the communities there today. All residents would have access to homeownership and a range of initiatives would expand access to quality, affordable housing for those with disabilities. This is a city that protects tenants from displacement and unsafe housing conditions across all 77 community areas so that tenants can build lives and thrive in housing of their choice. This Chicago would reorient decades of policy and move with urgency to provide affordable, accessible, permanent, and safe housing and supportive services to its unhoused residents. All City and Sister Agencies will have strong and open partnerships with the communities it serves, there will be no stigma around public housing, and voucher-holders will have safety and stability. This Chicago would overcome the devastation of the racial and ethnic wealth gap created by redlining and other structural racist policies and offer abundance for people of color, those with disabilities, aging adults, and low-income residents. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 111 GOALS Goal #1: Provide all those who are unhoused with services of their choice and safe, quality, accessible, affordable housing RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION: In Chicago, throughout the course of a year, more than 65,000 people experience homelessness. This number includes people living on the streets, in shelters, and staying temporarily with others or doubled-up. Chicago can and must do better. If we reach our goal of providing those who are unhoused with permanent housing with services, we will see: Saf e, quality, affordable, accessible, housing with services targeted to those who are unhoused is distributed equitably throughout the city taking into account historic disinvestment and neighborhood needs. Paths to access housing and quality of housing are the same in every community. Chi cago is a welcoming city that provides safe, accessible, and stable shelter, housing, and services to all who are here. R ecognizing that homelessness has been a significant, unaddressed crisis in the city for decades, Chicago moves with the same urgency and priority for resources to address homelessness among long-term residents as it has to address crises such as COVID-19 and homelessness for new arrivals. Mayor Johnson has set an ambitious agenda when it comes to addressing homelessness which includes creating local, dedicated funding for housing. Many of the solutions outlined in the policy section on homelessness involve the need for additional resources, so it is recommended that in the near-term the focus is on creating new funding resources. This committee has compiled a list of recommendations that could assist the new administration in furthering its policy goals. Recommendations that were top priorities are in bold and have more detailed implementation steps; they are as follows: NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: S upport policies that are in line with the Bring Chicago Home campaign to create a dedicated revenue stream through increasing the real estate transfer tax on properties valued over $1 million to create permanent housing and services for those who are unhoused. W ork through steps in state law necessary to revise transfer tax W ork to line up aldermanic support for proposal I ncrease public engagement and education to underscore how housing and homelessness impacts other challenges the city faces like public safety, education, health, and more All ow shelters by right and to ensure that aldermanic and community input are not barriers to building new low-income and affordable housing U nderstand current zoning process and where things get blocked CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 112 R esearch models from other cities and aldermanic processes for gaining community input Dr aft revisions to zoning code and community input processes C reate a position in the mayor's office to focus on homelessness including enacting a shared set of principles and goals, including Housing First, for all city departments and sister agencies, inter-governmental and inter-agency housing coordination, and collaboration with community providers and stakeholders. U se community outreach to launch a citywide assessment of public buildings and empty schools to discuss repurpose Pr ovide funding to increase salaries for services staff in supportive housing programs in order to allow housing providers to hire and maintain staff. Increasing staff capacity would allow supportive housing programs to fill 1,000 current vacancies. S top barring people from exiting the Blue Line CTA station at O'Hare overnight which prevents them from connecting to the 24/7 Haymarket drop-in center to get connected to housing and other services. N o one who is experiencing street homelessness should be asked to leave a location unless permanent housing is offered E xpand shelter beds and flexible emergency response during extreme weather including more low-barrier and non-congregate shelter and create a transparent database on availability of shelter beds. Provide funding to make shelters accessible.

Goal #2: Develop, enable, and support homes that are quality, affordable, safe, and healthy across Chicago NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Dedi cate more funding towards constructing affordable housing. T arget more funding towards subsidies to create housing at income levels of 30% AMI or lower.

Devel op more consistent mechanisms and tools for community involvement which enable communities to take an active role in planning for communities, neighborhoods, and the city as a whole rather than on a project-by-project basis, prioritizing communities of color. In parti cular, develop tools for aldermanic offices to create robust but time-sensitive community input processes to enable intentional conversations and help residents understand the tradeoffs posed by different stances towards development. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 116 LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Devel op additional financing tools for affordable housing. S pecifically, look to develop financing tools that don't require federal and state tax credits, which are administratively complicated and difficult for new developers to use. E xpand opportunities for housing development along transit lines. Specific changes only to be determined after process of gathering feedback from city residents in every community, but potentially including: N ot requiring zoning changes near transit for the creation of three-flats near transit. Legalizing three-flats by right near transit. Lowering or eliminating parking r equirements near transit. E nhancing existing density bonuses near transit and/or applying them to more zoning designations. E nhancing existing density bonuses near transit specifically for affordable housing. C ontinue to update accessibility standards for new construction and rehabilitation, including building on existing accessibility bonuses included in the Connected Communities Ordinance. E nable further density or height bonuses for accessible buildings. C onvene stakeholders to review balance needed to create more affordable housing via ARO Accel erating and building capacity to ensure that all new buildings are accessible, including homes GOALS TO MEASURE PROGRESS: Rather than r elying on inconsistent funding sources like in lieu-of fees for Chicago's Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund, create consistent, dedicated, local funding for affordable housing solutions. Incr ease current production of deed-restricted affordable units by 20-25% on an annual basis with an emphasis on strategies to create housing at 30% or below of AMI Incr ease current production of CHA units by 35% over four years R educe the time it takes a close on affordable housing utilizing City and CHA resources Incr ease the total amount of affordable housing funding beyond inflation rate (all sources - LIHTC, CDBG, etc.) METRICS FOR SUCCESS: R eduction in the time between financial allocations to projects and the spending of the same resources.

STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE: El ected officials, policy making and organizing coalitions, local community groups focused on housing justice, labor, grassroots organizing groups. C ommunity-engaged and equitable researchers Devel opment community - particularly re: intergovernmental coordination and permitting. BRIDGES LEFT TO BUILD Committee members agreed that the ARO does not serve all of the purposes that the city has given it. Many of the units built under the ARO are small studios or one-bedroom units rather than family-sized units, and many of them are not genuinely affordable to Chicagoans - 60% of regional AMI is higher than the median income in more than thirty of Chicago's community areas. Though there was no consensus regarding if or how the ARO should be modified, most agreed that there is a need for more deeply affordable and family-sized apartments that require additional city, state, and federal funding and/or policy changes. Goal #3: Preserve affordable and vibrant communities NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Pr eserve and add to the city's existing stock of affordable 2-4 flats E xpand budget allocation for existing programs Raise and expand decon version fees to more areas of the city. Build city infrastructure for Community Land Trusts, and ensure that the funds can be easily accessed directly by them.

While not strictly preservation, this strategy was brought up in submitted memos and creating affordability in new developments is an essential component of preventing gentrification. Goal #4: Protect Tenants' Rights NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: P ass policies like the Just Cause Eviction ordinance and enforce city and state bans on source of income discrimination S upport rent stabilization legislation at the state level F und fair housing testers to root out discriminatory practices around tenant source of income and criminal history R eplicate learnings from the Housing Stability Community Response Team (HSCRT), an effort to bridge city and community efforts to address the threat of eviction in communities hit hardest by the pandemic.

C ommit the City of Chicago to replacing all its lead service lines in 10 years, to be accomplished in a way that is affordable for low-income residents. Goal #6: Increase Opportunities for Homeownership and Wealth-Building NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: S upport land trusts and cooperative housing models across the city, prioritizing communities of color and communities undergoing gentrification. F ind ways for the private banking industry to invest more in Black and Brown communities by continuing to build out Lending Equity Ordinance to combat predatory lending practices. E xpand outreach, counseling, and resources for prospective homeowners DO H prioritizes resources toward homeownership such as their Tiny Homes pilot program, City Lots for Working Families Program or 2-4 flats initiative I ssue single-family mortgage revenue bonds (would be highly valuable in this economy) Offer incentives for homebu yers interested in communities of historical disinvestment E xpand the Accessory Dwelling Unit program to every ward in the city Mirr or the pre-apprenticeship requirements that we have on the state level.

R eports on loans rendered in any period of time by race, community area and ITIN status STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE: Low- income homeowners, advocates, banks, nonprofit lenders, community development financial institutions, existing co-op ownersCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 128 Human Rights, Equity & Inclusion CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 131 Human Rights Equity Inclusion Report CONTEXT AND HISTORICAL ACKNOWLEGDMENT In a diverse and often divided city, we must guarantee human rights for all residents, ensure equity in all facets of city life, and maximize the inclusion of all groups, especially those historically marginalized and left out, including Black, Brown, and Asian communities, our LGBTQ+ neighbors, youth, disabled Chicagoans, religious minorities, unhoused persons, incarcerated and formerly incarcerated individuals, poor and working-class residents, and immigrant and migrant communities. Every issue area has an opportunity to center equity because the problems related to inequity are intersectional and universal. As a subcommittee consisting of individuals who focus on a wide variety of equity-related work, we recognize that equity and inclusion must be examined from a structural lens considering all systems of oppression and exploitation. Moving an equitable agenda means addressing differential needs and opportunities; that discussion is broader than a single \"transition report.\" The major landmarks in this nation's history have race at the center: the arrival of European settlers and dispossession and destruction of racialized indigenous minorities, the institution of slavery that propelled the U.S. economy to greatness for some and to the detriment of others, the U.S. Constitution which celebrated liberty and made its peace with the denial of Black humanity in the 3/5 clause, and decades of racially biased immigration policies that facilitated the exploitation of Black, Brown and Asian labor. Even though all forms of oppression and injustice are not the same, it is useful to note that at various phases in U.S. history, policies and government-sanctioned programs vilified and racialized Jewish, Muslim, and some European workers who immigrated here. While Mayor Johnson did not have a special plank of his platform on racial justice, the theme ran throughout his platform and his speeches, vision, and values. It is almost impossible to have a holistic view any of the issues facing the city without applying a racial justice lens. If there is an issue of import, race likely runs through it. At the same time, there are few issues that are solely about race, and few issues that do not have a racial component. Those most historically impacted have been people with intersectional oppression and marginalization. This includes but is not limited to: people with disabilities who have 'invisible' and/or undiagnosed disabilities, and those who are also low-income, unemployed, people of color, unhoused, undocumented, and/or have limited education; non-English speaking communities, senior citizens, young people, formerly incarcerated people, LGBTQ+ people, with particular vulnerability experienced by trans people, people living with HIV, people who are also Black, Indigenous, or people of color, intersex, involved in sex work, have experienced violence or homelessness, are young, are older, are not safe to come out, and/or are low-income or unemployed. The list of possible intersecting identities is impossible to enumerate exhaustively. Some things have been working to support equity in LGBTQ+ and disabled communities. For example, the LGBTQ+ community has historically been engaged through an advisory council, task forces, a community liaison, contracts with CDPH, and public policy initiatives. MOPD sponsored the Home Mod program to provide home modifications for low-to-moderate homes for people with disabilities. But there is much more work to be done, and our report details some places where Chicago can grow into a more inclusive city for its LGBTQ+ and disabled neighbors. Our big vision, in terms of Human Rights, Equity and Inclusion (HREI), is for a Chicago where we can all live freely and have the resources, mobility, access, and affirmation to do so. It is paramount that the new mayor's administration deepens the conversation on human rights, equity, and inclusion and allows ample time to explore the depth of transformation needed in Chicago related to gender equity and racial equity. The mayor must work to create a unifying definition of equity that differentiates it from equality so that Chicago is known not only as a welcoming city but also as an equitable city. We strongly encourage the Johnson Administration to create a dedicated committee process for writing and refining a definition of equity aligned with Mayor Johnson's values and transformative vision. Several members of this subcommittee have offered to be of further service in future processes related to city-wide equity work. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 132 NUMBERS AND NARRATIVES We cannot have an honest conversation about justice in the United States, the City of Chicago, or the world without discussing race and racism. They correlate to life and health outcomes, zip codes, income, college access, career paths, vulnerability to street violence, police violence, and incarceration. Other subcommittee reports share significant numbers and narratives on this issue and we endorse the racial justice highlights in all the other ten subcommittee reports. Additionally, over 520,000 Chicagoland residents, approximately 10.1 percent of the total population, reported having a disability. Many people with disabilities lack access to receiving a medical diagnosis, which hinders their ability to qualify for a range of programs. Furthermore, disability can be highly stigmatized or not spoken of, resulting in a failure to meet a person's basic needs. People with disabilities use many public benefits programs that require varying proofs of disability and income limits and may have baked-in work disincentives. Regardless of race, age, income, or home ownership, households with a disability are less likely to be fully banked and more likely to use cash. Disabled people are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed. According to the Center for American Progress, \"disabled adults experience poverty at more than twice the rate of nondisabled adults; nearly half of the adults ages 25 to 61 who have lived in poverty for at least one year have a disability, while point-in-time counts suggest that nearly 25 percent of the more than 580,000 people experiencing homelessness on any given night in the United States have a disability.\" Students with disabilities face a wide array of inequitable circumstances, are less likely to graduate from high school, are even less likely to graduate college, and are more likely to enter the school-to-prison pipeline. For decades, the disability movement has demanded equality before the law, resulting in major gains such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. However, as we know, equality does not benefit marginalized communities the way it does white, non-disabled people. Disability equity needs to be at the forefront of community change to improve the lives of disabled people of color specifically. On June 17, 2021, the Chicago Department of Public Health declared racism a public health crisis. On June 6, the Human Rights Campaign, a national civil rights organization, declared a state of emergency for LGBTQ+ people for the first time in its 40-year history, citing the threats of violence and threats from horrific legislation meant to limit the rights of LGBTQ+ people and their very existence. These two declarations illustrate the stress and existential crisis undergirding the lives of LGBTQ+ people, especially for BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) and other historically marginalized groups that also hold the identities. Older LGBTQ+ adults have fewer financial resources and are more likely to be low-income than heterosexual older adults. Nearly one-third of LGBTQ+ older adults live at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, compared to a quarter of heterosexual people. Poverty rates are even higher for LGBTQ+ older adults of color, those aged 80 and older, bisexual older adults, and transgender older adults. It should be noted that the HIV epidemic is deeply connected to unstable housing and homelessness. AIDS Foundation Chicago has 1,000 people living with HIV on a waiting list for housing subsidies. Nationally, about 25% of people living with HIV have an unmet need for stable housing. People vulnerable to HIV or taking PrEP also need stable housing. In an intersectional approach, we recognize that none of us are statistics in stand-alone categories. We are multidimensional people. Therefore, racial and gender justice, disability rights, and rights of the LGBTQ+ communities are connected to all other forms of bias, discrimination, and oppression. Simultaneously we are all impacted by not one identity or form of injustice or privilege but multiple ones. So, understanding the intersections between all these issues has the potential to unite rather than divide us. They are all connected, and so are we. These issues are deeply implicated in all the other sub-committee topics, from housing to immigration to economic vitality and equity to public safety and police accountability. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 133 Goal #1: Establish Chicago as a Racially Just City VISION: Chicago's government will be transparent in its equity and inclusion agenda and accountable to racialized and marginalized communities. Racialized and marginalized communities, across their intersectional identities, find Chicago a safe haven with ample and accessible opportunities for their economic, health, and educational growth. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Estab lish an exploratory committee or task force on reparations for the descendants of Black formerly enslaved people who have resided in Chicago. This is a necessary part of truth telling and racial healing. This task force can learn from the challenges in Evanston and must ensure that Black immigrants are included in discussions O btain data on racial discrimination in jobs and education and support corrective programs and incentives that disrupt patterns of racial privilege and exclusion Adopt a cl ear, measurable definition of equity that reflects the reality of marginalized people in Chicago. The subcommittee strongly encourages the Johnson Administration to create a dedicated committee process for writing and refining a definition of equity aligned with the Mayor's values and transformative vision for Chicago. This process will encourage a fuller assessment and set of proposals to address the breadth of issues that fall under the rubric of 'equity' Infl uence community power and bring back community relationships by ensuring representation of BIPOC individuals, connected to BIPOC communities, in all areas of government decision making S upport ongoing and create new initiatives to build BIPOC community wealth through support of BIPOC businesses, BIPOC- led coops, and community wealth building Estab lish a task force to address Black and Brown solidarity that breaks down the silo and ends the narrative of multi-cultural division F ully fund the Office of Racial Equity so that it is equipped and empowered to do what it is designed to do Estab lish a working group to address a range of women's issues, including domestic violence, gender-based violence, and inter- family violence Estab lish an Office on Black Chicagoans to pinpoint those ways in which Black people in Chicago experience unique and acute forms of exclusion, violence, and discrimination. Black people are leaving Chicago in large numbers and are statistically worst off than most other Chicagoans by most quality-of-life indicators. We have other focused offices and task forces. This is another important focus area that resists treating all racial minority groups as a monolith with the same needs and challenges. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Issue an equi ty report that includes administrative summary data for each neighborhood across the different domains of equity, including qualitative data from neighborhood residents generated and focus groupsCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 134 The ci ty should consider the creation of a body with representatives from within and outside of government to track equity in an ongoing manner with real power (e.g. Chicago Plan Commission) that tracks every piece of legislation introduced (similar to the function of the Legislative Review Bureau in the Illinois State Capitol) and the impact of existing policies and practices on marginalized communities in Chicago; and the meetings, decisions, and data analyzed by/of this body should be open to public scrutiny. E mpower the Chief Equity office to impact all areas of city government and create a continuum across city government that allows for interdepartmental coordination and ensures an equitable voice at the table for housing, disabilities, etc. C omplete diversity, sensitivity, and cultural training for all government employees B uild on the strong culture of the city to collect data on the disability community and report on the findings and intersections that affect the community Pr ovide accommodations to address all faiths/work conflicts. For example, the city should consider prayer breaks for Muslim city employees C reate a task force on symbols and monuments for the city to assess whether existing symbols and monuments reflect the city's population and values, and whether new ones are needed to maximize inclusion and affirm the rights, history, and humanity of all. METRICS FOR SUCCESS Estab lish a change management strategy within year one C reate an equity tracking mechanism that regularly issues public reports across issue areas on all pertinent measures of equity STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE C ommunity-based organizations Offi ce of Racial Equity CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 135 BRIDGES LEFT TO BUILD: With our efforts focused on the issue of Human Rights, Equity, and Inclusion, agreeing on an expansive and grounded definition of equity was an early concern for every subcommittee member. There are several issues or problems related to the concept of equity. First is the way the public confuses the idea of equity and equality. Mayor Johnson needs to explain what he means by equity and amplify the benefits to all Chicagoans when we move toward an equitable city. Goal #2: Establish Chicago as a premier city for gender justice VISION: The Mayor has pledged to make structural changes necessary for all girls, women, transgender, gender nonconforming, and LGBTQ+ persons in Chicago to thrive. This includes freedom from the fear of violence and discrimination and full access to rights, resources, services, opportunities, and decision-making. All Chicagoans and people traveling to Chicago to seek abortion care are treated with compassion and receive care safely and efficiently. Chicago advances economic opportunities for women and girls. The Mayor's Office is committed to becoming a national model for gender equity and reproductive rights. Our city is a leader in ending gender-based violence and sexual assault. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: F ully fund the Office of Reproductive Health at CDPH to include: Public infor mation and education, including public awareness campaigns around Illinois and Chicago's laws and regulations that ensure access to an abortion. Promotion of insur ance enrollment, including Medicaid, which in Illinois covers both surgical and medication abortions. P olicy advocacy at the local level to strengthen laws that protect abortion, birth control and contraception, reproductive healthcare, and gender affirming healthcare. C ontinued support for the Justice for All Pledge, providing direct funding to abortion providers outside of CDPH and abortion support organizations such as Chicago Abortion Fund and Midwest Access Coalition that is consistent with the current and growing need. F ull staffing levels and professional development for staff across CDPH and other relevant city departments so that the professionals tasked with doing this work are trained in the latest developments in the reproductive healthcare space. S upport policies that would require CDPH to provide access to FDA-approved medicine for medication abortions, at no cost to patients, at health clinics operated by CDPH when the use of medication abortion is indicated and in accordance with the professional judgment of the patients' medical providers. C reate new public health clinics that have the resources they need to provide free and low cost community care W ork to enforce Chicago's \"bubble zone\" ordinance, which bars individuals from approaching within eight feet of a person within 50 feet of an abortion clinic if their purpose is to engage in counseling, education, leafleting, hand billing, or protest.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 136 LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: The Ma yor's Office should support policies that advance gender equity, such as the following initiatives: I mplement the 12-week paid family leave policy that is in place for the City of Chicago's workforce across all sister agencies. Address issues of pay dispar ity and economic discrimination, faced by women, trans, and gender-nonconforming people on the basis of their gender. E xplore policies that increase access to childcare E xpansion of the city's healthcare infrastructure to address the urgent public health issues faced by women, trans and gender nonconforming people including abortion and reproductive healthcare access, access to gender-affirming healthcare, access to mental healthcare, and gender-based violence and sexual assault. Promote the implementation of comprehensive sexual health education in the Chicago Public Schools aligned with the National Sexuality Education Standards, age-appropriate and medically accurate, LGBTQ+ inclusive, and in accordance with Illinois law. R equest or require the Chicago Public Schools to report on implementing sexual health education across every classroom and every school. E nd Gender-Based Violence and Sexual Assault Appoint a citywide commission on domestic violence and sexual assault. Establish a new missing P ersons Initiative with a special focus on combating violence against Black women. F ully fund an accessible and widely available violence hotline, ensuring it is shared on city websites and elsewhere in multiple languages. P artner with schools to develop consistent policies around dating violence in consultation with local advocates and domestic violence organizations. I ncentivize businesses to keep survivors employed and to support community efforts such as match savings programs to combat domestic violence. C reate a domestic violence survivor priority list for public housing. Developed a tr ained care professional unit to address domestic violence crisis calls. METRICS FOR SUCCESS: Estab lish a change management strategy within year one C reate a tracking mechanism that regularly issues public reports across issue areas on all pertinent measures of abortion care and gender-based violence. STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE: C ommunity organizations that service women and girls, especially those engaging trans and gender non-conforming peopleCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 137 Chi cago Department of Public Health Offi ce of Racial Equity and Inclusion F amily services organizations S urvivors of domestic violence E xperts in the field of gender-based violence Goal #3: Strengthen the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities VISION: People with disabilities across identities can use various public benefits programs regardless of varying proofs of disability, income limits, and lack of employment opportunities. Regardless of race, age, income, or home ownership, households with a person(s) with a disability have access to economic support and an affordable, accessible place to live. Disabled people are employed. Students with disabilities have the support systems needed in an inclusive and minimally restricted environment to be successful students graduating high school. All meetings, events, and future planning for the City of Chicago include communication and physical access. Homeownership and rental processes are easily accessible by people with all types of disabilities and people whose predominant communication style is not verbal and written English. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: The offi ce of MOPD (Mayor s Office for People with Disabilities) should be the convener to amplify, connect, coordinate, and accelerate the work related to disabilities being done across different offices that support the citizens of Chicago. H ire a Deputy Mayor for People with Disabilities who can coordinate and support Chicagoans with disabilities. G reater funding and capacity for the office to increase the public's access to their services. S treamline accommodation and other requests that people with disabilities need. M OPD should use a cross-disability framework, particularly supporting invisible disabilities (such as Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities and neurodivergence). C ollaborate with the appropriate stakeholders to bring more federal and state dollars to the city for the disability community. R ecommend establishing a mayor's office for mental health (under MOPD or adjacent to it). This office must involve and ideally be led by stakeholders CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 138 LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: M OPD should have an external outreach and education/ awareness presence in the community. S upport continuity of care and services for people aging out of certain offices and into others (such as young adults aging out of high school services). C omprehensive report of the current offices and services available to disabled people, including the weaknesses in current services (e.g., lack of phones being answered) M OPD should ensure that new housing units are built to comply with disability laws (i.e., built according to accessibility guidelines like the ADA, FHA, and Section 504 M OPD should locate and assess its affordable and accessible units and establish clear processes to connect people with disabilities to accessible units METRICS FOR SUCCESS: C reate a stakeholder committee of disabled people and service experts. This committee will oversee a comprehensive review of existing offices and services available to disabled people. C omplete an initial review of equity-related offices and services with a cross-disability and intersection framework. A more detailed review should be published each year, with weaknesses, suggestions for improvement, and timelines for improved services. Addr ess the existing backlogs in services provided for disabled people. C reate a Deputy Mayor for People with Disabilities who can coordinate and support Chicagoans with disabilities. Strategize amongst Deputy Mayor and MOPD for establishing MOPD as a convening office for issues and services related to disabled people. Create a quarterly work plan for the rest of Mayor Johnson's term for the rest of the recommendations related to this goal. Incr eased Chicago resident use of MOPD services by 15% each year of Johnson campaign. (This percentage can be modified in consultation with MOPD to make the goal realistic) STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE: P eople with lived experience of disability, including 'invisible' disabilities, with a focus on those with intersectional marginalization that are listed in the opening section (ex, BIPOC disabled people). \" Mad\" activists [this a reclaimed term] as the need for mental health services must also be addressed CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 139 N eurodivergence activists S urvivors of the medical-industrial complex Goal #4: Protect and Invest in our LGBTQ+ Community VISION: When the LGBTQ+ community is equitably protected and invested in, Chicago will be a safe space for all people throughout the city and a sanctuary for LGBTQ+ people fleeing discrimination and harm in other states. Whether to live in one's true identity or not would not require a risk assessment. All Chicagoans would enjoy culturally responsive, affirming, and affordable health care, including full sexual and gender-affirming health care; quality, affordable housing; and living wage employment without discrimination. People living with HIV would not be stigmatized and there would be zero new HIV transmissions by 2030. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: C entralize LGBTQ+-focused work in one place and be informed by the LGBTQ+ Advisory Council. E nsure the Chicago Department of Public Health prioritizes ending the HIV epidemic initiatives, including but not limited to increasing PrEP usage. C ollaborate with the appropriate stakeholders to bring more federal and state dollars to the city for LGBTQ+-related initiatives. S upport the proposed South Side LGBTQ+ center while working with existing organizations serving the community. Addr ess over-criminalization of queer people, particularly trans people, most experienced by trans women of color. F orm a permanent Public Safety sub-committee of the LGBTQ+ Advisory Council 100% of po lice resources will go to targeted violence against, trafficking, coercion, and assault of sex workers, with no resources will go to surveilling, arresting, or fining adults for engaging in consensual non-harmful sex work. Pr oduce an annual report on the diversity of senior staff, City Boards, and Commission appointments based on race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability status, and veteran status. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Put mor e LGBTQ+ culturally responsive & accessible clinics in every community. Learn about models of ser vice and community support in other cities. Devel op and create cultural monuments related to LGBTQ+ culture and history across the city. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 140 METRICS FOR SUCCESS: U nderstanding the impact of city policies and services on LGBTQ+ individuals and communities C ommitting fully to ending the HIV epidemic Decriminalizing LGBT Q+ identities E nsuring that LGBTQ+ people can fully participate in all that the city has to offer Incr eases in PrEP usage and HIV viral suppression rates (assign a percentage increase per year that is attainable and significant) Decr ease in the number of LGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness through increased housing support (assign a percentage increase per year that is attainable and significant) N o arrests or fines for consensual sex work Changes in po licing: No disparity in arrests between LGBTQ+ and cisgender heterosexual populations, decreasing interactions with police, ending police harassment and neglect, increasing police responsiveness; investigating and pursuing cold cases and hate crimes aggressively Incr ease the number of employment placements for transpeople Incr ease LGBTQ+ cultural centers across all neighborhoods STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE: C ommunity organizations serving diverse LGBTQ+ constituencies Goal #5: Increase Access and Affordability of Health Services and Housing for People with Disabilities VISION: People with disabilities in Chicago have their essential needs met by having dignified, affordable, accessible housing and healthcare options in every neighborhood regardless of income, race, sexual orientation, gender, immigration status, language spoken, or disability. We have eliminated housing insecurity, homelessness, and inaccessibility by building accessible, affordable housing, expanding home rehabilitation programs, and supporting pathways to homeownership for people with disabilities. Chicago prioritizes supporting a robust healthcare network that meets the community's needs by building public clinics that are physically, linguistically, and culturally accessible to all people. There are dedicated city department liaisons for programs and resources between community members and providers to ensure a holistic social safety net for all neighborhoods in need. ALL sidewalks, transportation hubs, clinics, and new housing developments are accessible to all people with all mobility needs. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 141 NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: T o best implement this goal, the administration should engage in a change management process through an equity lens with all department commissioners to ensure that they are briefed about the mayor's vision and are best equipped to carry it out. The Mayor must get buy-in from all facets of city departments and bureaus to carry out his vision of human rights, equity, and inclusion for all communities. The J ohnson Administration should build off of the work that the previous Chief Equity Officer began. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: The administrati on should explore modernizing and increasing the accessibility of the city's IT systems and Department of Human Resources and Procurement to ensure that we properly staff the city government. Ma yor Johnson should also bring in stakeholders and partners across the housing and medical fields, the Illinois Department of Public Health, County Department of Public Health, Chicago Housing Authority, Illinois Department of Human Services, etc., to coordinate an intergovernmental policy/program that increases access to care and housing. METRICS FOR SUCCESS: The administrati on should conduct a report on the state of accessibility to all currently existing public health clinics that also identifies necessary improvements/investments to existing clinics and identifies neighborhoods where accessible clinics are needed. M OPD should issue a report to the administration detailing all requests relating to home/apartment improvement requests, including budget estimates detailing program expansion costs. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 142 An in tergovernmental report should be conducted that identifies all currently existing programs, revenue sources, and services relating to housing and healthcare accessibility for people with disabilities. STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE: Disabili ty rights organizations N onprofit housing entities G rassroots organizing groups T enant rights organizations C ity agencies like CDPH and CHA (Chicago Housing Authority) ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS In follow-up and implementation, we encourage a more rigorous discussion of who is impacted and how by practices and policies of exclusions and discrimination. We also are mindful that all forms of exclusion and discrimination are not the same or carry the same weight or impact. We don't want to 'rank oppressions' or artificially conflate them. This type of over-simplification is dangerous and reductionist. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 143 YOUTH AND ELDERLY We want our city to be fully open to our young people whatever neighborhood they come from, or whatever music they listen to. We must address unhoused youth, system-impacted youth, and freedom of movement for youth. Youth must be active partners in shaping the culture and future of this city. They must be included in decision-making that will impact them. Similarly, we want all Chicagoans to be able to age and retire with grace and dignity. We honor our elders and want them to have maximum security, safety, and mobility. A special commission(s) to address needs of youth and elderly is in order. FAITH COMMUNITIES Faith communities, and secular values-based communities, are vital parts of our moral and cultural fabric. We want to affirm them and include them without imposing any belief system on any other person. Dietary restrictions, holidays, and worship practices should be respected and acknowledged in public spaces, at public institutions (like CPS) and at city events. Exclusion and Curtailment of Rights based on Class or Income is a large category of which we should be mindful. Requiring prohibitive fees for access or dress codes that make events inaccessible are all forms of exclusion for low-income, unemployed, and many working-class families. OTHER NOTES FROM OUR DISCUSSIONS INCLUDE: The emergency r esponse services often leave devices (wheelchairs) on the side of the road, neglected, and unaccounted for; this must be addressed Pr otect promises made by past administrations around migrant housing being built E nsure equitable access to water for all, barring privatization in Chicago Addr ess CPS (Chicago Public Schools) map inequitiesCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 144 ImmigrationCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 147 Immigration CONTEXT & HISTORICAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT The city of Chicago is located on land that is the home of indigenous communities that have been removed, excluded, and ignored. Chicago was founded by a Haitian migrant. As we advocate for support for migrant communities, it is important we continue to name the wrongs done to indigenous communities and Black Chicagoans. Historically, disabled, Black, and trans/queer undocumented people of color have been harmed by policies that create barriers due to their immigration status. We recognize that even among immigrants, Black immigrants are more likely to be arrested, detained and deported. City policies have historically limited access to housing, education, jobs, privacy, and safety based on race and immigration status. In 1985, former mayor, Harold Washington, through executive order declared Chicago a \"sanctuary city\". This prohibited city employees from enforcing federal immigration laws. The Welcoming City Ordinance was passed in 2006 and further changes championed by community activists in 2022 codified local policies to help ensure undocumented residents are not prosecuted solely due to their immigration status. However, we recognize that declaring Chicago a sanctuary city does not go far enough because undocumented individuals and asylum seekers continue to face barriers to accessing city services and are criminalized due to their immigration status. Directly impacted stakeholders aim to create safe and inclusive spaces that eliminate the questioning of an individual's status, expand language access, and ensure city programs and services are provided without regard to immigration status. We recognize that no human being is illegal, being undocumented is not a crime and seeking asylum is a human right. Undocumented individuals and allies continue to advocate for expanded protections that offer housing, education, language access, legal support, and community investments that help foster a safe and inclusive Chicago for all. In order to accomplish this, the Chicago government must create inclusive and equitable spaces that center those directly impacted to help inform policies that would affect them. Goal #1: Strengthen and invest in Chicago's infrastructure to be inclusive of migrant and refugee communities to make Chicago a true Welcoming City. VISION: Chicago leads the nation in ensuring that all immigrants regardless of race, color, language, gender, status, or disability feel safe, invested in, and cared for. Through deep collaboration, alignment, and relationship building across communities, the city, and other layers of government, Chicagoans are able to live in abundance by having all their needs met regardless of their language, race, color, gender, or immigration status. DE-SILOING IMMIGRATION FROM AN ISSUE ONLY FOR LATINE COMMUNITIES.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 148 NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATION: Appoint diverse stakeholders from African, Arab, Asian, and European communities on task forces and workgroups tasked with addressing immigrant and refugee communities. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATION: Ensure that all policies and practices have an equity lens, combat anti-Blackness, and are inclusive of migrants and refugees from around the world.

C reate youth and anti-violence programs that are inclusive of migrant youth. E nsure that residents of immigrant backgrounds are not excluded from life-saving city programs such as rental assistance, financial assistance, health, and social services. E nsure law enforcement does not cooperate with immigration authorities to harm communities and instead increase city resources that allow law enforcement agencies to timely respond to U- and T-Visa requests. Disman tle surveillance tools such as the Criminal Enterprise Information System (CEIS) aka \"Gang Database\". This puts heritage migrant and refugee communities at risk by criminalizing these communities, impacting their access to employment, housing, and education. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: In vest in innovative economic activities such as worker cooperatives, small business development, street vendors, shared kitchens, and opportunities for local artisans. E nsure that any new technology, surveillance, and policing infrastructure does not jeopardize immigrant communities. In vest in large-scale affordable housing efforts to ensure that immigrant communities can afford to live in Chicago. REVAMP AND RETOOL THE OFFICE OF NEW AMERICANS INTO AN OFFICE THAT CAN PROVIDE THOUGHT LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT TO CITY OFFICES AND AGENCIESCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 150 NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: E nsure the new office will coordinate efforts between the Mayor's office, City Council, and other city agencies to support migrant and immigrant families. R estore trust by communicating honestly and regularly to community-based organizations, mutual aid groups, and stakeholders. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Incr ease dedicated funding to immigrant inclusion programs, including the Immigrant Legal Protection Fund. Adequatel y staff the Office with culturally competent bilingual/multilingual staff to coordinate between governmental agencies and conduct outreach to make city programs, benefits, and services inclusive for migrants. METRICS FOR SUCCESS N ew migrants/asylum seekers can easily understand the infrastructure of support and gain access to that support in order to build their lives in Chicago.

C onduct regular surveys to identify schools newly receiving small numbers of ELL students that may need ELL support and access to a bilingual coordinator. C oordinate with CPS, community partners, and educators to identify schools receiving newly arriving families. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: E nact a new city funding formula that accounts for language needs and the needs of migrant and refugee students. R ecruit and train enough teachers and clinicians to provide the capacity to support migrant and immigrant children, including bilingual professionals. C reate a pipeline for multilingual educators, clinicians, and school support staff. PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: W ork with CPS to coordinate seamlessly with local community-based agencies and government at all levels to triage support, provide translation and housing placement, and connect students and families with all available services. E nsure parents receive multilingual information about their children's education so they can be fully engaged. E nsure that migrant and refugee parents and families have a voice in their children's education by appointing members to a Chicago Board of Education Non-Citizen Advisory Board. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: E ngage with appropriate elected officials to ensure equity and inclusion for parents and taxpayers in school board elections, regardless of citizen status. R evise volunteer policy that requires a background check and fingerprints to ensure it is not unfairly prohibiting immigrant parents from participating in their children's education. Provide a grievance process to address situations on a case-by-case basis. R eview employment policies to ensure E-Verify is not used as a tool to exclude undocumented immigrant parents from school employment. Ongoing Educati on for Older Immigrant Youth and Parents.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 154 METRICS FOR SUCCESS Incr eased access to dual language and ELL supports that meet demand.

STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE: Immigran t and refugee students/young people Immigran t and refugee CPS Parents T eachers C ounselors and Mental Health professionals C ommunity organizations that interact with CPS Disabili ty justice organizations U nions who represent staff in educational settings U nions with large immigrant and refugee membership who have children in public schools Scho lars that investigate the intersection of migration and education R eligious InstitutionsCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 155 ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS During our conversations, the Subcommittee illustrated the intersectional nature of immigration issues. The group surfaced numerous examples of intersectional issues around access to affordable housing for immigrant communities, labor issues impacting immigrant workers, educational support for immigrant youth as well as ongoing educational opportunities for their parents, services for immigrants with disabilities across the spectrum of government interactions, and challenges surrounding information about and access to government services. There were additional concerns around public safety, particularly policies, and practices related to T visa and U visa certifications, as well as data sharing with federal agencies through the presence of surveillance technologies in immigrant communities. Many of these issues require nuanced attention to the disparate impacts created by the breadth of immigration statuses held across the immigrant community- including permanent residents, undocumented individuals, refugees, asylum seekers, as well as other statuses in between. Furthermore, themes around race and class add to the differential ways in which policies impact immigrant communities across Chicago. This also points to the need for responsive and broad access to services in languages represented in the broad tapestry of Chicago's immigrant communities. Attention to immigration as an issue not solely affecting Latine communities is a critical component to devising policies and plans that account for impacts across identities and builds a foundation for collaboration to better ensure all immigrants across the city find safety and inclusion within Chicago. As immigration is itself an intersectional issue, so too are the recommendations for moving forward. The Subcommittee highlighted the importance of collaboration and coordination between the City and community groups to build upon what is working and deliver resources to where they will have the most impact. This will help to build relationships and grow trust between immigrant communities and the City, better-aligning efforts to support immigrant Chicagoans. The Subcommittee also recognized that immigration issues also call for cross-governmental collaboration involving the city, state, and federal government to address the root causes of issues impacting immigrant communities. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 156 Public SafetyCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 159 Public Safety CONTEXT & HISTORICAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT American history is characterized by its exceptional levels of violence. Founded by colonial occupation and massive loss of life and land for Indigenous people and sustained by a brutal and inhumane economy of enslaved people from Africa. Collective violence continued against Indigenous and African Americans, in addition to racist and oppressive policies that continued to keep them as second-class citizens. Chicago exercised these policies including Jim Crow, Redlining, and Urban Renewal. The results of such racist policies continue to have an impact and are directly responsible for disenfranchising Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) people, causing historical disinvestment in communities of color, and a century-long wealth gap that was designed to keep power and resources solely within the context of white America. While Chicago is 29.2% Black and 29.8% Hispanic, it also has one of the largest urban Indigenous communities in the country. Diverse Asian (including East Asian, Southeast Asian, South Asian, Central Asian) and MENA (Middle East and North African) residents are growing Chicago communities and represent some of the largest numbers of their residents in the nation. Infrastructure and resources will need to be strengthened to help Chicago continue to be a sanctuary city in all aspects, to those who already live here as well as to those seeking a new home. Tensions between communities must be addressed - Chicago has room for all of us. Acknowledging that the Government played a role and is directly responsible for the state of violence in our city is the first step. Addressing violence as a public health issue requires this administration to ensure all of its residents have equitable access to resources and public safety services. It is also true that public safety gains will only be achieved by giving most impacted communities a meaningful voice in the creation of public policies and investing in historically under-resourced communities. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 160 NUMBERS & NARRATIVES B lack Chicagoans are disproportionately impacted by violence. While they constitute 29.2% of the population, they represent 76.6% of the fatal and non-fatal shooting victims in Chicago in 2022.21 S imilarly, predominantly Black neighborhoods in Chicago present the largest safety gap in the city. The highest rate of fatal and non-fatal shooting victimizations occur in Chicago's predominantly Black neighborhoods (West Garfield Park had 98.1 shootings per 10K residents, East Garfield Park had 65.4 shootings per 10K residents in 2022). 22 H ospitalization rates for violence-related injuries were highest in communities with low social, educational, and economic opportunities. These rates were five times higher for Black youth compared to White youth [3] Longitudinal analysis of violent crime data in Chicago demonstrates persistent racial and spatial disparities I t is important to contextualize these statistics to acknowledge manifestations of racialized structural violence that have fueled and sustained these disparities over time. The public safety committee has compiled a list of recommendations that could assist the new administration in furthering its policy goals; they are as follows: Goal #1: Improve systems, staffing, and administration to reinforce public confidence in our public safety programs VISION: Rather than relying on the same failed approaches that have brought trauma to communities across the city, we must chart a new path to public safety that includes working with police and first responders to invest in the community-based interventions that de-escalate conflict, reduce violence, and make our neighborhoods safer. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: ESTABLISH A NEW MAYOR'S OFFICE OF COMMUNITY SAFETY: This office will partner with law enforcement, city agencies, and community organizations to coordinate anti-gun violence initiatives, amplify community-based violence interventions, and research new approaches to stop the cycle of violence. The Office of Community Safety should support efforts to ensure police accountability and rebuild police-community trust and support comprehensive justice system reform. The Deputy Mayor of Community Safety should centralize activities and programs with transparency and specific measures and metrics in the office. This involves defining clear outcomes, goals, and objectives of this office. It is recommended that the Office perform a community-level resident assessments/survey (city services) to define the problems of public safety and address the root causes of harm in each community neighborhood. The Office should implement strategies that reflect the root causes of harm (e.g., trauma-informed care, workforce development, youth violence prevention.). Finally, the Office should leverage community voice and past plans and be resourced with adequate staff, funding, and decision-making authority to equitably engage all 77 Chicago community areas. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 161 RECRUIT , TRAIN, AND PROMOTE 200 NEW DETECTIVES FROM EXISTING RANK AND FILE: In 2021, there were 800 homicides. The clearance rate by prosecution was 21.7% in predominantly Black neighborhoods, yet 45.6% in predominantly White neighborhoods. The study also found that since 2001, the rate of unsolved homicides for Black women is at 35% compared to 23% for White women. Both a lack of trust between communities and law enforcement and a lack of care given to Black communities from law enforcement when dealing with homicides are to blame. 23 Candidate backgrounds should be carefully considered. Candidates should be hired to reflect the demographic of the communities that make up Chicago. CONDUCT A WORKFORCE ALLOCATION ASSESSMENT OF CPD: Perform data-driven staffing analysis and workforce allocation assessment. Use the results to inform the City's negotiations with the police union to include measures to diversify the force. Evaluate the merit promotion process and eliminate barriers to hiring Black police officers. LAUNCH CTA/ RTA VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAM: Launch CTA/RTA Violence Intervention Program that partners with community-based organizations to connect and coordinate persons experiencing a crisis with proper treatment and care. Due to the homeless issue and lack of mental health clinics in Chicago, we have an increased number of our most vulnerable residents utilizing the CTA and RTA as shelter. These trauma survivors need housing, mental health, and support services, not police intervention. USE NON-CPD CIVILIAN POSITIONS TO ADDRESS NON-VIOLENT CALLS/CRISES: Create training and awareness for the community to respond by connecting to services and non-CPD resources, and coordination and interaction with other city agencies as a non-CPD response. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 162 LONG TERM RECOMMENDATION: INVEST IN A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO PUBLIC SAFETY THAT DOES NOT RELY ON THE POLICE: Having a non-CPD response team who can be quickly activated through calling 9-1-1 or 2-8-8. Coordinated team should be representative of crisis workers, social service workers, and mental health clinicians. METRICS & MILESTONES 1. M easure # new detectives per quarter (Target 50/quarter) 2. Pri oritize a workforce that reflects the communities in which they work Demogr aphic make-up of the city-funded workforce Demogr aphic make-up of the Fire and Police Departments (should reflect the demographics of the community where stationed) 3.

Select change agents for key public safety leadership roles, including CPD Superintendent. Intentionally develop the type of leaders we need to guide us forward: (1) Leadership development has been severely neglected in public safety professionals. Major investments in people are a prerequisite to successfully accomplishing those missions. (2) Reimagine the role of the police supervisor from that of a manager to a culture keeper. The Chicago Police Department must immediately reinstitute and scale the Executive Development Program for Sergeant. (3) The Mayor's Office must also commit to making investments in the development of leaders with lived experience. It has been a failure that people with lived experiences are not adequately represented in executive leadership positions that serve their own communities.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 163 Goal #2: Strengthen accountability through transparency and community collaboration The City of Chicago should acknowledge and repair the historical harms from traditional policing, reimagine what policing is and how policing is done to ensure the development of community led approaches to co-creating public safety, which will result in the needs of people in communities being met. EXPEDITE CONSENT DECREE COMPLIANCE NEAR AND LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 164 CREATING A CULTURE OF ACCOUNTABILITY: E nsure that the superintendent uses their discretion to suspend from duty with pay members of the department whose alleged actions demonstrate that they are a threat to the community or the department. E nsure that all CPD officers who fail to report misconduct committed by other CPD officers are investigated and disciplined as appropriate, and that CPD seeks removal of officers with sustained Rule 14 violations. E nsure that CPD Supervisors randomly review body cameras and other sources of video footage to evaluate officer community interactions. E nd the practice of using arrests, stops, tickets, citations, positive community interactions or investigatory stop reports to evaluate an officer's productivity. PRE-ARREST DIVERSION EXPANSION: During his campaign, Ma yor Brandon Johnson committed to exploring the expansion of pre-arrest diversion programs, investing in community mediation programs that will allow community members to address disputes without relying on police, and exploring the development of citation programs that allow officers to give tickets for minor offenses such as quality of life issues. Mayor Johnson committed to request that the federal court modify the consent decree to include these provisions. An overwhelming majority of Committee members agreed with the Mayor that the City should seek to modify the Consent Decree. Some members disagreed and believe that these diversion programs should be developed outside of the Consent Decree Process. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN POLICING STRATEGIES: E nsure that district policing plans are informed by community need and build on community strengths and are completed collaboratively with the District Councils and other stakeholders to reimagine the role of patrol officers. Develop incentives for officers who address community concerns without stops, arrests, or force. Support efforts to educate the public on the role of the CCPSA and District Council. Incorporate comm unity voice in policy development and develop and implement meaningful, transparent community engagement in all efforts to transform CPD. FIRST RESPONDER WELLNESS: Devel op, support, and streamline access to mental health care among all first responders, including police officers, firefighters, 911 dispatch workers, employees of OEMC, and community violence intervention workers W ithin CPD, ensure the full implementation of the Department's Officer Support System, which is designed to intervene in potentially risky officer behavior. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 165 WORKFORCE ALLOCATION: C onduct a workforce allocation study for CPD that: 1) addresses consent decree staffing requirements; 2) incorporates meaningful community voice; 3) identifies opportunities for alternative, civilian response that could relieve demands on CPD time/resources; 4) incorporates an analysis of 911 calls to evaluate demands on officer time; 5) develops a mathematical model for staffing determinations. The completed study (and any subsequent updates to the study) must be publicly released. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATION: FAIR HIRING: Mak e clear pathways for people who are part of the community to become firefighters, police officers, 911 dispatch workers, In addition, make sure hiring and promotion practices are transparent and equitable. CPD DATA TRANSPARENCY & SURVEILLANCE NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: DATA TRANSPARENCY: R obust transparency is critical to public accountability, trust, and monitoring of CPD and its oversight entities. Ensure CPD makes publicly available all data needed to inform the public and inform public safety accountability discussions. SURVEILLANCE TOOL REVIEW: C onduct a full inventory and assessment of surveillance tools and technologies used and shared by CPD, including 1) identifying the goals of the technology 2) measures and evidence of effectiveness, including increase in community safety 3) Transparency of use and evaluation of effectiveness 4) community input on use of existing and new technology, and 5) best practice and constitutional uses of the tools to limit any potential violations of civil liberties and civil rights. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS: ELIMINATE THE SHOTSPOTTER CONTRACT: In 2021, the Chi cago Inspector General (OIG) concluded Shotspotter had no demonstrative benefit in combating violent crime. Mayor Brandon Johnson committed to ending the ShotSpotter contract because of studies finding that it is unreliable and overly susceptible to human error. An overwhelming majority of the committee agreed and felt strongly that the Shotspotter contract should be phased out in year one. Others disagr eed with the Mayor and the OIG study and felt that prior to eliminating any one tool or facility utilized by CPD that another fulsome review occur. Technology, tools and infrastructure (including surveillance technology) should be reviewed to determine whether there are proper internal controls in place to sufficiently balance the right to privacy against the need to utilize technology to prevent and solve crime.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 166 ERASE THE GANG DATABASE: In 201 9 and 2021, the OIG reported that Chicago's gang database was inaccurate, filled with racial disparities and had no demonstrable public safety benefit. Informed by these studies, Mayor Brandon Johnson committed to end the gang database. The gang database is a source of racial profiling that leads to frequent, unproductive police interactions and harms residents' ability to find housing and jobs. In addition, the sharing of gang intelligence for non-law enforcement related purposes and sharing gang intelligence with other law enforcement entities for purposes unrelated to investigations should be prohibited. An overwhelming majority of Committee members agreed with Mayor Johnson's commitment. Others disagr eed with the Mayor and suggested that a more deliberate approach should be taken prior to making any decision on the gang database. Specifically, the process for placing an individual on the gang database needs to be reviewed and another determination needs to be made as to whether this process has any law enforcement utility. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 167 CLOSE HOMAN SQUARE: Ma yor Brandon Johnson pledged to close the Homan Square CPD site--the site of disappearances and other forms of abuse. An overwhelming majority of Committee members agreed with Mayor Johnson's commitment. Others disagr eed with the Mayor and suggested that thought a more deliberate approach should be taken prior to making any decision on Homan Square. METRICS & MILESTONES 1.

In vest in frontline non-policing services and infrastructure, buildings programs, systems, mental health clinics, access to affordable housing, outreach workers, jobs and employment; programs (parks, libraries), food access. Goal #3: Ensure safety and support for marginalized communities VISION: Public health and public safety are essential for all Chicagoans to feel protected and cared for as individuals and as a cohesive community. Acknowledging and dismantling racial and systemic inequities will ensure historically marginalized communities are safe and thriving. PROTECT MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES (E.G. STREET VENDORS IN LITTLE VILLAGE AND PILSEN, HIGH VIOLENT BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES ON SOUTH AND WEST SIDES) FROM VIOLENCE BY ENGAGING DIRECTLY WITH RESIDENTS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 168 NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Acknow ledge historical harm to Black and Hispanic Communities through ordinance or declaration. Pri oritize investing in public spaces in the communities and parks, make sure they are well lit and resourced with park staff to maintain a clean park, have equipment and programs happening in those spaces and make sure field houses are open for bathroom use or provide city-maintained porta potties and hand washing stations. Allow communities to develop vacant lots as such spaces. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATION: In vest in community-driven housing and business development on the South and West Sides. NEAR AND LONG TERM RECOMMENDATION: In vest in language access and other supports to fully engage and support marginalized communities, especially among Asian and MENA immigrants and refugees. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 169 EXPAND ACCESS TO TRAUMA RESPONSIVE, CULTURALLY RELEVANT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE WITHIN COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED WITH VIOLENCE NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Pr ovide resources for mental health and access to resources in Black and Brown communities. Call upon community-based stakeholders to offer trauma-informed programs for youth and families in their community. Expand investment in public mental health infrastructure and programs, including public mental health centers and crisis response systems. E ngage young people and parents of teenagers to expand summer jobs programs year-round and include conflict-resolution and violence prevention in schools. Expand access to services in school to meet the needs of neighborhoods (programs, youth work, anti-racist work, after school programs, etc.) Creating programs for ages 7-18 to have other opportunities that can keep them away from violence. WORK TO PREVENT VIOLENCE AGAINST LGBTQ PEOPLE IN CHICAGO NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATION Create a strategy for the Community to work with CPD to improve clearance rates of murdered transgender persons. Use data and analysis to understand the clearance rates for crimes against LGBTQ, reasons why closure rates for murders against Trans individuals are so low. Identify strategies to invest in preventative measures to create safety for the LGBTQ community, including equitable access to healthcare, housing, and employment METRICS & MILESTONES 1. M easure resources and funds across the city for prevention and intervention - where is the city lacking on available resources? Are resources accessible (e.g. not privatized)? How is money being used? 2. N umbers of jobs that exist for violence reduction and for teens 3. C reate a centralized online portal for resources available to Chicago residents with transparency about the accessibility of the resources.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 170 BRIDGES LEFT TO BUILD The committee disagreed on the use of Ring cameras to help police with closing crimes, with some believing the City should pay for community members to have Ring cameras on their property, and others concerned about the harms of surveillance technologies and the historical misuse of these technologies against Black and Brown communities. ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS Fully fund victim and domestic violence intervention services to reduce the prison population and increase restorative justice programs Goal #4: Expand support for victims and survivors All survivors of violence in Chicago will receive equal recognition and comprehensive support regardless of their identity, citizenship status, systems involvement, insurance coverage, and income status. Note: Transition committee members used both the term \"survivor\" and \"victim\" in their discussion of this section. Members note that individuals impacted by violence both directly and indirectly may prefer to be identified with one term over the other. Some members stated that \"survivor\" is a more strength-based framing of their experience, whereas \"victim\" may be received as less empowering term. However, the City's current funding and programmatic efforts to support individuals impacted by violence use the term \"victim,\" as does most state and federal legislation. To reflect the diversity of perspectives, both terms are used in this section. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 171 NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: C omprehensively map out victim service funding and programming across all city agencies in Chicago. Victim services are situated in different city departments, reach different populations, are based in different communities, and provide varying programmatic supports. Without an understanding of the current breadth of victim services it is not possible to coordinate additional investments in a way that reaches marginalized survivors and disrupts cycles of harm. I dentify barriers to accessing existing services among various survivor groups in Chicago. To understand where the gaps in services exist, it is necessary to access capacity and access issues among existing providers. These barriers may include cost, childcare, language access, stigma around receiving help, safety concerns, systems involvement, transportation issues, etc. C onvene victim services providers and coalitions to identify most pressing program and policy issues facing groups supporting and advocating on behalf of survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, community violence, human trafficking, hate crimes, police violence, and other manifestations of violence in Chicago. The goal would be to identify population and community-specific program and policy agendas as well as to identify cross-cutting themes across survivor groups Appoin t a citywide commission on domestic violence and sexual assault Estab lish a committee for the Black community made up of experts who can directly advise the mayor on harm caused and solutions for equity for the Black community in Chicago F ully fund the Office of Domestic Violence and ensure the DFSS Office on Domestic Violence has the resources it needs across the city. Prioritize and address gender-based violence, missing black women and girls, and domestic violence through adequate funding of DV programs and organizations that provide victim services. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: E xpand the survivor response network by training youth and peer specialists: Survivors of violence possess experiential wisdom as to how to establish safety and heal after experiencing violence. Similarly, youth can be trained as peer specialists to identify and support young people affected by violence in their communities. Activate sh uttered and neglected buildings in communities to create safe havens for survivors of violence: Survivors of violence need safe spaces for recreation, housing, and accessing services in their own communities. E xpand wraparound trauma recovery services through Chicago: The Trauma Recovery Center (TRC) model includes psychiatric care, case management, legal aid, peer support, and both individual and group-based therapeutic care. Incr ease emergency housing options for survivors of violence: Survivors of violence need flexible emergency housing options to provide safety and stability while navigating subsequent housing decisions. Assess f or trauma among first responders who support survivors of violence in Chicago: Community violence intervention workers, advocates, organizers, police, firefighters, social workers, and other first responders may experience violence both CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 172 directly and indirectly as part of their responses to violence in Chicago communities. This should be examined and attended to through assessing existing supports, identifying gaps in these services, and developing new interventions where needed. It is also necessary to develop programs and policies to protect victims of violence inflicted by a first responder, including but not limited to: intimate partners and children of police, firefighters, community violence intervention workers, emergency technicians, and other professionals. Devel op and launch a comprehensive public education campaign on the effects of violence exposure with information on how to access community-based services. Both structural barriers to accessing services as well as stigma have been identified as preventing survivors from seeking services. In vest in the police-community relationship by enlisting community leaders to carry-out agreed-upon projects for crime prevention and closures METRICS & MILESTONES 1. M ore efficient coordination of the City's existing resources to support survivors of violence in Chicago: C onduct an internal audit of victim services to identify needs, gaps, strengths, etc. Establish the infr astructure (meetings, regular contact points, coordination) for collaboration among victim services providers within the city Establish refer ral protocols between CPD, CFD, and other departments to connect survivors of violence into existing city- funded services Develop a comprehensive policy agenda for sur vivor of violence in Chicago C onvene an annual survivor's advocacy conference 2.

Disr uption of the cyclical aspect of violence (\"hurt people hurt people) A reduction of incidents of repeat victimization ( i.e. violent injury recidivism), a reduction in systems contact (arrest, incarceration rates, probation/ parole revocation) among survivors of violence and their intimate partners and family members. ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS Comprehensive support for survivors of violence in Chicago necessitates a collaboration with the Public Health Department, specifically around matters of behavioral health. Trauma responsive care is a core component of many of the recommendations in this section.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 173 Goal #5: Ensure safety of over-policed communities The city is ensuring that there are equitable investments in neighborhoods across Chicago, with a targeted deep investment in communities that have historically experienced the trauma of racialized over-policing. All Chicagoans feel safe in their communities and are deeply respected by the public servants that work in their neighborhoods, as we are building an ecosystem that ensures continuity between residents and a holistic approach to public safety that seeks to focus on the root causes of intra-communal harm and violence. STRATEGY: Develop a community engagement committee to ensure that community members are at the forefront of determining public safety strategies, investments, public policies and other initiatives directly impacting their communities. STRATEGY: Invest in communities as both a means of repair and harm-reduction. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Pr ovide 24-hour walk-in service in all 3 currently open mental health centers C reate community support teams to patrol neighborhoods to prevent mental health crises C reate targeted public-sector employment opportunities to under-resourced communities (i.e. \"Public Jobs for Public Good\") W ork with the business community, philanthropy, and other critical partners to coordinate a unified approach to job creation and economic development on the south and west sides of Chicago Incr eased education about city job opportunities LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: F ocus economic investment and job development in communities most impacted by violence Incr ease access to affordable housing, free and affordable healthcare, and free public programs F ully fund public schools and libraries R e-open public mental health clinics and expand access to trauma and mental healthcare E xpand employment opportunities for youth and adults In vestment in public infrastructure, parks, and outdoor community spaces C reate a process to ensure there is an equitable distribution of city jobs to each wardCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 174 STRATEGY: Reduce the over-reliance on and shift the role of police and give more power to impacted communities by investing in alternative response models that create a different approach to public safety. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Adequatel y train 911 call dispatchers to accurately assess whether the caller needs the fire department, police, EMS, or mental- health services F ully commit existing budgeted CVI resources and provide sustained public dollars to support evidence-based and community-driven violence reduction strategies focused on community violence intervention LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: In vest in trauma-informed, neighborhood commissions that promote peace and safety (i.e. the Peace Book) Dep loy a city-wide, non-police mobile crisis response units, prioritizing neighborhoods where there has been a high influx of mental health/behavioral calls to 911 (i.e. Treatment Not Trauma) E xpand CVI resources with a focus on hiring individuals from within the communities E xpand the alternative teams of the CARES program and eliminate the co-responder team Incr ease access to restorative justice programs and community-led peace circles STRATEGY: Robustly invest in, support, and expand community violence intervention practice in Chicago NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: F ill in the vacancy of Director of Violence Reduction in City Office C onvene all major CVI groups and coalitions to identify programmatic gaps and necessary supports to sustain and expand CVI programmingCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 175 STRATEGY: Ensure residents are empowered to speak to local police district council members about police misconduct and/or abuse and remove barriers to reporting police misconduct.

Rapid development of transportation infrastructure spurred growth in roadway, transit, aviation, and port sectors. Chicago's world-class transportation assets have fostered culture, promoted connectivity, and advanced economic development - not only within the city but also as an international transportation hub. At the same time, Chicagoans experience mobility differently depending on their race, ethnicity, age, gender, sexual orientation, ability, or socioeconomic status, and the benefits and burdens of transportation have not been equally distributed to all residents. In low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, there has been persistent disinvestment in transportation assets such as transit stations and protected pedestrian infrastructure, underinvestment in economic development, and overinvestment in polluting highways that erased and divided vibrant neighborhoods, dangerous streets, and freight facilities. Transportation associated with industry that was pushed toward disinvested areas created disproportionate environmental and health risks. Furthermore, insufficient infrastructure for people with disabilities has severely restricted their ability to move throughout the city. As a result, historically marginalized communities have faced inequitable access to transportation, which has limited their connections to education, employment, recreation, and essentials such as housing, healthcare, and groceries. Furthermore, transportation has been one of the main ways that law enforcement has interacted with residents. Historically, communities of color have been disproportionately targeted through traffic stops. They have also faced discrimination and scrutiny for simply being present in public spaces, such as waiting at transit stations and walking on sidewalks. Additionally, low-income communities have been disproportionately burdened by transportation-related fees and ticketing. Within the historical dynamic of prosperity and inequity in Chicago, a culture of activism has flourished and grown. Coalitions dedicated to advancing accessibility, racial justice, climate resilience, equitable transit-oriented development (ETOD), and more have achieved progress in making the transportation sector more beneficial for all Chicagoans. Today, this advocacy has led government officials to reprioritize their work through an equity lens. While historical disparities continue today, incremental CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 182 progress has been made institutionalizing priorities such as accessibility, climate resilience, ETOD, and community-led visioning in current government practices. Efforts aimed at remedying longstanding transportation inequities should be a priority for residents and government officials. Transportation faces new challenges today, however. The COVID-19 pandemic has strongly affected the transportation sector. Following a pandemic-related decrease in ridership, transit has faced sharp decreases in revenue, workforce shortages, and challenges with reliability, safety, and cleanliness. The pandemic has also caused people to develop new travel patterns that transportation agencies are working to understand and accommodate. The increasing impact of climate change has brought attention to the high emissions from transportation and forced a re-evaluation of how we get around and the need for government action. Due in part to the pandemic and longstanding challenges, the regional transit system is projected to face a budget shortfall of $730 million by 2026. Transportation officials must act today to ensure that transit does not face devastating cuts in the future. In addition to preventing a fiscal cliff, future work must include reforms to ensure that transit is sustainably funded in the long-term. As governments discuss solutions, residents want to see a future that prioritizes the following: Saf e multimodal transportation options in all communities In termodal comprehensive mobility planning throughout Chicago Equi ty and racial justice, in processes and in outcomes E mission reduction and climate resilience In tersectional collaboration with departments that affect transportation, such as planning, housing, and economic development. Therefore, the transportation committee has compiled a list of recommendations that could assist the new administration in furthering its policy goals; they are as follows: Goal #1: Stabilize service delivery and reliability of the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority). VISION: We envision a regional transit system that sets achievable expectations for service frequency driven by community needs, racial equity, and justice and consistently meets them. Trust in transit is restored and Chicagoans feel proud of their public transportation. CTA, Metra, and Pace trips are competitive with private cars and ride-hailing apps in terms of speed and convenience.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 183 SET UP SYSTEMS TO HOLD LEADERSHIP ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE STATE OF OUR MOBILITY NETWORK. CHICAGOANS HAVE HEARD THE SAME COMMITMENTS AND PROMISES REPEATED OVER SEVERAL ADMINISTRATIONS WITHOUT SUFFICIENT PROGRESS. ESTABLISHING ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS WILL BE CRITICAL TO STABILIZING THE CTA IN THE NEAR TERM AND FOR IMPLEMENTING THE BROADER VISION ARTICULATED IN THIS DOCUMENT . SPECIFIC ACTIONS WE RECOMMEND INCLUDE: NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Estab lish a deputy mayor of transportation position to coordinate across departments and agencies to ensure transportation investments advance policy goals and address intersectionality of transportation, housing, land use, community facilities, parks, and open space objectives. Estab lish a comprehensive report card for progress towards transportation goals, with scheduled updates and the development of key metrics to measure the overall health and direction of the network. Appoin t CTA leadership and RTA, Metra, and Pace board members committed to the administration's policy priorities. H elp CTA leadership be more transparent and accountable by establishing a regular cadence of reports by CTA leadership to City Council. E nsure CTA makes reliable, accurate service information available to the public. HELP TRANSIT AGENCIES NAVIGATE THE IMMEDIATE FISCAL CRISIS BY SECURING SUSTAINABLE FUNDING TO STAVE OFF LOOMING SHORTFALLS. NONE OF WHAT IS ENVISIONED FOR THE FUTURE OF CHICAGO'S TRANSIT SYSTEM IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT STRONGER AND MORE CONSISTENT FUNDING FOR PUBLIC TRANSIT AT THE LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL LEVELS. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATION: W ork with state and federal partners to close the RTA's projected $730 million operating budget gap and prevent fare increases and service cuts for CTA, Metra, and Pace. E nsure any new revenues will come with improvements to service, increased efficiency, and greater transparency. DEVELOP FRAMEWORKS FOR IMPROVED COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION AMONG TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES. ALL THE REGION'S TRANSIT AND TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES SHOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE RIDING TRANSIT THE MOST CONVENIENT AND AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION OPTION. IN YEAR ONE, THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD CONVENE REGIONAL STAKEHOLDERS AND DEVELOP A REGULAR CADENCE FOR COORDINATION ON PRIORITY AREAS, INCLUDING: CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 184 NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: C oordinate advocacy with regional partners to state and federal officials for increases in transit operating funding to prevent fare hikes and service cuts.

While many aspects of existing transportation systems sustain the lives of Chicagoans, not all residents experience the same level of access or connectivity. Our vision is a Chicago in which one's age, physical capacity, or ability to pay are no longer barriers to mobility. Our transportation system should promote inclusion, advancement and opportunity for all, growing Chicago's prosperity and world-class status. All neighborhoods should be safe, walkable, and connected. REDUCE COST BARRIERS TO TRANSIT . NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Advocate for state funding to implement free f ares for CPS students, seniors, and people with disabilities and expand reduced fares for people with lower incomes. C oordinate with other service providers to develop more affordable and integrated fare passes. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 187 ADDRESS BARRIERS TO TRANSPORTATION FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Establish coor dination with all levels of government to ensure integrated mobility planning centers people of different physical abilities.

NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATION: Through a combination of local, state, and feder al funding, including extending the Red Line south to 130th Street and CTA's All Stations Accessibility Plan (ASAP). EXPLORE STRATEGIES TO MAKE DIVVY AFFORDABLE AND INTEGRATED WITH OUR TRANSIT NETWORK. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATION: M ake it a more attractive choice for last-mile access. METRICS & MILESTONES P ercentage of household income spent on transit and overall transportation costs. P ercentage of accessible CTA stations Goal #3: Grow investments in equitable transportation. Investments in transportation infrastructure, programs and services must focus on populations that have been traditionally disadvantaged. New service and infrastructure must prioritize the south, southwest and west sides, reducing environmental, health and economic disparities.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 188 GROW CAPACITY FOR INTEGRATED, MULTIMODAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: I ncrease City planning and engineering staff capacity to facilitate implementation of projects that improve the speed and reliability of bus service and other multimodal transportation projects that prioritize moving people, not cars, especially on the south and west sides. Develop a fr amework for collaboration, like the Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency (CREATE) program, to develop and advance complex priority projects (Amtrak's Chicago Hub Improvement Program (CHIP), I-290/Blue Line corridor, BRT routes, etc.). Address congestion by pr ioritizing intelligent transportation systems (ITS), transportation demand management (TDM), and shifts to transit and active modes. E nsure the City's transportation workforce, at all levels, is representative of the communities it serves. S trengthen transit agency partnerships with City Colleges and high schools to build the transit workforce of the future. ADOPT A PARADIGM FOR TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND PROJECT SELECTION THAT WILL ENSURE THESE DECISIONS ARE MADE THROUGH A CLEAR AND INTENTIONAL EQUITY LENS. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Adopt methods for authentic, consistent, and effective engagement with residents and communities - particularly historically marginalized communities - making decisions not only in and for communities, but also with them. R equire that transportation agencies work with community-based organizations in the planning and implementation of improvements, compensating them when appropriate. Adopt a justice -oriented framework for project prioritization that incorporates and ensures equity-based criteria for transportation project prioritization and prioritizes projects designed to affirmatively remedy historical inequities. R equire the use of sustainable design guidelines and the use of renewable and sustainable materials in transportation and infrastructure projects. SUPPORT AND GROW EQUITABLE TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT (ETOD) AROUND TRANSIT HUBS AND CORRIDORS. CHICAGO MUST INVEST EQUITABLY NOT ONLY IN TRANSPORTATION, BUT ALSO AROUND IT. TRANSIT HUBS AND CORRIDORS SURROUNDED BY VACANT LAND AND PROPERTIES IN DISINVESTED AREAS MUST BE REDEVELOPED WITH QUALITY HOMES, SPACE FOR LOCAL BUSINESSES, HEALTH CLINICS, GROCERY STORES, AND COMMUNITY CENTERS. IN WEALTHIER AND GENTRIFYING TRANSIT-RICH AREAS, NEW DEVELOPMENT MUST AVOID DISPLACEMENT AND PROMOTE AFFORDABILITY FOR RENTERS, HOMEOWNERS, SMALL BUSINESSES, AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 189 NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: F ully implement and track the impact of the City's ETOD Policy Plan and the Connected Communities ordinance. G row the Mayor's Office's capacity to coordinate the departments of Planning and Development, Housing, and Transportation with CTA and other transit agencies, by sustaining the City's ETOD Working Group and creating a well- funded Office of ETOD. C ontinue prioritizing affordable housing near transit and identify opportunities to strengthen and create new links between transit and City-directed investments. E nsure the successful implementation and growth of the City's ETOD portfolio, including local businesses, community centers, grocery stores, health clinics, and spaces for art and culture, connected to transit. ENSURE LONG-TERM, SUSTAINABLE FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION. DECADES OF UNDERINVESTMENT HAVE CREATED A SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG OF PROJECTS TO REACH A STATE OF GOOD REPAIR. TRADITIONAL TRANSPORTATION REVENUE SOURCES CAN NO LONGER KEEP UP WITH INCREASING COSTS. WITHOUT ADDITIONAL, SUSTAINABLE REVENUES, THE CITY WILL BE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM IN ITS CURRENT STATE OF REPAIR, LET ALONE IMPLEMENT NEEDED MULTIMODAL ENHANCEMENTS OR EXPANSIONS. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Pursue new and enhanced funding sources at all levels of gover nment, including progressive municipal revenue sources, that modernize and improve our existing funding structure. New revenues must avoid undue burdens on lower income residents -- who may drive older, less efficient vehicles, depend on transit, or travel farther to work. S upport the flexible use of revenues generated from automobile user fees to ensure they can be used to fund multimodal transportation solutions to address mobility issues. C ontinue to work with regional partners and stakeholders to improve regional competitiveness through coordination around discretionary funding opportunities. ADDRESS THE ADVERSE HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATION: C enter environmental justice and climate resilience in transportation planning - prioritize communities most burdened and most in need of new investments. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Advance a comprehensive approach to full electr ification of CTA bus service to strengthen transit's place as the center of a sustainable transportation network, focusing on communities suffering from the worst air quality and diesel pollution. With more than 1 million transit trips per day, transit vehicles currently make up less than two percent of transportation emissions in the region. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 190 A ccelerate the electrification of the freight transportation system. Develop a comprehensive freight plan that improves the movement of goods, addresses freight-efficient land use, grows the economy, and eliminates disproportionate burdens on vulnerable communities.

Our vision is transportation networks that promote and support greater connectivity by active and sustainable options such as walking, public transit, biking and other methods that do not require car ownership. To achieve this, our system must be made safe for all people, especially those more likely to die or be critically injured by cars. MAKE SAFE, UNIVERSALLY ACCESSIBLE, MULTIMODAL STREET DESIGN THE DEFAULT . NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: I mplement the Complete Streets Ordinance and expand it to include all streets. Adopt N ational Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) design guidelines and apply them to all city projects. C ontinue to collaborate with state partners to bring safety features under City control. C reate and fund a crash rapid response team that makes immediate changes to intersections where fatal crashes occurred. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATION: I mprove multimodal connections between neighborhoods, such as walking and biking trails along the river corridor, especially in neighborhoods that lack greenspace. CALM VEHICULAR TRAFFIC.NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Socialize tr affic calming measures through demonstration projects and by enabling temporary, tactical interventions. I mprove safety on residential streets by creating car-free zones in residential streets to promote safe walkability and recreation for children. Lower the def ault citywide speed limit to 20 mph generally and 10 mph on residential streets. I mprove pedestrian and cyclist safety by restricting right turns on red. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Limit commercial tr affic on residential streets. C reate a citywide curb management program that addresses needs for deliveries, drop-offs, and accessibility. MAKE TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE EQUITABLE. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 192 NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Address and stop inequitable policing, tr affic stops and ticketing of Black and Brown Chicagoans.

ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS The transportation subcommittee is proud to have achieved unanimous consensus on almost all the recommendations included in this report. While a shift from our car-centric system is necessary, we acknowledge that a lot of Chicagoans still rely on cars. There is a tension between taking a slower, softer approach to encouraging mode shifts vs. taking a more direct, even punitive approach that may harm more people in the short run. To achieve the mayor's goals and maintain trust with constituencies, it will be important to provide bold, visionary leadership while not creating false expectations for what can be achieved. It will also be important to remember that improvements to the transportation system must consider intersectionality with other issue areas including, but not limited to those listed below. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 193 Education and workforce development: To access the public education system, students must get to school safely and on time, and be ready to learn. As such, transportation is vitally important to school systems, with implications for equity, student success, and well-being. To achieve the capacity necessary to achieve the mayor's transportation goals, it will also be critical that the City ensures workers are equipped to participate successfully in the transportation construction and operations workforce and that education partners and the public workforce system understand employers' talent needs. Economic development: Transportation investments that improve access and connectivity, both within the city and inter- regionally, will improve mobility and, in turn, will improve the City's economic well-being. O'Hare and Midway airports are critical economic engines for the Chicago region, and the transition committee supports the need to retain O'Hare's position as a leading transportation hub and international gateway. The airport is essential to retaining and recruiting major employers and generates billions in economic activity and thousands of jobs in and around the airport. Regional rail is also critically important to the City's economic success. Amtrak's CHIP aims to transform high-speed regional and intercity passenger rail service, connect job centers, reduce our carbon footprint and more. Housing: Housing and transportation costs are the two largest expenditures for most households. Combined housing and transportation costs strongly reflect aspects of the built environment such as density, land use mix, and overall accessibility, which influence public health through physical activity and access to basic amenities. The burden of high housing and transportation costs affects people's ability to accumulate savings and create wealth and keeps low- and moderate-income workers from finding housing well connected to their jobs, further exacerbating the negative impacts of high housing and transportation costs. Safety and public health: Transportation decisions play a vital role in determining public safety and health outcomes. The City's transportation system is necessary for people to get to work or school, to get medical attention, to access healthy foods at a grocery store and to participate in countless other activities every day. However, too many Chicagoans are negatively impacted by transportation decisions that are detrimental to public safety and health. This can be measured by roadway fatalities and injuries, compounding pollution impacts, opportunities for physical activity, among others. Climate and environmental justice: The transportation system provides numerous benefits to the traveling public, particularly sustainable and active modes like walking, biking, and transit. However, vehicle infrastructure and emissions generate significant environmental burdens which often have a more detrimental and compounding effect on vulnerable populations and can disproportionately impact communities of color and low-income communities. It is crucial that we make our transportation system more able to withstand the shocks that a changing climate will bring and make investments that work toward eliminating disparities.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 194 Workers' Rights & LaborCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 197 Workers' Rights and Labor CONTEXT & HISTORICAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT The Workers' Rights and Labor Subcommittee has embarked on the crucial task of addressing the long-standing challenges faced by workers in Chicago. To understand the depth of the problem, it is important to recognize the historical impacts and systemic inequities that have perpetuated these issues. Chicago's history is marked by a legacy of labor struggles, fights for economic opportunity, and movements that have sought to improve working conditions, wages, access to work, and the rights of workers. However, despite progress made over the years, workers in Chicago continue to face significant barriers, including inadequate wages, wage theft, limited job security, discriminatory practices, insufficient access to benefits, and lack of workforce development opportunities. These challenges disproportionately affect marginalized communities, perpetuating socioeconomic inequalities and hindering upward mobility. Historical and systemic factors have contributed to the perpetuation of these disparities, such as racial discrimination, exploitative labor practices, and limited representation of workers' interests in policy making. Historical tensions between some labor groups and environmental movements have fractured our common agenda to realize a just transition. The historical engagement of impacted groups by the Chicago government has been inconsistent and insufficient, failing to adequately address their specific needs and concerns. Recognizing this historical context is crucial in understanding the urgency and necessity of comprehensive reforms to protect workers' rights and promote labor equity in Chicago. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 198 VISION: The Workers' Rights and Labor Subcommittee envisions a Chicago where workers' rights are safeguarded, labor standards are upheld, and every individual has equal access to fair and dignified employment opportunities. This vision necessitates the cultivation of inclusive workplaces, the promotion of economic justice, and the dismantling of systemic barriers that perpetuate inequality. Goal #1: Create a Comprehensive and Accessible Workforce Development Ecosystem Our shared aspiration is a Chicago where individuals, irrespective of their immigration status or background with the criminal legal system, gender identity, ability, or race, can access high-quality employment, training, protection, and support for success. We aim to build a city where all residents can access information about workers' rights, protections, and opportunities in a centralized and accessible manner. The public sector will play a vital role in job creation, including supporting organizing at private sector companies. By empowering and actively involving community organizations, schools, and places of worship, we aim to strengthen the \"Soul of Chicago,\" nourishing its economic and emotional vibrancy. Goal # 2: Build a Dignified and Empowered Workforce Our vision is a model city where today's workers and the workers of the future are supported, treated with dignity, and enabled to thrive. We aspire to uphold workers' rights fearlessly, increase worker organization and Unions for all, and provide a robust infrastructure that supports workers' needs such as universal childcare, reliable and affordable transportation, paid leave, and healthcare for all. Our vision is to eliminate occupational segregation, ensure fair wages for full-time, part-time, and informal work, and close gender and racial wage gaps. Employers will be partners and held accountable in creating equitable, inclusive, and safe workplaces, free of discrimination, intimidation, harassment, and violence. Goal # 3: Establish Chicago as the Gold Standard in Labor Policy and Governance We aspire to a future where Chicago becomes the gold standard in labor policy. Aligning with the duties of the Office of Labor Standards to promote and enforce Chicago labor standards, we envision a city that prioritizes labor, creates platforms for worker voice, and enables the Office of Labor Standards to ensure fair treatment and wages for all workers. Strategic and equitable decisions will govern funding allocation for workers' rights and workforce development. City policies will support and protect workers, promote workers' rights education, and provide safe and accessible avenues for reporting abuses, free of intimidation, harassment, or retaliation. Goal # 4: Forge a Safe and Healthy ChicagoCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 199 Our shared vision is a Chicago where all workers operate in safe, health-conscious environments across all sectors. The city will actively address specific occupational health and safety concerns related to various industries, ensuring comprehensive healthcare and occupational safety access for all workers. We strive for a proactive, preventative, and universally accessible system of worker protections, where worker safety is a non-negotiable standard. To achieve these visions, this committee has compiled a list of recommendations that could assist the new administration in furthering its policy goals; they are as follows: NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Pr omoting the City of Chicago as a Good Employer: Create a task force to establish new hiring practices so that city employees proportionately reflect the population. Eliminate all gender gaps in pay. End outsourcing of City work and bring positions back into being performed by city employees. Establish a task force to examine and report on problems with recruitment and retention of City employees including length of time to onboard, entry level pay, vacation and insurance coverage for new employees. New hires should be onboarded in 2-4 weeks, not 6 months. W orkforce Development and Equity Initiative: Deepen the work with Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership to expand training and apprenticeship opportunities in marginalized communities, including for residents with ITIN numbers, ensuring access to skill development and job placement programs, including construction, public sector, green and technology jobs of the future. Further, analyze diversity and equity data of city employees and project labor agreements, as well as create outreach pipelines to historically excluded populations for hiring. Labor S tandards Enforcement: Allocate sufficient resources to fully fund and empower the Office of Labor Standards for effective, complaint-driven and strategic enforcement of worker protections, including increased staffing and budget to enhance monitoring, education, and investigation capabilities. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 200 Pr omoting Workforce Diversity: Collaborate with community organizations, labor unions, and businesses to remove hiring barriers, promote workforce diversity, and implement targeted recruitment strategies to address underrepresentation in various industries, including creating job training and readiness program pipelines for Chicago Public Schools and City Colleges students. W orkplace Safety Task Force: Prioritize worker safety by establishing a Mayor's Task Force on Workplace Safety to proactively identify hazards, enforce safety regulations, and promote a culture of safety in workplaces. U niversal Childcare: Advocate for a comprehensive universal childcare system that ensures affordable, high-quality, and accessible childcare services for all families in Chicago. This initiative will support working parents, promote economic stability, and foster the healthy development of children. Ri deshare Living Wages and Safety: Protect rideshare driver safety, create a transparent system for handling driver deactivations, and raise driver wages. LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS: Equi table Development Policies: Champion the adoption of an equitable development policy to ensure community benefits and transparency in development projects, prioritizing affordable housing, local hiring, and environmental sustainability. R esponsible Contracting Policies: Establish responsible contracting standards for all agencies holding service delivery contracts with the City, including childcare, early learning, cleaning and sanitation services, to ensure living wages, high-quality benefits, and job stability for workers. Where possible, contracts should include employer neutrality clauses for when workers seek union representation. C ity-Level Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA): Establish a city-level Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), or comparable office, to enforce occupational safety standards, conduct inspections, and provide additional protection to workers. To measure progress, the Johnson Administration should collaborate with stakeholders and gather data in key areas such as workforce development, workplace violations, representation, and safety. By working together with impacted communities, labor unions, businesses, and relevant government agencies, the administration can establish meaningful and impactful goals that address the specific needs and challenges of workers in Chicago. OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER ACTION During discussions, several recommendations were raised that align with the values of the Johnson Administration but the committee ran out of time to develop comprehensive strategies. These recommendations include: Estab lishing a pilot program in collaboration with Alderpersons and the Deputy Mayor of Labor to train residents in two wards as Workers' Rights Community Navigators. These navigators will empower nonunion ward residents by providing training on workers' rights and supporting them in taking protected concerted actions against exploitative workplace practices. Transforming ward offices into community hubs will cultivate worker power, making Chicago the most worker-friendly city with strong business ethics. Expand the program to all wards within three years, ensure widespread access to resources and support for protecting workers' rights and fostering a more equitable and empowered workforce.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 201 E nvironment and Public Health: When workplaces are being established or expanded, the environmental and public health impacts on the community must be analyzed and addressed. ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS While the above recommendations align with the focus of the Workers' Rights and Labor Subcommittee, additional insights were raised during discussions that complement the Johnson Administration's values. These insights include: F urther dialogue and engagement with stakeholders are needed to build consensus and identify feasible pathways for implementing recommendations in this report, including introducing worker-friendly policies related to scheduling stability and paid sick leave, strengthening anti-retaliation measures to protect whistleblowers reporting labor violations, and working collaboratively with unions and community organizations to advocate for workers' rights and labor protections. S upporting small businesses in complying with labor regulations through education, financial and technical assistance. S trengthening language access services in government programs and outreach efforts to ensure equitable access for workers with limited English proficiency. E xploring opportunities for partnerships to create job opportunities and foster economic vitality in marginalized communities. CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 202 C reating a dedicated office for comprehensive analysis of Tax Increment Financing (TIF) funds to ensure transparency, equitable distribution, and redirect surplus funds to address community needs and promote economic development as outlined in this report. Considering these additional insights can enhance the overall strategy for addressing workers' rights and labor challenges, fostering a more inclusive and equitable Chicago. In conclusion, the Workers' Rights and Labor Subcommittee recognizes the urgency of addressing the persistent challenges faced by workers in Chicago. By implementing the recommended initiatives and engaging stakeholders, the Johnson Administration can create a city that upholds workers' rights, promotes labor equity, and fosters economic prosperity for all. It is through these collective efforts that Chicago can realize its full potential as a city that values and supports its workers and their contributions to its vibrant and thriving communities.CHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 203 GlossaryCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 204 Glossary GOVERNMENTAL ACRONYMS & DEFINITIONS C ity of Chicago Acronyms BA CP: Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection CDO T: Chicago Department of Transportation CD PH: Chicago Department of Public Health CFD: Chicago F ire Department CHA: Chicago H ousing Authority CP D: Chicago Police Department CPS: Chicago Public Schools CT A: Chicago Transit Authority DCASE: Department of C ultural Affairs and Special Events D FSS: Department of Family and Support Services DO B: Department of Buildings DO E: Department of Environment DO H: Department of Housing DO L: Department of Law D PD: Department of Planning and Development D WM: Department of Water Management M OPD: Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities OCEE: Office of Climate and E nvironment Equity O EMC: Office of Emergency Management and Communications O ERJ: Office of Equity and Racial Justice O IG: Office of the Inspector General S tate of Illinois Acronyms DCEO: Department of C ommerce and Economic Opportunity IHDA: I llinois Housing Development Authority ID PH: Illinois Department of Public Health I GA: Office of Intergovernmental Affairs IIP D: Illinois International Port District ILGA: I llinois General AssemblyCHICAGO FOR THE PEOPLE CHICAGOFORTHEPEOPLE.ORG 205 F ederal Government Acronyms CDC: C enters for Disease Control and Prevention HRSA: H ealth Resources & Services Administration HUD : US Department of Housing and Urban Development I CE: US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Pr ogrammatic Acronyms & Definitions CBO: C ommunity Based Organization C ity of Chicago and Chicagoland Programs CARE Pr ogram: the Crisis Assistance Response & Engagement (CARE) Program seeks to ensure that individuals experiencing a mental health crisis are assisted by teams of behavioral health professionals, with resources to address their unmet health and social needs.

Marginalized/S pecial/Vulnerable Populations: Throughout this report there are references to marginalized, vulnerable, and special popula- tions. We recognize that these groups are made vulnerable by our current socio-political structure and the way that interlocking systems of oppression produce structural violence that marginalizes their experiences. These conditions require that those most impacted receive 'spe-cial' consideration to ensure quality of life for all Chicagoans. We examined these experiences throughout this report recognizing the margins as a place of power. Those most marginalized include, but are not limited to, people who identify within the LGTBQIA+ populations, older adults, disabled Chicagoans, people racialized as Black and other racial/ethnic groups, people who only speak a language other than English, immigrant and refugee groups, formerly incarcerated people, and people experiencing poverty.

Community engagement is an ongoing process. The recommendations in the Transition Report are intended to serve as a starting place - we know that people also have much more to share! We are grateful to the nearly 400 Co-Chairs and participants who dedicated many hours to meeting, debating, and sharing ideas and recommendations for Mayor Johnson. We're grateful to everyone who came together over the last five weeks to share their ideas for building a safer, better, stronger Chicago.
