Since many of the questions posed in the consultation document are not wholly relevant to the Health Protection Committee and there are other issues we would like to raise, our comments are provided in bullet points as follow s: We acknowledge and welcome the proposals to develop a more integrated approach to sustainably manage Wales' natural resources. However, we feel that the consultation document would be improved by including more information of the influence that natural resources can have on population health, wellbeing and quality of life, as well as other wider health determinants such as the economy, community and housing quality. The relationships between health and the environment in its widest sense are significant. Whitehead and Dahlgren stated many years ago that, in its simplest sense, health is a function of a person's socio -economic and environmental circumstances, as well as hereditary and personal influences.1 The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that globally , 24% of the burden of disease can be attributed to environmental stressors.2 In the UK, this estimate is lower, but still a significant 14%.2 There is no doubt that the relatively new Natural Resources Wales (NRW) agency should lead much of what the White Paper proposes, but a comprehensive Environment Bill should ultimately recognise the role s that other bodies can play in achieving a more integrated management of W ales' natural resources. Health Boards, Public Health Wales, Local Authorities an d others can make a significant contribution to help achieve the objectives outlined in the White Paper . As such, whilst it is essential for an Environment Bill to complement other emerging Welsh Government policies such as the Future Generations, Planning Reform, Housing, Heritage and Access Bills, it is prudent for similar links to be made with the proposed Public Health Bill. Similarly, whilst there is a proposal to require other bodies to cooperate, share information, jointly plan and report on sustain able environment matters, the White Paper fails to recognise the reciprocal of this i.e. how NRW can and must support other agencies achieve their strategic goals. In other words, as well as stating what \"other key players need to do to deliver the opportu nities identified in order to optimise the sustainable management of natural resources\", an Environment Bill should set out what NRW needs to do to deliver the opportunities identified in order to optimise population 1 Dahlgren G, Whitehead M (1991). Policies and strategies to promote social equity in health. Stockholm: Institute for Future Studies. 2 WHO (2008 ). The global burden of disease: 2004 update . WHO: Geneva, Switzerland. 2 health, wellbeing and quality of life i n Wales. Developing Single Integrated Plans (SIPs) through Local Service Boards (that take into account Local Development Plans and other strategic documents) will facilitate this and generate opportunities to collaborate to jointly identify and implement work priorities and plans. The White paper sets out the need to increase the resilience of our natural resources by preparing for future challenges, such as those presented by climate change. Vulnerability to climate change is manifested by an increase in extreme events, such as flooding, storms and gales, changing rain patterns and heat waves. In her 2012 -13 Annual Report the Chief Medical Officer recommended t he Welsh Government and Public Health Wales should work with local and national agencies, such a s the NHS, local government and Natural Resources Wales, to improve community resilience, the provision of public health advice and the implementation of recovery strategies to respond to extreme weather and other natural events. The White Paper provides an opportunity to consider environmental challenges including flood risk management and recovery. One potential Improvement to flood management could be the creation of a Welsh Flood Forum , similar to that already in place in Scotland , to provide support for and represents those who are affected by or are at risk of flooding . Adopting an 'area -base approach' is sensible as it is inappropriate to apply a 'one size fits all' model across Wales. It will be important for an Environment Bill to not only consid er the natural resources local context but also the local context in terms of health and other influencing factors. However, care should be taken when implementing actions against identified work priorities and plans through an 'area -based approach' since many partner organisations have an all -Wales remit ; efforts should be made to ensure consistency , reduce existing inequalities and minimise the creation of new inequalities . The proposal to test and trial experimental schemes or projects to address work p riorities is welcomed. To increase the effectiveness and impacts of such projects, a collaborative approach should be taken to plan and implement them. To determine effectiveness, all projects should be subject to formal evaluation which quantifies not jus t environmental impacts but also health and other outcomes . The White Paper makes several proposals to refine the regulatory framework that underpins current and future natural resource management. The suggestion to \"tidy up\" existing legislation in the in terim is sensible as this is likely to inform the development of a more coherent and integrated future regulatory framework. Such a review should take account of new and emerging technolog ies to access natural resources - for example shale gas extraction. Protecting and improving air, water and land quality across Wales is a priority but little reference, if any, is made to reacting to pollution and/or contamination problems. 3 Instead, the emphasis seems to be on being proactive . Whilst this is entirely ap propriate, it is equally important for an Environment Bill to ensure that any proposals do not detract from the need for NRW to maintain its existing role in responding to incidents, both in terms of preparedness and response. Waste management proposals a re described in detail in the White Paper . We welcome this but would ask that the Environment Bill also considers and puts measures in place to minimise the possibility of adverse knock -on effects from these proposals that may impact local environments and public health and increase the work loads of NRW and others. Ways to increase rates of recycling are an example of this where it is likely that more waste materials will need to be stored for sorting at Materials Recovery Facilities. In Wales, over the pa st couple of years, numbers of fires (accidental and deliberate) at legal and illegal waste facilities have increased; these proposals may actually raise the risk of fires occurring at such sites and so the regulatory framework should be tailored and stren gthened to avoid this. We welcome the proposal to give NRW a new power to enter into management agreements with any landowner or business so as to achieve the actions required for the sustainable management of natural resources. However, t here is also a nee d to consider how environmental controls are maintained, not just when ownership changes, but when business es are in financial difficulty and become insolvent. . The priorities of liquidators are focused on mitigating the financial and legal impact of a company failure rather than meeting their obligations of existing environmental controls and the protect ion of public health . This potential gap in regulatory control is worthy of consideration, particularly in the current period of austerity. It may als o be an opportunity to use the General Binding rules concept . In relation to Development Control, careful thought should be given to greater linkage between the Planning and Environmental Permit application processes in Wales. This will ensure that potent ial environment and health impacts are identified at the earliest opportunity and timely action s can be taken to avoid, reduce or mitigate against risks. Doing this will also serve to minimise confusion amongst Planning Authorities, Regulators, consultees and communities. Also, a n Environmental Bill should not just consider the role of Strategic Environmental Assessments in shaping Wales' communities but also that of (integrated) Health Impact A ssessment . The Welsh Government Nature Fund will provide a re al opportunity not just to benefit nature but also public health. Consideration should be given to a prioritisation process that promotes projects that meet both objectives. For example the remediat ion of contaminated land to reduce impacts on the ecosyste m could also reduce the risk to humans from exposure to contaminants and benefit public health. This would be more sustainable and s uch projects could also improve access to promote healthier lifestyle activity - for example walking or cycling. 4 Finally, w e are surprised there is no mention of the need to share data and information between partner agencies to facilitate the monitoring of trends and patterns in environmental indicators , hazards and their impacts. It is recognised that environmental hazard di stribution, exposures and impacts can vary across Wales and this may lead to social or environmental injustice concerns and health inequalities. It would be extremely beneficial from a public health perspective for Natural Resources Wales to consider the potential merits in sharing intelligence and data to inform related surveillance work and identify possible research opportunities. Moving forward, it would be prudent for Natural Resources Wales to consider the contribution it can make to the evolving envi ronment and health surveillance ambitions of Public Health Wales . We trust these comments are of use to you. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 1 Towards the Sustainable Management of Wales' Natural Resources Environment Bill White Paper - Consultat ion Responses We want your views on our proposals for an Environment Bill. Your views are important . We believe the new legislation will make a difference to people' s lives. This White Paper is open for public consultation and we welcome your comments. The consultation will close on 15 January 2014. To help record and analyse the responses, please structure your comments around the following questions. You do not need to comment on all questions. The Welsh Government will run a series of engagement events across Wales on the White Paper during the co nsultation period. Please submit your comments by 15 January 2014.

It may also be seen by other Welsh Government staff to help them plan future consultations. The Welsh Government intends to publish a summary of the responses to this document. We may also publi sh responses in full. Normally, the name and address (or part of the address) of the person or organisation who sent the response are published with the response. This helps to show that the consultation was carried out properly. If you do not want your na me or address published, please tick the box below. We will then blank them out. Names or addresses we blank out might still get published later, though we do not think this would happen very often. The Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Environmenta l Information Regulations 2004 allow the public to ask to see information held by many public bodies, including the Welsh Government. This includes information which has not been published. However, the law also allows us to withhold information in some c ircumstances. If anyone asks to see information we have withheld, we will have to decide whether to release it or not. If someone has asked for their name and address not to be published, that is an important fact we would take into account. However, there might sometimes be important reasons why we would have to reveal someone's name and address, even though they have asked for them not to be published. We would get in touch with the person and ask their views before we finally decided to reveal the inform ation.

Yes No Please provide comment: We welcome the opportunity to comment on this White Paper and support the proposal to adopt an integrated approach to natural resource management in Wales. The four Local Records Centres (LRCs) in Wales are concerned with the collation, management and dissemination of biodiversity data and we are therefore pleased that the white paper recognises the importance of the evidence -based approach. F or the Environment Bill to deliver its proposed outcomes, it is vital that existing relationship s between public bodies such as NRW and organisations such as the four Welsh LRCs are confirmed and strengthened. We must maximise the benefits of the resources of information, knowledge and skills contained within the LRCs and limited resources must not be allocated to projects which duplicate existing arrangements . Having stated our support, we do however have some concerns that the there is too much vagueness surrounding much of what is described in the White Paper. The general approach seems to be that Welsh Government ( WG) is seeking a broad consensus on what is currently a very vaguely -defined way forward . Successful delivery of its broad aims will rely on powers of secondary legislation and detailed policies that are not yet proposed or ag reed. Question 2 Do you agree with the approach to define natural resources, sustainable management of natural resources and integrated natural resource management in Wales? Yes No Please provide comment: We are pleased that concise definitions have been provided for consultation and that the tone of the definitions is clearly one of long -term sustainable management of resources, rather than their exploitation. However, we do have strong concerns that the term 'biodiversity' seems to have been om itted in favour of 'biological resources'. There has been a significant emphasis on biodiversity conservation over the past two decades and the omission of the term risks disenfranchising huge numbers of people. Whatever definition is ultimately agreed, i t needs to be explained and promoted to a public audience across Wales in clear and simple terms. The public has taken time to embrace the term 'biodiversity' and we would not wish to complicate matters by removing it from the new terminology utilised with in natural resource management. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 4 Question 3 Do you agree that climate resilience and climate change mitigation should be embedded into our proposed approach to integrated natural resource management at both national and local levels? Yes No Please provide comment: Yes, this is a very important issue for Wales and it needs to be integrated into our new legislation. We believe that biodiversity change is a very sensitive i ndicator of climate change and that evidence held by LRCs in Wales (now and in the future) should be fully utilised to monitor climate change and resilience at the local and Wales -wide scales. Question 4 Do you agree that the setting of national outcomes and priority actions for natural resource management should follow the five -year cycle for national outcome setting as proposed in the Future Generations Bill? Yes No Please provide comment: The five -year cycle of setting and reporting on priorities seems sensible. We hope that processes adopted are simple and not burdensome on a ny parties involved. WG needs to ensure that right evidence is available to measure success or failure and therefore it will need t o plan how evidence is gathered and managed at the outse t. The types of data required for measuring and reporting outcomes may not currently exist. Although LRC Wales hope to be involved in reporting, it should not be assumed that we have the data or resources to assist without some careful forward planning. The t iming of target -setting and reporting rounds should, if possible, be co -ordinated with other major national/international reporting obligations and targets, e.g. Article 17 Habitats Directive reporting, EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 target to half biodi versity loss, future State of Nature in Wales reporting. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 5 Question 5 Do you agree that the area -based approach will help provide a clear, prioritised and focussed approach to delivery? Yes No Please provide comment: It is clearly necessary to tackle natural resource management at a local or regional scale within Wales rather than at the whole country scale. Considering the regular historical (and likely future ) re-drawing of administrative boundaries, it seems that a system utilising natural boundaries (such as catchm ents) may be a sensible option. Downsides will be that boundaries will not match those of any partner organisations and it is likely that regional organisations such as the LRCs will have to engage with natural resource plans and initiative s across multipl e catchments. We have some concerns whether all options have been fully examined at this stage, as catchments seem to be the only area -based example proposed in the White Paper. It seemed from attendance at the November 20 13 Natural Resource Management c onference and the subsequent White Paper consultation workshops that the choice of catchments is a fait accompli . Will a catchment -based approach will be flexible enough for the broad ecosystem services approach ? Problems may occur at the margins of catchments (e.g. watersheds or coastal areas) and at national boundaries (e.g. where parts of Wales lie within English catchments). It is also hard to envisage how this approach will work unless there is full coverage across Wales. We also wondered whether approaches need to be spatial or whether there is an opportunity to organise initiatives by relevant topics or themes. Whichever area -based approach is adopted, We would like to see a commitment to gathering and maki ng best use of data for each of the defined areas . This commitment will allow better access to data across all parties and also provide a legacy dataset for use on further work within the same or an overlapping area. We therefore believe that when defining the area, it is important to plan the data which may be available or required and for this to translated into a more detailed 'data plan ' for each of the projects or programmes undertaken in the area. In doing this all those involved in the area will be a ble to make best use of the available evidence. We believe LRCs could provide an independent and experienced hub for this data, coordinating it across the areas and each of those involved in its management. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 6 Question 6 Do you agree that the approach is flexible enough to enable significant elements of the plans for natural resource managemen t to be replaced in the future? Yes No Please provide comment: Whatever approach is adopted certainly needs to be flexible enough to be future -proof. Question 7 Do you agree with placing a requirement on other public bodies to co -oper ate in the area-based approach ? Yes No Please provide comment: We welcome the move for public bodies to \" co-operate, share information, jointly plan for and jointly report on the management of natural resources\" and for them to develop a \"consistent evidence base\". However we believe there is a necessity for the information to be shared outside public bodies, so that information can be used by other sectors, allowing innovative ways of managing our natural resources. We are concerned that the remit to develop an evidence base lies with NRW and hope that they do this through continued support for the Welsh LRC s, thereby allowing continued access to the species records we hold (over 6 million, as at January 2014). Question 8 Do you agree that NRW should be the lead reporting authority for natural resources? Yes No Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 7 Please provide comment: It is difficult to know from the White Paper what reporting r esponsibilities NRW will have. Will they be to Welsh Government or directly to the UK or European Governments? If it is the latter, we hope that Welsh Government will continue to keep a strong watching brief over the reporting powers of NRW and give them s ufficient resources to be able to do this effectively. If NRW are the lead reporting authority, we believe they need to have access to the best available evidence. For this to happen we believe it is important that Welsh Government and NRW support the co llation of Wales -wide biodiversity data through Welsh LRCs. In the past biodiversity reporting has not always consistently accessed data held by the LRCs, however with a planned approach we believe data held at the Wales level can be rapidly and consistent ly accessed by NRW for a range of reporting purposes. We believe therefore it is important that NRW agrees with LRCs in Wales what data are required and for this to form an integral part of any agreement made between it and LRC Wales. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 8 Question 9 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals (for example, impacts on your organisation)? The Environment Bill presents a great opportunity to enshrin e in law the need for a robust evidence base, and to further develop and enhance the relationship between LRCs, NRW and other agencies. We agree with a need for a more integrated approach underpinned by a sound evidence base. However we are concerned that there will be may be duplication of effort if NRW does not integrate information held in Welsh LRCs within the evidence base and that they also need to be proactive about sharing the information with others. We would like to see a strong dialogue between NRW and Welsh LRCs, so that for its extended powers NRW can access the best avai lable biodiversity data in the most efficient method. We are confident that the LRCs in Wales are sufficiently flexible to respond to the impacts and meet the challenge s of the proposals, but for this to happen we must have regular and effective dialogue with NRW . Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 9 Chapter 3 - Natural Resources Wales - new opportunities to deliver Question 10 Do you agree with the proposals set out in chapter 3 in relation to new ways of working for NRW? Yes No Please provide comment: Although we are in favour of the development of new opportunities, we are concerned that biodiversity does not get lost amongst the opportunities which may generate revenue. We hope that NRW will continue to give a high priority to biodiversity and that when new oppor tunities arise they will wherever possible make the benefits for biodiversity one of the key outcomes from the opportunity. This is important as biodiversity provides a key ecosystem service, but one which is difficult to quantify in monetary terms. A further proviso is that any new ways of working adopted should retain the need for decisions to be based on robust evidence. Where NRW looks to other organisations to help fulfil its outputs, these organisations should also be required to source and share e vidence. Question 11 What limitations or safeguards on the use of powers might be necessary to enable NRW to trial innovative approaches to integrated natural resource management? It is important that NRW uses the best available evidence to support its approach, whether this is innovative or not. However perhaps it is even more important to use the best evidence when something is untried, at least to justify the reasoning for this a pproach. Furthermore we would recommend that when building innovative approaches NRW considers the sort of evidence it wishes to use, how that is best procured and how any out -coming evidence is best stored, managed and shared. We therefore believe that b etter planning of the data requirements of these new approaches would reap both immediate and long -term benefits. We hope that LRCs can be involved in developing this process with NRW. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 10 Question 12 Do you agree that NRW are an appropriate body to act as facilitators, brokers and accreditors of Payments for Ecosystem Services Schemes? Yes No If 'yes', do you consider that there is a need for any new powers to help to further opportunities for PES? NRW should be able to do this as they should have access to all the necessary evidence with which to make decisions. In order to ensure that ecosystem services continue to be provided by those who are in receipt of payment, mandatory surveying and reporting should ta ke place, with the results placed in the public domain in a format that is easily accessible. LRCs could be utilised to provide data for broking and accreditation of PES Schemes as well as receiving data from future surveys. A concern would be that were N RW to have a role as 'buyer' then additional funding would have to be provided to meet this unless this was in the form of 'cross trading' with NRW providing support in other ways. Question 13 What should be the extent of NRW' s power to enter into management agreements? We a gree that it is appropriate that the extent should be limited to the objectives and that agreements should run with the land. In addition, individual agreements need to tak e into account what NRW needs to meet those objectives , i.e. effective monitoring providing robust evidence, in keeping with the proposed reporting cycle and high -level objectives to meet European and global targets. Question 14 Recognising that there are some existing powers in this respect, where are the opportunities for General Binding Rules to be established beyond their existing scope? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 11 No comment Question 15 In relation to Welsh Ministers' amendment powers, do you support: a) the initial proposal to limit it to NRW's functions, subject to conditions as stated); or b) the additional proposal to cover broader environmental legislation, subject to conditions as stated? A B Please provide comment: Broadly support A. Concerns with B that existing primary legislation conferring protection on wildlife and habitats has evolved over time to meet wider obligations. Without knowing what Integrated Natural Resource Management will look like, we cannot at this stage support t he power to amend that legislation in the future. Wildlife does not heed political boundaries. Question 16 Please state any specific evidence of areas of potential conflict or barriers between the objectives of integrated natural resource management and the application of existing legislation.

Yes No Please provide comment: Broad support for a clear legal framework and statutory basis for integrated resource management using an ecosystems approach. The approach is inevitably complex and wide -ranging and the details / mechanisms for implementation will be critical to success . Question 2 Do you agree with the approach to define natural resources, sustainable management of natural resources and integrated natural resource management in Wales? Yes No Please provide comment: Need to emphasise the principles of the Ecosystems Approach, including recognise that ecosystems must be managed within the limits of their functioning (Principle 6). Whilst the document highlights the sustainable use of natural resources, there is more limited consideration of biodiversity an d nature conservation management . For example there is no explicit reference to meeting the Wales, UK, EU an d UN Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) 2020 targets. The conservation of biodiversity must be accepted as a central tenet of sustainable development , and not secondary to economic and social development. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 4 Question 3 Do you agree that climate resilience and climate change mitigation should be embedded into our proposed approach to integrated natural resource management at both national and local levels? Yes No Please provide comment: There ar e significant and wide -ranging risks presented by c limate change and this should be factored into ecosystems managemen t and national and local levels f or the reasons outlined in sections 2.27-2.29. Question 4 Do you agree that the setting of national outcomes and priority actions for natural resource management should follow the five -year cycle for national outcome setting as proposed in the Future Generations Bill? Yes No Please provide comment: The setting of national outcomes and priorities will assist is providing a clear framework for action. This will need to be supported by a clear evidence base against which actions can be measured. This will also assist in formulating programm es and actions at the local level and in encouraging organisations to cooperate, share information and engage in joint working (e.g. through Local Service Boards, LBAP Partnerships , etc. ). Question 5 Do you agree that the area -based approach will help provide a clear, prioritised and focussed approach to delivery? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 5 Yes (with qualifications) No Please provide comment: Broadly support an area -based approach . However the nature and scope of Area - based plans requires detailed consideration, as does the consideration of how organisations such as the Local Authorities work on the ground. The relationship with other plans and strategies is also crucial, for example the effect of Proposal NRM4 an d its implications for the production of Local Development Plans (LDP) . There are indeed a number of issues that need to be considered in relation to LDPs: It is probable that a management a rea would falls within two or three authority areas, all of which may be at different stages in their Local Development Plan (LDP) process. What is the effect of designation of an area for an LDP: if a Local Planning Authority has an adopted LDP, does this new desi gnation require an immediate review of the LDP ? It is conceivable that an LDP and a management plan may have competing requirements. How would these be reconciled and which plan has primacy? (in the longer term this may be less of an issue as processes ar e dovetailed) In order to avoid potential conflicts it would be desirable for the strategic aims of area plans to be incorporated in LDPs. In this way the strategic requirements for land -use planning and ecosystems management (on land) are integrated / coordinated effectively. Other factors / considerations include: The need to ensure a link with Single Integrated Plans. The definition of Areas. Will these be based on river catchments and if so how the system take account the management of other 'natura l areas' (e.g. the Cambrian Mountains). The mechanism for working with local authorities and other local interests in devising area based plans (for example are area based partnerships to be formed?) . The arrangements for engagement with partner organisations will be critical; including direct involvement in the planning process : the comments made above regarding integration with LDPs are also relevant here , as is the role of Local Service Boards . the relationship with other plans and strategies (both land and marine based) Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 6 Question 6 Do you agree that the approach is flexible enough to enable significant elements of the plans for natural resource managemen t to be replaced in the future? Yes (with qualifications) No Please provide comment: It is assumed that this question related to other plans and strategies which cover elements of the natural environment and its use (as listed in section 2.72 of the consultation document). It is likely that the approach would be flexible enough for the higher level / strategic plans to be replaced in the future (e.g. river basis plans; national flood and coastal erosion strategy). However, there would also be concern over the possibility of the NERC duty being removed and not being replaced by a similar requirement. Other plans and strategies have a more local and specific purpose; these will continue to have an important role in helping to deliver national and local objectives , in biodiversity management and in facilitating community engagemen t. Question 7 Do you agree with placing a requirement on other public bodies to co -oper ate in the area -based approach ? Yes No Please provide comment: Cooperation with the local authority is essential as the local authority will be an important delivery partner given the range of functions relevant to resource management. Reference to the LDP and Single Integrated Plan and the role of Local Service Boards has already been made (see respon se to Question 5). Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 7 Question 8 Do you agree that NRW should be the lead reporting authority for natural resources? Yes No Please provide comment: There will nevertheless be a need for effective communication with other organisations that can assist in evidence gathering (e.g. Local Record Centres; LBAP Partnerships). Question 9 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals (for example, impacts on your organisation)? Additional comments are as follows: Management should be carried out at the lowest appropriate (i.e. principle 2 of the ecosystems approach). This closer the management is to the ecosystem, the greater the responsibility, ownership, accountability, participation and use of local knowledge. The key role of loc al authorities in delivering area based management actions and a clear understanding of how Local Authorities work on the ground . The importance of working in partnership, in particular with local authorities and LBAP Partnerships, and associated NRW suppo rt mechanisms (grant aid and locally -based NRW staff). The desirability of establishing those requirements to be delivered by local authorities in order that the resource implications can be identified (and provision made). Identification of one lead officer where possible to deal with Local Authorities in these areas in order to make the process of working simpler. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 8 Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 9 Chapter 3 - Natural Resources Wales - new opportunities to deliver Question 10 Do you agree with the proposals set out in chapter 3 in relation to new ways of working for NRW? Yes No Please provide comment: Broadly support the approach outlined in the consultation document under proposal NRM7 , subject to safeguards to protect . Paying for services is potentially a positive way for business es and landowners to appreciate the value of the environment. However, there is a risk to this that they will be getting paid for things they s hould already be doing and appropriate management might not continue unless payments are received. There is also the issue of lo ng term sustainability and take -up of these schemes. More information is needed. Simultaneous applications for different consents are supported in principle . However this would require much further discussion to ensure that targets are still able to be met from all sides e.g. if discharge consents were to be agreed at the same time as planning permission . In principle a reduction in bureaucra cy would be beneficial . However, caution should be tak en to not dilute the importance of the requirements and appropriate fines would need t o be a deterrent. Question 11 What limitations or safeguards on the use of powers might be necessary to enable NRW to trial innovative approaches to integrated natural resource management? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 10 Whilst it is important that the value of ecosystems services are recognised, it should also be recognised that nature conservation has its own intrinsic value and there are inherent risks in seeking to apply monetary values to the natural environment. Nature conservation legislation must not be endangered in developing this approach. Question 12 Do you agree that NRW are an appropriate body to act as facilitators, brokers and accreditors of Payments for Ecosystem Services Schemes? Yes No If 'yes', do you consider that there is a need for any new powers to help to further opportunities for PES? See comments made in response to Q10. Question 13 What should be the extent of NRW's power to enter into management agreements? No comments. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 11 Question 14 Recognising that there are some existing powers in this respect, where are the opportunities for General Binding Rules to be established beyond their existing scope? See comments made in response to Q10. Question 15 In relation to Welsh Ministers' amendment powers, do you support: a) the initial proposal to limit it to NRW's functions, subject to conditions as stated); or b) the additional proposal to cover broader environmental legislation, subject to conditions as s tated? A B Please provide comment: Further consideration is required on this matter . Question 16 Please state any specific evidence of areas of potential conflict or barriers between the objectives of integrated natural resource management and the application of existing legislation. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 12 Further details and consideration is required on this matter . Question 17 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals, for example, on your business or organisation? Simultaneous applications for different consents are supported in principle. However this would require much further discussion to ensure that targets are still able to be met from all sides e.g. if discharge consents were to be agreed at the same time as planning perm ission . Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 13 Chapter 4 - Resource Efficiency Waste Segregation and Collection Question 18 Do you agree with the package of proposals in chapter 4 in relation to the regulation of waste segregation and approach of combining the 5 measures together? Yes No Please provide comment: Ceredigion supports the aims of the Environment Bill in maximising both the quality and quantity of materials available for recycling, protecting the environment and supporting the Welsh economy. The Council does have reservations however in relation to t he proposal to extend the range of materials that should be collected separately. Ceredigion County Council believes that the consultation document is misleading by stating that current legislation requires \"anyone collecting waste will need to collect paper, glass, metal and plastic by separate collection...\" The Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011 (as amended) will require, from January 2015, that anyone collecting paper, metal, plastic or glass to do so by separate collection. Whilst the difference in drafting may be slight, it is important that the Welsh Government clarifies its proposals. Extending a requirement to \"anyone collecting waste will need to collect paper, glass, metal, plastic, card, wood, and food waste by separate collection\" is very different to a proposal to extend a requirement for \"anyone collecting paper, glass, metal, plastic, card, wood, and food waste should do so by separate collection\". The latter merely states the method of collection, whereas the former would impo se additional service requirements upon Local Authorities at a time of unprecedented financial constraints. The Council has repeatedly stated that it believes decisions on waste collections should be made locally, reflecting local circumstances, the \"one size does not fit all\" argument. The County Council has some concern that the separate collection of wood is both logistically challenging for Ceredigion and unnecessary. The Authority has already put in place adequate arrangements for the collection of wood waste at its network of Household Waste Sites. Ceredigion County Council is concerned that the Welsh Government is consulting on its proposals to extend the requirement for separate collection when guidance on what is \"technically, economically and environmentally practicable\" is still awaited. In the absence of such guidance, the extent of the current legislative requirements remains uncertain. It is clear that this \"TEEP\" test will be critical to Local Authorities in planning waste collection serv ices and Ceredigion County Council would urge the Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 14 Welsh Government to address the uncertainties as a matter of some urgency. Are there any other materials or waste streams which should be included in the requirements to sort and separately collect? Yes No If yes, what are they, and why should they be chosen? N/A Question 19 Do you agree that the level of segregation asked of individuals / businesses is acceptable? Yes No If no, please state why and an alternative. Ceredigion County Council supports the principle of the proposal to place a duty on waste producers to present their recyclable waste for collection. However the suggestion that \"as minimum separation criteria, waste could be separated by the business waste producer into separate streams of metal and plastic, glass, co -mingled paper/card, food waste, wood and a residual stream\" is unhelpful and appears to be inconsistent with the separate collection proposals discussed above. The County Council would suggest that the separation criteria for waste producers would need to be consistent with the requirements of the waste collector. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 15 Question 2 0 Are there any particular types or sizes of businesses where it would not be technically, environmentally or economically practicable to keep the 7 waste streams separate at source? Yes No If yes, please identify them and explain why. The Council considers that the vast majority of its commercial customers would not have sufficient space to store 7 waste streams separately, as they are predominantly SMEs. The Council also considers that it would not be technically, environmentally or economically practicable for it to collect 7 waste streams separately given the very rural nature of Ceredigion. Question 2 1 Do you agree with the materials that we propose to ban from landfill or energy from waste facilities? Yes No Are there any other materials which should be banned from landfill or energy from waste facilities? Yes No If yes, what are they? The County Council supports the principle of maximising the recycling of waste materials wherever possible. The Council also supports the conversion of residual waste to energy for those materials that cannot be recycled. The Council considers that the current legislative requirements, in particular the high statutory recycling targets in Wales, are sufficient to drive sustainable waste management practices, particularly through recycling. Energy from Waste and landfill bans are therefore considered to be unnecessary. In addition, the Council has some concerns regarding the specifi c proposals. In relation to uncontaminated paper, card and plastic, the Council can envisage a Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 16 number of scenarios under which EfW may be preferable to recycling. For paper and card, ecological foot -printing analysis \"shows a greater benefit for efficient Energy from Waste treatment over composting. So, if recycling options are not available, this will be the preferred route1.\" The proposal to ban paper and card from Energy from Waste facilities will therefore result in poorer environmental outc omes in circumstances where recycling options are not available. This is particularly the case for low grade paper and card for which recycling options are limited. A similar situation exists for plastics whereby, in ecological foot -printing terms, both high efficiency EfW treatment and landfill are preferable to open -loop recycling1. The County Council considers that current legislative instruments, in particular the very challenging nature of the Welsh Government's statutory recycling targets, are already potentially driving Local Authorities to choose less sustainable treatment solutions and this situation will be compounded by further restrictions which clearly result in perverse outcomes. The Council has some concerns that should recycling markets for any of the specified materials fail, all other sustainable treatment solutions would be closed and landfilling of the materials would also no longer be an option under the proposals. The Council has some concern therefore that such bans may give rise to fly -tipping or illegal waste disposal activities. In relation to the banning of \"untreated wood\", the Council considers the use of wood in biomass combustion systems to be a valuable and sustainable alternative to fossil fuel heating systems and would welcome the exclusion of biomass facilities, along with Anaerobic Digestion facilities from the duties of the proposals. The Council has some concern that the proposals in relation to Energy from Waste bans comes at a poor time. Many Local Authority con sortia are nearing final stages of competitive dialogue as part of the Welsh Government Procurement Programme and may have entered into long term contractual obligations in terms of the composition of residual waste. Question 2 2 Do you agree that developing guidance for acceptable levels of contamination in residual waste for landfill/ incinerator operators and the regulator is a workable approach? Yes No 1 \"Towards Zero Waste, Collections, Infrastructure and Markets Sector Plan for Consultation \", The Welsh Assembly Government, March 2011 Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 17 If no, what other approach could we adopt? See response to Question 21. Question 2 3 Do you agree that there should be a prohibition on the disposal of food waste to sewer? Yes No If yes, should this apply to: a) Households b) Businesses and Public Sector c) Both Please provide comment: Ceredigion County Council supports the treatment of food waste by Anaerobic Digestion. The Council has some concerns about how the food waste would be identified and how a ban would be enforced. It also considers that regulating this would be an onerous additional task for any Local Authority at a time when cutbacks are being made. Question 2 4 Do you have any comments about how such a prohibition should be enforced with i) businesses and public sector and ii) households? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 18 See response to Q uestion 23. Question 2 5 Do you agree that lead in times for the proposals are reasonable? Yes No If no, what alternative lead in time would you suggest? Given that guidance is still awaited in relation to the \"TEEP\" test and contamination limits, the Council has some concern that the lead times are ambitious. In addition, the Council has long term contractual obligations in place and urges the Welsh Government to consider the arrangements that Local Authorities have already put in place. Question 2 6 Do you agree that NRW are the best placed organisation to regulate the duty to source segregated wastes? If no, please give the reason and propose an alternative regulatory body. Yes No See response to Question 21. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 19 Question 27 In your opinion, who is the most appropriate body to regulate the bans on disposal of food waste to sewer for businesses and the public sector: NRW Local Authorities Sewerage undertaker or Other If 'Other' please propose an alternative regulatory body and state reasons: See response to Question 23. Question 2 8 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals (for example, impacts on your organisation)? No furt her comments than those given above. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 20 Carrier Bags Question 29 Do you agree with the proposal to extend the enabling powers of the Welsh Ministers so that they may, by regulations, provide for minimum charges to be set for other types of carrier bags in addition to single use carrier bags? Yes No Please provide comment However clear communication s need to be considered in order not to undermine efforts by Local Authorities promoting the re -use of items such as re -usable carrier bags. Question 3 0 Do you agree with the proposal to extend the enabling powers of the Welsh Ministers so that they may, by regulations, require retailers to pass on their net proceeds to any good causes? Yes No Please provide comment No comment. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 21 Question 31 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals (for example, impacts on your organisation)? Question 31 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals (for example, impacts on your organisation)? Yes No To be added. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 22 Chapter 5 - Smarter Management Marine Licensing Management Question 3 2 Do you agree with the proposals in relation to Marine Licensing? Yes No Please provide comment There is currently an issue that the Marine Licensing team is overstretched and as a result the service is taking longer that it should. This is not a criticism of the existing staff, but the level of resource that is made available for dealing with licence requests. The Authority has no issue with the proposals a s long as the level of service is improved as a result, although it is difficult to provide a definitive response without knowing the scale of fees involved or the level of improvement to the efficiency and certainty of a timely response which could be exp ected as a result. Question 3 3 Do you have any comments on whether the Welsh Government should extend NRW's ability to recover costs associated with marine licensing by charging fees for: - pre-application costs? - variation costs? - costs of transferring of licenses? - covering regulatory costs, via subsistence changes? The only concern here is that some of the monitoring measures proposed by consultees during the licence application and monitoring processes are tenuous to say the least. If fees were to be rais ed for this regulating role, the County Council would expect the monitoring requirements to be limited to those which are relevant to the scheme for which a licence is requested, and not i nclude measures which another organisation would want to s ee included simply for their own organisation's benefit / use. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 23 Question 3 4 Do you have any comments relating to the impact of the proposals? No additional comments to those provi ded above. Shellfisheries Management Question 3 5 Do you agree with the proposal in relation to Shellfishery Orders? Yes No Please provide comment The proposals appear sensible and should allow for better protection of the marine environment as well as being more workable for fishermen. There is recognition that any orders with the potential to impact European sites would require HRAs, and by formalising shellfishery management plans, gives the flexibility to adjust management if required to address issues th at develop during the life of the plan. What appears to be less clear is what consultation there would be on amendments to management plans, once orders have been approved. Where there is the potential to impact European Marine Sites it would be helpful to clarify that NRW (and other Relevant Authorities if appropriate) are to be consulted. Note: It is understood that there are no several or regulating orders in Ceredigion's waters but it is conceivable that there might be applications for them in the future. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 24 Question 3 6 Are there any other changes to the Several and Regulating Order regime that you think should be considered (i.e. can you think of any other ways that current practices could be improved)? Yes No Please provide comment No comments. Question 3 7 Do you have any comments on the impact of this proposal (for example, impacts on your business)? No additional comments to those provided above. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 25 Land Drainage Management / Flood and Water Management Question 3 8 Do you agree with the proposal in relation to changes to Section 29 of the Land Drainage Act (1991)? Yes No Please provide comment The County Council a grees with the proposal in relation to changes to Section 29 as there is clear ly a gap in the existing legislation. Question 39 Do you agree with the proposal in relation to changes to Section 47 of the Flood and Water Management Act (2010)? Yes No Please provide comment The Council a grees with the proposal in relation to changes to Section 47 as there is a need to ensure that Welsh Ministers have equivalent powers to those of the Secretary of State. Question 4 0 Do you have any comments on the impac t of either of these proposals? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 26 No additional comments to those provided above. Implementation / Equalities Question 4 1 We want to ensure that the Environment Bill is reflective of the needs of Welsh Citizens. As such, we would appreciate any views in relation to any of the proposals in this White Paper that may have an impact on a) Human rights b) Welsh language or c) the protected characteristics as prescribed within the Equality Act 2010. These characteristics include gender; age; religion; race; sexual orientation; trans gender; marriage or Civil Partnership; Pregnancy and Maternity; and, disability. No comments. Question 4 2 Do consultees have any other comments or useful information in relation to any of the proposals in this White Paper? Other comments: Sustainable development should underpin the Future Generations Bill. Whilst sustainable development is very much integrated into the Environments Bill, the core principle of the Bill should be the environment, and the sustainable use of it.

Covering letter The Environment Bill Team Climate Change and Natural Resource Policy Division Welsh Government Cathays Park Cardiff CF10 3NQ Dear Sir/ Madam, McDonald's response to the Consultation on proposals for an Environment Bill McDonald's is pleased to respond to Welsh Governmen t's consultation, Towards the sustainable management of Wales' Natural Resources: Consultation on proposals for an Environment Bill . As a modern, progressive restaurant company, we recognis e our responsibility to protect and preserve the environment - and we are determined to leverage our scale to maximise our positive impact on the environment. For example, last year we were the he adline sponsor of Keep Wales Tidy's inaugural 'Clea n Coasts Week'. Over 100 clean-up events took place a cross the Welsh coastline, and over 2,000 bags of rubbish and debris were collected from beaches and estuaries. We continue to sponsor the campaign in 2014. Over the course of 2013, we have been actively enga ging with SEPA (the Scottish Environment Protection Agency) on the Scottish Government's regulations on separate waste collections. Although we recognise there are significant differences between the two p roposals, our Scottish work, including extensive trialling, means we are well-placed to comment on t he application of waste separation legislation to o ur sector. Please find below our response to the consultation questions relevant to our business. If you require any more details, please do not hesi tate to get in touch. I would be happy to meet with you to discuss these matters further, and to provide yo u with further details of the trials we have implemented in Scotland and the conclusions we have drawn from them. Yours faithfully, Katie Parker Head of Environment McDonald's Restaurants Ltd 4 | P a g e 3. McDonald's responses to questions posed in Consultation on proposals for an Environment Bill Regulation of waste collection and segregation Q19. Do you agree that the level of segregation ask ed of individuals/businesses is acceptable? If no, please state why and an alternative. A19. We believe the proposals, as they apply to our sect or, are reasonable where the business handles/ controls the waste directly - i.e. what the quick-s ervice restaurant (QSR) sector calls 'back-of-house '. However, the QSR sector also includes areas where c onsumers dispose of their own waste - what the sector calls 'front-of-house'. Our work in Scotland has shown that while back-of-h ouse waste separation is achievable, a requirement to separate front-of-house waste is much more chall enging for our sector. Indeed, the results of our t rials to date suggest that, as things stand, meaningful c ustomer separation is virtually impossible. These t rials have not yet resulted in any recyclable material, a s contamination levels have consistently been too h igh. We would therefore be keen to understand as soon as possible if the regulations seek to include front- of- house waste, and if so, to engage in a dialogue abo ut how the requirement to separate might be feasibl y interpreted for the purposes of the sector, given t he stated objective is to increase recovery of wast e materials, and in light of the parallel drive to mi nimise contamination levels in waste streams. We would also appreciate clarification on the issue of the co-mingling of waste streams. We believe t hat, where the same quality of recyclate can be achieved , co-mingling is an appropriate solution from an environmental, economic and practical viewpoint. Q20. Are there any particular types or sizes of bus inesses where it would not be technically, environmentally or economically practicable to keep the 7 waste streams separate at source? If yes, please identify them and explain why. A20. As outlined above, on the evidence of our trials t o date in Scotland, we have come to believe that from a technical and economic perspective, it will be virtually impossible for the QSR sector to imple ment front-of-house separation of each of the individual waste streams that are relevant to our business (paper, card, plastic, and food). We would be more than happy to brief you on the results of our Scott ish trials to date, which clearly demonstrate the chall enges our sector faces, and to engage in a dialogue about the best way forward. With regards to back-of-house separation, again, we would appreciate clarification on the issue of the co- mingling of waste streams. Our restaurants deal i n very high volumes within small building footprint s, and where the quality of the recyclate is not compr omised, we believe co-mingling is an acceptable solution from an environmental perspective, while t aking into account the spatial realities of our restaurant environment. Q21. Do you agree with the materials that we propos e to ban from landfill or energy from waste facilities? Are there any other materials which sho uld be banned from landfill or energy from waste facilities? If yes, what are they, and why? A21. In terms of the materials specified, while we suppo rt the specification that uncontaminated paper and card, as opposed to all paper and card, should be banned from landfill or energy from waste facili ties where it is practical to source segregate, we would appreciate clarity on whether the ban on plastic i s also for uncontaminated material only. In general, we believe that the ban should only apply to materi als that it is practical to source separate - food wast e in packaging, for example, will provide practical difficulties when it comes to separation, and there fore should not be included in the ban. 5 | P a g e With regards to the proposal as a whole, we would e mphasise that the necessary infrastructure must be in place before these proposals take effect. There must be clear alternative disposal routes for waste that is not of a high enough quality to be recycled, yet must be diverted from landfill or energy from wast e facilities. Q22. Do you agree that developing guidance for acce ptable levels of contamination in residual waste for landfill/ incinerator operators and the regulat or is a workable approach? If no, what other approa ch could we adopt? A22. Yes, we support the development of guidance in thi s way, but again we stress the need for clear alternative disposal routes. Q25. Do you agree that lead in times for the propos als are reasonable? If no, what alternative lead in time would you suggest? A25. The viability of meeting the lead-in times proposed is subject to a number of factors: Clarification of the inclusion or otherwise of fron t-of-house operations within the scope of the proposals; this is crucial for our planning. If fro nt-of-house operations are included, we need as much lead-in time as possible. We are keen to meet with you to understand the expectations on this, and to discuss the feasibility of implementat ion within the timeframes, given the time and cost involved in implementing the necessary infrast ructure for customer separation. The necessary infrastructure being in place for was te that is not of a high enough quality to be recycled, yet must be diverted from landfill or ene rgy from waste facilities. Q26. Do you agree that NRW are the best placed orga nisation to regulate the duty to source segregated wastes? If no, please give the reason an d propose an alternative regulatory body. A26. Yes, we agree that NRW are the appropriate organisa tion to regulate in this area, and would welcome an early opportunity to meet with the relev ant point of contact at NRW to discuss how these proposals impact our sector. Q28. Do you have any comments on the impact of thes e proposals (for example, impacts on your organisation)? A28. As previously stated, the scale of the impact of th e proposals on our business and sector will depend on the inclusion or otherwise of front-of-house ope rations. From a front-of-house perspective, if included, the economic impact to our business would be significa nt. The consultation paper states that \"it is clearly u nderstood that there should not be additional burde ns on businesses at a time when conditions in the UK e conomy are putting businesses under severe trading pressure\". It goes on to state that, in terms of im pact, \"businesses generally will not be required to do much more than what many businesses are already doi ng in separating their wastes for collection\". Whil e we are prepared to invest in infrastructure and ini tiatives that improve our environmental practices, our concern is that, on the basis of trials to date, cu stomer separation will not yield any recyclable mat erial. At the same time it will impose costs on the busine ss in terms of capital expenditure (bin modificatio ns) and additional labour. This is a subject we would be happy to discuss further in person. From a back-of-house perspective, we would ask the Welsh Government to take into consideration the additional cost in terms of staff time if some elem ent of co-mingling - where it does not impact on th e recyclability of the material, is not considered ac ceptable.

The primary purpose of AONBs (and National Parks) is to conserve and enhance natural beauty. The l ower Wye Valley is renowned as one of the most attractive lowland landscapes in Britain, covering 32 6 km2 (128 sq miles) between Chepstow and Hereford. The Wye Valley AONB, designated in 1971, is unique in straddling the border between England and Wales an d incorporates parts of the counties of Herefordshire (46% of the AONB), Monmouthshire (36%) and Gloucestershire (18%). The lower Wye Valley is therefore both one of the 5 AONBs in Wales and one of the 3 4 AONBs in England. The Wye Valley AONB is managed by a Joint Advisory Committee (JAC). The JAC is a strong cross -border partnership of local authorities, government agencies and co -opted members consisting of interested local and national organisations. The JAC oversees the implementation of the statutory AONB Management Plan by the AONB Unit and other partners and advises on issues, policies and strategies. The AONB Unit also services a number of sub -groups and working groups of local experts and interested parties. The term Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation - Wye Valley AONB Partnership 3 'AONB Partnership' is used to refer to all the partners engaged directly in the management and governance of the AONB. Chapter 1 - Introduction 1.1 - 1.7 Supporting a more effective approach The Wye Valley AONB Partnership welcomes the intention to frame Wales' economic, environmental, and social decision making within the wider context of achieving a more sustainable way of living. We particularly welcome recognition of the value of Wales' natural resources and the interdependent nature of their relationships with each other and with social and economic factors. We also welcome the intention to simplify processes and plans . However , it should be recognised that environmental processes and plans exist to help manage the often complex, poorly understood and nuanced relationships with natural processes between natur al and human interaction. 1.8 - 1.17 Case for Change We broadly support the intention to address the issue of market failure around some environmental goods and services. However, we are concerned that there is confusion in 1.8 between the natural resources of Wales and the services they provide. We also would have expected to see some recognition, that provisioning and regulating services can be managed through the interplay of market forces, r egulation, and incentives, whereas cultural services cannot. Protected landscapes deliver a disproportionately high level of cultural services but mechanisms to value them, pay for them, and manage them are not discussed. C ultural services represent a si gnificant natural resource for Wales with important social and economic impacts. Greater emphasis should therefore be placed on these services currently subject to the impact of market failure, particularly if Wales is to fully utilise its natural resourc e capital effectively. Therefore we believe there is scope for Welsh Government to better articulate the relationship, and difference, between the natural resources of Wales and the services they provide. We particularly welcome the general point made in 1.13 on the need for a regulatory framework that allows for the integration of environmental, economic, and social considerations. However we are concerned that the underpinning role played by the natural environment in supporting the economy and societ y is missing from this paragraph. This leads to the impression that the proposals for regulation do not fully reflect the case for change set out earlier in the chapter. We object to the incorrect reference and interpretation of legislation in 1.14. rel ating to National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) . The founding legislation for these protected landscapes was the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 Act and this was enacted as a clear response to social need s, not ' in response to specific environmental problems '. The 1949 Act was inten ded to improve opportunities for Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation - Wye Valley AONB Partnership 4 recreation and access , which was, and still is, a positive economic driver. The phrase 'preservation' in the 1949 Act was replaced with 'conservat ion' through an amendment in the Countryside Act 1968. The term 'special qualities' exists in relation to the National Parks ' second purpose but it does not exist in relation to AONB designation , to which the legislation refers purely to 'natural beauty' . Citing an erroneous and out of date reference to the legislative framework for AONBs in the Case for Change is unhelpful . It is also exceedingly disappointing considering that our response to the 'Sustaining a Living Wales ' in May 2012 identified a simila r error. 1.18 - 1.26 The Role and Functions of Natural Resources Wales We support the concern raised by t he National Association for AONBs ( NAAONB ) that the purpose of Natural Resources Wales is open to interpretation and potentially inconsistent with t he stated commitment to achieving sustainability. 1.27 - 1.34 Legislative and Policy Context We welcome the clear link between the Environment Bill, the Future Generations Bill, and the Planning Reform Bill. However, it would be useful to see greater clarification over how these bills will interact and how delivery of the long term outcomes of the Future Generations Bill will be supported by the Environment Bill and the Planning Reform Bill, accepting that Town and Country planning is one of the main r egulatory and decision making mechanisms available to effect environmental change. We fully support the recognition, in paragraph 1.34, of the relationship between the natural and historic environment, particularly in relation to the term 'landscape' . We are keen, however, to stress the importance of retaining the term 'landscape' within the draft definition of natural resources in order to fully reflect the suite of Wales' natural resources. We fully support the consideration of landscape in an int egrated approach to natural resource management. We are particularly pleased to see reference to the term 'natural beauty'. Chapter 2 - Natural Resource Management Question 1 Do you agree with the overall package of proposals in relation to natural resource management in chapter 2? Yes Please provide comment: The Wye Valley AONB Partnership welcomes many of the proposals set out in Chapter 2. We support an area based approach to integrated natural resource management and agree that establishing a legal definition for natural resource management should be the first step. We particularly agr ee that any definition should clearly highlight the fact that natural resource management is more than exploitation for economic gain. There should also be specific reference to the word 'landscape ' with a clear understanding and interpretation of it as a Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation - Wye Valley AONB Partnership 5 valuable resource important to the ecosystem service approach as well as its significance in relation to our cultural heritage. The 'landscape ' approach is an effective mechanism to achieve integrated natural resource management. We would value clarity on the relationship between statutory AONB management plans and the natural resource management plan, and hope that this would encompass the role that the State of the AONB reports could make in providing a sound evidence base. We support the definition of sustainable management set out in 2.17 but we are not convinced that the statutory purpose of NRW , set out 1.24 , is aligned with this definition. This is a fundamental issue that needs to be addressed at this stage. We agree that the current system to protect, regulate, and manage the environment is complex . However we would like to emphasise that AONBs and National Parks are essentially enabling designations that work at a landscape scale and recognise environmental , social and economic constraints an d approach them in an integrating way. Recognition of this, and correction of the erroneous statement in 1.14, would deliver a true represent ation of services and opportunities the protected landscapes provide for Wales. Question 2 Do you agree with the approach to define natural resources, sustainable management of natural resources and integrated natural resource management in Wales? Yes Please provide comment: It is welcomed that 'Landscape' will be recognised as one of Wales' important natural resources and that its definition combines physical features of the natural environment, and cultural and historic influences - in line with the European Landscape Convention and Ecosystems Approach. Para 1.34 provides further specific headings for landscape including cultural heritage, sense of place and natural beauty, which help frame how landscape is perceived from a number of separate but related perspectives and allowing the conservation and desi gnation functions of Cadw and NRW to be reflected in the Bill. The definition of 'landscapes' also needs to be include 'seascape s'. Landscape Character Assessments also help to articulate the elements and features of an area which give it its specific character and sense of place. The l andscape approach can realise the opportunities for ecosystem delivery at a regional and local lev el and is also a useful context within which to spatially map and understand the compon ents of Green Infrastructure. It is felt that the White Paper is somewhat ambiguous on whether the ecosystem service approach in the Bill will utilise a landscape approa ch, or whether it will be based on biodiversity resilience. It is the latter that reads as the primary delivery vehicle for the fulfilment of the ecosystem approach. A landscape led approach would provide a n holistic framework to address social, economic a nd environmental issues which can focus on opportunities and benefits rather than just constraints , thus attracting jobs , funding Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation - Wye Valley AONB Partnership 6 and investment for a sustainable future. Question 3 Do you agree that climate resilience and climate change mitigation should be embedded into our proposed approach to integrated natural resource management at both national and local levels? Yes Please provide comment: The example s given in 2.28 & 2.29 focus on ecosystem habitats, but there are many more factors and services that should be referenced in such scenario ; such as how natural resources near settlements provide green infrastructure functions of improving air quality, reducing noise, surface run -off and flood management, moderating any heat island affect and creating quality spaces which people use to enhance their health and wellbeing. Question 4 Do you agree that the setting of na tional outcomes and priority actions for natural resource management should follow the five -year cycle for national outcome setting as proposed in the Future Generations Bill? Yes Please provide comment: It appears logi cal to relate natural resource management to the Future Generations Bill. It is essential that these outcomes are aligned with those in the Policy Statement for Protected Landscapes. However, ' national outcomes ' and priorities need to be set in ways that a re locally deliverable , but there may well be projects which , due to complexity and needing to test and define approaches (e.g. delivery of the water framework directive), cannot be conveniently aligned with this time frame. Question 5 Do you agree that the area -based approach will help provide a clear, prioritised and focussed approach to delivery? Yes Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation - Wye Valley AONB Partnership 7 Please provide comment: We welcome the inclusion of AONB Management Plans in 2.71. However, w e would like to draw attention to the Land Use Consultants report of 2009 *, which identified the correlation between ecosystem service delivery, their pressure s and risk s, and the protected landscapes (National Parks and A ONBs) ; effectively ecosystem hotspots . We are therefore surprised that not more is made of the potential value of the protected landscape s and their Management Plans in informing an area based approach to natural resource management. The identified correlation of AONB s (and National Park s) to the richness of ecosystem service provision provide s a useful case study for the potential of the area -based approach; with those designations having systems of management planning, partnership governance, the duty to have regard, management teams etc. and opportunities for delivering conserv ation / enhanc ement &/or restor ation of the functionality of ecosystems. We are unsure why, in Table (ii) , the 'National Park duty of regard ' (Environment Act 1995, s.62. ) is included but not the similar 'AONB duty of regard ' (Countryside & Rights of Way Act 2000, s.85 ). *Land Use and Environmental Services, Final Report to the Environment Agency, Project no. SC080014, July 2009 Question 6 Do you agree that the approach is flexible enough to enable significant elements of the plans for natural resource managemen t to be replaced in the future? Yes Please provide comment: Question 7 Do you agree with placing a requirement on other public bodies to co -oper ate in the area-based approach ? No Please provide comment: We are not convinced that this will be an effective or efficient tool, particularly as it is hard to see how this duty might apply to the private and third sectors , who are key players in achieving the desired outcomes. The requirement for a duty to co -operate will not guarantee co -Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation - Wye Valley AONB Partnership 8 operation. Co-operation and collaboration comes about as a r esult of agreed shared direction, not compliance with a duty. This may actually distract focus and resources away from development of co -operation into monitoring of the 'duty' and enforcement. It seems highly unlikely that any 'enforced co -operation' is going to be productive. True co -operation requires behavioural change, cross sectorial understanding, and an environment within which collaborative systems and processes can flourish. The AONB Family has worked hard to instil a culture of co -operation an d collaboration across its network s, and AONB partnerships continues to develop this area of work, expanding across the public, private and third sectors. This collective experience would make a valuable contribution to this area of thinking. Question 8 Do you agree that NRW should be the lead reporting authority for natural resources? Yes Please provide comment: Question 9 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals (for example, impacts on your organisation)? The Wye Valley AONB Partnership welcomes the recognition, in 2.89, of Cross -border issues . As a cross -border Protected Landscape partnership we are permanently engaged in cross border co-operation and collaborative landscape scale projects. It is essential that all parties to natural resource management in Wales understand that ecosystems and their services do not follow administrative boundaries. Therefore any resources, regulation or legislation must work effectively at a landscape, UK and European scale with counterparts, habitats a nd ecosystems across the border . Chapter 3 - Natural Resources Wales - new opportunities to deliver Question 10 Do you agree wi th the proposals set out in chapter 3 in relation to new ways of working for NRW? No Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation - Wye Valley AONB Partnership 9 Please provide comment: The Wye Valley AONB Partnership has significant concerns about the proposal to enable Welsh Ministers to make changes to primary legislation through secondary legislation , where this is needed to align NRW's duties with primary legislation. We do not believe that these powers are needed and we are concerned at the pr ecedent being set for amending primary legislation without adequate scrutiny. Similarly, as t here is no agreed 'definition for integrated natural resource management ', we do not support the proposal \"to enable Welsh Ministers to make specific changes to ex isting primary legislation, where it can be demonstrated that the current law is contrary to the definition, purpose and objectives of integrated natural resource management \". In addition, we are unclear how this proposal reflects the recommendations set out in The Welsh Government's Constitutional Affairs Committee Inquiry into the Drafting of Welsh Government Measures: Lessons from the first three years, February 2011. This would benefit from significant elaboration. However, we welcome the opportunity to refine NRW's purpose and to resolve the potential inconsistency in interpretation of the commitment to achieving sustainability , as opposed to 'sustainable use' , as outlined earlier and by the National Association for AONBs (NAAONB) . Within this NRW' s landscape function needs to be clearly set out. The White Paper defines landscape as including cultural heritage, sense of place and natural beauty. Th is recognition is welcomed as these elements of the landscape are important for sustainable resource management and economic, social and environmental reasons at both regional and local landscape scale s. They are championed within nationally designated areas , but are present in all landscapes, as recognised by the European Landscape Convention. Question 11 What limitations or safeguards on the use of powers might be necessary to enable NRW to trial innovative approaches to integrated natural resource management? No comment Question 12 Do you agree that NRW are an appropriate body to act as facilitators, brokers and accreditors of Payments for Ecosystem Services Schemes? Yes Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation - Wye Valley AONB Partnership 10 If 'yes' , do you consider that there is a need for any new powers to help to further opportunities for PES? The PES proposal could tie in very well with landscape approach, Green Infrastructure approach, and complement or supplement the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) funding pots for dedicated projects. Question 13 What should be the extent of NRW's power to enter into management agreements? No comment. Question 14 Recognising that there are some existing powers in this respect, where are the opportunities for General Binding Rules to be established beyond their existing scope? No comment Question 15 In relation to Welsh Ministers' amendment powers, do you support: a) the initial proposal to limit it to NRW's functions, subject to conditions as stated); or b) the additional proposal to cover broader environmental legislation, subject to conditions as stated? A B Please provide comment: We support neither. See response to Question 10 above. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation - Wye Valley AONB Partnership 11 Question 16 Please state any specific evidence of areas of potential conflict or barriers between the objectives of integrated natural resource management and the application of existing legislation. No comment Question 17 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals, for example, on your business or organisation? No. We are maki ng no comment on Questions 18 -41 Implementation / Equalities Question 4 1 We want to ensure that the Environment Bill is reflective of the needs of Welsh Citizen s. As such, we would appreciate any views in relation to any of the proposals in this White Paper that may have an impact on a) Human rights b) Welsh language or c) the protected characteristics as prescribed within the Equality Act 2010. These character istics include gender; age; religion; race; Pregnancy and Maternity; and, disability. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation - Wye Valley AONB Partnership 12 No comment Question 4 2 Do consultees have any other comments or useful information in relation to any of the proposals in this White Paper? No Gwarchod Bywyd Gwyllt ar gyfer y Dyfodol Protecting Wildlife for the Future The Environment Bill Team Climate Change and Natural Resource Policy Division Welsh Government Cathays Park Cardiff CF10 3NQ 15th January 2013 Dear Welsh Government Response to Wel sh Government White Paper consultation on proposals for an Environmen t (Wales) Bill Thank you for giving Wildlife Trusts Wales the opportunity to comment on the Environment (Wales) Bill. Our detail comments are contained within Appendix 1 but summarized below. There are areas we support in the White Paper such as the extension of the carrier bag levy to bags for life . We also welcome the ecosystems based approach and we hope that this consultation is the start of not just a legislative process but of joint delivery with the third, private and public sectors. However, there are significant areas of concern. We would like to see an overall vision for the Environment Bill along the lines of 'creating healthy , resilience ecosystems for current and future generations enabling them to live within environmental limits '. This would then flow from the Future Generations Bill. We object very strongly to NRM11, the proposal to enable Wel sh Ministers to amend primary legislation using secondary legislation . If used, this power wo uld reduce Assembly scrutiny of, and influence over , what could be significant changes to the legislative framework for environmental protection and management in Wales. We believe it would render the statute book in Wales less transparent and understandable. Both options proposed under NRM11 are incredibly broad (N RW's functions and powers come from approximately 230 pieces of primary legislation). We wholeheartedly reject the proposed licence to make incremental changes to Primary L egislation without proper scrutiny and consider this to be unconstitutional . Notwit hstanding the above, t he White Paper can be in places be quite generalist and theoretical. In fact, it appears to have more in common with a Green Paper rather than a White Paper . So we would recommend that the next step in developing this new and critical approach would be a Draft Environment Bill . This document should then give time for some more concrete and determined proposals for further consultation and scrutiny. We also have concerns with the proposals in the White Paper which place too much emphasis on the use of natural resources and not enough on their enhancement, protection and r esponsible stewardship . We are concerned also that without a clear remit for NRW to be an environmental champion there will be a lack of focus on enhancing biodiversity which in turn may lead to failure to achieve existing legislative commitments, e.g. Aic hi targets and climate change targets . This is vital because, in order to enable an ecosystems based approach , you have to ensure that biodiversity is protected and constantly enhanced as it underpins the entire process (as per Convention on Biological Div ersity). This is also paramount considering that when examining environmental limits we are already exceeding our planetary limits in terms of biodiversity. We note that protected sites are not specifically mentioned in the proposals . To undertake an Baltic House Mount Stuart Square Cardiff is a Registered Charity: a Company Limited Gwyllt ar gyfer y Dyfodol Protecting Wildlife for the Future ecosystem approach protected site management is vital to sustain the natural resource base. It is therefore disappointing this is not reflected in the content of the White Paper. A key test will be how the new emphasis on an ecosystem approach will influenc e over other processes and actors; e.g. Wel sh Government deployment of RDP funds; local plan allocations and specific decisions by Government, Local Authorities, public bodies and others. Whilst we wel come the involvement of NRW in Payment for Ecosystem S ervices (PES) schemes, we have reservations over NRW as PES broker. However, we welcome the proposal for NRW to enter into management agreements to get an agreed plan of interventions that are attached to land and create more natural solutions to flood ris k, etc. We also wel come the extension of the carrier bag levy to bags for life but would also recommend the direct channelling of revenue back into Wel sh charities to support delivery of environmental benefits for Wales. But we are concerned about the l ow importance within the document given to marine management . For example, there is no mention of how marine protected areas will help inform the Marine Plan. More detail is needed on how they intend to meet Good Ecological Status for MSFD or how area base d plans fit with marine planning and how collective pressure will be measured. We would like it noted that WTW wish to be involve d in the future development and operat ionalising these new frameworks such as National Resource Planning. Once again, thank you for the opportunity to comment on this document. Yours sincerely Rachel Sharp CEO, Wildlife Trusts Wales Gwarchod Bywyd Gwyllt ar gyfer y Dyfodol Protecting Wildlife for the Future APPENDIX 1 RESPONSE T O WEL SH GOVERNMENT WHITE PAPER CONSULTATION ON PROPOSALS FOR AN ENVIRONMENT (WALES) BILL Introduction Wildlife Trusts Wales (WTW) is the umbrella organisation for the six Wildlife Trusts in Wales - Brecknock, Gwent, Montgomeryshire, North Wales, Radnorsh ire and South and West Wales (hereafter referred to as the 'Wildlife Trusts') working together in partnership to achieve a common aims. The Wildlife Trusts collectively speak on behalf of more than 28,000 members and manage over 200 nature reserves, coveri ng more than 6,000 hectares of prime wildlife habitat, from rugged coastline to urban wildlife havens. Wildlife Trusts strive for a Living Landscapes and Living Seas , recognising this as an inspirational end point where our environment, society, and econ omy coexist for the benefit of wildlife and people. We want to foster the connectivity that links our urban and rural areas, our freshwater and coast, our land and sea. We aim, along with our partners, to create; ecologically functioning areas that can ad apt to climate change; providing resilience and connectivity for wildlife, access and enjoyment for people a population that is inspired by the natural world and value our environment for the many ways in which it supports our quality of life; a sustainab le, low carbon contribution to the economy; areas that provide a suite of essential ecosystem goods and services. Our interests therefore lie in people and communities, wildlife, and their interaction. We are at a pivotal moment. Unsustainable practic es have caused dramatic decline in habitats and species outside protected sites leading to the loss of ecosystem services over vast swathes of the Wel sh countryside. We would like to see an overall vision for the Environment Bill along the lines of 'creating healthy , resilience ecosystems for current and future generations enabling them to live within environmental limits '. This would then flow from the Future Generations Bill. WTW support s the overarching high -level ambition to develop and embed an ecosystem approach to management of the environment in Wales. We believe there is an urgent need to increase investment in restoring ecosystems through new approaches to enhance, protect and manage all elements of the natural and historic environment, both now and for future generations. The White Paper contains a number of concepts and proposals which continue to develop this vision and WTW support s and wel comes this work. We support the ecosystem s based approach has and we hope that this consultation is the start of not just a legislative process but of joint delivery with the environmental NGO (eNGO), privat e and public sectors. However, we do have concerns regarding proposals in the White Paper that place too much emphasis on the use of natural resources and not enough on their enhancement, protection and responsible stewardship . We would also like to emphasise that although new practices will be needed to adopt an ecosystems bas ed approach, we should not lose sight of the importance of using existing tools (e.g. site designations, other legislation) in delivering this approach. WTW wishes t o be involved in the futu re development and operationali sing of new frameworks, and believes that ensuring a strong purpose for Natural Resources Wales (NRW) to champion the protection and improvement of all elements of Wales' environment, land and seascap es, and to ensure a truly integrated appr oach to sustainable development, will be crucial to overall success . Absence of a clear remit for NRW to be an environmental champion may lead to a lack of focus on enhancing biodiversity for example, and this could result in failure to achieve ex isting legislative commitments (e.g. Aichi targets and climate change targets ) as wel l as a wider failure to live within environmental limits. We are sure this is not a situation that Government or anyone wish es to see , and i t is therefore crucial that the unique opportunity presented by the White Paper, to enable people to live within environmental limits, to Gwarchod Bywyd Gwyllt ar gyfer y Dyfodol Protecting Wildlife for the Future increase our resilience to climate change and to address the future needs of society in Wales , is fully harnessed . To do this we must ensure that appropriate focus and support is given to the positive measures available to protect and enhance our environment, as wel l as make sustainable use of its valuable natural resources for society and economy of Wales . We trust that Wel sh Government will be able to take our concerns and comments into account when analysing responses. As valued stakeholders we are anxious that our views are considered in the Governments' evaluation, and that effective mechanisms are in place for us to fully understand how our comments are taken into consideration as the process moves forward. Chapter 2: Natural Resource Management NRM 1 - Legal definition for natural resources We wel come the fact that Wel sh Government proposes to have clear definitions to assist in the development of the new approach. However, we note a number of omissions/ limitations with Governments' proposals. The definitions are extremely focused on natural resource use and neglect nature conservation, which, under the Convention of Biological Diversity1 (CBD) is fundamental to the ecosystem approach . This is a major omission. The concepts and principles of the CBD which themselves inform an ecosystem approach are not used directly by Welsh Government in their appraisal of natural resource definitions and their effects, nor in later sections describing the policies and priorities to implement integrated natur al resource management. We would like to highlight that delivering nature conservation and restoring degraded ecosystems is central to delivery of sustainable development. To enable an ecosystems based approach you have to ensure that biodiversity is prote cted and constantly enhanced as it underpins the entire process . In this way you achieve re -investment into the system therefore making the natural environment better enabled to deliver ecosystem services to meet the demands of our growing population and enable us to mitigate against o ur changing climate. The definition omits reference to living within environmental limits. We see this as a critical component and one that provides a link between the Environment and the Future Generations Bills. In addition, w e are disappoi nted that the terminology which is used does not reflect specific sustainable development language in relation to the needs of future generations. Instead the 'woolly' concept of \"environmental wellbeing\" is reintroduced, which can be misinterpreted legally as relating to human wellbeing only. We urge that this ambiguous language is replaced. We welcome that the collective actions refer to all public authorities and delivery bodies, not just NRW. However, we would welcome clarification as to how this with be monitored and reported on, ideally this should be through an independent body such as the Wales Audit Office to the Minister. Another omission from the definition of natural resources is seascapes. In general , there is a lack of reference in the proposals to seascap es and how marine issues will be incorporated into natural resource management planning. Some words in the definition , such as landscapes, need to be more clearly defined to ensure that they are not open to variable interpretations. The definition of lands capes set out in paragraph 1.34 should be used in the legal definition . NRM 2 - National natural resources policy and priorities This proposal presents an excellent opportunity to set out statutory targets relating to international targets to which Welsh Government is already committed on the key issues of climate change and biodiversity loss. These are two extremely challenging issues to tackle, and we believe statutory targets are needed to ensure commitment and to show clear lines of res ponsibility for our international commitments. Welsh Government's Climate Change strategy is not referenced in the White Paper and neither are the key emission reduction targets (3% per annum from 2011 and 40% total reduction by 2020 from 1990 baseline) no r the work of the Climate Change Commission for Wales (CCCW) and its sub -groups' Sectoral Adaption Plans (one of which is planned for the natural environment and land use). Instead the White Paper references the UK Climate Change Act (2008) and the adaptat ion reports required under this Act. This is a missed opportunity. 1 http://www.cbd.int/sp/ Gwarchod Bywyd Gwyllt ar gyfer y Dyfodol Protecting Wildlife for the Future The Welsh targets c ould be incorporated into the proposed National Nat ural Resource Management Policy, given statutory status in the Bill and delivered, in part at least, through the proposed natural resource area -based approach . We believe that a ddressing climate change through an Environment Bill should be about giving statutory recognition to the use of all Wel sh natural resources that have a bearing on both mitigation and adaptati on, and therefore effectively embedding the relevant parts of the Wel sh Government's Climate Change Strategy. We understand that the proposed approach draws on legislation that exists elsewhere, including in South Australia, and we note that the South Aust ralian Natural Resources Management Act includes in its objects the recognition of the intrinsic value of natural resources , protection of biological diversity and support for the restoration and rehabilitation of ecological systems2. We suggest that Wales should also recognise these elements of natural resource management. In point 2.22 it is stated that \"The Environment Bill will therefore provide the legislative basis for a national natural resources policy aligned to the national outcomes set out throug h the Future Generations Bill.\" We are still waiting to find out exactly what these will be, which makes it is difficult to comment with any certainty on this proposal. We would however, like to re -emphasise that national outcomes such as living within envi ronmental limits a nd using our fair share of the earth's resources in order to meet our needs, would be necessary to support the approach needed in the Environment Bill. In general the White Paper can be in places be quite generalist and theoretical. So we would recommend that the next step in developing this new and critical approach would be a Draft Environment Bill . This document should then give time for some more concrete and determined proposals for further consultation and scrutiny. NRM3 -6 - Establi shing and embedding natural resource management: development and priority setting of an area -based approach by NRW, a duty on other bodies to take the approach into account and reporting on progress The proposals outlined in NRM3 -6 are positive, however, m ore clarification is required before we are able to comment on their effectiveness in detail . One of the key benefits of the new approach should be that it enables NRW to deliver existing responsibilities more effectively including protected site condition, WFD and biodiversity targets, etc. However, we note that protected sites are not specifically mentioned in the proposals (except brief reference to MPAs) . It would be naive in the extreme to think that the new area -based framework would replace the need for all of the existing tools we have available to ensure protected site management as they remain vital to sustaining the natural resource base, and it is disappointing this is not reflected in the content of the White Pa per. It is extremely important that Government does not lose sight of existing targets, e.g. 2020 biodiversity target, as it works to develop these changes . The approach presents a real opportunity to build on existing tools and create exciting opportunit ies for what we call 'landscape scale conservation'. It is therefore essential that current mechanisms for delivering these priorities , are fully explored and integrated into the overarching approach the Government i s seeking to create. A key test will be how this process has influence over other processes and actors; e.g. Welsh Gover nment deployment of RDP funds; Local Plan allocations and specific decisions b y Government, local a uthorities, public bodies and others. The detail of how a duty for other bodies to take account of the area based approach and integrated natural resource management will operate, will be critical in ensuring that this process is cohesive and everyone works together to achieve nati onal priorities. From the content of the White Paper it is unclear what status these plans would have. Lessons should be learned from the experiences of the work undertaken on the Wales Spatial Plan. We welcome acknowledgement that the area -based approach for the sustainable management of natural resources is also appropriate in the marine environment and the importance of embedding any marine action within the evolving marine planning process. Marine planning provides the platform for an ecosystem -based approach to managing our marine waters and is a key tool for achieving the overarching target of Good Environmental Status by 2020 under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. An important component o f this area -based approach for the marine environment, and something that is not recognised in the consultation document, is the contribution that an ecologically coherent network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can make to EBM goals, specifically by redu cing the cumulative impacts of stressors on marine ecosystems. The recently published 'Wales Marine and Fisheries Gwyllt ar gyfer y for the Future sets out the Welsh Government's approach to implementing an ecosystem -based approach in the marine environment but the links to the wider natural resource management agenda need to be much more explicit. We welcome the recognition in paragraph 2.81 that non -monetised benefits need to be understood when analysing the evidence on natural resources as it is important to recog nise the benefits of a quality environment that cannot easily be quantified. We would also like to highlight the key role for the eNGO sector both in helping to develop natural resource management plans and in contributing to their delivery. In order to be able to fulfil this role effectively, eNGO sector organisations will need adequate resources. All partners, including those from the eNGO sector, should be involved at an early stage in the development of natural resource management plans. We need clarity on what status these plans will have , who will resource the process and implementation of them Chapter 3: Nat ural Resources Wales - New opportunities to deliver NRM 7 - Experimental powers for NRW Given th at Welsh Ministers will need to give formal approval to the terms of any scheme to be introduced, safeguards will need to be put in place to ensure the use of these new powers does not become too politicised. These should include ensuring that the process of developing and designing new schemes and seeking formal approval for them is undertaken in an open and transparent way with a clear mechanism for stakeholde rs to provide their own proposals for potential schemes as wel l as being consulted on NRW's proposals . There is a role for the third sector here in both engaging a wide range of stakeholders and providing expertise when co -producing schemes with local communities . In addition, there needs to be effe ctive assessment and reporting of the outcomes of those schemes that are introduced so that lessons can be learnt from the process. In particular there is a need to show how re-investment into the natural process is being achieved through monitoring against biodive rsity targets . NRM 8 - NRM and its role in development of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) We wel come development of Payment for Ecos ystem Services (PES) schemes, the important role for NRW and the exciting opportunities for involvement of environmental NGO and private sectors. We have reservations over NRW being broker whilst also establishing accreditation and assurance for schemes, as well as providing information and facilitation services, and its regulatory role. We suggest that it would be more appropriate for NRW to fulfil the l atter two of these roles . We would like to s ee the role of brokering agreements being with the third sector. We find it disappointing that there is no reference at this stage to working in partnership with the eNGO and the private sector . NRW cannot deliver an ecosystem based approach, nor can the third sector, we need to work together with the private business. NRM 9 - Management agreements We wel come this proposal for NRW to enter into management agreements to get an agreed plan of interventions that are attached to land and create more natural solutions to flood risk, etc. However, w e would like to emphasise how important it is that these agreements are attached to lan d holdings however, if they are not there is a danger that payments could become a commodity, as was the case with entitlement payments. How this process work s and how it would be resourced is unclear and although this level of detail is not needed at this stage, consideration must be given in case there is a legal requirement to enable these agreements. There is also a need for greater clarity as to whether NRW can require landowners to enter into management agreements. If so, how will this integrate with other agreement for land interventions such as measures under glastir. NRM 10 - New powers for the implementation of General Binding Rules WTW broadly we lcomes any initiative that seeks to remove duplication and improve efficiency of process through streamlining . However, this process needs to give full and detailed consideration to existing environmental requi rement such as SEA and Habitat Regulations. Therefore, NRW will need to ensure that this process is vigorous monitored and enforced. This will require new resources especially when applied in the marine environment. Gwarchod Bywyd Gwyllt ar gyfer y Dyfodol Protecting Wildlife for the Future NRM11 - Ministerial power to amend primary legislation via secondary legislation We object very strongly to NRM11, the proposal to enable Welsh Ministers to amend primary legislation using secondary legislation . If used, this power would reduce Assembly scrutiny of and influence over what could be significant changes to the legislative f ramework for environmental protection and management in Wales. We believe it would render the statute book in Wales less transparent and understandable . Both options proposed under NRM11 - (a) enabling Wel sh Ministers to amend primary legislation specific ally relating to NRW functions and powers, and (b) creating a broader power to amend environmental legislation - are incredibly broad (NRW's functions and powers come from approximately 230 pieces of primary legislation). The White Paper does not include specific examples of where this power needs to be applied because no specific examples have hitherto been identified by Wel sh Government. We believe that the need for change should be identified via a formal review process and, if this concludes that a change is needed; proposals for primary legislation should be published. We note that proposals in NRM11 go against Recommendations 2, 3 and 4 in the Consti tutional Affairs Committee report3, published in 2011 . We wholeheartedly reject the proposed licence to make incremental changes to Primary legislation without proper scrutiny and consider this to be unconstitutional . We have outlined our deep concerns regarding this proposal to the National Assembly's Environment and Sustainability Committee, and recomm ended that Government produce a D raft Bill to enable better understanding and scrutiny of the proposals. Resource Efficiency (Chapter 4) Regulatory Body (ies) for Waste Although NRW is the right body to enforce some of the changes / requirement s outlined in the White Paper, some support will also be required from local authorities and the eNGO s ector. For example, local authorities may be better able to undertake the regulation as part of their existing work, as is the current practise with reg ard to fly -tipping, where there was a Memo randum of Understanding between local a uthorities and t he Environment Agency about who would take responsibility, depending on the scale of the incident. Education campaigns can often be more successfully delivered by the eNGO s ector through their work on the ground with communities of place and interest. RE 6 & 7 - Carrier bag charges WTW has been a beneficiary of revenue as a result of the successful implementation of a single use carrier bag charge in Wales i.e. our partnership with the Co -operative F ood and Pharmacy stores . We have used this money to take forward crucial work in a range of areas of environmental improvement; work that serves to further mitigate the damaging environmental impa cts of single use carrier bags. We welcome the proposal to extend the carrier bag levy to bags for life . However, with regard to any revenue raised, we would recommend the direct channelling of revenue back into Welsh environmental charities to support the delivery of environmental and other social and economic benefits for Wales, rather than it being a requirement for retailers to pass on their net proceeds to any good causes. This would ensure that al l funds are used within Wales and that the Environment Bill is supporting the resourcing of natural resource management. Smarter Management (Chapter 5) SM 1 - Marine Licensing Management There is no mention of how marine protected areas (MPAs) will help inform the marine plan. More detail is also needed on how measures will work to meet Good Ecological Status for M arine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) . 3 National Assembly for Wales Constitutional Affairs Committee. (2011). Inquiry into the Drafting of Welsh Government Measures: Lessons from the first Bywyd Gwyllt ar gyfer y Dyfodol Protecting Wildlife for the Future Marine planning is intended to deliver the ecosystem approach, therefore we would seek clarification on how in -combination and cumulative pressures will be assessed , and if licenc es are granted what mitigation measures will be employed . We wel come the introduction of marine licensing pre -application fees (in line with the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) system) and would support the policy of full recovery costs . We support the 'subsistence charge' if this is invested into marine monitoring and research to provide a greater evidence base, to help with assessment of potential negative imp acts and their mitigation. We look forward to the opportunity to input into a separate full cons ultation on the proposed revisions to marine licensing and urge Government to ensure that any m easures within the forthcoming B ills are complimentary and compa tible. SM2 - Shellfishery Management The amendments to the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 appear to provide a mechanism for fuller consideration of activities within or without European Marine Sites (EMS). The opportunity to amend a submitted ma nagements plans at short notice , should the need arise to remove th e risk of damage to an EMS site , appears to embrace the precautionary principle and will help ensure compliance with conservation obligations such as the habitat regulations. In regards to the proposed measures to ensure compliance with management plans for several o rders, the White P aper refers to Part 8 of the Marine and Costal Access Act (MCAA). Part 8 MCAA, 238(3) (e) of MCAA notes that Byelaws are exempt from enforcement under MCAA. As Wales has inherited many byelaws from the Sea Fisheries Committees, and is currently reviewing and replacing all byelaws with Fisheries Orders under MCAA, it would therefore be pertinent to ensure that any existing byelaws exempt from enforcement powers , as proposed, are also addressed and replaced with a Fisheries Order. This will ensure a level playing field in regards to all future Several Order proposals in W elsh Waters. Whilst we welcome proposals for greater provision of enforcement to combat non-compliant damaging activities, we are aware that enforcement activities in Wales are at present not widely used. Therefore in recommending that greater enforcement duties be employed to ensure that several orders are compliant with conservation measures adj acent or within an EMS sites, we would welcome better use of existing enforcement measures, as necessary, across all areas of fishing.

Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 2 Environment Bill White Paper 23 October 2013 - 15 January 2014 Name Ben Underwood Organisation CLA Address Unit 8, Broadaxe Business Park, Presteigne, Powys LD8 2LA E-mail address ben.underwood@cla.org.uk Type (please select one from the following) Businesses Local Authorities/Community & Town Councils Government Agency/Other Public Sector Professional Bodies and Associations X Third sector (community groups, volunteers, self help groups, co -operatives, enterprises, religious, not for profit organisations) Academic bodies Member of the public Other (other groups not listed above) Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 3 Chapter 2 - Natural Resource Management Question 1 Do you agree with the overall package of proposals in relation to natural resource management in chapter 2? Yes x No Please provide comment: Firstly it is very encouraging that there a numerous references in the White Paper to the importance of managing the natural environment alongside social and economic considerations and that NRW, whilst undertaking its functions, must consider these factors equally. Question 2 Do you agree with the approach to define natural resources, sustainable management of natural resources and integrated natural resource management in Wales? Yes x No Please provide comment: In principle we agree with the approach. However , it is key to acknowledge that sustainable resource management cannot take place if those expected to deliver (landowners, farmers, foresters) do not have an economically viable business. If they don't , put quite simply, there will be no -one in rural Wales to deliver natural res ource management in the future. Integrated natural resource management is fine , but terminology surrounding the ecosystem approach is still not widely understood and certainly means nothing to practical land manage rs. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 4 Question 3 Do you agree that climate resilience and climate change mitigation should be embedded into our proposed approach to integrated natural resource management at both national and local levels? Yes x No Please provide comment: Question 4 Do you agree that the setting of national outcomes and priority actions for natural resource management should follow the five -year cycle for national outcome setting as proposed in the Future Generations Bill? Yes X No Please provide comment: National outcomes and priority actions for natural resource management are important to provide a coordinated approach and direction to activity on the ground. However , at all times due regard needs to be given to the fact that the natural environment is owned and managed, in the main, by private individuals and business es who need to take a longer term view on how they manage their land. The vast majority of landowners want to hand on to their successors an asset that is at least as economically, environmentally, and socially valuable as it was when they took it on and , thus they have a long term view which shouldn't be curtailed unnecessarily by setting short term outcomes. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 5 Question 5 Do you agree that the area -based approach will help provide a clear, prioritised and focussed approach to delivery? Yes x No Please provide comment: Yes, however we do have some concerns around the detail of the area -based approach. There is merit in identifying the opportunities, risks and challenges for the natural environment on a more localised basis; however , it cannot result in unnecessary restrictions on sustainable farming businesses and wider land management for commercial p urposes. The threat of 'lines on a map' are that it results in a postcode lottery of where you can and can't carry out certain land management activities which can impact on profitability of agricultur al land ultimately land values. The priorities and cha llenges in each area must be identified and discussed with full engagement of t hose who are actively managing land and running businesses in the vicinity. The relationship these area -based priorities will have on the planning system is unknown. The CLA would have grave concerns if this process hindered sustainable development in rural Wales. Question 6 Do you agree that the approach is flexible enough to enable significant elements of the plans for natural resource managemen t to be replaced in the future? Yes x No Please provide comment: Question 7 Do you agree with placing a requirement on oth er public bodies to co -oper ate in the area-based approach ? Yes x No Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 6 Please provide comment: The relationship these area -based priorities will have on the planning system is un known. The CLA would have grave concerns if this process hindered sustainable development in rural Wales. Question 8 Do you agree that NRW should be the lead reporting authority for natural resources? Yes x No Please provide comment: Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 7 Question 9 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals (for example, impacts on your organisation)? We have already mentioned our concerns about the postcode lottery effect and the impact on land management practices being displaced from one area to another. We have also highlighted our concerns about the impact the regional priorities may have on the pl anning system. Another note of caution of the area -based approach to managing natural resources would be the level of repetition in terms of stakeholder/interest group meetings between each area. More talk and less action would not be a welcome direction of travel. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 8 Chapter 3 - Natural Resources Wales - new opportunities to deliver Question 10 Do you agree with the proposals set out in chapter 3 in relation to new ways of working for NRW? Yes x No Please provide comment: Yes, subject to the specific caveats set out below. We are p articularly encouraged to see things moving forward regarding PES . Question 11 What limitations or safeguards on the use of powers might be necessary to enable NRW to trial innovative approaches to integrated natural resource management? We are strongly supportive of new approaches to sustainable land management, but we are concerned about the proposals for experimental powers. If they are drawn up with insufficient rigour or consideration for the needs of rural business es they run the risk of doing more harm than good. We suggest it would be more appropriate to consider what new approaches are required and then look and what additional powers are required to facilitate them. There can then be a proper level of informed dis cussion to establish the details of what is required. Trials on pri vate land would have to be safe guarded by an agreement that any land involved would not be 'locked down' in perpetuity. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 9 Question 12 Do you agree that NRW are an appropriate body to act as facilitators, brokers and accreditors of Payments for Ecosystem Services Schemes? Yes x No x If 'yes' , do you consider that there is a need for any new powers to help to further opportunities for PES? We are delighted that the Welsh Government and NRW intend to take such a proactive role in the development of m arkets for ecosystem services. We agree that NRW is an appropriate body to act as facilitator s, brokers and creditors. We would support the introduction of new powers necessary to facilitate these functions. The precise details of these new powers will, of course , depend on the model ad opted. In addition , we suggest that NRW be given the power to be a beneficiary or provider of last resort if, for some reason, the original beneficiar y or provider ceases to exist. The assumption is that the role would be transferred to an appropriate new beneficiary or provider as soon as one could be found. We note that the Law Commission has recently consulted on the need for legislative changes in this area, primarily conservation covenants. The issues raised in that consultation will also need consid eration. We emphasise that all these arrangements will only find favour with landowners if they enter into them voluntarily. Any system based on or involving the compulsory acquisition of land will be unacceptable to the vast majority of landowners. As su ch we see any sort of offsetting as being primarily a commercial matter with the landowner deciding that he wishes to dedicate his land for conservation purposes so long as the price is right. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 10 Question 13 What should be the extent of NRW' s power to enter into management agreements? We do not see a need for there to be any limit on the power to enter into management agreements so long as the agreements are consistent with NRW's powers. Moreover , they must be genuine agreements which the landowne r has entered into voluntarily. There c an be no element of compulsion. We concur that such agreements should be re gistered as local land charges. Question 14 Reco gnising that there are some existing powers in this respect, where are the opportunities for General Binding Rules to be established beyond their existing scope? We are opposed to the proposal regarding General Binding Rul es. NRW should not adopt them. The regulatory burden on rural businesses is already significant and in many cases has a tangible impact on profitability. However , these regulations are generally accepted by business because they are intended to deal with clear and identified risks of harm. To introduce what are essentially further regulations bringing an additional level of red tape to deal with the rather nebulous concept of best practice , rather than clear harm , is not justified and will not have the same level o f support. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 11 Question 15 In relation to Welsh Ministers' amendment powers, do you support: a) the initial proposal to limit it to NRW's functions, sub ject to conditions as stated); or b) the additional proposal to cover broader environmental legislation, subject to conditions as stated? A x B X Please provide comment: We are in favour of consolidating and clarifying the existing laws. We acc ept that the current situation is far to o complicated and cumbersome. However, we are concerned that the proposed mechanism for improving ma tters is sufficiently vigorous. We do not believe that simply consulting t he public and laying the draft O rder befor e the Welsh Government provides sufficient safeguards. There is too much of a risk that matters will not be properly scrutinised and that, in particular, implications for business will be missed. As such, there needs to be a specific process by which those with appropriate technical and practical expertise are engaged and obliged to comment. Question 16 Please state any specific evidence of areas of potential conflict or barriers between the objectives of integrated natural resource management and the application of existing legislation. We are not aware of any evidence. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 12 Question 17 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals, for example, on your business or organisation? We believe that most of what is proposed, particularly the proposals concerning the development of ma rkets for ecosystem services, has the potential to bring significant benefits for the natural environment of Wales and rural landowners. Nevertheless, we are concerned that the procedure for creat ing the necessary legislative framework is insufficiently robust to ensure that these markets deliver what is required . Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 13 Chapter 4 - Resource Efficiency Waste Segregation and Collection Question 18 Do you agree with the package of proposals in chapter 4 in relation to the regulation of waste segregation and approach of combining the 5 measures together? Yes No X Please provide comment: The waste segregation is too burdensome to small businesses. Are there any other materials or waste streams which should be included in the requirements to sort and separately collect? Yes No X If yes, what are they, and why should they be chosen? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 14 Question 19 Do you agree that the level of segregation asked of individuals / businesses is acceptable? Yes No X If no, please state why and an alternative. It is quite telling that the estimated costs of waste segregation to small businesses have not been calculated. The CLA fully support s recycling , however , the level of segregation that is being proposed could place a significant burden on small and medium businesses . Further investment into segregation at the waste facility sites would be more effective. Question 2 0 Are there any particular types or sizes of businesses where it would not be technically, environmentally or economically practicable to keep the 7 waste streams separate at source? Yes x No If yes, please identify them and explain why. The majority of small businesses throughout Wales, particu larly prevalent in rural Wales, would not be able to accommodate this. Certainly taking the CLA as a n example of a small business, w e work from a small light industrial unit , with little spare space and a level of waste disposal that would not justify the numerous bins and collection visits required. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 15 Question 2 1 Do you agree with the materials that we propose to ban from landfill or energy from waste facilities? Yes x No Are there any other materials which should be banned from landfill or energy from waste facilities? Yes No If yes, what are they? No comment . Question 2 2 Do you agree that developing guidance for acceptable levels of contamination in residual waste for landfill/ incinerator operators and the regulator is a workable approach? Yes x No If no, what other approach could we adopt? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 16 Question 2 3 Do you agree that there should be a prohibition on the disposal of food waste to sewer? Yes No If yes, should this apply to: a) Households b) Businesses and Public Sector c) Both Please provide comment: No comment . Question 2 4 Do you have any comments about how such a prohibition should be enforced with i) businesses and public sector and ii) households? i) No comment ii) Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 17 Question 2 5 Do you agree that lead in times for the proposals are reasonable? Yes No If no, what alternative lead in time would you suggest? No comment . Question 2 6 Do you agree that NRW are the best placed organisation to regulate the duty to source segregated wastes? If no, please give the reason and propose an alternative regulatory body. Yes No No comment . Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 18 Question 27 In your opinion, who is the most appropriate body to regulate the bans on disposal of food waste to sewer for businesses and the public sector: NRW x Local Authorities Sewerage undertaker or Other If 'Other' please propose an alternativ e regulatory body and state reasons: Question 2 8 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals (for example, impacts on your organisation)? No comment . Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 19 Carrier Bags Question 29 Do you agree with the proposal to extend the enabling powers of the Welsh Ministers so that they may, by regulations, provide for minimum charges to be set for other types of carrier bags in addition to single use carrier bags? Yes No Please provide comment No comment . Question 3 0 Do you agree with the proposal to extend the enabling powers of the Welsh Ministers so that they may, by regulations, require retailers to pass on their net proceeds to any good causes? Yes No Please provide comment No comment . Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 20 Question 3 1 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals (for example, impacts on your organisation)? No comment . Chapter 5 - Smarter Management Marine Licensing Management Question 3 2 Do you agree with the proposals in relation to Marine Licensing? Yes No Please provide comment No comment . Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 21 Question 3 3 Do you have any comments on whether the Welsh Government should extend NRW' s ability to recover costs associated with marine licensing by charging fees for: - pre-application costs? - variation costs? - costs of transferring of licenses? - covering regulatory costs, via subsistence changes? No comment . Question 3 4 Do you have any comments relating to the impact of the proposals? No comment . Shellfisheries Management Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 22 Question 3 5 Do you agree with the proposal in relation to Shellfishery Orders? Yes No Please provide comment No comment . Question 3 6 Are there any other changes to the Several and Regulating Order regime that you think should be considered (i.e. can you think of any other ways that current practices could be improved)? Yes No Please provide comment No comment . Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 23 Question 3 7 Do you have any comments on the impact of this proposal (for example, impacts on your business)? No comment . Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 24 Land Drainage Management / Flood and Water Management Question 3 8 Do you agree with the proposal in relation to changes to Section 29 of the Land Drainage Act (1991)? Yes X No Please provide comment Yes, this seems a sensible proposal . Question 39 Do you agree with the proposal in relation to changes to Section 47 of the Flood and Water Management Act (2010)? Yes X No Please provide comment Yes, these mirror the provisions for England . Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 25 Question 4 0 Do you have any comments on the impac t of either of these proposals? No. Implementation / Equalities Question 4 1 We want to ensure that the Environment Bill is reflective of the needs of Welsh Citizens. As such , we would appreciate any views in relation to any of the proposals in this White Paper that may have an impact on a) Human rights b) Welsh language or c) the protected characteristics as prescribed within the Equality Act 2010. These characteristics incl ude gender; age; religion; race; Pregnancy and Maternity; and, disability. No comment . Question 4 2 Do consultees have any other comments or useful information in relation to any of the proposals in this White Paper? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 26 The CLA has been developing thinking on PES for many years now and would be happy to discuss this further.

Does dim digon o d data nag tystiolaeth i weld yn union beth fydd yn bwysig i n i gyfer chanolbwynti ar y ddidoli a chasglu ar wah\u00e2n? Oes Nac oes Os oes, ffrwd wastraff gwahanol y y Papur Gwyn hwn? Dear Sir/Madam, Please see below our response to the Consultation on the Environment Bill White Paper. Response from SDCC Executive The white paper emphasises the strong link between sustainability and natural resource management. In its simplest terms the proposed approach to Natural Resource Management (based on ecosystem services) - if it gets it right - will help us consider the real value of our natural resources and will support us in making good decisions now and that won't cause problems for future generations down the line. This will support the policy ambitions of Wales in relation to Sustainable Development - in particular the upcoming Future Generations Bill - and the linkage to making sustainable development the central organising principle of all public sector bodies, which includes Natural Resources Wales. We would however like to see more detail as to how these upcoming Bills (Environment Bill, Future Generations Bill and the Planning Bill) will link together to support each other. We believe that it makes sense to use the governance structures of the FG Bill - especially as it is to make sustainable development the central organising principle of public sector bodies. If a holistic approach is to be taken of the environment in the Bill then there is no mention of either living within environmental limits or the precautionary principle to resource management and use. We also think that it is important to put emphasis on the underpinning role that biodiversity has in supporting the services provided by natural resources.

Unit 5, Triangle Business Park, Pentrebach, Environment Bill -White Paper The CIWM Cymru Wales Centre held a workshop last 6th December 2013 at which the resource efficiency proposals for Waste were discussed and the results of the discussion below have been added to b y further information from members who did not attend this discussion which have been placed in the consultation paper response form below. Note: For information, we are providing the list of delegates who attended our workshop (page 4 of this response ). A- Results of discussions at the workshop: Duty on non-domestic waste producers to source segregate paper, card, plastic, metal, glass, food & wood - 2017 Need phased introduction - larger businesses first Market development - particularly for plastic and wood. Greater reprocessing capacity in Wales Thresholds - quantities of target materials produced Active engagement of businesses prior to implementation Additional resources re regulation Extension of current 2015 separate waste collection requirement for paper, plastic, metal and glass to include card, wood & food - 2017 Clarify what wastes are covered - household? C&D? Remove responsibility from Las to collect commercial waste What is the definition of source-segregated? What does it mean for small producers? End markets need to be developed - particularly wood TEEP guidance needed If no commercial collections, will duty fall to LAs to provide services Cuts to LA sustainable waste management grant - but asked to do more Cost benefit analysis of proposals needed - need to be able to see complete picture to be better informed Too much regulation - add costs to LAs and businesses Communal collection facilities - e.g. Trade waste bring sites - is this classed as separate collection? Needs to consider service availability in rural areas Ill-conceived, ill-thought, poorly written! Will there be a deminimis level that will be exempt from source segregation? Tolerance for quality/ contamination levels? Landfill and EfW bans for paper, card, plastic, metal, glass, food & wood - 2017 Landfill Bans: oLandfill tax already driving materials away oBan organics makes future landfill mining more viable oEnsure landfill tax continues to work oCollections systems/ quality is EFW bans: oHow to cost/ bureaucracy2 o EfW plants require volume/ calorific values o Ban discourages investment in EFW o What penalties for non -compliance o Is this counter to TZW policy o If not in Wales, where will it go? o Does it apply to export? o Some sort of tax/ financial driver as an alternative to a ban Ban on disposal of food waste to sewer - business premises - 2017 Maceration Need to explain why this is important How many businesses have them? Limit to larger business premises What support for business on the additional cost of collections? Issues with additional storage Issues with frequency of collection Positive impact on food waste reduction Should it be in building regs? From 2017 not allowed to be installed... Unnecessary r egulation? What would the impact be? Water companies should be part of the regulation Fees for macerators? Hard to regulate - macerator police! Effective monitoring - e.g. pretreatment Cost -benefit analysis If the sewage treatment plants have AD is this n ot an effective treatment method? Extra environmental impact of collection in rural areas Waste cooking oil a separate issue? Oil in households more of an issue in households than in business potentially.

Yes No Please provide comment: We appreciate that the proposals to further improve waste segregation may create opportunities for enduring and high quality business oppor tunities and jobs which support enterprise and promotion of the circular economy and green growth agenda. But the relationship of this aspect of the white paper with the fact that waste issues do not apparently clearly fall within the natural resources and the natural resources management definitions within the draft bill. This will result in conflict within NRW to resource the waste related elements of the bill (in terms of finance and staff work preferences) alongside the natural resources management ap proach which clearly encompasses the majority of the other work of the Natural Resources Wales body. Where work on wastes directly impacts natural resources through pollution of water, land or air in Wales it would clearly fall within the scope of natural resources and natural resources definitions but the environmental benefits of improving waste segregation, recycling and the other waste proposals within this bill would not have a direct impact on natural resources within Wales and would not clearly sit w ithin the major thrust of NRW's work. This is a major disconnect within NRW and will be to the detriment of NRWs delivery of this additional work on waste, it would be better if WG could incorporate the necessary work on waste and resource efficiency clear ly within the definition of natural resources or natural resource management. It might be helpful if these definitions aligned with the definition within the EU resource efficiency strategy \"Natural resources underpin the functioning of the European and gl obal economy and our quality of life. These resources include raw materials such as fuels, minerals and metals but also food, soil, water, air, biomass and ecosystems.\" The natural resource management policy statement does make the links between natural r esources, green growth, sustainable use of resources, and sustainable management of waste clear, but these are not explicitly visible in the definitions section of the environment bill white paper. The absence of consideration of waste management as part of the process contributing towards sustainable use of natural resources is illustrated by the absence of regional waste plans within the illustrative list of plans in table (ii). Question 2 Do you agree with the approach to define natural resources, s ustainable management of natural resources and integrated natural resource management in Wales? Yes No 6 Please provide comment: The common English language definition that refers to materials or substances that occur in nature that can be exploited for economic gain, does not cover the important elements of natural resources and their management, p articularly with regard to the sustainability aims and objectives of the Welsh Government. It fails to consider the environmental, economic and social ramifications related to it. Nor does it cover the management of resources which may be derived from nat ural resources but in other geographic parts of the world and are imported into Wales for use and eventually disposal, clarification of the definitions in this draft act or modification of the definitions to encompass the management of resources that are i n Wales whether they are derived from indigenous natural resources or not. Question 3 Do you agree that climate resilience and climate change mitigation should be embedded into our proposed approach to integrated natural resource management at both nat ional and local levels? Yes No Please provide comment: / Question 4 Do you agree that the setting of national outcomes and priority actions for natural resource management should follow the five -year cycle for national outcome setting as proposed in the Future Generations Bill? Yes No Please provide comment: The five -year cycle will allow for the changing local and national contexts to be reported and consequently priorities and issues can be identified and readdressed on a regular basis. This seems particularly beneficia l for both Macro and Micro levels, national and local levels respectively for all to keep up with. This will only be a success if all organisations that are involved with natural resources and their management report back to Natural Resources Wales in a co nsistent manner Question 5 Do you agree that the area -based approach will help provide a clear, prioritised and focussed approach to delivery? Yes No 7 Please provide comment: Yes and No, as it will vary by each individual topic and/or issue. Certain issues and monitoring will need t o be pan Wales, UK, or the EU in order to contribute to the improvement. An area based approach appears to be the mos t effective approach to delivery, although a true reflective answer is difficult to provide as the definition of the boundaries that this new area based approach will work towards has not been established and is not provided. The area boundaries need to no t only reflect natural systems but also administrative geographies. It appears that it will be beneficial, as ecology does not respect boundaries and it will allow organisations to contribute towards issues at a local level rather than contributing to the national level. Although it is important that regular reporting occurs in order to ensure that priorities in the national interest are also established and achieved. Question 6 Do you agree that the approach is flexible enough to enable significant el ements of the plans for natural resource managemen t to be replaced in the future? Yes No Please provide comment: There is not enough information provided to answer the question, as there is limited detail of the additional proposed Bill's that the Environment Bill will work in conjunction with, such as the Planning Reform Bill and th e Future Generations Bill. Question 7 Do you agree with placing a requirement on other public bodies to co -oper ate in the area-based approach? Yes No Please provide comment: Without a joined up cooperative approach it seems that this new Envir onment Bill will fail, as it relies upon a number of parties and stakeholders involvement. It could potentially lead to one or two individuals undermining the whole group's efforts. For example if certain organisations or bodies do not cooperate with other s it will detrimentally effect information reporting and sharing of practice, and consequently the area as a whole. Private sector bodies should also be encouraged to co -operate as they also have potential to assist with the process. 8 Question 8 Do you agree that NRW should be the lead reporting authority for natural resources? Yes No Please provide comment: / Question 9 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals (for example, impacts on your organisation)? / Chapt er 3 - Natural Resources Wales - new opportunities to deliver Question 10 Do you agree with the proposals set out in chapter 3 in relation to new ways of working for NRW? Yes No Please provide comment: No comment. Question 11 What limitations or sa feguards on the use of powers might be necessary to enable NRW to trial innovative approaches to integrated natural resource management? No comment. 9 Question 12 Do you agree that NRW are an appropriate body to act as facilitators, brokers and accreditors of Payments for Ecosystem Services Schemes? Yes No If 'yes', do you consider that there is a need for any new powers to help to further opportunities for PES? No comment. Question 13 What should be the extent of NRW's power to enter into management agreements? No comment. Question 14 Recognising t hat there are some existing powers in this respect, where are the opportunities for General Binding Rules to be established beyond their existing scope? No comment. Question 15 In relation to Welsh Ministers' amendment powers, do you support: a) the init ial proposal to limit it to NRW's functions, subject to conditions as stated); or b) the additional proposal to cover broader environmental legislation, subject to conditions as stated? A B Please provide comment: No comment. 10 Question 16 Please state any specific evidence of areas of potential conflict or barriers between the objectives of integrated natural resource management and the application of existing legislation. No comment. Questi on 17 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals, for example, on your business or organisation? No comment. Chapter 4 - Resource Efficiency Waste Segregation and Collection Question 18 Do you agree with the package of proposals in cha pter 4 in relation to the regulation of waste segregation and approach of combining the 5 measures together? Yes No Please provide comment: The joined up approach to solid waste streams is entirely reasonable but the change required for contractors and waste producers is both significant and open to different interpretations. Without clear guidance and a phas ed approach there is the risk that the regulations will become meaningless, as those potentially impacted look for loopholes to avoid an impractical level of cultural change within the workplace. In Scotland similar regulations for segregation that were m eant to take full effect on 1st January 2014 appear likely to be implemented over a much longer period, with the risk that they won't be taken seriously. Contractors and collection authorities have different views of what 'separate collection' means, wast e producers are not fully aware of the implications and the resourcing and timing of the change does not allow for the industry to respond as comprehensively as the regulations require. For instance the large scale supply of recycling bins needs several months' notice, but local authorities and commercial contractors did not have a deadline for placing orders for bins, and would not have been able to risk ordering on spec. If the regulations in Wales are to be more effective they should: avoid 1st Janua ry as an operational deadline - Christmas is the worst time of year for most businesses to introduce changes - maybe 1st January for putting a plan together 11 but the start of the financial year in April for implementation phase the requirements in over at l east a year, starting with larger businesses and/or sites, in order to avoid a single deadline for everyone and to increase awareness for SMEs before they are required to act consider a generic communication campaign supported by generic collection contain ers, in order to support the change and to plan container supply well in advance - for a business with multiple sites in Wales there is a strong disincentive to contract local authorities with differing systems, they would need a more joined -up offering to compete on a level playing field with private contractors However i t is worrying that WG can consider any additional burdens on LA's in the current economic climate. Welsh Local Authorities already have a statutory obligation to achieve Recycling and Com posting Targets by 2025, in order for this to be achieved greater extraction of materials from the residual waste stream will be required; it is likely this will include further segregation of material streams. By placing a further obligation on the autho rities as waste collectors there is duplication of the requirements and potential for contradiction. With regards to the timing of the proposed measures clear Recycling and Composting Targets are already set out with key milestones for their achievement . With the target of 70% being in year 2025 and local authority waste strategies established around this framework, it appears contrary to introduce an additional obligation for the separation of recyclates potentially from 2017. LA's will strive to cont inue to provide their current front line services despite significant cuts in sustainable waste management grant and even greater cuts in core budgets. Whilst we would all accept the environmental benefits of additional recycling these often come at a cos t and in the current economic climate consideration should be given to suspending SRT's (if there is an economic case to do so) so we can divert our remaining resources into other essential front line services. Are there any other materials or waste streams which should be included in the requirements to sort and separately collect? Yes No If yes, what are they, and why should they be chosen? The rationale being suggested that there will be very little or no additional cost in collecting the additional range of materials is difficult to understand.. The majority of collectors are a lready constrained by capacity on their vehicles and any additional pressure around the margins would result in significant additional collection costs. It is also confusing as it suggests the obligation to sort should rest with the producer but then sugge sts a joint responsibility for ensuring compliant with the Waste to Energy/Disposal Facility and the person delivering. There is also of course an issue with many MRF's not dealing with the additional waste streams and with LA's that often source segregate d service perhaps not having capacity to deal with these materials at their existing premises. Question 19 Do you agree that the level of segregation asked of individuals / businesses is acceptable? 12 Yes No If no, please state why and an alterna tive. If the target is to genuinely increase recycling the initial requirement should allow an opt -out for segregation of materials that arise in small volumes. It is not practical to expect businesses that in many cases carry out no waste segregation to instantly move to a system which covers all these materials. They may not have the space to collect and store separate materials and will not have the experience to effectively communicate the requirements to all employees and visitors. In some cases two -stream segregation would be the optimum short term change using a co -mingled approach rather than a full source segregation approach . The requirement to segregate is fine (as long as it does not place an additional burden on the business as suggested in the report) but some local authorities feel that the requirement to collect should be removed from LA's . Question 2 0 Are there any particular types or sizes of businesses where it would not be technically, environmentally or economically practicable to keep the 7 waste streams separate at source? Yes No If yes, please identify them and explain why. Businesses do not always have the internal or external storage space for multiple rigid containers, but could move in the right direction by tar geting one material or mixed stream. It would be better to get a realistic commitment to separate out paper in a small office for instance than the forced inclusion of a lot of materials that contaminate paper. For areas where employees eat and drink, fo r instance at the back of a shop, the work space is not always sufficient for segregation of all the different packaging types generated, and a Dry Mixed Recycling bin would be better than an unrealistic attempt to introduce four or five different bins. A test might be whether the business is capturing at least 50% of the volume of its waste for recycling (this is easier to estimate than weight). There are many small businesses (particularly shops) where waste storage and containment is a big problem and c onsideration should therefore be given to a \"de minimis\" level below which a duty to segregate does not apply. For example: Business with a turnover of under \u00a31,000,000 or those who produce less than 1 tonne of waste per week. But it is recognised that w eekly collection of recyclates could be delivered by a comingled recyclate collection. Question 2 1 Do you agree with the materials that we propose to ban from landfill or energy from waste facilities? Yes No 13 Are there any other materials wh ich should be banned from landfill or energy from waste facilities? Yes No If yes, what are they? It is virtually impossible to get all residents on board with what they should be recycling now and it will be impossibl e to determine who is contaminating and then when it exceeds some notional 'contamination level' who will end up paying the penalties? Local authorities would be reassured by confirmation from Welsh Government that there would be no impact on Government sp onsored waste management projects . Where agreed gate fee (and all other aspects of the contract) would remain unchanged. However, if guidance is produced it should include on explict assumption that residual waste from a well performing kerbside collection system w ould not contain valuable recyclables. Question 2 2 Do you agree that developing guidance for accep table levels of contamination in residual waste for landfill/ incinerator operators and the regulator is a workable approach? Yes No If no, what other approach could we adopt? This proposal potentially penalises organisations who have limited or no control over the quality of the products they receive and is likely to be impossible to enforce and administer. Where energy from waste c ontracts have already been agreed there was no mention of 'contamination limits' or the types of materials that should not be treated via Waste to Energy or landfilled so any additional cost w ould presumably pass to LA's or other waste collectors . Question 2 3 Do you agree that there should be a prohibition on the disposal of food waste to sewer? Yes No If yes, should this apply to: a) Households b) Businesses and Public Sector c) Both 14 Please provide comment: Why not just ban the fitting of these devices to new properties (regulated by Building Regulations) and ban the sale of such items in the UK. Question 24 Do you have any comments about how such a prohibition should be enforced with i) businesses and public sector and ii) households? i) Building Control/Building Regulations. ii) Building Control/Building Regulations. Question 25 Do you agree that lead in times for the proposals are reasonable? Yes No If no, what alternative lead in time would you suggest? No comment. Question 26 Do you agree that NRW are the best placed organisation to regulate the duty to source segregated wastes? If no, please give the reason and propose an alternative regulatory body. Yes No No comment. 15 Question 27 In your opinion, who is the most appropriate body to regulate the bans on disposal of food waste to sewer for businesses and the public sector: NRW Local Authorities Sewerage undertaker or Other If 'Other' please propose an alternative regulatory body and state reasons: Though Building regulations for new developments . Question 28 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals (for example, impacts on your organisation)? No comment. Carrier Bags Question 29 Do you agree with the proposal to extend the enabling powers of the Welsh Ministers so that they may, by regulations, provide for minimum charges to be set for other types of carrier bags in addition to single use carrier bags? Yes No Please provide comment No comment.

Chapter 5 - Smarter Management Marine Licensing Management Question 32 Do you agree with the proposals in relation to Marine Licensing? Yes No Please provide comment No comment. Question 33 Do you have any comments on whether the Welsh Government should extend NRW's ability to recover costs associated with marine licensing by charging fees for: - pre-application costs? - variation costs? - costs o f transferring of licenses? - covering regulatory costs, via subsistence changes? No comment. Question 34 Do you have any comments relating to the impact of the proposals? No comment. 17 Shellfisheries Management Question 35 Do you agree with the proposal in rela tion to Shellfishery Orders? Yes No Please provide comment No comment. Question 36 Are there any other changes to the Several and Regulating Order regime that you think should be considered (i.e. can you think of any other ways that current practices could be improved)? Yes No Please provide comment No comment. Question 37 Do you have any comments on the impact of this proposal (for example, impacts on your business)? No comment. Land Drainage Management / Flood and Water Management Question 3 8 Do you agree with the proposal in relation to changes to Section 29 of the Land Drainage Act (1991)? Yes No 18 Please provide comment No comment. Question 39 Do you agree with the proposal in relation to changes to Section 47 of the Flood and Water Management Act (2010)? Yes No Please provide comment No comment. Question 40 Do you have any comments on the impa ct of either of these proposals? No comment.

Question 42 Do consultees have any other comments or useful information in relation to any of the proposals in this White Paper? No comment. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 1 Towards the Sustainable Management of Wales' Natural Resources Environment Bill White Paper - Consultat ion Responses We want your views on our proposals for an Environment Bill. Your views are important . We believe the new legislation will make a difference to people's lives. This White Paper is open for public consultation and we welc ome your comments. The consultation will close on 15 January 2014. To help record and analyse the responses, please structure your comments around the following questions. You do not need to comment on all questions. The Welsh Government will run a series of engagement events across Wales on the White Paper during the consultation period. Please submit your comments by 15 January 2014. If you have any queries on this consultation, please e mail: NaturalResourceManagement@Wales.gsi.gov.uk Data Protection Any response you send us will be seen in full by Welsh Government staff dealing with the issues which this consultation is about. It may also be seen by other Welsh Government staff to help them plan future consultations. The Welsh Government intends to publi sh a summary of the responses to this document. We may also publish responses in full. Normally, the name and address (or part of the address) of the person or organisation who sent the response are published with the response. This helps to show that the consultation was carried out properly. If you do not want your name or address published, please tick the box below. We will then blank them out. Names or addresses we blank out might still get published later, though we do not think this would happen ver y often. The Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 allow the public to ask to see information held by many public bodies, including the Welsh Government. This includes information which has not been published. However, the law also allows us to withhold information in some circumstances. If anyone asks to see information we have withheld, we will have to decide whether to release it or not. If someone has asked for their name and address not to be published, tha t is an important fact we would take into account. However, there might sometimes be important reasons why we would have to reveal someone's name and address, even though they have asked for them not to be published. We would get in touch with the person a nd ask their views before we finally decided to reveal the information.

Yes No x Please provide comment: As specialists with knowl edge of and interest in the historic environment and historic landscapes we are concerned that t he overall package of proposals will not improve the tools to promote these aspects of the environment. Whilst there is acknowledgment in 1.34 that 'the natura l and historic environments are inextricably intertwined and shape the character of the Welsh landscape', there are no specific mechanisms identified for integrating the historic environment in decision -making. We do not think the inclusion of landscapes in the definition of the natural environment is sufficient to ensure that 'cultural heritage, sense of place and natural beauty shaped by man -made influences' is considered as part of an integrated approach. By histor ic environment we mean: historic landscapes, including those of the Register of Outstanding Landscapes of Historic Interest and Special Landscapes of Historic Interest, Parks and Gardens, Scheduled Ancient Monuments (SAMs) and their setting, Historic Envir onment Features (HEFs) and their settings, and other archaeological and historical sites recorded in the Regional Historic Environment Records (HERs). Sites and their settings are an integral part of the historic landscape, and the development of landscap es over time is a product of both cultural and natural heritage. The three bodies that have been amalgamated to form Natur al Resources Wales (NRW) each had different protocols for incorporating historic environment expertise into their work programmes; t he creation of NRW represents an opportunity to develop a coherent and consistent approach to the Welsh landscape. Without one, we believe that there is significant risk of serious and needless damage to its historic character. We welcome the focus in 1.35 on the importance of recognising 'the connections between social justice, economic prosperity and the use of natural resources, for current and future generations', and would like to emphasise how the current landscape is a product of these connections in the past. Understanding this and how it shapes future decisions is an integral part of its value. Question 2 Do you agree with the approach to define natural resources, sustainable management of natural resources and integrated natural resource management in Wales? Yes x No Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 4 Please provide comment: Question 3 Do you agree that climate resilience and climate change mitigation should be embedded into our proposed approach to integrated natural resource management at both national and local levels? Yes x No Please provide comment: Question 4 Do you agree that the setting of national outcomes and priority actions for natural resource management should follow the five -year cycle for national outcome setting as proposed in the Future Generations Bill? Yes x No Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 5 Please provide comment: Question 5 Do you agree that the area -based approach will help provide a clear, prioritised and focussed approach to delivery? Yes No x Please provide comment: It has the potential to do so, but will only work if there is good identification of and collaboration between all relevant stakeholders. Defining areas will be critical and may be easier to achieve in some areas than others. It will be easiest where topographically coherent areas coincide with political po lities. Some AONBs have governance structures that integrate historic environment expertise, others do not. Question 6 Do you agree that the approach is flexible enough to enable significant elements of the plans for natural resource managemen t to be replaced in the future? Yes No Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 6 Please provide comment: Question 7 Do you agree with placing a requirement on other public bodies to co -oper ate in the area-based approach ? Yes x No Please provide comment: It would be helpful to define what good co -operation would comprise. Question 8 Do you agree that NRW should be the lead reporting authority for natural resources? Yes No Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 7 Please provide comment: Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 8 Question 9 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals (for example, impacts on your organisation)? We are concerned that without expert and timely historic environment advice at both site and landscape scale, there will be considerable, inadvertent, irreversible and in most cases unnecessary damage to sites and landscapes over the long term. The scope o f this expertise is two -fold: the recognition that advice is required and sought; the advice itself. As members of the Association for Local Government Archaeologists (ALGAO) Cym ru, we are concerned that without a consistent and coherent approach to the important historic elements of the environment, there will be a discrepancy between approaches to mitigate change where this lies within the remit of NRW and where it does not (for example, in a planning context). This is likely to appear most unreasonable where change is proposed on a large scale. We have particular concerns regarding proposed forestry works, both new plantings and management. We would welcome changes to the White Paper that provided more specific detail on the early consideration of environmental gains and 'win wins' as part of wider social and economic decision making. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 9 Chapter 3 - Natural Resources Wales - new opportunities to deliver Question 10 Do you agree with the proposals set out in chapter 3 in relation to new ways of working for NRW? Yes No x Please provide comment: We would echo the comments above (in terms of the need for co -ordination and consultation with the historic environment sector) , in particular in relation to the proposed new powers for NRW to enter into management agreements with land owners and businesses for the sustainable managemen t of natural resources. Question 11 What limitations or safeguards on the use of powers might be necessary to enable NRW to trial innovative approaches to integrated natural resource management? Requirement to obtain specialist advice on the potential impact on the historic environment. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 10 Question 12 Do you agree that NRW are an appropriate body to act as facilitators, brokers and accreditors of Payments for Ecosystem Services Schemes? Yes No If 'yes', do you consider that there is a need for any new powers to help to further opportunities for PES? Question 13 What should be the extent of NRW's power to enter into management agreements? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 11 Question 14 Recognising that there are some existing powers in this respect, where are the opportunities for General Binding Rules to be established beyond their existing scope? Question 15 In relation to Welsh Ministers' amendment powers, do you support: a) the initial proposal to limit it to NRW's functions, subject to conditions as stated); or b) the additional proposal to cover broader environmental legislation, subject to conditions as stated? A B Please provide comment: Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 12 Question 16 Please state any specific evidence of areas of potential conflict or barriers between the objectives of integrated natural resource management and the application of existing legislation. Question 17 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals, for example, on your business or organisation? This type of curatorial role would be appropriate for our members to carry out, as impartial specialists, since they do not also act as commercial contractors. However, there would be resource implications for our members should they be requir ed to provide specialist advice . Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 13 Chapter 4 - Resource Efficiency Waste Segregation and Collection Question 18 Do you agree with the package of proposals in chapter 4 in relation to the regulation of waste segregation and approach of combining the 5 measures together? Yes No Please provide comment: Are there any other materials or waste streams which should be included in the requirements to sort and separately collect? Yes No If yes, what are they, and why should they be chosen? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 14 Question 19 Do you agree that the level of segregation asked of individuals / businesses is acceptable? Yes No If no, please state why and an alternative.

Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 21 Chapter 5 - Smarter Management Marine Licensing Management Question 3 2 Do you agree with the proposals in relation to Marine Licensing? Yes No x Please provide comment If there are proposals to levy a fee for licen sing, some of this should be used to fund the provision of historic environment advice. Question 3 3 Do you have any comments on whether the Welsh Government should extend NRW's ability to recover costs associated with marine licensing by charging fees for: - pre-application costs? - variation costs? - costs of transferring of licenses? - coverin g regulatory costs, via s ubsistence changes? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 22 Question 3 4 Do you have any comments relating to the impact of the proposals? Shellfisheries Management Question 3 5 Do you agree with the proposal in relation to Shellfishery Orders? Yes No x Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 23 Please provide comment The expansion of sea fisheries in recent years in North Wales, has not benefited the historic environment in which this industry operates. We would welcome a mechanism, such as the aggregate levy, to enable reinvest ment in protect ion of important features of the historic marine environment ( such as harbours, wrecks, preserved terrestrial features on inundated land, fish weirs, tidal mills and so on). Question 3 6 Are there any other changes to the Several and Regulating Order regime that you think should be considered (i.e. can you think of any other ways that current practices could be improved)? Yes No Please provide comment Question 3 7 Do you have any comments on the impact of this proposal (for example, impacts on your business)?

Yes x No Please provide comment We welcome these proposed changes . Question 39 Do you agree with the proposal in relation to changes to Section 47 of the Flood and Water Management Act (2010)? Yes No x Please provide comment We would like greater consultation with historic environment specialists to form part of working protocols in this area. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 26 Question 4 0 Do you have any comments on the impac t of either of these proposals? Implementation / Equalities Question 4 1 We want to ensure that the Environment Bill is reflective of the needs of Welsh Citizens. As such, we would appreciate any views in relation to any of the proposals in this White Paper that may have an impact on a) Human rights b) Welsh langua ge or c) the protected characteristics as prescribed within the Equality Act 2010. These characteristics include gender; age; religion; race; sexual orientation; transgender; marriage or Civil Partnership; Pregnancy and Maternity; and, disability. Question 4 2 Do consultees have any other comments or useful information in relation to any of the proposals in this White Paper? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 27 Should we give consideration to examples? e.g. Carbon storage and water capture Use of stone and earth to block drainage ditches - inadvertent use of prehistoric sites, many of which are not scheduled, when other material could as easily be used. Rewetting is generally good for preservation of remains, but increased peat cover will ob scure sites currently visible and this needs to be recognised and good site records maintained so that these sites aren't damaged in the future when they are no longer visible Area -based approach offers real opportunities - the historic environment is bes t seen in landscape/area terms and the best, most cost -effective results are achieved at this scale Commitment to right information earlier on welcomed; this must include information on the historic environment. A robust and consistent mechanism is requi red for this to be effective Examples of late consultation causing problems? Explanation about why historic environment advice not sought early enough? Emphasis on integration and joined -up approach welcomed, but for this to dovetail with proposals that run formally through the planning system, historic environment advice must be sought outside strict statutory and planning contexts The emphasis on biodiversity is welcomed. All biodiversity is related to human action over the last 10,000 years and canno t be considered separate from it. 'Evidence' and 'Stakeholder engagement' too vague Not sure if historic environment provision fits here 1 Environment Bill White Paper 23 October 2013 - 15 January 2014 Name John Munro Organisation Welsh Retail Consortium Address Suite 103 209 City Road Cardiff CF24 3JD E-mail address john.munro@brc.org.uk Type (please select one from the following) Businesses Local Authorities/Community & Town Councils Government Agency/Other Public Sector Professional Bodies and Associations Third sector (community groups, volunteers, self help groups, co -operatives, enterprises, religious, not for profit organisations) Academic bodies Member of the public Other (other groups not listed above) 2 Chapter 2 - Natural Resource Management Question 1 Do you agree with the overall package of proposals in relation to natural resource management in chapter 2? Yes No Please provide comment: We agree that natural resource management is important and this is very much part of our members' sustainability strategies , which include commitments and targets on zero waste, renewable energy and sustainable sourcing. Our members have learnt this is a journey which requires investment. If the overall package of proposals is to be successful, we recommend that Natural Resource Wales needs to recognise this is a journey and: 1. Support development of infrastructure especially in the area of waste management with grants and flexible plann ing laws; 2. Adopt a voluntary approach rather than a legislative approach ; 3. Avoid lots of red tape 4. Acknowledge that while d efinitions are helpful , an element of flexibility is essential; 5. Allow sufficient time . 2017 is only 3 years away , and the development of new infrastructure , such as building an anaerobic digestion (AD) plant, can take over 4 years to deliver 3 Chapter 4 - Resource Efficiency Waste Segregation and Collection Question 18 Do you agree with the package of proposals in chapter 4 in relation to the regulation of waste segregation and approach of combining the 5 measures together? Yes No Please provide comment: The concern here is whether retailers will have to physically separate these streams of waste at store - this can be an issue for smaller stores where space is very limited . We would welcome confirmation on whether it is acceptable for the waste contracto r to collect these streams as comingled recycling separated from general landfill waste . This comingled recycling can then be sorted at the first level Materials Recovery Facility ( MRF ). Are there any other materials or waste streams which should be included in the requirements to sort and separately collect? Yes No If yes, what are they, and why should they be chosen? Question 19 Do you agree that the level of segregation asked of individuals / businesses is acceptable? Yes No 4 If no, please state why and an alternative. Our members take waste and recycling very seriously and many are working towards a zero waste target. For example, one supermarket member already diverts over 97% of its total waste from landfill and recycles the waste streams specified in the White Paper at source, where it can. This retailer a lso operate s a mixed recycl ing stream in staff/ colleague areas . In addition , it uses MRF s and waste transfer stations for further of segregation of waste before energy recovery. Source segregation is not always possible for all waste. If the intention is that retailers will have to segregate all the streams at sto re, this is not acceptable as retailers do not have enough space at back of store to action this. As stated in our response to Q.18, we agree with the package of proposals in chapter 4 in relation to the regulation of waste segregation only if retailers can present comingled recyclable materials for collection, as opposed to physically separating these waste streams at store. Our members operate at a national level across the four UK nations and we believe it is crucial for any new legislation or regul ations to be as consistent as possible with that in place or proposed for the other UK nations. In this instance, we would recommend that the proposed measures on waste collection and segregation mirror those recently implemented in Scotland, where possib le. Question 2 0 Are there any particular types or sizes of businesses where it would not be technically, environmentally or economically practicable to keep the 7 waste streams separate at source? Yes No If yes, please identify them and explain why. Smaller stores, for example high street stores and convenience stores and food will not have sufficient space to action this. Quick service restaurants Due to the unique complicati ons associated with customer waste separation in the quick - service restaurant (QSR) sector, we would urge the Welsh Government to consult closely with the sector on the waste separation proposals contained within this white paper. The QSR sector includes areas where consumers dispose of their own waste - this is known as 'front -of-house'. Our QSR members are currently working to assess the feasibility of achieving customer separation that results in quality recyclate, however they report that such a requi rement is proving extremely challenging. While our QSR members support legislation that encourages increased recycling, and can put in measures to separate waste from kitchen areas, customer waste is difficult to separate due to the level of contaminatio n and mix of materials used. Any front of house separation requirements would also require significant financial investment, but the QSR members report 5 a very low yield of quality recyclate from front of house tests that have been completed. Clearly, giv en the relatively short timescales involved before implementation, the sector needs clarity on whether the regulations apply to front -of-house operations. If so, we would urge the Welsh Government to meet with representatives of the sector to better unders tand the issues posed, and to discuss potential ways forward. Question 2 1 Do you agree with the materials that we propose to ban from landfill or energy from waste facilities? Yes No Are there any other materials which should be banned from landfill or energy from waste facilities? Yes No If yes, what are they? It is unclear how a ban on certain materials from landfill or energy from waste would be managed and monitored. A v oluntary agreement would be a more preferable approach. Question 2 2 Do you agree that developing guidance for acceptable levels of contamination in residual waste for landfill/ incinerator operators and the regulator is a workable approach? Yes No Guidance on acceptable levels of c ontamination levels would be helpful , but we believe that this should be part of a voluntary agreement and best effort approach , as operating in Scotland If no, what other approach could we adopt? 6 Question 2 3 Do you agree that there should be a prohibition on the disposal of food waste to sewer? Yes No If yes, should this apply to: a) Households b) Businesses and Public Sector c) Both Please provide comment: Question 2 4 Do you have any comments about how such a prohibition should be enforced with i) businesses and public sector and ii) households? Question 2 5 Do you agree that lead in times for the proposals are reasonable? Yes No If no, what alternative lead in time would you suggest? Question 2 6 Do you agree that NRW are the best placed organisation to regulate the duty to source segregated wastes? If no, please give the reason and propose an alternative regulatory body. 7 Yes No Question 27 In your opinion, who is the most appropriate body to regulate the bans on disposal of food waste to sewer for businesses and the public sector: NRW Local Authorities Sewerage undertaker or Other If 'Other' please prop ose an alternative regulatory body and state reasons: Question 2 8 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals (for example, impacts on your organisation)? Additional infrastructure to support the delivery of these proposals is necessa ry. From our members' previous experience, the potential impacts of these proposals are: Additional costs. Recycling is not always the cheapest disposal route. Depending on location of the recycl ing site, the largest part of recycl ing costs can be transport . Retailers will also face training costs and additional bin costs. These extra costs may be offset to some extent by income from the sale of recycl able materials, but this income is market driven and can be very variable. Additional space requirements . These proposals will require retailers to locate space to capture recycl ing stream s, and store and transport recycl able materials. 8 Carrier Bags Question 29 Do you agree with the proposal to extend the enabling powers of the Welsh Ministers so that they may, by regulations, provide for minimum charges to be set for other types of carrier bags in addition to single use carrier bags? Yes No Please provide comment In summary our view is as follows: The Welsh levy for single use carrier bags is a success and has dramatically reduced single use carrier bag usage. Extending the levy to reusable bags is counter intuitive and indeed could drive customers back to using single use bags. Increasing and extending the levy jeopardises public goodwill towards this initiative and is likely to cause confusion. If implemented, there will be a considerable cost to our members. Success of the Welsh levy for single use carrier bags Given the success of Welsh single use carrier bag charge in terms of public support and environmental impact, there is no reason in our opinion to extend the levy to plastic reusable bags for life. One of our supermarket members reports a reduction of over 90% in single use carrier bags in its stores in Wales. This reduction has been accompanied by an increase in sales of all reusable bags as customers adjust to the levy. Additionally, this retailer r eports that at times when customers forget their bags , or purchase more than the bags they have can hold , an inexpensive reusable bag is their usual preferred option. Extending the levy to reusable bags is counter intuitive We welcome the fact that the W elsh Government intends to continue to monitor the amount of reusable plastic carrier bags distributed in Wales and would not use the proposed extended enabling powers unless the sale of reusable bags continues to rise and outstrip sales growth . However we do not believe that a mandatory charge on low cost reusable plastic bags is appropriate as it will penalise customers for doing the right thing and being environmentally conscious. Re-using bags is a totemic environmental behaviour and the extension of this principle to other areas would make a big difference in sustainable consumption. Extending the levy to reusable bags is counter -intuitive for our customers who are being encouraged to switch to reusable bags. There is no evidence that customers will treat some of the lower cost reusable bags as the new 'throw away bag'. There is no evidence available to suggest that extending the levy will have any further environmental impact. In fact, extending the levy to reusable bags may have t he following unintended consequences: Encourag ing consumers to revert to purchas ing single use bag s - which calls into 9 question the purpose of the initial single use carrier bag levy and its success to date in reducing the number of single use bags dist ributed . Some retailers have removed single use carrier bags from their stores and , in order to remain competitive vis -\u00e0-vis their competitors in terms of being able to provide a low cost bag option, would consider reintroducing them if the 5 pence charge is extended to low cost reusable bags. Forcing customers to purchase more expensive and more durable reusable bags . While reuse of these more durable bags is a positive behaviour, it is worth nothing that they need to be used far more than a low cost reusable bag in order to offset their carbon footprint. An Environment Agency study found that while conventional, lightweight carrier bags made from high -density polyethylene (HDPE have the lowest carbon footprin t of any type of bag; a reusable carrier bag made from low -density polyethylene (LDPE) has to be used at least 4 times to have less environmental impact. In contrast, a heavier more durable bag, made from non -woven polypropylene (PP) and a cotton bag woul d have to be used at least 11 and 131 times respectively1. If a charge for low cost reusable bags is introduced, it will have a greater impact on impulse shopping, which is more likely to take place in small and independent retailers and in local communities. It is also likely to have a greater impact on lower income families who are less receptive to environmental initiatives and more likely to make more frequent, s maller purchases. Costs to retailers If the carrier bag levy was to be extended reusable bags, introducing it would come at considerable cost to our members' businesses, for example in terms of IT and unique bag bar - coding for Welsh stores. Market research in Northern Ireland To conclude, we would highlight the findings of market research recently conducted in Northern Ireland by Lucid talk on behalf of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium (NIRC). This survey asked consumers about a propos ed 5 p levy in Northern Ireland for plastic reusable bags costing 20p or less. The headline results were as follows: 92% of consumers were NOT aware of the proposed 5p tax on reusable bags; 94% of Consumers do NOT want the proposed 5p tax on reusable bags; 50% of consumers usually or always take reusable bags with them when they shop ; 77% of consumers do use reusable bags again ; and 11% of consumers would move from reusable bags to single use bags if a tax is introduced for reusable bags. Question 3 0 Do you agree with the proposal to extend the enabling powers of the Welsh Ministers so that they may, by regulations, require retailers to pass on their net proceeds to any good causes? Yes No 1 Environment Agency. Life Cycle Assessment of Supermarket Carrier Bags Report: SC030148 10 Please provide comment We welcome the fact that should Ministers choose to make regulations requiring retailers to pass on the net proceeds from the 5 pence carrier bag charge, these regulations would enable retailers to pass on proceeds to any type of good cause rather than restricting them to environmental good causes in particular. However, we believe that the current voluntary code is the appropriate approach and is working well. T he British Retail Consortium (BRC) and the Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) have encouraged the English and Scottish Governments to adopt a similar code. We are keen to work with our members and the Welsh Government to ensure that the voluntary code continues to be effective.

Yes No Please provide comment: Question 2 Do you agree with the approach to define natural resources, sustainable management of natural resources and integrated natural resource management in Wales? Yes No x Please provide comment: The Institute welcomes the opportunity to comment on the bill which sets the framework for how Natural Resource Wales will operate in the future. The Institute is concerned that the way the bill has been written makes it hard to read and much of the terminology and underlying ideas are so broad that they will be difficult to regulate. Question 3 Do you agree that climate resilience and climate change mitigation should be embedded into our proposed approach to integrated natural resource management at Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 4 both national and local levels? Yes x No Please provide comment: Question 4 Do you agree that the setting of national outcomes and priority actions for natural resource management should follow the five -year cycle for national outcome setting as proposed in the Future Generations Bill? Yes No Please provide comment: Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 5 Question 5 Do you agree that the area -based approach will help provide a clear, prioritised and focussed approach to delivery? Yes No Please provide comment: Question 6 Do you agree that the approach is flexible enough to enable significant elements of the plans for natural resource managemen t to be replaced in the future? Yes No Please provide comment: Question 7 Do you agree with placing a requirement on other public bodies to co -oper ate in the Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 6 area-based approach ? Yes x No Please provide comment: Question 8 Do you agree that NRW should be the lead reporting authority for natural resources? Yes x No Please provide comment: Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 7 Question 9 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals (for example, impacts on your organisation)? The Institute think that a key issue to come out of this bill is the need for NRW and Welsh Government to commit to work with all stakeholders. The Institute is concerned that there is still no firm commitment to deliver the Welsh Woodland Strategy, a good example of this lack of cohesiveness is the fact that th e Welsh woodland strategy is not mentioned or referenced within the recent consultation on the NRW corporate plan . The formation of NRW was supposed to cut regulation and improve services which the Institute had assumed would include more joined up working with Governmen t, but this does not seem to be the case. The Institute is very concerned that it is proposed to change the woodland strategy potentially just to fit within a new format. The Institute believe that this energy would be better using working to promote the current strategy. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 8 Chapter 3 - Natural Resources Wales - new opportunities to deliver Question 10 Do you agree with the proposals set out in chapter 3 in relation to new ways of working for NRW? Yes No Please provide comment: Question 11 What limitations or safeguards on the use of powers might be necessary to enable NRW to trial innovative approaches to integrated natural resource management? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 9 Question 12 Do you agree that NRW ar e an appropriate body to act as facilitators, brokers and accreditors of Payments for Ecosystem Services Schemes? Yes No If 'yes', do you consider that there is a need for any new powers to help to further opportunities for PES? Question 13 What should be the extent of NRW's power to enter into management agreements? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 10 Question 14 Recognising that there are some existing powers in this respect, where are the opportunities for General Binding Rules to be established beyond their existing scope? The Institute have major concerns that the proposed introduction of general binding rules in forestry is increasing regulation but the Institute is unable to see what additional benefit this may bring. Question 15 In relation to Welsh Ministers' ame ndment powers, do you support: a) the initial proposal to limit it to NRW's functions, subject to conditions as stated); or b) the additional proposal to cover broader environmental legislation, subject to conditions as stated? A B x Please provide comment: The Institute are also concerned that this proposal will allow future legislation with limited subsequent opportunity for scrutiny or detailed rules. Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 11 Question 16 Please state any specific evidence of areas of potential conflict or barriers between the objectives of integrated natural resource management and the application of existing legislation. The Institute are concerned that this proposal to introduce more charges is disproportionate and will stifle business. Question 17 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals, for example, on your business or organisation? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 12 Chapter 4 - Resource Efficiency Waste Segregation and Collection Question 18 Do you agree with the package of proposals in chapter 4 in relation to the regulation of waste segregation and approach of combining the 5 measures together? Yes No x Please provide comment: The Institute questions this proposal to segregate treated wood from untreated wood and is concerned this may lead to additional illegal fly tipping. The Institute also understand that as a result of segregation untreated wood would not be allowed to be burnt. The biomass sector within Wales is increasing in size and popularity with the public, and is an important source of income for woodland owners a nd also within the context of the Welsh rural economy. Whilst recent announcements within Wales are supportive in the use of wood as fuel, this regulation would seem to go against policy and send s a mixed message. Are there a ny other materials or waste streams which should be included in the requirements to sort and separately collect? Yes No Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 13 If yes, what are they, and why should they be chosen? Question 19 Do you agree that the level of segregation asked of individuals / businesses is acceptable? Yes No If no, please state why and an alternative. Question 2 0 Are there any particular types or sizes of businesses where it would not be technically, environmentally or economically practicable to keep the 7 waste streams separate at source? Yes No Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 14 If yes, please identify them and explain why. Question 2 1 Do you agree with the materials that we propose to ban from landfill or energy from waste facilities? Yes No Are there any other materials which should be banned from landfill or energy from waste facilities? Yes No If yes, what are they? Question 2 2 Do you agree that developing guidance for acceptable levels of contamination in residual waste for landfill/ incinerator operators and the regulator is a workable approach? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 15 Yes No If no, what other approach could we adopt? Question 2 3 Do you agree that there should be a prohibition on the disposal of food waste to sewer? Yes No If yes, should this apply to: a) Households b) Businesses and Public Sector c) Both Please provide comment: Question 2 4 Do you have any comments about how such a prohibition should be enforced with i) businesses and public sector and ii) households? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 16 i) ii) Question 2 5 Do you agree that lead in times for the proposals are reasonable? Yes No If no, what alternative lead in time would you suggest? Question 2 6 Do you agree that NRW are the best placed organisation to regulate the duty to source segregated wastes? If no, please give the reason and propose an alternative regulatory body. Yes No Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 17 Question 27 In your opinion, who is the most appropriate body to regulate the bans on disposal of food waste to sewer for businesses and the public sector: NRW Local Authorities Sewerage undertaker or Other If 'Other' please propose an alternative regulatory body and state reasons: Question 2 8 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals (for example, impacts on your organisation)? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 18 Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 19 Carrier Bags Question 29 Do you agree with the proposal to extend the enabling powers of the Welsh Ministers so that they may, by regulations, provide for minimum charges to be set for other types of carrier bags in addition to single use carrier bags? Yes No Please provide comment Question 3 0 Do you agree with the proposal to extend the enabling powers of the Welsh Ministers so that they may, by regulations, require retailers to pass on their net proceeds to any good causes? Yes No Please provide comment Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 20 Question 3 1 Do you have any comments on the impact of these proposals (for example, impacts on your organisation)? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 21 Chapter 5 - Smarter Management Marine Licensing Management Question 3 2 Do you agree with the proposals in relation to Marine Licensing? Yes No Please provide comment Question 3 3 Do you have any comments on whether the Welsh Government should extend NRW' s ability to recover costs associated with marine licensing by charging fees for: - pre-application costs? - variation costs? - costs of transferring of licenses? - coverin g regulatory costs, via s ubsistence changes? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 22 Question 3 4 Do you have any comments relating to the impact of the proposals? Shellfisheries Management Question 3 5 Do you agree with the proposal in relation to Shellfishery Orders? Yes No Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 23 Please provide comment Question 3 6 Are there any other changes to the Several and Regulating Order regime that you think should be considered (i.e. can you think of any other ways that current practices could be improved)? Yes No Please provide comment Question 3 7 Do you have any comments on the impact of this proposal (for example, impacts on your business)? Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 24 Welsh Government - Responding to the consultation 25 Land Drainage Management / Flood and Water Management Question 3 8 Do you agree with the proposal in relation to changes to Section 29 of the Land Drainage Act (1991)?
