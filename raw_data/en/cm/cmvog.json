During the third year of the development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we have learned to accept novel routines and behaviors, and to appreciate the importance of high quality scientific research and effective communication. In addition to understanding the virus that causes this disease, an equally important factor to consider is the immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. From an asymptomatic to acute severe respiratory syndrome, including a vast range of potentially chronic symptoms, the manner by which the host recognizes and responds to infection must be understood to guide the treatment strategies to achieve the best possible outcome. Innate immune responses may potentially control viral replication with little systemic changes, or induce a cytokine storm that causes severe immunopathology. Adaptive immune responses induced by vaccination or natural infection should be well-defined to determine the limits of reliable and long-term protection. This Special Issue aims to provide an in-depth knowledge of host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present Special Issue invites submissions of original research articles and reviews. The areas of research areas may include (but are not limited to) the following: immune response to COVID-19 natural infection versus mRNA vaccines, immune response to COVID-19 variants in vaccinated and unvaccinated people, immune response to COVID-19 infection in people with underlying conditions, the cause of vanning immunity in vaccinated people, immune response to COVID-19 in humans and animals, immune response in humans superinfected different variants. We look forward to receiving your contributions. Dr. Velmurugan Balaraman Guest Editor Manuscript Submission Information Manuscripts should be submitted online at [www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/) by [registering](https://www.mdpi.com/user/register/) and [logging in to this website](https://www.mdpi.com/user/login/). Once you are registered, [click here to go to the submission form](https://susy.mdpi.com/user/manuscripts/upload/?journal=vaccines). Manuscripts can be submitted until the deadline. All submissions that pass pre-check are peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website. Research articles, review articles as well as short communications are invited. For planned papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words) can be sent to the Editorial Office for announcement on this website. Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference proceedings papers). All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a single-blind peer-review process. A guide for authors and other relevant information for submission of manuscripts is available on the [Instructions for Authors](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/vaccines/instructions) page.
