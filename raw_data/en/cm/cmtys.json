About the Galleries and Designers Our gallery explores the perils of the American School System. Bullying. Covid Learning. Overcrowding. Don't Say Gay. All of these experiences impact the upbringing of children in this country. We chose this theme to bring awareness to the realities of children's daily obstacles. We hope that this gallery acts as a catalyst for positive change. This gallery may make you uncomfortable, but that's the point. Imagine yourself as a student while walking through these classrooms. Think like a child. How do these surroundings affect you? How do they affect your loved ones? How do they affect the world? Shannon Kunkel I am a senior at Nova Southeastern University in South Florida. During the pandemic, I decided to switch my major from criminal justice to art and design with a concentration in graphic design. Growing up in Miami, the surrounding arts and culture helped shape my designs in many ways. I aspire to launch my own design business where I bring people's ideas to life. I am proficient in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Lightroom. Product design and branding are my forte but I am excited to expand my portfolio. Most of my days consist of spending time in nature -- roller skating, surfing, or photographing my beautiful surroundings. You'll find much of my creative inspiration comes from my experiences in nature. Nicholas Waguespack I am a junior art and design major with a concentration in studio art. My art explores my identity as a queer individual from south Louisiana. My understanding and perception of both my past and current art is constantly changing as I continue to learn and accept more about myself, and as I gain more knowledge about different artists and techniques. My most recent paintings and prints explore my relationship with my childhood and growing up in a conservative space where I was forbidden from expressing my genuine self. Addiction is not a new problem. For as long as humanity has had access to drugs there have been those who fall ill with substance abuse disorders. There is also a widespread stigma that those who suffer from these disorders are criminals and villains that deserve to be punished. They are often blamed for using substances and any consequences that result from their addiction -- a stigma that likely stems from the criminalization of drugs, political agendas, or simply a lack of education that was passed down through generations. As science and research advanced through the years it became widely understood that addiction is a disease caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. Those who suffer from substance abuse disorders will not find it easy to simply stop without outside help - help that many do not seek \\due to the stigma that surrounds addiction. It is important to view those with substance abuse disorders as deserving of compassion and kindness, to hear their stories and be open to understanding their condition. Breaking the stigma is the first step to encourage people to get help before they fall into a vicious cycle, and to build a better system to treat addiction. Eleanor Wind I am a sophomore student from Barrington, Rhode Island. I am studying biology and neuroscience at Nova Southeastern University. I am involved in Alzheimer's and addiction research at NSU. My goals are to attend graduate school and pursue a career as a healthcare provider. Art was always a passion of mine and I am eager to take the opportunity to learn more about design while in school. I was pleased to find that I enjoy the visual problem - solving challenges that graphic design provides. While my future aspirations lie outside the realm of design, I still hope to use my knowledge to help bring awareness to and solve problems in healthcare. Pollution has been affecting the oceans for centuries now and it is all caused by human actions. Everyday we use plastic, solid waste, excess amounts of carbon dioxide, and much more without realizing the effects these have on the environment around us. Our lives are affected and irreversibly changed everyday by these pollutants with little to no action to prevent worse problems. We want our future to be brighter and cleaner for us and generations after because this is our only home. We (Jessica and Alexandra) hope to bring you through this immersive experience to show the different types of pollutants that are affecting the oceans and the marine organisms. We aim to show the simple ways humans can help everyday to reduce the issue of ocean pollution. Alexandra Achenbach As a design student in today's world, I look to create work that has meaning for my own life, as well as the world we live in. I'm currently a sophomore studying marketing with a minor in graphic design at Nova Southeastern University. Originally from Massachusetts, I moved to Florida because of my love for the ocean and the environment. Whenever I am given the chance to pick a project topic, I choose to promote environmental awareness. Using my current knowledge and what I'm learning, I create work that is pleasing to the eye and emphasizes the idea I want to promote. I enjoy creating powerful visuals where words are not needed to convey the message. I want others to see my work and feel as strongly as I do about protecting our planet because we don't have another; we don't have a backup plan. Jessica Jagoda I'm a sophomore majoring in marine biology with a minor in marine ecology at Nova Southeastern University. I grew up in New Port Richey, Florida, and was born in New York. I discovered my affinity for graphic design in high school in the New Media academy. I also fell in love with the adrenaline rush and teamwork required while playing sports at an early age. I kill it at soccer, track, and cross country. I always wanted to work in a field that protects and fights for the ocean. As of right now, that means maritime law. With this, I hope to apply my knowledge in marine biology to influence policies that help safeguard the oceans. Social media's impact on mental health is an issue of recent concern. Instagram and Facebook are currently facing criticism for allegedly promoting eating disorder accounts to young girls. Social media is a growing staple in adult lives as well as younger generations. We aim to highlight the drastic difference between what people display on social media versus reality. What many people fail to realize is that people mostly share the best parts of them and their lives. In this environment, it can be hard for people, especially children, to decipher between reality and what they see on TikTok and other platforms. It can cause feelings of loneliness which lead to insecurities that can manifest into larger issues. A growing amount of evidence shows the increase in mental illnesses consequent to social media usage. Our goal is to share the reality behind these platforms. Not just to kids, but to parents and grandparents and anyone with a family member or friend with social media. Anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and the like are difficult to overcome, but utilizing social media in positive ways can make a huge difference. We hope you walk away from this experience with a new perspective that allows you to detach from harmful social media practices and live your most authentic life. Olivia Blankenship I am currently a sophomore at Nova Southeastern University completing a degree in communications with a concentration in digital media. I'm originally from North East Maryland and my goal is work in the music industry. Being educated in the field of graphic design goes beyond just knowing how to use illustrator. It involves solving problems, being proactive and finding new ways to make society more inclusive through sharing perspectives. All skills I can apply to music to help me become a more authentic and proactive artist. Graphic Design shows us how to curate an audience while at the same time not losing one's authenticity. This is something extremely important to me that I hope to carry into my career. Jason Bell I grew up in Pleasantville, NY and moved to South Florida as a teenager. After high school, I decided to attend Nova Southeastern University in pursuit of a degree in computer science, not knowing fully what I really wanted to do. As a current junior, I am pursuing a career in video game development with a future goal to be an inventor. I try to live by certain values in life, the main ones being \"carpe diem,\" that bonds with others are the most important in life, and no matter how bad it gets, never give up because you can always come back. My skills and expertise are mainly programming-related as well as creativity. My hobbies are playing games and collecting Pops! Gun violence is a contemporary threat to countless people in America. Firearms remain as one of the leading causes of death amongst children and teens. Too many Americans die from gun violence every year. Background checks do not apply to total gun sales, allowing over many purchases to be made without accountability. In addition, burglaries and car theft would occur less frequently if the law did not permit large scale legal gun ownership. As students in south Florida, the unfortunate tragedy of Marjory Stoneman Douglas presented an internal call to action, to enhance gun control laws and abolish such events from happening in the future. Our gallery features three rooms of design pieces that inspect gun violence, including statistics and text descriptions across the designs to create an experience that will further enhance the understanding of gun violence in the country. Through this gallery we hope to demonstrate the perilous and devastating nature of the gun violence epidemic. We also hope to illustrate how such an epidemic is profited from by corporations. Mingyang Xi I'm in my second year at Nova Southeastern University majoring in art and design. I lived in Northern China for 10 years and now live in Florida. Ever since I learned to read, I was fascinated by illustrations that I came across online, and eventually I realized my professional goal is to become an illustrator. I'm experienced with digital illustrations, particularly using Adobe Photoshop, and I regularly experiment to learn new drawing and design techniques. My main interests and hobbies include acoustic engineering, music, home cooking, all kinds of games, and tennis. Gabriella Neves What drives me to return to my nifty studio (a desk stacked in the corner of my bedroom) is my instinctual need to create. My work is a culmination of my own experiences twinged with some length of absurdity. This creates a process that will never drain me with monotony. Based in South Florida, I'm pursuing a degree at NSU as a sophomore in marketing and design. I am a Brazilian-Argentinian artist, and I find that this bleeds into my personal work often. In the future, I plan to expand into design full-time, exploring different media to create immersive experiences. It has been 3 years since a group of friends went for a late dinner at a nice restaurant. After some time, something was not right with one of them. She was feeling dizzy and hungover. They immediately decided to drop off their friend first. After they arrived at their college dorm, they received the call. It was their friend crying on the phone not knowing what to do. Someone had followed her through her house door. Similar events might have happened to someone you know, someone who was a victim of sexual assault, or you might know the person who committed the assault. The trauma that victims suffer reverberates for a long time. This gallery will reflect on sexual assault, which happens more often than many imagine, and it is a topic that many consider taboo. Sexual assault affects thousands of people no matter their age, race, ethnicity, gender, or background. The purpose of this gallery is to raise awareness that sexual assault is a prominent issue that we, as a society, must eradicate through education. Maria Asimopoulou I am a freshman with a major in marketing and a double minor in entrepreneurship and venture creation.
