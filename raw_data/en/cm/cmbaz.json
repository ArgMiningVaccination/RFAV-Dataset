Flu shots have been proven to reduce absences and can help protect against workflow disruptions. The Lake Crystal Pharmacy can help employers who would like to take part in this preventive measure for their staff. A pharmacist from the Lake Crystal Pharmacy can either travel to a work place to administer the vaccine, or employees can instruct their staff to schedule an appointment at the pharmacy. If employers are interested in setting up a flu shot clinic, they should contact the pharmacy directly at 507.726.1110. Flu shot clinics for individuals will again be held at all Madelia Health clinics., including Madelia, Lake Crystal and Truman. Dates for the clinics will be announced later this month.

Getting a flu shot prevents you from passing the virus to people in high-risk populations like babies, pregnant women, elderly people, and people who have chronic diseases. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that everyone six months of age and older get vaccinated every flu season. Preventing flu is always important, but in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it's even more important to do everything possible to reduce illnesses and preserve scarce health care resources. Influenza and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses caused by viruses that can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The signs and symptoms of the flu and COVID-19 are very similar. Seasonal flu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Symptoms of COVID-19 can include fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, headache, muscle pain, sore throat, fatigue, congestion, or loss of taste or smell. Other less common symptoms of COVID-19 include gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
