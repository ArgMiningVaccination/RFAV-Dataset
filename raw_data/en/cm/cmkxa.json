The Performance Triad is a pilot program launched by the Office of the Army Surgeon General and Army Medicine. The three pillars of the Performance Triad are activity, nutrition and sleep. \"Overall as an Army we are coming from being in a state of war to being in a state of recovery and rebuilding,\" said APG Performance Triad Action Officer 1st Lt. Joanna Moore, from Kirk U.S. Army Health Clinic. \"Our focus is changing from healing to preventing illnesses in the first place.\" The Performance Triad program complements the DoD's Operation Live Well campaign, the Army's Ready & Resilient Campaign, R2C, and the Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness Program. The Performance Triad program was implemented in 2013 by Lt. Gen. Patricia D. Horoho, Army surgeon general and commander of the U.S. Army Medical Command. Horoho said that to reduce costs and remain mission-ready Army Medicine needs to transition from a health care system focused on treating disease to a system for health, focused on prevention. According to Military OneSource, obesity and tobacco use among U.S. military health care beneficiaries adds more than $3 billion per year to the Department of Defense budget in health care costs and lost duty days. According to the Center for Disease Control, more than one-third of all Americans are obese. \"The Army is supposed to be setting the standard for health and fitness, if we are not all in one hundred percent, we cannot expect the rest of America to follow suit,\" Moore said. Moore said that the Performance Triad program encourages people to achieve and maintain balance in all three areas. Experts recommend people get seven to eight hours of sleep per day, walk at least 10,000 steps per day and eat a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Performance Triad Events The festivities start May 7 with a 5K Run and 2 mile walk from 6:30 to 8 a.m. in the Main Exchange (formerly known as the PX) parking lot. Those who are interested in participating should register at http://performancetriad5k.eventbrite.com. The first 50 participants registered will receive a free t-shirt. Moore recommends that participants come to the event early. After the run, at 10 a.m. will be an \"APG Healthy Kids Kickoff\" for preschool-aged children who attend the Child Development Center and Family Child Care program in the APG North (Aberdeen) recreation center. During this event, Soldiers will lead the children in various activities, including an obstacle course, dancing, and the game \"Red Light, Green Light.\" Soldiers will also teach children about nutrition and sleep. Moore said that she plans to organize an \"APG Healthy Kids\" event for older children in the summer. \"I think the concepts of sleep, activity and nutrition should be taught to children at a young age,\" Moore said. Performance Triad Health Fair kicks off at 11 a.m. Local nutritionists, physical fitness trainers, physical therapists and other representatives will be on hand to answer questions and provide information. Massage therapists will also give free mini massages. The Slim Down Challenge Finale takes place during this event, from noon to 12:30 p.m. The \"biggest losers\" from across the installation will be recognized for their efforts in achieving improved overall health and wellness. In addition to the May 7 kickoff, the Army Wellness Center will also host several events throughout the week. On Monday, May 5, there will be a circuit training class from 11 a.m. to noon in front of the Myer Auditorium in the C4ISR Campus, Bldg. 6000, and another one in the atrium of ATEC Headquarters, Bldg. 2202, from 12:30 to 1:30 p.m. On Tuesday, May 6, AWC staff members will show Commissary customers healthy alternative during the \"Healthier Way to Shop\" tours from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the APG Commissary. A \"Healthy Sleep Habits\" class is set for noon to 1 p.m., Thursday, May 8, at the Army Wellness Center, located on the third floor of KUSAHC. Throughout the year the AWC, KUSAHC, the U.S. Army Public Health Command and the Community Health Promotion Council will team together to host Performance Triad events. All activities are free and open to Soldiers, DoD civilians, contractors, retirees and Family members. For more information contact Moore at 410-278-1773 "}
