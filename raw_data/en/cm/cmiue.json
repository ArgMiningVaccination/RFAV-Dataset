[1](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-menopause) Women who have undergone a hysterectomy with the removal of their ovaries will undergo immediate menopause. However, for most, this is a gradual process, and brings with it a variety of symptoms that can negatively impact daily life, including insomnia and other sleep issues, hot flashes, mood disorders, cognitive decline, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction. [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6419242/) Women going through menopause are also more susceptible to cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and diabetes, so taking care of your health during this time is crucial. [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17364594/) Naturopathic Medicine for Menopause 51% of women use complementary and alternative medicine to manage the symptoms of menopause. [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6419242/) There are a number of different naturopathic approaches to menopause, including mind-body practice, herbal and vitamin supplementation, hormone replacement and dietary changes. [5](https://naturemed.org/faq/faq-how-do-naturopathic-doctors-help-women-during-perimenopause/) Naturopathic doctors also recognize that this can be an emotional time for some women as they come to terms with the end of their natural fertility, and journaling or counseling can be helpful. Physical Activity Engaging in physical exercise on a regular basis has been shown to improve joint and bone health, increase metabolism, reduce stress, and improve sleep. [6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25449820/) [7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8980207/) Targeted physical activity can help prevent osteoporosis as well as help to manage menopause-related weight gain, low mood, and sleep issues. Pelvic floor exercises are also often preventatively recommended for sexual health and bladder issues. Removing Trigger Foods During menopause, your body may become sensitive to foods that you used to be able to tolerate. It is a good idea to reevaluate your nutrition during menopause in case there are any substances you are consuming that are making your symptoms worse. For example, caffeine, spicy food and alcohol can be associated with increased hot flashes. [8](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25051286/) Blood sugar regulation is also important, as spikes in blood sugar may increase menopause symptoms for some.

The literature is still developing for some of these therapies as well. Herbs commonly recommended for use in managing menopause include black cohosh, soy, flax seed, ginseng, red clover, evening primrose oil, alfalfa.
