Now she explores the exciting possibilities for health and well-being by combining whole body vibration with homeopathy. Homeopathy, based on the principle of like cures like, is an energy medicine that treats each person individually by stimulating his or her own natural healing ability.

Chambers presents this latest concept in healing with research from expert resources, including publications such as Lancet, the British Medical Journal, and the New England Journal of Medicine, along with inspiring stories from her own clients. Homeopathy Plus Whole Body Vibration offers exciting possibilities in the treatment of illness and the quest to reach our highest potential.

A True Fountain of Youth, whole body vibration's revolutionary capacity to boost energy, mood, memory, sleep, libido, muscle strength, bone density, balance, and flexibility directly addresses the specific physical challenges most people face as they age - and the results of a 2019 survey of Chambers's clients show that seniors can achieve these benefits, too, along with dramatic decreases in pain levels.

Excerpts from Homeopathy Plus Whole Body Vibration Editorial Reviews This book presents ideas that are novel and new\u2014it is a must read for the large number of people who have turned toward holistic medicine. The concept of mixing energy stimulation or modulation into a therapeutic regimen is very relevant in clinical practice. I highly recommend this book. \u2014Stephen Holt, MD, DSc, ND, Distinguished Professor of Medicine Emeritus Becky Chambers, in her person\u2014as she has lived her life\u2014and in writing her new book, Homeopathy Plus Whole Body Vibration: Combining Two Energy Medicines Ignites Healing, has begun the work of bringing together two fields not usually connected. This is a book that I, as a Jungian analyst, will recommend to many in my depth psychology practice where we continuously probe the interface of body and soul, soma and psyche. This book helps all of us understand how the \"releasing\" of symptomatic issues takes place through many layers manifest in body and psyche. Her work also helps us understand how to bring about healing. \u2014Thomas J. Kapacinskas, JD, NCPsyA, past president, Chicago Society of Jungian Analysts I've been a big believer in energy medicine and healing modalities for over twenty years and have incorporated many of them in my own healthcare regimen. In today's world, we are bombarded on a regular basis with advertisements for pharmaceuticals to take care of a whole host of symptoms\u2014and, of course, that's after you listen to or read a long list of possible side effects (including death). More than ever, many of us are interested in living healthy, vibrant lives\u2014especially as we age. It's past time that we investigate healthcare solutions used by physicians all over the world that are powerful, gentle, and have no side effects. In Homeopathy Plus Whole Body Vibration, Becky Chambers introduces us to two therapies that are powerful on their own. Combined, they offer a synergistic healing force that can rock your world\u2014your body, your mind, and your spirit. Read some of the real-life healing journeys that Chambers shares. If what you've been doing isn't working and/or if you're ready to optimize your health and have your energy soar, this could be for you. \u2014Ann Quasman, chief fulfillment officer and creator of Conscious Conversations Caf\u00e9 on WomanTalk Live Radio, [www.WomanTalkLive.com](http://www.womantalklive.com/) Becky Chambers has introduced the intriguing idea that the combination of homeopathy and whole body vibration works better for healing than each of the systems individually. Read the book; the combination may work for you. Even scientific materialists should be interested because Chambers presents a new nanotechnology-based theory in support of homeopathy along with older theories. \u2014Amit Goswami, PhD Quantum physicist and author of The Quantum Doctor and Quantum Economics Being a one-trick pony, I am always impressed when an accomplished homeopath takes on the task of mastering a second field of healing. Like Whitmont (homeopathy and Jungian thought), Helms (homeopathy and TCM), and Nerman (homeopathy and cranial osteopathy), Becky Chambers has written a text which expands our understanding of two fields.
