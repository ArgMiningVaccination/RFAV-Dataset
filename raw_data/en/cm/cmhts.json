The infection causes reproductive, respiratory, and gastrointestinal disease with the generation of persistently infected animals that spread the infection in the herds. The aim of this chapter was to summarize the results of the validation of a guinea pig model as an alternative method for BVDV vaccine potency testing. Guinea pigs were immunized with 2 doses of killed vaccines formulated in oil or aqueous adjuvant, 21 days apart, and sampled at 30 post-vaccination days (pvd). The kinetics of BVDV Ab responses to vaccination in guinea pigs measured by VN was compared with the VN Ab responses of similarly vaccinated seronegative cattle. The guinea pig model showed a dose-response relationship to the BVDV antigen concentration of the vaccine, independently of the adjuvant used, and it was able to discriminate among vaccines containing 1 log10 difference in their antigen concentration. A regression analysis of the VN Ab titers obtained in guinea pigs and bovines at 30 and 60 pvd, respectively, allowed us to classify vaccines into two or three potency categories: \"very satisfactory\", \"satisfactory\", and \"unsatisfactory\". A concordance analysis including gold standard and commercial, killed, and subunit vaccines showed substantial to almost perfect agreement between the model and the target species for vaccine classification. A colostrum-deprived calf model using two BVDV strains was also standardized, which will allow the relationship between Ab titer in guinea pigs and cattle and protection from infection and disease to be established. Finally, a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is undergoing validation in order to have a complete technological package to transfer to the animal health authorities for the harmonized quality control of BVDV vaccines.
