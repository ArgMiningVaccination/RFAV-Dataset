Your immune response to COVID-19 vaccination may not be as strong as in people who are not immunocompromised. As with vaccines for other diseases, you are protected best when you stay up to date with your COVID-19 vaccines. That means you should get all the COVID-19 vaccine doses recommended for you, when eligible. Who is moderately or severely immunocompromised? Many conditions and treatments can cause a person to be immunocompromised (having a weakened immune system). People are considered to be [moderately to severely immunocompromised](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html) if they have: - Been receiving active cancer treatment for tumors or cancers of the blood. - Received an organ transplant and are taking medicine to suppress the immune system. - Received a stem cell transplant within the last two years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system. - Moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency (such as DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome). - Advanced or untreated HIV infection. - Active treatment with high-dose corticosteroids or other drugs that may suppress their immune response Talk to your healthcare provider about COVID-19 vaccination and your medical condition. If you don't have a health care provider, call 211. Language assistance is available. You can self-attest to your moderately or severely immunocompromised status. This means that you do not need any documentation of your status in order to receive COVID-19 vaccine doses wherever they are offered. Staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccines while moderately or severely immunocompromised You are up to date with your COVID-19 vaccines when you have completed a [primary series](/covid-19/vaccine-booster.htm#definitions) and, when eligible, received the most recent booster dose recommended for you. The recommendations will be different depending on your health status, your age, and which vaccine you received. You can use the CDC's (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) [COVID-19 booster tool](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html) to learn if and when you can get boosters to stay up to date with your COVID-19 vaccines. If you are not moderately or severely immunocompromised, see the [vaccine guidance for most people.](/covid-19/vaccine-booster.htm) Children ages 6 months-11 years Note: Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use different age groups for their children's vaccines.

However, immunocompromised people may still have a reduced immune response. To stay protected against COVID-19, the Department of Health Services recommends all Wisconsinites continue to practice layered COVID-19 prevention strategies based on their COVID-19 Community Level and individual level of risk. This means it is still important for immunocompromised people to continue to follow current prevention measures (like wearing a mask and physical distancing) even after being up to date on COVID-19 vaccines. You may also be eligible for [Evusheld](/covid-19/treatments.htm#:~:text=Evusheld,-Evusheld), a medicine given by a health care provider to help prevent you from getting COVID-19. "}
