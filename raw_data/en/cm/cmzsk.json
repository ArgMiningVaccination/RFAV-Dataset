Then COVID-19 arrived, and the numbers spiked.", "sitename": "The New Yorker", "date": "2022-08-12", "cleaned_text": "It's impossible to pinpoint when ob-gyns sensed that preeclampsia\u2014a surge in blood pressure in the later stages of pregnancy that endangers both mother and baby\u2014was increasing among their patients during the [COVID pandemic](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/coronavirus). Preeclampsia affects some two hundred thousand pregnant people in the U.S. per year, and case numbers had been ticking steadily upward for a couple of decades (although some of this increase was attributable to improvements in how doctors diagnose the disease). But this seemed to be more than an uptick; this felt like a jump. Physicians describe not a eureka moment but a creeping realization, a longitudinal hunch. Group texts and Facebook forums lit up with talk of more patients whose labor had to be induced early owing to blood-pressure spikes; doctors told one another that they were seeing more preterm births and more stillbirths. \"Right away, there was chatter about more hypertension and preeclampsia being noticed in the COVID hot spots,\" Jennifer Jury McIntosh, a maternal-fetal-medicine specialist in Milwaukee, said. The coronavirus attacks endothelial cells, which form the cellophane-like lining of blood vessels. Ob-gyns began to suspect that the virus affects the vessels of the placenta, which ferries oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Inflammation, clotting, and other vascular damage in the placenta put the baby at risk for not getting enough oxygen; the baby's growth may slow, or stop. The same damage is also believed to trigger preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders in the mother, which can impair the liver and kidneys, trigger strokes, and even result in death. The closest thing to a surefire remedy is to deliver the placenta, which means inducing labor. In the earliest and most severe cases, which occur before or at the threshold of fetal viability, the treatment for preeclampsia is termination of the pregnancy. \"We were seeing an increase not only in preeclamptic patients but the severity of preeclampsia,\" Alison Petraske, an ob-gyn in Princeton, New Jersey, said. These outcomes, Petraske went on, appeared to have a common denominator. \"It's a general feeling: preeclampsia, intrauterine-growth restriction, later miscarriages, stillbirths\u2014all of it is placental.\" More than two years into the pandemic, the general feeling is solidifying into data. A [study](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/uog.24809) of more than three hundred thousand women in England, conducted in 2020 and 2021, showed that patients who were infected with COVID when they gave birth had higher rates of preeclampsia, emergency C-sections, preterm birth, and stillbirths. Similar findings were reported in a National Institutes of Health study of pregnant people in the U.S. who experienced severe COVID symptoms and also by the [INTERCOVID study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34187688/), which involved more than two thousand pregnant women in eighteen countries, and which showed a strong correlation between COVID infection and preeclampsia and preterm birth, especially for first-time mothers. That study also indicated that COVID infection nearly doubled a pregnant person's chances of developing HELLP syndrome, an extreme variant of preeclampsia that ravages the liver. Perhaps the most startling [study](https://meridian.allenpress.com/aplm/article/146/6/660/477699/Placental-Tissue-Destruction-and-Insufficiency) examined sixty-four stillbirths and four neonatal deaths\u2014all of which involved unvaccinated mothers\u2014across twelve countries, and found that COVID could lead to a novel inflammatory disorder, [SARS-CoV-2 placentitis](https://www.propublica.org/article/covid-maternity-stillbirth-vaccines-pregnancy), which causes \"widespread and severe placental destruction.\" Brigham and Women's Hospital, in Boston, has maintained a biobank of blood and urine samples from pregnant volunteers, collected at various stages of gestation, since 2006. The specimens, kept in deep-freeze storage, serve as a research platform for studying all manner of pregnancy complications. Thomas McElrath, a maternal-fetal-medicine physician at the hospital and a professor of epidemiology at Harvard, told me that the baseline rate of preeclampsia among these subjects has typically been five to six per cent. But, since 2020, that number \"has gone up to over nine per cent and is approaching ten per cent,\" he said. \"It isn't just anecdotal\u2014at least at our institution, we are actually seeing this happen.\" The likelihood of hypertensive complications in the presence of COVID appears to rise according to the severity of the infection, how early it was contracted during the pregnancy, and whether the patient is vaccinated. Pre\u00ebxisting conditions that leave patients vulnerable to both COVID and preeclampsia\u2014obesity, diabetes, chronic hypertension\u2014likely have a compounding effect: one study estimated that having one or more of these conditions along with COVID increased a patient's odds of preeclampsia by a factor of four. The link between the coronavirus and preeclampsia is of particular concern in the U.S., a country that is unusually [terrible at managing](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/the-good-the-bad-and-the-embarrassing-in-americas-covid-19-response) both COVID and pregnancy complications. The U.S. has the [largest share](https://covid19.who.int/) of COVID deaths worldwide. Among developed nations, it ranked last for maternal mortality; according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p0428-pregnancy-hypertension.html), about a third of mothers who died during a hospital delivery in 2019 had a documented hypertensive disorder. And, for infant mortality, the U.S. placed thirty-third out of thirty-six industrialized nations. These numbers predate COVID, of course\u2014as dire as they are, they still trail behind what physicians are seeing in their offices and in their wards. Rakhi Dimino, an ob-gyn based in Houston, is a medical director of operations for the Ob Hospitalist Group, overseeing around twenty hospitals in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Illinois. She is also the chairwoman of the board of directors of the Preeclampsia Foundation, a nonprofit that raises awareness of the disease's symptoms and possible treatments. \"Many of our doctors have been saying, 'I've never seen so many third-trimester stillbirths so close together,' \" Dimino told me. \"It affects you terribly. That wail of a mother when she's lost her baby is something that you don't forget.\" She recalled a patient whose pregnancy had reached full term, and who came to see her a day before she was to be induced. \"There was no heartbeat. Having to look at her and say that we missed it by one day . . .\" Dimino paused. \"It was horrific. Horrific. And I remember\u2014she wasn't the only patient that day who had a stillbirth at term. And these babies, when you deliver them, they look like a normal newborn, only when they deliver they don't take that first breath. They look perfect.\" Dimino has been practicing medicine for sixteen years. In the past year and a half, she said, \"I've seen more of that than I have in my entire career.\" Human beings seem to be the only species\u2014with the possible exception of gorillas\u2014that gets preeclampsia. That lonely distinction may offer clues to the precise cause of [a still enigmatic disease](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/07/24/the-preeclampsia-puzzle). \"One area of speculation is that the human placenta is unique in how very aggressive it is in its search for oxygen and nutrients,\" McElrath said. \"It will embed itself more deeply within the lining of the uterus than is the case for all other forms. That level of invasiveness is needed for the growth of a highly developed brain and central nervous system\u2014and that is, of course, our evolutionary advantage. You need that brain, that very energy-demanding organ, to grow quickly before it exceeds the mother's ability to pass this large-headed baby through her pelvis.\" The earliest, most severe form of preeclampsia, which strikes around the midpoint of pregnancy, is believed to be related to a failure of the fetal cells, known as trophoblasts, \"to invade the maternal vascular system and remodel the maternal blood vessels within the uterine wall, making them much wider,\" McElrath said. These vessels must take on as much as a hundred times more blood volume in pregnancy. \"In the wider form, the blood flows more slowly. If it remains narrow, it's like if you put your finger over the garden hose\u2014it shoots out with more force. That force can damage the undersurface of the placenta.\" It was Aristotle who likely first grasped the basic function of the placenta (\"the vessels join on the uterus like the roots of plants,\" he wrote, \"and through them the embryo receives its nourishment\") and Leonardo da Vinci who correctly guessed that the fetus, through the placenta, had a vascular system that was separate and discrete from that of the mother, a fact that was not conclusively established until the eighteenth century. But instruments for measuring blood pressure were not developed until the late nineteenth century, when physicians soon drew correlations between high blood-pressure readings and the likelihood of seizures during or after childbirth, often presaging death. Preeclampsia was definitively established as a syndrome in the nineteen-twenties, the decade in which Lady Sybil died gruesomely of it on a memorable episode of \"Downton Abbey\" that first aired in 2012. (McElrath told me that the episode raised preeclampsia's profile, making it easier for doctors to talk about the disease with their patients. \" 'Downton Abbey' did a service to those of us in the field,\" he said.) Diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia that were laid down in the nineteen-forties\u2014thresholds for blood pressure and for elevated protein levels in a patient's urine\u2014are still in use today. But it was not until the eighties that James Roberts, of the University of California, San Francisco, in collaboration with several colleagues, began publishing groundbreaking research that linked preeclampsia to endothelial injury. An old saying among ob-gyns, which is mostly still true, is that the cure for preeclampsia is delivery: of the baby, of course, but also of the placenta that seems to cause the condition in the first place. First-time mothers may be surprised to learn that, having defied physics and geometry by pushing out a baby, they must then participate in the anticlimax of pushing out what amounts to a flank steak. I dimly recall, after my first child was born, an excited nurse holding up our apparently unusually beautiful placenta. The umbilical vessels formed a tree of life, she told me, her fingers tracing its roots and branches in wonderment. \"Wow,\" I think I said. Other new mothers are better at expressing their enthusiasm, notably during the two-thousand-tens vogue for repurposing the placenta: cooking and eating it, liquefying it into a skin-care product, or powdering it for use as a vitamin supplement. In a 2013 episode of \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" Kourtney pretends to serve one to her mostly unwitting family as a roast dinner. (\"Is it a brisket?\" Kris asks.) Some risk factors for preeclampsia correlate with affluence: older mothers, especially older first-time mothers, are more likely to get it, as are mothers who have undergone I.V.F., and these characteristics correlate with higher income levels. To a far greater extent, though, preeclampsia in the United States is tied to the wages of structural racism and poverty. The odds that a Black woman in the U.S. will experience preeclampsia is one in eight. Black women are three times more likely than white women to die in childbirth. America's scandalous infant-mortality rate is \"largely driven by the deaths of black babies,\" as Linda Villarosa [wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/magazine/black-mothers-babies-death-maternal-mortality.html) in the Times in 2018; the same can be said of the maternal-mortality rate and Black mothers. Black women are more likely to suffer from comorbidities associated with preeclampsia\u2014including obesity, diabetes, and pre\u00ebxisting hypertension\u2014and less likely to have access to good prenatal care. They are also overrepresented among COVID-related deaths and less likely to be fully vaccinated than white women. Cornelia Graves, a maternal-fetal-medicine specialist in Nashville, told me, \"For African American women, simply the stress of living in America increases the risk of preeclampsia.\" Elevated stress hormones correlate with adverse pregnancy outcomes, another high-risk obstetrician, Lisa Levine, who practices in Philadelphia, said. \"Both Black and white women can experience stressors at work, stressors at home, family stressors, financial stressors, relationship stressors. The difference for Black women is the added lifetime exposure to systemic and other forms of racism. All of it could plausibly cause inflammation, and inflammation has been linked to leading to preeclampsia and preterm birth.\" Environmental risk factors associated with preeclampsia also fall more heavily on Black and low-income neighborhoods, which generally have lower air quality than whiter, wealthier ones: a [study](https://escholarship.org/content/qt1rj588f2/qt1rj588f2.pdf) conducted in Oakland and published last year showed that higher levels of air pollution are associated with increased rates of preeclampsia, and research from [Sweden](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7084298/), [Canada](https://journals.lww.com/environepidem/Fulltext/2021/10000/Ambient_air_pollution_and_inflammatory_effects_in.2.aspx), and [Taiwan](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8044398/) has shown the same strong correlation. One ingenious [study](https://www.macfound.org/media/files/hhm_research_brief_-_living_along_a_busy_highway.pdf) looked at maternal-health outcomes among women who lived near highways before and after E-ZPass tolling systems were installed; the E-ZPass regimes dramatically reduced emissions from the idling engines of cars waiting at toll booths, and, as a result, appeared to effect a startling decrease in local cases of premature birth and low birth weight. As long as enough mystery enshrouds the exact pathophysiology of preeclampsia, prevention and therapeutics will fall short. Physicians can continue to recommend a low-inflammation diet, and, for high-risk patients, a low-dose aspirin regimen. Some practices have begun sending patients home with blood-pressure kits. McElrath is on the clinical advisory board of a pharmaceutical startup in Massachusetts called Comanche Biopharma, which is developing an RNA-based medication for diagnosed preeclampsia cases that will soon enter Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. McIntosh, the maternal-fetal-medicine specialist in Milwaukee, said that, for now, \"We've got some blood-pressure medications that can control things for a while. We've got magnesium, which helps prevent seizures. We have betamethasone, which helps mature fetal lungs for preterm delivery. But these are really just Band-Aids. They're not getting at the underlying treatment of disease.\" There is much about the COVID-preeclampsia link, too, that is still in the realm of hypothesis\u2014in part because COVID itself is constantly mutating, with some variants becoming more infectious but triggering less of an inflammatory response. (The international study of SARS-CoV-2 placentitis showed an especially ferocious correlation between stillbirths and the [Delta variant](https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/the-delta-variant-is-a-grave-danger-to-the-unvaccinated) of 2021.) If COVID eventually becomes [endemic](https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-medicine/coexisting-with-the-coronavirus)\u2014if it settles down into something akin to an annual cold\u2014it's not clear what damage it could continue to do to the placenta and, as a result, what ongoing additional risk that would pose to pregnant people. Angela Bianco, the director of maternal-fetal medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in New York City, told me that, in the literature on COVID and preeclampsia, there are endless variables adding noise to the findings. When in her pregnancy did the patient get COVID? Which variant did she catch? Was she infected for the first time or has she had multiple infections? It may even be impossible to establish a control group for a COVID study, Bianco said, \"because some people might have had it and didn't know it or didn't test at the right time.\" Clinicians aren't even sure whether COVID causes preeclampsia, exacerbates it, or simply mimics it. McElrath's guess is that COVID \"facilitates\" preeclampsia. \"We see it with other infectious diseases. Women who've had flu are more likely to have preeclampsia later on. Women who have urinary-tract infections early in their pregnancy, appendicitis, bad bacterial infections\u2014all are more likely to have preeclampsia. Pregnancy itself is a very pro-inflammatory state, particularly in the third trimester. If you give some people an additional little inflammatory boost, it's going to tip them over the edge into the clinically recognized disease.\" The apparent spike in the decades-long rise of preeclampsia in America, and its correlation with COVID, is a case study in how politics wraps itself around the neck of health care. Political decisions on the federal, state, and local level have enabled the coronavirus's ability to spread. Elected officials have often spotted a political opportunity in confusing or deforming public perception of vaccines, especially when it comes to vulnerable populations such as pregnant people. Of the twelve states that have refused to enact Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, nine of them now have near-total abortion bans. States that have placed the most restrictions on abortion care [tend to be the states](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/28/upshot/abortion-bans-states-social-services.html) with the worst health outcomes for mothers and babies. The decision of a highly politicized Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which [reversed the constitutional right to abortion](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/07/04/we-are-not-going-back-to-the-time-before-roe-we-are-going-somewhere-worse) established by Roe v. Wade, casts a shadow of legal menace over physicians who treat high-risk pregnancies, including those marked by preeclampsia. Abortion or early induction can save the life of a patient in an acute health crisis, but, in many states, such necessary measures could lead to investigations and criminal charges. The fear that now infects the ob-gyn's decision-making process has had predictable and appalling consequences: the physician in Indiana who was investigated by the state attorney general's office for providing an abortion to a ten-year-old child; the patient in Louisiana who was [forced to give birth to a nonviable fetus](https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/article_e6ab3b78-06bf-11ed-82b2-1ff4e4f596d6.html) at sixteen weeks; the woman in Texas who, after miscarrying at eighteen weeks, [endured](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/07/26/1111280165/because-of-texas-abortion-law-her-wanted-pregnancy-became-a-medical-nightmare) four pointless, agonizing days with a worsening uterine infection before an anonymous ethics panel determined that she could receive an abortion. Pregnancy is becoming yet more dangerous in America, when it was already far more dangerous than it should be. Dimino, Graves, and McIntosh all practice in states with near-total abortion bans. Texas, where Dimino lives, permits abortion only to save the pregnant person's life or to avert \"substantial impairment of a major bodily function.\" In Tennessee, Graves's state, the law does not have a \"life of the mother\" exception, per se, but instead stipulates that performing an abortion to preserve the patient's life or health can serve as \"an affirmative defense to prosecution.\" McIntosh is in Wisconsin, where at least two anti-abortion groups are lobbying to remove the clause in the state's anti-abortion law that permits life-saving abortions. The majority of preeclampsia cases become evident after thirty-four weeks of pregnancy, well after viability, when labor can be induced with relative safety for the baby. This is inscribed in the very structure of prenatal care, in which doctor's visits become more frequent as the patient approaches full term. The most alarming cases, however, happen much earlier, perhaps even before the end of the second trimester. \"When it happens that early, it's bad,\" McIntosh said. \"It's not something that can be managed conservatively.\" The treatment, as recommended in guidelines set down by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, is the same as in later cases of preeclampsia: delivery of the placenta, which, at this early stage, effectively means an abortion, either by dilation and evacuation\u2014or D. & E., a procedure that Justice [Samuel Alito](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/whats-missing-from-the-drafted-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade) called \"barbaric\" in his majority decision in Dobbs\u2014or by induction of labor. \"I've been in situations where I'm very thankful for my colleagues who do D. & E.s to save the mom in preeclampsia situations,\" McIntosh told me. Dimino said, \"When you have severe preeclampsia early in pregnancy, it affects your liver, you can go into kidney failure, you can have strokes. Your organs can shut down. It can kill you. I don't know how quickly you're going to progress. And this is the problem that Dobbs creates.\" If one of her patients is deteriorating at twenty weeks, at twenty-two weeks, waiting until the fetus is comfortably past the viability line\u2014or until the fetus has expired\u2014is not an option, Dimino told me. \"If Mom is dead, the baby is dead, too. At that point, you're making a decision to at least save one of them.\" A perverse parallel between the legal decision in Dobbs and the medical phenomenon of preeclampsia is that both place the mother and fetus in essential conflict. \"Every day we keep the mom pregnant puts her at greater and greater risk of the preeclampsia worsening, and every day we keep the baby inside her uterus decreases the risk to the baby,\" McIntosh said. \"It's a balance. But preeclampsia never just goes away if you are pregnant. You are always on borrowed time.\" The post-Dobbs abortion bans leave less time to borrow. What none of these laws can possibly clarify\u2014what medicine, pregnancy, and the human body all refuse to schedule or define\u2014is when, precisely, a pregnancy complication such as preeclampsia becomes life-threatening enough for a medically necessary abortion to comply with the law, or when the measurable cardiac activity of an inevitably doomed fetus becomes less important than a living, suffering person's existence. \"There should never be a time in American medicine,\" Graves said, \"where we are pitting the life of the mother against a fetal heartbeat.\" An earlier version of this article incorrectly described "}
