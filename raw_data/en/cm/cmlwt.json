In other public health news: gene therapy, concussions, categorizing sounds, homeopathic remedies, and autism. [ Stat: Scientists Create A Biomedical Tattoo To Monitor For A Sign Of Cancer ](https://www.statnews.com/2018/04/18/scientists-biomedical-tattoo-cancer/) Scientists have designed a biomedical tattoo that changes color when calcium in the blood is too high \u2014 a tool that they say could one day be used to monitor for the earliest signs of disease. Some types of cancer increase the amount of calcium in the blood before symptoms appear. So researchers engineered cells that turn dark like a tattoo when calcium is too high. They published a proof-of-concept paper on the work Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine.

The results are another sign of the promise of gene therapy, which aims to deliver beneficial genes to patients' cells to replace defective ones.

(Stein, 4/18) [ The New York Times: Concussions May Increase The Risk For Parkinson's Disease ](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/well/live/concussions-may-increase-the-risk-for-parkinsons-disease.html) A traumatic brain injury, even a mild concussion, increases the risk for Parkinson's disease, a new study reports. Researchers identified all patients diagnosed with T.B.I. in a Veterans Health Administration database \u2014 162,935 men and women \u2014 and matched them with the same number of people with similar health and behavioral characteristics but who had not had a brain injury. The study is in Neurology.

Yet even a preschooler knows whether you're talking about a puppy or the weather. Now scientists at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C., have identified a two-step process that helps our brains learn to first recognize, then categorize new sounds even when the differences are subtle. And it turns out the process is very similar to the way the human brain categorizes visual information, the Georgetown team reports Wednesday in the journal Neuron. (Hamilton, 4/18) [ The Washington Post: Homeopath Treated 4-Year-Old's Behavior Problems With Saliva From Rabid Dog ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/04/18/a-4-year-old-had-been-growling-at-preschool-so-this-naturopath-says-she-gave-him-rabid-dog-saliva/) A Canadian naturopath claims she treated a 4-year-old boy's behavioral problems with a controversial homeopathic remedy \u2014 this is, saliva from a rabid dog. The recent claims have caused concern in the medical community and prompted questions about why the saliva \u2014 known as lyssinum, lyssin or hydrophobinum \u2014 has been approved by the Canadian government as a legitimate homeopathic product.

The work, aimed at developing drugs and other targeted, personalized treatments, is underway at the same time as World Autism Month (April) boosts awareness of the challenges faced by people on the autism spectrum.
