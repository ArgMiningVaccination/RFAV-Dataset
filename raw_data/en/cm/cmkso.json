Patients are often overwhelmed by all the treatment options and the different providers. The mental strain of finding quality healthcare combined with the emotional toll can make the road to recovery a long and arduous journey. Conventional medicine often neglects to consider the mental, emotional, and environmental aspects of health and wellness. However, integrative medicine presents a solution. Sandusky Wellness Center provides the Sandusky, OH community with integrative medicine programs that meld traditional techniques with alternative methods, creating a strategic plan meant specifically for you. Integrative Medicine at Sandusky Wellness Center Integrative medicine is an all-encompassing form of healthcare. This method of caring for patients involves combining alternative types of care with mainstream methods. Practitioners of integrative medicine mix the conventional with the alternative to create a form of healthcare that focuses on the whole person, not just the disease or condition. Integrative medicine is often defined according to the following principles: - Fostering a partnership between the patient and practitioner. - Accounting for all factors that influence health and wellness beyond the disease, including aspects associated with the mind and spirit. - Combining conventional and alternative healthcare to promote healing. - Encouraging less-invasive treatments whenever possible. - Basing medicine on good science, meaning practices are inquiry-driven and open to criticism and new ideas. Adhering to each of these principles, the goal of integrative medicine programs is to address all aspects of a person's health. It strives to treat both immediate health needs and the effects and causes of the condition.

Ethical, Sound Integrative Medicine Programs It's a common myth that practitioners of integrative medicine are doing nothing more than peddling ineffective treatment and false hope. This belief glosses over that integrative medicine is, in fact, a recognized specialty by the American Board of Physician Specialties\u00ae (ABPS). Practitioners of integrative medicine can be certified by the American Board of Integrative Medicine (ABOIM). This organization posits ethical standards that certified physicians should adhere to. ABIOM-certified healthcare providers are expected to honor the ABPS Medical Code of Ethics and promote healthy living and illness prevention, both for their patients and for themselves. The practitioners of integrative medicine at Sandusky Wellness Center are highly trained in their field and are committed to providing the best care for each patient. A Wide Array of Integrative Medicine Programs Integrative medicine can come in several different forms.
