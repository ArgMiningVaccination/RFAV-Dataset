Are you looking to treat yourself to a private sound experience? Maybe you want to get a group of girlfriends together for a heart opening meditation? Or are you thinking that a meditation would be a great reset for your team at work? Perhaps you are building out a larger experience, party or event and want to incorporate a sound meditation... I have facilitated nearly 2,000 meditation experiences in the past 5 years playing in a diversity of spaces including well trafficked destinations such as the Lincoln Park Zoo or Chicago Botanic Gardens, private family homes, 80th floor wellness clubs, downtown conference rooms, universities, hospitals, outdoor venues, and many others. Don't have a place to host? No worries, I have access to a variety of rental spaces throughout the Chicago-land area. Are you putting together a larger experience, party, or event? No problem, the sound carries! (A sound system can be incorporated upon request w/additional charge) Each session begins with a brief introduction to sound meditation followed by the setting of intention. Next, you will take some deep breaths, get comfortable and open yourself up to the interaction of the instrument's frequencies with your body. Following the meditation there will be an opportunity to share your experience (optional) and ask questions. To receive the benefits, no skills, abilities, beliefs, or prior experience in meditation is required. So, what are you waiting for? Want to take a training course or buy an instrument? Every religion, spiritual practice, and indigenous group utilizes some form of sound frequency to unite people in ceremony, celebration, and healing. No matter where you travel, you'll find a rich culture of music and instruments that can often be traced back for thousands of years. We see gongs, singing bowls, didgeridoos, rattles, drums, bells, chimes, and the human voice. There's also decades of scientific research that shows how powerfully frequency impacts our overall physical, mental, and chemical state. Foundation in Vibration is a crystal bowl and meditation training for people who want to take control of their own well-being and be of service to others. The structure of the course has 3 parts: Let's Talk Vibration digs into Cymatics (the science of how frequencies interact), Altered States of Consciousness, and Intention. Vibration Creation is where you'll learn techniques for playing the bowls and basic elements of musical awareness such as dynamics, tempo, and consistency. Meditation Facilitation covers the responsibilities of a facilitator and the responsibilities of someone receiving the meditation when you're playing singing bowls to help others. The goal of meditation is not to quiet your mind, but to explore yourself at the deepest levels. Developing an understanding of frequency, the fundamental building block of the universe, and how frequency impacts our minds and bodies, can open us up to a world of possibilities and new understandings about our health, how we are affected by those around us, and how we can support the needs of those closest to us. Whether you're a complete beginner or a seasoned musician or meditator, you'll leave this training feeling confident using crystal bowls for your own meditation and for facilitating crystal bowl meditation for others. It's also one of the most affordable sound training programs of this depth being offered anywhere. Dive into the world of frequency, meditation, and crystal bowls and learn how to utilize these techniques to create more inner peace and physical and emotional health in your life (and in the lives of others.) The instructor, Jay Taylor, has facilitated over 1,300 sound meditation experiences in the Chicagoland area, and is the director and co-founder of the Ahimsa School of Sound Healing. Previous to his work in sound, Jay had a 10-year teaching career working with students with special needs. \"If I had to trace my decision to become a meditation facilitator to one event, it's the time I was monitoring 1st grade recess and two kids ran into each other. One of the boys was screaming, and I ran up to him and asked if I could play him my tuning fork. With his permission I brought the fork to his ear, and he instantly stopped screaming and became calm. A moment later he was back to playing. The power of sound to change lives, shift perspectives, and unite people became very clear in that moment. It's for that reason that I created this course and have dedicated my life to sharing the power of sound with as many people as possible.\" \u2014 Jay Taylor Requirements: To participate in the course you must have access to a Crystal Singing Bowl. If you choose to purchase a bowl through the Ahimsa School of Sound Healing you will receive 10% off your first purchase as a student.

Get the most out of your meditation with 5 easy steps: Prepare your space by adjusting the lighting and temperature and communicating with the people around you that you should not be disturbed. Select a recording from below, put on headphones, and press play. Close your eyes and connect with your breathing. Set a present tense based intention regarding the purpose of your practice. Examples: My intention is to be in a deep state of relaxation. My intention is to process the emotions I am suppressing. My intention is that my lower back is healthy and whole. Know that whatever comes up is perfect and needs to be experienced. There are not bad meditators. Meditation is valuable regardless of the perception of your experience.
