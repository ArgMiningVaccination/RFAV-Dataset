Toxins in foods and the environment, poor diet and stress can all contribute to a decline in immunesystem activity. If your immune function is weakened, your body is subject to fatigue and illness and cannot ward of infections. Immunesystem cells are produced by the thymus gland, the spleen and other organs. They are then carried through the body via the lymph vessels to the lymph nodes, which store these cells and he help to create an effective barrier against infection. Immune cells can be damaged by unstable oxygen molecules in the body called free radicals which may be generated in dangerously high numbers by poor nutrition, X rays, alcohol, cigarette smoke and pollutants. Vitamins help strengthen the immune system by neutralizing these celldamaging particles. Exercise, too, helps maintain good health by promoting blood circulation and ensuring a plentiful of oxygen throughout the body. What You Can Do Many factors play a role in strengthening the immune system: A balanced diet, rich in vitamins and minerals, provides the building blocks for healthy cells. Deep breathing and fresh air replenish vital oxygen. Regular exercise boosts oxygen intake and helps build cardiovascular and immunesystem health. Protect cells with vitamins Vitamins C and E known as anti-oxidants stimulate immunity and protect against cancer by neutralizing free radicals. Vitamin A also helps strengthen immune cells. The daily requirement is 1,000 RE (found in 1 carrot) for vitamin A, 60 mg. (1 orange) for vitamin C and 810 mg. (2 tbsp. vegetable oil) for vitamin E. Gain fresh energy with oxygen Engage in moderate exercise for an hour a day to ensure plentiful intake of fresh air. This promotes oxygen exchange between blood and air and speeds metabolism, leading to efficient mobilization of energy from nutrients. Strengthen your thymus gland The thymus gland, which is located in the upper part of the chest behind the breastbone, is a nursery for immune system cells that help fight infection. Unfortunately, this organ shrinks in size as we grow older, and its effectiveness gradually diminishes. Here's a quick and easy exercise to stimulate your thymus gland and boost your immunesystem health: Every morning, tap on the middle of the breastbone with your fingers for 5 minutes. Boosting the Immune System Acupuncture treatment and Traditional Chinese Medicine Research shows that acupuncture treatments can increase the body's T-cell count, as well as the number of cells that ingest and destroy bacteria, protozoa, and cell debris. A study shows that white blood cell counts and mobility have increased by 168 percent within three hours after treatment. Hot and cold showers Begin your morning with a warm shower. After a few minutes, step aside and change the water temperature to lukewarm or cold. Place your right leg back in the shower first then work your way up the body. Stress reduction Scientific studies have shown that stress weakens your immunity. Try relaxation techniques, such as yoga or meditation, to help you cope better with stress. Or brew up some lindenflower or valerian tea to help relieve anxiety and reinstate a state of calm.

Herbal immune stimulants Immune cocktail: Put 3 carrots, 1 orange, 1 apple and half a beet through a juicer. Make a fresh batch of this drink every day.
