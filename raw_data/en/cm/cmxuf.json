This follows careful review of the safety data by the MHRA and advice from the government's independent Commission on Human Medicines. A temporary suspension of the 15-minute observation period for children aged 5-11 years remains in place and this will be reviewed on a regular basis. A temporary suspension will also apply for infants and children aged 6 months to 5 years, should this age group be included in the vaccination programme.

Information about the Spikevax vaccine (formerly COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna), approved by the MHRA on 8 January 2021. The Summary of Product Characteristics is a description of a medicinal product's properties and the conditions attached to its use. It explains how to use and prescribe a medicine. It is used by healthcare professionals, such as doctors, nurses and pharmacists. The Patient Information Leaflet provides information for patients on using the medicine safely. This is based on the Summary of Product Characteristics of the product. The Public Assessment Report (PAR) is a scientific report, written by the MHRA. It explains how this product was assessed and how its authorisation was recommended, as well as its conditions of use. It is not intended to provide practical advice on how to use this product. The Marketing Authorisation (MA) granted by the MHRA is valid in Great Britain only and was approved via the [European Commission (EC) Decision Reliance Route](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/european-commission-ec-decision-reliance-procedure). This is when the marketing authorisation application made by the company references the decision made by the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The MHRA reviews this application, together with due consideration of the EC decision, before making an independent decision on the quality, safety, and effectiveness of the vaccine. Spikevax is authorised in Northern Ireland under the MA granted by the EMA on 6 January 2021. This MA has similar requirements to that granted by the MHRA.
