On the onset, the concept may seem like a lot to process. How does it help with traumas? What do I expect from the experience? Before my very first encounter with this practice, I asked: \"Will I have to conjure any spirits or ghosts?\" Even in the age of Google where information is so easily accessed and consumed, mysticism and occultism are common misconceptions surrounding Shamanism. This has to do with its deep roots in ancient times that go beyond the birth of religion. In truth, it is no different from yoga. It recommends a path for living instead of being affixed on doctrine or dogma. Shamanism can cut across religions and cultures, the same way that a devout Catholic may choose to practice Vinyasa or go into regular meditation. They are also similar in the sense that its various forms and philosophies are time-honored. In fact, some studies published by the University of Minnesota writes: \"Many formalized religions, from Buddism to Christianity, came from ancient shamanic roots and still bear the shamanic threads of deep connection to the divine in all things.\" INTRODUCTION TO SHAMANIC ENERGY HEALING Sabrina Villard, whose energy healing practice is anchored on her shamanic lineage begins: \"I usually call my sessions 'therapy for lazy people.' No work required, just relax and allow me to guide you. You just need to be ready to face yourself and evolve.\" Sessions with Sabrina can be booked via [Balance Health ](https://balancehealth.com.hk/)or through her platform, [VHealing](https://www.v-healing.org/). They can be facilitated in-person or through Zoom. She explains that even from a distance, she could access one's energy field to clear, balance and remove blockages. Sabrina details, \"My shamanic healing practice focuses on shedding light on the root or source of any emotional traumas or blockages to help you step forward in life.\" THREE-PHASES OF ENERGY HEALING The 45-minute encounter, puts mind and body was in a meditative state. Deep drums, Brazilian, African, Arabic and Peruvian music takes senses on a journey. The only job, when engaging in an energy healing session, is to lay back, relax and welcome restoration. Sabrina queues, \"I will work by connecting to your energy field. This way I can find where the blockages and remove them. The goal is to clear and rebalance your energy.\" The first phase feels a lot like walking into a technicolor dream, while being fully aware of the present. There is an indescribable sense of lightness when Sabrina closes the first phase. Clearing and balancing is followed by dialogue and finally, a mutual agreement to embark on a healing journey. This holistic approach in energy healing allows one to tap into both the tangible and invisible for optimum results. Sabrina affirms, \"To reach our fullest and highest potential, we must address and attend to all parts of ourselves. This is a lot like conventional therapy, except Ill be doing all the talking.\" During the exchange, Sabrina identifies blockage points, relating them to various concerns like childhood and traumas. She further explains how and why joints in our body also function as emotional storage rooms. For example, when we feel stressed or anxious, it is usually manifested through upper back or neck pains. She further explains, \"We work on the energetic, emotional, physical and spiritual levels. All this is wrapped up with open-heart communication. Voicing things out is very important to bring down your thoughts to something that is more concrete.\" ENERGY HEALING THAT COMBINES REIKI, ACUPUNCTURE AND SHAMANISM During one of our chats, Sabrina reveals details of her Bedouin Shaman lineage \"My grandmother was a shaman,\" she intimates. \"Discovering my shamanic roots, gave me a fresh perspective on life and happiness. This is also why I deliver messages in simplest way possible, always aiming for the root and removing all superficial layers.\" Sabrina has been an energy healer since 2015, practicing level 3 Reiki. She is also a trained clinical acupuncturist, which lends expertise on the body and how it stores energy. She declares, \"There is no magic but only a willingness to put in the work. One must believe that the magic is within. A shaman only provides guidance.\" BREATHING INTO WELLNESS It's been almost a year since my first Shamanic Breathwork experience with [NAFAS JOURNEYS.](https://www.nafas.life/) Headed by Faciliator and Ordained Shamanic Minister, Walid Abounaga, it remains to be one of the most intense and powerful healing experiences I've ever immersed in. It was upon the invitation of dear friend, founder of wellness platform [RESONANCE](https://www.livewithresonance.com/activities), and recently ordained Shamanic minister, Malou Araneta, that I came to know about breathwork. And truth be told, the first session was a beautiful medley of fear turned into pure elation. GOING INTO AN ALTERED STATE Walid begins, \"This modality fascinated me more than any other technique. For the first time, I was able to connect with spirits, travel into different realms and enter different dimensions beyond the 3D world we live in.\" Connected circular breaths accompanied by binaural or chakra-attuned beats opens doors for an expanded state of awareness. Before every breathwork session Walid explains, \"The ego resides in that small window between inhaling and exhaling. Through circular breaths we let go of the ego.\" This breathing technique also saturates the mind, allowing for it to go into a safe, naturally-induced transcendental state. Minutes into my session, an electric current built up from my feet, moving all through my limbs. I also began to feel light-headed and cold. Truth be told, as a first time breather with type A personality, it caused panic and momentary fear. But after that, the journey revealed profound lessons on trust and being courageous in exploring the unknown. If at all, transcending initial fear was in itself a breakthrough. A JOURNEY UNLIKE ANY OTHER As soon as I let go of the fear and panic, a sensorial journey unlike any I've had commenced. There were colored lights similar to how I imagined the Northern Lights would look\u2014except amplified. My journey took me deep into the woods with figures that I identified as my spirit and animal guide. This later progressed to sensations and visuals that effect the experience of flying over oceans and above mountains. In between, I cried happy tears and sighed out sadness. Ironically, it's when we go into an altered state that we are rooted back into our true nature and essence\u2014where ego and experience are completely stripped off. And because the healing happens during an altered state, blockages, traumas and pain that hide deep within in our subconscious are tapped, acknowledged and ultimately, released. Walid expounds, \"There are many different Shamanic practices used to enter altered states from drumming, chanting, twirling, and of course, breathing. Those who benefit are the ones who come in with a conscious intention. Truly believe in the practice. Trust the shaman. Join with an open heart and an open mind.\" Malou furthers, \"This is a powerful healing modality. Through this process, breathers are able to release any trapped emotions or traumas and allows greater access to love, bliss, healing and transformation. This technique can lead to an overall improvement on physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional well-being.\" RETURNING TO EARTH Shamanic breathwork can be intense, and learning to reintegrate back into real life may require a few moments to absorb and process. For others, open discussion and creative expression help with the healing process. During my past sessions, breathwork was followed by recalibration activities facilitated by Malou. \"You can draw images like a mandala or write down words the describe your experience,\" she would always message before every breathwork session. Participants are also encouraged to share, although this is not mandatory. I've only ever spoken up once during integration, and if anything it has further amplified the feeling of being restored. WE ALL NEED HEALING AND WE ARE ALL SHAMANS \"We are all shamans. We are all healers with capacities to heal. By empowering yourself to navigate through tough challenges of life... you'll learn to deal with critical situations presented in life,\" expresses Walid. Through NAFAS Journeys, he has also organized several transformative travel experiences that has enabled other to immerse in healing and self-discovery. Also referred to as \"adventures for the soul\" trips organized by NAFAS takie place in various destinations including Peru, Bali or Sri Lanka. These curated experience, guided by Walid, allow participants, to reconnect with nature, body, spirit, breath and self. For Malou, the impact of shamanic breathwork was profound. She learned about this technique through NAFAS JOURNEYS at the peak of lockdowns. Soon after, she dove deep into the practice. Malou is now a certified Shamanic Minister, who will facilitate her first shamanic breathwork session on August 8 through RESONANCE. This coincides with Lion's Gate Portal, which is said to usher in potent energies that support change and manifesting. Sabrina, whose sessions have helped countless corporate executives and urban individuals leading fast-paced lives concludes, \"Everyone can benefit from Shamanic healing. You don't have to be religious, spiritual or a yogi or practice meditation to benefit from this.\" Whether at a crossroads, burdened by trauma, troubled by blockages, puzzled by life or simply curious and looking to enhance wellness, shamanic healing brings forth long term wellness benefits.
