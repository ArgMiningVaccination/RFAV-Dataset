Hitchman, Lukas Tribelhorn, Sarah Geber, Thomas N. Friemel Department of Communication and Media Research, University of Zurich, 15 Andreasstrasse, 8050, Switzerland Short title: Reasons for not getting COVID- 19 vaccine in Switzerland Keywords: vaccine hesitancy, COVID -19, vaccine confidence, public health, health communication Page 2 Summary Background: Several research studies have examined the reasons why people are hesitant to be vaccinated against COVID -19. However, there is no published data to date on Switzerland. Identifying these reasons among the Swiss population who are vaccine hesit ant may help inform campaigns to encourage vaccine confidence. Aims: The primary aim of this study is to identify the reasons for not getting vaccinated against COVID -19 among Swiss residents who are vaccine hesitant . The secondary aim is to examine whether reasons differ by age, gender , education, and likelihood of accepting a vaccination to better target campaigns and design interventions . Design: An online survey asked participants to indicate the reasons why they were hesitant to be vaccinated against COVID -19. Setting: German- speaking Swiss Cantons , the survey was administered online between 5 May 2021 and 16 May 2021. Participants: The participants in this analysis were a sample of (N=1191) Swiss residents age 16- 60 years old from German- speaking Cantons , who could answer an online survey in German, who had yet not been vaccinated, who had not yet registered for a vaccination appointment, and who did not indicate that they would definitely be vacc inated if offered the chance. Findings: Among people who are vaccine hesitant in Switzerland, the most common reasons for being hesitant were side -effect, safety, and effectiveness concerns. It was also common for people to indicate that they were healthy/ at low risk, would decide later, and that they wanted to build immunity naturally. Less common, but still prevalent concerns included wanting more information, thinking COVID -19 was not a real threat, and concerns that the vaccine may serve another purpose. Differences in reasons for being vaccin e hesitant were found by age, gender, education, and likelihood of accepting a vaccination if offered. Conclusions: To increase the likelihood of accepting a vaccination, vaccination campaigns should address side-effect, safety , and effectiveness concerns. Campaigns could also consider informing people why it is necessary for people in lower risk groups to be vaccinated, and why vaccination is preferable to infection for building immunity. While campaigns may be effective in reaching some of the population, alternative strategies might be necessary to strengthen the trust relationship with vaccines and vaccine providers in some groups. Less prevalent concerns, such as not liking needles, could be addressed through individual level interventions. Page 3 Introduction COVID -19 vaccinat ion intentions are lower in Switzerland than in other comparable countries [1]. In addition to other public health measures, such as effective contact tracing [2], it will be important to increase vaccination rates , as preventive measures to control the pandemic are relaxed, and the threat of variants of concern continues , for example, the Delta variant [3-5]. Previous research has found that reasons for being hesitant to be vaccinated against COVID -19 in other countries include: concerns around effectiveness and safety, already having had COVID -19, concerns about the newness of vaccine, religious beliefs, lack of trust, not liking needles, not believing that COVID -19 is a risk, a preference for building natural immunity, being against vaccines in general, and belief in conspiracy theor ies [5-9]. A weekly representative survey of the Swiss population conducted at same time as this study estimate d that the number of adults 16-80 who are undecided or say that it is unlikely that they would accept a vaccination is approximately 19% (week starting 17 May 2021) [6]. Among people who are vaccine hesitant in Switzerland, t his short report examines 1) the reasons that people 16-60 years old in German- speaking Switzerland give for being hesitant to be vaccinated against COVID -19, and 2) differences in the reasons by a) age, b) gender, c) education, and d) likelihood of accepting a vaccination. The focus is on this 'working age' population because these questions were included within an online survey concerned with vaccine hesitancy in younger age groups. Methods Procedures Reasons for being vaccin e hesitant were asked within an online survey . The online survey asked several questions about COVID -19 generally, COVID -19 vaccination specifically , and additionally tested COVID -19 vaccin ation campaign messa ges. This re port focuses only on questions about reasons for vaccine hesitancy. Participants were given written information about the study online and indicated consent by clicking yes to participation. The survey lasted approximately 20 minutes and was administered b etween 5 May 2021 and 16 May 2021. LINK transferred anonymized data to the researchers. Because one portion of the online survey randomised participants to be exposed to three different COVID -19 vaccination poster campaign messages, we checked if the poster message they were exposed to was associated with the reasons they gave. However, t here were no significant differences between the groups by the poster they were exposed to (Person's Chi squared test p<0.05) . Thus, the poster that they were exposed to was unlikely to have affected the reasons given. Sample. Participants were recruited from the LINK Internet -panel [7]. Briefly, t he panel consists of 115, 000 members who were recruited ac tively by LINK in telephone surveys (mobile and landline) including random digit dialling and thereby covering 98% of the Swiss population. We set age and gender quotas for sampling based on the Swiss population. . A total of N=3858 participant s accepted the invitation , after reading study information, n=43 did not consent , leading to a total of n=3815 to be screened for eligibility. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the present analysis were: 16- 60 years old, Page 4 not vaccinated, not yet register ed to be vaccinated, and not willing to be vaccinated in any case if given the chance. Measures. Reasons for not wanting to be vaccinated and vaccination intentions Reasons for not wanting to be vaccinated. Participants were asked to indicate the reasons that they were hesitant to be vaccinated against COVID -19. The list contained 17 different reasons based on previous research [8-12]. \"Other reason,\" was also an option, and had an open- text field to write in responses. The order that the reasons appeared in the list were randomised for each participant with the exception of \"other\" which was always listed last. Participants were instructed to select all reason s that applied. The full list of reasons is listed in English and the original German in Appendix 1. Likelihood of accepting a COVID -19 vaccination: Participants answered on a 7- point Likert scale (1=under no circumstances vaccinate, 7=vaccinate in any cas e) to the following question: \"How likely is it that you would choose to have a C OVID -19 vaccination in the coming week if you had the chance?\" The variable was recoded into three levels of likelihood of accepting a vaccination: very unlikely (scores 1 and 2), rather unlikely (scores 3 and 4), and likely (scores 5 and 6). Participants indicating 7 ( would vaccinate in any case) were not asked about reasons for not vaccinating and were excluded. Demographic characteristics Gender . Participants were asked, \"Are you, female, male, or other?\" Participants who select ed other could write in an answer. One participant who wrote in \"other\" was removed from the analys es on gender differences but was in cluded in all other analyses . Age. Participants were asked, \"What is your age?\" Participants entered their age numerically. Age was grouped as: 16- 30, 31 -45, and 46- 60. Education. Participants were asked, \"What is the highest education level that you have completed with a certificate or diploma?\" Response options included : 1) no compulsory school , 2) compulsory school, 3) \"Haushaltslehrjahr, \" or \" Handelsschule\" , 4) (short) Apprenticeship, 5) Diploma school or secondary technical school, 6) Vocational apprenticeship, 7) Vocational schools, 8) Upper secondary schools, or 9) University or tertiary education. There is no common international equivalent of \"Haushaltslehrjahr \" or \"Handelsschule,\" this schooling involves basic training in running a home or business. These were grouped as: 1- 3 = Low; 4- 8 = Medium; 9 = High to understand participant characteristics. For analyses purposes , the low and medium groups were combined due to small numbers in the low education group. Analys es All analyses wer e conducted in R version 4.0.4. Sample sizes and percentages presented are unweighted. Unweighted Pearson's Chi-square d Tests were used to test differences in the reasons supported by age, gender, education, and vaccine confidence, with Yates' continuity c orrection for the education and gender analyses (binary variables ). We ran several Chi-square d tests leading to the possibility that s ome of the differences found may be due to multiple testing (chance findings) . A more Page 5 cautious interpretation could adjust the p-value to conclude that differences may exist, e.g., p<0.003 using the Bonferroni correction for each Table of results. The responses of the participants who provided \"other \" reasons for not getting vaccinated were analysed qualitatively. Responses were first read over by the researchers. A simple coding frame of reasons was generated inductively . Responses were then iteratively sorted into the coding frame . These codes were then sorted into broader factors to allow them to be summarised. Results Participant s The study focuses on people who are vaccine hesitant in Switzerland. This sample was arrived at as follows . Of the n=3815 participants who gave consent to participate , n=67 were over the age of 60 and were excluded, n=3748 went on to indicate vaccination status, n=1459 were excluded because they had already received at least one vaccine dose, leaving a sample of n=2289. For this analysis, we further excluded n=1022 participants who had already registered to be va ccinated, but had not yet been vaccinated, leaving n=1267. Reasons for being vaccine hesitant were then only asked among people who did not say they would vaccinate in any case, e.g., scores 1 -6 on likelihood of accepting a vaccination, excluding scores of 7 (n=76) participants, leaving a final sample size of n=1191. All participants gave an answer to each of the relevant questions, thus there was no missing data. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the current study participants , the initial sample charac teristics from which the sample was drawn (N=3748), and the prevalence of the characteristics in the Swiss population. Most participant s of the current study were 46 -60, female, had a medium level of education, and tended towards a low likelihood of accepting a vaccination. Note that the sample characteristics reflect the inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., p articipants not yet registered to be vaccinated, and who would not vaccinate in any case ), and the initial study sample (N=3748) from which t he sample for the current study was drawn (N=1191 ). Compared to the general Swiss population females, and older age groups were overrepresented in the initial sample. Therefore, the characteristics of the analy sed sample should not be used as a basis for i nferences on the sociodemographic characteristics of people who are vaccine hesitant. [Table 1 here] Main findings The number and percent of participants who indicated each r eason for being hesitant to get vaccinated against COVID -19 are shown in Table 2. The most common reasons for not vaccinating were side- effect, safety, and effectiveness concerns. Belief that they were healthy and not at risk, wanting to build immunity naturally, and saying they would decide later w ere also common reasons . Less prevale nt concerns included, not trusting authorities, believing COVID -19 was not a real threat, believing the vaccines served another purpose, wanting more information, and being against vaccination in general. Fewer participants indicated that they had already had COVID -19, that they did not like needles/injections, and that the vaccine was not compatible with their health conditions. Very few p articipants indicated not having enough time or religious concerns. [Table 2 here] Page 6 Age differences in reasons for not getting vaccinated against COVID -19. See Table 3 for results. A higher percentage of older participants (46-60 years old ) indicated that they did not want to get vaccinated against COVID -19 because they had safety concerns about the vaccine, had health conditions it was not compatible with, wanted to build immunity naturally, were against vaccination generally, were concerned the vaccines served another purpose, and did not trust the authorities advising it. A higher percentage of younger pa rticipants (16-30) reported not wanting to get vaccinated because they need ed more information , and because they did not like needles/injections . [Table 3 here] Gender differences in reasons for not getting vaccinated against COVID -19. See Table 4 for res ults. A higher percentage of m ales than females report ed that they did not want to get vaccinate d because they believ ed that COVID -19 was not a real threat, did not like needles/injections, believe d enough other people w ould get vaccinated, and did not trust the authorities advising it. A higher percentage of females than males report ed not wanting to be vaccinated because they had concerns about vaccine effectiveness. [Table 4 here] Education differences in reasons for not getting vaccinated agains t COVID -19. See Table 5 for results. A higher percentage of participants with low/moderate education than high education report ed that they did not want to get vaccinated because they had concerns about side -effects, believed that enough other people w ould get vaccinated, and had concerns that the vaccine serves another purpose. [Table 5 here] Likelihood of accepting a vaccination differences in reasons for not getting vaccinated against COVID - 19. See Table 6 for results. There were differences in reasons for not getting vaccinated by likelihood of accepting a vaccination for every reason except for already having had COVID -19 and not liking needles/injections. Briefly, among those who are very unlikely to accept a vaccine, safety, side -effect, and effectiveness concerns were very high along with believing they were healthy and at low risk, wanting to build immunity naturally, not trusting the authorities advising it, having concerns that the vaccines serve another purpose, and being against vaccination generally . Those rather unlikely to accept a vaccine more often reported needing more information, and saying they would decide later. Participants likely to accept a vacci nation still had concerns (e.g., safety, side-effect, and effectiveness), but overall a lower percentage endorsed each reason for not vaccinating. [Table 6 here] Other r easons for not vaccinating. Based on the analys is of the open text responses , we grouped the other reasons given into five factors : 1) lack of long- term research, 2) effectiveness concerns, 3) mistrust , rumours and misperceptions about vaccines , 4) belief that they are healthy and risk is low, and 5) pre -existing conditions, and practical factors . 1) Lack of long- term research: The other reasons that participants wrote in for not vaccinating overwhelmingly included concerns about the long- term effects of vaccination and the speed of vaccine development. Of the participants indicating these reasons, several expressed explicit concerns about the newness of mRNA vaccines , with a few saying they would get vaccinated with a non- mRNA vaccine. 2) Effectiveness concerns: various effectiveness concerns were common, there was confusion over whether getting vaccinated would prevent them from transmitting COVID -19 to others , worries that the vaccine would only offer Page 7 protection for a short period of time, that mutations would lead to changes in effectiveness , and that unwanted annual vaccinations would be necessary. 3) Mistrust, ru mours and misperceptions about vaccines: Several participants gave reasons that expressed a lack of trust in vaccines, and a belief in rumours and misperceptions , such that the vaccines were only to make money, that they could cause infertility, that breas tfeeding prevented vaccination [13], and that COVID -19 was a hoax. 4) Belief that they are healthy and not at risk: Several participants felt that they were not personally at risk , and that their immune system was strong enough . 5) Pre-existing conditions and pra ctical factors: Allergies, auto- immune disorders and pregnancy were given as reasons for not vaccinating, along with trouble booking an appointment by a few participants. It should be noted that the option for pregnant women to be vaccinated under certain conditions was introduced in Switzerland shortly after this survey was conducted [14]. Discussion Health behaviour theories describe how health protective behaviour s can be motivated by perceived risk of the protective behaviour and the threat itself, and the effectiveness of the behav iour in protecting against the risk [15]. In line with these behaviour al theories, t he results show th e most common reasons for being vaccine hesitant are the perceived risks of the vaccination, including side - effects and safety concerns . This finding is similar to previous research on vaccine confidence in Switzerland that suggests there are relatively high concerns about vaccine safety [16]. Vaccine effectiveness was an additional common concern, which aligns with behavioural theories as well . Low perceived risk s of COVID -19 were also common reason s for being vaccine hesitant (e.g., feeling at low risk, wanting to build immunity naturally, and thinking that COVID -19 is not a real threat). Not trusting the authorities advising the vaccine and concern the vaccines may serve another purpose, although less common, were further prevalent reason s. In addition to alignment with health behaviour theories, these findings align with research on the \"trust relationship\" with vaccines, where trust of the product (vaccine) , trust in the provider (health professional), and the trust of the political /system (authority) are important components of the vaccine decision making process [17]. There were several differences in the reasons supported by age, gender, education, and likelihood of accepting a vaccination, we discuss the most notable differences here. Age differences included a higher number of participants in older age groups who endorsed reasons such as wanting to build immunit y natural ly, and the higher number of young people wanting more information. Age differences may be due to older groups hav ing been eligible longer for the vaccines, and older people not yet vaccinated or registered to be vaccinated likely have lower vacci ne confidence than younger groups. For gender, there w as a higher number of males who said enough other people would get vaccinated. Males were also more likely to endorse that COVID -19 was not a real threat, and that they did not like needles/injections. There were few differences by education, notably lower education groups were more likely to endorse the concern that the vaccines may serve another purpose as a reason . Not surprisingly, the largest differences in the reasons given were by likelihood of accepting a vaccination. For example, in our analyses participants with the lowest likelihood of accepting a vaccine more often reported wanting to build immunity naturally, not trusting the authorities who advised the vaccine, and believ ing COVID -19 was not a real threat, alongside their concerns about vaccine safety, side -effects, and effectiveness. For participants who were rather unlikely to accept a vaccine , alongside their concerns about vaccine safety, side -effects, and effectivenes s, a higher number than other groups said they would decide later , and that they wanted more information. For participants with the highest likelihood of accepting a vaccine among our vaccine hesitant sample, concerns about vaccine safety, side -effects, an d effectiveness remained, with high numbers also reporting that they were healthy and not at risk and would decide later. Page 8 Several reasons for not vaccinating were identified in the \"other\" open- text response s. Reasons that differed from the ones we asked about in the survey included specific concerns about the long- term effects of the vaccines, and speed at which the vaccines were developed. There was also concern and confusion around how long the vaccines would be effective for, whether this would c hange due to mutants, and the necessity of annual vaccination. Overall, the reasons written in the other responses mirrored the major concerns we found in the quantitative data, such that side- effects, safety, and effectiveness concerns were the most common. Limitations: The study was only conducted among the Swiss -German speaking regions, and only among 16- 60 year olds. While this may limit generalisability to other areas of Switzerland and older people, this is still an important target group. When restr ictions lift, the population 16- 60 years old, many whom will be working or attending education, will begin moving and interacting with others more, potentially spreading the virus. Another limitation is that this study was conducted within a study testing three different poster campaign messages . However, we found no difference in the reasons for vaccine hesitancy by the poster campaign message that participants were expos ed to. Additionally, one of the posters (control condition) was similar to messages in the current live campaign in Switzerland . Thus, most people would have already seen a similar message to the control . Conclusions We have identified key reasons for not getting vaccinated amongst people in Switzerland who remain hesitant to be vaccinated against COVID -19. These reasons differ by, age, gender, education, and likelihood of accepting a vaccination. Future vaccination media campaigns and interventions will need to take into consideration that people who remain vaccine hesitant in Switzerland have concerns that will likely need to be addressed by building trust in COVID -19 vaccines , and increasing the belief that COVID -19 is a serious threat. Younger age groups, who currently are less likely to report not trusting authorities and related reasons, may benefit from targeted information and prompts to get vaccinated.
