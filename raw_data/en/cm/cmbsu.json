Summer Detoxification Program Effective Very well tolerated Easy to use Detoxification Why? Over the last 20 years, the number of people suffering from allergies and chronic diseases has increased considerably. Allergies and chronic diseases are always accompanied by an impaired immune system. Proper functioning of the immune system can be negatively influenced by metabolic disorders, pollution (ie. by the air or amalgam), an unbalanced diet, or increasing age. The body's excretion pathways may be able to counteract these negative influences for a time, but become over taxed by long-term exposure. This leads to a build-up of toxic substances through out the body with far-reaching consequences. This is a deep detoxification program based on homotoxicology. Detoxing can help support you with: Poor general health Allergies Obesity/Weight issues Infertility Skin disorders After exposure to pollutants Length of Detox Program? 4 - 6 weeks Chronic disorders & ongoing health problems The Detoxification Rejuventation Program is a comprehensive evaluation of your health and includes testing and ongoing detoxification to support your best health outcomes.
