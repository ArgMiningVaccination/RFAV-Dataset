We will start with ceremonial cacao to prime your body, mind and soul to prepare for you to bask in the healing sound vibrations. Britt is a Shamanic Practitioner, Ceremonialist and Intuitive. She loves bringing the community together for healing, as it amplifies the healing everyone receives as well as connection. She has a practice in Holly Springs and offers many different modalities of healing, including Cacao Ceremonies, as cacao is such a beautiful facilitator of natural heart opening compounds, increasing the energetic field of your heart! Cacao helps us all to experience an elevation in mood, a deeper connection, enhanced intuition and to be more open and more heart centered. Jenny Aiello is a Life Coach who practices in Raleigh, NC. She and her husband Bob, a psychologist, enjoy bringing their intuitive and healing energy into the world through sound healing. Using a variety of instruments from drums, Native American flutes, sound bowls, chimes, and more... they harness a specific combination of sound vibrations and frequencies to move brain waves from the active beta state (busy mind), to alpha waves (relaxed) and then to the ultimate theta brain waves (deeply relaxed). Science has shown us that enormous healing occurs when we reach theta, our parasympathetic state. It is here that our bodies can release stored up trauma in nervous systems, open blood vessels, increase the efficiency of our cells, and regulate our blood pressure. Students maintain a deep level of relaxation while the vibrational frequency of sound entrains their energy centers to a place of balance. Please Note: If this is your first time with ceremonial cacao, and you are on antidepressants or are sensitive to stimulants, we will start you off on a homeopathic dose of 5mg and if you feel comfortable, we can increase your dose 5mg at a time. Ceremonial dose is 30-40mg. You can also opt for Cacao Tea, a great alternative made from the husk of the cacao bean with many of the same health benefits! Refrain from caffeine or alcohol 2-4 hours "}
