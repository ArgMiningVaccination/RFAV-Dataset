Adult Reviews - The Community Services Review (CSR) Unit initiated a targeted review of older adults receiving day rehabilitative treatment that began in July 2015. This population was chosen by DBH Adult Services staff to further e xplore the previous Applied Research and Evaluation (ARE) Unit data analysis findings that indicated older adults are the costliest users of day services. The CSR Unit focused review outcomes may:1) provide answers about the day services utilization cost r elationship for older adults; 2) uncover service needs for this demographic that are not obvious; and 3) inform behavioral health service planning for this population. Preliminary activities included reviewing the literature about older adults with psychia tric illness and day service utilization in order to generate focused questions to supplement the Quality Service Review for an Adult Participant: Field Use Version 1. While 87 consumers were identified only eight (8) met the sampling criteria . The review process involves obtaining their written consent and scheduling interviews with all members of their treatment team and key natural supports.

It began in October 2012 following the developmen t of a Strategic Plan supported by a SAMHSA System of Care (SOC) Planning grant and has now completed three (3) quarters of Year 3 implementation. The goals are addressed through five (5) focus areas and each integrates social marketing . They include: 1) improved access to mental health services; 2) parent and youth peer support; 3) functional assessment utilizing the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale (CAFAS) and the Preschool and Early Childhood Functional Assessment Scale (PECFAS) ; 4) inte gration of behavioral health and primary c are; and 5) reinvestment strategies to promote sustainability . A description of some of the initiatives follows. DC Mental Health Access Project (DC MAP) - DBH awarded a contract to Children's National Health Syste m in March 2015 to support ongoing development of behavioral health screening by primary care providers (pediatricians), that includes the DC MAP mental health consultation project. It provides pediatricians with immediate access to mental health and/or p sychiatric consultation as children/youth are identified as potentially needing behavioral health services. This project supports pediatricians in competently providing behavioral health care within their practice if appropriate or supports the timely link age to the right behavioral health services. The education of primary care providers through the learning collaborative also continues as well as educational presentations within the primary care provider's office. This contract also supports the developme nt of a psychiatric medication monitoring committee to the review children/youth prescribed multiple psychotropic medications. Collaboration Across Grants - The c ollaboration across the three (3) DBH grants (DC Gateway Project SOC grant, State Youth Treatment grant (SYT), and Now is the Time - Healthy Transitions grant (NITT - HT)) continues. The staff from all three (3) grants are District of Columbia Page 29 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 39 of 19429 actively involved with the youth driven work group developing the Yout h Peer Specialist training program. SYT and NITT -HT staff attend the SOC Management and Implementation/Roundtable meetings and a SYT Transition Age Youth (T AY) Council meeting includes DC Gateway Project staff. This combined advisory council has broad family and youth involvement along with various community organizations. The DC Gateway Project and the NITT Healthy Transitions Grant collaborated with youth Technical Assistance providers and Youth MOVE National to provide a youth \"kick -off\" in January 2015. At the M & I /Roundtable meeting the development of culturally appropriate behavioral health programming for the LG BTQI population was discussed. Now a work group is developing recommendations for serving LBGTQI TAY behavioral health needs and will be repo rting these recommendations to the SYT/TAY Council. CAFAS/PECFAS - The Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA) implemented the CAFAS/PECFAS for all children/youth in July 2015. This includes children in out -of- home care (foster care, group settings, psychi atric residential treatment facilities, and supervised return to the biological home), and children/youth who remain in their biological home but are receiving servic es and monitoring through CFSA. The Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services (DYRS) adm inisters the CAFAS when a Notice of Intent to Commit is filed and then administers it every 90 days for all committed youth. It is used in the quarterly Team Decision Making (TDM) meeting to identify needs for the plan of care and illustrate change and im provement over time. The Department of Human Services (DHS) utilizes the CAFAS for all youth actively enrolled in the Parent and Adolescent Support Services (PASS) and in the Alternatives to Court Experience (ACE) diversion program. DHS utilizes the CAFAS data to measure outcomes of both of these short -term programs. The Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) continues to utilize the CAFAS/PECFAS across all 25 c hild serving providers. Between January 1 and March 20, 2015, 2 ,123 assessments were completed an d from April 1 through June 22 , 2015, 1,952 assessments were done. The CAFAS/PECFAS total score is used to inform the types and quantity of services that are automatically approved for inclusion in the child/youth's plan of care. O. Transition Age Youth Initiatives: Youth and young adult initiatives are coordinated within the DBH Child and Youth Services Division by the Transition Age Youth Coordinator. Now Is The Time (NITT): Healthy Transitions: The purpose of this SAMHSA grant is to develop a system of care for transition age youth (TAY) and young adults. DBH is the lead agency for this initiative to design and implement a transition age youth (TAY) focused system of care in partnership with key District agencies (CFSA, DYRS, DCPS , Department of Employment Services), core service agencies (CSAs), community -based organizations, health care providers, and family and youth networks. This system of care, called the DC Transition Age Youth Initiative, is for ages 16 - 25 with services pr ovided by the DBH CSAs. They will provide TAY specific care planning, wraparound, evidence -based practices and recovery supports, and will employ Transition Specialists specifically trained to diagnose and assess TAY clients and provide customized, individ ual plans of care to successfully transition them to adulthood. The evidence -based and informed practices and recovery supports to be expanded during this initiative include: 1) a combined Transitions to Independence Process (TIP) and Assertive Community T reatment (ACT) program known as TACT; 2) Adolescent Community District of Columbia Page 30 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 40 of 19430 Reinforcement Approach (A -CRA); 3) Supported Employment; and 4) Supportive Housing. This Initiative will also broaden and improve outreach to, and early identification and screening of, TAY wi th mental health conditions, substance use disorders and co -occurring disorders. Initially the program will target youth, young adults and their families in Wards 7 and 8 (though not to the exclusion of TAY throughout the District) and lessons learned from these wards will be applied as the program systematically expands to other wards. Youth, young adults and their families will inform all aspects of the Initiative including planning, education, outreach and identification, social marketing, and evaluation , and transition age youth will be represented on the key oversight body for the initiative. Transition Age Youth Housing Initiative: On March 26, 2015, District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser and Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Brenda Donald opened Wayne Place, a transition age youth transitional housing facility. Wayne Place is the result of a partnership between DBH and the Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA) to help young men and women between the ages of 18 -24, who might otherwise be ho meless, build the skills they need to be self -sufficient. This initiative include s life skill training for youth and young adults who need support to live independently and succeed. Wayne Place, a complex of six (6) buildings with 22 two -bedroom apartments , provides the opportunity for 44 young people to live at this facility. Half of the beds are being utilized by youth linked to CFSA and half are linked to DBH. As of July 13, 2015, DBH interviewed 34 applicants and approved 20. CFSA reviewed 22 applicants and approved 17. A total of 56 applications were received and 37 (66%) were approved.

This initiative is part of the Mayor's effort to advance achievement and opportunity and reduce racial disparities for boys and men of color across the District. Currently, male stud ents of color (Afri can American and Latino boys) make up 43% of the overall DCPS student population and the se students as a whole are not meeting their potential. African American male students in particular have the lowest attendance and student satisfaction rates. In partnership with the White House's My Brother's Keeper effort, DCPS will use three (3) key strategies to address the urgent needs of male students of color: 1) mentoring, 2) targeted funding for grants to schools, and 3) a new all -male college preparato ry high school. Mentoring and Fostering a Love of Readin g- By fourth grade, nearly 50 % of African American and Latino males are reading below grade level. To launch this work, DCPS is recruiting 500 volunteers to serve as mentors to males of color throughout the District working to increase the percentage of males of color reading at grade level by the fourth grade. Through partnerships with Reading Partners and Literacy Lab, mentors will volunteer in schools on a weekly basis and help students impr ove their reading skills. Both Reading Partners and Literacy Lab have proven track records of success with DCPS students. The influx of volunteers will allow these organizations to expand their work in DCPS, help struggling readers and challenge exceptiona l readers . Targeted Funding to Schools - African American males are the least satisfied with school, with satisfaction rates 16 percentage points lower than the District's most satisfied students. Through this new initiative, DCPS will offer schools the opp ortunity to create initiatives for males of color to improve academics, as well as support their social and emotional needs. Schools will apply for grants through the \"Proving What's Possible\" model. The model will allow school leaders to decide what will work best for their school communities. These grants require schools to focus their efforts in one of three (3) areas: academic development, family engagement and social -emotional supports. New All -Male College Preparatory High School - Despite recent gains, African American and Latino males are still graduating at rates lower than their peers; 48% and 57%, respectively. In 2016, DCPS will open a new high school for males of color. Through a partnership with Urban Prep Academies, a highly successful net work of all - boys high schools in Chicago, DCPS plans to open the first Urban Prep school in the District. Among Urban Prep's many accomplishments, for five (5) consecutive years 100% of its graduates have been admitted to 4 -year colleges and universities. Urban Prep graduates, who come from similar circumstances and backgrounds as DCPS students, enroll and persist in college at rates higher than national averages for African American males.

The District's has one of the highest concentrations of GLBT residents in the country with an estimated 7 -10% of the population being GLBT. The Office of GLBT Affairs works in collaboration with an Advisory Committee, appointed by the Mayor, to define issues of concern to the GLBT community and find innovative ways of utilizing government resources to help address these issues. The office offers four (4) services: 1) capacity building; 2) outreach; 3) e ducation/ training p rograms ; and 4) technical assistance . The following resources are available to the GLBT community: 1) Directory of GLBT Organizations in the District of Columbia ; 2) Guide to Community Resources ; 3) GLBT Publications ; and 4) Employment Opportunities . District of Columbia Page 42 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 52 of 194Planning Steps Step 2: Identify the unmet service needs and critical gaps within the current system. Narrative Question: This step should identify the unmet services needs and critical gaps in the state's current systems, as well as the data sour ces used to identify the needs and gaps of the populations relevant to each block grant within the state's behavioral health system, especially for th ose required populations described in this document and other populations identified by the state as a priority. This step should also add ress how the state plans to meet these unmet service needs and gaps. The state's priorities and goals must be supported by a data -driven process. This could include data and information that are available through the state's unique data system (including community -level data), as well as SAMHSA's data set including, but not limited to, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS), the National Facilities Surveys on Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services , the annual State and National Behavioral Health Barometers , and the Uniform Reporting System (URS). Those states that have a State Epidemiological and Outcomes Workgroup (SEOW) should describe its composition and contribution to th e process for primary prevention and treatment planning. States should also continue to use the prevalence formulas for adults with SMI and children with SED, as well as the prevalence estimates, epidemiological analyses, and profiles to establish mental health treatment, substa nce abuse prevention, and substance abuse treatment goals at the state level. In addition, states should obtain and include in their da ta sources information from other state agencies that provide or purchase behavioral health services. This will allow states to have a m ore comprehensive approach to identifying the number of individuals that are receiving behavioral health services and the services they are rec eiving. SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Barometer is intended to provide a snapshot of the state of behavioral health in America. This report presents a set of substance use and mental health indicators measured through two of SAMHSA's populations - and treatment facility -based survey data collection efforts, the NSDUH and the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) and other relevant data sets. Collected and reported annually, these indicators uniquely position SAMHSA to offer both an overview reflecting the behaviora l health of the nation at a given point in time, as well as a mechanism for tracking change and trends over time. It is hoped that the Nation al and State specific Behavioral Health Barometers will assist states in developing and implementing their block grant programs. SAMHSA will provide each state with its state -specific data for several indicators from the Behavioral Health Barometers . States can use this to compare their data to national data and to focus their efforts and resources on the areas where they need to improve. In addi tion to in -state data, SAMHSA has identified several other data sets that are available to states through various federal agencies: CMS, the A gency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and others. Through the Healthy People Initiative18 HHS has identified a broad set of indicators and goals to track and improve the nation's health. By using the indicators included in Healthy People, states can focus their efforts on priority issues, support consistency in me asurement, and use indicators that are being tracked at a national level, enabling better comparability. States should consider this resource in their planning. 18 http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/default.aspx Footnotes: District of Columbia Page 1 of 5 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 53 of 194The two (2) initiatives below have been DBH priorities since the Department's inception on October 1, 2013. They require significant planning, system transformation, and development. 1. Health Homes: The District has long recognized the need for more integrated behavioral and physical care to improve the overall health status of individuals with serious mental illness. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) introduced the Health Home model as a systems approach to allow providers to coordinate and provide access for behavioral and primary health care to these vulnerable individuals. DBH (formerly DMH) determined that using the Health Home model would best enable the provider system to support these individuals in a sustainable and effective way in the community. The agency expects that implementation of Health Homes will lead to greater overall health and compliance with both behavioral and primary care ,which will in turn lead to fewer hospitalizations and emergency room visits and an overall enhancement in the quality of life. 2. Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery Services DBH was created from the merger of the District's mental health and addiction systems (the Department of Mental Health and the Department of Health/Addiction Prevention and Recovery Administration/APRA). At that time DOH/APRA had been trying to implement a State Plan Amendment (SPA) approved in 2012 called Adult Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Services (ASARS), which would allow Medicaid reimbursement for certain substance use disorder treatment services. After the merger the decision was made to create new certification standards that would incorporate the requirements of the ASARS SPA and would also reflect the new American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) criteria and the differing Levels of Care. These changes, as well as aligning the certification application with other programs offered by DBH, will allow a higher quality, more person-centered substance use disorder treatment and recovery system in the District of Columbia. Additionally being able to receive Medicaid reimbursement for most of the treatment services will enable DBH to offer additional recovery support services, which were previously funded through a grant, without interruption in services. Page 1 District of Columbia Page 2 of 5 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 54 of 1941 Step 2: Identify the Unmet Service Needs and Critical Gaps within the Current System Needs and Gaps within the Adult Service System The two (2) initiatives below began prior to the creation of DBH, under the separate mental health and substance use disorder systems, and have remained priorities since the Department's inception on October 1, 2013. They require significant planning, system transformation, and development. One of the pr imary needs and critical gaps within the District's health and mental health systems was the lack of health homes. The District Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF) and the Department of Health (DOH) partnered with the DBH predecessor agency, the Depar tment of Mental Health (DMH) , to begin the planning process to design health homes tailored to the needs of chronically i ll Medicaid beneficiaries who, through better care management and coordination, would most likely experience improved health outcomes and reductions in emergency room visits and avoidable hospital admissions. Through the analysis of Medicaid claims and managed care encounter data, these h igh-risk Medicaid beneficiaries, many of whom suffer ed from mental illness, including a serious mental illness or a ser ious emotional disturbance were identif ied. Another aspect of the planning process involved determining the co -morbidities of Medicaid beneficiaries with mental health conditions, the utilization patterns of these individuals and the capacity of providers enrolled in the District's Medicaid prog ram to serve as a health home. The Distr ict also surveyed states with existing Medicaid health home state plan amendments (SPA) for best practices in health home design and implementation. A contractor was hired to assist in the process. The initial goal was to seek federal approval from the Centers for Medicare an d Medicaid Services ( CMS ), via a state plan amendment ( SPA), to establish health homes beginning in 2014. The District's FY 2014 -FY 2015 Mental Health Block Grant Application introduced the establishment of health homes as one of the priority initiatives. The process took longer than anticipated with the SPA not being approved until September 2, 2015. The recommended provider core services agencies (CSAs) start -up phase that involves staff hiring and training is expected to be completed by November 15, 201 5. The launch of the District Health Homes initiative will be January 1, 2016 with full implementation by September 2016. This priority initiative is being continued in the District's FY 2016 -FY 2017 Mental Health Block Grant Application. Another primary need and critical gap is related to substance use disorder treatment and recovery services. DBH was created from the merger of the District's mental health and addiction systems (the Department of Mental Health and the Department of Health/Addiction Preve ntion and Recovery Administration/APRA). Prior to that time DOH/APRA had been trying to implement a State Plan Amendment (SPA) approved in 2012 called Adult Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Services (ASARS), which would allow Medicaid reimbursement for cer tain substance use disorder treatment services. After the merger the decision was made to create new certification standards that would incorporate the requirements of the ASARS SPA and would also reflect the new American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASA M) criteria and the differing Levels of Care. These changes, as well as aligning the certification application with other programs offered by DBH, will allow a higher quality, more person -centered substance use disorder treatment and District of Columbia Page 3 of 5 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 55 of 1942 recovery system in the District. Additionally, being able to receive Medicaid reimbursement for most of the treatment services will enable DBH to offer additional recovery support services, which were previously funded through a grant, without interruption in services. The im plementation of Medicaid billing for ASARS was begun in FY 2013 through a partnership with the Department of Health Care Finance to amend the ASARS SPA and develop regulations that would allow implementation of Medicaid services and billing. The work conti nued through FY 2014. CMS approved the amended SPA in August 2015. The new certification regulations which implemented the SPA were finalized in September 2015 and Medicaid billing is e xpected to begin by December 1, 2015. DBH is working closely with th e Department of Health Care Finance in the implementation of this initiative. This initiative is one of the priority initiatives introduced for the first time in the District's FY 2016 -FY 2017 Mental Health Block Grant Application. Needs and Gaps within t he Child and Youth Service System A primary need and critical gap in the child and youth service system is creating environments more conducive for treatment services, programs and supports for the transition age youth and young adults. This population no longer fits in the child/youth sys tem nor do they fit in the adult system. The adult providers could benefit from technical assistance and training to enhance existing knowledge and skills and/or acquire additional information about effective communication and engagement methods and strate gies, treatment services, programs and supports that have demonstrated positive outcomes to address the mental health and/or behavioral health needs of transition age youth and young adults. The Child and Youth Services Division staff will work with the providers to encourage the transition age youth and young adults to participate in staff led discussions as well as peer focus groups to develop ways to make their experience more relevant to their needs. This may involve communication styles, modifying ex isting programs and/or creating new ones, and other issues. The Child and Youth Services Division staff will also seek technical assistance and training for providers as well as ways to provide training experiences to transition age youth and young adult s. District of Columbia Page 4 of 5 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 56 of 194Step 2 : Address Unmet Service Needs and Gaps Health Home Initiative : The Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) Health Home Initiative was introduced in the FY 2014 -FY 2015 Mental Health Block Application as a priority area. During FY 2015, 14 DBH certified core services agencies (CSAs) were recommended to receive infrastructure development assistance to hire and train Health Home staff (Director, Nurse Care Manager and Primary Care Liaison) by November 15, 2015. The State Pla n Amendment (SPA) was approved by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on September 2, 2015. The success of the Health Home Initiative will be determined by each provider program's ability to achieve outcomes as measured by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) and DBH Health Home Core Quality Measures. All state Health Home programs are required to use eight (8) CMS Core Health Home quality measures in order to monitor and evaluate their program. They include: 1) Adult BMI Assessment ; 2) Ambulatory Care Sensitive Condition Admission ; 3) Care Transition - Transition Record Transmitted to Healthcare Professional; 4) Follow -Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness; 5) Plan - All Cause Readmission; 6) Screening for Clinical D epression and Follow -Up Plan; 7) Blood Pressure Screening; and 8) Initiation and Engagement of Alcohol and Other Drug Dependence Treatment . They are derived from and aligned with: 1) the mandatory quality measure reporting requirements included within section 401 of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthor ization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA); 2) the voluntary quality measure reporting requirements within section 2701 of the Affordable Care Act; and 3) the mandatory quality measure reporting requirements wit hin section 3502 of the Affordable Care Act. The purpose of the core set is to assess individual -level clinical outcomes, experience of care outcomes, and quality of care outcomes specific to the provision of health home services. The District has also ide ntified local measures that will augment the federally mandated data set. These seven (7) Health Home Quality Metrics for Reporting include: 1) Prevention Quality Indicators Inpatient Utilization; 2) Emergency Department Utilization; 3) Tobacco Cessation Screening; 4) Tobacco Cessation; 5) Individual Rehabilitation Plan; 6) Individuals With Regular Physical Health Exams/Checkups; and 7) Consumer Satisfaction . The data related to the CMS and the District Core Health Home quality measures will be collected beginning January 2016. District of Columbia Page 5 of 5 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 57 of 194Planning Steps Quality and Data Collection Readiness Narrative Question: Health surveillance is critical to SAMHSA's ability to develop new models of care to address substance abuse and mental illne ss. SAMHSA provides decision makers, researchers and the general public with enhanced information about the extent of substance abuse an d mental illness, how systems of care are organized and financed, when and how to seek help, and effective models of care, including the outcom es of treatment engagement and recovery. SAMHSA also provides Congress and the nation reports about the use of block grant and other SAMHSA f unding to impact outcomes in critical areas, and is moving toward measures for all programs consistent with SAMHSA's NBHQF . The effort is part of the congressionally mandated National Quality Strategy to assure health care funds - public and private - are used most effectively and efficiently to create better health, better care, and better value. The overarching goals of this effort are to ensure that services are evi dence -based and effective or are appropriately tested as promising or emerging best practices; they are person/family -centered; care is coordinated across systems; services promote healthy living; and, they are safe, accessible, and affordable. SAMHSA is currently working to harmonize data collection efforts across discretionary programs and match relevant NBHQF and N ational Quality Strategy (NQS) measures that are already endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF) wherever possible. SAMHSA is al so working to align these measures with other efforts within HHS and relevant health and social programs and to reflect a mix of outcomes, processes, and costs of services. Finally, consistent with the Affordable Care Act and other HHS priorities, these efforts will seek to unde rstand the impact that disparities have on outcomes. For the FY 2016 -2017 Block Grant Application, SAMHSA has begun a transition to a common substance abuse and mental health client -level data (CLD) system. SAMHSA proposes to build upon existing data systems, namely TEDS and the mental health CLD system develope d as part of the Uniform Reporting System. The short -term goal is to coordinate these two systems in a way that focuses on essential data elements and minimizes data collection disruptions. The long -term goal is to develop a more efficient and robust program of data collection about behavioral health services that can be used to evaluate the impact of the block grant program on prevention and treatment services perfo rmance and to inform behavioral health services research and policy. This will include some level of direct reporting on client -level data from states on unique prevention and treatment services purchased under the MHBG and SABG and how these services contribute to overall outcomes. It should be noted that SAMHSA itself does not intend to collect or maintain any personal identifying information on individuals served wi th block grant funding. This effort will also include some facility -level data collection to understand the overall financing and service delivery process on client -level and systems -level outcomes as individuals receiving services become eligible for services that are covered under fee -for-service or capitation systems, which results in encounter reporting. SAMHSA will continue to work with its partners to look at current facility col lection efforts and explore innovative strategies, including survey methods, to gather facility and client level data. The initial draft set of measures developed for the block grant programs can be found at http://www.samhsa.gov/data/quality -metrics/block - grant -measures . These measures are being discussed with states and other stakeholders. To help SAMHSA determine how best to move forward with our partners, each state must identify its current and future capacity to report these measures or measures like them, types of adjustments to current and future state -level data collection efforts necessary to submit the new streamlined performance measures, technical assistance needed to make those adjustments, and perceived or actual barriers to such data collection and reporting. The key to SAMHSA's success in accomplishing tasks associated with data collection for the block grant will be the collaborat ion with SAMHSA's centers and offices, the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD), the National Assoc iation of State Alcohol Drug Abuse Directors (NASADAD), and other state and community partners. SAMHSA recognizes the significant implication s of this undertaking for states and for local service providers, and anticipates that the development and implementation process will take several years and will evolve over time. For the FY 2016 -2017 Block Grant Application reporting, achieving these goals will result in a more coordinated behavioral health data collec tion program that complements other existing systems (e.g., Medicaid administrative and billing data systems; and state mental hea lth and substance abuse data systems), ensures consistency in the use of measures that are aligned across various agencies and report ing systems, and provides a more complete understanding of the delivery of mental health and substance abuse services. Both goals can only be achieved through continuous collaboration with and feedback from SAMHSA's state, provider, and practitioner partners. SAMHSA anticipates this movement is consistent with the current state authorities' movement toward system integration and wil l minimize challenges associated with changing operational logistics of data collection and reporting. SAMHSA understands modifications to data collection systems may be necessary to achieve these goals and will work with the states to minimize the impact of these chan ges. States must answer the questions below to help assess readiness for CLD collection described above: Briefly describe the state's data collection and reporting system and what level of data is able to be reported currently (e. g., at the client, program, provider, and/or other levels).1. Is the state's current data collection and reporting system specific to substance abuse and/or mental health services clients , or is it part of a larger data system? If the latter, please identify what other types of data are collected and for what populations (e.g., M edicaid, child welfare, etc.).2. District of Columbia Page 1 of 3 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 58 of 194Is the state currently able to collect and report measures at the individual client level (that is, by client served, but not with client - identifying information)? 3. If not, what changes will the state need to make to be able to collect and report on these measures?4. Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section. Please use the box below to indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section: There are no identified technical assistance needs at this time. Footnotes: District of Columbia Page 2 of 3 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 59 of 194States must answer the questions belo w to help assess readiness for Client Level Data collection . 1. Briefly describe the state's data collection and reporting system and what level of data can be reported currently (e.g., at the client, program, provider, and/or other levels). DBH recently implemented a new electronic mental health record (iCAMS) that allows for clinical documentation, as well as billing. Information can be extracted at the client, program, and provider level. Because not all contracted providers are entering information directly into iCAMS, the data has to be combined in an SQL serve r data warehouse. Because the data from the previous billing system already resides in this warehouse, this will minimize the recoding needed to continue reporting on CLD. Unlike the previous system, iCAMS allows for historical information to be pulled, so DBH will now be able to report on status at intake and at discharge (or at the time of reporting). 2. Is the state's current data collection and reporting system specific to substance abuse and/or mental health services clients, or is it part of a larger data system? If the latter, please identify what other types of data are collected and for what populations (e.g., Medicaid, child welfare, etc.). DBH's iCAMS system is exclusively for mental health clients. There is a separate system for substance use clients. 3. Is the state currently able to collect and report on the draft measures at the individual client level (that is, by client served, but not with client -identifying information)? Yes, DBH is currently able to collect and report on client level data. DBH used the MH - TEDS format in FY14 and FY15 to report client level data out of our previous data system. DBH will continue to report on MH -TEDS out of iCAMS. 4. If not, what changes will the state need to make to be able to collect and report on th ese measures? DBH will work to report on more measures than in the past, including status at intake and discharge/time of report, now that iCAMS allows for this history.

Objective: The Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) announced a Request for Applications (RFA) to provide infrastructure development as sistance to DBH - certified core services agencies (CSAs) to hire and train Health Home staff including the Health Home Director, Nurse Care Ma nager and Primary Care Liaison by November 15, 2015. Strategies to attain the objective: Establish a review committee to review all provider applications. Select recommended and approved providers. The selected pro viders will hire and train Health Home staff including the Health Home Director, Nurse Care Manager and Primary Care Liaison by November 15, 2015. Indicator #: 1 Indicator: Complete the start -up phase and begin services by January 2016. Baseline Measurement: There is no baseline measure. The initial phase of the Health Homes initiative is the start -up phase that includes the following timeline: 1) State Plan Amendment approval - September 2015; 2) Initial health homes identified - September 2015; 3) Start -up grants issued - September 2015; 4) Health Home teams in place - November 2015; 5) Training begins - November 2015; and 6) Services begin - January 2016. First-year target/outcome measurement: The first -year target/outcome measurement depends upon the responses to the RFA. The initial health homes will be identified in September 2015. Second -year target/outcome measurement: Data Source: The DBH data source is the Integrated Care Application Management System (iCAMS). Health Home providers will participate in a series of trainings beginning in November 2015. Several trainings will focus on the use of iCAMS, information management, data analytics and data driven decision making in support of the activities of the Health Home. iCAMS will be populated with consumer information including initial and periodic health status updates and risk assessments, via interfaces to entities such as: 1) District federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) - most utilize their own electronic health record solution; 2) District hospitals - leverage the Encounter Notification Service (ENS) available to health information exchanges; 3) District Medicaid Management Information Systems (MMIS) - periodic Medicaid encounter data will be generated and uploaded into iCAMS; 4) other administrative systems such as the District of Columbia Access System (DCAS) - the District 's integrated eligibility determination system, and Web Infrastructure for Treatment Services (WITS) - the system used to track delivery of SAMHSA -funded substance abuse services by authorized providers; and 5) high -volume labs and pharmacies for electronic lab results and medication prescription fills. iCAMS will support the following essential Health Home functions: 1) initial screening and health/functional assessment, risk analysis and stratification; 2) proactive alerts to Health Home providers, at a minimum, for emergency room utilization, inpatient hos pitalization, visits to certain provider types and when a consumer does not obtain a medication refill; 3) Comprehensive Care Plan (CCP) de velopment enhanced by best practices and real -time intelligence about a consumer/client 's health status ( e.g. potential drug -to-drug interactions, multiple allergies, evidence gathered from patients with similar conditions; and 4) provide ability for multiple Health Home team members to access the CCP in a secured system.

During FY 2015, 14 DBH certified core services agencies (CSAs) were recommended to receive infrastructure development assistance to hire and train Health Home staff (Director, Nurse Care Manager and Primary Care Liaison) by November 15, 2015. The State Plan Amendment (SPA) was approved by the Center fo r Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on September 2, 2015. The success of the Health Home Initiative will be determined by each provider program's ability to achieve outcomes as measured by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) and DBH H ealth Home Core Quality Measures. All state Health Home programs are required to use eight (8) CMS Core Health Home quality measures in order to monitor and evaluate their program. They include: 1) Adult BMI Assessment ; 2) Ambulatory Care Sensitive Condition Admission ; 3) Care Transition - Transition Record Transmitted to Healthcare Professional; 4) Follow -Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness; 5) Plan - All Cause Readmission; 6) Screening for Clinical Depression and Follow -Up Plan; 7) Blood Pr essure Screening; and 8) Initiation and Engagement of Alcohol and Other Drug Dependence Treatment . They are derived from and aligned with: 1) the mandatory quality measure reporting requirements included within section 401 of the Children's Health Insuranc e Program Reauthor ization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA); 2) the voluntary quality measure reporting requirements within section 2701 of the Affordable Care Act; and 3) the mandatory quality measure reporting requirements within section 3502 of the Affordable Care A ct. The purpose of the core set is to assess individual -level clinical outcomes, experience of care outcomes, and quality of care outcomes specific to the provision of health home services. The District has also identified local measures that will augment the federally mandated data set. These seven (7) Health Home Quality Metrics for Reporting include: 1) Prevention Quality Indicators Inpatient Utilization; 2) Emergency Department Utilization; 3) Tobacco Cessation Screening; 4) Tobacco Cessation; 5) Indiv idual Rehabilitation Plan; 6) Individuals With Regular Physical Health Exams/Checkups; and 7) Consumer Satisfaction .

The Health Care System and Integration Narrative Question: Persons with mental illness and persons with substance use disorders are likely to die earlier than those who do not have the se conditions.26 Early mortality is associated with broader health disparities and health equity issues such as socioeconomic status but \"[h]ealth system factors \" such as access to care also play an important role in morbidity and mortality among these populations. Persons with mental illness and substance use disorders may benefit from strategies to control weight, encourage exercise, and properly treat such chronic he alth conditions as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.27 It has been acknowledged that there is a high rate of co - occurring mental illness and substance abuse, with appropriate treatment required for both conditions.28 Overall, America has reduced its heart disease risk based on lessons from a 50 -year research project on the town of Framingham, MA, outside Boston, where researchers followed thousands of residents to help und erstand what causes heart disease. The Framingham Heart Study produced the idea of \"risk factors\" and helped to make many connections for predicting and preventing heart disease. There are five major preventable risks identified in the Framingham Heart Study that may impact people who live with mental i llness. These risks are smoking, obesity, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, and hypertension. These risk factors can be appropriately modified by implementing well - known evidence -based practices29 30 that will ensure a higher quality of life. Currently, 50 states have organizationally consolidated their mental and substance abuse authorities in one fashion or anothe r with additional organizational changes under consideration. More broadly, SAMHSA and its federal partners understand that such factors as education, housing, and nutrition strongly affect the overall health and well -being of persons with mental illness and substance use disorders.31 Specific to children, many children and youth with mental illness and substance use issues are more likely to be seen in a health care se tting than in the specialty mental health and substance abuse system. In addition, children with chronic medical conditions have more than two times the likelihood of having a mental disorder. In the U.S., more than 50 percent of adults with mental illness had symptoms by age 14, and three - fourths by age 24. It is important to address the full range of needs of children, youth and adults through integrated health care approaches across prevention, early identification, treatment, and recovery. It is vital that SMHAs' and SSAs' programming and planning reflect the strong connection between behavioral, physical and pop ulation/public health, with careful consideration to maximizing impact across multiple payers including Medicaid, exchange products, and com mercial coverages. Behavioral health disorders are true physical disorders that often exhibit diagnostic criteria through behavior and patient r eports rather than biomarkers. Fragmented or discontinuous care may result in inadequate diagnosis and treatment of both physical an d behavioral conditions, including co -occurring disorders. For instance, persons receiving behavioral health treatment may be at risk for developing diabetes and experiencing complications if not provided the full range of necessary care.32 In some cases, unrecognized or undertreated physical conditions may exacerbate or cause psychiatric conditions.33 Persons with physical conditions may have unrecognized mental challenges or be at increased risk for such challenges.34 Some patients may seek to self -medicate due to their chronic physical pain or become addicted to prescribed medications or illicit drugs.35 In all these and many other ways, an individual's mental and physical health are inextricably linked and so too must their health care be integrated and coordinated among providers and programs. Health care professionals and consumers of mental illness and substance abuse treatment recognize the need for improved coord ination of care and integration of physical and behavioral health with other health care in primary, specialty, emergency and rehabilitative care settings in the community. For instance, the National Alliance for Mental Illness has published materials for members to assist them in coordinating pediatric mental health and primary care.36 SAMHSA and its partners support integrated care for persons with mental illness and substance use disorders.37 Strategies supported by SAMHSA to foster integration of physical and behavioral health include: developing models for inclusion of behavioral health treatment in primary care; supporting innovative payment and financing strategies and delivery system reforms such as ACOs, health homes, pay for performance, etc.; promoting workforce recruitment, retention and training efforts; improving understanding of financial sust ainability and billing requirements; encouraging collaboration between mental and substance abuse treatment providers, prevention of teen pr egnancy, youth violence, Medicaid programs, and primary care providers such as federally qualified health centers; and sharing with consumer s information about the full range of health and wellness programs. Health information technology, including electronic health records (EHRs) and telehealth are examples of important strategies to promote integrated care.38 Use of EHRs - in full compliance with applicable legal requirements - may allow providers to share information, coordinate care and improve billing practices. Telehealth is another important tool that may allow behavioral health prevention, care, a nd recovery to be conveniently provided in a variety of settings, helping to expand access, improve efficiency, save time and reduce costs. Dev elopment and use of models for coordinated, integrated care such as those found in health homes39 and ACOs40 may be important strategies used by SMHAs and SSAs to foster integrated care. Training and assisting behavioral health providers to redesign or implement new provider billing practices, build capacity for third -party contract negotiations, collaborate with health clinics and other organizations and provider networks, and coordinate benefits among multiple funding sources may be important ways to foster integrated care. SAMHSA encourages SMHAs and SSAs to communicate frequently with stakeholders, including policymakers at the state/jurisdictional and local levels, and State Ment al Health Planning Council members and consumers, about efforts to foster health care coverage, access and integrate care to ensure beneficial o utcomes. District of Columbia Page 1 of 6 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 80 of 194The Affordable Care Act is an important part of efforts to ensure access to care and better integrate care. Non-grandfathered health plans sold in the individual or the small group health insurance markets offered coverage for mental and substance use disorders as an esse ntial health benefit. SSAs and SMHAs also may work with Medicaid programs and Insurance Commissioners to encourage development of innovative demonstration projects and waivers that test approaches to providing integrated care for persons with mental illness and subs tance use disorders and other vulnerable populations.41 Ensuring both Medicaid and private insurers provide required preventive benefits also may be an area for collaboration.42 One key population of concern is persons who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.43 Roughly, 30 percent of dually eligible persons have been diagnosed with a mental illness, more than three times the rate among those who are not dually eligible.44 SMHAs and SSAs also should collaborate with Medicaid, insurers and insurance regulators to develop policies to assist those individuals who exper ience health coverage eligibility changes due to shifts in income and employment.45 Moreover, even with expanded health coverage available through the Marketplace and Medicaid and efforts to ensure parity in health care coverage, persons with behavioral health conditions stil l may experience challenges in some areas in obtaining care for a particular condition or finding a provider.46 SMHAs and SSAs should remain cognizant that health disparities may affect access, health care coverage and integrated care of behavioral health conditions and work with partners to mitigate regional and local variations in services that detrimentally affect access to care and integration. SMHAs and SSAs should ensure access and integrated prevention care and recovery support in all vulnerable populations includi ng, but not limited to college students and transition age youth (especially those at risk of first episodes of mental illness or substan ce abuse); American Indian/Alaskan Natives; ethnic minorities experiencing health behavioral health disparities; military families; and, LGBT individuals. SMHAs and SSAs should discuss with Medicaid and other partners, gaps that may exist in services in the post -Affordable Care Act environment and the best uses of block grant funds to fill such gaps. SMHAs and SSAs should work with Medicaid and other stakeholders to facilitate reimbursement for evidence -based and promising practices.47 It also is important to note CMS has indicated its support for incorporation within Medicaid programs of such approaches as peer support (under the supervision of mental health professionals) and trauma -informed treatment and systems of care. Such practices may play an important role in facilitating integrated, holistic care for adults and children with behavioral health conditions.48 SMHAs and SSAs should work with partners to ensure recruitment of diverse, well -trained staff and promote workforce development and ability to function in an integrated care environment.49 Psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, addiction counselors, preventionists, therapists, technicians, peer support specialists and others will need to understand integrated care models, concepts and practices. Another key part of integration will be defining performance and outcome measures. Following the Affordable Care Act, the Dep artment of Health and Human Services (HHS) and partners have developed the NQS, which includes information and resources to help promote health, good outcomes and patient engagement. SAMHSA's National Behavioral Health Quality Framework includes core measures that may b e used by providers and payers.50 SAMHSA recognizes that certain jurisdictions receiving block grant funds - including U.S. Territories, tribal entities and those jurisdictions that have signed compacts of free association with the U.S. - may be uniquely impacted by certain Affordable Care Act and Medicaid provisions or ineligible to participate in certain programs.51 However, these jurisdictions should collaborate with federal agencies and their governmental and non-governmental partners to expand access and coverage. Furthermore, the jurisdiction should ensure integration of prevention, treatment and recovery support for persons with, or at risk of, mental illnesses and substance use disorders. Numerous provisions in the Affordable Care Act and other statutes improve the coordination of care for patients through the c reation of health homes, where teams of health care professionals will be charged with coordinating care for patients with chronic conditions. States that have approved Medicaid State Plan Amendments (SPAs) will receive 90 percent Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for healt h home services for eight quarters. At this critical juncture, some states are ending their two years of enhanced FMAP and returning to their regular state FMAP for health home services. In addition, many states may be a year into the implementation of their dual eligible demonstration projects.

The Health Care System Integration There are several initiatives related to health care system integration. DC Mental Health Access Project (DC MAP): DBH awarded a contract to Children's National Health System in March 2015 to support ongoing development of behavioral health screening by primary care providers (pediatricians) that includes the DC MAP mental health consultation project. It provides pedia tricians with immediate access to mental health and/or psychiatric consultation as children/youth are identified as potentially needing behavioral health services. This project supports pediatricians in competently providing behavioral health care within t heir practice if appropriate or supports the timely linkage to the right behavioral health services. The education of primary care providers through the learning collaborative also continues as well as educational presentations within the primary care provider's office. This contract also supports the development of a psychiatric medication monitoring committee to the review children/youth prescribed multiple psychotropic medications. Health Home Initiative: This District initiative is a joint effort by th e Departments of Behavioral Health (DBH) and Health Care Finance (DHCF). The guiding principles include: 1) focus on person -centered care to include an individualized treatment plan designed to identify and coordinate with physical health and behavioral h ealth services, and provides culturally appropriate services; 2) service delivery accomplished through communication, collaboration and coordination; and 3) data driven decision and evidence -based practices that create positive health outcomes, and increas e health status and well -being at the individual and population -based levels. The goals include: 1) improving care coordination; 2) preventing avoidable hospital and emergency room visits; 3) improving the overall health status of persons with serious ment al illnesses; and 4) reducing health care costs. The eligibility requirements are: 1) 18 years of age or older; 2) Medicaid eligible and enrolled; 3) have a serious mental illness; and 4) may or may not have a co -existing chronic physical condition. The de signated providers are core services agencies within the DBH provider network. The Health Home provider responsibilities include: 1) coordinate and provide access to comprehensive individualized care management, preventive care, behavioral health and prima ry care, illness management, and community support network; 2) use health information technology to facilitate care coordination; 3) establish continuous quality improvement program; 4) collect and report data; and 5) participate in program evaluation. The implementation is scheduled for January 2016. Minority Aids Initiative Targeted Capacity Expansion Project (MAI -TCE): The Department of Health (DOH) Addiction Prevention and Recovery Administration (APRA) was a recipient of this SAMHSA grant initially aw arded to 12 cities across the nation. The outcomes included: 1) reduce HIV transmission; 2) increase the number of people receiving treatment for substance use disorder, mental health and/or co -occurring disorders; 3) increase the number of people who, rec eive recovery support services post treatment; 4) increase the number of people who know their HIV status; and (5) increase case management services District of Columbia Page 5 of 6 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 84 of 194and referrals to primary HIV care for antiretroviral therapy, primary care and other services for individua ls who test positive for HIV. The accomplishments include: 1) creating the DC HIV/Behavioral Health Pathway Network to implement and monitor multiple entry points for HIV/substance use/mental health client assessments, HIV testing, treatment referrals, sup port linkages and prevention services to the target population; 2) defining high risk target populations; 3) selecting three (3) initial project start -up sites (APRA Assessment and Recovery Center (ARC), Family and Medical Counseling Services, mental healt h system Access HelpLine); 4) expanding the network to additional partnering sites (La Clinica del Pueblo partnering with Latin American Youth Center, and Community Connections partnering with Unity Health, and Family Medical Counseling Center's Substance Use disorder program); 5 workforce capacity building; 6) co -occurring assessment training; and 7) the DBH Co -occurring Disorders Training Module. District of Columbia Health Benefit Exchange Authority (HBX): The mission of the HBX is to implement a health care exchange program in accordance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), thereby ensuring access to quality and affordable health care to all District residents. The Health Benefit Exchange Authority Establi shment Act of 2011 establishes the following core responsibilities: 1) enable individuals and small employers to find affordable and easier -to-understand health insurance; 2) facilitate the purchase and sale of qualified health plans; 3) assist small emplo yers in facilitating the enrollment of their employees in qualified health plans; 4) reduce the number of uninsured; 5) provide a transparent marketplace for health benefit plans; 6) educate consumers; and 7) assist individuals and groups to access program s, premium assistance tax credits, and cost -sharing reductions. The HBX is responsible for the development and operation of all core Exchange functions including the following: 1) certification of Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) and Qualified Dental Plans (Q DPs); 2) operation of a Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP); 3) consumer support for making coverage decisions; 4) eligibility determinations for individuals and families; 5) enrollment in QHPs; 6) contracting with certified carriers; and 7) deter mination for exemptions from the individual mandate. District of Columbia Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking (DISB): The DISB regulates financial -service businesses by administering District insurance, securities and banking laws, rules and r egulations. With regard to insurers, DISB provides guidance on the essential health benefits (EHB) benchmark package, including an itemized list of required benefits. The list is grouped by 10 categories required by the Affordable Care Act and includes: 1) ambulatory patient services; 2) emergency coverage; 3) hospitalization; 4) maternity/newborn care; 5) mental health, substance use disorders, behavioral health treatment; 6) prescription drugs; 7) rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; 8) laboratory services; 9) preventive and wellness services; and 10) pediatric services including oral and vision.

Health Disparities Narrative Question: In accordance with the HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities52, Healthy People, 202053, National Stakeholder Strategy for Achieving Health Equity54, and other HHS and federal policy recommendations, SAMHSA expects block grant dollars to support equity in access, services provided, and behavioral health outcomes among individuals of all cultures and ethnicities. Accordingly, grantees should collect and use data to: (1) identify subpopulations (i.e., racial, ethnic, limited English speaking, tribal, sexual/g ender minority groups, and people living with HIV/AIDS or other chronic diseases/impairments) vulnerable to health disparities and (2) implement str ategies to decrease the disparities in access, service use, and outcomes both within those subpopulations and in comparison to the general popula tion. One strategy for addressing health disparities is use of the recently revised National Standards for Culturally and Linguisticall y Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care (CLAS standards).55 The Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, which the Secretary released in April 2011, outlines goals an d actions that HHS agencies, including SAMHSA, will take to reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic minorities. Agencies are required to assess the impact of their policies and programs on health disparities. The top Secretarial priority in the Action Plan is to \"[a]ssess and heighten the impact of all HHS policies, programs, proces ses, and resource decisions to reduce health disparities. HHS leadership will assure that program grantees, as applicable, will be required to submit health disparity impact statements as part of their grant applications. Such statements can inform future HHS investments and policy goals, an d in some instances, could be used to score grant applications if underlying program authority permits.\"56 Collecting appropriate data is a critical part of efforts to reduce health disparities and promote equity. In October 2011, in accordance with section 4302 of the Affordable Care Act, HHS issued final standards on the collection of race, ethnicity, primary language, a nd disability status.57 This guidance conforms to the existing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directive on racial/ethnic categories with the e xpansion of intra-group, detailed data for the Latino and the Asian -American/Pacific Islander populations.58 In addition, SAMHSA and all other HHS agencies have updated their limited English proficiency plans and, accordingly, will expect block grant dollars to support a reduction in disparities related to access, service use, and outcomes that are associated with limited English proficiency. These three de partmental initiatives, along with SAMHSA's and HHS's attention to special service needs and disparities within tribal populations, LGBT populations, and women and girls, provide the foundation for addressing health disparities in the service delivery system. States provide behavioral hea lth services to these individuals with state block grant dollars. While the block grant generally requires the use of evidence -based and promising practices, it is important to note that many of these practices have not been normed on various diverse racial and ethnic populations. States should strive to implement evidence -based and promising practices in a manner that meets the needs of the populations they serve. In the block grant application, states define the population they intend to serve. Within these populations of focus are subp opulations that may have disparate access to, use of, or outcomes from provided services. These disparities may be the result of differences in i nsurance coverage, language, beliefs, norms, values, and/or socioeconomic factors specific to that subpopulation. For instance, lack of Spanish primary care services may contribute to a heightened risk for metabolic disorders among Latino adults with SMI; and American Indian/Alaska Native youth may have an increased incidence of underage binge drinking due to coping patterns related to historical trauma within the Ame rican Indian/Alaska Native community. While these factors might not be pervasive among the general population served by the block grant, they may be predominant among subpopulations or groups vulnerable to disparities. To address and ultimately reduce disparities, it is important for states to have a detailed understanding of who is being ser ved or not being served within the community, including in what languages, in order to implement appropriate outreach and engagement strategie s for diverse populations. The types of services provided, retention in services, and outcomes are critical measures of quality and outcome s of care for diverse groups. For states to address the potentially disparate impact of their block grant funded efforts, they will address access, use, and outcomes for subpopulations, which can be defined by the following factors: race, ethnicity, language, gender (including transgender), tribal connection, and sexual orientation (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual). Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the healthcare system and integration within the state's system: Does the state track access or enrollment in services, types of services (including language services) received and outcomes by race, ethnicity, gender, LGBT, and age?1. Describe the state plan to address and reduce disparities in access, service use, and outcomes for the above subpopulations.2.

Health Disparities The Department of Health (DOH) developed and disseminated the first edition of the District of Columbia Community Health Needs Assessment (February 28, 2014). It provides a comprehensive analysis and review of District residents ' health and quality of life . The health indicators data highlights some of the disparities for the District when compared to the United States (2010 reporting period). They include: 1) mortality and life expectancy - the District is higher on heart disease, cancer , diabetes, HIV disease , homicide/assault, and septicemia ; 2) maternal and child health outcomes - the District is higher on infant mortality , low birth rate, and teen birth rate ,; 3) chronic health indicators - the District is higher the cardiovascular diseases stroke; and 4) asthma - the District is higher on current asthma for children 17 and younger and adults 18 and older, and is higher on lifetime asthma for the same age groups. The DOH report also describes r ace/ethnic health disparities . They inclu de the following: 1. Non-Hispanic black infants account for a disproportionate percentage of all infant deaths. 2. Hispanic females were expected to live the longest in the District (88.9 years), followed closely by Hispanic males (88.4 years). 3. Hispanics newly diagnosed with HIV were more likely to be younger than other racial groups. 4. Blacks/African Americans have the highest obesity rates, and are least likely to exercise or consume the recommended serving of fruits and vegetables. 5. The crude d eath rate due to diabetes for Blacks/African Americans was seven (7) times the rate for Whites in 2010. 6. Blacks/African Americans were over three ( 3) times more likely to die from cerebrovascular diseases compared to their white counterparts.

Use of Evidence in Purchasing Decisions Narrative Question: There is increased interest in having a better understanding of the evidence that supports the delivery of medical and specia lty care including mental health and substance abuse services. Over the past several years, SAMHSA has received many requests from CMS, HRSA, SM As, state behavioral health authorities, legislators, and others regarding the evidence of various mental and substance abuse preventio n, treatment, and recovery support services. States and other purchasers are requesting information on evidence -based practices or other procedures that result in better health outcomes for individuals and the general population. While the emphasis on evidence -based practices will continue, there is a need to develop and create new interventions and technologies and in turn, to establish the evidence. SAMHSA supports states use of the block grants for this purpose. The NQF and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommend that evidence play a critical role in designin g health and behavioral health benefits for individuals enrolled in commercial insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare. To respond to these inquiries and recommendations, SAMHSA has undertaken several activities. Since 2001, SAMHSA has sponsored a National Registry of Evidenced -based Programs and Practices (NREPP). NREPP59 is a voluntary, searchable online registry of more than 220 submitted interventions supporting mental health promotion and treatment and substance abuse prevention and treatment. The purpose of NREPP is to connect members of the public to intervention developers so that they can learn how to implement these approaches in their co mmunities. NREPP is not intended to be an exhaustive listing of all evidence -based practices in existence. SAMHSA reviewed and analyzed the current evidence for a wide range of interventions for individuals with mental illness and s ubstance use disorders, including youth and adults with chronic addiction disorders, adults with SMI, and children and youth with (SED). The evidence builds on the evidence and consensus standards that have been developed in many national reports over the last decade or more. These include reports by the Surgeon General60, The New Freedom Commission on Mental Health61, the IOM62, and the NQF.63 The activity included a systematic assessment of the current research findings for the effectiveness of the services using a strict set of evidentiar y standards. This series of assessments was published in \"Psychiatry Online.\"64 SAMHSA and other federal partners (the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), the HHS Office of Civil Rights (OCR), and CMS) have used this information to sponsor technical expert panels that provide spe cific recommendations to the behavioral health field regarding what the evidence indicates works and for whom, identify specific st rategies for embedding these practices in provider organizations, and recommend additional service research. In addition to evidence -based practices, there are also many promising practices in various stages of development. These are services that have not been studied, but anecdotal evidence and program specific data indicate that they are effective. As these practices conti nue to be evaluated, the evidence is collected to establish their efficacy and to advance the knowledge of the field. SAMHSA's Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs)65 are best practice guidelines for the treatment of substance abuse. The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) draws on the experience and knowledge of clinical, research, and administrative experts to p roduce the TIPs, which are distributed to a growing number of facilities and individuals across the country. The audience for the TIPs is expanding beyond public and private substance abuse treatment facilities as alcohol and other drug disorders are increasingly recognized as a major p roblem. SAMHSA's Evidence -Based Practice Knowledge Informing Transformation (KIT)66 was developed to help move the latest information available on effective behavioral health practices into community -based service delivery. States, communities, administrators, practitioners, consumers of mental health care, and their family members can use KIT to design and implement behavioral health practices that work. KIT, part of SAMHSA's priority initiative on Behavioral Health Workforce in Primary and Specialty Care Settings, covers getting started, building t he program, training frontline staff, and evaluating the program. The KITs contain information sheets, introductory videos, practice demonstration videos, and training manuals. Each KIT outlines the essential components of the evidence -based practice and provides suggestions collected from those who have successfully implemented them. SAMHSA is interested in whether and how states are using evidence in their purchasing decisions, educating policymakers, or s upporting providers to offer high quality services. In addition, SAMHSA is concerned with what additional information is needed by SMHAs and SSAs in their efforts to continue to shape their and other purchasers' decisions regarding mental health and substance abuse services . Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state's system: Describe the specific staff responsible for tracking and disseminating information regarding evidence -based or promising practices. 1. How is information used regarding evidence -based or promising practices in your purchasing or policy decisions? 2. Are the SMAs and other purchasers educated on what information is used to make purchasing decisions?3. Does the state use a rigorous evaluation process to assess emerging and promising practices?4. Which value based purchasing strategies do you use in your state:5. Leadership support, including investment of human and financial resources.a. Use of available and credible data to identify better quality and monitored the impact of quality improvement interventions.b.

Prevention for Serious Mental Illness Narrative Question: SMIs such as schizophrenia, psychotic mood disorders, bipolar disorders and others produce significant psychosocial and econo mic challenges. Prior to the first episode, a large majority of individuals with psychotic illnesses display sub -threshold or early signs of psychosis during adolescence and transition to adulthood.67 The \"Prodromal Period \" is the time during which a disease process has begun but has not yet clinically manifested. In the case of psychotic disorders, this is often described as a prolonged period of attenuated and nonspecific thought, mood, and perceptual disturbances accompanied by poor psychosocial functioning, which has historically been identified retros pectively. Clinical High Risk (CHR) or At -Risk Mental State (ARMS) are prospective terms used to identify individuals who might be potentially in the prodromal phase of psychosis. While the MHBG must be directed toward adults with SMI or children with SED, including early intervention after the first psychiatric episode, states may want to consider using other funds for these emerging practices. There has been increasing neurobiological and clinical research examining the period before the first psychotic episode in or der to understand and develop interventions to prevent the first episode. There is a growing body of evidence supporting preemptive interventions that are successful in preventing the first episode of psychosis. The National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH) funded the North Ame rican Prodromal Longitudinal study (NAPLS), which is a consortium of eight research groups that have been working to create the evidence base for early detection and intervention for prodromal symptoms. Additionally, the Early Detection and Intervention for the Prevention of Psychosis (EDIPP) program, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, successfully broadened the Portland Identification and Early Referral (PIER) program from Portland, Maine, to five other sites across the country. SAMHSA supports the development and implementation of these promising practices for the early detection and intervention of individuals at Clinical High Risk for psychosis, and states may want to consider how these developing practices may fit within their system of care. Without intervention, the transition rate to psychosis for these individuals is 18 percent after 6 months of follow up, 22 percent after one year, 29 percent after two years, and 36 percent after three years. With in tervention, the risk of transition to psychosis is reduced by 54 percent at a one -year follow up.68 In addition to increased symptom severity and poorer functioning, lower employment rates and higher rates of substance use and overall greater disability rates are more prevalent.69 The array of services that have been shown to be successful in preventing the first episode of psychosis include accurate clinical identification of hig h-risk individuals; continued monitoring and appraisal of psychotic and mood symptoms and identification; intervention for substance use, suicida lity and high support; and psychotherapeutic techniques.70 71 This reflects the critical importance of early identification and intervention as there is a high cost associated with delayed treatment. Overall, the goal of early identification and treatment of young people at high clinical risk, or in the early stages of ment al disorders with psychosis is to: (1) alter the course of the illness; (2) reduce disability; and, (3) maximize recovery. ****It is important to note that while a state may use state or other funding for these services, the MHBG funds must be dire cted toward adults with SMI or children with SED.

Prevention for Serious Mental Illness The child and youth service system implements a number of p revention and early intervention services. These services include: 1) Parent Infant Early Childhood Enhancement Program (comprehensive services to children and families that focus on supporting cognition, language, motor skills, adaptive skills and social emotional functioning; 2) Healthy Start Project (addresses the medical and mental health challenges of women of childbearing age to reduce infant mortality by improving the emotional, mental and physical health of pre - and postnatal women); 3) Early Childhood Mental Health Consultation Program - Healthy Futures (center -based and child and family -centered consultation services to the staff and family members at child development centers); 4) Primary Project (evidence -based, early intervention/prevention program for identified children in Pre -kindergarten through 3rd grade who have mild problems with social -emotional adjustment in the classroom); and 5) School Mental Health Program (addresses psycho -social and mental health problems that become barriers to learning by providing prevention, early intervention, and treatment servi ces to youth, families, teachers and school staff). Also, the child and youth services program implements a number of evidence -based practices. They include: Child Parent Psychotherapy for Family Violence - for ages 0 -6 with a history of trauma exposure or maltreatment and their caregivers; 2) Trauma Systems Therapy - for ages 0 - 19 who have experienced traumatic events and/or who live in environments with ongoing traumatic stress; 3) Parent Child Interaction Therapy - for ages 2 -6 who experience extreme behavioral difficulties with emphasis on improving the quality of the parent -child relationship and changing parent -child interaction patterns; 4) Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - for ages 4 -18 and helps children, youth, and their parents overcome the negative effects of traumatic life events and address feelings; 5) Multi -Systemic Therapy - for ages 10 -17 with emphasis on empowering parents/caregivers effectiveness as they assist the child/youth in successfully mak ing and sustaining changes in individual, family, peer and school systems; 6) Multi -Systemic Therapy for Youth with Problem Sexual Behavior - for ages 10 -17 and is an intensive family and community based program that addresses factors that in fluence problem sexual behavior, focusing on the offender's home/ family, school, neighborhood and peers; and 7) Transition to Independence Process - an evidence supported model for ages 14 -29 that also engages their families and other informal key players in a process tha t facilitates their movement towards greater self -sufficiency and successful achievement of their goals.

NIMH has released information on Components of Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) for First Episode Psychosis. Results from the NIMH funded Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) initiative73, a research project of the NIMH, suggest that mental health providers across multiple disciplines can learn the principles of CSC for First Episode of Psychosis (FEP), and apply these skills to engage and treat persons in the e arly stages of psychotic illness. At its core, CSC is a collaborative, recovery -oriented approach involving clients, treatment team members, and when appropriate, relatives, as active participants. The CSC components emphasize outreach, low -dosage medications, evidenced -based supported employment and supported education, case management, and family psycho -education. It also emphasizes shared decision -making as a means to address individuals' with FEP unique needs, preferences, and recovery goals. Collaborative treatment planning in CSC is a respectful and effective means for establishing a positive therapeutic alliance and maintaining engagement with clients and their family members over time. Peer supports can also be an enhancement on this model. Many also braid funding from several sources to expand service capacity. States can implement models across a continuum that have demonstrated efficacy, including the range of services and principle s identified by NIMH. Using these principles, regardless of the amount of investment, and with leveraging funds through inclusion of services reimb ursed by Medicaid or private insurance, every state will be able to begin to move their system toward earlier intervention, or enhance the services already being implemented. It is expected that the states' capacity to implement this programming will vary based on the actual funding from the five pe rcent allocation. SAMHSA continues to provide additional technical assistance and guidance on the expectations for data collection and reportin g.

Footnotes: District of Columbia Page 1 of 8 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 95 of 194District of Successes Generated by the 5% Set -Aside The Mandate: The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) required states to amend their FY 2014 -2015 Mental Health Block Grant Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan to outline a process that would describe an evidence -based program that addresses the needs of individuals with early serious mental illness, including psychotic disorders. SAMHSA increased the state's Mental Health Block Grants by 5% to provide funds for this initiative. The Model: The District of Columbia Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) used an existing service delivery program that combines the Transition to Independence (TIP) model (an evidence supported model) with the Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) model for transition aged youth and young adults (an evidence -based practice), which is called the TACT Program. The Providers: There are two (2) DBH mental health rehabilitation services (MHRS) providers, Community Connections and Family Preservation Services of DC that operate TACT Programs. The Target Population: The target population is youth and young adults age 18 -29 served by the two (2) TACT Programs. The B udget: The amount of funds available to the District from the SAMHSA Mental Health Block Grant for evidence -based projects for early intervention (5% set -aside) was $46,696.00. The Planned Activities: The primary activities include: 1) a focus group with TIP and TACT programs; 2) first psychosis episode and related training; and 3) a pilot study with the two (2) TACT programs. Focus Group : DBH program staff decided to convene a focus group with the providers in lieu of conducting a survey (the original pla n). The purpose of the focus group with the TIP and TACT Programs was to obtain information about services and supports including non-traditional and person -centered services that would enhance successful implementation of these program models and the live s of the youth and young adults served. This activity was convened on August 15, 2014 at the DBH Child and Youth Services Division (CYSD) community site. The co -facilitators were the designated CYSD Program Manager for this initiative and the Program Manag er for the Mental Health Block Grant. The discussion topics included: 1) traditional services and supports provided and those most utilized by transition age youth (TAY); 2) non -traditional services and supports provided and those most utilized by TAY; 3) non-traditional services and supports the agencies would like to provide TAY but are not currently available; 4) non -traditional services and supports not currently available that TAY have requested; 5) non -traditional services and supports available throu gh community or other resources that are needed and/or TAY have requested; 6) partnerships developed to access some of the non -traditional services and supports that are available; 7) methods District of Columbia Page 2 of 8 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 96 of 194used to routinely assess TAY level of satisfaction with the serv ices and supports provided; 8) methods routinely used to obtain input from TAY about improving the services and supports provided; 9) access to person -centered funding for TAY and the funding priorities; and 10) process to confirm that TAY agree with agenc y priorities. The focus group discussions generated important ideas and issues that were summarized. First Psychosis Episode Training : DBH partnered with the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to provide a first episode psychosis (FEP) educational and training event for Department staff, consumers/clients, providers and other community partners. On November 10, 2014 Drs. Amy B. Goldstein and Susan T. Azrin from NIMH conducted a presentation on Prevention and Early Intervention of Psychosis: Lessons Learned from the NIMH RAISE Project . The presentation topics included: 1) schizophrenia overview; 2) rationale for early intervention in psychosis; 3) NIMH Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) initiative; 4) Coordinated Specialty Care (C SC) model; 5) financing CSC programs; and 6) next steps. The presentation was quite informative and well received. The event was attended by 52 individuals. Social Workers and Addiction Counselors received continuing education units. DBH staff also parti cipated in a series of webinars on FEP and related topics. They included: Strategies for Funding Coordinated Specialty Care Initiatives, June 30, 2015 Using the 5% MHBG Set -Aside to Support Programming for First Episode Psychosis: Activities and Lessons Learned from the State of Ohio , June 29, 2015 Lessons Learned in Implementing Models for Early Intervention in Psychosis, June 5, 2015 An Overview of Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) for Persons with First Episode Psychosis: A Presentation to State Planning Councils , April 13, 2015 Inventory and Environmental Scan of Evidence - Based Practices for Treating Persons in Early Stages of Serious Mental Disorders: Resource Overview , February 11, 2015 First Episodes of Psychosis as it pertains to the Mental Health Block Grant: FEP Modeling Tool, October 28, 2014 First Episodes of Psychosis as it pertains to the Mental Health Block Grant: Definition and Prevalence, October 22, 2014 Community Outreach and Prevention as an Element of Early Intervention in Psychosis, July 22, 2014 Funding Strategies for Early Psychosis Intervention Models, July 9, 2014 Prep for Success: Lessons Learned in Implementing Models for Early Intervention in Psychosis , June 5, 2014 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and its Use with Persons in Early Stages of Serious Mental Illness , May 29, 2014 Components of Coordinated Specialty Care for First Episode Psychosis: Guidance Related to the 5% Set -Aside , May 2, 2014 TACT Program Pilot Study : DBH contracted with two (2) transition age youth/young adult TACT Programs to conduct a mini -pilot study using a sample of their program District of Columbia Page 3 of 8 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 97 of 194participants. They were each awarded $23,348.00. The goals of the pilot are to: 1) examine the system's ability to iden tify FEP onset and the length of time before treatment is received; and 2) use the findings to inform the District's ability to implement Components of a Coordinated Specialty Care for First Episode Psychosis program. The project activities involve: 1) developing a project report that includes a participant profile (onset of FEP and/or other mental health disorders, behavioral and social characteristics); 2) including peer input into the project through focus groups, other forms or activities; and 3) provi ding project participants with traditional and non -traditional supports, opportunities and experiences that enhance positive growth and development. The projects are underway and will be completed at the end of September 2015. Other Related Initiatives : DBH is involved in two (2) other initiatives related to the pilot study that are described below. National Council Community of Practice (CoP) on Early Onset Schizophrenia (EOS) - DBH was accepted into the National Council's CoP on EOS in February 2015 and joined the National Council in early March 2015. The DBH/DC team completed a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis to identify opportunities and barrie rs to the development of a strategic plan for the implementation of early intervention services in late March 2015. The team has attended all learning opportunities, including the monthly mandatory webinars and one -on-one office hours calls with early ons et experts. The DBH/DC team recently partnered with the Washington Community Mental Health Council (another member of the CoP on EOS) to begin peer -to-peer calls focusing on the development of a strategic planning tool that will help each team build capaci ty and knowledge about first episode psychosis that will ultimately result in more funding from our respective state/District legislatures. Develop RAISE -like or Other Program - Inspired by the RA1SE project, DBH set out to develop a local program for earl y onset schizophrenia. In December 2014, DBH reached out to community partners who share this interest. By January 2015, a working group was created that now includes representatives from the Green Door, Psychiatric Institute of Washington, Children's Nati onal Health System, the District's Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF), and DBH. This group has been reviewing prodromal schizophrenia and first episode psychosis initiatives across the country, with the intention of tailoring a program that best mee ts the needs of the District's at -risk population. The DBH/DC team has reached out to core services agencies (CSAs) and local hospitals in search of a clinical home for an EOS program. The current and planned activities include: 1) the Green Door and the Psychiatric Institute of Washington (PIW) have agreed to pool resources and house the program between their sites; 2) the Green Door and PIW are currently conducting internal needs assessments to determine the amount of start -up money required to bring in requisite staffing, training, and possibly architectural changes to launch a RA1SE -inspired EOS program; 3) upon completion of the needs assessment, the DBH/DC team will seek the start - up money through a Block Grant; and 4) DBH has also begun to receive District of Columbia Page 4 of 8 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 98 of 194technical assistance SAMHSA on identifying funding mechanisms for the non-Medicaid reimbursable EOS program services. Technical Assistance through SAMHSA - In May 2015, DBH developed a technical assistance request through the SAMHSA TA Tracker to suppor t its collaboration with public and private community partners in developing an Early Onset Schizophrenia initiative. Specifically, this partnership would most benefit from technical assistance in identifying viable mechanisms for funding and financially sustaining this initiative in the District. The TA request was approved in June 2015. There have been follow - up discussions with the SAMHSA contractor and the DBH/DC team about the best way to proceed. The DBH/DC team is trying to determine th e model that will be implemented. The goals and outcomes that the DBH/DC team would like to achieve as a resu lt of the technical assistance include: Goal 1 : Assess the current status of the Early Onset Schizophrenia initiative financing and sustainability strategies nationwide. Outcome : The DBH/DC team will identify the strategies that can be successfully implemented in the District. Goal 2: Assess the pros and cons of public -private partnerships in financing and sustaining Early Onset Schizophrenia initiatives. Outcome : The DBH/DC team will run a cost -benefit analysis of partnering in the up-front and ongoing financial support of a local Ea rly Onset Schizophrenia initiative. Goal 3: Assess the extent to which Early Onset Schizophrenia services are Medicaid reimbursable in other cities/states. Outcome : All Medicaid reimbursable services will be appropriately billed.

District of Columbia Evidence -Based Practices for Early Intervention (5 percent Set -Aside) Current Status Regarding the District Evidence -Based Practices for Early Intervention (5 percent Set -Aside) Initiative: The new contracts for the two (2) provider continuation projects have not been developed. The Department of Behavioral Health has met with the providers to discuss lessons learned from the projects implemented during FY 2015 and the SAMHSA revision information request. The information provided here is based on these discussions and provider draft r esponses to the SAMHSA issues. It should be noted that while this information will likely be included in the contracts, currently there are no approved and signed contracts. Issue 1: Description of Planned Activities for 2016 and 2017 Project Continuation During 2015, DBH launched a pilot project related to the Evidence -Based Practices for Early Intervention (5 percent Set -Aside) Initiative. During FY 2016 and FY 2017, DBH will continue the projects initiated in FY 2015 for transition age youth and young adults with the two (2) Transition to Independence Process (TIP) and Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) services known as TACT. These services are being provided as a program by Community Connections and Family Preservation Services. Prioriti es: The projects will recruit more TACT team members to participate in their projects. The projects will collect information about mental health histories, first episodes of psychosis (via project participant interviews or other data sources) and other per tinent data. The projects will create and implement project participant engagement strategies. The projects will provide more non -Medicaid reimbursable services for transition age youth and young adult project participants. Goals: The projects will obtain a minimum of 40 project participants. The projects will increase the number of completed project participant interviews. District of Columbia Page 6 of 8 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 100 of 1942 The projects will continue to develop a profile of project participants to include: age, gender, District ward, marital status, emplo yment status, housing status, length of time receiving TACT services, length of time receiving other services (if available), primary diagnosis, factors associated with not participating and/or dropping out of the project, and the types of non-Medicaid rei mbursable services and supports provided. The projects will document the chronological age of onset of psychosis, or other types of mental health issues, and/or behavioral health issues. If age data is not available, this information may be obtained from f amily members or other informant sources. Also, proxies for age may be school level of onset (elementary, middle school, high school, post high school), or a date and age timeline. The projects will document the length of time between diagnosis and receipt of interventions including the types of treatment, services, activities and supports. The projects will report project successes and challenges related to the transition age youth and young adults engagement in the project. The projects will report proje ct successes and challenges related to providing treatment, services, activities and supports to the transition age youth and young adults in the project. Objectives : The projects will identify the types of treatment, services, activities, and supports pr ovided to the TACT program transition age youth and young adults including non -Medicaid reimbursable services utilized by the project participants. The projects will identify the outcomes associated with the treatment, services, activities and supports pro vided to the TACT program transition age youth and young adults including non-Medicaid reimbursable services utilized by the project participants. Implementation Strategies : The project implementation strategies will include but not be limited to: 1) system indicators (e.g., how to launch the continuation program, steps taken to implement the program, new features added to the program, staff roles, data collection and reporting); 2) participant indicators (e.g., methods used to engage participants in t he project, information provided to the project participants, information obtained from the project participants through interviews and/or surveys, focus groups); and 3) non -Medicaid reimbursable services utilization (e.g., methods for determining what ser vices are needed and the services that will be provided including outcomes).

Participant Directed Care Narrative Question: As states implement policies that support self -determination and improve person -centered service delivery, one option that states may consider is the role that vouchers may play in their overall financing strategy. Many states have implemented voucher and self -directed care programs to help individuals gain increased access to care and to enable individuals to play a more significant role in the development o f their prevention, treatment, and recovery services. The major goal of a voucher program is to ensure individuals have a genuine, free, and inde pendent choice among a network of eligible providers. The implementation of a voucher program expands mental and substance use disorder trea tment capacity and promotes choice among clinical treatment and recovery support providers, providing individuals with the ability to secure the best treatment options available to meet their specific needs. A voucher program facilitates linking clinical treatment with other authorized services, such as critical recovery support services that are not otherwise reimbursed, including coordination, childcare, motivational development, early/brief intervention, outpatient treatment, medical services, support for room and board while in treatment, employment/e ducation support, peer resources, family/parenting services, or transportation. Voucher programs employ an indirect payment method with the voucher expended for the services of the individual's choosing or at a provider of their choice. States may use SABG and MHBG funds to introduce or enhance behavioral health voucher and self -directed care programs within the state. The state should assess the geographic, population, and service needs to determine if or where the voucher system will be mos t effective. In the system of care created through voucher programs, treatment staff, recovery support service providers, and referral org anizations work together to integrate services. States interested in using a voucher system should create or maintain a voucher management system to support vouchering and t he reporting of data to enhance accountability by measuring outcomes. Meeting these voucher program challenges by creating and coordinating a wide array of service providers, and leading them though the innovations and inherent system change processes, results in the buil ding of an integrated system that provides holistic care to individuals recovering from mental and substance use disorders. Likewise, every effort should be made to ensure services are reimbursed through other public and private resources, as applicable and in ways consistent with the goals of the voucher program Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section.

Participant Directed Care The Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) Person-Centered Project was initially launched in FY 2012 and continues to grow. The goal has been to provide a recovery-oriented and person-centered approach to care by supporting person-centered assessment and treatment planning throughout the system. The initial phase included assembling a person-centered committee of peers and representatives from DBH and community behavioral health provider agencies to plan a comprehensive launch strategy. Additional accomplishments included partnering with Diane Grieder and Neal Adams, national experts in person-centered care and authors of \"Treatment Planning for Person-Centered Care,\" the development of person-centered practice guidelines and the delivery of person-centered instructor training to the entire DBH provider network. As of June 2015, more than 4,500 classroom attendees were trained in behavioral health concepts, and over 7,500 continuing education contact hours were awarded to over 1,000 licensed attendees.

Program Integrity Narrative Question: SAMHSA has placed a strong emphasis on ensuring that block grant funds are expended in a manner consistent with the statutory and regulatory framework. This requires that SAMHSA and the states have a strong approach to assuring program integrity. Currently, the primary goals of SAMHSA program integrity efforts are to promote the proper expenditure of block grant funds, improve block grant program compliance nationally, and demonstrate the effective use of block grant funds. While some states have indicated an interest in using block grant funds for individual co -pays deductibles and other types of co -insurance for behavioral health services, SAMHSA reminds states of restrictions on the use of block grant funds outlined in 42 USC \u00a7\u00a7 300x -5 and 300x -31, including cash payments to intended recipients of health services and providing financial assistance to any entity other than a public or nonprofit private entity. Under 42 USC \u00a7 300x - 55, SAMHSA periodically conducts site visits to MHBG and SABG grantees to evaluate program and fiscal management. States will need to develop specific policies and procedures for assuring compliance with the funding requirements. Since MHBG funds can only be used for authorized services to adults with SMI and children with SED and SABG funds can only be used for individuals with or at risk for substance abuse, SAMSHA will release guidance imminently to the states on use of block grant funds for these purposes. States are encouraged to review the guidance and request any needed technical assistance to assure the appropriate use of suc h funds. The Affordable Care Act may offer additional health coverage options for persons with behavioral health conditions and block grant expenditures should reflect these coverage options. The MHBG and SABG resources are to be used to support, not supplant, individuals and services that will be covered through the Marketplaces and Medicaid. SAMHSA will provide additional guidance to the states to assist them in complying with program integrity recommendations; develop new and better tools for reviewing the block grant application and reports; and train SAMHSA staff, including Regional Administrators, in these new program integrity approaches and tools. In addition, SAMHSA will work with CMS and states to discuss possible strategies for sharing data, protocols, and information to assist our program integri ty efforts. Data collection, analysis and reporting will help to ensure that MHBG and SABG funds are allocated to support evidence -based, culturally competent programs, substance abuse programs, and activities for adults with SMI and children with SED. States traditionally have employed a variety of strategies to procure and pay for behavioral health services funded by the SA BG and MHBG. State systems for procurement, contract management, financial reporting, and audit vary significantly. These strategies may include :(1) appropriately directing complaints and appeals requests to ensure that QHPs and Medicaid programs are including essential health benefits ( EHBs) as per the state benchmark plan; (2) ensuring that individuals are aware of the covered mental health and substance abuse benefits; (3) ensuring that consumers of substance abuse and mental health services have full confidence in the confidentiality of their medical informat ion; and (4) monitoring use of behavioral health benefits in light of utilization review, medical necessity, etc. Consequently, states may have to reevaluate their current management and oversight strategies to accommodate the new priorities. They may also be required to become more proactive in ensuring that state -funded providers are enrolled in the Medicaid program and have the ability to determine if clients are enrolled or eligible t o enroll in Medicaid. Additionally, compliance review and audit protocols may need to be revised to provide for increased tests of client eligibili ty and enrollment. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state 's system: Does the state have a program integrity plan regarding the SABG and MHBG funds?1. Does the state have a specific policy and/or procedure for assuring that the federal program requirements are conveyed to int ermediaries and providers?2.

Program Integrity The Mental Health Block Grant program integrity activities include: 1) adherence to requirements set forth in the District's City-Wide Grants Manual and Source Book , 2) Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) policy; and 3) DBH funded program s and sub -grantee award proc ess including DBH fiscal and program monitoring. Mayor's Office of Partnerships and Grant Services (OPGS): This Office serves as the District government's grants clearinghouse in order to effectively administer mandatory policies and procedures that govern the solicitation of competitive grant funds among District agency grant seekers and their prospective grantees and/or sub -grantees. The City-Wide Grants Manual and Source Book establishes best practices policies and pro cedures for the application for, acceptance of, and disbursement of private, federal and local grant funds. The Sourcebook also provides an overview of the minimum requirements for the programmatic and financial operation of grants and sub -grants awarded b y the District and any of its covered agencies. Department of Behavioral (DBH) Health Policy 716.6 Screening for Eligibility to Participate in Federal Health Care Programs and to Contract with the District of Columbia Government : The Department will not contract with or employ individuals or entities that are ineligible to participate in federal health care programs or are ineligible to contract with the government of the District of Columbia. Section 4d. Exclusion List contains three (3) lists that prov ide information on any individual or entity excluded from participation in any federal health care program or from contracting with the District of Columbia. They include: 1) the List of Excluded of Individuals/Entities (LEIE) database maintained by the De partment of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Office of Inspector General, (OIG) of individuals or entities excluded by the OIG; 2) the General Services Administration (GSA) Excluded Parties List System (EPLS), which contains debarment actions taken by var ious Federal agencies, including exclusion actions taken by the OIG; and 3) the District of Columbia Excluded Party List maintained by the District's Debarment and Suspension Panel. The Mental Health Block Grant sub -grantee organizations are screened again st these lists. Mental Health Block Grant DBH and Sub -Grantee Awards: The process begins with the notice of funding availability (NOFA) and request for applications (RFA) announcement, which widely distributed and follows the OPGS and Sourcebook requireme nts.

Tribes Narrative Question: The federal government has a unique obligation to help improve the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives through the various health and human services programs administered by HHS. Treaties, federal legislation, regulations, executive orders, and Presidenti al memoranda support and define the relationship of the federal government with federally recognized tribes, which is derived from the pol itical and legal relationship that Indian tribes have with the federal government and is not based upon race. SAMHSA is required by the 2009 Memorandum on Tribal Consultation74 to submit plans on how it will engage in regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in the development of federal policies that have tribal implications. Improving the health and well -being of tribal nations is contingent upon understanding their specific needs. Tribal consultation is an essential tool in achieving that understanding. Consultation is an enhanced form of communication, which emphasizes trust, respect, and shared responsibility. It is an open and free exchange of information and opinion among parties, which leads to mutual understanding and comprehension. Consultation is integral to a deliberative process that results in effective collaboration and informed decision -making with the ultimate goal of reaching consensus on issues. In the context of the block grant funds awarded to tribes, SAMHSA views consultation as a government -to-government interaction and should be distinguished from input provided by individual tribal members or services provided for tribal members whether on or off t ribal lands. Therefore, the interaction should be attended by elected officials of the tribe or their designees and by the highest possibl e state officials. As states administer health and human services programs that are supported with federal funding, it is imperative that they cons ult with tribes to ensure the programs meet the needs of the tribes in the state. In addition to general stakeholder consultation, states should establish, implement, and document a process for consultation with the federally recognized tribal governments located within or governi ng tribal lands within their borders to solicit their input during the block grant planning process. Evidence that these actions have been pe rformed by the state should be reflected throughout the state's plan. Additionally, it is important to note that 67% of American Indian and Alaska Natives live off - reservation. SSAs/SMHAs and tribes should collaborate to ensure access and culturally competent care for all American Indians and Alaska Natives in the state. States shall not require any tribe to waive its sovereign immunity in order to receive funds or for services to be provided for tribal members on tribal lands. If a state does not have any federally recognized tribal governments or tribal lands within its borders, the state should make a declarative statement to that effect. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state 's system: Describe how the state has consulted with tribes in the state and how any concerns were addressed in the block grant plan. 1. Describe current activities between the state, tribes and tribal populations.2.

Primary Prevention for Substance Abuse Narrative Question: Federal law requires that states spend no less than 20 percent of their SABG allotment on primary prevention programs, althou gh many states spend more. Primary prevention programs, practices, and strategies are directed at individuals who have not been determined to require treatment for substance abuse. Federal regulation (45 CFR 96.125) requires states to use the primary prevention set -aside of the SABG to develop a comprehensive primary prevention program that includes activities and services provided in a variety of settings. The program must target both the general population and sub -groups that are at high risk for substance abuse. The program must include, but is not limited to, the following strategies: Information Dissemination provides knowledge and increases awareness of the nature and extent of alcohol and other drug use, abuse, and addiction, as well as their effects on individuals, families, and communities. It also provides knowledge and increases awareness of available prevention and treatment programs and services. It is characterized by one -way communication from the information source to the audience, with limited contact between the two. Education builds skills through structured learning processes. Critical life and social skills include decision making, peer resistance, coping with stress, problem solving, interpersonal communication, and systematic and judgmental capabilities. There is more interaction between facilitators and participants than there is for information dissemination. Alternatives provide opportunities for target populations to participate in activities that exclude alcohol and other drugs. The purpose is to discourage use of alcohol and other drugs by providing alternative, healthy activities. Problem Identification and Referral aims to identify individuals who have indulged in illegal or age -inappropriate use of tobacco, alcohol or other substances legal for adults, and individuals who have indulged in the first use of illicit drugs. The goal i s to assess if their behavior can be reversed through education. This strategy does not include any activity designed to determine if a person is in need of treatment. Community -based Process provides ongoing networking activities and technical assistance to community groups or agencies. It encompasses neighborhood -based, grassroots empowerment models using action planning and collaborative systems planning Environmental Strategies establish or changes written and unwritten community standards, codes, and attitudes. The intent is to influence the general population's use of alcohol and other drugs. States should use a variety of strategies that target populations with different levels of risk. Specifically, prevention str ategies can be classified using the IOM Model of Universal, Selective, and Indicated, which classifies preventive interventions by targeted population. The definitions for these population classifications are: Universal: The general public or a whole population group that has not been identified based on individual risk. Selective: Individuals or a subgroup of the population whose risk of developing a disorder is significantly higher than average. Indicated: Individuals in high -risk environments that have minimal but detectable signs or symptoms foreshadowing disorder or have biological markers indicating predispositions for disorder but do not yet meet diagnostic levels. It is important to note that classifications of preventive interventions by strategy and by IOM category are not mutually exc lusive, as strategy classification indicates the type of activity while IOM classification indicates the populations served by the activity. Federal regulation requires states to use prevention set -aside funding to implement substance abuse prevention interventions in all six strategies. SAMHSA also recommends that prevention set -aside funding be used to target populations with all levels of risk: universal, indicated, and selective populations. While the primary prevention set -aside of the SABG must be used only for primary substance abuse prevention activities, it is important to note that many evidence -based substance abuse prevention programs have a positive impact not only on the prevention of substance use and abuse, but also on other health and social outcomes such as education, juvenile justice involvement, violence prevention, and mental health. This reflects the fact that substance use and other aspects of behavioral health share many of the same risk and protective factor s. The backbone of an effective prevention system is an infrastructure with the ability to collect and analyze epidemiological d ata on substance use and its associated consequences and use this data to identify areas of greatest need. Good data also enable states to identify, implement, and evaluate evidence -based programs, practices, and policies that have the ability to reduce substance use and improve health and well -being in communities. In particular, SAMHSA strongly encourages states to use data collected and analyzed by their SEOWs to help make data - driven funding decisions. Consistent with states using data to guide their funding decisions, SAMHSA encourages states to look closely at the data on opioid/prescription drug abuse, as well as underage use of legal substances, such as alcohol, and marijuana in those states w here its use has been legalized. SAMHSA also encourages states to use data -driven approaches to allocate funding to communities with fewer resources and the greatest behavioral health needs. SAMHSA expects that state substance abuse agencies have the ability to implement the five steps of the strategic prevention f ramework (SPF) or District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 111 of 194an equivalent planning model that encompasses these steps: Assess prevention needs;1. Build capacity to address prevention needs;2. Plan to implement evidence -based strategies that address the risk and protective factors associated with the identified needs; 3. Implement appropriate strategies across the spheres of influence (individual, family, school, community, environment) that re duce substance abuse and its associated consequences; and4. Evaluate progress towards goals.5. States also need to be prepared to report on the outcomes of their efforts on substance abuse - related attitudes and behaviors. This means that state -funded prevention providers will need to be able to collect data and report this information to the state. With limited resources, states should also look for opportunities to leverage different streams of funding to create a coordinated data driven substance abu se prevention system. SAMHSA expects that states coordinate the use of all substance abuse prevention funding in the state, including the primary p revention set-aside of the SABG, discretionary SAMHSA grants such as the Partnerships for Success (PFS) grant, and other federal, state, an d local prevention dollars, toward common outcomes to strive to create an impact in their state 's use, misuse or addiction metrics. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state's system: Please indicate if the state has an active SEOW. If so, please describe: 1. The types of data collected by the SEOW (i.e. incidence of substance use, consequences of substance use, and intervening variables, including risk and protective factors); The populations for which data is collected (i.e., children, youth, young adults, adults, older adults, minorities, rural communities); and The data sources used (i.e. archival indicators, NSDUH, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, Monitoring the Future, Communities that Care, state -developed survey). Please describe how needs assessment data is used to make decisions about the allocation of SABG primary prevention funds.2. How does the state intend to build the capacity of its prevention system, including the capacity of its prevention workforce? 3. Please describe if the state has: 4. A statewide licensing or certification program for the substance abuse prevention workforce;a.

Quality Improvement Plan Narrative Question: In previous block grant applications, SAMHSA asked states to base their administrative operations and service delivery on pri nciples of Continuous Quality Improvement/Total Quality Management (CQI/TQM). These CQI processes should identify and track critical outcomes and performance measures, based on valid and reliable data, consistent with the NBHQF, which will describe the health and functio ning of the mental health and addiction systems. The CQI processes should continuously measure the effectiveness of services and supports and ensure that they continue to reflect this evidence of effectiveness. The state's CQI process should also track programmatic improvem ents using stakeholder input, including the general population and individuals in treatment and recovery and their families. In addition, the CQI plan should include a description of the process for responding to emergencies, critical incidents, complaints, and grievances. In an attachment to this application, states should submit a CQI plan for FY 2016 -FY 2017. Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section.

Trauma Narrative Question: Trauma 75 is a widespread, harmful and costly public health problem. It occurs as a result of violence, abuse, neglect, loss, disaster, war and other emotionally harmful experiences. Trauma has no boundaries with regard to age, gender, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, geography, or sexual orientation. It is an almost universal experience of people with mental and substance use difficulties. The need to address trauma is increasingly viewed as an important component of effective behavioral health service delivery. Additionally, it has become evident that addressing trauma requires a multi -pronged, multi -agency public health approach inclusive of public education and awareness, prevention and early identification, and effective trauma -specific assessment and treatment. To maximize the impact of these efforts, they need to be provided in an organizational or community context that is trauma -informed, that is, based on the knowledge and understanding of trauma and its far - reaching implications. The effects of traumatic events place a heavy burden on individuals, families and communities and create challenges for publi c institutions and service systems 76. Although many people who experience a traumatic event will go on with their lives without lasting negative effects, others will have more difficulty and experience traumatic stress reactions. Emerging research has documented the relationships among exposure to traumatic events, impaired neurodevelopmental and immune systems responses, and subsequent health risk behaviors resulting in chronic physical or behavioral health disorders. Research has also indicated that with appropriate supports and intervention, people can overcome traumatic experiences. However, most people go without these services and supports. Individuals with experiences of trauma are found in multiple service sectors, not just in behavioral health. People in the juvenile and criminal justice system have high rates of mental illness and substance use disorders and personal histories of trauma. Children and families in the child welfare system similarly experience high rates of trauma and associated behavioral health problems. Many patients in primary, specialty, emergency and rehabilitative health care similarly have significant trauma histories, which has an impact on their health and their responsiveness to health interventions. In addition, the public institutions and service systems that are intended to provide services and supports for individuals a re often themselves re - traumatizing, making it necessary to rethink doing \"business as usual. \" These public institutions and service settings are increasingly adopting a trauma -informed approach guided by key principles of safety, trustworthiness and transparency, peer support, empowerment, collaborat ion, and sensitivity to cultural and gender issues, and incorporation of trauma -specific screening, assessment, treatment, and recovery practices. To meet the needs of those they serve, states should take an active approach to addressing trauma. Trauma screening matched with trauma - specific therapies, such as exposure therapy or trauma -focused cognitive behavioral approaches, should be used to ensure that treatments meet the needs of those being served. States should also consider adopting a trauma -informed approach consistent with \"SAMHSA 's Concept of Trauma and Guidance for a Trauma -Informed Approach \". 77 This means providing care based on an understanding of the vulnerabilities or triggers of trauma survivors that traditional service delivery approaches may exacerbate, so that these services and programs can be supportive and avoid traumatizing the individuals again. It is suggested that the states uses SAMHSA 's guidance for implementing the trauma -informed approach discussed in the Concept of Trauma 78 paper. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state 's system: Does the state have policies directing providers to screen clients for a personal history of trauma and to connect individual s to trauma - focused therapy?1. Describe the state 's policies that promote the provision of trauma -informed care. 2. How does the state promote the use of evidence -based trauma -specific interventions across the lifespan? 3. Does the state provide trainings to increase capacity of providers to deliver trauma -specific interventions? 4.

Trauma One of the ways that DBH promotes trauma -informed care is through the Child and Youth Services Division Evidence -based Practices initiative called Families First. This is a collaborative effort with the Child and Families Services Agency. At the heart of the Families First program is a commitment to keeping families together, providing community -based treatments proven to work and preventing children from being placed into out -of-home programs. Families First brings together a range of family -centered mental health treatment and supports appropriate for different age groups. These Evidence -Based Practices are proven to strengthen family life, meet the needs of the children and youth and families who experience depression, anxiety and acting out behavior in reaction to trauma and violence, and help avoid more complex, long -term challenges. District children, youth and their families (including biological, foster and adoptive families and caregivers) and children and youth who are wards of the District living in Maryland and Virginia are eligible for these specialized treatment programs. The Families First services are provided by qualified designated community -based providers who receive comprehensive training and coaching in treatment models t hat have demonstrated positive outcomes such as restoring responsible behavior for troubled children, helping family members deal with traumatic histories, and improving family interactions. The current evidence -based and evidence supported practices incl ude: 1) Child Parent Psychotherapy for Family Violence; 2) Trauma Systems Therapy; 3) Parent Child Interaction Therapy; 4) Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; 5) Multi -Systemic Therapy; 6) Multi -Systemic Therapy for Youth with Problem Sexual Behav ior; 7) Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach; and 8) Transition to Independence Process. Evidence Based Associates (EBA) is the DBH contractor that assists with developing and sustaining trauma -related and other evidence -based practices. The EBA se rvices include: provider: 1) pre -implementation readiness; 2) training; 3) coaching and implementation; 4) data tracking; and 5) fidelity monitoring. EBA also supports the development of the annual Evidence -Based Practices Conference that started in 2011.

Criminal and Juvenile Justice Narrative Question: More than half of all prison and jail inmates meet criteria for having mental health problems, six in ten meet criteria for a substance use problem, and more than one third meet criteria for having co -occurring substance abuse and mental health problems. Successful diversion from or re - entering the community from detention, jails, and prisons is often dependent on engaging in appropriate substance use and/or mental health treatment. Some states have implemented such efforts as mental health, veteran and drug courts, crisis intervention training and re -entry programs to help reduce arrests, imprisonment and recidivism.79 The SABG and MHBG may be especially valuable in supporting care coordination to promote pre -adjudication or pre -sentencing diversion, providing care during gaps in enrollment after incarceration, and supporting other efforts related to enrollment. Communities across the United States have instituted problem -solving courts, including those for defendants with mental and substance use disorders. These courts seek to prevent incarceration and facilitate community -based treatment for offenders, while at the same time protecting public safety. There are two types of problem -solving courts related to behavioral health: drug courts and mental health courts. In addition to these behavioral health problem -solving courts, some jurisdictions operate courts specifically for DWI/DUI, veterans, families, and reentry, as well as court s for gambling, domestic violence, truancy, and other subject -specific areas.80 81 Rottman described the therapeutic value of problem -solving courts: \"Specialized courts provide a forum in which the adversarial process can be relaxed and problem -solving and treatment processes emphasized. Specialized courts can be structured to retain jurisdiction over defendants, promoting the continuity of supervision and acco untability of defendants for their behavior in treatment programs.\" Youths in the juvenile justice system often display a variety of high -risk characteristics that include inadequate family support, school failure, negative peer associations, and insufficient use of community -based services. Most adjudicated youth released from secure detention do not have community follow -up or supervision; therefore, risk factors remain unaddressed.82 Expansions in insurance coverage will mean that many individuals in jails and prisons, who generally have not had health cove rage in the past, will now be able to access behavioral health services. Addressing the behavioral health needs of these individuals can reduce recidivism, improve public safety, reduce criminal justice expenditures, and improve coordination of care for a population that disproportionatel y experiences costly chronic physical and behavioral health conditions. Addressing these needs can also reduce health care system utilization and improve broader health outcomes. Achieving these goals will require new efforts in enrollment, workforce development, screening for risks and needs, and implementing appropriate treatment and recovery services. This will also involve coordination across Medicaid, criminal and j uvenile justice systems, SMHAs, and SSAs. A diversion program places youth in an alternative program, rather than processing them in the juvenile justice system. State s should place an emphasis on screening, assessment, and services provided prior to adjudication and/or sentencing to divert persons with menta l and/or substance use disorders from correctional settings. States should also examine specific barriers such as a lack of identifica tion needed for enrollment; loss of eligibility resulting from incarceration; and care coordination for individuals with chronic health condi tions, housing instability, and employment challenges. Secure custody rates decline when community agencies are present to advocate for alte rnatives to detention. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state's system: Are individuals involved in, or at risk of involvement in, the criminal and juvenile justice system enrolled in Medicaid as a part of coverage expansions? 1. Are screening and services provided prior to adjudication and/or sentencing for individuals with mental and/or substance use disorders? 2. Do the SMHA and SSA coordinate with the criminal and juvenile justice systems with respect to diversion of individuals with m ental and/or substance use disorders, behavioral health services provided in correctional facilities and the reentry process for th ose individuals?3. Are cross -trainings provided for behavioral health providers and criminal/juvenile justice personnel to increase capacity for working w ith individuals with behavioral health issues involved in the justice system?4.

The DBH adult forensic outpatient services include: 1) pre -trial and re -entry services; 2) Court Urgent Care Clinic services (individuals are in immediate need of mental health and/or substance use disorder services); 3) DBH staff located at the jail to provide screening and linkage to services; 4) DBH provider programs that provide services; and 5) DBH Re -entry Coordinator placed at the D.C. Jail Women's Facility to assist women with mental health and/or substance use disorder issues being linked prior to discharge with the appropriate service provider. The Juvenile Behavioral Diversion Program (JBDP) began in January 2011 and operates within the D.C. Superior Court Juvenile Division. This voluntary program links and engages juveniles in appropriate community -based mental health services and supports. Court -involved juvenile status offenders are given the op tion of participating in mental health services rather than being prosecuted. The goal is to reduce behavioral symptoms that may contribute to juveniles' involvement with the criminal justice system and to improve their functioning in the home, school, and community. This program is intended for children and youth who are often served within multiple systems who are at risk of re -offending without linkage to mental health services and other important supports. Participants are enrolled from six (6) months t o a year and are required to attend regular court monitoring meetings and participate in mental health services. The capacity for JBDP has been 60 since its inception and based upon a request from the Court, it was expanded to 75 in 2015.

State Parity Efforts Narrative Question: MHPAEA generally requires group health plans and health insurance issuers to ensure that financial requirements and treatment limitations applied to M/SUD benefits are no more restrictive than the requirements or limitations applied to medical/surgical benefits. The legislation applies to both private and public sector employer plans that have more than 50 employees, including both self -insured and fully insured arrangements. MHPAEA also applies to health insurance issuers that sell coverage to employers with more than 50 employees. The Affordable Care Act extends these requirements to issuers selling individual market coverage. Small group and individual issuers partici pating in the Marketplaces (as well as most small group and individual issuers outside the Marketplaces) are required to offer EHBs, which are required by statute to include services for M/SUDs and behavioral health treatment - and to comply with MHPAEA. Guidance was released for states in January 2013.83 MHPAEA requirements also apply to Medicaid managed care, alternative benefit plans, and CHIP. ASPE estimates that more than 6 0 million Americans will benefit from new or expanded mental health and substance abuse coverage under parity requirements. However, pu blic awareness about MHPAEA has been limited. Recent research suggests that the public does not fully understand how behavioral he alth benefits function, what treatments and services are covered, and how MHPAEA affects their coverage.84 Parity is vital to ensuring persons with mental health conditions and substance use disorders receive continuous, coordinated , care. Increasing public awareness about MHPAEA could increase access to behavioral health services, provide financial benefits to individuals and families, and lead to reduced confusion and discrimination associated with mental illness and substance use disorders. Block grant recipients should continue to monitor federal parity regulations and guidance and collaborate with state Medicaid authorities, insurance regulators, ins urers, employers, providers, consumers and policymakers to ensure effective parity implementation and comprehensive, consistent communication w ith stakeholders. SSAs, SMHAs and their partners may wish to pursue strategies to provide information, education, and technical assistance on parity -related issues. Medicaid programs will be a key partner for recipients of MHBG and SABG funds and providers supported by these funds. SMHAs and SSAs should collaborate with their state's Medicaid authority in ensuring parity within Medicaid programs. SAMHSA encourages states to take proactive steps to improve consumer knowledge about parity. As one plan of action, states ca n develop communication plans to provide and address key issues. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state's system: What fiscal resources are used to develop communication plans to educate and raise awareness about parity? 1. Does the state coordinate across public and private sector entities to increase consumer awareness and understanding about be nefits of the law (e.g., impacts on covered benefits, cost sharing, etc.)?2. Does the state coordinate across public and private sector entities to increase awareness and understanding among health plan s and health insurance issuers of the requirements of MHPAEA and related state parity laws and to provide technical assistance as n eeded?3.

Medication Assisted Treatment Narrative Question: There is a voluminous literature on the efficacy of FDA -approved medications for the treatment of substance use disorders. However, many treatment programs in the U.S. offer only abstinence -based treatment for these conditions. The evidence base for medication -assisted treatment of these disorders is described in SAMHSA TIPs 4085, 4386, 4587, and 4988. SAMHSA strongly encourages the states to require that treatment facilities providing clinical care to those with substance use disorders be required to either have the capacity and staff ex pertise to use MAT or have collaborative relationships with other providers such that these MATs can be accessed as clinically indicated for patien t need. Individuals with substance use disorders who have a disorder for which there is an FDA -approved medication treatment should have access to those treatments based upon each individual patient's needs. SAMHSA strongly encourages states to require the use of FDA -approved MATs for substance use disorders where clinically indicated (opioid use disorders with evidence of physical dependence, alcohol use disorders, tobacco use disorders) and particularly in cases of re lapse with these disorders. SAMHSA is asking for input from states to inform SAMHSA's activities. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state's system: How will or can states use their dollars to develop communication plans to educate and raise awareness within substance abuse treatment programs and the public regarding medication -assisted treatment for substance use disorders? 1. What steps and processes can be taken to ensure a broad and strategic outreach is made to the appropriate and relevant audien ces that need access to medication -assisted treatment for substance use disorders, particularly pregnant women?2. What steps will the state take to assure that evidence -based treatments related to the use of FDA -approved medications for treatment of substance use disorders are used appropriately (appropriate use of medication for the treatment of a substance use disorder, combining psychosocial treatments with medications, use of peer supports in the recovery process, safeguards against misuse and/or dive rsion of controlled substances used in treatment of substance use disorders, advocacy with state payers)?3.

Crisis Services Narrative Question: In the on -going development of efforts to build an evidence -based robust system of care for persons diagnosed with SMI, SED and addictive disorders and their families via a coordinated continuum of treatments, services and supports, growing attention is being pai d across the country to how states and local communities identify and effectively respond to, prevent, manage and help individuals, famili es, and communities recover from behavioral health crises. SAMHSA has taken a leadership role in deepening the understanding of what it means to be in crisis and how to respond to a cr isis experienced by people with behavioral health conditions and their families. According to SAMHSA's publication, Practice Guidelines: Core Elements for Responding to Mental Health Crises89 , \"Adults, children, and older adults with an SMI or emotional disorder often lead lives characterized by recurrent, significan t crises. These crises are not the inevitable consequences of mental disability, but rather represent the combined impact of a host of additional factors, including lack of access to essential services and supports, poverty, unstable housing, coexisting substance use, other health problems, discrimination and victimization.\" A crisis response system will have the capacity to prevent, recognize, respond, de -escalate, and follow -up from crises across a continuum, from crisis planning, to early stages of support and respite, to crisis stabilization and intervention, to post -crisis follow -up and support for the individual and their family. SAMHSA expects that states will build on the emerging and growing body of evidence for effective community - based crisis -prevention and response systems. Given the multi -system involvement of many individuals with behavioral health issues, the crisis system approach provides the infrastructure to improve care coordination and outcomes, manage costs and better invest resourc es. The array of services and supports being used to address crisis response include the following: Crisis Prevention and Early Intervention: Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) Crisis Planning Psychiatric Advance Directives Family Engagement Safety Planning Peer-Operated Warm Lines Peer-Run Crisis Respite Programs Suicide Prevention Crisis Intervention/Stabilization: Assessment/Triage (Living Room Model) Open Dialogue Crisis Residential/Respite Crisis Intervention Team/ Law Enforcement Mobile Crisis Outreach Collaboration with Hospital Emergency Departments and Urgent Care Systems Post Crisis Intervention/Support: WRAP Post -Crisis Peer Support/Peer Bridgers Follow -Up Outreach and Support Family -to-Family engagement Connection to care coordination and follow -up clinical care for individuals in crisis Follow -up crisis engagement with families and involved community members Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section.

Crisis Services Child and Youth Crisis Service : This service is called the Children and Adolescent Mobile Psychiatric Service (ChAMPS). FY 2015 is year 7 of operation for ChAMPS via DBH contract with Catholic Charities of Washington Behavioral Health Services. The purpose is to provide immediate access to mobile emergency services for children, youth and families experiencing a behavioral or mental health crisis. The service is a vailable 24 hours, 7days a week for children and youth ages 6 to 18, except for youth who are committed to the Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA) who are served until age 21. The mobile team: 1) provides on -site crisis assessments to determine the men tal health stability of a youth and their ability to remain safe in the community; 2) assists in the coordination of acute care assessments and hospitalizations when appropriate; and 3) post -crisis follow -up interventions are conducted up to 30 days after the initial crisis intervention to ensure linkage to DBH mental health providers for ongoing treatment. As of June 2015, the quarterly average number of child ren/youth served was 225. The unduplicated number served during this period was 726. Adult Crisis Services : These services include community crisis stabilization beds and the Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program (CPEP ). Crisis Stabilization Beds: DBH contracts with two (2) community providers for 15 crisis stabilization beds. There are eight (8) beds at Jordan House and seven (7) beds at Crossing Place. As of June 2015, the average quarterly crisis stabilization bed utilization rate was 88.90%. The Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program (CPEP) is a 24 -hour specialty psychiatric unit resp onsible for assessing and treating individuals with acute and chronic mental illness in or pending psychiatric crisis. It has three (3) components: 1) Psychiatric Emergency Services, 2) Mobile Crisis Services, and 3) Homeless Outreach Program. Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES): Medical treatment is available for common medical problems and limited medical testing is conducted. CPEP accepts voluntary patients who come on their own or accompanied by family, friends or healthcare professionals; and involun tary patients from community settings who are referred by law enforcement, physicians, psychologists or officer -agents. Each patient receives a nursing assessment and a psychiatric evaluation; depending on the clinical presentation, most have a psychosocia l assessment and a medical screening. Once a psychiatric evaluation is completed, the patient may be discharged immediately, kept at CPEP for stabilization (up to 72 hours in the Extended Observation Bed unit) or referred for psychiatric hospitalization. A s of June 2015, 1,935 unduplicated individuals out of 2,769 visited PES. Mobile Crisis Services (MCS ): Provides services to adults experiencing a psychiatric crisis in the community including at home, office or any public area. The team acts quickly as a first responder to adults who are unable or unwilling to travel to receive mental health services and may provide in -field psychiatric assessment, bilingual clinical consultation , medication management , linkages to on going services , and f ollow -up services to assure stability . The team also responds to critical incidents including tragedies and disasters throughout the District. As of June 2015 , 861 unduplicated individuals out of 968 received a team visit.

Its primary purpose is to provide a variety of mental health outreach services and supports to adults and families who are homeless. These services include: m ental health assessments , crisis intervention , care coordina tion between mental health agencies , and r eferrals to other services . As of June 2015 , 472 unduplicated persons received engagement services out of 1,541. The HOP also provides consultati on and training to the provider network working most closely with this population. Technical Assistance through SAMHSA - In May 2015, DBH developed a technical assistance request through the SAMHSA TA Tracker to evaluate and develop strategies to enhance the quality of service delivery and therapeutic efficiency of CPEP's three (3) complementary programs (PES, MCS, and HOP). Other goals included: 1) a review of the literature and/or examples of other state/jurisdiction operation of urban emergency psychiatric services, including the use of evidence -based practices, outcome s and limitations; and 2) development of strategies and roadmap for CPEP to incorporate relevant evidence -based practices and tools into psychiatric care delivery, thereby improving quality and enhancing staff development. The TA request was approved in June 2015. Mark Engelhardt , an expert in both crisis services and homelessness , was the assigned consultant. There was an exchange of documents, a planning conference call, and a 2 -day site visit August 6 -7, 2015. The consultant report was received at the en d of August and was very positive with some short -term follow -up actions.

Recovery Narrative Question: The implementation of recovery -based approaches is imperative for providing comprehensive, quality behavioral health care. The expansion in access to and coverage for health care compels SAMHSA to promote the availability, quality, and financing of vital services a nd support systems that facilitate recovery for individuals. Recovery encompasses the spectrum of individual needs related to those with mental disorders and/or substance use disorders. Recovery is supported through the key components of health (access to quality health and behavioral health treatment), home (housing with needed supports), purpose (education, employment, and other pursuits), and community (peer, family, and other social supports). The principles of recovery guide the approach to person -centered care that is inclusive of shared decision -making. The continuum of care for these conditions includes psychiatric and psychosocial interventions to address acute episodes or recurrence of symptoms associated with an in dividual 's mental or substance use disorder. This includes the use of psychotropic or other medications for mental illnesses or addictions to a ssist in the diminishing or elimination of symptoms as needed. Further, the use of psychiatric advance directives is encouraged to provide an individual the opportunity to have an active role in their own treatment even in times when the severity of their symptoms may impair cognit ion significantly. Resolution of symptoms through acute care treatment contributes to the stability necessary for individuals to pursue their on going recovery and to make use of SAMHSA encouraged recovery resources. SAMHSA has developed the following working definition of recovery from mental and/or substance use disorders: Recovery is a process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self -directed life, and strive to reach their full potential. In addition, SAMHSA identified 10 guiding principles of recovery: Recovery emerges from hope; Recovery is person -driven; Recovery occurs via many pathways; Recovery is holistic; Recovery is supported by peers and allies; Recovery is supported through relationship and social networks; Recovery is culturally -based and influenced; Recovery is supported by addressing trauma; Recovery involves individuals, families, community strengths, and responsibility; Recovery is based on respect. Please see SAMHSA's Working Definition of Recovery from Mental Disorders and Substance Use Disorders . States are strongly encouraged to consider ways to incorporate recovery support services, including peer -delivered services, into their continuum of care. Examples of evidence -based and emerging practices in peer recovery support services include, but are not limited to, the following: District of Columbia Page 1 of 3 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 128 of 194employment SAMHSA encourages states to take proactive steps to implement recovery support services, and is seeking input from states to address this position. To accomplish this goal and support the wide -scale adoption of recovery supports in the areas of health, home, purpose, and community, SAMHSA has launched Bringing Recovery Supports to Scale Technical Assistance Center Strategy (BRSS TACS). BRSS TAC S assists states and others to promote adoption of recovery -oriented supports, servic es, and systems for people in recovery from substance use and/or mental disorders. Recovery is based on the involvement of consumers/peers and their family members. States should work to support and help stre ngthen existing consumer, family, and youth networks; recovery organizations; and community peer support and advocacy organizations in expanding self-advocacy, self -help programs, support networks, and recovery support services. There are many activities that SMHAs and SSAs can undertake to engage these individuals and families. In the space below, states should describe their efforts to engage indivi duals and families in developing, implementing and monitoring the state mental health and substance abuse treatment system. Please consider the following items as a guideline when preparing the description of the state's system: Does the state have a plan that includes: the definition of recovery and recovery values, evidence of hiring people in recove ry leadership roles, strategies to use person -centered planning and self -direction and participant -directed care, variety of recovery services and supports (i.e., peer support, recovery support coaching, center services, supports for self -directed care, peer navigators, consumer/family education, etc.)?1. How are treatment and recovery support services coordinated for any individual served by block grant funds?2. Does the state's plan include peer -delivered services designed to meet the needs of specific populations, such as veterans and military families, people with a history of trauma, members of racial/ethnic groups, LGBT populations, and families/significant others ?3. Does the state provide or support training for the professional workforce on recovery principles and recovery -oriented practice and systems, including the role of peer providers in the continuum of services? Does the state have an accreditation program, cer tification program, or standards for peer -run services?4. Does the state conduct empirical research on recovery supports/services identification and dissemination of best practices in recovery supports/services or other innovative and exemplary activities that support the implementation of recovery -oriented approaches, and services within the state 's behavioral health system?5. Describe how individuals in recovery and family members are involved in the planning, delivery, and evaluation of behavioral health services (e.g., meetings to address concerns of individuals and families, opportunities for individuals and families to be pr oactive in treatment and recovery planning).6. Does the state support, strengthen, and expand recovery organizations, family peer advocacy, self -help programs, support networks, and recovery -oriented services?7. Provide an update of how you are tracking or measuring the impact of your consumer outreach activities.8. Describe efforts to promote the wellness of individuals served including tobacco cessation, obesity, and other co -morbid health conditions.9.

Community Living and the Implementation of Olmstead Narrative Question: The integration mandate in Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Supreme Court's decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), provide legal requirements that are consistent with SAMHSA's mission to reduce the impact of substance abuse and mental illne ss on America's communities. Being an active member of a community is an important part of recovery for persons with behavioral health conditions. Title II of the ADA and the regulations promulgated for its enforcement require that states provide services in t he most integrated arrangement appropriate and prohibit needless institutionalization and segregation in work, living, and other settings. In re sponse to the 10th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Olmstead decision, the Coordinating Council on Community Living was created at HHS. SAMHSA has been a key member of the council and has funded a number of technical assistance opportunities to promote integrated services for people with behavioral health needs, including a policy academy to share effective practices with states. Community living has been a priority across the federal government with recent changes to Section 811 and other housing progr ams operated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD and HHS collaborate to support housing opportunities for person s with disabilities, including persons with behavioral illnesses. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the HHS Office of Civil Rights (OCR) cooperate on enforcement and compliance measures. DOJ and OCR have expressed concern about some aspects of state mental health systems inc luding use of traditional institutions and other residences that have institutional characteristics to house persons whose needs could b e better met in community settings. More recently, there has been litigation regarding certain supported employment services such as sheltere d workshops. States should ensure block grant funds are allocated to support prevention, treatment, and recovery services in community set tings whenever feasible and remain committed, as SAMHSA is, to ensuring services are implemented in accordance with Olmstead and Title II of the ADA. It is requested that the state submit their Olmstead Plan as a part of this application, or address the following when descri bing community living and implementation of Olmstead: Describe the state's Olmstead plan including housing services provided, home and community based services provided through Medicaid, peer support services, and employment services.1. How are individuals transitioned from hospital to community settings?2. What efforts are occurring in the state or being planned to address the ADA community integration mandate required by the Olm stead Decision of 1999?3.

District of Columbia Page 1 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Community For All\" Page 1 DC\u2014One Community For All An Olmstead Community Integration Plan Prepared by the DC Office of Disability Rights Introduction and Background On June 22, 1999, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, that the unjustified segre gation or isolation of people with disabilities in institutions may constitute discrimination based on disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Accordingly, the Court held that the ADA requires that States provide community -based treatment for persons with disabilities \"when the State's treatment professionals determine that such placement is appropriate, the affected persons do not oppose such treatment, and the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the States and the needs of others with . . . disabilities.\" 527 U.S. at 607. In light of this decision, the District instituted a comprehensive working plan to serve qualified individuals with disabilities in accordance with the Sup reme Court's holding in Olmstead . This plan establishes certai n goals of the District to ensure that community - based treatment is provided to persons with disabilities, when such treatment is appropriate. However, this plan does not create independent lega l obligations on the part of the District. Mayor Vincent Gray and a wide range of District stakeholders including persons with disabilities directed and supported the Office of Disability Rights to develop the Olmstead Community Integration Plan in accord ance with policies and procedures outlined in D.C. Act 16 -595 the Disability Rights Protection Act of 2006. The District values its residents with disabilities as contributing members of society and understands the cost -effective benefits of supporting the m with integrated, community -based services. The DC Olmstead Community Integration Plan, One Community for All is a policy document that details the rights of each person with a disability to self - determination in the District of Columbia. One Community f or All endeavors to meet the needs and preferences of the individual while allowing him or her to choose where s/he wants to live in the community with the appropriate supports and services consistent with the Olmstead decision and the resources available to the District to serve such individuals, taking into account the needs of others. The Plan is a living document, providing specific goals, action steps, and tools, while allowing for better flexibility and improved services for individuals with disabilit ies. Nine (9) District agencies participating in this initiative are responsible for implementing the Plan. These District agencies include: Office of the State Superintendent for Education (OSSE), Office on Aging (DCOA), Department of Youth Rehabilitatio n District of Columbia Page 2 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Community For All\" Page 2 Services (DYRS), Department of Disability Services (DDS), Department of Human Services (DHS), Department of Behavioral Health (D BH), Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA), DC Public Schools (DCPS) and the Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF). These agencies are collaborating in the hope that the District of Columbia will become a national model for providing community services and supports to persons with disabilities. The Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 Plan For Fiscal Year 2015 (FY '15) , the District's Plan will focus on the programs , services, and outc omes of the following agencies: DC Office on Aging (DCOA) ; Department of Behavioral Health (DBH); Department on Disability Services (DDS); and Department of Healthcare Finance (DHCF) . The above -named agencies provide direct service to a quantifiable population of District residents individually and with other District agencies and community partners . This year's Plan seeks to highlight collaboration among these agencies, as well as the Plan's remaining five ( 5) participating agencies, to illustrate the wrap -around , holistic approach to support provided by the District to individuals with d isabilities who are transitioning into the community of their choice . This year's Plan is designed to specifically address how these agencies carry out the Primary Service Agency Priorities set forth in the original iteration of DC \u2014One Community for Al l published in April 2012. .i The FY '15 Plan contains benchmarks for each of the above agencies. Each agency will report qu arterly on the number of individuals with disabilities it has assisted in transition. Moreover, each agency will report on any qualitative measures it has taken to promote and support successful integration into community life for people with disabilities . These types of measures will include, but are not limited to the following: Outreach and training; Internal and external agency publications; Development of transition -relevant new community partnerships; Fostering of existing transition -relevant commun ity partnerships; and Opportunities for input from persons with disabilities being served. Last, the FY '15 Olmstead Plan will explore avenues to address the most prevalent barrier to successful, lasting transition for the disability community \u2014accessible, affordable housing. To facilitate this effort, the DC Housing Authority (DCHA) and DC District of Columbia Page 3 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Page 3 Housing and Community Development (DHCD) will participate or provide comment on all District -wide ho using issues related to DC's Olmstead Plan.

When does your agency consider an individual to be \"institutionalized\" under the auspices of the Olmstead mandate? The nursing home transition and hospital discharge team s define \"institutionalized\" as 91 d ays or more. 2. What policies/procedures does your Agency utilize for identifying individuals ready and invested for transition into the community? The Agency receives referrals from individuals seeking services, family caregiver s, healthcare professional s, or nursing home social worker s. When an individual expresses interest in transitional assistance, a referral is sent to Information and Assistance. The r eferral is assigned to a transition care specialist. In addition , there is a screening done by the Transition Care Specialist for potential M oney Follows the Person and A ging and Disability Resource Center Nursing Home Transition clients. The screening tool determines if the client is eligible for either nursing home transition through Money Follows the Person (MFP) (client must be a Medicaid beneficiary, be assessed at a nursing home level of care, and have viable housing or a housing voucher) or Aging Disability Resource Center (ADRC) (client does not meet the MFP eligibility requirements, but has expr essed interest in leaving a nursing facility) . If the client is eligible for MFP, he/she will be assigned a n MFP Transition Care Coordinator. If the client is not eligible for MFP, but expresses interest in transitioning out of a nursing facility, he/she will be assigned a Transition Care Specialist on the Nursing Home Transition team . 3. How do you communicate with your target population and their families/caregivers/advocates/providers about community -based options? DCO A has a community outreach team that conducts outreach at various sites including Senior Wellness Centers, churches, and community events. The target population is also reached via DC Office on Aging website. District of Columbia Page 7 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Page 7 The hospital discharge team communicates directly with our targeted population and their support system via hospital visits, home visits, telephone , and/or email. This team also conducts hospital discharge planning presentations at local hospitals. 4. What procedures or policies do you have in place to allow people with disabilities to assess the quality of the supports they receive? The procedures and policies for persons with disabilities, ages 18 -59, is the same as persons 60 and older. Once w e have received a case, reviewed options, and linked the individual with necessary resource s, we provide case management services for 90 days. After 90 days , a customer satification survey is completed. 5. What measures has your agency taken to address the needs of the following: a. Children who receive residential services from District agencies but live outside the District of Columbia. DC Office on Aging does not provide services to children who receive residential services from local DC agencies. b. Adults who receive residential service s from District agencies but reside outside the District o f Columbia. The Nursing Home Transition Team and the Hospital Discharge Team assists adults who have been in a hospital or nursing facility outside the District of Columbia if they have been in the hospitals and nursing facility for 90 days or more, receiv e community -based Medicaid, and desire to transition back into the District of Columbia. However, if a person does not have Medicaid, both of these teams would work with staff, providing Options Counseling to the individual to inform them of potential res ources. Options Counseling provides person -centered counseling to individuals, family members and/or significant others with support in their long -term care decisions to determine appropriate choices. During this process, a written action plan for receivin g community resources is developed based on an individual's needs, preferences, values, and circumstances. Follow -up is provided by option counselors to ensure service delivery and customer satisfaction.

Recommend community services and supports that allow an individual to select services and supports designed for their specific needs. b. Develop effective and timely transition plans for individuals who are placed in non -communi ty-based settings. c. Conduct outreach on your services or other participating agencies' services specifically geared toward your service population. DCOA has expanded access to community -based long -term supports for individuals through a memorandum of un derstanding (MOU) with the Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF) to provide a comprehensive interdisciplinary program that organizes, simplifies, and provides a \"one-stop shop\" for access to all public long -term care and support programs. Also DCOA has a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with DHCF and Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) to conduct a preliminary intake of all individuals. In addition DCOA has informal partnerships with Wash ington Hospital Center Mental Health and House Call Programs , Psychi atric Institute of Washington, DC Long term care Ombudsman office , Adult Protective Services, and Senior Service Network. DCOA has an outreach specialist who facilities meeting s with individuals, and/or families interested in transitioning. An ADRC Tran sition Care Specialist prescreens consumers for eligibility, informs individuals about the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities (EPD) Waiver, and provides transition assistance through options counseling individuals , create s a person centered action plan that maps out the services , and provides guidance on community resources to ensure a successful transition back into the community. Addressing Barriers 7. How does your agency address any or all of the following barriers to successful provision of communit y-based supports for individuals with District of Columbia Page 10 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 For All\" Page 10 disabilities? Note: address only those populations applicable to your agency's mission and vision. a. Lack of comprehensive information on the supports and services available b. Impacts of transitioning to life in t he community: discrimination, fear, and stigma. c. Unavailability of support services to assist with daily life for individuals with severe disabilities, such as education, transportation, and employment. i. Challenges include locating affordable and suitabl e housing for homeless hospital patients who are medically stable for discharge, as well as obtaining services for non -Medicaid hospital patients in need of long -term in -home support care. Also, there is a challenge in locating affordable transportation se rvices for the disabled population ages 18 -59. ii. Solution: The Hospital Discharge Planning Team and Nursing Home Transition Team continue s to work closely with our Housing Coordinator to identify affordable housing options for our participants, as well as w ork with identified agencies to assist participants with obtaining necessary personal care aide services (in-home support) as quickly as possible. Participants with disabilities ages 18 -59 needing transportation are referred to Metro Access . d.

District of Columbia Page 12 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Community For B ehavioral Health (DBH) FY 2015 Olmstead Planning Questions and Outline . Setting Priorities 1. When does your agency consider an individual to be \"institutionalized\" under the auspices of the Olmstead mandate? The Department of Behavioral Health defines \"institutionalized\" as 181 days or more. 2. What policies/procedures does your Agency utilize for identifying individuals ready and invested for transition into the community? The Department of Behavioral Health has a number of policies to support a succe ssful transition to the community. These policies include: For youth in Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities (PRTFs) , DBH Policy 200.7 requires a Continued Stay referral. The Continued Stay referral is a clinical packet submitted by the responsibl e District agency which describes the opinion of the treatment team (to include the youth with his/her parent(s)/guardian(s) ) regarding whether or not the youth would benefit from continued treatment within the PRTF or discharge into the community. This po licy supports the work of the DBH staff assigned to work with the youth while they are in a PRTF. The staff participates in monthly treatment team meetings for youth in the PRTF. DBH Policy 525.4 details the practice guidelines for community integration o f consumers in institutional settings. This policy provides guidance to community mental health providers who are required to participate in the discharge planning process for consumers who are in institutional settings. DBH Policy 511.3A TL -174 describe s the procedures by which consumers are screened for placement in a nursing facility (NF) using the Preadmission Screening and Resident Review (PASRR), the review of level of care and appropriateness of a NF for those already in a NF, and the discharge and transition process when NF is no longer indicated in the consumer's level of care. DBH Policy 200.2B TL -178 establishes specific guidelines to ensur e the continuity of care for adult consumers who seek or receive urgent or emergency mental health treatme nt and supports and/or transfer, as well as adults who are discharged to different levels of care within the mental health system. District of Columbia Page 13 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Page 13 3. How do you communicate with your target population and their families/caregivers/advocates/providers about community -based options? The Department operates a 24 hour/7 days a week Access Helpline which links individuals to community based services. The line receives over 60,000 calls per year and is able to link and/or inform callers about the range of community -based service s available to them. In addition, the Department has the following activities: In FY09 , the former Department of Mental health (DMH) through its Office of Consumer and Family Affairs developed a program to utilize individuals who self - identify as mental health clients to assist long term inpatients at Saint Elizabeths Hospital (SEH) transition into the community. The program involves peers in providing 1:1 support and intervention, teaching skills needed to live in the community and being acti ve team memb ers of the evidence -based Critical Time Intervention that assists consumers in their transitions to the community. Among the other supports, services , and resources offered by peers is working with consumers who have been admitted to psychiatric hospita ls including community hospitals, e.g.Psychiatric Institute of Washington, Providence, United Medical Cent er, and SEH . Some of the key activities of these initiatives are as follows: Working with the hospital, community providers , and families to facilita te a smooth transition to the community. Providing the highly regarded Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) services for consumers hospi talized at SEH . WRAP helps individuals who are hospitalized manage their own recovery and health. SEH uses trained peer specialists to facilitate recovery groups. SEH uses peer specialists on medication review panels. For youth at PRTFs , DBH work s with the youth and his/her parent(s)/guardian(s)/family within the PRTFs monthly treatment team meetings. 4. What procedures or po licies do you have in place to allow people with disabilities to assess the quality of the supports they receive? The Peer Transition Specialist Program is designed to assist consumers who have been long term institutionalized at SEH consider and explore community District of Columbia Page 14 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Page 14 living and ultimately assist these consumers in leaving the institutional setting for community -based living. DBH also has a codified grievance procedure available for individuals to use when they feel they have received inadequate or inappropr iate treatment or care. In addition, DBH funds a Peer -run organization, the Consumer Action Network. This organization is responsible for, among other things, conducting regular consumer surveys at the sites in Washington, D.C. where individuals receive care. DBH clinical monitors continue to monitor Transition Age Youth (youth ages 18 - 25) discharged from PRTF into placements outside the District of Columbia when these youths continue to receive District services. 5. What measures has your agency taken to ad dress the needs of the following: a. Children who receive residential service s from District agencies but live outside the District of Columbia. DBH clinical monitors continue to monitor youth discharged from PRTF into placements outside of the District of Columbia when these youth continue to receive District services. Children/youth who live outside of the District of Columbia but who receive District services such as youth in the care and custody of Child and Family Services Administration (CFSA) are eligible for services offered through DBH. b. Adults who receive residential services from District agencies but reside outside the District of Columbia. If adults are being served by another District agency , they are eligible for all DBH services. For e xample, when consumers are transitioning to a nursing home and have been known to DBH, that provider may stay involved with that individual. c. Individuals who are long -term homeless and seeking permanent housing. District of Columbia Page 15 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Page 15 Individuals who are long -term homeless and seeking permanent housing are a priority for a DBH housing voucher. d. Individuals who are soon to be released from jail/juvenile detention facilities. DBH has a structure in place to coordinate service with the Department of Youth and Rehabilitation Servi ces (DYRS). e. Individuals who are receiving services, but still have significant unmet needs which put them at risk of placement in non -community -based settings. DBH's Division of Integrated Care has responsibility for ensuring individuals discharged from psychiatric hospitalization are linked to a community provider within seven (7) to thirty (30) days. DBH has implemented high utilizer meetings for both children and adults to ensure that community services are available to high risk individual s, as well as ensuring that services are well coordinated. f. Individuals not receiving formalized services but who live with a family member unable to support them effectively. DBH offers crisis services available to any District resident. These include mobile crisi s services for adults and youth. These teams of mental health professionals and specialists are available to respond to an individual who is not currently involved with the treatment system. Since police officers are first responders to families that may h ave an individual experiencing a psychiatric crisis in many situations, DBH has worked with the Metropolitan Police Department ( MPD ) to develop the Crisis Intervention Officer (CIO) program. Since 2009 DBH and MPD have trained over 600 MPD officers. In ad dition, the Department operates two mental health clinics that provide same day or urgent care service to any District resident. Interagency Collaboration 6. Explain specifically how your agency works with other participating agencies, District residents, an d community stakeholders. Please identify District of Columbia Page 16 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Community For All\" Page 16 the agency/agencies (Government and Community -based) and consider the following: The DBH Child D ivision works with the Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA), Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services (DYRS), D istrict of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS), Department of Disability Services (DDS), Health Services for Children with Special Needs (HSCSN), the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE), and the District of Columbia Superior Court (DCSC). DBH Adult S ervices has collaborative relationships with Department of Human Services (DHS), Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), Department of Housing Authority (DCHA), Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), Department of Disabilities Admin istration (DDA) , Office on Aging, and the Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF). a. Recommend community services and supports that allow an individual to select services and supports designed for their specific needs . DBH's policies are based on choice a nd selection of providers according to each individual's desire and need. b. Develop effective and timely transition plans for individuals who are placed in non -community -based settings . DBH policies require the community providers to be active participants in working with individuals who are in PRTFs, SEH, and nursing facilities . c. Conduct outreach on your services or other participating agencies' services specifically geared toward your service population. DBH's policies require its provider network to pro vide outreach to individuals who are living in an institutional setting. In addition, DBH has worked with other agencies to offer a session called Family Talk which is intended to inform parents of PRTF treatment, discharge, and community -based services. This session has been supported by numerous agencies (including DCPS, DYRS, OSSE, CFSA, District of Columbia Page 17 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 For All\" Page 17 DHCF, DCSC, and Health Services for Children with Special Needs (HSCN)). Addressing Barriers 7. How does your agency address any or all of the following barriers to succe ssful provision of community -based supports for individuals with disabilities? Note: address only those populations applicable to your agency's mission and vision. a. Lack of comprehensive information on the supports and services available. DBH keeps its webpage up -to-date to inform the community on its supports and services. In addition, we work with community groups such as Consumer Action Network National Alliance on Mental Illness -DC (NAMI), family groups , and peer operated services to provide informat ion on services and supports available through DBH's network. b. Scarcity of accessible, affordable, integrated housing. DBH is committed to the availability of accessible, affordable , integrated housing. The agency provides over 800 housing subsidies a yea r to DBH consumers which are consumer -based, i.e. the consumer can use it for any appropriate housing they choose. Additionally the agency works aggressively to develop accessible, affordable , integrated housing. It has had a partnership with DHCD for the past five years and made more than $26 million available for the development of new or renovated housing units for the exclusive use of our consumers. More than 181 units have been built and are occupied and an additional 155 units are under development. T his is an on -going initiative , and the agency requests additional funding for continued development in its annual budgets. c. Unavailability of support services to assist with daily life for individuals with severe disabilities, such as education, transp ortation, and employment. Through a program called Supported Employment, DBH helps people with mental illness find and keep full or part -time jobs in the community. The District of Columbia Page 18 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Page 18 jobs pay minimum wage or higher and are based on individual interests and abilities. d. Insufficient numbers of compensated, trained employees to work with the population of people with disabilities. The Department of Behavioral Health operates the most comprehensive behavioral health training program in the District, called the DBH Training Institute. The Training Institute produces over 150 training events annually . Topics relate to identified system needs determined by agency goals, compliance/audit data, and other sources including needs identified by mental health clients . e. Post -discharge into community -based living with subsequent assessment that transition is not meeting the needs of the individual. DBH has structure in place to provide support and assistance to providers who are working closely with individuals leaving institutional se ttings. District of Columbia Page 19 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Department on Disability Services (DDS) FY '15 Olmstead Planning Outline Setting Priorities 1. When does your agency consider an individual to be \"institutionalized\" under the auspices of the Olmstead mandate? The Department on Disability Services (\"DDS\"), Developmental Disabilities Administration (\"DDA\") uses 91 days or more for the purposes of the Money Follows the Perso n (\"MFP\") program. However, through policy and proced ure, discussed below, every nursing facility referral for a person who receives supports from DDS/ DDA is reviewed by the DDS Human Rights Advisory Committee (\"HRAC\") , and the agency begins to engage in transition planning for the person to return back to the community immediately, starting from the day of admission. 2. What policies/procedures does your Agency utilize for identifying individuals ready and invested for transition into the community? It is DDS's policy to ensure that all people who receive s upport from the DDA service system have access to and receive quality supports, services, and health care in the most integrated, least restrictive community -based setting appropriate to their needs. This is reflected in a range of policies and procedures including: Human Rights policy and Human Rights Advisory Committee (the Committee) procedure; Individual Support Plan (\"ISP\") policy and procedure; Most Integrated Community Based Setting policy; Out of State Placement policy; and the Nursing Facility Pla cement policy (all available on -line at http://dds.dc.gov/page/policies -and-procedures -dda.) As an example, the DDS Nursing Facility Placement policy defines acceptable uses for nursing f acilities for people with intellectual disabilities who receive supports from DDA as follows: The person has a need for a time -limited stay following hospitalization and his or her rehabilitation requires the availability of skilled nursing staff on a twen ty-four (24) hour basis. The referral and placement must be directly related to a hospitalization discharge recommendation; or The person has a need for medical supports that minimize deterioration in abilities and maximize quality of life and cannot be provided in the individual's current level of care, nor can it be met in a more inte nsive community -based alternative, such as an Intermediate Care Facility for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (\"ICF/IID\"); and facility and District of Columbia Page 20 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 For All\" Page 20 community -based interv entions are currently unavailable to address the person's medical support needs. Additionally, the HRAC reviews each proposed nursing facility placement to determine whether it is the least restrictive and most appropriate setting to meet the person's nee ds. The Committee also establishes the schedule and recommendations for on -going review. All placement decisions are determined based upon the person's asses sed needs and preferences. Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) begins transition pl anning as soon as the person is admitted to a facility to ensure that he or she can return to an integrated, community -based setting , preferably his or her home, as soon as possible, given the person's health condition and need for ongoing medical treatmen t and therapies. At times, a person may be able to return to a more integrated community setting, but may not be able to return to his or her home because he or she needs an increased level of care, or, if given the length of stay in the nursing facility, the person's placement in a particular residential facility is no longer available. Federal Medicaid rules prohibit payment to the person's residential provider for any days when the person is in a nursing facilit y. To ensure that people are able to return to their homes, when appropriate, the Medicaid Home and Community -Based Services Waiver for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (\"HCBS IDD Waiver\") rates do include a vacancy factor so that providers are able to hold a person's pl ace in the home for short -term stays at a hospital, nursing facility, or other institution. Finally, it is DDA's practice to use Person -Centered Thinking (\"PCT\") for all service and support planning. Michael Smull, one of the national experts on PCT, wit h whom DDS is working closely, describes PCT skills as follows: \"At their core all of these skills are about how we can help people who traditionally have led isolated lives, lead ordinary, self -directed lives, within their own communities. The skills are about supporting people as ordinary citizens while recognizing (and accounting for) their unusual support needs.\" http://www.nasddds.org/pdf/importanceofpersoncenteredthink ing5a.pdf . DDA is engaged in implementing PCT throughout not only the agency , but the entire IDD support and service delivery system. DDA currently has five (5) certified PCT trainers on staff, and is training two (2) additional staff members; with add itional trainers planned in FY 2015. These trainers offer District of Columbia Page 21 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 For All\" Page 21 ongoing PCT training for DDA staff and provider agencies, both on site at DDS and at provider agencies to facilitate attendance. Once the new trainers are certified, they will assist with providing PCT training to providers, families, and people served by DDA. 3. How do you communicate with your target population and their families/caregivers/advocates/providers about community -based options? DDS communicates with the people we serve and other stakeh olders in a variety of ways; including hosting community forums, attending community events, e -mails, the DDS website, and use of social media. We have a stakeholder outreach list that includes more than 700 people, many of whom are grass -top leaders who w ill help spread the word. As an example, in the spring, we hosted a series of forums to educate the community and receive feedback on proposed changes to the HCBS IDD waiver. We held a community forum at the G ateway Pavillion in Anacostia, accessible to wh ere many of the families of the people we support live. We also presented at Project ACTION!, D.C.'s advocacy group for people with intellectual disabilities and the DC Coalition of Providers of Developmental Disabilities Services among other places. As a result, we received extensive comments on the proposed waiver amendments and made changes, accordingly, to reflect community input. For people who receive supports from DDA, PCT tools and skills are now an integral part of the ISP pre -planning proce ss. The tools identify the interests, preferences, preferred environments, support requirements, and provide important information for the development of ISP goals and programmatic activities that are meaningful to the person and lead to support delivery i n the most integrated, least restrictive setting appropriate to the person's needs. DDA also offers home and community -based services to persons who reside in ICF/IID settings during annual planning meetings and at any other time a person or their support team expresses an interest in home and community - based services. 4. What procedures or policies do you have in place to allow people with disabilities to assess the quality of the supports they receive? DDA has automated all of its performance metrics , and the data we collect is used to provide relevant in formation to assist consumers in choos ing service providers. The system may also be used to evaluate our staff, provider s, and District of Columbia Page 22 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Page 22 performance on a monthly basis for corrective action and quality improvemen t initiatives. Additionally, DDA posts the results of our Provider Certification Review process on our website, as well as provider reports cards, and listings of providers who are currently under sanctions. For District licensed facilities, the Departme nt of Health, Health Regulation and Licensing Administration also posts results of its surveys and investigations on its website. In FY 2014, DDA re -joined the National Core Indicators (NCI) project. NCI is a voluntary effort by public developmental disa bilities agencies to measure and track their own performance. The core indicators are standard measures used across states to assess the outcomes of services provided to individuals and families. Indicators address key areas of concern including employmen t, rights, service planning, community inclusion, choice, and health and safety. Results are drawn through interviews with people who receive services, and through responses from mailed surveys to families and guardians. The results are prepared by the Hu man Research Institute (HSRI) and the District will be able to compare its performance against forty (40) other participating states. RSA provides people or, as appropriate, their representatives with information and support services to assist the person in exercising informed choice. Informed choice begins when the person first contacts RSA to apply for Vocational Rehabilitation (\"VR\") services and continues throughout the rehabilitation process. An applicant or a person eligible to receive VR services has the right to exercise informed choice in decisions related to the provision of VR services including: the provision of assessment services, choices among the methods used to procure VR services, the selection of the employment outcome, the specific se rvices needed to achieve the employment outcome, and the entities that will provide the services to help them achieve their employment outcome. To ensure that the availability and scope of informed choice is consistent, in accordance with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 361.5 2 (c) (1), the information provided includes: Costs, accessibility, and duration of potential services; Consumer satisfaction with those services to the extent that information relating to consumer satisfaction is available; Qualifications of potential ser vice providers; Degree to which services are provided in integrated settings; and Outcomes achieved by people working with services providers, to the extent that such information is available. In FY 2013, DDS RSA added to the Office of Quality Assurance a nd Compliance two (2) new employees whose primary focus is to monitor the District of Columbia Page 23 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Page 23 quality and effectiveness of Supported Employment and Job Placement services provided by RSA's Community Rehabilitation Programs (\"CRPs\"). A robust monitoring tool was developed to better qualify each CRP's performance. Based on the data submitted to RSA by the CRPs, the Agency develops a Provider Profile showing each provider's performance for the covered time period. Data presented includes: Number of referrals per service area; Number of referred persons returned to the Agency; Number of people placed in employment; Number of employed people successfully employed for 90 days through DDS RSA ; Average number of days between referral and employment; Average number of hours worked pe r week; Average hourly pay; Currently, this information is provided to the VR supervisors and counselors for sharing with people receiving VR services. The agency is developing a CRP module through which this information will be available electronically. 5. What measures has your agency taken to address the needs of the following: a. Children who receive residential services from District agencies but live outside the District of Columbia. DDA works closely with the Child and Family Services Agency (\"CFSA\" ), the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (\"OSSE\"), the District of Columbia Public Schools (\"DCPS\"), the Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services (\"DYRS\") and Health Services for Children with Special Needs (\"HSCSN\") . Our mission is to identify children who have been placed in out of state residential facilities at least two to three years prior to aging out of such services so that DDA can ensure timely submission and completion of applications for eligibility determinations for adult ser vices. If eligible for adult services, DDA works with the sister agencies, families, guardians, and youth to prepare transitions back to the District for community -integrated supports as indicated based on person -centered planning. DDS is guided by statu te, policy, and best practice s; it ensures that transitioning youth receive services in Medicaid funded community -integrated services. See D.C. Official Code \u00a7 7-761.05(9). District of Columbia Page 24 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Page 24 RSA has worked with staff from DCPS, CFSA, and DBH to identify DC youth, receivin g secondary education outside of the District, to give them the opportunity to apply to RSA. RSA also provided training to all DBH supervisory staff on the VR process to facilitate effective referral of cases when a youth is transition back to the Distric t from an out -of-state facility. A presentation to provide an overview of the RSA process is planned for DBH staff. RSA has also invited representatives from DBH to provide input and feedback on the development of the RSA Youth in Transition Toolkit, whi ch describes the RSA process and expectations for when a youth applies for RSA services. b. Adults who receive residential service s from District agencies but reside outside the District of Columbia. Since 2007, DDA has returned 263 District residents t o District based community -integrated services from out -of-state residential placements. Currently, eleven (11) people remain out -of-state in Medicaid funded home and community -based settings as the DDA worked to honor their preference to remain with long -standing friends and service providers. Four (4) people continue to be served in locally funded settings as a result of agreements with guardians to permit their family members to remain where they have lived, in some cases, for over thirty years. Three (3) people receive specialized, locally funded treatment services out -of-state that are currently unavailable in the District. c. Individuals who are long -term homeless and seeking permanent housing. For people who are homeless and seeking permanent housin g, one of the most important issues is lack of steady and adequate income. RSA's focus is to help them obtain employment, but the reality is that the rehabilitation process can be long , and the need for housing/shelter is acute. Housing stability is a ch allenge for many of the people RSA serves because they have limited or no income. Currently, 1 ,874 RSA clients re ceive SSI or SSDI, while many of the other people served are already relying on family or friends for support. RSA Counselors provide inform ation at intake about housing and homele ss services, which includes information about available programs; and if District of Columbia Page 25 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Page 25 necessary, help connect people by making the call and providing transportation to get to the shelter. RSA also supports many of the related issues that homeless peo ple confront, including access to health care, deficits/gaps in education/literacy, and transportation issues. RSA provides assistance with these services, e.g., health services that are necessary to accomplish a vocational goal ca n be funded with VR funds. Transportation is provided as an adjunct service with any other service provided. RSA also works with OSSE and adult literacy programs to coordinate services. For people who are homeless a nd applying to DDA for supports, DDA us es local funds to provide emergency respite for short -term housing until eligibility can be determined. Once determined, DDA uses person -centered planning to identify community -based residential and other supports that will meet the person's assessed need s. If the person is found ineligible, DDA will connect him or her with appropriate community resources. Occasionally, a person who already receives supports from DDA may become homeless due to illness, hospitalization, or death of his or her primary supp ort person in the home, or because there is an allegation of abuse or neglect by the person's caregiver. In those instances, DDS also uses local or Medicaid funds to provide emergency respite and then uses person -centered planning for long term supports. d. Individuals who are soon to be released from jail/juvenile detention facilities. DDA supports people eligible for services who are pending release with a full range of housing and supportive services based on person -centered planning. e. Individuals who are receiving services, but still have significant unmet needs which put them at risk of placement in non -community -based settings. DDA currently does not experience challenges with meeting unmet needs that could place a person at risk of placement in non -community settings except as noted above. In cases where specialized service s are not available, it seeks to recruit specialized providers from across the country to develop services in the District to avoid out -of-state placements. District of Columbia Page 26 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Page 26 f. Individuals who do no t receive services but are known to have unmet needs that put them at risk for placement in non -community -based settings. DDS recently applied for a grant for \"Transforming State Long Term Services and Supports (\"LTSS\") Access Program and Functions into a No Wrong Door System for All Populations and All Payers. The proposal development process brought together over 20 partners who are committed to working together to create more streamlined and person -centered approaches for people with disabilities and o thers in need of LTSS. The proposal will also make it easier for people of all ages, disabilities and income levels to learn about and access the services and supports they need. If awarded, this grant will help facilitate access to community -based servi ces and person -centered planning for people with unmet needs who are at risk for placement in non - community based services. g. Individuals not receiving formalized services but who live with a family member unable to support them effectively. In May 201 3, DDA, in partnership with the Developmental Disabilities Council (\"DD Council\"), was awarded the \" National Community of Practice: Supporting Families Throughout the Lifespan\" grant. This grant is funded by the Administration on Intellectual and Developm ental Disabilities (\"AIDD\") and is managed by a partnership between the National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services (\"NASDDDS\"), University of Missouri Kansas City Institute for Human Development (\"UMKC -IHD\"), Human Servi ces Research Institute (\"HSRI\"), and the National Association of Councils on Developmental Disabilities (\"NACDD\"). The National Community of Practice: Supporting Families Throughout the Lifespan grant provides funding and technical support to develop sy stems of support for families throughout the lifespan of their family member with an intellectual or developmental disability. \"The overall goal of supporting families, with all of their complexity, strengths, and unique abilities is so they can best supp ort, nurture, love, and facilitate opportunities for the achievement of self -determination, interdependence, productivity, integration, and inclusion in all facets of community life for their family members\" \u2014 Building a National Agenda for Supports to Famil ies with Member with I/DD, 2011. District of Columbia Page 27 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Community For All\" Page 27 Throug h this five (5) year grant, DDA, in collaboration with the DD Council, Project ACTION!, the Quality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities, and the Georgetown Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities, has convened a team of family members, people with IDD, and other government and community partners, to develop and implement an action plan that ultimately will shape policies and programs that support families. Through our work with the State Team, we have strengthened two -way communications with people with developmental disabilities and their families throughout the lifespan and have begun to identify and address gaps. As an example, a consistent message from families has been about the need for peer -supp ort across disabilities and across the lifespan. The DC Core Team has been working closely with Health Services for Children with Special Needs and the National Parent to Parent to plan the launch of a DC Parent to Parent chapter. We have also identifie d many parent leaders in the community who participate in the Community of Practice and will share information back and forth within the community. We have seen increased participation by family members at community meetings. Interagency Collaboration 6. Explain specifically how your agency works with other participating agencies, District residents, and community stakeholders. Please identify the agency/agencies (Government and Community -based) and consider the following: a. Recommend community services and supports that allow an individual to select services and supports designed for their specific needs. DDA has extensive and established policies, procedures, and practices that ensure people who apply for services are connected to government and community services. For persons who apply but are found ineligible for services, the DDA intake service coordinator provides information and referral resources based on the information and assessment materials gathered in the eligibility determination process to th e person and their allies. These resources include , but are not limited to: Department of Human Services, Economic Security Administration (\"DHS/ESA\") for Medicaid, Temporary Aid to Needy Families (\"TANF\"), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (\"SN AP\") and other social service benefits; RSA District of Columbia Page 28 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Page 28 Office on Aging, Aging and Disabilities Resource Center (\"DCOA/ADRC\"); Department of Behavioral Health ( DBH ); Department of Health Care Finance (\"DHCF\") for the Elder ly and Person with Physical Disabilities (\" EPD\") waiver; Housing Authority (\"DCHA\"); Mayors Liaison Services Center ; Center for Independent Living (\"DCCIL\"); University Legal Services; The Quality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities; Mary's Center; Consumer Action Network; Health Services for Children with Special Needs (\"HSCSN\"); Rachel's Women's Center; Bread for the City; Lifeline Partnership; and Columbia Heights/Shaw Family Support Collaborative: Parenting Program. . For persons found eligible, DDA completes numerous assessm ents and subsequently person -centered planning with the person and their support team. Based on identified needs , the person is provided with an extensive list of formal, informal, government and community services and supports that can meet each need. Fo r paid services, DDA has strict policies and procedures that govern choice of providers from an approved list of qualified providers under the Medicaid programs. b. Develop effective and timely transition plans for individuals who are placed in non -communit y-based settings. DDA participates in the MFP program and offers home and community - based services to persons who reside in ICF/IID settings during annual planning meetings and at any other time a person or their allies request home and community -based se rvices. DDA works collaboratively with OSSE, DCPS, CFSA, and DBH to identify people with intellectual disabilities who are placed in non -community -based settings and are or may be seeking transition to community -based services and supports. Once identifi ed, DDA works with the person and sister agencies to District of Columbia Page 29 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Community For All\" Page 29 complete eligibility determinations, assessments, person -centered planning, and a transition plan to community services. DDA is also notified of all nursing home placements within the District for persons who are suspected to have an intellectual or developmental disability through the Preadmission Screening and Resident Review (\"PASRR\") process. Upon such notice, DDA conducts a PASRR evaluation and (a) determines if such placement is appropriate, (b) determines if supportive services are required to assist the person to assess the community or receive habilitative supports while in the nursing home, and/or (c) prepare s to work on transitioning the person from the nursing home to community supports, if not already known to DDA. Lastly, DDA receives referrals from the ADRC and utilizes its i ntake service coordination team to assist eligible persons for DDA services to transition from nursing homes to community services. c. Conduct outreach on your services or other participating agencies' services specifically geared toward your service population. DDA regularly conducts outreach on services and supports available for people with intellectual disabilities. Outreach venues include , but are not limited to: RSA HSCSN, including at the June Fair and Family and Community Health Expo DC City Wide Transition Fair Mayors Disability Awareness Expo Public and charter school fairs OSSE events such as the Transition Professional Development Series and the OSSE CIRCLE S Transition meeting DC Superior Court, Pretrial Services, Drug Court Seeking Equality Empowerment and Community (\"SEEC\")/ Smithsonian Project SEARCH Public Defender Service Re -entry Summit RSA conducts outreach through a number of means: RSA has estab lished Memoranda of Agreement with a number of District agencies and community based non -profit social services and health providers. Through these agreements, RSA currently accepts District of Columbia Page 30 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Community For All\" Page 30 referrals, conducts intakes, and sees clients at a variety of sites acros s the District. These include: o 4 DOES sites o 3 Unity Clinics o Project Empowerment o N Street Village, Inc. o Mayor's Liaison Office DC Superior Court o Ethiopian Community Center o Office of Asian Affairs o Salvation Army (Harbor Lights Treatment Program) o Aging and Disability Services o GW Acute Rehabilitation o Washington Literacy Center o Independent Living Services (Urban League) o Columbia Lighthouse for the Blind o Providence Hospital o S.O.M.E. Veterans o Langston Lane Apartments o Community of Hope o S.O.M.E o Harvest House o New Endeavor's for Women o Central Union Mission. VR counselors from RSA's transition unit visit all District Public High Schools, all Public Charter Schools, the Model Secondary School (Gallaudet University) and all non -public schools that serve transition -aged District youth. The counselors conduct intakes and provide information about services to students, their families, and school staff. RSA developed a number of materials to improve outreach. A printed application for services is widely available in the community. The application is also available on the agency's website. In addition, as indicated above, the agency worked with SchoolTalk, Inc., OSSE, DCPS, DBH, and The Arc to develop a Transition Tool Kit for youth and their families. Lastly, the admi nistration developed an orientation video regar ding VR services that is shown at intake and is available on the agency's website. District of Columbia Page 31 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Page 31 The outreach efforts over the past year have been successful. RSA has seen continued growth in the number of new referrals . There was an increase from 2,380 referrals in FY 2012 to 3,141 in FY 2013. This increase continued in FY 2014. Addressing Barriers 7. How does your agency address any or all of the following barriers to successful provision of community -based supports for individuals with disabilities? Note: address only those populations applicable to your agency's mission and vision. a. Lack of comprehensive information on the supports and services available. As part of the 2014 -2016 State Plan for Independent Living, the DCCIL plans to create a How -to Information Guide for distribution to the community that will promote understanding of local housing requirements for persons with significant disabilities. The State Independent Living Council (\"DCSILC\") will advise the RSA and DCCIL in these efforts through community outreach and advocacy, with the end goal of ensuring that the guide bridges the knowledge gaps consumers have on the array of Independent Living services and supports available to them. The DCSILC will also advocate and provide testimony in reference to improved housing opportunities for people with disabilities before the Mayor and DC Council. b. Impacts of transitioning to life in the community: discrimination, fear, and stigma. DDS works closely with its s ervice provider community to ensure community and neighborhood relations are developed and maintained to help mitigate stigma and negative perceptions among community members, especially as it pertains to NIMBY issues. DDS also presents at community meeti ngs, ANC meetings, and hiring events , for example , to advance education about the rights and contributions of people with disabilities. DDS supports fully community -integrated services and through those efforts has significantly increased the opportunitie s of persons with disabilities to receive services in settings where people without disabilities live, work, and play , thus advancing the overall awareness and enrichment of our community at -large. DDS is now District of Columbia Page 32 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Page 32 working on other media campaigns that will con tinue to educate our community to embrace and value all members of our city. c. Unavailability of support services to assist with daily life for individuals with severe disabilities, such as education, transportation, and employment. The most significant d eficit in the District's services and support for people with disabilities is for persons with developmental disabilities and brain injury who are not eligible for services fro m DDA or the EPD waiver program. These are constituents in the program operated by DHCF. Despite its name, DDA is only authorized to serve people with intellectual disabilities, narrowly defined as persons with an IQ of 70 or below and deficits in at least two areas of adaptive functioning such as communication, self -care, home liv ing, social skills, community use, self - direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure, and work, established prior to the age of 18 years of age.ii Due to the nature of developmental disabilit ies and brain injuries, these persons require supp orts and may be at significant risk for institutionalization but are not eligible for any services in the District. The District remains one of two jurisdictions in the nation to only provide services to people with ID and not DD. DDS has supported exp anding its statute to serve people with DD within available appropriations and previously met opposition by the advocacy community as it may lead to waiting lists for services where none existed in the past. Despite this, it is imperative that the Distric t again seek to expand its eligibility under DDA to serve this population to avoid unnecessary institutionalization of persons with DD. A second under -served population is persons who experience brain trauma and the injury results in significant cognitive impairments. Again, those persons are not eligible for services from DDA if the i njury occurred after age 18. Additionally, if they are not physically disabled, they are not eligible for services under the EPD program. The number of persons who experie nce brain injury is growing via service related injuries, vehicle accidents, and gun violence. As a result , this is another popu lation that often must rely on nursing facilities for support. District of Columbia Page 33 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Page 33 Another significant barrier to community living is the absence of the Medicaid Buy -in Program for Working People with Disabilities (\"MBI - WPD\") in the District. The MBI -WPD is a program that allows individuals with disabilities to work and get or keep Medicaid. Many persons with significant disabilities are unable to obtain employer -funded private health insurance that provides coverage comparable to Medicaid. The fear of losing Medicaid and/or Medicare is one of the greatest barriers keeping individuals with disabilities from maximizing their employment, earnings potential, and independence. For many Social Security Disability Insurance (\"SSDI\") and Supplemental Security Income (\"SSI\") beneficiaries, the risk of losing health care through work activity can be a greater work disincentive than the risk of losing cash ben efits through work activity. For people who receive supports from DDA, the DDS HRAC has identified ventilator -use as a systemic barrier to community based living, albeit one that affects a small number of people DDA supports . The HRAC made a recommendat ion to the DDS Deputy Director for DDA to research barriers and propose solutions. DDS has begun discussions on this issue with DHCF and the Department of Health (\"DOH\"). Finally, the RSA Vocational Rehabilitation (\"VR\") program is able to provide time limited supports to help people with significant disabilities move to employment. When people need extended supports to maintain employment, RSA attempts to develop a plan including natural supports through its VR program. Long term employment supports are currently available for people with intellectual disabilities through the Home and Community Based Services waiver for People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (\"HCBS IDD\") waiver. However, long term supports are more difficult to ident ify for people with physical or other disabilities, and the EPD waiver currently lacks long -term employment supports in its benefit package. Ticket to Work does provide some job retention support, but for a person who needs ongoing supported employment, t his level of support is not adequate. d. Insufficient numbers of compensated, trained employees to work with the population of people with disabilities . Currently , DDS is not experiencing significant problems with the ability to retain trained employees to work with the population of people with District of Columbia Page 34 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Page 34 disabilities. Our current vacancy rate in key service positions working with individuals with intellectual disabilities (service coordination) is approximately 7%, which is a reasonable and expected rate allowing fo r normal turnover. The current vacancy rate for VR specialists is 13% and this is a bit higher than ideal, but during the recent year it has been very low and the 13% is not a long term rate. DDS keeps the vacancy rates low through active, targeted recru iting. The ability of the disability service providers to recruit and retain trained individuals is a bit more of a concern particularly in regards to clinical staffing. DDS has taken steps to assist the providers in their staffing by retaining professio nal services to develop a series of advertisements to recruit clinical professionals into the disability field in the District of Columbia. At this time , we are waiting for service provider input prior to launching the advertising campaign. Additionally, working collaboratively with DHCF, DDS is submitting an amendment to the HCBS IDD waiver that would raise the rates for a number of clinical services in an effort to increase provider capacity in this critical area. e. Post -discharge into community -based living with subsequent assessment that transition is not meeting the needs of the individual. DDA provides ongoing service coordination for people with intellectual disabilities who transition into community -based services t hrough the HCBS IDD waiver. T hrough our policy and procedure, there are required post-transition visits by a service coordinator to ensure the transition has gone smoothly. The service coordinator will assess how the person is doing in both their new residential and day/ vocational se tting and add additional supports or make changes in supports as needed, based upon the person's assessed needs and preferences. DDA has also retained a nurse via its quality assurance project contract with the Georgetown University Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities (\"UCEDD\") whose sole function is to monitor the course of care a person receives while hospitalized or in a nursing home . The nurse then conducts follow - up with the community home setting post -discharge to ensure that all health-related discharge orders are being followed. As part of the State Plan for Independent Living, the DCSILC has taken on the charge of advocating for city -wide implementation and education to support and campaign to improve transition planning for people who are District of Columbia Page 35 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Page 35 on track for discharge from institutional or other restrict ive settings . The DCSILC will monitor such planning to ensure that person -centered thinking is the focus of all such planning. The DCSILC will also advise RSA, other District government, and community agencies to achieve an Independent Living services and supports system that ensures planning for independence across the lifespan. Additionally, the DCCIL provides advocacy and peer support services to people with disabilities. District of Columbia Page 36 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For Healthcare Finance (DHCF) FY '15 Olmstead Planning Outline Setting Priorities 1. When does your agency consider an individual to be \"institutionalized\" under the auspices of the Olmstead mandate? Department of Healthcare Finance (DHCF) defines \"institutionalized as 91 days or more. 2. What policies/procedures does your Agency utilize for identifying individuals ready and invested for transition into the community? DHCF works in partnership with the DC Office on Aging/Aging & Disability Resource C enter (DCOA/ADRC) and DDS/DDA Department on Disability Services/Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDS/DDA) to identify individuals ready for and invested in transition. This is consistent with the agency's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service s approved Money Follows the Person (MFP) Rebalancing Demonstration Operational Protocol and Memoranda of Understanding between DHCF and DCOA/ADRC on MFP outreach to nursing facilities and operating as the intake and referral entity for the Elderly and Phy sical Disabilities (EPD) Home and Community -Based Services Waiver. 3. How do you communicate with your target population and their families/caregivers/advocates/providers about community -based options? Through its MFP Rebalancing Demonstration, DHCF conduc ts outreach to all District nursing facilities on a monthly basis in collaboration with the DCOA/ADRC. A monthly stakeholder meeting is convened by MFP as well. During FY 2015 , the responsibility for convening the stakeholder meeting will be transitioned t o DCOA/ADRC, the agency assuming the responsibility for MFP operations for DC residents transitioning from nursing facilities. The Demonstration also offers individualized consultation in service planning meetings about community -based options for resident s of Intermediate Care Facilities for people with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (ICFs/IDD) at the request of residents and/or DDA service coordinators. District of Columbia Page 37 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Community For All\" Page 37 DHCF hosts monthly provider meetings for its EPD Waiver and Medicaid State Plan provider s of home and community -based services. DHCF's web site also features participant handbooks that include home and community -based options for its Medicaid Fee -for-Service beneficiaries and Elderly and Physical Disabilities Waiver Program participants. 4. What procedures or policies do you have in place to allow people with disabilities to assess the quality of the supports they receive? The MFP Rebalancing Demonstration, through its operating agencies, DCOA/ADRC and DDS/DDA, administers a Quality of Lif e survey immediately before transition from a long term care facility and at 11 and 24 months after discharge from the long term care facility to home and community -based services. DHCF solicits feedback from people with disabilities during planning and design for home and community -based services. This process provides people with disabilities the opportunity to comment on the quality of services. 5. What measures has your agency taken to address the needs of the following: a. Children who receive reside ntial services from District agencies but who live outside the District of Columbia. b. Adults who recei ve residential services from District agencies but who reside outside the District of Columbia . Through its MFP Rebalancing Demonstration, DHCF supports transition coordination for Medicaid beneficiaries who are placed in out -of-state nursing facilities and ICFs/IDDs. These referrals come directly or through the Demonstration's operating agencies (DCOA/ADRC, DDS/DDA). c. Individuals who are long -term homeles s and seeking permanent housing . Through its MFP Rebalancing Demonstration, when housing financing is available (either through Housing Choice Voucher or other housing subsidies through the DC Housing Authority), DHCF supports transition coordination for District of Columbia Page 38 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Page 38 Medicaid beneficiaries who are long -term homeless and currently residing in a nursing facility, and remain there in large part because they do not have a home to return to. d. Individuals who are soon to be released from jail/juvenile detention facilities. e. Individuals who are receiving services, but who still have significant unmet needs which put them at risk of placement in non -community - based settings. f. Individuals who do not receive services but are known to have unmet needs that put them at risk for pl acement in non -community -based settings. g. Individuals not receiving formalized services but who live with a family member unable to support them effectively. Through its MFP Rebalancing Demonstration, DHCF supports individualized consultation for these f amilies when referred by DDS/DDA. Interagency Collaboration 6. Explain specifically how your agency works with other participating agencies, District residents, and community stakeholders. Please identify the agency/agencies (Government and Community -based) and consider the following: a. Recommend community services and supports that allow an individual to select services and supports designed for their specific needs. See responses above regarding the MFP Rebalancing Demonstration. In addition, when it is ide ntified that a participant has a serious and persistent mental illness, the compilation of documentation required for DBH services is initiated by MFP Transition Coordinators (TCs), and review and approval, if appropriate, is facilitated by the TCs. DHCF has a Memorandum of Agreement with DCOA/ADRC and DBH that outlines roles and responsibilities specifically for the purpose of transitioning nursing facility residents. District of Columbia Page 39 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 \u2014One Community For All\" Page 39 b. Develop effective and timely transition plans for individuals who are placed in non -community -based settings. See responses above for the MFP Rebalancing Demonstration. DHCF has a Memorandum of Agreement with DCOA/ADRC and DBH that outlines roles and responsibilities specifically f or the purpose of transitioning nursing facility residents. c. Conduct outreach on your services or other participating agencies' services specifically geared toward your service population. DCOA/ADRC, Department of Behavioral Health (DBH), DDS/DDA See res ponses above for the MFP Rebalancing Demonstration. DHCF has a Memorandum of Agreement with DCOA/ADRC and DBH that outlines roles and responsibilities specifically for the purpose of transitioning nursing facility residents. Addressing Barriers 7. How does y our agency address any or all of the following barriers to successful provision of community -based supports for individuals with disabilities? Note: address only those populations applicable to your agency's mission and vision. a. Lack of comprehensive info rmation on the supports and services available. DCHF has d evelop ed accessible, easy -to-read handbooks on Medicaid home and community -based services as noted above , and they are posted on DHCF's Web site. Monthly face -to-face outreach and meetings as not ed above. b. Impacts of transitioning to life in the community: discrimination, fear, and stigma. Through the MFP Rebalancing Demonstration, in partnership with the DCOA/ADRC, DHCF deliver s intensive case management services during the first year after disc harge from a nursing facility. District of Columbia Page 40 of 42 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Community For All\" Page 40 DHCF anticipates that t he operationalization of the Peer Counseling MFP Demonstration service through DC Medicaid in FY15 should also help to mitigate these impacts. c. Unavailability of support services to assist with daily l ife for individuals with severe disabilities, such as education, transportation, and employment. MFP Project Team members continue to actively participate in several systems change initiatives aimed at increasing community integration for people with disab ilities. Among these are the Association of People Supporting EmploymentFirst (APSE) board and membership meetings, the EmploymentFirst Leadership meeting, and the EmploymentFirst Community of Practice meeting. d. Insufficient numbers of compensated, trained employees to work with the population of people with disabilities. Through its MFP Rebalancing Demonstration, DHCF is discussing partnership with DDS/DDA on person -centered thinking training for day program provider staff that focuses on community integrat ion for FY 2015 . DHCF rate setting, and mandatory training requirements for long term care home and community -based service providers addresses this factor on a large scale. e. Post -discharge into community -based living with subsequent assessment that trans ition is not meeting the needs of the individual. Through the MFP Rebalancing Demonstration, in partnership with the DCOA/ADRC, the delivery of intensive case management services during the first year after discharge from a nursing facility. These case ma nagers often identify and work to resolve care coordination issues when the transition is not meeting the needs of the individual. i \"District of Columbia Primary Service Agency Priorities,\" DC \u2014One Community for All pp. 8 -9 (April 2012).

Children and Adolescents Behavioral Health Services Narrative Question: MHBG funds are intended to support programs and activities for children with SED, and SABG funds are available for prevention , treatment, and recovery services for youth and young adults. Each year, an estimated 20 percent of children in the U.S. have a diagnosable m ental health condition and one in 10 suffers from a serious mental disorder that contributes to substantial impairment in their functionin g at home, at school, or in the community.90 Most mental health disorders have their roots in childhood, with about 50 percent of affected adults manifesting such disorders by age 14, and 75 percent by age 24.91 For youth between the ages of 10 and 24, suicide is the third leading cause of death.92 It is also important to note that 11 percent of high school students have a diagnosable substance use disorder involving nico tine, alcohol, or illicit drugs, and nine out of 10 adults who meet clinical criteria for a substance use disorder started smoking, drinking, o r using illicit drugs before the age of 18. Of people who started using before the age of 18, one in four will develop an addiction compared to one in twenty -five who started using substances after age 21.93 Mental and substance use disorders in children and adolescents are complex, typically involving multiple challenges. These children and youth are frequently involved in more than one specialized system, including mental h ealth, substance abuse, primary health, education, childcare, child welfare, or juvenile justice. This multi -system involvement often results in fragmented and inadequate care, leaving families overwhelmed and children's needs unmet. For youth and young adults who are transitioning in to adult responsibilities, negotiating between the child - and adult -serving systems becomes even harder. To address the need for additional coordination, SAMHSA is encouraging states to designate a liaison for children to assist schools in assuring identified child ren are connected with available mental health and/or substance abuse screening, treatment and recovery support services. Since 1993, SAMHSA has funded the Children's Mental Health Initiative (CMHI) to build the system of care approach in states a nd communities around the country. This has been an ongoing program with more than 160 grants awarded to states and communities, and every s tate has received at least one CMHI grant. In 2011, SAMHSA awarded System of Care Expansion grants to 24 states to bring this approach to scale in states. In terms of adolescent substance abuse, in 2007, SAMHSA awarded State Substance Abuse Coordinator grants to 16 states to begin to build a state infrastructure for substance abuse treatment and recovery -oriented systems of care for youth with substance use disorders. This work has continued with a focus on financing and workforce development to support a recovery -oriented system of care that incorporates established evidence -based treatment for youth with substance use disorders. For the pa st 25 years, the system of care approach has been the major framework for improving delivery systems, services, and outcomes for children, youth, and young adults with mental and/or substance use disorders and co -occurring disorders and their families. This approach is comprised of a spectrum of effective, community -based services and supports that are organized into a coordinated network. This approach helps build meaningful partnerships across systems and addresses cultural and linguistic needs while improving the child's, y outh's and young adult's functioning in their home, school, and community. The system of care approach provides individualized services, is fa mily driven and youth guided, and builds on the strengths of the child, youth or young adult and their family and promotes recovery and resil ience. Services are delivered in the least restrictive environment possible, and using evidence -based practices while providing effective cross -system collaboration, including integrated management of service delivery and costs.94 According to data from the National Evaluation of the Children's Mental Health Initiative (2011), systems of care95: reach many children and youth typically underserved by the mental health system; improve emotional and behavioral outcomes for children and youth; enhance family outcomes, such as decreased caregiver stress; decrease suicidal ideation and gestures; expand the availability of effective supports and services; and save money by reducing costs in high cost services such as residential settings, inpatient hospitals, and juvenile justice se ttings. SAMHSA expects that states will build on the well -documented, effective system of care approach to serving children and youth with serious behavioral health needs. Given the multi - system involvement of these children and youth, the system of care approach provides the infrastructure to improve care coordination and outcomes, manage costs, and better invest resources. The array of services an d supports in the system of care approach includes non -residential services, like wraparound service planning, intensive care management, outpatient therapy, intensive home -based services, substance abuse intensive outpatient services, continuing care, and mobile crisis response; supportive servic es, like peer youth support, family peer support, respite services, mental health consultation, and supported education and emplo yment; and residential services, like therapeutic foster care, crisis stabilization services, and inpatient medical detoxification. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state's system: How will the state establish and monitor a system of care approach to support the recovery and resilience of children and you th with serious mental and substance use disorders?1.

Pregnant Women and Women with Dependent Children Narrative Question: Substance -abusing pregnant women have always been the number one priority population in the SAMHSA block grant (Title XIX, Part B, Subpart II, Sec.1922 (c)) . A formula based on the FY 1993 and FY 1994 block grants was established to increase the availability of treatment services designed for pregnant women and women with dependent children. The purpose of establishing a \"set -aside\" was to ensure the availability of comprehensive, substance use disorder treatment, and prevention and recovery support services for pregnant an d postpartum women and their dependent children. This population continues to be a priority, given the importance of prenatal care and sub stance abuse treatment for pregnant, substance using women, and the importance of early development in children. For families involved in the child welfare system, successful participation in treatment for substance use disorders is the best predictor for children remaining with t heir mothers. Women with dependent children are also named as a priority for specialized treatment (as opposed to treatment as usual) in the SABG regulations. MOE provisions require that the state expend no less than an amount equal to that spent by the state in a base fiscal year for tr eatment services designed for pregnant women and women with dependent children. For guidance on components of quality substance abuse treatment services for women, States and Territories can refer to the f ollowing documents, which can be accessed through the SAMHSA website at http://www.samhsa.gov/women -children -families: Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) 51, Substance Abuse Treatment; Addressing the Specific Needs of Women; Guidance to States; Treatme nt Standards for Women with Substance Use Disorders; Family -Centered Treatment for Women with Substance Abuse Disorders: History, Key Elements and Challenges. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state's system: The implementing regulation requires the availability of treatment and admission preference for pregnant women be made known and that pregnant women are prioritized for admission to treatment. Please discuss the strategies your state uses to accomplish t his.1. Discuss how the state currently ensures that pregnant women are admitted to treatment within 48 hours.2. Discuss how the state currently ensures that interim services are provided to pregnant women in the event that a treatment fa cility has insufficient capacity to provide treatment services.3. Discuss who within your state is responsible for monitoring the requirements in 1 -3. 4. How many programs serve pregnant women and their infants?

Suicide Prevention The District of Columbia suicide data from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Fatal Injury Reports (1999 -2013) shows that the District is ranked 51 in the nation for suicide deaths with a total of 38 deaths at a rate of 5.9 deaths per 100,000. There is no current suicide plan. A plan was developed as part of a SAMHSA youth suicide grant that ended in FY 2013. A website was developed (I AM THE DIFFERENCE) along with marketing materials. While there is no current suicide preve ntion plan, DBH implements a number of suicide prevention related activities. DBH provides training for the District Metropolitan Police Department at the Policy Academy. The Crisis Intervention Officer (CIO) training includes SafeTalk (suicide alertness) and is provided 5 times a year. Also, all new recruit training includes SafeTalk and is provided between 7-10 times a year. The DBH Training Institute held six (6) SafeTalk trainings in calendar year 2014 with 103 trainees. In calendar year 2015 there wer e 3 classes with 65 trainees. The DBH Access HelpLine is a certified suicide prevention Lifeline. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) workers have been trained in SafeTalk. Also, the WMATA Suicide Line is housed in the DBH Access Hel pLine.

Support of State Partners Narrative Question: The success of a state 's MHBG and SABG programs will rely heavily on the strategic partnership that SMHAs and SSAs have or will develop with other health, social services, and education providers, as well as other state, local, and tribal governmental entities. Examples of partnerships may include: The SMA agreeing to consult with the SMHA or the SSA in the development and/or oversight of health homes for individuals with chronic health conditions or consultation on the benefits available to any Medicaid populations; The state justice system authorities working with the state, local, and tribal judicial systems to develop policies and progr ams that address the needs of individuals with mental and substance use disorders who come in contact with the criminal and juvenile j ustice systems, promote strategies for appropriate diversion and alternatives to incarceration, provide screening and treatment, and implement transition services for those individuals reentering the community, including efforts focused on enrollment; The state education agency examining current regulations, policies, programs, and key data -points in local and tribal school districts to ensure that children are safe, supported in their social/emotional development, exposed to initiatives that target risk and p rotective actors for mental and substance use disorders, and, for those youth with or at -risk of emotional behavioral and substance use disorders, to ensure that they have the services and supports needed to succeed in school and improve their graduation rates and reduce out-of- district placements; The state child welfare/human services department, in response to state child and family services reviews, working with local and tribal child welfare agencies to address the trauma and mental and substance use disorders in children, youth, and family members th at often put children and youth at -risk for maltreatment and subsequent out -of-home placement and involvement with the foster care system, including specific service issues, such as the appropriate use of psychotropic medication for children and youth involved in child welfare; The state public housing agencies which can be critical for the implementation of Olmstead; The state public health authority that provides epidemiology data and/or provides or leads prevention services and activities ; and The state 's office of emergency management/homeland security and other partners actively collaborate with the SMHA/SSA in planning for emergencies that may result in behavioral health needs and/or impact persons with behavioral health conditions a nd their families and caregivers, providers of behavioral health services, and the state 's ability to provide behavioral health services to meet all phases of an emergency (mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery) and including appropriate engagement of volunteers w ith expertise and interest in behavioral health. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state 's system: Identify any existing partners and describe how the partners will support the state in implementing the priorities identified in the planning process.1.

State Behavioral Health Planning/Advisory Council and Input on the Mental Health/Substance Abuse Block Grant Application Narrative Question: Each state is required to establish and maintain a state Mental Health Planning/Advisory Council for adults with SMI or child ren with SED. To meet the needs of states that are integrating mental health and substance abuse agencies, SAMHSA is recommending that states expand their Mental Health Advisory Council to include substance abuse, referred to here as a Behavioral Health Advisory/Planning Council (BHPC). SAMHSA encourages states to expand their required Council's comprehensive approach by designing and implementing regularly sc heduled collaborations with an existing substance abuse prevention and treatment advisory council to ensure that the council reviews issues and services for persons with, or at risk for, substance abuse and substance use disorders. To assist with implementing a BHPC, SAMHSA has created Best Practices for State Behavioral Health Planning Councils: The Road to Planning Council Integration.97 Additionally, Title XIX, Subpart III, section 1941 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 300x -51) applicable to the SABG and the MHBG, requires that, as a condition of the funding agreement for the grant, states will provide an opportunity for the public to comment on the state b lock grant plan. States should make the plan public in such a manner as to facilitate comment from any person (including federal, tribal, or o ther public agencies) both during the development of the plan (including any revisions) and after the submission of the plan to SAMHSA. For SABG only - describe the steps the state took to make the public aware of the plan and allow for public comment. For MHBG and integrated BHPC; States must include documentation that they shared their application and implementation report with the Planning Council; please also describe the steps the state took to make the public aware of the plan and allow for public com ment. SAMHSA requests that any recommendations for modifications to the application or comments to the implementation report that w ere received from the Planning Council be submitted to SAMHSA, regardless of whether the state has accepted the recommendations. The documentation, preferably a letter signed by the Chair of the Planning Council, should state that the Planning Council review ed the application and implementation report and should be transmitted as attachments by the state. Please consider the following items as a guide when preparing the description of the state's system: How was the Council actively involved in the state plan? Attach supporting documentation (e.g., meeting minutes, letters of s upport, etc.).1. What mechanism does the state use to plan and implement substance abuse services?2. Has the Council successfully integrated substance abuse prevention and treatment or co -occurring disorder issues, concerns, and activities into its work?3. Is the membership representative of the service area population (e.g., ethnic, cultural, linguistic, rural, suburban, urban, older adults, families of young children)?4. Please describe the duties and responsibilities of the Council, including how it gathers meaningful input from people in reco very, families and other important stakeholders, and how it has advocated for individuals with SMI or SED.5. Additionally, please complete the Behavioral Health Advisory Council Members and Behavioral Health Advisory Council Compositi on by Member Type forms.98 97http://beta.samhsa.gov/grants/block -grants/resources 98There are strict state Council membership guidelines. States must demonstrate: (1) the involvement of people in recovery and their family members; (2) the ratio of parents of children with SED to other Council members is sufficient to provide adequate representation of that constituency in delibe rations on the Council; and (3) no less than 50 percent of the members of the Council are individuals who are not state employees or providers of mental health services. Please use the box below to indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section: Technical assistance is needed to fulfill the mandate to monitor, review, and evaluate at least once each year the allocation and adequacy of mental health and substance use disorder services within the District, and use the findings to review the Block Grant Plans and make recommendations. This includes determining the types of data that are relevant to behavioral health services and data interpr etation. Technical assistance is also needed to support the overall Goals of the DBH Behavioral Health Council: 1. Ensure that individuals in need of mental health and/or substance use disorder services have access to services; 2. Ensure that consumer and family directed services and supports for the prevention and treatment of mental and substance use d isorders maintains a focus on recovery and resilience; 3. Advocate for District residents with mental and substance use disorders and serious emotional disturbance; 4. Support the integration of mental and substance use disorder prevention, treatment and recovery services and supports into ov erall health services; 5.

They included: 1) receiving general TA provided to state planning councils that included an on -site TA mee ting with the existing planning council (FY 2012 -2013 cycle); 2) participating in the state planning council intensive TA National Learning Community that involved monthly conference calls and individual state calls, and an on -site TA meeting with the ment al health advisory councils, consumers/clients, family members, advocates, mental health and substance use disorder staff and providers (FY 2013 -2014 cycle); and 3) participating in the Leadership Academy and on -site TA (FY 2014 -2015 cycle) for the newly c reated Behavioral Health Council. On August 19, 2015 the DBH Behavioral Health Council orientation meeting was held. In addition to the council members, the new DBH Acting Director, Dr. Tanya A. Royster, M.D., and the DBH grant program staff participated in the meeting. The co -facilitators were Phillip Lubitz, M.S.W. and Angela Halvorson, M.P., M.S. The presentations generated thoughtful questions, comments and discussion. DBH Behavioral Health Council Comments The DBH Behavioral Health Council review ed and provided comment s about the District of Columbia Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan. To facilitate their review, they were given a Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan Review Comment Guide . The comments below are organized by the document review sections. A. Overview of Adult Service System 1. Most important adult service system strengths: Accessibility/availability of mental health services. Health Homes Initiative , Evidence based practices , Supported Housing services. Having the abil ity to select providers of choice. Partnering with providers to develop recovery oriented treatment plans. Education, Employment, Housing . Evidence Based Practice/ACT. Mental Health Services Division -particularly multicultural services. 2. Most important unmet service needs or critical gaps in the adult service system: Services for people with mental health issues and intellectual/developmental disabilities . Being re -traumatized by agencies that lack compassion, integrity and dignity for the individual 's overall well -being. Lacking cultural compe tency to the population served (Missing the margin) . Not enough peer lead groups/ organizations. District of Columbia Page 3 of 6 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 185 of 194 Therapy. Access to and more support of recovery oriented, integrated supported employment and vocational/educational opportunities . More (integrated) wheelchair/disability accessible housing within the entire continuum of supported housing services. B. Overview of Child and Youth Service System 1. Most important child and youth service system strengths: Comprehensive service s. Parent Infant Early Childhood Enhancement (PIECE) Program has dedicated well trained (in several evidence -based practices) staff (intact team for several years) providing early intervention services to families of children under the age of 6. The Children Psychiatric Practice Group (PPG) has three (3) dedicated child psychiatrists that serve as the safety net for several DC core services agencies (CSAs). The PPG provides medication assessments, medication management, same day/urgent care services, and court evaluations. The DC Healthy Start program is designed to address the parent child dyad through the strengthening of attachment bonds a nd to reduce infant mortality. The program works with pre - and post -natal women residing in Wards 5, 6, 7, and 8 . System of Care Expansion Implementation Project . School -based mental health services . Prevention and Early Intervention Services . Creating multiple access entrance s to assess for mental health services. Therapy, Parent Education. Evidence Based services, ChAMPS, Same Day Urgent Care . 2. Most important unmet service needs or critical gaps in the child and youth service system: Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery Services. Substance abuse treatment options for single parents that enable f amilies to remain together during treatment, if appropriate. Better coordination with other systems. Coordination with workforce system and provision of employment readiness and supported employment. Lack of quality outpatient therapy services for latency age youth. Lack of a dedicated mental health center/agency in DC to provide public mental health and behavioral health services for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Uneven and inconsistent provision of Individualized Education Plan ( IEP) stipulated services in DC Public Schools and Public Charter Schools. If the agency could provide tokens and/or fare cards families may be more able to access clinic based services. Lack of child psychiatrists at the DC CSAs to provide consistent medication management and psychiatric services to children and adolescents. Lack of nursing staff, and Community Support Workers (CSWs) to support the work of the PPG. District of Columbia Page 4 of 6 District of Columbia OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 06/12/2015 Expires: 06/30/2018 Page 186 of 194 Need for updated equipment to support the PIECE program's evidence -based practices and day to day ope rations, e.g., contemporary telephone instruments for conference calls, no intercom system to communicate with parents during coaching sessions. Programmatic consideration that more latency age children are using K2 and other substances as the focus of tre atment. Financial support for the psychoeducational groups conducted by the DC Healthy Start program so that program staff do not have to pay out of pocket for meals /incentives for clients. Resources to help homeless services providers navigate the behavio ral health system in order to connect and support families with children identified as in need of behavioral health services. Family -based integrated services for families that brings together all health and human service providers in support of an integrated plan for families with children receiving behavioral health supports. Prevention and Early Intervention Services need the resources to serve 100% of the need. Lack of psychiatrists available to meet the growing demand of children mental health needs. CSAs have an overload of cases, which only permits the kids to receive Car Wash Services (Which means in and out services just to meet billing expectations). Therapy, Family Education. Employment, wrap around services (Psychiatrist/Psychologist/PCP, therapy, education, housing ) More community -based alternatives (therapeutic family -like settings) for youth in crisis that c annot stay with their families (e.g., therapeutic foster care without requiring entry into foster care setting). Therapeutic/recov ery oriented after school programs that focus on positive youth development. Additional focus on continuity of care for hospitalized youth. C. Other performance indicators the Behavioral Health Council would like DBH to consider in the future : Improved interface between the Integrated Care Application Management System (iCAMS) and the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale/ Preschool and Early Childhood Functional Assessment Scale (CAFAS/PECFAS) in order to more accurately collect data on child /adolescent impairments. Addition of the evidence -based practices Parent Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) and Child Parent Psychotherapy (CPP) to the iCAMs billing platform to reflect the utilization of these practices. Number of parents receiving substa nce abuse treatment through family based programs. Becoming innovative in allowing consumers to have virtual access to rate the services they receive.

The percentage of supported housing units that are integrated and accessible . The percentage of adults engaged in full or part -time employment or vocational/education activities . The percentage of youth with serious emotional disturbance s engaged in structured or therapeutic a ctivities between the hours of 3 pm and 7pm. D. Environmental Factors: Factor 5: Evidence -Based Practice for Early Intervention (5%) The continuing emphasis of DBH on investments in early intervention, such as the TACT program, is essential to building a system of care that provides comprehensive, family -focused care starting at the early detection point. This is going in the righ t direction of reducing out -of-home and more intensive psychiatric interventions.
