One vaccine to prioritize? The tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccine\u2014more commonly known as the Tdap vaccine\u2014which is recommended for people over the age of 7 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [[1]](#footnote_1). As the name implies, the Tdap vaccine is effective in preventing three common illnesses, all of which can be life threatening. Here's everything you need to know about what the Tdap vaccine is, who should get it (and how often), what its side effects look like and more.

What Is the Tdap Vaccine\u2014and What Does It Protect Against? Tdap is a vaccine that effectively prevents tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. The first illness the Tdap vaccine protects against is tetanus. Also known as lockjaw, tetanus is an infection caused by Clostridium tetani, a type of bacteria. When this bacteria gets into the body, it can cause leg muscles and jaw muscles to stiffen and \"lock\" (hence the name lockjaw). This can make swallowing and even opening the mouth difficult. Tetanus occurs when harmful bacteria enters the body through broken skin\u2014typically in the form of a puncture wound, burn, contaminated wound, crush injuries (caused by bodily pressure from a large object) or injuries with dead tissue. Tetanus can lead to a variety of health issues including involuntary tightening of the vocal cords, difficulty breathing, fractured bones, pulmonary embolisms and even death, according to the CDC. The Tdap vaccine also protects against diphtheria, another illness caused by bacteria; in this case, Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Diphtheria is typically spread from person to person through respiratory droplets, but can also be contracted when someone touches an open wound or injury containing the bacteria. Diphtheria can lead to breathing issues, damage to the heart muscle and in some cases, death, according to the CDC. Finally, the Tdap vaccine can prevent pertussis, also known as whooping cough. While pertussis can be dangerous to all populations, babies are particularly vulnerable. A type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis causes pertussis, and the disease is easily spread by air. It triggers swelling in the airway, uncontrollable coughing and, if left untreated, difficulty breathing. Whooping cough is an airborne disease, and because babies are particularly vulnerable, the Tdap vaccine is recommended during pregnancy. Who Should Get the Tdap Vaccine? The Tdap vaccine is recommended for everyone 7 years and older. \"For younger children, we use the DTaP formulation, which protects against the same three diseases,\" adds Adam J. Ratner, M.D., director of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Hassenfeld Children's Hospital at NYU Langone in New York. While certain vaccines may be completed for life after one shot or a series of shots, the Tdap vaccine requires boosters to remain effective. \"A booster against tetanus is recommended at least every 10 years,\" says Dr. Ratner. \"We also recommend getting the Tdap vaccine during pregnancy because protection against pertussis is very important for newborns. For pregnant people, we recommend one dose during late pregnancy (between 27 to 36 weeks), as many studies suggest this provides optimal protection against pertussis for newborns.\" Tdap Vaccine Schedule Protecting against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis starts in infancy, when children are at a high risk for serious disease, explains Charles Hannum, M.D., a general pediatrician at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. As mentioned previously, the formulation of the Tdap vaccine for younger children is called the DTaP. \"Children receive this vaccine at 2, 4, 6 and 15 months, and then again at 4 years,\" says Dr. Hannum. \"This vaccine protects against the same bacterium, and is formulated differently to allow the immune system to get 'upgraded' for the best protection.\" Although the Tdap vaccine is approved for people over the age of 7, the Tdap booster is typically administered around the age of 11, according to Dr. Hannum, and then every 10 years, another booster should be given. \"If you get a wound injury that puts you at risk for tetanus, sometimes we will give the vaccine early,\" Dr. Hannum adds. The Tdap vaccine is also recommended outside of the every-10-years schedule if you're pregnant. Tdap Vaccine Side Effects While you may experience some discomfort a day or two after the Tdap vaccine, side effects are rarely serious and may include pain, redness or swelling at the injection site, fever or fatigue, notes Rachel Dawkins, M.D., medical director of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine Clinics at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida. As with any vaccine, there is always the possibility of an allergic reaction, but this is very rare, adds Dr. Hannum. If you have a very high fever, swelling or difficulty breathing after a vaccine, see your doctor. \"If you think you have side effects from a Tdap vaccine, it is helpful to let your doctor know, but often, this is not a reason to avoid getting that vaccine in the future, as side effects can be expected, just like with other medications,\" says Dr. Hannum. When to See a Doctor It's always helpful to talk to your doctor about the Tdap vaccine, including asking any questions you may have. \"We want people to ask questions and talk about why these vaccines are helpful and important to the health of the individual and to the health of our general population,\" says Dr. Hannum. \"If you aren't sure when your last tetanus vaccine was, ask your doctor. They can help make sure you are staying up-to-date on the recommendation of having a new tetanus vaccine every 10 years. If you have a wound injury that puts you at risk for tetanus (or had an injury and you are not sure if you are at risk), also bring this up with your doctor.\" Any expectant parents, grandparents or anyone else who will regularly be around a newborn should talk to their doctor about the Tdap vaccine, too, as getting it could help protect the baby, Dr. Dawkins adds.
