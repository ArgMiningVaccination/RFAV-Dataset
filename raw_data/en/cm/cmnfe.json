The word Ayurveda means \"science of life\" and is the traditional holistic system of Indian medicine. The more than 3000-year old concept also uses gems for therapeutic purposes. Ayurveda gem therapy claims that every gem has properties that can help to balance specific doshas and heal certain physical or emotional conditions. Our friend Walter von Holst, one of the most important representatives of modern crystal healing research, helped us creating this blend with a focus on the seven basic Ayurvedic tissues. With this unique, colorful blend we'd like to celebrate the increasing acceptance of alternative healing approaches in the tradition of Ayurveda and the concept of modern crystal healing, for which VitaJuwel stands like no other. Dimensions: 8.9\"H x handwash lid, and gempod, disassemble gempod before cleaning. "}
