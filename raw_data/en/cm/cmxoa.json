brief explanation of the format and contents of the County of Alameda FY 201112 Budget. It should help you to understand the types of information contained in the major sections of the budget book and enable you to use the Tabl e of Contents to loca te information more readily. Budget Message : In this letter, the County Administrator highlights the major financial and policy issues contained in the budget that was submitted to the Board of Supervisors for approval. The County Administrator must present a balanced budget to the Board, and in this letter, she addresses the strategies used to balance the budget. The proposed budget is normally presented by the County Administrator to the Board of Supervisors in June. The Board of Supervisors then holds public budget hearings after presentation of the budget. The budget may be modified by the Board of Supervisors prior to its adoption after the close of the bu dget hearings. The budget may be further modified as a result of final State budget actions. County Overview : The County Overview describes the organizational structure of Alameda County Government, economic and demographic statistics on the County, and the fundin g challenges facing the County. It provides a highlevel overview of the total County of Alameda Final FY 201112 Budget. More detailed budget information for each program and department is contained in later sections of the book. ValuesBased Budget Overview: The Board of Supervisors has established program priorities for budgetin g. This section describes the priorities and lists the reductions that were made in accordance with those priorities, in order to balance the budget. Program/Department Summaries : Each major program summary includes both financial and programmatic information, so that readers can understand how funds are used to accomplish goals. Standard sections include a summary financial char t, mission statement, list of major service areas, a summary of the final budget, a summary of changes from the prior year's final budget, and major program accomplishments for each department within the program. The department summaries include more detailed information on mandated and discre tionary services and performance goals and measures. Please see the Table of Contents for a list of programs and departments. Appendix: Detailed quantitative information on specific budget units is shown here that is not included in the program summaries and fund summaries. A glossary of budget terminology is also included in this section. CBO Contract s: A list of community based organization (CBO) contracts by program, and their amounts, is located within the Appendix. Index: A subject index is included, to help you locate information by program or topic. b This page intentionally left blank i June 24, 2011 Honorable Board of Supervis ors Administration Building Oakland, CA 94612 SUBJECT: ADOPTION O F THE FY 2011- 2012 FINAL BUDGET Dear Board Members: RECOMMENDATION : It is recommended that your Board: 1. Authorize the Auditor -Controller to make necessary final adjustments and other t echnical adjustments as presented during the budget hearings and your Board's deliberations; 2. Adopt the Capital Improvement Plan for 2011-2016 ; 3. Adopt the Resolutions approving the fees for County Service Areas, Supplemental Paramedic Special Tax, Flood Control and Water Conservation District Benefit Assessment Program, and Clean Water Protection as presented on June 20 and 21, 2011; and 4. Adopt the FY 2011-2012 Final Budget. DISCUSSION/SUMMARY: The FY 2011- 2012 Final Budget, which incorporates adjustments approved by your Board during budget deliberations, is balanced. The Final Budget for all funds totals $2.48 billion and provides funding for 9,086 full -time equivalent positions. The General/Grant/Measure A Fund budgets total $2.07 billion and support 7,258 full-time equivalent positions. The Budget closes a $137.9 million funding gap through a combination of program reductions, revenue increases, Fiscal Management Reward program savings, and countywide strategies. To the extent possible, your Bo ard's Values -Based Budgeting criteria have been used to develop reductions within each program area. The following table summarizes net cost reductions required to close the funding gap: COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR ii Honorable Board of Supervisors -2- June 24, 2011 General/Grant/M easure A Funds Program Area Net County Cost Reductions (Millions) Position Reductions (FTE) General Government $ 22.6 6.59 Health Care Services Agency $ 34.1 11.91 Public Assistance $ 33.2 60.33 Public Protection $ 35.9 32.00 Countywide Strategies $ 12.1 0.00 GRAND TOTAL $137.9 110.83 The Final Budget eliminates almost 111 full- time equivalent positions to help close the $137.9 million funding gap. The funding gap has been closed using a combination of permanent ongoing program reductions, revenue increases and one -time strategies. The Final Budget uses $54.5 million in ongoing strategies and $83.4 million in one -time solutions. Fiscal Management Reward Program savings account for $56.8 million of the one- time strategies. Board Policy Directives As part of your Board's deliberations on the Proposed Budget, the following policy directives were endorsed: Reinstatement of Some General Assistance Benefits (Attachment 1) o Direct the County Administrator and the Auditor -Controller to work with the Social Services Agency Co -Directors to identify $3.0 million to restore the following General Assistance (GA) benefits: Eliminate the shared housing reduction; Eliminate the $40 medical care deduction; an d Align GA and Food Stamps resource rules for exemption of motor vehicles. o In addition, priority consideration should be given to restoring one month of GA assistance to all eligible recipients ($1.9 million annual cost) as ongoing savings in the General Assistance budget are identified through the SSI Advocacy Program beyond what is approved in the 2011-2012 Final Budget. iii Honorable Board of Supervisors -3- June 24, 2011 Restoration of In-Home Support Services Public Authority Advisory Board (Attachment 2) o Direct the County Administrator and the Auditor -Controller to work with the Social Services Agency Co -Directors to identify $50,000 to restore State budget reductions to the In- Home Support Services (IHSS) Public Authority Advisory Board in support of operational and advocacy efforts at the federal, State and local levels. Establish Working Group Regarding Redevelopment Agency Funding (Attachment 3) o In anticipation of State Budget action that would eliminate or seriously impede the Alameda Coun ty Redevelopment Agency (RDA) from implementing the $128 million in public improvement projects approved by the Board of Supervisors on February 22, 2011 (and future County investment in critical redevelopment projects): Direct the Community Development Agency Director, immediately upon enactment of any State legislation that affects RDA funding, to convene a working group consisting of staff and the two Supervisors sitting on the Unincorporated Services Committee to develop alternative funding proposals, with Supervisor Lockyer designated as an alternate member; Direct the Community Development Agency to present its recommendations for alternative funding for approved projects to the Board within two months of enactment of any such legislation; and Direct the Community Development Agency Director and County Administrator to develop a proposal for the creation of an ongoing, stable fund to be used specifically for redevelopment purposes. State and Federal Budget Impacts/Pending Factors On June 15\u2014the Constitutional deadline to enact a budget \u2014the State Legislature passed a budget plan by a majority vote, which Governor Jerry Brown promptly rejected the next day. The Legislature's budget maintained most of Governor Brown's proposed spending reductions, but notably did not include his proposal to seek voter approval to extend temporary tax increases to fund the transfer of many public safety, welfare and mental health programs to counties. Although the public protection portion of the Governor's realignment plan has been signed into law, legislation that would provide counties with a stable and constitutionally protected funding source has not. Alameda County continues to advocate for a guaranteed funding source as well as protections against litigation and the flexibility to suspend, reduce or eliminate realigned programs if funding fails to cover costs. Considerable uncertainty will remain until such time as the State budget is enacted. iv Honorable Board of Supervisors -4- June 24, 2011 In Washington, D.C., as President Obama and Congress attempt to reach agreement on a budget plan for Federal Fiscal Year 2012, concerns regarding both the size of the national debt and the consequences of not raising the debt ceiling are at the forefront of discussions. The Administration and Republicans appear to agree on the need to reduce the national debt by $4.0 trillion but have different approaches to reaching that goal. One of the potential areas of agreement is a cap on federal discretionary spending that w ould likely impact a host of federally - funded programs and the many County residents who rely on those programs. While the specifics are yet to be determined, the size of looming reductions will inevitably result in cuts to State and local government funding and programs. Partnerships and Collaborations Given the state of the economy and the magnitude of the deficits the County has faced the last three years, it is remarkable that the County continues to maintain vital services to its residents. The col laboration among County departments, agencies, community -based organizations, labor, local jurisdictions, and other stakeholders deserves much of the credit for maintaining services and improving efficiencies in County operations. Without the savings gene rated by these efforts, the severity of cuts to County services would have been much greater. To highlight just a few of these collaborations: The Social Services Agency and the Health Care Services Agency have collaborated on Medi -Cal enrollments, Suppl emental Security Income (SSI) advocacy and evaluation services, and the provision of Public Health Nursing services for In- Home Support Services (IHSS) clients. The Health Care Services Agency partners with public safety departments on a variety of programs that include teaming with the Public Defender on the Mental Health Court and conservatorship cases; collaborating with Probation to expand the Transition Center services for youth transitioning from detention to the community; supporting the District Attorney on Domestic Violence and Sexually Exploited Minor program services; assisting the Sheriff's Office in identifying Medi- Cal eligible inmates for which the County may seek reimbursements for medical services; and collaborating with the Alameda Count y Fire Department to provide child inoculation clinics and monitoring of \"frequent flyer\" emergency response patients. The Parolee Reentry Court employs a collaborative justice model and evidence -based practices to reduce recidivism, revocation and re -incarceration. In lieu of returning to prison, eligible parole violators are referred to the Parolee Reentry Court where a team comprised of a judge, a District Attorney , a Public Defender, parole agents and court -appointed case specialists meets weekly to a ccept candidates, review and advise on treatment planning, provide incentives or impose sanctions and engage with participants. The team monitors progress toward meeting goals that include completion of treatment programs, living wage employment, stable h ousing, and improved mental health and family functioning. v Honorable Board of Supervisors -5- June 24, 2011 The County continues to partner with Community -Based Organizations (CBOs) for the provision of County safety net services in a cost -efficient m anner, with almost $490 million in contracts with 242 CBOs budgeted for the coming year. For the third year in a row, the Final Budget does not include cost -of-living adjustments (COLAs) for CBOs, which helps reduce the funding gap. Our employees and labor organizations have also partnered with us to reduce costs by agreeing to forego COLAs for three years, contribute towards medical premiums, and receive a lower level of retirement benefits. Provided that the State guarantees a stable and adequate fun ding source, Public Safety Realignment may enhance our ability to provide restorative justice programs at the local level, but it will require strong collaboration. The Probation Department and the Sheriff's Office have mobilized their staffs and communit y-based partners to ensure that re -entry programs are implemented in a manner that promotes rehabilitation while safeguarding our communities. The Year Ahead In a year where passage of the State Budget has yet to be accomplished, compounded with the service cuts already enacted which have affected so many of the County's constituents, it is easy to lose sight of the many essential services and programs that are funded in the year ahead. The cover of this year's budget features the 100 Families Alameda County : Art and Social Change Project, which is one of the many innovative art initiatives sponsored by the County's Art Commission . Families residing in the neighborhood surrounding Highland Hospital created lively artwork which has been installed as a temporary mural surrounding the construction site for the new Acute Care Tower Replacement project . In the coming fiscal year, we will begin to see the steel come up out of the ground as the Specialty Clinic building nears completion. In the fifth year of the Title IV -E Waiver demonstration project, the Social Services Agency is strengthening its joint efforts with the Probation Department, Public Defender, Sheriff and various community partners. For the Social Services Agency, efforts will concentrate on prevention strategies with targeted populations: sexually exploited minors and their caregivers; American Indian youth and their families; transition age youth; and families exiting the child welfare system. New funding for Probation will focus on: community supervision and wraparound services in lieu of detention; developing continuum of care programs for diversion; weekend training academy; and re -entry and aftercare services for those returning from residential treatment centers. The Public Defender is also using Title IV-E Waiver revenue to enhance existing juvenile defense services to provide more frequent and more comprehensive reviews of post -adjudication out -of-home placements to ensure both the child's positive progress and the continued appropria teness of the setting. vi Honorable Board of Supervisors -6- June 24, 2011 Implementation of State and federal health reform offers Alameda County's health care system an unprecedented opportunity to expand services to under and uninsured residents in preparation for full implementation of Health Care Reform in 2014. Beginning in July, Alameda County will roll out the Health Plan of Alameda County ( HealthPAC ) which will expand safety net health services by over $35 million. This will be the most si gnificant expansion of indigent health services in the County's history. When fully implemented, HealthPAC will offer free comprehensive health benefits to approximately 60,000 residents through expansion of Medi -Cal and another 107,000 individuals will r eceive a sliding scale subsidy via the new California Health Care Exchange. Despite the controversy surrounding the use of redevelopment proceeds to help balance the State Budget, Alameda County has implemented responsible projects that expand and preserve affordable housing opportunities for low - and moderate -income residents, and promote infrastructure improvements, property development and job creation in the unincorporated area communities. Construction of the Ashland Teen Center is expected to commen ce in addition to the design of both the Cherryland Fire Station and the San Lorenzo Library expansion. The award -winning County Library system anticipates more than five million library visits in the year ahead. Attendance at economy -based programs has increased by 30% by providing residents with practical ways to deal with the challenges of the recession. Special programming for children and teens include the Summer Reading Game and the \"Booklegger Program\" which uses volunteers to give book talks to school age children. The Stanley Boulevard Safety and Streetscape Project will provide safety, multi -modal, and beautification improvements. Showcasing leadership and innovation, this project is the first rural expressway project of its kind to incorporate significant safety and sustainable features to transform an industrial -looking corridor into a beautiful recreational corridor. Safety improvements such as utility undergrounding and guardrails have been seamlessly incorporated into the beautification ef forts. Sustainability elements are extensive and include the use of recycled water for irrigation, Bay Friendly certified landscaping, and recycled construction materials. vii Honorable Board of Supe rvisors -7- June 24, 2011 The County's efficiency initiative s continue to improve operations while reducing costs. By reducing office space, minimizing tenant im provement costs, and expanding reuse and repurposing of furniture and equipment, the County has helped improve landfill diversion by 1.6 million pounds. A planned consolidation of printers and copiers will combine multiple departments/agencies' existing copier leases into one countywide contr act to improve pricing and services. Similar efforts are underway to analyze cell phone plans, rates and usage to optimize use and reduce costs. The Informati on Technology Department has worked with all County agencies and departments to eliminate unnecessary costs from duplicate systems, increase system availability a nd reliability, expand e-government services to the public, and improve services throughout the County. The County continues its l eadership role with its sustainability initiatives. The new comprehensive Environmentally Preferable Purchasing Policy applies County buying power to promote greener products in the market. Implementation of the Climate Action Plan for County government is underway with nine agency heads sponsoring six cross- agency initiatives. With the completion of its solar panel installation, the new Castro Valley Library is nearly 100% sola r powered, bringing County's onsite solar generation capability to 3.5 megawatts. The General Services Ag ency is also leading a regional, multi- jurisdictional consortium to purchase 90 all-electric vehicles and install 80 electric vehicle charging stations at County facilities with funding from a Department of Transportation grant. Although there has been no Genera l Fund increase in capital expenditures for several years, the budget does include designated funding to proceed with the East County Courthouse project and relocation of the Crime Lab and Coroner's Bureau to the County-owned Peralta Oaks facility. In addition, the County is proceed ing with plans to replace Camp Sweeney with State grant funds awarde d through a competitive process. Closing Remarks This is the third consec utive year of triple-dig it funding gaps that have required more difficult decisions resulting in further downsizing of our workforce and operations. Our ability to continue providing vital services to our resi dents through the recession, slow economic recovery and unprecedented federal and Stat e budget deficits is a testament to our strong leadership team, commitment to partnerships and collaboration, and unwavering support of Alameda County's mission and vision. viii Honorable Board of Supe rvisors -8- June 24, 2011 Once again, I extend my gratitude to all of the Agency and De partment Heads for their ongoing efforts to curtail expenditures in anticipation of this budget year and for their significant contributions toward achieving a balanced bud get. I also would like to acknowledge the guidance and support of the Budget Workgroup memb ers. And, finally, I would like to thank your Board for the strong support and leadership you have provided during the FY 2011-2012 budget process, as well as your ongoing commitment to an open and inclusive process that has involved all stakeholders. Very truly yours, /s/ Susan S. Muranishi County Administrator SSM Attachments c: Agency/Department Heads Budget Workgroup Legislative Advocates Labor Representatives Community-Based Organizations Boards and Commissions ix x xi xii xiii xiv June 9, 2011 Honorable Board of Supervisors Administration Building Oakland, California 94612 SUBJECT: FISCAL YEAR 2011 -2012 PROPOSED BUDGET Dear Board Members: Over the past two years, your Board has closed deficits totaling $330 million and, due to the lingering effects of the recession, faces another triple digit funding gap for the coming year. Despite the difficult fiscal climate, the Fiscal Year 2011 -2012 Proposed Budget is balanced and closes a $137.9 million funding gap in a responsi ble manner that maximizes Alameda County's ability to provide vital services to its residents. As you know, the health of the national, State and local economies profoundly affects Alameda County's fiscal well -being. A vigorous economy provides jobs and benefits for Alameda County residents and enough revenues to pay for County services. During a severe economic downturn, such as the one from which we hope we are emerging, the balance is knocked off kilter. As job losses mount, the County's finances no longer support the greater demand for County services. Over the past year, economic signs have generally indicated that a recovery is underway and accelerating its pace. Unfortunately, thus far the recovery has been modest. Unemployment remains stubbornly high, and most economists anticipate a protracted recovery period before the number of jobs returns to pre -recession levels. Some have an even more pessimistic view, predicting that, due to a variety of factors, job levels in some industries will never fully return, calling into question not only when but if the country will recover the eight million jobs lost during the recession. Moreover, several reports from recent weeks have put a damper on some of the optimism surrounding the economy. The United States added just 54,000 new jobs in May, sharply lower than the approximately 220,000 jobs added in each of the three prior months. There was also bad news regarding manufacturing, housing and car sales, resulting in an almost 5% decline in the stock ma rket in five weeks. COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR xv Honorable Board of Supervisors -2- June 9, 2011 California experienced a deeper recession than the country as a whole, and the rate of recovery has been slower. In 2010, California added a net of only 82,000 nonfarm jobs, a growt h rate of just half a percent. At such a slow pace it will take years to recover the more than one million jobs the State has lost during the recession. Alameda County's unemployment rate has been somewhat better than the State average, but it has still hovered around 10% for over two years, compared to pre-recession levels of about 5%. The housing market, the collapse of which is widely blamed for the economic downturn, has stabilized over the past year. Median home prices in Alameda County are still d own 45% from their peak, but are 21% higher than the low point. Beacon Economics predicts a long recovery for the housing market and anticipates high levels of defaults and foreclosures for the foreseeable future. As distressed properties sell for lower prices, and their assessed valuations decline, the County's property tax revenue will be negatively impacted. In addition to economic problems, ongoing budget difficulties at the State and federal levels impact the County's finances. This is the ninetee nth consecutive year that the State has shifted local property taxes to help balance its budget, with $4.3 billion of Alameda County property tax revenues transferred to the State during that time. Not surprisingly, Alameda County has faced funding gaps i n each of those years. The State continues to look to local government to help solve its budget problems, the latest proposal being Governor Brown's plan to shift almost $6 billion in criminal justice, health and welfare programs from the State to local government. Known as \"realignment,\" the Governor has proposed extending temporary tax increases for five years to pay for the costs of transferring these programs. Whether the Legislature or the voters have the inclination to extend these tax increases is uncertain, along with what occurs absent the additional tax revenues. In addition, the methodology for allocating funding to counties is unknown, and thus many counties are concerned that State funding will fall short of costs. The Governor has also proposed taking redevelopment dollars from local agencies, as well as delaying payments, and additional borrowing from local governments. At the federal level, there is growing concern about annual deficits that exceed $1 trillion and a national debt in excess of $14 trillion. While Congress and the President continue to discuss raising the debt ceiling, the Obama Administration warns that if an agreement is not reached by August 2, the United States may default on some of its borrowing obligations, risking a financial catastrophe. We can expect reductions in federal spending in the current and future years as the federal government tries to bring its budget more into balance. The combination of increased demand for County services, lower revenues to pay for those services, and cuts in State and federal funding creates an extremely challenging fiscal environment as we head into Fiscal Year 2011-2012 and beyond. xvi Honorable Board of Supervisors -3- June 9, 2011 BUDGET OVERVIEW The 2011- 2012 Proposed Budget for all funds totals $2.5 billion, an increase of $25 million, or 1%, from the 2010- 11 Final Budget. The General/Grant/Measure A funds budget, which funds most County operations, totals $2.1 billion, a decrease of $44.9 million, or 2.1%. All Funds ($ billions) 2010 -11 Final 2011 -12 MOE 2011 -12 Proposed Change from 2010 -11 Appropriation $2.44 $2.54 unds ($ billions) 2010 -11 Final 2011 -12 MOE 2011 -12 Proposed Change from 2010-11 Budget includes funding to provide mandated and essential services, meet debt service obligations, maintain a minimum level of infrastructure and capital funding, and adhere to the Board's Financial Management policies. The Proposed Budget supports a workforc e of 9,049 full -time equivalent (FTE) positions and reflects a net staffing decrease of 54 FTE, including mid -year Board -approved staffing increases of 57 FTE, offset by a reduction of 111 FTE as part of budget balancing. Most employee labor organizatio ns have agreed to forego annual cost -of-living adjustments (COLAs) for three years and pay a share of health benefit premiums, thereby reducing employee salaries and benefit costs and the size of the budget gap. In addition, all of our public safety unions have agreed to reduce the pension benefits newly -hired employees receive. Despite these concessions and better investment returns by the Alameda County Employees' Retirement Association (ACERA), there remains over $263 million in investment losses that have not yet been recognized which will contribute to a rise in both the employer and employee contribution rates over the next few years. xvii Honorable Board of Supervisors -4- June 9, 2011 For the third year in a row, the Proposed Budget does not recommend COLAs for community - based organizations (CBOs). Nevertheless, the Proposed Budget provides almost $490 million for services provided by 242 CBOs, many with multiple contracts with the County. This amount includes $114 million in health care services provided by the Alameda County Medical Center (ACMC). Other CBOs funded in the Proposed Budget include non- profit service providers, cities, school districts, and local hospitals. A list of all CBO contracts with funding recommendations is contained in the Proposed Budget Book. The lack of COLAs and other funding reductions affecting CBOs and ACMC could impact or reduce services provided by our community-based partners. Measure A, the voter -approved half -cent sales tax, provides funding for essential health care services. Seventy -five percent of the revenue is earmarked for ACMC, while the remaining 25% is allocated by the Board of Supervisors to support essential health services. The Proposed Budget includes $20.4 million in Measure A funds for non- ACMC essential health services, which includes only the amount that the Board of Supervisors had approved at the time of establishing the budget. Subsequently, the Board approved an additional $6.1 million following a public hearing, which will be reflected in the Final Budget. The Final Budget for non- ACMC essential health services will be $26.5 million, an increase of $4.5 million, or 20%, compared to FY 2010-11 budgeted revenues. Consistent with your Board's Financial Management policies, contingencies for pending labor negotiations and benefit cost increases, higher unemployment insurance costs, contractual obligations, and a $4.9 million general reserve increase are included in the Proposed Budget. Discretionary revenue continues to be impacted by t he State's ongoing transfers of property tax revenues from local governments to meet its obligation to fund schools. Known as the Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund (ERAF), since ERAF began in 1992- 93, Alameda County has shifted $4.3 billion in local discretionary funds to the State, including an expected loss of $326 million in the coming fiscal year. With recent State budget- balancing strategies and shifts, including the swap of vehicle license fee (VLF) and local sales tax revenue for ERAF, discreti onary revenues now represent only 26% of the County's General Fund budget. Moreover, 90% of the County's limited discretionary revenue is now property tax -based. These taxes are supported by a local assessment roll that declined in each of the last two y ears after not having decreased in at least 50 years. In FY 2011- 12, we do not expect the assessment roll to decline, but the anticipated increase of 1% is very modest compared to the 8% average annual growth we have seen historically. xviii Honorable Board of Supervisors -5- June 9, 2011 CLOSING THE GAP \u2014The Proposed Budget closes a $137.9 million funding gap that was projected based on the Maintenance of Effort (MOE) funding requirement. The funding gap was determined by identifying the difference between the cost of maintaining existing programs and available financing. The MOE Budget for General/Grant/Measure A Funds totaled $2.12 billion, an increase of $21.8 million, or 1.0%. Available revenues to finance the projected MOE costs totaled $1.98 billion, a decrease of $116.1 million, or 5.5%. To the extent possible, your Board's Values -Based Budgeting priorities and Strategic Vision initiatives have been considered in developing balancing strategies within each program area. The table below summarizes the total proposed net cost reductions by program area: BUDGET BALANCING General/Grant/Measure A Funds Program Area Net County Cost Reductions ($ millions) General Government $22.6 Health Care Services Agency $34.1 Public Assistance $33.2 Public $35.9 Strategies $12.1 Total $137.9M The $137.9 million funding gap has been closed using a combination of permanent ongoing program reductions, revenue increases, and one -time strate gies. The Proposed Budget recommends the use of $54.5 million or 40% in ongoing strategies and $83.4 million or 60% in one-time strategies. The 40% use of ongoing strategies represents an improvement over the 31% in ongoing strategies used to close the FY 2010- 11 funding gap. As in past years, most of the one-time strategies come via the Fiscal Management Reward Program (FMR) savings. These savings, which total $56.8 million for the 2011 -2012 Proposed Budget, have been generated through the ongoing efforts of Departments/Agencies throughout the years to operate their programs efficiently and effectively within budget, to avoid further program and staffing reductions. While a structural imbalance between ongoing revenues and expenditures remains, FMR sav ings allows for the preservation of vital services. xix Honorable Board of Supervisors -6- June 9, 2011 Budget Balancing Strategies Net County Cost Reductions ($ millions) Ongoing Strategies Program reductions $61.1 Program revenue increases $22.4 CalWORKs revenue losses ($29.0) Subtotal Ongoing Strategies $54.5 Fiscal Management Reward Savings $56.8 One-time revenues $9.4 Use of Available Fund Balance $7.1 1% allocation for capital projects $5.0 Use of Prop. 172 Designation $3.0 One-time appropriation reductions $2.1 Subtotal One -Time Strategies $83.4 Total Balancing Strategies $137.9 M PROGRAM AREA NET COST REDUCTIONS General Government (including Internal Service Funds) - Budget balan cing reductions total $22.6 million through appropriation reductions of $4 million, increased fee revenue of $600,000, and the use of Fiscal Management Reward Program savings of $17.8 million. Additionally, program savings of $250,000 were achieved by the Information Technology Department (ITD) which resulted in a corresponding decrease in charges to several County departments. Appropriation reductions include the elimination of seven vacant positions, reduced use of supplies and contracted services, and other savings efforts. Fee revenue was increased for the processing of property assessment appeals and the provision of vital records such as birth and death certificates, marriage licenses and divorce decrees in order to recover the cost of providing these services. Health Care - Net cost savings total $34.1 million through $4.1 million in appropriation reductions, $14.5 million in increased revenue, and $15.5 million in Fiscal Management Reward program savings. The appropriation reductions include the elimination of 12 vacant positions, which may impact the provision of mental health services and staffing for Medi -Cal claiming and tracking activities, alcohol and drug services, and training for clinicians delivering services to clients. The revenue increases include Mental Health Services Act revenue of almost $12 million achieved through the redesign of service models in several program areas, as well as additional revenue from improved Measure A sales tax receipts, and the use of one- time Tobacco Master Settlement funds. xx Honorable Board of Supervisors -7- June 9, 2011 Public Assistance - Net cost savings total $33.2 million. State -imposed changes to CalWORKs and In- Home Supportive Services allocations and requirements reduced appropriations by $33.3 million but also reduced revenues by $28.5 million, resulting in a net cost savings for the Social Services Agency of $4.8 million. These State cuts reduce recipient aid payments, service provider reimbursement rates, and overall service levels. Other reductions of $11.6 million in appropriations and $1.8 million in increased revenues result in an additional $13.4 million in savings. These reductions include the elimination of 60 vacant positions and other staffing changes, facilities consolidation s, and caseload adjustments. Reinvestments of the Title IV -E Waiver, a source of federal funding to support child welfare services, and State Supplemental Security Disability Income reimbursement funds, are expected to significantly enhance client outcome s by emphasizing family support and reunification in foster care programs and moving eligible aid recipients on to more stable income. Additionally, $15 million in Fiscal Management Reward program savings contributes to the Public Assistance program area cost savings. Public Protection - Net cost savings of $35.9 million includes $8.4 million in appropriation reductions. The elimination of 32 positions from the Sheriff's Office, the Probation Department, the District Attorney's Office, and the Public Def ender may reduce flexibility at the jails and impact other services such as training and administrative services. Other reductions may impact the provision of adult inmate services at both County jails. In addition, services provided to youth at the Juvenile Justice Center, including investigative activities and juvenile supervision, may be affected. Increased revenue of $19.1 million is largely achieved through increasing Proposition 172 public safety sales tax estimates and federal Title IV -E waiver funding in the Probation Department for youth services. Additionally, $8.5 million in Fiscal Management Reward program savings contributes to the Public Protection program areas cost savings. FISCAL MANAGEMENT REWARD (FMR) PROGRAM SAVINGS Your Board's Fiscal Management Reward Program allows General Fund departments to carry over net savings each fiscal year to be used in subsequent years for budget balancing, one -time expenditures and program enhancements. Through ongoing cost -saving and revenue generation efforts, County agencies/departments contributed $56.8 million in prior -year FMR savings to help balance the FY 2011-12 budget. Program Area Use of FMR ($ millions) General Government $17.8 Health Care $15.5 Public Assistance $15.0 Public Protect ion $ 8.5 Total FMR $56.8M xxi Honorable Board of Supervisors -8- June 9, 2011 While the cost saving efforts of all County departments are commendable, the continued reliance on prior -year savings for budget balancing poses certain risks for the County. As budgets are reduced and more positions are left vacant or eliminated, it may become more difficult for departments to carry out their mission of providing quality, essential services and continue to achieve commensurate savings in subsequent y ears. COUNTYWIDE STRATEGIE S The following countywide strategies contribute $12.1 million towards balancing the FY 2011- 12 Proposed Budget: $7.1 million from anticipated one- time year -end fund balance; and $5.0 million reduction in appropriations by suspending the Board's policy to allocate one percent of discretionary revenue to Capital Projects. Prior- year FMR savings, reduced program appropriations, additional program revenues, and countywide strategies are available to close the current $137.9 million funding gap for Fiscal Year 2011- 2012. However, we must continue to identify additional strategies in anticipation of significant program cuts and additional County costs related to pending federal and State budget actions. PENDING FACTORS: FEDERAL AND STATE BUDGETS With the federal and State governments supplying over half of the County's revenues, fiscal problems in Sacramento and Washington have a significant impact on local government finances. Governor Brown should be commended for addressing the State's fiscal problems with realistic, pragmatic solutions, rather than shifting problems to future years. However, the Governor and Legislature have still not agreed on a spending plan for FY 2011-12. Governor Brown's proposal to extend higher tax rates to fund the transfer of programs to local government has yet to receive traction with Republicans. Absent higher revenues from tax increases, redevelopment agencies or other sources, the State is facing the prospect of an \"all cuts\" budget. Such a budget would certainly mean drastic reductions in funding for public education, public safety, and health and human services programs. The cuts already adopted by the State will have a grave impact on the poor, including cuts to services for seniors and people with disabilities, reduced supportive housing services, and cuts to programs for the homeless, violence-prevention programs for youth, and employment services for homeless people. xxii Honorable Board of Supervisors -9- June 9, 2011 A partial list of cuts already adopted include: Over 20,000 CalWORKs recipients in Alameda County will be affected by cuts that include: reducing the amount of time adults may receive aid from 60 months to 48 months; reducing the maximum aid payment by 8%; reducing County funding for employment services and child care; and reducing the maximum income to qualify for assistance. Over 18,000 providers and recipients of In -Home Supportive Services (IHSS) in Alameda County have already been affected by a 3.6% reduction in se rvice hours that went into effect in February 2011 as part of the 2010- 2011 budget. FY 2011- 2012 budget cuts include $486 million in IHSS savings to be identified later, which will certainly further impact IHSS recipients. Recent cuts to the Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment (SSI/SSP) cash assistance program would affect approximately 39,000 recipients in Alameda County, resulting in lost income. Since 2008- 2009, the State has reduced the size of these grants multiple times and susp ended three cost -of-living adjustments. The California Budget Project estimates that the cumulative impact of these cuts is equivalent to approximately $3,600 for each SSI/SSP recipient. Approximately 80,000 to 100,000 Alameda County Medi -Cal recipients could be affected by reductions in the program through: mandatory co- pays for doctor visits, prescriptions and dental services, and caps on services for hearing aids, cough and cold products, and doctor visits (with exemptions). Replacing the Adult Day Health program with less funding for a transitional program could lead to the closure of nine centers in Alameda County currently serving over 880 frail seniors and adults with disabilities. Reduction in benefits and increased premiums and co- pays in the Healthy Families Program may affect 15,000 Alameda County children who receive low -cost health, dental, and vision coverage, and who would otherwise be uninsured. xxiii Honorable Board of Supervisors -10- June 9, 2011 There are also many uncertainties reg arding Governor Brown's realignment proposal. Even if the Legislature or voters agree to the proposed tax extensions, the extensions expire in five years. While the Governor has said the State will continue to fund any realigned programs after five years , we have no assurance that the State will honor the current Governor's promise when the proposed extensions expire. In addition, the allocation of funding to counties is unknown, and based on past experience may not be adequate to support the programs and costs shifted from the State to local government. Clearly, California must reduce its prison population, as reaffirmed by a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that upheld a three- judge panel ruling requiring the State to reduce prison overcrowding. If the Governor and Legislature fail to agree on a revenue solution, we cannot rule out the possibility of the State transferring the prisoners and program responsibilities without adequate funding. The economy, State and federal budget problems, and other factors pose significant challenges to our finances and operations. However, your Board has made difficult decisions and adopted responsible, pragmatic budgets that address rather than delay and compound problems, which puts Alameda County in a relatively strong fiscal position. Prior to the onset of the recession, Alameda County was one of the fastest growing economies in the State, and we expect to return to that position. However, given the severity of the downturn and the prolonged recovery, the impa ct to residents and County services will be felt for several more years. RECOMMENDATIONS The FY 2011- 2012 Proposed Budget is balanced and reflects the County's commitment to providing vital services to County residents in spite of the difficult economic times. The Proposed Budget may require substantial adjustments following revisions to the State and federal budgets. In addition, balancing the budget using a significant amount of one -time funds will necessitate careful monitoring throughout the year to ensure that expenditures remain within budget and revenue estimates are fully realized. As you conduct public hearings and deliberate on the Proposed Budget, your Board will be faced with very difficult choices. Your ongoing leadership and strong fiscal management will assist the County in once again maintaining that critical balance between service demands and limited financial resources. xxiv Honorable Board of Supe rvisors -11- June 9, 2011 Therefore, it is recommended that your Board: 1. Accept the Proposed Budget for FY 2011-2012 for review pending public hearings; 2. Set public hearings on the Pr oposed Budget to commence on June 20, 2011 at 12:30 p.m. as outlined in the Attachment; and 3. Schedule public hearings and/or public mee tings to consider charges for Emergency Medical Services District, Vector Control, Flood Control Districts, Urban Runoff Clean Water Program, County Service Areas, Fire Emergency Medical Services, and Lead Abatement as detailed in the attached budget hearing schedule.

Karlsson ZONE 7 WATER AGENCY Jill Duerig General Manager ALAMEDA COUNTY OVERVIEW DEMOGRAPHICS 3 Alameda County was established in 1853. The County was created from the territory of two counties created in 1850: Contra Costa and Santa Clara. It was given the local name for the region, Alameda, which translated loosely as \"a grove of poplars.\" The County enjoys a varied geography ranging from urban marinas to rolling open spaces to hillside lakes and streams. Alameda is the seventh most populous county in California, and has 14 incorporated cities and several unincorporated communities. The total population is estimated to be 1,510,271 as of April 2010, a 4.6% increase from April 2000. During the same time period, California's population rose 10%. Oakland is the seat of County governmen t and the largest city. Source: Census 2010 Alameda County is characterized by rich diversity and culture. Population growth has occurred with the natural net increase of births over deaths, but also from substantial immigration, and Alameda County is now one of the most ethnically diverse regions in the Bay Area and the nation. The 2010 Census shows that there is no majority racial or ethni c group in Alameda County. Compared to the 2000 Census, the Black/African American population decreased countywide by 11%, the Asian population increased by 31%, and the Hispanic population increased by 23%. According to the California Department of Education, 53 languages were spoken by English language learne rs in the K12 public school systems in Alameda County in 2008 09.

The nation has not seen this level of joblessness in several decades , and unemployment is expected to remain elevated for some time. Alameda County Unemployment Rate Since Recession Began Source: California Economic Development Department In April 2011, the national unemployment rate was 8.7%, compared to 11.7 % in California and 10.3% in Alam eda County . Alameda County Median Home Values Alameda County 's medi an home value was $338,000 as of April 2011. While higher than the March 2009 low, the median is still down 45 % from the peak of $619,000 in August 2007. ALAMEDA COUNTY OVERV IEW ECONOMIC UPDATE 5 The assessed value of prop erty is what determines how much property taxes the County will receive. In FY 2009- 10, for the first time since at least the 1950s, the assessment roll declined. The FY 2010 -11 local assessment roll declined 1.4% from the prior year, reflecting a $2.9 b illion drop in assessed value. This was the second consecutive drop in assessed value after not having experienced declines in at least half a century. About 90% of Alameda County's discretionary revenue comes from property tax although the County receives only 15% of the property tax collected. The balance goes to other entities , such as cities and schools. Assessment Roll Growth, Alameda County Source: Alameda County Assessor's Office Assessment Appeals Filed Since 2004 Source: Alameda County Clerk of the Board, Assessment Appeals Unit Home Foreclosures Since 2005 Source: Alameda County Auditor/Controller Assessment appeals have increased significantly as taxpayers seek to have their property tax valuations reduced. The number of appeals in the current year is almost 6,000, well above normal levels. Reduced property taxes decrease the amount of revenue available to fund necessary safety net services for County residents. A further indicator of the economic downturn and its impact on Alameda County residents is the number of home foreclosures, which number in the thousands annually, compared to the low hundreds. The number of delinquent property tax payments (not shown) has also risen dramatically the past few years.

Use of Title IV -E waiver funds provides continuity of funding for Juvenile Probation and Public Defender programs. In Probation adult and juvenile services , miscellaneous expenditure reductions and phase -out of positions may limit program support services. In Probation juvenile services and institutions, the elimination of a vacant Deputy Probation Officer and an Institutional Supervisor may reduce the department's capacity to investigate and supervise juvenile defendants, wards of the court and probationers at the Juvenile Justice Center. Elimination of vacant positions may impact future support and legal service capacity in the Public Defender's Office. Elimination of vacant positions and staffing changes in the Sheriff's Office may increase the amount of time needed to provid e inmate services including medical services, food, clothing, and transportati on, as well as reduce staffing available to process payroll and other financial transactions. Reduced Discretionary Services and Supplies in the Sheriff's Office may curtail staff training and impact administrative services provided at the Regional Traini ng Center, Crime Lab, and Office of Emergency Services.

The Financial Summary for 2010 -11 has been adjusted to include these services in or der to achieve an accurate change amount between the two fiscal years. Three new programs have been added: Youth and Family Service Hubs, Ashland Youth Center, and Youth Development - La Clinica. ** The reduction in net c ounty cost of $5,720,423 was the result of an adjustment of revenue and cost allocations in Behavioral Health Care Services following a review by the Department of the original budget submission. The final figures more accurately report the amount of federal funding available for childr en's services in the Department, as reflected in the increased revenue of $9,956,907 seen in the final budget figures. The increase in appropriations of $4,236,484 was primarily the result of a Board -approved Measure A two- year reallocation process that w as completed during the final stage of the budget. ABOUT THE CHILDREN'S SERVICES BUDGET The Children's Services budget is an informational summary that presents the full array of children's programs and services provided by County departments and agencies in collaboration with other governmental and community partners. As a distinct section within the overall County budget, it is intended to provide a window on the County's fiscal commitment to children's services. The budgeted amounts for these services are included in the budget chapters for the respective departments elsewhere in the budget book. CHILDREN'S SERVICES BUDGET INFORMATION The total appropriation for C hildre n's S ervices for Fiscal Year 2011 -12 is $ 619,484,833. Revenues are estimated at $ 525,3 81,552, and the net county cost is $94,103,281. Total spending has been reduced from the prior year by $25,132,771, largely due to State and federal funding reductions. Of particular note, there was a $29,934,221 reduction in State CalWORKS funding. Net county costs increased by $1,365,923. METHODOLOGY The Children's Services budget includes all spending on programs that explicitly assist children, and spending on adults in programs where adults receive services only because of the presence of a child (for example, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ). A child, for the purposes of this children's services budget, is defined for the majority of programs as age 0-18 years (that is, up to the eighteenth birthday). However, some services are provided beyon d the age of 18 (for example , for youth emancipating from foster care) ; those funds are included in this budget and identified in the services tables. ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGRAM SUMMAR Y CHILDREN'S SERVICES 40 CHILDREN'S BUDGET SUMMARIES 201112 Funding sources 201112 Funding for children's services provided by the County for FY 201112 totals $525,381,552. The net County cost for children's services is $94,103,281 million. Federal, State and other sources provide the remaining funding. Children's Services Budget service type comparison As mentioned in the Methodology section, the Children's Services budget includes all spending on programs that explici tly assist children, as well as spending on adults in programs where they receive services only because of the presence of a child (for example, TANF). Below is a table that breaks out the budget according to these two types of services. Of note is the difference in County cost between the two categori es, underscoring both the commitment of the County to children in need and the underfunding of important services for children.

To reach this goal, we strive to ensure that all children receive the support and security that a family, an extended family, or an alternative family can provide. Mandated Services There are four componen t s to Child Welfare services in California in compliance with federal mandates. These are Emergency Response, Family Maintenance, Family Reunification, and Permanent Planning. In Alameda County, services extend significantly beyond what is mandated to fill gaps in funding for prevention services. Due in large part to the successful implementation of the Title IVE Child Welfare Waiver Capped Allocation Project, a wide range of innovative and preventive programs have been developed. Service Highlights The Department's participation in the fiveyear federal waiver demonstration allows federal dollars to be used more flexibly to improve child welfare outcomes. This has resulted in the implem en tation of a range of innovative programs and strategies. It has also meant that Alameda County is able to expand staffing and service resources at a time when most counties are experiencing severe budget reductions and cutbacks. The major service strategies being implemented are summarized on the next page. Challenges for 2011 12 During the upcoming fiscal year, the department will focus on the successful implementation of AB 12, the extension of foster care for youth until their 21st birthday, and modifications to the KinGap (kinship guardianship) program. The department will also begin to evaluate the Title IVE Waiver programs for efficacy.

Most CalWORKs recipients are also eligible for CalFresh (formerly Food Stamps) and MediCal benefits. Recipients, unless exempt, must participate in welfare towork activities, and are eligible for child care and other support services to help gain and retain employme nt. Mandated Services The Agency provides eligibility services and benefits, social services, enrollment, retention and participation in health coverage programs, and continuing economic and nutritional support. Services Highlights As a result of the implementation of provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestmen t Act (ARRA), the Agency implemented AC Hire, which resulted in employment for approximately 1,300 CalWORKs families and individuals below 200 percent Federal Poverty Level. In addition to, and as a result of ARRA, the Workforce Investment Board (WIB) placed 633 youth between the ages of 14 - 21 in summer jobs, with a total of 96% completi ng th e program and 40 youth remaining employed after the Summer Youth Employment Program ended. Challenges for 2011 - 2012 Given the economic climate, the Agency will be challenged with providing mandated services by streamlining current functions within administration and program, while ensuring effici ency and continuity of services to the most vulnerable and needy families in our community. Most notably, the Agency's mandate to increase the Work Participation Rate (WPR) by engaging and enrolling recipients into the welfare to work program will become increasingly difficult.

None Y CHILDREN'S SERVICES 85 CHILD CARE PLANNING COUNCIL Purpose State law requires the establishment of a local Child Care Planning Council to work toward availability and affordability of highquality child care and to identify priorities for federal Child Care and Development Block Grant funds. In 1997, the County Superintendent of Schools and the County Board of Supervisors became the governing and appointi ng bodi es. Councils serve as a forum to address the child care needs of all families in the community and all child care programs. Mandated Services The 35member Alameda County Child Care Planning Council (CCPC) has a mandated composition of consumers, providers, public agency representatives, and community representatives. Staff coordinate the CCPC, over see the County employee child care center, coordinate child care and land use planning, perform feasibility studies for County buildings, and work as requested on unincorporated County child care projects and planning. Service Highlights Recent major accomplishments include convening local subsidized early care and education programs to retain over $74 million dollars in subsidies serving 8,300 childre n through the County. Other accomplishments include: overseeing a training program for over 1,000 teachers; leading and initiating efforts to leverage grant funding of $1.4 million over 10 years; promoting best practices on quality, cultural responsiveness, early childhood mental health consultation and inclusion; and leadi ng policy work for children with special needs. Challenges for 201112 The 20112012 state budget cut approximately $400 million statewide from child care. Additional cuts in December, 2011, may be triggered by low state revenue estimates, and would make maintaining the existing subsidized child care system and related planning and suppor t infrastructure very challenging, with state s upport for the Child Care Planning Council already reduced by 50% in 20102011. Proposed realignment of child care services in the future will also entail significant planning.

Additionally, program savings of $250,000 were achieved by the Information Technology Department (ITD) which resulted in a corresponding dec rease in charges to several County departments for ITD services. Appropriation reductions include the elimination of seven vacant positions, reduced use of supplies and contracted services, and other internal cost -saving mechanisms. Service impacts from these reductions include the loss of funds for future one -time needs, increased service delivery times, and the delay in the implementation of programs to increase departmental efficiencies. Fee revenue was increased for the processing of property assessment appeals and the provision of vital records such as birth and death certificates, marriage licenses and divorce decrees in order to recover the cost of providing these services.

The reduction in miscellaneous expenditures in the Auditor -Controller's Agency may cause some projects to be delayed, but there will be no service impact t o clients. Reduced expenditures in the Clerk, Board of Supervisors, may result in the department's inability to upgrade the online agenda and broadcasting system. Staff and supply reductions in the General Services Agency (GSA) Administration Division will impact the department's Quality Management program and its ability to evaluate service delivery systems and procedures, thus delaying improvements in areas of cost and quality control throughout the agency. Reductions in support staffing, overtime and supplies in the Purchasing and the Property and Salvage divisions will increase the task load for those workers with more complex assignments which may have negative impact on the service delivery to user departments. Reducing the support staffing in the Par king Division may have a negative impact on service delivery and data management. Elimination of vacant positions should not impact service levels for the Treasurer/Tax Collector.

These projects benefit the various commu nities of the unincorporated area of Alameda County through economic development and the creation of affordable housing. The County is currently partnering with various organizations to finalize development of alternatives which meet State budget goals without eliminating redevelopment at the local level Alameda County covers costs for Unemployment Insurance for qualifying dislocated workers, which is a State requirement. These costs have increased significantly since 2008, due to several factors includin g a federal extension of Unemployment benefits as a result of the downturn in the economy. Escalating retirement costs are a major contributor to the budget increases for general government departments. MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENT S IN 2010- 11 INCLUDE: ASSESSOR'S OFFICE Timely submitted the 2010 -2011 local assessment roll of $199.7 billion, containing 443,000 real estate parcels and 47,000 business property accounts. This 1.43% decrease from 2009 -2010 recognized the decline in market value below Proposition 13 levels of over 110,000 properties. Further enhanced the capability of the property valuation program to provide an accurate, efficient and proactive annual review of properties for declines in market value. This practice reduces the need for taxpayers to fil e assessment appeals and saves the County the cost of adjudicating thousands of formal appeal applications. Deployed the final phase of a new computer -based comparable sales and rental data retrieval module to facilitate staff's analysis and appraisal of commercial and industrial properties.

Service Impacts Use of Fiscal Management Reward Program savings will result in the loss of these funds for future one-time needs. Staff and supply reductions in the General Services Agency (GSA) Administration Division will impact the department's Quality Management program and its ability to evaluate service delivery systems and procedures, thus delaying improvements in areas of cost and quality control thro ughout the agency. Reductions in support staffing, overtime use, and supplies in the Purchasing and the Property and Salvage divisions will increase the task load for those workers with more complex assignments, which may have a potential negative impact on the service delivery for the divisions. Reducing the support staffing in the Parking Division while the division is experiencing service growth will have an anticipated negative impact on service delivery and data management.

The reduction in the Telecare contract for training services will reduce the availability of training for staff that would ensure clinicians delivering services to clients remain effective, knowledgeable, and able to deliver culturally relevant services to a diverse population; however, this line item in Telecare's budget has been traditionally underspent. The loss of State funding for the Bay Area Services Network (BASN) will impact the agencies in the network providing outpatient substance use disorder se rvices and result in reduced services. Loss of State funding for California Work Opportunity & Responsibility to Kids (CalWORK s) mental health services contracts will deprive clients of these services which may make it more difficult to participate in work related activities. The elimination of vacant positions will limit recruitment for positions that provide direct mental health outpatient services to clients, as well as Departmental administrative activities in tracking medical necessity, review of acute care utilization and claiming that could potentially affect revenue through documentation failures, the claiming of revenue from third party payors, and will reduce flexibility in responding to future workload increases. Increased Measure A revenue offset s ongoing appropriations in indigent health services provided by primary care community -based organizations with no service impacts. Use of Fiscal Management Reward Program savings will result in the loss of these funds for future one-time needs. HEALTH CA RE SERVICES FUNDING CONCERNS Consumers and providers will experience the brunt of the State's 2011 -12 budget reductions when Medi -Cal cost containment strategies go into effect in July, including limits on utilization, beneficiary cost sharing, and provide r rate reductions. Client share of cost in the Aids Drug Assistance Program will also increase to the maximum percentages allowable under federal law. The passage of AB100 redirected Prop 63 Mental Health Services Act revenue to now fund specialty mental health managed care, AB 3632 services for special education pupils and the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) program. This funding is for Fiscal Year 2011 - 2012. The chief concern is the reduction in base funding that will occ ur. EPSDT expansion will be curtailed, and additional service reductions may be necessary, the extent of which depends upon the final allocation formulas. The shift of parole and low -level offender responsibility from the State to the County under the Governor's proposed realignment of public safety programs in the State budget will impact the provision of health care services in the County, due to the high number of uninsured within the criminal justice system and the responsibility of the County to provi de indigent health care services. Compounding the problem, no additional funding for substance abuse treatment or mental health care has been provided under the realignment proposal for this population who are in greater need of these services than the general public. There are ongoing concerns about the federal budget impact on County health programs, including continued debate in Congress about the future of Medicare, and proposed reductions in several other safety net programs.

Specific outc omes include: More children living safely at home; More parents able to support their children economically, emotionally, and developmentally; and A service system that is better integrated, more family -focused and outcomes -driven. This effort has brought members of the Board of Supervisors, County department heads (Health Care, Social ALAMEDA COUNTY DEPARTMENT SUMMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES AGENCY - ADMINISTRATION 266 Services, Probation), education leaders, and community members together to develop pilot programs and policies to achieve these outcomes. A central principle is the develo pment of initiatives at both the high end of the system where the most costly services are provided and the front end of the system to develop and support integrated prevention and early intervention efforts. Goals: Lead and facilitate the development of a coordinated system of care to further develop and enhance the Sexually Exploited Minor/Commercially Sexually Exploited Children (SEM/CSEC) targeted services supported by the City of Oakland Measure Y and the Federal Office of Juvenile Justice Delinquency funding.

ALAMEDA COUNTY DEPARTMENT SUMMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES AGENCY - ADMINISTRATION 268 COURT APPOINTED SPEC IAL ADVOCATES (CASA) Alameda County Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) Program's mission is to recruit and support quality volunteer advocates to speak in the best interests of abused and neglected children in the Alameda County dependency court system. Throughout its history, CASA volunteers helped to meet the emotional and physical safety needs of thousands of abused and neglected children. Volunteers advocate on behalf of the children's educational, mental health, medical/dental, and family/sibling visitation needs, and work to increase the likelihood that children are placed in homes and with families in which they will thrive. In a sometimes bewildering sea of child welfare workers, attorneys, therapists and caregivers, the CASA volunteer is a consistent and caring adult and advocate for the child. The one - on-one relationship that forms between the volunteer and dependent child is often the only stable relationship the youth has while in foster care or group home. Goals: Enrich the quality of life for children in foster care. Increase the number of volunteers, particularl y the percentage of volunteers who are men and people of color. Increase the number of children served. Strengthen relationships with key stakeholders. Increase CASA's visibility. Enhance training opportunities for advocates and staff. Strengthen CASA 's infrastructure and financing to meet service needs, and to support and strengthen the program.

We envision communities where people realize their potential, and where stigma and discrimination against those with mental health, alcohol and/or drug issues are eliminated. Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (BHCS) values: Access, where every door is the right door for welcoming people with complex needs; c onsumer and family empowerment, through shared decision -making b est practices that produce effective outcomes; business excellence including cost - effective use of public resources; h ealth and w ellness, by integrating emotional, spiritual and physical health care; c ulturally appropriate services built o n the strengths and life experiences of culturally diverse consumers and their families; s ocial inclusion utilizing advocacy and education to eliminate stigma, discrimination, isolation, and misunderstanding of persons with mental illness and dealing with substance abuse. MANDATED SERVICES Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Services - The level of mandated services is determined by State and federal statute. Although local needs and priorities are given primary focus, various federal and State requirements exist regarding prevention activities, services for parolees and perinatal women, as well as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis services. Beyond those mandates, a full range of services is maintained, including residential, non -residential, prevention, driving under the influence, and drug diversion programs. Mental Health Services - The level and range of services recommended and the target population are prescribed by AB 1288 (the Bronzan- McCorquodale Mental Health Act). AB 1288 requires the County to fund mental heal th services for people with a serious, persistent mental illness (or children with serious ALAMEDA COUNTY DEPARTMENT SUMMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES AGENCY - BEHAVIORAL HEALTH 271emotional disturbances within specific funding guidelines). Mandated services include: psychiatric crisis or emergency treatment, inpatient care, outpatient/day treatment, case management, conservatorship, administration, and evaluation. Medi -Cal Consolidation - requires the Behavioral Health Care Services (BHCS) Department to provide the full range of mental health services to any Alameda County Medi-Cal beneficiary meeting Medi -Cal medical necessity criteria and in need of those services. Other Mandated Services - include mental health and substance abuse services to adult inmates in the County jails, and juvenile offenders in Juvenile Hall, as well as services to people with organic brain disease and traumatic brain injuries. DISCRETIONARY SERVIC ES County General Fund dollars over and above those required as a match for State and federal dollars are defined as discretionary. These dollars are used by BHCS to: Provide housing support for people who are homeless and who also have a mental illness and/or alcohol and/or other substance abuse disorder. Deliver mental health and substance abuse services based on local priorities designated by the Board of Supervisors such as: Children in group homes and out -of-home placements Consumer -run self -help and empowerment programs Vocational training An expanded continuum of alcohol and other drug services Serve clients who need intervention in life threatening crises but who would be ineligible for services through the State Department of Mental Health mandated (and funded) target population definitions.

Service Impacts The closure of Lincoln Child Center residential placement facility will have no service impact as the children will receive the same level of services at alternative placements. The reduction in the Telecare contract for training services will reduce the availability of training fo r staff that would ensure clinicians delivering services to clients remain effective, knowledgeable, and able to deliver culturally relevant services to a diverse population; however, this line item in Telecare's budget has been traditionally underspent. The loss of State funding for the Bay Area Services Network (BASN) will impact the agencies in the network providing outpatient substance use disorder services and result in reduced services. ALAMEDA COUNTY DEPARTMENT SUMMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES AGENCY - BEHAVIORAL HEALTH 275 Loss of State funding for California Work Opportunity & Responsibility to Kids (CalWORK s) mental health services contracts will deprive clients of these services , which may make it more difficult to participate in work related activities . The elimination of ten vacant positions will limit recruitment for positions that provide direct mental health outpatient services to clients, as well as Departmental administrative activities in tracking medical necessity, review of acute care utilization and claiming that could potentially affect revenue through documentation failures, and the claiming of revenue from third party payors. Use of Fiscal Management Reward Program savings will result in the loss of these funds for future one-time needs.

State -imposed changes to CalWORKs and In -Home Supportive Se rvices allocations and requirements reduced appropriations by $33.3 million, but also reduced revenues by $28.5 million, resulting in a net cost savings for the Social Services Agency of $4.8 million. These State cuts reduce recipient aid payments, servic e provider reimbursement rates, and overall service levels. Other reductions of $11.6 million in appropriations and increases in revenue of $1.8 million result in an additional $13.4 million in savings. These reductions include elimination of 60 vacant positions and other staffing changes, facilities consolidations, and caseload adjustments. Reinvestments of the Title IV- E Waiver, a source of federal funding to support child welfare services, and State Supplemental Security and Disability Income re imburs ement funds are expected to significantly enhance client outcomes by emphasizing family support and reunification in foster care programs and moving eligible aid recipients on to more stable income. Additionally, $15 million in Fiscal Management Reward program savings contributes to the Public Assistance program area cost savings.

ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGRAM SUMMARY PUBLIC ASSISTANCE 307 Service Impacts Changes in caseload estimates do not impact services, but reflect revised estimates of service need. State reductions in the CalWORKs program reduce County cost but significantly impact families through grant reductions, time limits, and changed eligibility criteria. State changes to the In -Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program further restrict eligibility. Transfer of eligible program expenditures to Title IV- E Waiver funding allows program flexibility and maintenance in foster care. Increased investment in Supplemental Security Income advocacy will enhance General Assistance client outcomes by moving them to a more stable income source. State will retain the County share of child support collections representing reimbursement for aid paid , resulting in a loss of these funds for Children and Family services programs. Changes in employment services programs shift focus to employment support versus program compliance activities. Increased SB 90 mandate reimbursement revenues help to main tain the continuity of services. Elimination of vacant funded positions maintains existing services but may impact ongoing service levels as caseloads increase. Internal cost reduction efforts, miscellaneous revenue and appropriation adjustments, and reduc tions in Discretionary Services and Supplies maintain existing services and increase efficiencies. Use of Fiscal Management Reward Program savings will result in the loss of these funds for future one-time needs. FINAL BUDGET ADJUSTM ENTS Final Budget adjustments in the Public Assistance include: Final Funding Adjustments Appropriation Revenue Net County Cost Inc/(Dec) 2011- 12 Proposed Budget 644,411,039 565,557,682 positions 0 0 0 0.17 Miscell aneous adjustments in Veterans and Aging Services programs 578,492 578,492 0 1.00 Subtotal Final Changes 644,989,531 PUBLIC ASSISTANCE FU NDING CONCERNS The Gover nor's proposed realignment of public assistance programs from the State to the County is a chief concern. The County supports a constitutional amendment to guarantee adequate funding and a stable revenue stream to pay for realigned programs. The i mpact on clients of approved State cuts is less burdensome due to some last -minute add backs , but most of the grant reductions, time limits and eligibility restrictions remain in place. ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGRAM SUMMARY PUBLIC ASSISTANCE 308 If the adopted State budget revenues do not materialize, the \"trigger cuts\" will further decimate the \"safety net\" service pool through reductions in the number of providers and services as well as further eligibility restrictions. MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENT S IN 2010- 11 INCLUDE: DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES Implemented two -tiered customer service Call Center to resolve 90% and refer 10% of our calls, reduced average wait time per call, decreased rate of abandoned calls, reduced number of deflected calls, and increased call capacity, thereby improving customer service. By utilizing different classifications and staff configurations, reduced average cost per call from $29.96 the first 8 months of 2010 to a projected $14.15 per call by May 2011. Improved information technology by: a) partnering with the County's Information Technol ogy Department to consolidate services, eliminating duplication of effort; b) creating a \"productivity dashboard,\" a centralized tool to measure productivity; c) creating the \"report management system\" (RMS), centralizing information from the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) automated system's performance reports; d) implementing a \"case management tool\" (CMT) to assist caseworkers in managing and prioritizing caseloads. Completed an office -wide restructure by aligning team functions to mirror Statewide CSE, resulting in a more efficient, cost -effective way of doing business. Reviewed, consolidated, and updated Policies and Procedures into the SharePoint electronic document platform available to staff. Identified 24 efficiency actions to reduce County costs and completed 20. Collected $30,217,448 in child support from October 2010 through February 2011, projecting to collect a total of $78,774,700 by September 30, 2011 (Federal Fiscal Year). This is a 1% increase over last year's collections. SOCIAL SERV ICES ADULT AND AGING SERVICES Brought Adult Protective Services (APS) into programmatic compliance with State mandates for opening cases within APS jurisdiction. Implemen ted a web -based case management database for Adult Protective Services intake, case entry, and management. Increased outreach and visibility of the Veterans Service Office by collaborating with the City of Fremont and community -based organizations (CBOs) at an event where veterans received health screenings and access to benefits. Expanded services to include an office at the Livermore Veterans Administration hospital. Successfully reduced the \"Residual\" caseload from 740 cases to 360, thereby reducing coun ty costs by $607,950. ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGRAM SUMMARY PUBLIC ASSISTANCE 309 In partnership with Information Systems Department (ISD), completed the design of an online timekeeping program to automate and streamline payroll and provide improved access for In -Home Supportive Services (IHSS) Chore Providers. Wor ked with the Advisory Commission on Aging to provide health screenings to more than 800 seniors at the Healthy Aging Fair. Developed a partnership with a CBO to provide Family Caregiver Support Services to Ethiopian community members. Increased the number of certified Ombudsmen to respond to abuse allegations at long -term care facilities. First full year of operating an in -house provider registry, which saves over $150,000 annually. Collaborated with partners under National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) grant to develop a Safety in the Home handbook for IHSS consumers and providers. Managed sale of conservatee personal property consisting of motor vehicles, firearms/weapons, jewelry/coins/stamps/silver, and household furnishings with t otal revenue to conservatee trust accounts of $80,000. SOCIAL SERVICES CHIL DREN AND FAMILY SERV ICES Reduced the number of youths who enter foster care and out -of-home placement to just under 1600 youths by offering prevention and early intervention services. As a result of participating in the Title IV -E Waiver, the Department is offering child care subsidies for County licensed foster parents, teen parents, and relative caregivers. The Department provides this child care funding in an effort to recruit and retain caregivers who are employed or in school. Also as a result of the Waiver, Children and Family Services began planning, conducted a Request - For-Proposal process, and opened a Family Center, a family -friendly visitation center to provide therapeutic and supervised visitation in an effort to increase reunification. The Department also hired additional Child Welfare Workers in the family finding and engageme nt program. These Child Welfare Workers act as secondary workers to connect foster youth to their relatives in the hopes of finding a permanent, lasting relationship with a caring adult for all youth in care. Supported legislation to increase Independent Living Skills Program (ILSP) eligibility. Youth who are living in the home of a guardian that was established after the age of 8 are now eligible to attend ILSP. Before this legislation passed, these youth were unable to attend ILSP and receive the many services and bonus incentives that ILSP eligible youth receive. SOCIAL SERVICES ECON OMIC BENEFITS Increased participation in health fairs from 15 in 2009 to 26 in 2010. The Department partnered with Housing Resource Centers to offer homeless assistance services or funds for low -income families (those below 200% federal poverty level). Alameda County was one of six counties to go live with Benefits California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids Information Network (Benefits CalWIN) in May 2010 for CalFresh and Medi-Cal. Benefits CalWIN allows applicants for those programs to apply for assistance online from any remote location. ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGRAM SUMMARY PUBLIC ASSISTANCE 310 SOCIAL SERVICES EMPL OYMENT S ERVICES The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 created a new Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) Emergency Contingency Fund (ECF), which allowed the Employment Services Department to implement a successful subsidized employment program, ACHIRE, which achieved the following outcomes: 1,236 low -income Alameda County residents were employed at an average wage of $17.49 per hour. 210 CalWORKs recipients who lacked work experience were employed at an average wage of $8.00 per hour. 1,394 youth were employed in a summer youth employment program at an average wage of $8.02 per hour. The total amount of reimbursed wages and employment taxes paid to employers was $12,689,443. In calendar year 2010, a total of $2,823,887 in federal reimbursement were received as a result of 1,005 persons receiving Supplemental Security Income/State Supplemental Payments (SSI /SSP) and leaving the General Assistance caseloads.

Service Impacts Changes in caseload estimates do not impact services, but reflect revised estimates of service need. State red uctions in the CalWORKs program reduce County cost, but signi ficantly impact families through grant reductions, time limits, and changed eligibility criteria. State changes to the In -Home Supportive Services program further restrict eligibility. Transfer o f eligible program expenditures to Title IV- E Waiver funding allows program flexibility and maintenance in foster care. Elimination of vacant funded positions maintains existing services , but may impact ongoing service levels if caseloads increase. Increas ed investment in Supplemental Security Income advocacy will enhance General Assistance client outcomes by moving them to a more stable income source. State will retain the County share of child support collections which represent reimbursement for aid paid, resulting in a loss of these funds for Children and Family Services programs. Changes in emp loyment services programs shift focus to employment support versus program compliance activities. Increased SB 90 mandate reimbursement revenues help to maintain the continuity of services. Internal cost reduction efforts, miscellaneous revenue and appropriation adjustments, and reductions in Discretionary Services and Supplies maintain existing services and increase efficiencies. Use of Fiscal Management Reward Program savings will result in the loss of these funds for future one-time needs.

These savings include $8.4 million in appropriation reductions, which include staffing cost savings affecting 32 positions, 24 of which are being eliminated and eight being shifted to other funding sources. Staffing changes will reduce flexibility and may impact othe r Sheriff's services and reduce a variety of training and administrative services. Other cost savings include contract reductions for inmate health and food services, which may impact the amount of time needed to provide adult inmate services at both County jails, including medical, food, clothing, and transportation. In addition, services provided to youth at the Juvenile Justic e Center, including investigative activities and juvenile supervision, may be affected. Increased revenue of $19.1 million is largely achieved through increasing Proposition 172 public safety sales tax estimates and federal Title IVE waiver funding in the Probation Department for youth services, as well as other State an d federal reimbursement mechanisms. Additionally, $8.4 million in Fiscal Management Reward program savings contributes to the Public Protection program areas cost savings.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY Reduction in vacant positi ons maintains existing services bu t may impact ongoing service levels. PROBATION DEPARTMENT Use of Title IV-E waiver funds provides continuity of funding for probation programs. In adult services and juvenile services, the miscellaneous expenditure reductions and phase out of positions may limit program support services. In juvenile services, the elimination of 1.0 vacant Deputy Probation Officer position will reduce the department's capacity to investigate and supervise juvenile defendants or wards of the court. In juvenile institutions, the elimination of 1.0 vacant Institutional Supervisor position will reduce the department's capacity to supervise juvenile probatio ners at the Juvenile Justice Center. The food service contract will be discontinued and replaced with inhouse food services with no reduction in service level. PUBLIC DEFENDER Elimination of vacant positions may impact future support and legal service capacity. SHERIFF'S OFFICE Elimination of vacant positions and staffing changes may increase the amount of time needed to provide inmate services including medical, food and clothing, and transportation, as well as reduce staffing available to timely process payroll and other financial transactions. Reduced Discretionary Services and Supplies will curtail staff training and impact administrative services provided at the Regional Traini n g Center, Crime Lab, and Office of Emergency Services. ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGRAM SUMMAR Y PUBLIC PROTECTION 381 PUBLIC PROTECTION FUNDING CONCERNS Escalating retirement costs are a major contributor to the increased Maintenance of Effort budget for public protection departments. To address this issue, the County sponsored AB 1667, which was adopted by the State of California on July 15, 2010. This legislation authorized the County to provide new retirement formulas for new members of safety barga ining units. The Governor's proposed realignment of public safety programs, including the shift of parole and lowlevel offender responsibility from the State to the County, is a chief concern. The County supports a constitutional amendment to guarantee adequate funding and a stable revenue stream to pay for realigne d programs. Additionally, large urban counties may experience a disproportionate impact from this realignment. As such, the County is advocating for additional funding for neighborhood initiatives and local reentry programs to mitigate the impacts.

These include felonies (those crimes that carry a potential State prison sentence) and misdemeanors (those that carry a potential County jail sentence). The DA is also responsible for Consumer Fraud, Environmental Protection, Insurance Fraud, Worker Protection and Public Assistance Fraud. Within Criminal Prosecution, the District Attorney's Office has created several specialized units that handle the most sensitive, co mplicated, and unique cases involving vulnerable victims. The Child Sexual Assault Unit handles a majority of the sexual assault crimes committed against children under the age of 18. The Human Exploitation and Trafficking (H.E.A.T.) Unit is the statewide leader in addressing commercial, sexual exploitation of minors with a five point blueprint for combating human trafficking and supporting these child victims of sexual exploitation. The Gang Unit works closely with law enforcement and prosecutes legally and factually complicated crimes committed by gangs. The Narcotics Unit investigates and prosecutes the most complicated, high -level narcotics cases. The High Tech/Identity Theft Unit prosecutes computer and identity theft crimes. The Elder Abuse Unit h andles crimes of abuse, neglect, and financial fraud committed against elders and dependent adults. Alameda County has the first and only Elder Abuse Court which handles identified Elder Abuse cases in a timely, expedited manner. All cases are handled ve rtically by District Attorneys who are specialists in Elder Abuse. The Domestic Violence Unit prosecutes crimes of inter- familial violence which often involve relocation of the victim and children for their safety. The Stalking Unit prosecutes criminal activity of a stalking nature, including repeated, unwarranted, and threatening contact by the stalker. Further, the Stalking Unit Investigators and Victim -Witness Advocate provide safety planning for victims of domestic violence and stalking, and provide threat management support for victims of stalking. The Restitution Unit identifies financial loss as a result of a crime so the court can order the convicted defendant to pay restitution to the victim and/or the State of California. The Restitution Unit is a model for the State of California and all counties. The Truancy Unit has worked closely with the Alameda County Board of Education and the County's school districts with particular emphasis on Oakland. The Unit works in collaboration with the school s to identify chronically truant children and provide intervention, assessment, and planning necessary to get them back in school. These interventions include parent/guardian court involvement.

The DNA Cold Case Unit has been created to work closely with law enforcement on the investigation and prosecution of previously unsolved violent crimes where the identity of the perpetrator is established through DNA or other advances in forensic sciences. The Unit consists of an investigator and two full -time prosecutors who work with law enforcement and vertically prosecute cases that are charged. All victims receive Victim -Witness Assistance support. VICTIM -WITNESS DIVISION The District Attorney has a Victim -Witness Division which has multiple functions. The Victim -Witness Division provides psycho -social support as well as court accompaniment services for victims and witnesses of crime s.
