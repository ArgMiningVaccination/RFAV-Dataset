This year, mental health drove the public agenda, and CAMH experts made an impact where it mattered most. We were at the table and on the ground addressing issues such as the police response to people in crisis; the tragedy of Aboriginal youth suicides; the epidemic of deaths from fentanyl overdoses; concerns about PTSD in Syrian refugees, veterans and first responders; and the ethics of medically assisted death. As Canada's largest academic health science centre dedicated to mental health, CAMH cares for over 30,000 patients a year, including those with the most serious and complex mental illness. This year, our clinicians introduced new evidence-based treatment plans to standardize and improve care across a range of conditions. Along with our partners in the Medical Psychiatry Alliance, we're committed to the best physical and mental health care for our patients, and we're delivering it through our Brain-Heart Service. The Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute brings the latest brain research techniques together with experts in genetics, epigenetics and brain imaging. Our scientists are translating breakthroughs in the lab into options for patient care. CAMH researchers are creating excitement and optimism for discovering the biologic mechanisms of mental illness. We're sharing our knowledge broadly. This year, CAMH opened our Simulation Centre and launched ECHO Ontario Mental Health, a virtual community of practice that provides rural primary care clinicians with real-time video case consultation from mental health experts at CAMH. Private philanthropy plays an important role in our work. The Cundill Centre for Child and Youth Depression \u2014 the first global centre dedicated to youth depression \u2014 was made possible through a $15-million gift from The Peter Cundill Foundation. Our community's philanthropic leaders are vital to our future. Support from our $200-million Breakthrough Campaign will help us build the hospital of tomorrow. Our patients will receive care in warm, welcoming spaces, as we improve care models and treatment to change the future for people with mental illness. We're proud of our 2015/16 achievements, and anticipate a new year filled with the next breakthroughs in mental health.C From left, Dr. Catherine Zahn, Darrell Louise Gregersen, Tom Milroy, Kelly E.D.

The Cundill Centre for Child and Youth Depression will help young people reach their true potential. \"Peter Cundill was passionate about supporting children. Through the Cundill Centre for Child and Youth Depression at CAMH, Peter will continue to help young people around the world live healthier, more productive lives. \" - David Feather \"The medical field has been slow to recognize that depression can develop in children as young as five,\" says Dr. Peter Szatmari, Chief of CAMH's Child, Youth and Family Program and acting Director of the Cundill Centre. \"This Centre will help mobilize an international network of experts and focus efforts on developing better care for this vulnerable population.\" CAMH is a global leader in child and youth mental health. Our experts are collaborating nationally and internationally. With its official launch in May 2015, CAMH's Margaret and Wallace McCain Centre for Child, Youth & Family Mental Health has a number of exciting projects underway, including three one-stop mental health care service centres for youth and their families. \"There is a real energy and excitement in our team about making a difference in the lives of kids and teens and their families, both here at CAMH and in partnership with mental health services throughout Canada,\" says Dr. Joanna Henderson, Director of the McCain Centre. At the Slaight Family Centre for Youth in Transition, CAMH is developing the tools young people with earlypsychosis or schizophrenia need for life beyond our walls, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is being tested for the first time in patients 16 to 24. Established in 2012, The Peter Cundill Foundation honours the legacy of renowned Canadian investor and philanthropist, F. Peter Cundill (1938-2011). The Foundation has an emphasis on promoting the health, education and well-being of young people.New hope for young people David Feather, Vice-Chair of The Peter Cundill Foundation.AT CAMH WE CARE CCARE The promise of a future when everyone will believe life is worth living Dr. Faranak Farzan, a scientist with the Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention, leads a pioneering brain stimulation study focused on young people, with Fahad Alvi.

Located at CAMH, the New Beginnings Clinic \u2014 a partnership with Women's College Hospital's Crossroads Clinic \u2014 gives refugees the culturally sensitive care they need and connects primary care providers with psychiatrists and social workers. \"Refugees need opportunities and a sense of hope based on community support,\" says Dr. Branka Agic, CAMH's Health Equity Manager and a key player in CAMH refugee initiatives. \"In turn, refugees have tremendous capacity to enrich our society.\" The clinic is CAMH's latest initiative in ongoing local, national and global efforts in refugee mental health. This year, the Refugee Mental Health Project trained over 1,200 Ontario service providers to better support refugees. Funded by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, the project is part of CAMH's Health Equity Department led by Dr. Kwame McKenzie.Drs. McKenzie and Agic also lead a Mental Health Commission of Canada project, a joint initiative with the Wellesley Institute, to improve mental health care for immigrants, refugees, ethno-cultural and racialized groups. As well, CAMH is partnering with the Canadian Centre for Victims of Torture, George Brown College and the Wellesley Institute to develop a program to improve access to higher education for refugees. \"In turn, refugees have tremendous capacity to enrich our society. \" - Dr. Branka Agic The urge to help has spread throughout CAMH. In February, employees and Board members reached their goal of raising $45,000 to sponsor a Syrian family. The New Beginnings Campaign was initiated by CAMH Board Chair Kelly Meighen. \"We know the CAMH community has a strong sense of social justice, a need to be involved, and a strategic goal to drive social change,\" says Kelly. CNew beginnings Listening, learning and leadingAT CAMH WE CARE CARE AMH is working closely with Aboriginal communities across the province to help reach the important mental health goals set out by Canada's historic Truth and Reconciliation Commission report. Over the past 18 months, CAMH has engaged Aboriginal leaders, organizations, service providers and communities as well as Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal staff at CAMH to develop Guiding Directions: A plan to strengthen our practices and partnerships with First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples. \"We have so many Aboriginal communities that are truly in crisis,\" says Dr. Renee Linklater, Director of CAMH's Aboriginal Engagement and Outreach. \"Engagement with these communities is such an important piece of our work \u2014 just meeting with and listening to people to find out how we can better support them in the mental health issues they're facing.\" Dr. Linklater is leading efforts to provide better mental health and addiction training in remote Aboriginal communities through a project funded by the Ministry of Child and Youth Services. The CAMH team has already provided training and implementation support to more than 600 workers in Northern communities.\"It is really critical for us to work with elders and experts in these communities to provide access to training that is culturally appropriate in or near their home communities,\" Dr. Linklater explains. \"In Northern Ontario, these opportunities are few and far between.\" \"We have so many Aboriginal communities that are truly in crisis. \" - Dr. Renee Linklater In March, CAMH's Aboriginal Service and the TeleMental Health Services received a transformational $1-million gift from the Geoffrey H. Wood Foundation. This support enables CAMH to open a hospital-based sweat lodge; expand our outreach to include a focus on Aboriginal communities; and adapt a successful cognitive behaviour therapy model to be culturally appropriate for use with Aboriginal populations. \"Support from the Geoffrey H. Wood Foundation provides us with opportunities to develop programs and expand services to Aboriginal populations across the province,\" says Dr. Linklater. \"These communities are so under-resourced and this gift will certainly support much-needed services.\"C Dr. Branka Agic, CAMH's Health Equity Manager.

Integrated Care Pathways or ICPs are new to mental health and they are already producing better outcomes. \"It was a long journey, but I'm convinced my mother would no longer be with us had she not been admitted to CAMH to experience the wonderful care there,\" says Linda Krisman. At 84, her mother Yolanda was struggling with dementia. She was disoriented, forgetful and experiencing paranoia; weak from significant weight loss, she could no longer look after herself. Using the new Dementia: Management of Agitation and Aggression ICP, care providers from multiple disciplines tailored a structured treatment plan to meet Yolanda's needs. \"This approach is very humane, and really brings down the barriers between the community and the hospital,\" Linda says. \"It was very holistic; everyone had the same mission, and that alignment was very impressive.\" The Dementia pathway is indeed changing the way patients receive care. For example, while 50 per cent of similar patients are treated with two or more medications for neuropsychiatric symptoms in long-term care homes, the CAMH approach has been able to improve patients' lives with one medication or even without medication. In addition, patients enrolled in CAMH's ICP have 40 per cent fewer falls. \"In the past few years, the number of new patients assessed in the memory clinic has increased by 500 per cent. And still, we can see patients within less than two weeks,\" says Dr. Tarek Rajji, CAMH's Chief of Geriatric Psychiatry. More than 1,000 people have benefitted from CAMH's ICP approach, including the Alcohol Use Disorder ICP created through generous support from Lori McBurney. Several ICPs are being rolled out in settings across the province.CAT CAMH WE CARE Helping more people recover, fasterCare for the most vulnerable Expanding CAMH's reach Volunteer Coordinators Michael Koly and Danielle Trost at the Toronto South Detention Centre. Simple pleasures Through a $1,000 grant from the CAMH Gifts of Light Comfort Fund, a library at the Toronto South Detention Centre is improving moods and helping patients recover through the simple pleasures of a good book. \"Reading is one thing our patients have control over, and literature can be such a powerful means of escape,\" says Katy Konyk, a social worker with FEIS. The library is just one of many projects made possible through the Comfort Fund. Created through the vision of an anonymous donor, the fund provides grants of up to $5,000 each to support small but meaningful projects not funded by the hospital's operating or capital budgets. Since it launched in 2013, 313 applications have been received and $294,165 has been granted to projects to improve outcomes for patients.

Inmates with mental illness have an urgent need for quality mental health care. That is their right. The Forensic Early Intervention Service (FEIS) is one way CAMH is meeting the mental health needs of this vulnerable population. \"We act flexibly in every effort to support these clients, enhancing the possibility of success once they are back in the community. \" - Dr. Kiran Patel Located at the Toronto South Detention Centre, FEIS is a partnership between CAMH, the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services and the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. Since launching in January 2015, the service has received over 1,200 referrals and provided mental health screening, triage, and interventions to 712 inmates. \"Correctional services staff have commented that their clients are engaging well with FEIS, noting an improvement in clients' overall mood, including mental status and ability to manage their behaviours and engage with others,\" says Jim McNamee, Executive Director of the Complex Mental Illness Program at CAMH. CAMH's Dr. Kiran Patel, Forensic Psychiatrist, credits FEIS' success to the interdisciplinary team of psychiatrists, psychologists, occupational therapists, nurses, and social workers who work in innovative ways to help a vulnerable, stigmatized and disenfranchised population. \"We act flexibly in every effort to support these clients, enhancing the possibility of success once they are back in the community,\" says Dr. Patel. FEIS will expand to Milton's Vanier Centre for Women in the fall. With an estimated 44 per cent of inmates in Ontario self-reporting a mental health or addiction issue, it's hoped that FEIS, the only program of its kind in Ontario, will become a blueprint for many future programs. M10 11 CAMH & CAMH Foundation 2015/16 Annual Report CAMH & CAMH Foundation 2015/16 Annual Report DISCOVER AT CAMH WE DISCOVER Translating research into better care Discovering the causes of mental illness r. Romina Mizrahi is working toward the day when she can predict who will develop schizophrenia so she can prevent the disease completely. Dr. Mizrahi, a Clinician-Scientist with CAMH's Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, is part of a global team of researchers zeroing in on the precise biological factors that could make this happen. \"Working together is the only way we can make fast progress in understanding the development of this illness, and prevent it from occurring in this high-risk group,\" says Dr. Mizrahi, who heads CAMH's Focus on Youth Psychosis Prevention Clinic and Research Program. Her work is supported in part by the Meighen Family Directorate for High-Risk Youth. Studies suggest people from this high-risk group are among the highest cost users of the mental health system. Dr. Claire de Oliveira, a Scientist and Health Economist in the Institute for Mental Health Policy Research at CAMH, is one of the first researchers in Canada to look at heavy users of mental health care whose needs are complex. She has found they differ substantially from heavy users of physical health care. She's now developing models to identify mental health care users at the highest risk of future hospitalization. \"If we can identify individuals at risk, this may present an opportunity to provide earlier preventive health care and social services, such as high-support housing units,\" she says. \"Working together is the only way we can make fast progress in understanding the development of this illness, and prevent it from occurring in this high-risk group. \" - Dr. Romina MizrahiResearch by Dr. Lana Popova, a Senior Scientist in CAMH's Institute for Mental Health Policy Research, is furthering our understanding of the harms associated with drinking during pregnancy. Her recent study identified 428 distinct disease conditions co-occuring with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) \u2014 conditions that affect nearly every system of the body, including the brain, vision, hearing, cardiac, circulation, digestion, and musculoskeletal and respiratory systems. \"Improving the screening and diagnosis of FASD has numerous benefits that may prevent or reduce secondary outcomes that can occur among those with FASD, such as problems with relationships, schooling, employment, or with the law,\" says Dr. Popova. \"It is important that the public receive a consistent and clear message \u2014 if you want to have a healthy child, stay away from alcohol when you're planning a pregnancy and throughout your whole pregnancy.\"D Clinical-Scientist Dr. Romina Mizrahi's work is focused on preventing schizophrenia in young people.

This is a new frontier in mental health research, and it's helping researchers understand the molecular mechanisms behind psychiatric illnesses. \"We are mining data, understanding it and learning lessons from it,\" says Dr. Etienne Sibille, the inaugural holder of CAMH's Campbell Family Chair in Clinical Neuroscience. Working with researchers in the U.S., Dr. Sibille used the power of big data to analyze thousands of genes from nearly 150 brains to determine that aging results in changes to day-night rhythms that could explain the changes in sleep patterns, cognition and mood seen in aging. \"We are mining data, understanding it and learning lessons from it. \" - Dr. Etienne Sibille Big data is also key to an international research project focusing on the most challenging aspects of schizophrenia. The study is led by Dr. Aristotle Voineskos, head of the Kimel Family Translational Imaging-Genetics Laboratory. The ambitious fi ve-year study combines brain scans and genetic information to identify and map genes associated with social impairments in schizophrenia. \"There are many millions of variables on each person,\" says Dr. Voineskos, noting that bioinformatics will allow his team to extract meaning from large datasets faster than has ever been possible before.C New approach to depression CAMH will advance a new approach effective in treating depression through a new licensing agreement. A peptide developed by Dr. Fang Liu and her team shows promise in treating depression and other disorders, and is delivered through a nasal spray developed by Impel NeuroPharma. The agreement enables further research as the treatment is developed. \"This peptide is an entirely new approach to treating depression, and our work with Impel NeuroPharma has demonstrated a safe and effective way to provide this treatment in our research to date,\" says Dr. Liu, Head of Molecular Neuroscience in the Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute. \"We're excited that this licensing agreement brings us one step closer to clinical trials.\"Dr. Fang Liu, Head of Molecular Neuroscience.Photo credit: Roger Yipp14 15 CAMH & CAMH & CAMH Foundation 2015/16 Annual ReportBreakthough Our brain imaging research shows people with Alzheimer's have higher levels of brain inflammation. This discovery could lead to new treatment approaches.Understanding the cause CAMH's Campbell Institute is combining both genetics and brain imaging to pinpoint cellular and structural changes that lead to dementia. DISCOVER A safe place to sleep Translating evidence into action Dr. Alex Abramovich, Independent Scientist in CAMH's Institute for Mental Health Policy Research. omeless LGBTQ youth finally have a safe place to sleep at night, thanks in part to CAMH's Dr. Alex Abramovich, an Independent Scientist in CAMH's Institute for Mental Health Policy Research. YMCA Sprott House, Canada's first transitional housing for LGBTQ youth, will provide a safe and supportive environment for up to a year for 25 youth who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer between the ages of 16 and 24. \"I have never felt more proud of our city than I do this morning,\" Dr. Abramovich said at the shelter's opening in February, flanked by Toronto Mayor John Tory and Councillor Joe Cressy. Through more than a decade of research, Dr. Abramovich demonstrated that, while LGBTQ youth account for up to 40 per cent of homeless youth and are particularly vulnerable to mental illness and substance use, their needs weren't met being met in traditional shelters. His work convinced the City of Toronto to update its shelter standards last fall, and mandatory LGBTQ training for front-line staff in youth shelters began in February. Dr. Abram ovich will evaluate the shelter's impact on the lives of LGBTQ youth to build evidence that will inform the development of future LGBTQ housing services across Canada. \"With all my heart, I hope this is the beginning of a major shift in how we deal with youth homelessness. \" - Dr. Alex Abramovich Dr. Abramovich's research and advocacy work is an important part of CAMH's wider efforts toward improving health for LGBTQ youth and adults. In March, CAMH welcomed the province's decision to expand access to referrals for sex-reassignment surgery in Ontario.HAT CAMH WE DISCOVER The aging brain CAMH's Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute Our progress in identifying risks and improving treatment: CAMH is the leading Canadian centre for innovative care, education and research on mental illness and aging. People who are depressed in late life are up to four times more likely to develop dementia. 75 per cent of seniors living in long-term care homes suffer from psychiatric symptoms related to dementia. Delaying Alzheimer's disease onset by two years could save the health-care system $15 billion.Improving treatment Researchers are studying how age affects the metabolization of drugs. This work will protect seniors and reduce health-care costs. Prevention CAMH's Campbell Institute is leading Canada's largest Alzheimer's disease prevention study. The study combines cognitive exercises with brain stimulation therapy. Improving care for older adults Canadians are living longer than ever, but we know very little about the aging brain or how age affects treatment for mental illness. Dr. Bruce Pollock, Vice-President of Research and Director of the Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, is internationally renowned for his research in geriatric mental health, with a focus on improving therapeutic care for depression and dementia in late life. His research \u2014 along with that of Campbell Institute scientists \u2014 will lead to a better understanding of how age affects the brain and how we can prevent and better treat age-related illnesses like Alzheimer's disease. 16 17 CAMH & CAMH Foundation 2015/16 Annual Report CAMH & CAMH Foundation 2015/16 Annual ReportSound body and mind No health without mental health C From left, CAMH Vice-President of Education Dr. Ivan Silver watches Dr. Catherine Zahn officially open the Simulation Centre while Dr. Trevor Young, Dean of the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine, and Dr. Benoit Mulsant, Executive Director of the Medical Psychiatry Alliance, look on.LEARN AT CAMH WE LEARN AMH is improving health for both the body and mind through two exciting new Medical Psychiatry Alliance initiatives: the CAMH Brain-Heart Service and CAMH's Simulation Centre. People with mental illness have a life expectancy up to 15 years shorter than those without because their medical illnesses too often slip through cracks in the system. The Medical Psychiatry Alliance is a partnership with SickKids, Trillium Health Partners and the University of Toronto, in conjunction with the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care and a generous donor. \"There is plenty of overlap between mental and physical illness, and we can greatly improve health across the board if we simply get better at managing physical and mental illness at the same time,\" explains Dr. Valerie Taylor, lead for the CAMH Brain-Heart Service. \"Looking at it purely from a health systems perspective, the top one per cent of physical health resource users are twice as likely to have a psychiatric diagnosis.\" Through the CAMH Brain-Heart Service, physical illnesses will be better identified and managed in people with mental illness. With help managing weight and related metabolic issues, patients will be more likely to stick to their psychiatric care plans. Dr. Taylor launched a series of Obesity Management Training workshops in April aimed at guiding health practitioners in obesity counseling and management. Further workshops are planned at Trillium Health Partners and SickKids. \"There is plenty of overlap between mental and physical illness, and we can greatly improve health across the board if we simply get better at managing physical and mental illness at the same time. \" - Dr. Valerie Taylor \"We don't expect psychiatrists to treat diabetes or manage cardiovascular disease, but we can make them feel comfortable in recognizing when another health care professional needs to get involved,\" says Dr. Taylor. \"That will have a significant impact on patients.\"In November 2015, the Medical Psychiatry Alliance celebrated the launch of CAMH's Simulation Centre. This new education hub provides a safe learning environment for students, trainees and health professionals in which to practice caring for people with combined physical and mental illness. While simulation training is well-established in health specialties such as surgery and anesthesiology, CAMH's centre is the first in Canada to offer a focus on mental health care. \"There's not enough opportunity to rehearse aspects of learning before you actually confront it with your patients,\" says Dr. Ivan Silver, Vice President, CAMH Education. \"It's a missing ingredient in mental health \u2014 we do a lot of learning on the job, but we need better ways to prepare clinicians before they actually need to use a skill in practice.\"18 19 CAMH & CAMH Foundation 2015/16 Annual Report CAMH & CAMH Foundation 2015/16 Annual ReportOnline gateway to mental health Sharing our knowledge with the world From left: Nancy McNaughton, Senior Simulation Specialist, CAMH; Dr. David Goldbloom, Senior Medical Advisor, CAMH; Mary Deacon, Chair, Bell Let's Talk; Amy Restoule, Social Worker, Sudbury East Community Health Centre; Dr. Catherine Zahn, President and CEO, CAMH; Ann Douglas, Author, Patient, Family Member and Member of Portico's National Advisory Board ; and Dr. Peter Selby, Director of Medical Education at CAMH.s demand for specialized mental health services continues to outstrip supply, CAMH is helping close the gap. We are providing practical and effective ways to better equip primary care professionals to treat mental illness in their daily practice, and patients and families to find the support they need. Through ECHO Ontario Mental Health at CAMH and University of Toronto, CAMH is virtually connecting rural and remote primary care sites across the province with Toronto-based mental health and addiction specialists. Using teleconferencing technology, mental health experts and frontline care providers discuss patients and learn new subject matter on a weekly basis.\"This is a really exciting project, with the opportunity for every health care provider at the table to learn together, which will translate into best practices that can help patients,\" says Dr. Allison Crawford, who co-chairs the weekly, two-hour ECHO sessions. \"It's a very patient-centred approach \u2014 we're bringing the experts to one table and mapping out a treatment plan together.\" The ECHO model uses multi-point live video conferencing to connect mental health experts at the hub to multiple primary care providers in the regions, allowing for real-time case consultation and feedback. Through this multi-directional learning structure, ECHO provides primary care providers with knowledge and support to manage complex needs within their own practices. A\"Mental health is complicated, and primary care providers need help. That's where Portico and the new app for primary care practitioners come in. With the right tools, resources and expert support \u2014 delivered with the latest technology \u2014 primary care providers can help close the gap. \" - Dr. Catherine Zahn Based on a handbook co-edited by Dr. David Goldbloom, Senior Medical Advisor at CAMH, the Psychiatry in Primary Care app provides primary care providers with reliable assessment and intervention tools as they support Canadians with mental illness and addiction. Health care practitioners can run sessions with patients using assessments, screening tools and interview guides, or search more in-depth information on Portico. \"Most Canadians access health care exclusively through a primary care setting, be it a physician's office or a family health team,\" said Dr. Goldbloom. \"As demand for specialized mental health services continues to outstrip supply, we need practical and effective ways to better equip primary care professionals to treat mental illness in their daily practice.\" Created in partnership with Bell Canada, CAMH's online interactive Portico network connects health and community service providers to the latest clinical tools, resources and information.LEARN AT CAMH WE LEARN The Slaight Family Centre for Youth in Transition also continues to engage young people through My Thought Spot, a user-generated, crowd-sourced map of youth-focused mental health supports in the GTA. The project is made possible through a $750,000 grant from Canadian Institutes of Health Research and matching funds from project partners.20 21 CAMH & CAMH Foundation 2015/16 Annual CAMH Foundation 2015/16 Annual ReportBUILD AT CAMH WE BUILD Advancing public policy Driving social change AMH is driving social change and building a better mental health system for our patients, families and stakeholders. The issues vary from substance use to housing. Toronto Mayor John Tory hosted a round table at CAMH on how the police handle encounters with people in crisis, and CAMH will be continuing to recommend improvements, as we have with the OPP . With the recent rise in prescription opioid addiction and overdose deaths from fentanyl, particularly among young people, the federal government named CAMH as Ontario lead of the Canadian Research Initiative on Substance Misuse (CRISM), a national network aimed at identifying and implementing effective treatments for the more than 400,000 Canadians who misuse prescription drugs. It is estimated up to 80 per cent of people seeking addiction treatment have another mental illness diagnosis. In one of the largest clinical changes to Ontario's addiction system in more than two decades, CAMH is rolling out new screening and assessment tools that will result in more comprehensive treatment for those accessing addiction services funded by the province. The legalization of cannabis is on the public agenda. CAMH's Cannabis Policy Framework has been effective in making the case that, once legal, strict regulations on the drug are required from a public health perspective. CAMH is helping policy makers address the many emerging issues, from medical marijuana to preventing cannabis-impaired driving. Proposed legislation governing physician-assisted death has provoked a deeply emotional debate among Canadians: should medically assisted death ever be extended to include a person with mental illness? CAMH psychiatric, bioethical and legal experts contributed to the issue at the Special Joint Committee and Senate Committee hearings in Ottawa. C Mayor John Tory, Councilors James Pasternak and Kristyn Wong-Tam, and Dr. Catherine Zahn tour CAMH's Queen Street site and chat with Dakoda Bowen from CAMH's Out of This World Caf\u00e9. \"There's a lot being done and the dialogue surrounding mental illness is much more open than it was 10 years ago,\" says Mayor Tory. \"I have to give credit to institutions like CAMH, which is a world leader.\"AMH is helping build a better mental health system, provincially, nationally and globally. With offices throughout Ontario, CAMH's Provincial System Support Program works closely with local communities and key partners to support system change. So far, much of the work has focused on service coordination, individuals who are at risk or involved in the justice system, and youth transitioning to the adult mental health system. CAMH provides TeleMental Health Services in over 225 communities (and growing) across the province and works with Aboriginal communities throughout the north. CAMH works collaboratively with partners from coast to coast on national mental health research, education and treatment initiatives. Globally, CAMH is a World Health Organization/Pan- American Health Organization Collaborating Centre inAddiction and Mental Health. CAMH's Office of Transformative Global Health jointly develops, implements, and sustains collaborative education programs for clinicians and allied professionals in Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Africa.CBuilding a better mental health system CAMH Provincial System Support Program (PSSP) PSSP locations Supporting Transition Age YouthHelping Justice-Involved YouthCoordinating services across sectors Training Northern Aboriginal Mental Health Workers CAMH Clinical Outreach TeleMental Health Locations ECHO Ontario Mental Health (CAMH and U of T) Northern Psychiatric Outreach Program at CAMH (NPOP-C) 22 23 CAMH & CAMH Foundation & CAMH Foundation 2015/16 Annual ReportBUILD AT CAMH WE BUILD Bright and early for a good cause Everyone who touches CAMH will become an advocate for mental health AMH is inspiring Canadians to join a movement for social change that will transform the future of mental health in Canada. This movement advocates for better access to mental health services for the one in three who don't receive the care they need \u2014 a groundswell that challenges stigma and calls for action to improve the lives of Canadians affected by mental illness. As the flagship event in this movement, CAMH One Brave Night for Mental Health invites Canadians to join the cause and share one night to inspire hope for the one in five people who experience a mental illness in any given year. How much is a good night's sleep worth? To Annette Verschuren, more than $125,000. That's how much Annette, a CAMH Foundation board member, raised by giving up sleep for a night as part of CAMH's all-night challenge to defeat mental illness. \"I'm a very action-oriented person, and that's what I love about CAMH One Brave Night for Mental Health \u2014 you have to do something,\" says Annette, top fundraiser for the all-night event for the second year in a row. \"The challenge gets people involved, and gets them talking about mental health.\" Participants create their own all-night challenge \u2014 a board game tournament or all-night dinner party, for example. For her part, Annette enjoyed a quiet movie night with her sister.At dawn, participants post their #sunriseselfie to stand in support of those living with mental illness. \"It may not be so comfortable to stay up all night, but it's for a great cause and it's so important to be able to give back,\" Annette says. The challenge attracted thousands of participants and support from corporate partners CIBC (Team Sponsor), Sleep Country Canada (Sleep Pass Sponsor), and Boston Pizza and Cineplex (Rewards). CAMH One Brave Night raised more than $830,000 on May 13. The event is just one way the community is supporting the highest priority needs of the hospital and spreading awareness about mental illness at the same time. Last year, CAMH welcomed more than 9,000 new Change Agents, who support the CAMH cause through our monthly donor program. In October, CAMH launched Stop Suicide, a powerful awareness campaign aimed at preventing youth suicide. Through emotional images, the television and digital campaign shared the stories of real people who have lost family members to suicide and invited viewers to become Change Agents themselves.

Faster, fuller recovery from even the most serious mental illness. A better understanding of what causes psychosis so that it can be prevented before it starts. Care for people who might otherwise fall through the cracks \u2014 like young people, older adults and those in Aboriginal communities. A leading-edge hospital with warm, welcoming spaces. The vision of a world in which everyone believes life is worth living, and the next breakthroughs in mental health \u2014 here at CAMH. \"Together, we are building a hospital that contributes to the mental health of people in our neighbourhood, the city, the province and the world,\" says Jamie Anderson, Breakthrough Campaign Chair. \"As a result of Breakthrough, CAMH will have the resources it needs to drive groundbreaking discovery, revolutionize care and actively engage with the community.\" There is tremendous momentum behind Breakthrough; we have already reached $160 million of our goal. In the last year, nearly 19,000 new donors have joined CAMH's efforts to help more people recover faster; inspire hope through discovery; and stop mental illness from destroying lives. From monthly donors to visionary donors to members of the Michael Wilson Society, the community is sending a clear message: the time is now to improve mental health.

Courage. Resilience. Hope \u2014 and a celebration. On May 25, 1,000 of CAMH's closest friends gathered at the Transforming Lives Awards to honour the extraordinary people who face mental illness and addiction with perseverance and dignity. It was a remarkable milestone \u2014 the 20th anniversary of a beloved signature event that celebrates the people who turn to us for care. The night also marked the last year the awards will be held on the grounds, as CAMH prepares to begin construction on our new Complex Care and Recovery and Crisis and Critical Care buildings in 2017. And what a night it was! Set under a spectacular tent at CAMH's Queen Street campus, the evening brought the CAMH community together to listen to stories of triumph and inspiration. By sharing their stories, award recipients help break down the stigma that surrounds mental illness. By celebrating their courage and commitment to recovery, we join them in this commitment. \"The Transforming Lives Awards have always been such a special celebration \u2014 a beautiful evening in which we are inspired by powerful stories of courage and strength,\" says Valerie Pringle, who co-chairs the Transforming Lives Awards with Dr. David Goldbloom. \"The 20th anniversary allowed us to take a moment to look back at how far we've come in mental health over the years, and to celebrate our progress in research, care and education. It also reminded us that we can't stop now because there is still so much to be done.\" The dazzling evening raised more than $1 million for CAMH.SThe 2016 Transforming Lives recipients are: Sheldon KennedyGail BellissimoOrlando Da SilvaEmily WrightJobim NovakRBC The Harry & Shirley Young Corporate Award was presented to RBC, which has helped strengthen both Transforming Lives Awards and UnMasked as long-time presenting sponsors.

Two new buildings facing Queen Street West are critical for those most in need: people who are acutely ill as well as those experiencing the most complex forms of mental illness, especially patients with schizophrenia. These new facilities will also support our academic mission to advance mental health, and promote positive changes in social attitudes. The Crisis and Critical Care Building will include the 24/7 Gerald Sheff and Shanitha Kachan Emergency Department, inpatient units and other programming. The Partial Hospital program will provide comprehensive care for people who do not need inpatient treatment, and CAMH will expand its reach to remote communities across Ontario through the TeleMental Health Services program. The building will also feature the Cope Family Patient Recovery Atrium. \"This redevelopment is a metaphor for the transformation of our understanding and treatment of mental illness. \" - Dr. Catherine Zahn \"George and I are such strong believers in the need for new facilities at CAMH as the first step toward both recovery and a new, more dignified and respectful approach to caring for people in need,\" says Tami Cope. The Complex Care and Recovery Building will feature in- and outpatient services for people with complex mental illness, and will be home to CAMH's WSimulation Centre, Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention, and state-of-the-art auditorium. \"This redevelopment \u2014 from the new light-filled buildings, to the extension of city streets throughout the campus, to the beautiful green spaces \u2014 is a metaphor for the transformation of our understanding and treatment of mental illness,\" says Dr. Catherine Zahn, CAMH President & CEO. \"We are tearing down walls both literally and figuratively.\" The redevelopment has resonated with donors. Richard Pilosof received care from CAMH for just a few hours, but the experience left an impression on him that will last a lifetime. \"My experience was very minor in the big picture, but it moved me because I felt vulnerable and definitely out of my element,\" says Richard, who turned to CAMH's emergency department for help with anxiety in December 2010. \"While there, I saw a number of people who were dealing with much more significant issues, and I realized the importance of raising awareness about mental illness \u2014 to let people know that CAMH exists and that it needs support.\" After conversations with friends and long-time CAMH supporters Valerie and Andy Pringle and Michael Wilson, Richard and Karen Pilosof made a generous gift to support the Gerald Sheff and Shanitha Kachan Emergency Department as part of the next phase of CAMH's redevelopment. \"There have been a lot of brave people who have come forward to talk about mental illness,\" Richard says. \"I realized I needed to thank the hospital for my care, and I was fortunate to be able to give back.\"BUILD AT CAMH WE BUILD28 29 CAMH & CAMH Foundation 2015/16 Annual ReportRecovery-enhancing care Rashida shines bright at the 12th annual Suits Me Fine Fashion Show, where patients walk the runway in celebration of recovery.

Here are just three of the wonderful third-party events held in support of CAMH. Dialog This spring, DIALOG hosted its 10th annual charity fundraiser \u2014 a day of golf, pampering, networking and fun. The event has supported CAMH for seven years, raising more than $200,000. \"It's an opportunity for DIALOG to give back and really make a difference within our cities,\" says Jim Anderson, Chair of DIALOG. \"Addiction and mental illnesses touch the community at every level.\" Put Up Your Dukes Now in its sixth year, Put Up Your Dukes celebrates the life of Ryan \"Duke\" Lewin while raising mental health awareness and funds for CAMH. After a long battle with mental illness, Ryan died by suicide at the age of 28. Proceeds from the event created Duke's Place at CAMH in 2011 and the Lewin Family Living and Learning Room, where patients can eat together as well as engage in conversation in a pleasant environment. Lovely Spring Run After running across Canada in 2009 to raise awareness about mental health \u2014 8,200 km! \u2014 you might think Wayne Cho would want to enjoy a well-earned break. Not so! For the last two years, he's organized Lovely Spring Run in April in support of CAMH. \"We choose to support CAMH because it is a wonderful organization that helps many affected by mental health challenges,\" says Wayne. \"We believe physical exercise is crucial to maintaining mental health.\" Bobbi & Harv LewinConnect with "}
