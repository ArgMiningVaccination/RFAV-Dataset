Moments later, the first woman notices an animated cheetah sitting in the corner of the room\u2014wearing sunglasses, playing chess. \"Felicia,\" says the cheetah, \"those are her whites in the dryer.\" He gives a knowing nod. Felicia grabs a handful of the bright orange Cheetos she's been munching and furtively smears them into the rude lady's gleaming white bedsheets. The cheetah disappears. \"Join us,\" reads the closing text. \"OrangeUnderground.com.\" (Click [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz40z6O9qcY) to watch the ad.) It's so heartening to see Chester Cheetah stretching himself for a role after all these years. Though he's long been a towering figure in the world of snack marketing, up to now Mr. Cheetah had never displayed an abundance of range. Frankly, I'd begun harboring doubts he was anything more than a two-dimensional jester. Take, for instance, Mr. Cheetah's appearance in a recent [Baked Cheetos television ad](http://www.cheetos.com/tv.php), which finds him performing a series of urban dance moves alongside a troupe of multicultural young children. The lanky physicality is there as always, and the sole line of dialogue (\"Whoa, cheesy!\") is delivered with the familiar, spirited growl. It's all solidly professional. But having seen this from Mr. Cheetah so many times before, the impact of this sort of performance is by now quite muted. How eager Mr. Cheetah must have been to sink his teeth into fresher, more challenging material. Chester is no longer just an excitable Cheetos fiend. He's evolved into a complex character, one with mysteriously dark motives. Why is he prodding us to do ill to our fellow man? How did he acquire a villainous, mid-Atlantic accent? And when did he learn to play chess? The short answer to all these questions: Chester is taking aim at a new target demographic. The impetus for the \"Orange Underground\" campaign was consumer research showing that it's not just kids who eat Cheetos. According to Cheetos brand manager Tyler Reeves, a full 60 percent of all Cheetos consumption is by adults. This apparently came as a surprise even to Cheetos executives. Personally, I haven't nibbled a Cheeto in years. Though I will confess that seeing this ad gave me an urge to buy a pack\u2014next time I'm drunk and in a convenience store. The act would satisfy a craving more for nostalgia than for corn-based snacks. So many memories. Hold on, I sense a poem brewing. The gritty, orange fingertips of youth pry the Cheeto from the foil bag, lift it to the light: irradiated twig. The flavor-burst of supercharged cheese\u2014startling, salivary. Lick fingers bare. Robert Riccardi, managing partner at Goodby Silverstein (the ad agency behind the new campaign), says that Chester's mischievous new personality stems from the idea that \"powering down\" Cheetos as an adult \"feels like a nonconformist moment. You're supposed to be eating arugula dip, but you have a nonconforming desire.\" Thus we see Chester (Riccardi says he exists only in our deep subconscious) encouraging people to shatter all sorts of adult norms. Ruin that woman's laundry, [shove Cheetos up that snoring Cheeto into your co-worker's laptop keyboard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSmGLfY0arE&feature=related), and so forth. I'm certain there have been a few prudish complaints. You pay a price for edgy. I was assured, however, that Chester never advocates such mischief when he's talking to the kiddies. These adult-targeted ads are aired only at night on channels like TBS and Comedy Central. The spots for kids are shown during the day on Nickelodeon and the Cartoon Network. There's also a stab at product separation\u2014though the average viewer might not notice the difference. The nighttime Chester is hawking classic Cheetos (with all the saturated fat you can swallow). The daytime Chester is pushing newer, slightly less unhealthy variations (no doubt to comply with some sort of regulatory pressure regarding childhood nutrition). I racked my brain but couldn't think of other spokes-characters who present different personalities to different demographic groups. Riccardi reminded me that Tony the Tiger, of Frosted Flakes fame (\"They're grrrrrrrrreat!\"), was a bit of a trailblazer in this regard. Tony was at first strictly for the kids but later began appearing over grown-ups' shoulders to insist that Frosted Flakes are \"the taste adults have grown to love.\" Tony never really changed his stripes, though. He was still the same friendly, upbeat tiger\u2014just pitching to a different audience. By contrast, Chester has fully reinvented himself with this creepy, countercultural zag. There's also a Web component to this Orange Underground campaign. (Because there always is.) We're encouraged to devise our own Cheetos-related pranks, then [post the resultant video evidence to YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/theorangeunderground). It seems this ploy [hasn't gotten much traction](http://www.sogoodblog.com/2008/02/13/cheetos-orange-underground-campaign-a-failure/) and has even [met with mild resistance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veAvkC-P1yk). As one food blog writes, \"Who in their right mind is actually going to go out and buy 20 bags of Cheetos to pull pranks with?\" Good point. Given that these things are constructed half of air and half of cheese dust, the per-weight cost of procuring mass quantities of Cheetos must be daunting. Grade: A-. Bizarre, moody spots that make me laugh. I love the details (the chess clock, the rapturous look on the flight attendant's face as Chester massages her, \" [double down](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X2qT7Ki29Y)\"). The humor isn't really in the notion that a cartoon Cheetah wants us to act like jackasses. It's more in the atmospherics of the ads\u2014the lack of music, the sinister tone, and, above all, Chester's cruel insouciance. Kudos on a successful rebranding of a character that had seemed destined to fade into cheesy oblivion.

Part wide-ranging meditation on Frantz Fanon, the Martinique-born revolutionary who studied the psychological effects of racial oppression, part autobiography, and part artistic credo, Wideman's first novel in a decade is fierce, elusive, and exhilarating. It's an extended prose improvisation that blurs the boundary between fiction and history. Wideman raises the question of whether it's still possible to achieve the kind of psychic liberation\u2014the birth of the \"whole man\"\u2014that Fanon argued must be the final goal of any struggle against racism. In particular, he measures Fanon's idealism against the crippling toll that American history has inflicted on his own family\u2014his brother incarcerated for 30 years, his wheelchair-bound mother stranded in a ravaged inner-city neighborhood\u2014and comes away feeling that Fanon's ideals feel almost as remote today as they did four decades ago. Wideman is a fascinating and underappreciated writer, and Fanon is, if anything, overly ambitious; it feels like three books condensed into one. Readers wanting a stronger narrative thread should seek out his [Philadelphia Fire](http://www.amazon.com/Philadelphia-Fire-John-Edgar-Wideman/dp/061850964X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204927247&sr=8-1) or [The Stories of John Edgar Wideman](http://www.amazon.com/All-Stories-are-True-Wideman/dp/0330333313/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204927288&sr=1-1), but anyone with even a passing interest in Fanon, or African-American literature and culture, should seek out this extraordinary book.\u2014 (illustrator). More a graphic short story than a graphic novel, Skim offers a glimpse over the shoulder of 16-year-old Kimberly Keiko Cameron, aka Skim. She has a broken arm, a best friend she doesn't really trust, a much desired yet confusing romance with a female teacher, a mother distracted by the breakup of her marriage, and, soon enough, a broken heart. The fake diary is by now a tired clich\u00e9 of teen novels, but Jillian Tamaki's artwork elevates the genre from the merely voyeuristic. We don't just read Skim's diary entries; we see what she erases, what she lies about, and what she has no words for. The black-and-white art is spare when Skim's life is under control; it's lush and packed with dense shading as she expands her horizons. Mariko Tamaki supplies brittle, Juno MacGuff-style repartee, but she also allows Skim to acknowledge the changes she is experiencing, even if she doesn't quite understand them: \"I think I'm in love. Being in love is not what I expected.\"\u2014 [June Thomas](http://www.slate.com/id/3944/qp/26107/) Humor [The McSweeney's Joke Book of Book Jokes](http://www.amazon.com/McSweeneys-Joke-Book-Jokes-Vintage/dp/030738733X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204921404&sr=1-1). The [McSweeney's Web site](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/) functions like a Chicken Soup for the Liberal-Arts Soul. Where else can you find a few lunch-hour [Kafka jokes](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2008/2/4chen.html) and [Faulkner parodies](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2007/7/26lott.html)? Fittingly, the McSweeney's Joke Book assembles the best bookish humor the site has produced so far. It's humor born out of writing workshops, sleepy afternoon seminars, caffeine, and stilted ambition. The collection is worth buying for \"Winnie-the-Pooh Is My Coworker\" alone. Another highlight is \"Feedback From James Joyce's Submission of Ulysses to His Creative Writing Workshop,\" from which I must quote one line: \"Think you accidentally stapled in something from your playwriting workshop for Ch. 15.\" The ideal reader of this book is one with a secret pride over how they \"totally own\" the Saturday Times crossword puzzle\u2014or your standard overeducated worker in search of diversion on a commute to a job that requires absolutely no understanding of synecdoche.\u2014 [Michael Agger](http://www.slate.com/id/3944/qp/36076/) Non-Fiction [A Brief History of Anxiety (Yours and Mine)](http://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Anxiety-Yours-Mine/dp/0679314989/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204753566&sr=8-1'), by Patricia Pearson. A skilled mix of memoir and research, Pearson's short collection of essays investigates what it's like to be constantly choked by lurid internal drama. Despite the subject, Pearson's writing is often exhilarating (\"I felt a certain kind of bra-ha-ha joy. Like a character in a Stephen King novel who suddenly laughs hysterically after all of her friends' heads have exploded\"), and it's certainly lighter than her earlier nonfiction account of female criminals, [When She Was Bad](http://www.amazon.com/When-She-Was-Bad-Innocence/dp/0140243887/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204753783&sr=1-3). Pearson makes plenty of intriguing (\"parents consistently underestimate the intensity of their children's fears\") and arguable (the modern era is uniquely overpopulated by twitchy and freaked-out masses) observations. Her first five essays are particularly finely crafted. The last four are a little loose. Still, they include an angry and important cautionary tale detailing the psychological and physical wreckage that ensues when someone takes, and then [tries to go off, Effexor](http://www.slate.com/id/95903/). If you're anxious all the time and you think about that anxiety a lot, this collection will provide you some companionable relief.\u2014 [Christine Kenneally](http://www.slate.com/id/3944/qp/29083/) [The Hebrew Republic: How Secular Democracy and Global Enterprise Will Bring Israel Peace At Last](http://www.amazon.com/Hebrew-Republic-Secular-Democracy-Enterprise/dp/0151014523/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204911295&sr=8-1), by Bernard Avishai. Bernard Avishai has long been one of the foremost interpreters of Israeli society. His 1985 book, [The Tragedy of Zionism](http://www.amazon.com/Tragedy-Zionism-Revolutionary-Israeli-Democracy/dp/1581152582/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204912079&sr=1-2), offered a bold new interpretation of the history of political Zionism and made Avishai both a beloved and loathed figure in Israel, where he has lived off and on for decades. His new book, The Hebrew Republic, tackles an even trickier topic: Israeli identity. In Israel, there are two categories of personal identity: Israeli citizenship and Jewish nationality. All occupants of the state are eligible for citizenship. But because Israel was founded exclusively as a Jewish country, only a Jew can claim nationality and all the material benefits\u2014residency rights, tax breaks, and subsidized mortgages\u2014that come with it. It is this paradox that Avishai believes puts the lie to Israel's claim to be at once \"Jewish and democratic.\" The answer, for Avishai, is to transform Israel from a Jewish state into what he terms a Hebrew Republic, one in which Israeli identity is based not on a person's Jewishness but rather on a shared sense of Hebrew culture that can be adopted by Arab and Jew alike. This solution is at once pragmatic and troubling. Avishai admits how hard it may be for Palestinian Israelis to assimilate into \"Hebrew culture.\" But he also notes, correctly, that such assimilation is already taking place. In any case, Avishai is right to conclude that Israel's only chance for a peaceful future is to re-examine its present concept of nationality.\u2014 [Reza Aslan](http://www.slate.com/id/3944/qp/41302/) [Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions](http://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Hidden-Forces-Decisions/dp/006135323X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204727745&sr=8-1), by Dan Ariely. In his debut work of popular economics, Ariely\u2014a professor at MIT\u2014sets out to show that irrational behavior is not, well, so crazy after all. At any rate, it is predictable. We derive greater relief from a $1 aspirin than from the same drug priced at 10 cents. We also overvalue what we own, just because it is ours. And we snap up things when they are offered to us for free, even if we don't value them very much or if we have to pass up superior opportunities elsewhere. A behavioral economist at home in both psychology and economics, Ariely makes an entertaining and convincing case that a field that has long put rational actors in the foreground should pay more attention to feelings, expectations, and social conventions.\u2014 [Tyler Cowen](http://www.slate.com/id/3944/qp/43541/) [The Three Trillion Dollar War: The True Cost of the Iraq Conflict](http://www.amazon.com/Three-Trillion-Dollar-War-Conflict/dp/0393067017/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204912210&sr=1-1), by Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes. The Three Trillion Dollar War isn't intended to convince readers of the folly of the Iraq Project; after all, no price tag, no matter how high, could persuade the dwindling core of true believers\u2014schmoes like William Kristol\u2014that the invasion wasn't worthwhile. Instead, Stiglitz and Bilmes take the idiocy and mendacity of the Bush administration as a baseline assumption and methodically crunch numbers. Toting up the costs of everything from long-term disability payments to injured soldiers to interest incurred on the national debt as a result of Iraq spending, they arrive at a nice round figure: $3 trillion. Like all such exercises, the book contains a combination of precision (the lifetime economic value of a soldier killed in the war is $7.2 million) and guesstimation (they conclude that the price of oil is $10 per barrel higher than it should be due to the war). And since big portions of the $3 trillion in costs are spread out over decades, the immediate macroeconomic impact probably isn't as large as advertised. Critics can accuse Stiglitz and Bilmes of not trying seriously to quantify the benefits of the war, which, in theory, would balance out some of the costs. To which I say: Go for it. Since it's nigh on impossible to document any economic gains that have accrued to the United States as a result of the invasion, that would be a fool's errand. Alas, as this book reminds us, there are plenty of fools around.\u2014 [Daniel Gross](http://www.slate.com/id/3944/qp/26260/) Is it possible for a single speech to change the rules of political discourse in America? In my lifetime, that claim has been made for Martin Luther King's \" [I Have a Dream](http://www.mlkonline.net/dream.html)\" speech in 1963 and for Ronald Reagan's \" [Tear Down This Wall](http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/speeches/speech.asp?spid=25)\" speech in 1987. We may yet hear the same claim made for the refreshingly [honest and eloquent speech](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23690567/) about race that Barack Obama delivered this morning in Philadelphia. It was a speech that, had I been Obama's campaign manager, I would have advised him not to give, because it gave no quarter to the realities of identity politics as practiced in American politics. Obama's task was to distance himself from [incendiary comments](http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB120545277093135111.html) uttered by his former preacher the Rev. Jeremiah Wright without alienating himself from the black community. My presumption was that it couldn't be done\u2014that the ritualistic denunciation demanded by the white community would be inherently offensive to the black community. Better to say as little as possible and to hope it blows over quickly, which seemed to work when Obama's wife, Michelle, last month committed a [subtler gaffe](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/02/19/cindy-mccain-michelle-obama-in-patriotism-flap/) (\"For the first time in my adult lifetime, I'm really proud of our country\") that required near-immediate \" [clarification](http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/politics/2008/02/20/obama.country.love.wjar).\" To elaborate beyond a simple, terse condemnation of Wright, I'd have said, would only pour gasoline on the fire. But I'd have been wrong.

It's helped Hillary Clinton and hurt Obama. For example, on the morning of the New Hampshire primary, the New York Times [published](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/opinion/08steinem.html?_r=2&ref=opinion&oref=slogin&oref=slogin) a remarkably [whiny](http://www.slate.com/id/2181646/) op-ed by Gloria Steinem essentially arguing that Clinton was more deserving of the presidency than Obama because (she argued) in American society, women are bigger victims than blacks. Kathleen Deveny, an assistant manager editor at Newsweek, later [echoed](http://www.newsweek.com/id/120069) this line. Geraldine Ferraro's famous [gaffe](http://www.dailybreeze.com/ci_8489268?source=rss_viewed) blaming Obama's success on his blackness was in large part a blunter version of the very same argument (which may explain why she was [so puzzled](http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080312/pl_nm/usa_politics_ferraro_dc_1) later that it caused so much controversy): \"I think what America feels about a woman becoming president takes a very secondary place to Obama's campaign\u2014to a kind of campaign that it would be hard for anyone to run against,\" she said. \"For one thing, you have the press, which has been uniquely hard on her. It's been a very sexist media. Some just don't like her. The others have gotten caught up in the Obama campaign. \"If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position,\" she continued. \"And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept.\" Clinton didn't disavow Steinem's op-ed or Deveny's Newsweek disavow what Ferraro and\u2014when Ferraro wouldn't apologize for the remark\u2014to [remove her](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/03/12/ferraro-steps-down/) from her finance committee. But despite the embarrassment, it's unlikely the incident will harm Hillary in the long run. Turnout for Hillary has been consistently high among white women because many of them interpret Clinton's various setbacks as evidence of [sexism](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/10/us/politics/10women.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1&sq=Jodi%20Kantor&scp=1&oref=slogin). The calculus has been entirely different for Obama, if only because African-Americans represent 13 percent of the U.S. population compared with women's 50 percent. From the start, Obama distanced himself so completely from identity politics that as recently as October, Clinton [led Obama among black voters](http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/10/17/poll.blacks.democrats/index.html) 57 percent to 33 percent. That has since changed, partly because of Bill Clinton's uncharacteristically [maladroit comparison](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqd2dfjl2pw) of Obama's support in South Carolina to that of Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988. This created resentment among African-Americans that Obama was being marginalized because of his race. Obama himself kept above the fray, and it's striking that in what Slate's John Dickerson has aptly termed the \" [Umbrage War](http://www.slate.com/id/2186242/)\" between the Obama and Clinton campaigns, no Obama partisans were jettisoned for making any strident declarations of black alienation from white America. Or rather, none until the Rev. Wright, who, after he was quoted saying \" [not God bless America\u2014God damn America](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH5ixmT83JE)!\" and \" [Hillary ain't never been called a nigger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKpCH7OS2nc)\" was compelled to resign from the campaign's [spiritual advisory committee](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23634881/). Wright's outbursts posed an impossible dilemma for Obama, not only because he risked having to choose between white support and black\u2014language deeply offensive to whites being fairly routine in the sermons of black ministers preaching to black congregations\u2014but because Wright was a close friend, and spurning him on a personal level would have made Obama look opportunistic and phony. Remarkably, Obama found a way to thread the needle. Wright's comments, he said in today's speech, \"were not only wrong but divisive,\" and his church contains in full the kindness and cruelty, the fierce intelligence and the shocking ignorance, the struggles and successes, the love and yes, the bitterness and bias that make up the black experience in America. Obama continued, I can no more disown [Wright] than I can disown the black community. I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother\u2014a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe. These people are a part of me. And they are a part of America, this country that I love. Wright's mistake, Obama said, is not that he spoke about racism in our society. It's that he spoke as if our society was static; as if no progress has been made; as if this country\u2014a country that has made it possible for one of his own members to run for the highest office in the land and build a coalition of white and black; Latino and Asian, rich and poor, young and old\u2014is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past. But what we know\u2014what we have seen\u2014is that America can change. This isn't about taking sides, Obama said. (By noting his mixed parentage, Obama pointed out that he couldn't take sides even if he wanted to without denying a part of himself.) This is about recognizing the legitimate grievances of blacks and whites, often expressed in the language of bigotry and bitterness, and then moving to address them. It's about not ignoring the ugliness in American life\u2014when's the last time you heard a politician admit that ugliness can be found even in American churches?\u2014but neither is it about defining yourself solely in opposition to that ugliness. It's about keeping your eye on the ball, staying focused on what can be achieved, even when the conversation turns to race, the single most divisive topic in American life. (My apologies to feminists, but we didn't fight a civil war over the place of women in American society.) It's about rejecting identity politics while honoring the nobler aspirations of the identity politicians. And it's about feeling confident that positive social change can be achieved, because it's been achieved in this country in the past. That Obama managed to say all this without displaying an ounce of false piety, or bitterness, or sentimentality, or denial, or self-righteousness, makes his speech a milestone in American political rhetoric. In a March 18 \" [Trailhead](http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/trailhead/archive/2008/03/18/boomers-to-the-back-of-the-bus.aspx),\" Chadwick Matlin misidentified Barack Obama's former pastor Jeremiah Wright as James Wright.

Please send your questions for publication to [prudence@slate.com](mailto:prudence@slate.com). (Questions may be edited.) Dear Prudie, I'm in my 30s, and my daughter recently turned 2. I work outside the home, and my wife stays home with our daughter. As my daughter has gotten older, I find that spending time with her is less and less enjoyable. When she was an infant, and I could cuddle up with her on the couch and read a book or watch television, things were fine. Now that she's more demanding, I find it quite frustrating. I feel like my wife pushes us together in the interests of keeping me involved in her life. I realize that my wife needs a break when I get home. However, I just spent eight hours at the office\u2014it's not like I'm on a wonderful vacation all day. When I was a kid, my dad was involved, but somewhat less \"hands-on\" than would be considered the modern ideal. I hate to say it, but I just don't enjoy Easter egg hunts or playing in the sand box. It's not that I don't love my daughter. I do! I just feel like I'm drowning. \u2014Terrible Twos Dear Terrible, You are drowning if at the end of the day your little girl running to you and saying, \"Dada, Dada\" fills you with dread. It sounds as if the only part of fatherhood you've enjoyed so far is the fact that as long as an infant is not crying, you can pretend she's a stuffed animal. And, yes, while you aren't on vacation all day, neither is your wife\u2014you acknowledge that spending time with a 2-year-old is hard. However, I give you credit for being able to express what these days is considered inexpressible. Secretly, there are a lot of parents driven around the bend by the endless, monotonous play of toddlers. But while you may have loved your father, do you really want to emulate his distant style? You may be one of those parents who finds that when you can have real conversations with your daughter or coach her at soccer, you will feel a true fulfillment and connection with her. But you have a 2-year-old, and finding a way to enjoy her now will build a bridge to something better when she's older. My suggestion: Let her do things she enjoys, while you do things you enjoy. Your time with her doesn't have to be second-by-second interaction. You can be one of those parents who sits on the bench around the sandbox, absorbed in your BlackBerry, occasionally looking up and making encouraging sounds while she flings her shovel. Put her in a swing and push her for 10 minutes while you listen to your iPod. Get a jogging stroller and plop her in it while you go out for a run. And occasionally focus enough so that when she puts her arms around you and says, \"I love you,\" it feels like a life raft, not an anchor. \u2014Prudie Dear Prudence Video: Snooze Alarm Junkie Dear Prudie, When I was in my 20s, I was deeply in love with a man who was in his 50s. After we broke up, we remained in touch as friends, though I have been happily married with children for over 20 years. He is now elderly and in weakening health but has no family and not many able-bodied friends. I have always loved him and enjoyed his company and want to visit him every couple of weeks to make sure he is getting enough to eat and managing alone. I am in contact with his relatives in another state, and they appreciate it if I keep them posted. They can and will travel here in times of crisis, so this isn't strictly my problem, but I care enough to want to be involved. The problem is that my husband feels threatened by my attachment to this man and resents anything more than an occasional phone call and perhaps lunch on his birthday. What should I do? \u2014Still Cares Dear Still, I wish your husband could see this situation for what it is: a wonderful testament to your character and a reassurance that if he becomes the infirm partner someday, you will lovingly tend to him. If you have the good marriage that you claim, you need to air this more thoroughly with your husband. Acknowledge his discomfort, even tell him that you feel flattered he is concerned about this man's feelings for you, but make clear that your husband is the love of your life, and there is nothing going on that should be of any concern to him. Tell him you know it doesn't sound like much of an outing, but that you would be delighted if he would accompany you when you checked in on your old friend. Reassure him that there is simply no romantic feeling involved anymore (don't say you still love him\u2014that's too provocative), just a sense of loyalty to someone you still care about who is facing the end alone. \u2014Prudie Dear Prudence, My spouse and I have three small kids. In our part of the country, this is considered an extremely large family. When we enter a restaurant, market, city sidewalk, or even an open public park, perfect strangers are often unable to stifle their denigrating comments about it. It's not so much the faux-sympathy of \"Wow, you have your hands full\" that is bothersome, but rather zingers like \"That's quite a gaggle you have there\" or \"Look at that brood.\" Then there's the occasional suggestion that it's socially irresponsible, and the world would be better off without some of us. (I'm not exaggerating.) This is not a matter of taking small children places where they don't belong or can't behave\u2014it has less to do with their behavior than their existence. How do I turn back these interlopers? \u2014Brooding Dear Brooding, A family with three children elicits stunned reactions? What part of the country do you live in, Tokyo? There, the birthrate has so bottomed out that clever manufacturers, seeking to fulfill the longing of desperate old people who know they will never have grandchildren, are manufacturing [talking dolls](http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=565&fSetId=662&fArticleId=2423986) that the elderly pretend are alive. Thank you for doing your part to keep us from facing a future that resembles [Children of Men](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206634/). I do wonder if you haven't become so sensitized that you are hearing denigration in remarks (\"Look at the brood!\") that might just be acknowledging the cuteness of your kids. In general, I recommend simply ignoring the ignoramuses who want to pass judgment on one's children, race, disability, etc. If you want to say something in response to more ambiguous comments, you can always smile and say, \"Yes, someone's got to pay for our Social Security.\" But for people who actually come up to you and suggest your children shouldn't exist, feel free to step in front of your kids and tell the idiot, \"Please move away from my family\" or, \"I have to agree with you. It would be better if some people had never been born.\" \u2014Prudie Dear Prudence, I'm going to a bridal shower, and the host wants all the guests to bring their own self-addressed, stamped envelopes for the bride to make it easier for her to write thank you notes. I feel even the busiest bride should be able to take the time to write thank you notes. I don't want to say anything, but I just want to know if this is tacky. \u2014Thanks, But No Thanks Dear Thanks, It's only fair to recognize that manners and mores do change. Today's brides are so busy planning a military campaign's worth of parties and celebrations for themselves that expectations by their guests should be adjusted to acknowledge the stress orchestrating all this adulation can cause. How thoughtless it would be to arrive with a self-addressed, stamped envelope into which you have stuck a blank card. The bride doesn't have time to fill that out! Instead, be a considerate guest and take a few extra minutes to write on the card, \"Dear Self, Thank me for the lovely chafing dish. The bride will think of me fondly whenever she chafes.\" \u2014Prudie It's been determined that taxi drivers have the most dangerous job in Iraq, and if the [Iraq Veterans Against the War Winter Soldier](http://ivaw.org/wintersoldier) event this past weekend had taken place in Baghdad, my taxi driver might have gotten us both killed. Luckily, it occurred at the National Labor College in Silver Spring, Md. On Friday morning, as we entered the campus from the Beltway, a dozen or so protesters held signs denouncing the testifying soldiers: \"WINTER SOLDIER MY ASS,\" one read. Security was tight. The Montgomery County sheriff's department operated out of a mobile unit that looked so innocuous you might have assumed they were selling corn dogs after a Little League game. But the paramilitary attire of the nearby riot-ready cops would quickly disabuse you of that notion. By the campus' entryway stood a group of IVAW supporters acting as further security. My taxi driver tried to dodge them but got held up by a burly, middle-aged guy. \"What is going on?\" asked the driver. What was going on? Approximately 55 former members of the U.S. military were preparing to testify about the ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan\u2014or what the IVAW consistently refers to as \"occupations.\" No brainchild of the Pentagon, IVAW modeled its conference after the controversial 1971 [Winter Soldier event](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Soldier_Investigation) that vivified (some say fictionalized) war crimes, human rights abuses, and military waste then occurring in Vietnam. The IVAW has three unifying aims: immediate withdrawal of all American troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, reparations for the Iraqi people, and consistent and reliable medical care for all veterans of the war. Over the course of four days, the conference planned to address the continual breakdown and failure of military rules of engagement, the long-term societal cost of the war in the form of broken families and broken minds, the drastic privatization of the war in Iraq, racism and sexism in the military, and the future of GI resistance. And with Winter Soldier, the IVAW hoped to gain more media attention for the anti-war movement. Entering the hall where the testimony was taking place, you might have thought you were at a \"peace and social justice\" conference at a Pacific Northwest liberal-arts college. Many of the audience members sported gray ponytails, and some of the security staff were members of Vietnam Veterans Against the War. But most of the IVAW soldiers testifying were born after 1982. For them, the Vietnam War brings up images of Pvt. Pyle from Full Metal Jacket and Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now. Many participants of Winter Soldier 1971 had worn combat fatigues, and the event had come together catch-as-catch-can, with few resources and little polish; but Winter Soldier 2008 felt like a finely produced corporate workshop. The women I saw testify were in business attire. And while some of the men were in faded fatigues and desert boonie caps, hip-slung jeans, and hoodies, just as many wore suits or sport jackets. These are the new anti-war vets, and they know how to use image and technology to their advantage. Jose Vasquez, IVAW board member and president of the New York chapter, told me, \"I'm interested in professionalizing the organization.\" Vasquez served nearly 14 years in the active-duty Army and the Army reserve, initially as a cavalry scout and later posting as a training NCO for battle medics. It looked to me as though he'd left the barracks just hours ago. He made me\u2014a former Marine\u2014want to shave my unruly beard, tuck in my shirt, and knock out 20 four-count push-ups for good measure. Born in the Bronx, Vasquez grew up in California and signed up for the Army in 1992 at the age of 17. Now pursuing a Ph.D. in anthropology, he's a soft-spoken man who cared deeply for the Army and the soldiers he warmly calls \"Joes\"; he'd planned to spend 30 years serving his country. After 9/11, he would have served in Afghanistan with few reservations; but by the time his unit got the call for Iraq in 2005, he'd been having doubts not only about the efficacy of the war but about the morality of serving. As a medic, he patched soldiers' wounds so that they could head out on another mission and kill again. After \"a lot of soul-searching,\" Vasquez applied for conscientious-objector status, and more than a year later he separated from the Army with an honorable discharge. When he described the day he told the men he led that he was not going to Iraq with them, Vasquez sounded remorseful and sad. He misses the Army and his Joes. Critics will instantly identify any soldier testifying about immoral behavior on the battlefield as a bad seed. So Vasquez implemented an exhaustive process to confirm the veracity of the testimony being offered; his title is \"IVAW verification team leader.\" Drawing on his background as an anthropologist, he trained 14 team members, mostly combat vets, in the verification process. Membership in IVAW was not required in order to offer testimony. \"We were willing at least to take testimony from anybody, whether or not they were a member. They didn't even have to agree with our points of unity. If you had a story to tell about Iraq and you were able to prove your service, then we would give you a venue to spread that word.\" All told, approximately 140 people have come forward to offer testimony. It wasn't possible to have everyone testify this weekend, but Vasquez vows that IVAW will give anyone with a story to tell the venue to do so. Clifton Hicks, a dead ringer for a young Matt Dillon, served in the Army as a tank driver and .50-caliber machine gunner from 2003 to 2004. His own testimony\u2014among other things, he recalled watching a five-building apartment complex full of civilians being riddled with gunfire from a warplane\u2014troubled him deeply. When I spoke to him Saturday morning, the totality of the first day of Winter Soldier was wearing heavily on him. He told me that for the first time since becoming an anti-war activist, he felt like quitting. Re-experiencing the destruction of war and thinking about friends who had died made him feel again \"that I no longer cared about my life. ... I felt like the only way I could make things right is to just strip my clothing and walk naked back to Florida, you know. ... Just pay a penance or something.\" A panel on Friday about the rules of engagement, Hicks said, was \"hard-hitting.\" During it, much of the testimony was of witness: abuse of Iraqi prisoners and detainees, indiscriminate firing in urban areas, the quick erosion of the rules as soon as someone in a unit died. As Hicks told me, \"That [panel] was the personal shit, the upfront shit. I murdered shitloads of people. Not 'I saw shitloads of people die from a distance and thought it was funny.' \" Jon Turner, a former Marine and current resident of Burlington, Vt., looks like he'd be more comfortable playing footbag or Frisbee than firing a weapon. On Friday afternoon, he'd given some of the more dramatic testimony. He opened by saying, \"There is a term, 'Once a Marine, always a Marine.' But there is also a term, 'Eat the apple, F the corps.' \" He then ripped off the ribbons pinned to his shirt, threw them to the ground, and declared, \"I don't work for you no more.\" He had served two tours in Iraq with Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion of the 8th Marines, operating in Ramadi and Fallujah. He then played a few videos he'd made while in Iraq. The first video he played was of his executive officer, after having called in a 500-pound bomb, saying, \"I think I just killed half the population of northern Ramadi. Fuck the red tape.\" Then he played video of a missile attack on a Ministry of Health building. He spoke about the standard procedure of a \"weapon drop\": When mistakes are made, you drop a weapon on the innocent dead man so it appears he was a combatant. He showed photos of a man's brain. \"This wasn't my kill, it was my friend's,\" he stated. When the next image of a corpse appeared on the big screens in the hall, he continued, \"On April 18, 2006, I had my first confirmed kill. Ahh. This man was innocent. I don't know his name. I call him the Fat Man. He was walking back to his house, and I shot him in front of his friend and father. The first round didn't kill him after I hit him up here in his neck area. And afterward he started screaming and looked right into my eyes. So I looked at my friend who I was on post with and said, 'Well, can't let that happen.' So I took another shot and took him out.\" It took seven members of the Fat Man's family to move his body. After his first kill, Turner says, \"My company commander personally congratulated me as he did everyone else in our company. This is the same individual who had stated that whoever gets their first kill by stabbing them to death will get a four-day pass when we return from Iraq.\" On Saturday, Turner and I sat outside on a bench. Some of his buddies were playing Frisbee nearby and a mutt dog named Resistance ran around on the grass, yapping among the former soldiers. Jon had a number of tattoos, nothing new for a military guy, but the ones that most interested me were the five small crosses on his left wrist, for the five KIAs of Kilo Company, and the Arabic script on his right wrist, which, he claimed, meant \"fuck you.\" He had this on his right wrist because, as he said during his testimony, it was his \"choking wrist.\" He left us all to imagine what that meant. Jon has shaggy blond hair and a scraggly beard and a comely, easy smile. In him, I saw the ghost of a young, sweet kid who had joined the corps because he loved his country and he wanted to help protect it. And I saw the hardened and haunted young man who spends a lot of time chasing demons he thought he'd left in Iraq, among them the Fat Man and a man who had the unfortunate luck of bicycling by Jon's checkpoint on a day when Jon simply wanted to kill and the media embed was with another platoon, so his platoon had free rein. Jon has PTSD. Jon has quit drinking and smoking. He still dips tobacco, but that's a minor thing, considering. He doesn't do therapy\u2014got tired of that\u2014but he talks to his friends from IVAW, better therapy than anything. He's started making art, and with a buddy in Burlington he makes combat paper\u2014he reconstitutes camouflage uniforms Marines have worn in combat, turning the uniforms into paper that he binds into books. He's writing some poetry. He's trying to make something good from the waste that was Iraq. Two weeks ago, the Financial Times [reported](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f15d68a2-ea55-11dc-b3c9-0000779fd2ac.html) that Amazon.com was gearing up to sell wine. The company had posted an ad for a senior wine buyer who would be responsible for putting together a \"massive new product selection.\" For oenophiles, this was potentially huge, and not just because Amazon would likely be stocking lots of stellar wines at great prices; the entry of the Internet retailing colossus into the business seemed just the thing to finally break the logjam over interstate wine shipping. The topic of direct shipping is one I've avoided till now because, frankly, it gives me a worse headache than a hangover. But with word of Amazon's apparently imminent foray into the world of cabernets and Syrahs, I decided duty obliged me to try to figure out what this might portend for the direct-shipping battle. The experience has left me with a migraine, and now you get to share my pain. You might vaguely recall that three years ago, the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision on interstate shipping, and you might vaguely recall all your oenophile friends exchanging high-fives and guzzling Haut-Brion in celebration. In [Granholm vs. Heald](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1116.ZS.html), the court decreed that states could not bar out-of-state wineries from shipping directly to consumers if in-state wineries were allowed to do so. The ruling was hailed as a potentially lethal blow to the grossly inefficient three-tier system by which wine (and other liquor) is distributed in the United States. The three-tier distribution system is an outgrowth of the 21st Amendment, which ended Prohibition. To more effectively regulate alcohol sales in the wake of the repeal, most states decided to place an independent intermediary, the wholesaler, between producers and retailers. The result was an incoherent patchwork of liquor laws nationwide, laws that have become comically anachronistic with the advent of online shopping and ever cheaper, easier shipping. The Supreme Court seemed to agree: In the Granholm decision, it ruled that laws in Michigan and New York allowing direct shipping from in-state wineries but prohibiting it from out-of-state producers were unfairly disadvantaging the competition and therefore unconstitutional. The ruling did not, however, obliges states to make direct-to-consumer shipping legal or hassle-free. Three years on, the court's decision has yielded varying degrees of liberalization in a handful of states, lots of legislative chicanery, and a distribution system that is possibly even more convoluted than before. \"People broke out the Champagne a little early,\" says R. Corbin Houchins, an antitrust lawyer with a national practice in licensed beverage distribution. According to [Free the Grapes!](http://www.freethegrapes.org/), a direct-shipping advocacy group, 35 states now permit some form of direct-to-consumer shipping from out-of-state wineries, up from 25 before Granholm. But the liquor wholesalers, a deeply entrenched and well-funded lobby, are waging a furious and fairly successful battle to maintain the status quo. Several states, notably Ohio, have placed strict caps on the amount of wine that can be shipped from wineries in other states, provisions that amount to backdoor discrimination; ditto the Kansas law, enacted in 2006, permitting direct shipping but only in cases where the consumer has physically purchased the wine at the winery. Then there is the retail front: In Granholm, the court addressed the concerns of wine producers but said nothing about wine merchants, who are battling even tougher restrictions. (Just 16 states permit direct-to-consumer shipping from out-of-state retailers.) Still with me? Amid all the legal wrangling, the news that Amazon would be jumping into the wines business was initially greeted with delight by oenophiles, who figured it would mean cheaper prices and lower shipping costs. (As the job ad suggested, the company would be buying in bulk; presumably, it would be negotiating discounted prices and passing along the savings to consumers.) There was an even more tantalizing prospect: It stood to reason that Amazon, confronting the same regulatory morass as every other wine merchant, would be wading into the fray over interstate shipping, a potentially game-breaking development given the company's heft and clout. Certainly, a giant like Amazon wouldn't be inclined to simply accommodate itself to such an illogical and antiquated distribution system. Or maybe it would. After the FT story broke, British wine magazine [Decanter](http://www.decanter.com/) reported that Amazon would be teaming up with the largest existing Internet wine retailer, Wine.com. The companies formed a short-lived partnership in 2005, and at least according to Decanter, the deal was back on, which came as a rude shock to wine buffs who had been toasting Amazon just hours earlier. That is because Wine.com is now the most hated name in booze. It was recently [disclosed](http://www.decanter.com/news/174024.html) that the San Francisco-based firm executed a sting operation in which it posed as a consumer, had wine illegally shipped to it from wine retailers around the country, and reported the violations to state authorities. Wine.com has structured its business to diligently comply with existing state laws, but judging by the outraged reaction among wine fans, this was a case of committing hari-kari with a corkscrew\u2014many people felt betrayed by the company and vowed to no longer buy from it. But it turns out the indignation about an Amazon-Wine.com partnership was unnecessary: Decanter erroneously reported that the two were pairing up. Nor, two weeks later, has Amazon actually confirmed that it is entering the wine business (though the job ad is still posted). However, fallout from Wine.com's online vigilantism continues to rain down. The Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America recently sent a [letter](http://www.wswa.org/public/media/Regulation%20letter%20text.pdf) to officials in all 50 states calling attention to the Wine.com sting and highlighting the \"astounding and revealing\" reaction of some in the wine community. It cited an [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/dining/30pour.html) by New York Times wine columnist Eric Asimov in which he admitted to having a bottle illegally shipped to him by a retailer in California. \"That a newspaper of record would publish such comments in the full light of day, we believe, ought to trouble any regulator, lawmaker or law enforcement official,\" the letter intoned. \"Lack of enforcement has clearly allowed this culture of lawlessness to flourish. ...\" No, asinine laws have allowed it to flourish. Stephen Bainbridge, a law professor at UCLA who also maintains an excellent wine [blog](http://www.professorbainbridgeonwine.com/), is sticking by what he wrote in a [column](http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=061206B) for TCS Daily on the one-year anniversary of the Granholm decision: \"We're no closer to a true national wine market; instead, both producers and consumers are still mired in the economic Balkans.\" Bainbridge thinks the best hope of fixing the current distribution system is to challenge it on antitrust grounds. Costco, the country's largest wine retailer, mounted just such an effort in a suit it brought against the state of Washington four years ago. It won a resounding victory in a federal district court in 2006, but that verdict was overturned in late January by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. Costco is appealing to have the case heard by the entire 9th Circuit, and there is a chance the matter will end up before the Supreme Court\u2014eventually. \"I am just damn glad I live in California,\" says Bainbridge, noting that his home state has some of the most progressive shipping laws in the nation. By now, the same analogy that occurs to me has possibly occurred to you: The way we transport and deliver booze in this country is as Byzantine as the process by which we choose presidents. Earlier this month, the battle over wine and the battle for the White House even intersected, briefly. At the same time that Hillary Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson was comparing Barack Obama to Ken Starr, the Specialty Wine Retailers Association was circulating a fundraising letter lauding Starr's leadership in the fight to liberalize interstate shipping laws (you read right: Ken Starr is trying to make it easier for you to buy wine, not harder). Personally, I think the current primary system is no way to choose a president, and the three-tier distribution system is definitely no way to get a man his grog. And with that, my first and last article about interstate wine shipping comes to an end. Thank you for reading, and pass the Tylenol. Things still look bleak for Obama in Pennsylvania, as a [new poll](http://edisk.fandm.edu/FLI/keystone/pdf/keymar08_1.pdf) (PDF) shows him trailing by 16 points. He essentially ties Clinton among men, trails badly among women, and doesn't even beat her among college graduates (usually a sweet spot for Obama). If there's a silver lining, it's that these numbers come from surveys done during Obama's worst week of press\u2014after the Rev. Jeremiah Wright's sermons rocketed around the media but before Obama gave his speech to try to clarify the matter. But even that silver lining has a cloud hanging over it: Eighty-five percent of Pennsylvanians say they're certain about their choice. Posted by Chadwick Matlin, March 20, 3:11 p.m. won candidate: Delegates won by each candidate: Source: CNN . . The Chinese government has [restricted foreign reporters from entering Tibet](http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/19/asia/AS-GEN-China-Tibet-Media.php), but amateur [photos](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/7296502.stm) and [videos of protesters](http://youtube.com/watch?v=J7NsnwB8TFQ) have found their way onto YouTube and various media sites outside the [Great Firewall](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200803/chinese-firewall). Is it possible to trace who took those pictures? Probably not, unless the owner registered the camera with the manufacturer. A little detective work can easily pinpoint the make and model of the camera that took them, but it would be hard to extract identifying information from the digital images themselves. Most JPEG files include pieces of information called metadata that cover everything from when the photo was taken to how long the exposure lasted. Manufacturers usually include the make and model of the camera as part of this information, but it's easy to delete or falsify these tags by using [editing software](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/digitalphotography/prophoto/photoinfo.mspx) like Photoshop. Listing the camera's serial number is less common, but, when available, this tidbit can be used to track down the country where the device was sold, or even, if there's a superb paper trail, the store. When the final Harry Potter novel was leaked online after a fan [photographed every single page](http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article2104250.ece) last summer, investigators gathered from the metadata that a Canon Rebel 350 was used to take the pictures. Some Canon models also automatically include the camera's serial number in the metadata, but it's not clear if the culprit was ever caught. Of course, if you've registered the device with the manufacturer, a photo's metadata can lead straight to you. It's harder to generalize about tracing cell-phone pictures, since manufacturers may choose to include less metadata because of space considerations. U.S. cellular plans make it a bit easier to connect phones with their owners, but this is less true in Asia, where people buy minutes of air time rather than subscription plans. If, however, the metadata on a photo includes a piece of information known as the [IMEI number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Equipment_Identity), it's theoretically possible to track down the camera phone while it is turned on, triangulate the position of the person carrying it to within a mile, then chase him down. Even if all the metadata has been erased, you can still uncover the camera's make and model. To do this, search the JPEG file for something called the [quantization table](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/tr06a.pdf). This series of numbers reflects the way the image has been compressed. Since manufacturers use different compression methods, a quantization table can narrow the field to a few camera models. (Something else that's also embedded into digital files from certain cameras: a thumbnail of the original photo. Even if you edit out faces from the photo, a low-resolution copy of the undoctored image will still be available.) If you have a lot of digital images (say, 100 photos or five minutes of video) and a suspected camera on hand, a process similar to handgun ballistics is an option. To prove that a particular camera took those photos, you'd need to examine the \"noise\" patterns in the pictures. Sensors aren't perfect, so each pixel of color contains tiny variations\u2014say, random colors when the whole pixel should be sky blue. If you tease out the noise from each photo and then average the noise to form a pattern, you may be able to match them to new photos from the camera. Got a question about today's news? [Ask Dartmouth Nasir of Polytechnic University. Barack Obama [rebuked his former pastor](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/03/18/obama-speech-rebuking-rev-wright/?mod=googlenews_wsj) the Rev. Jeremiah Wright on Tuesday for giving sermons in which he [blamed the government](http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/03/14/obamas-spiritual-adviser-questioned-us-role-in-spread-of-hiv-sept-11-attacks/) for creating a racist state and \"inventing the HIV virus as a means of genocide against people of color.\" Wright isn't the first to say that AIDS originated in the White House. Others have attributed the epidemic to a laboratory accident, malnutrition, or even God's divine will. Here's a field guide to the most prevalent conspiracy theories: Government Involvement The belief cited by Wright\u2014that the government invented HIV\u2014seems to have originated during the early years of the epidemic. In 1986, crackpot East German biologist Jakob Segal published \"AIDS: USA Home-Made Evil.\" According to the pamphlet, scientists at a Fort Detrick, Md., military lab manufactured the disease by synthesizing [HTLV-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_T-lymphotropic_virus) (a retrovirus that causes T-cell leukemia) with [Visna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visna_virus) (a sheep virus). The scientists administered their lethal concoction to prison inmates, who then introduced the disease into the general population. In case you're wondering, Segal has since been accused of being a Soviet disinformation agent. Similarly, the aptly named [Boyd E. Graves](http://www.boydgraves.com/) (who calls himself a doctor although he has only a law degree) has postulated that scientists in the employ of the U.S. Special Virus Program modified Visna to create HIV during the 1970s. The government, with help from pharmaceutical company [Merck](http://www.merck.com/), added the virus to an experimental hepatitis B vaccine, which was given to gay men and blacks in New York and San Francisco. And then there's Gary Glum, author of Full Disclosure, who fronts the theory that scientists at the Cold Spring Harbor lab in New York engineered HIV, and that the World Health Organization spread the virus under cover of the smallpox eradication program. Glum believes the virus was created to wipe out, or at least control, the black population. (According to a study released in 2005 by the [Rand Corp.](http://rand.org/news/press.05/01.25.html), more than one-quarter of African-Americans believe the disease was engineered in a government lab, and 16 percent think it was created to control the black population.) Laboratory Accident [Edward Hooper](http://www.aidsorigins.com/), a British journalist, argued in his 1999 book, [The River](http://www.amazon.com/River-Journey-Source-HIV-AIDS/dp/0316371378/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1205939883&sr=8-1), that [Dr. Hilary Koprowski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Koprowski) of the Wistar Research Institute unintentionally caused the AIDS epidemic by using chimp kidneys to produce an oral polio vaccine. The chimps, says Hooper, were infected with SIV (the simian precursor to AIDS). Then, via an experimental mass-vaccination program in the Belgian Congo, SIV made the jump from monkey to man. Hooper's contaminated polio vaccine thesis sounds less wacky than most conspiracy theories and has attracted support from a few notable academics\u2014including late Oxford professor W.D. Hamilton. But [it's definitely wrong](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v428/n6985/abs/428820a.html). Hooper says Koprowski got his kidney samples from chimps in the Congo. The problem is that the SIV strain endemic to chimps from that region is phylogenetically distinct from HIV. The offending chimps probably came from Cameroon. It's Not a Virus Among the most popular, and pernicious, conspiracy theories is that AIDS isn't caused by a virus at all. Peter Duesberg, a biology professor at University of California-Berkeley, has argued that drugs and promiscuity are the principal causes of the disease in the United States. He attributes AIDS in Africa to malnutrition. South African President [Thabo Mbeki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS_reappraisal#Impact_in_South_Africa) has voiced support for the so-called Duesberg hypothesis, and his health minister, [Mantombazana Tshabalala-Msimang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manto_Tshabalala-Msimang), has recommended treating AIDS with foodstuffs, like garlic, rather than pharmaceuticals.

The implosion of securities firm [Bear Stearns](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/17/business/17bear.html) over the weekend was a painful blow to an already turbulent market. Bear Stearns, which was founded in 1923 and had survived the Depression and [weathered a dozen recessions](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/BusinessCycles.html), was undone in large part by its investments in a financial commodity known as \"mortgage-backed securities.\" What are those, exactly? Mortgage-backed securities resemble bonds, instruments issued by governments and corporations that promise to pay a fixed amount of interest for a defined period of time. Mortgage-backed securities are created when a company such as Bear Stearns buys a bunch of mortgages from a primary lender\u2014that is, from the company you actually got your mortgage from\u2014and then uses your monthly payments, and those of thousands of others, as the revenue stream to pay investors who have bought chunks of the offering. They allow lenders to sell the mortgages they make, thus replenishing their coffers and allowing them to lend again. For their part, buyers of mortgage-backed securities take security in the knowledge that the value of the bond doesn't just rest on the creditworthiness of one borrower, but on the collective creditworthiness of a group of borrowers. In addition to creating mortgage-backed securities, Wall Street firms such as Bear Stearns also traded them. When the housing market is doing well and interest rates are low, investing in a mortgage-backed security is a fairly safe bet. So long as homeowners stay current with their payments, holders of mortgage-backed securities receive a stream of payments. Even those investors who buy lower-quality mortgage-backed securities, in the hopes of receiving higher interest payments, generally fare well in a bull market. But when the housing market goes south, or if interest rates rise, even the safest of these investments are in serious jeopardy. Rising interest rates reduce the value of securities that pay a fixed rate of interest. When borrowers default on mortgages, the stream of payments available to holders of mortgage-backed securities declines. And when a firm has borrowed heavily to finance the purchase and trading of such securities, it doesn't take much of a fall in value to trigger serious problems. The nationwide mortgage-default crisis has harshly punished many of the participants in the mortgage-backed-securities market. As subprime lenders failed, Wall Street firms such as Bear Stearns, which underwrote the issuance of such securities, saw their revenues fall. Hedge funds that traded mortgage-backed securities using lots of borrowed money suffered heavy losses as the value of the bonds fell. Last summer, two Bear Stearns hedge funds that specialized in mortgage-backed securities melted down, giving the firm a black eye. In recent months, as the market for mortgage-backed securities\u2014and for financial instruments based on them\u2014has seized up, large investment banks and hedge funds have been forced to write down the value of the mortgage-backed securities on their books, taking huge charges against earnings and scaring off other market participants from trading with them. Bad bets on mortgage-backed securities have contributed to a crisis in confidence at many of Wall Street's largest players, including Bear Stearns. Last week, Bear fell victim to a run on the bank, which had its origins in the firm's concentration in the mortgage-backed securities market. Rather than file for bankruptcy, Bear Stearns accepted a takeover bid from JPMorgan Chase for $2 a share. (A year ago, it traded at $150.) Analysts warn that other firms that invested so heavily in mortgage-backed securities may not be far behind. Got a question about today's news? [Ask the Explainer](mailto:ask_the_explainer@yahoo.com). The Warner Bros. cave man saga 10,000 B.C. [raked in more than $35 million](http://www.cfrb.com/news/55/681003/'10,000+b.c.'+tops+weekend+box+office+with+$35.9+million) on its first weekend. The film tells an action-packed love story set against a prehistoric backdrop that includes everything from woolly mammoths and saber-toothed tigers to pyramids and written language. Did all of these things exist at the same time? No. The woolly mammoth and the saber-toothed tiger might have survived as late as 10,000 B.C., although they [went extinct fairly abruptly](http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/larson/lp_extinction.html) right around that time, give or take a millennium. On the [geologic timescale](http://anthropology.si.edu/humanorigins/faq/gt/gt_scale.html), this date marks the end of the [Pleistocene Epoch](http://anthropology.si.edu/humanorigins/faq/gt/cenozoic/pleistocene.htm), which we know colloquially as the Ice Age, a period of nearly 2 million years that saw the rapid expansion of Homo sapiens across the planet. Some paleontologists blame excessive hunting by humans for the extinction of these species, though the number of mammoth fossils that show evidence of having been killed by man-made weapons\u2014usually stone spears\u2014is fairly small. Others suggest that [disease or climate changes](http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A12894-2001Nov11) wiped them out. Whatever the cause, the mammoth-hunting hero of 10,000 B.C. is practicing a dying art. Other predators in the film, such as the giant, flightless, carnivorous birds, were [already extinct by this time](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6313741.stm), though they were once thought to have survived up to around the end of the Pleistocene, most numerously in the Americas. In the film, the mammoths travel in herds and disperse when the lead male gets spooked. We don't know much about the behavior patterns of extinct animals, but experts generally believe that these movie-star mammoths get it all backward. If you can trust inferences drawn from elephants (close cousins of the mammoths), herds would have been led by the oldest female, and the bulls would have been expelled at puberty. Geologists at the University of Michigan have pioneered a field of study known as \" [tuskology](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/11/1122_051122_mammoth.html),\" by which a mammoth's diet and birth patterns can be determined based on its accumulation of ivory. According to these measurements, mammoth herds appear to have expelled males at around the same time that elephants do. While it's plausible that humans would be hunting mammoths in 10,000 B.C., the film runs awry when it mixes in elements of more advanced civilization. The pyramidlike monuments, codified language, and organized society that show up later in the story wouldn't have been around until about 3,000 B.C., with the urbanization of the regions surrounding the Euphrates, the Nile, and the Indus rivers, and possibly the [steppes of Russia](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070802182042.htm). We also know that humans weren't growing their own food in any organized way until approximately 9,400 B.C. [at the very earliest](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/02/science/02fig.html); the hero of 10,000 B.C. studies a wooden hoe and learns how to plant seedlings from what appears to be an African tribe. There is evidence of early stone monuments from around that time, like a mountain sanctuary in southeastern Turkey called [G\u00f6bekli Tepe](http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14968), dating to approximately 9,000 B.C. But most of the technology in the movie\u2014particularly the metal tools and weapons\u2014is way out of place. The movie's title places the action solidly in the Stone Age; bronze and iron tools don't appear [for several millenniums](http://neon.mems.cmu.edu/cramb/Processing/history.html). Other inventions appearing in the film, like the sextant, are even further off. The sextant was not invented until A.D. 1731, though the ancient Egyptians did have a rudimentary knowledge of astronomy that allowed them to navigate and align their structures.

Easter Sunday represents the foundational claim of Christian faith, the highest day of the Christian year as celebration of Jesus' resurrection. But many Christians are unsure what the claim that Jesus had been raised to new life after being crucified actually means\u2014while non-Christians often find the whole idea of resurrection bemusing and even ridiculous. These differences over what Jesus' resurrection represents and discomfort with the whole idea are nothing new, however: Christians in the first few centuries also had difficulty embracing the idea of a real, bodily resurrection. Then, as now, resurrection was not the favored post-death existence\u2014people much preferred to think that after dying, souls headed to some ethereal realm of light and tranquillity. During the Roman period, many regarded the body as a pitiful thing at best and at worst a real drag upon the soul, even a kind of prison from which the soul was liberated at death. So, it's not surprising that there were Christians who simply found bodily resurrection stupid and repugnant. To make the idea palatable, they instead interpreted all references to Jesus' resurrection in strictly spiritual terms. Some thought of Jesus as having shed his earthly body in his death, assuming a purely spiritual state, and returning to his original status in the divine realm. In other cases, Jesus' earthly body and his death were even seen as illusory, the divine Christ merely appearing to have a normal body (rather like Clark Kent!). The idea of a real, personal resurrection\u2014meaning a new bodily existence of individuals after death, in one way or another\u2014did not originate with Christianity or with claims about Jesus. Instead, it seems to be first clearly reflected in Jewish texts dated to sometime in the second century B.C., such as the biblical book of Daniel 12:2. At the time, it was a genuinely innovative idea. (Alan Segal's book [Life After Death](http://www.amazon.com/Life-After-Death-Afterlife-Religion/dp/0385422997) gives an expansive discussion of the origins of the idea of resurrection.) Many peoples of the ancient world hoped for one or another sort of eternal life, but it was usually thought of as a kind of bodiless existence of soul or spirit set in realms of the dead that might or might not be happy, pleasant places. In still other expectations, death might bring a merging of individuals with some ocean of being, like a drop of water falling into the sea. The ancient Jewish and early Christian idea of personal resurrection represented a new emphasis on individuals and the importance of embodied existence beyond the mere survival or enhancement of the soul, although there was debate about the precise nature of the post-resurrection body. Some seem to have supposed it would be a new body of flesh and bones, closely linked to the corpse in the grave but not liable to decay or death. Others imagined a body more like that of an angel. But whatever its precise nature, the hope of resurrection reflected a strongly holistic view of the person as requiring some sort of body to be complete. With ancient Jews, early Christians saw resurrection as an act of God, a divine gift of radically new life, not an expression of some inherent immortality of the soul. That is, the dead don't rise by themselves; they are raised by God and will experience resurrection collectively as one of the events that comprise God's future redemption of the world and vindication of the righteous. In the ancient Judaism of Jesus' time, however, resurrection was not universally affirmed. Some devout Jews (particularly the religious party called [Sadducees](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=40&letter=S)) apparently considered the whole idea ridiculous, as evidenced by the New Testament, which gives us some of the most direct references to disputes among ancient Jews about the matter. In [Mark 12:18-27](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12:18-27), Sadducees taunt Jesus with a question about a woman married several times, asking him whose wife she will be following the resurrection. Jesus strongly affirms resurrection, but he insists that those resurrected will not marry and portrays the Sadducees' question as reflecting a foolish ignorance of God's power. In the earliest expressions of their faith that we have, Christians claimed that Jesus' resurrection showed that God singled out Jesus ahead of the future resurrection of the dead to show him uniquely worthy to be lord of all the elect. However, the paradigmatic significance of Jesus' resurrection was also very important for early Christians. In Christianity's first few centuries, when believers often suffered severe persecution and even the threat of death, those who believed in Jesus' bodily resurrection found it particularly meaningful for their own circumstances. Jesus had been put to death in grisly fashion, but God had overturned Jesus' execution and, indeed, had given him a new and glorious body. So, they believed that they could face their own deaths as well as those of their loved ones in the firm hope that God would be faithful to them as well. They thought that they would share the same sort of immortal reaffirmation of their personal and bodily selves that Jesus had experienced. Elaine Pagels, a scholar of early Christianity, has argued that those Christians who regarded the body as unimportant, perhaps including \" [Gnostics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism),\" were less willing to face martyrdom for their faith and more willing to make gestures of acquiescence to the Romans\u2014for example, by offering sacrifices to Roman gods\u2014because they regarded actions done with their bodies as insignificant so long as in their hearts they held to their beliefs. By contrast, Christians who believed in bodily resurrection seem to have regarded their own mortal coils as the crucial venues in which they were to live out their devotion to Christ. When these Christians were arraigned for their faith, they considered it genuine apostasy to give in to the gestures demanded by the Roman authorities. For them, inner devotion to Jesus had to be expressed in an outward faithfulness in their bodies\u2014and they were ready to face martyrdom for their faith, encouraged by the prospect of bodily resurrection. Indeed, Christian martyrs are pictured as engaged in a battle with the Roman authorities (and the Devil, whom Christians saw as behind Roman malevolence toward them), with the martyrs' bodies as battlegrounds in which the integrity of their person and their personal salvation could be lost or retained. Historically, then, how Christians have understood Jesus' \"resurrection\" says a lot about how they have understood themselves, whether they have a holistic view of the human person, whether they see bodily existence as trivial or crucial, and how they imagine full salvation to be manifested. Does salvation comprise a deliverance from the body into some sort of immediate and permanent postmortem bliss (which is actually much closer to popular Christian piety down the centuries), or does salvation require a new embodiment of some sort, a more robust reaffirmation of persons? This sort of question originally was integral to early Jewish and Christian belief in the resurrection. In all the varieties of early Christianity, and in all the various understandings of what his \"resurrection\" meant, Jesus was typically the model, the crucial paradigm for believers, what had happened to him seen as prototypical of what believers were to hope for themselves. Sending out hundreds of Easter cards this year? Attending way too many Easter parties? Doing some last-minute shopping for gifts to place under your Easter tree? Getting tired of those endless Easter-themed specials on television? I didn't think so. Unlike Christmas, whose deeper spiritual meaning has been all but buried under an annual avalanche of commercialism, Easter has retained a stubborn hold on its identity as a religious holiday. This is all the more surprising when you consider what an opportune time it would be for marketers to convince us to buy more stuff. Typically arriving around the beginning of spring, Easter would be the perfect time for department stores to euchre customers into buying carloads of kids' outdoor toys, warm-weather clothes, and summertime sporting equipment. And while Christmas is forced to contend with Thanksgiving, New Year's Day, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa, there is little holiday competition around Easter time. (Passover and Easter, despite their proximity in the calendar, don't seem to [interfere with each other](http://www.slate.com/id/2162993/) much.) All in all, the church's most important feast day comes at a terrific time of year for Madison Avenue. So what enables Easter to maintain its religious purity and not devolve into the consumerist nightmare that is Christmas? Well, for one thing, it's hard to make a palatable consumerist holiday out of Easter when its back story is, at least in part, so gruesome. Christmas is cuddly. Easter, despite the bunnies, is not. To the secular mind, the story of Christmas goes like this: A young couple named Mary (pretty, pregnant, wearing a flattering blue gown) and Joseph (a little older, quite handsome, sporting a well-trimmed beard) journeyed on a trusty donkey all the way to O Little Town of Bethlehem. Since there was no room at the inn, the young couple bunked in a cozy stable filled with cuddly farm animals. There, Away in the Manger, Mary gave birth to Jesus, her adorable baby boy. Soon after, Angels We Have Heard on High came to the rustic shepherds to tell them What Child Is This. And then We Three Kings of Orient Are\u2014or, rather, showed up. Despite the awesome theological implications (Christians believe that the infant lying in the manger is the son of God), the Christmas story is easily reduced to pablum. How pleasant it is in mid-December to open a Christmas card with a pretty picture of Mary and Joseph gazing beatifically at their son, with the shepherds and the angels beaming in delight. The Christmas story, with its friendly resonances of marriage, family, babies, animals, angels, and\u2014thanks to the wise men\u2014gifts, is eminently marketable to popular culture. It's a Thomas Kinkade painting come to life. On the other hand, a card bearing the image of a near-naked man being stripped, beaten, tortured, and nailed through his hands and feet onto a wooden crucifix is a markedly less pleasant piece of mail. The Easter story is relentlessly disconcerting and, in a way, is the antithesis of the Christmas story. No matter how much you try to water down its particulars, Easter retains some of the shock it had for those who first participated in the events during the first century. The man who spent the final three years of his life preaching a message of love and forgiveness (and, along the way, healing the sick and raising the dead) is betrayed by one of his closest friends, turned over to the representatives of a brutal occupying power, and is tortured, mocked, and executed in the manner that Rome reserved for the worst of its criminals. We may even sense resonances with some painful political issues still before us. Jesus of Nazareth was not only physically brutalized but also casually humiliated during his torture, echoing the abuses at Abu Ghraib. In 21st-century Iraq, some American soldiers posed prisoners with women's underwear on their heads as a way of scorning their manhood. In first-century Palestine, some Roman soldiers pressed down a crown of thorns onto Jesus' head and clothed him in a purple robe to scorn the kingship his followers claimed for him. After this, Jesus suffered the most degrading of all Roman deaths: crucifixion. Jesus remains the world's most famous victim of capital punishment. To his followers, therefore, his execution was not only tragic and terrifying but shameful. It is difficult not to wonder what the Apostles would have thought of a crucifix as a [fashion accessory](http://www.sourcingmap.com/cross-necklace-c-984_1581.html). Imagine wearing an image of a hooded Abu Ghraib victim around your neck as holiday bling. Even the resurrection, the joyful end of the Easter story, resists domestication as it resists banalization. Unlike Christmas, it also resists a noncommittal response. Even agnostics and atheists who don't accept Christ's divinity can accept the general outlines of the Christmas story with little danger to their worldview. But Easter demands a response. It's hard for a non-Christian believer to say, \"Yes, I believe that Jesus of Nazareth was crucified, died, was buried, and rose from the dead.\" That's not something you can believe without some serious ramifications: If you believe that Jesus rose from the dead, this has profound implications for your spiritual and religious life\u2014really, for your whole life. If you believe the story, then you believe that Jesus is God, or at least God's son. What he says about the world and the way we live in that world then has a real claim on you. Easter is an event that demands a \"yes\" or a \"no.\" There is no \"whatever.\" More shocking than the crucifixion is the resurrection. Two thousand years later, it's still impossible for humanity to grasp this event fully. Even the Gospel writers found it hard to agree on what, precisely, happened and differ on something as basic as what Jesus looked like after the resurrection. (In some Gospel accounts, Jesus is almost ghostlike; in others, he is clearly a physical presence.) That confusion may be one reason why in most \"Jesus movies\" the resurrection is largely an afterthought. In Franco Zeffirelli's 1977 miniseries [Jesus of Nazareth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075520/) (an Easter TV favorite), the resurrection consists of Jesus uttering bland pieties to a dazed-looking group of apostles. In Mel Gibson's 2004 [The Passion of the Christ](http://www.slate.com/id/2095946/entry/2096184/) (admittedly about the crucifixion and death), the resurrection, something with far more religious import than the suffering, is reduced to a brief coda. In Gibson's version, Jesus stands up and marches out of his tomb on Easter morning to the strains of martial music, as if to say, \"I'm back, and I'm going to kick some Roman butt!\" What does the world do with a person who has been raised from the dead? Christians have been meditating on that for two millenniums. But despite the eggs, the baskets, and the bunnies, one thing we haven't been able to do is to tame that person, tame his message, and, moreover, tame what happened to him in Jerusalem all those years ago. That's one reason why you don't see many Easter cards, Easter gifts, and Easter decorations; why the stores aren't clogged with shoppers during Lent; and why the holiday is still, essentially, religious. Lent is a sober season, and no Christian ritual associated with the 40-day run-up to Easter is more sobering than the Stations of the Cross. The traditional devotion, often performed on Good Friday, is a sequence of prayers and meditations that recall events on Jesus' path to crucifixion and burial. The scenes of Jesus' final tribulations are heavy with suffering, betrayal, and torture, but they also communicate the central Christian paradox of new life through death. \"By your holy cross, you have redeemed the world,\" worshippers repeat as the service progresses from station to station. This year in time for Lent, [Episcopal Relief and Development](http://www.er-d.org/), the relief agency of the Episcopal Church, began offering a variation on the Stations of the Cross called the [Stations of the Millennium Development Goals](http://www.er-d.org/documents/stations_of_the_millennium_development_goals_liturgy.doc). It features eight stations, one for each of the global priorities identified by the United Nations in 2000, from eradicating poverty to promoting gender equality. Where each of the 14 stations of the traditional Stations of the Cross represents an event leading up to Jesus' death\u2014\"Jesus is condemned to death\" and \"Jesus falls the first time,\" for example\u2014the alternative version, promoted by Episcopal Relief and Development, shifts the focus to righting global problems. At Station 8, \"Create a Global Partnership for Development,\" participants are reminded that a \"fair trading system, increased international aid, and debt relief for developing countries will help us realize\" the U.N. goals. An optional activity at Station 7, \"Ensure Environmental Sustainability,\" asks that \"pilgrims calculate their carbon footprint and come up with three strategies to reduce it.\" When word of the new version spread online, the response from some liturgical traditionalists was harsh. \"Raw idolatry,\" one commenter wrote on the Anglican blog [Stand Firm](http://standfirminfaith.com/index.php/site/article/9393/). \"Is there any way this is not mortal sin?\" asked another at the conservative discussion site [Free Republic](http://freerepublic.com/focus/f-religion/1981515/posts?page=32). \"It runs the risk of replacing Christ with the church, and the activity of Christ with the activity of the church,\" Kendall Harmon, canon theologian of the Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina, was quoted as saying in a [story](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/marchweb-only/110-42.0.html) on the Web site of the magazine Christianity Today. For these critics, the problem with the alternative set of stations is that it doesn't talk about the Passion. Instead of Jesus' suffering, death, and resurrection, they say, the Millennium Development Goals liturgy focuses on global activism. No doubt, the Stations of the Millennium Development Goals depart from old-school worship traditions in some obvious ways. (A suggested activity for Station 4, on reducing child mortality, calls for participants to shade in drawings of children's faces, coloring-book-style.) But what the new liturgy's critics mostly failed to note was that the Stations of the Cross devotion has long been a changeable ritual. The number and nature of the stations has varied over time and across faith traditions. The devotion is usually associated with Catholicism, but some liturgically oriented Protestant congregations practice it, too, and the Anglican Book of Occasional Services features a Stations of the Cross liturgy. The menu of variations on the basic stations ritual is remarkably broad: There are children's stations, [online stations](http://www.uga.edu/cc/stations/stations.html), and stations performed on city streets with [worshippers dressed as Jesus and Roman soldiers](http://sobs.org/chilocal/viacrucis/viacrucisindex.html). The custom grew out of pilgrimages early Christians made to the Holy Land to retrace Jesus' path to Calvary. During the 15th century, to accommodate those who could not travel to Jerusalem, European artists began creating small shrines depicting the scenes of Jesus' Passion and placing them along local procession routes so that pilgrims could stop and pray at each one. The stations didn't move inside churches until the end of the 17th century, and it was only in 1731 that Pope Clement XII set the number of stations at 14. Before then, the number of events represented by stations varied widely, from as few as seven or eight to as many as 31. Even after the number of stations was settled on officially, some worshippers kept a 15th station for Jesus' resurrection. In 1991, Pope John Paul II made his own revision, introducing an [alternative version](http://www.usccb.org/nab/stations.htm) that eliminates the events not mentioned in Gospel accounts (Jesus' falls and Veronica's intervention with her veil, for example) and replaces them with others based on Scripture. The idea of tying the stations to social activism isn't even all that novel. Via Crucis re-enactments, like the one by [Catholics in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood](http://www.catholiccitizens.org/platform/platformview.asp?c=23959) where costumed churchgoers play the roles of Jesus and other figures in the Passion, include stops that call attention to social problems or injustices. One year, the Chicago procession stopped in front of a neighborhood tortilleria to pray for employees working in unsanitary conditions. Online, you can find homegrown Stations of the Cross [devotions](http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/mar2001/feature2.asp) that stop to pray at neighborhood sites like parks or at the scenes of fatal car accidents. But by taking Jesus' Passion out of play altogether, the Millennium Development Goals liturgy is a greater departure than any of these other alternative versions. So, what's the point of stations without the cross? The people at Episcopal Relief and Development who distributed the new liturgy insist that their alternative version was intended to complement, not replace, the traditional stations. They say the service would not be a good choice for Good Friday. And, they add, their cause is a good one: Meeting the Millennium Development Goals is an institutional priority of the Episcopal Church. Certainly some of the criticism of the liturgy can be written off as more of the usual sniping by liturgical traditionalists at social activists, part of the ongoing [division among Anglicans](http://www.slate.com/id/2093811/). And\u2014also as usual\u2014there was plenty of more-pious-than-thou posturing on display. One of the perils of defending old-style \"smells and bells\" worship is that you may find yourself on the same team with the kind of blog posters who take it upon themselves to accuse others of mortal sin. But even allowing for these stipulations and noting the worthiness of the Millennium Development Goals themselves, the liturgy strikes a disconcerting note. Part of the problem is the suggested activities, some of which smack of grade-school art assignments. (Finger paints?) Then there's the language, which too often slides into the bland agreeability of the corporate mission statement. (\"Clean water, sanitation, and development can work together to save lives and create productive, thriving societies and safeguard our planet.\") The value of liturgy lies in its ability to unite people around powerful ritual moments. But the Stations of the Millennium Development Goals appropriate the form of the old-school Stations of the Cross service without retaining the sense of sacred mystery that makes it so powerful. That's no sin\u2014but it is a bit of a shame. Cell-phone photographs and videos from Tibet, blurry and amateur, are circulating on the Internet. Some show clouds of tear gas; others burning buildings and shops; still others [purple-robed monks, riot police, and confusion](http://youtube.com/watch?v=J7NsnwB8TFQ). Watching them, it is impossible not to remember the cell-phone videos and [photographs sent out from burning Rangoon](http://english.dvb.no/photo1.php) only six months ago. Last year Burma, this year Tibet. Next year, will YouTube feature shops burning in Xinjiang, home of [China's Uighur minority](http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2005/04/11/china10447.htm)? Or riot police rounding up refugees along the [Chinese-North Korean border](http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2004/03/08/nkorea8076.htm)? That covert cell phones have become the most important means of transmitting news from certain parts of East Asia is no accident. Lhasa, Rangoon, Xinjiang, and North Korea: All of these places are, directly or indirectly, dominated by the same media-shy, publicity-sensitive Chinese regime. Though we don't usually think of it this way, China is, in fact, a vast, anachronistic, territorial empire, within which one dominant ethnic group, the Han Chinese, rules over a host of reluctant \"captive nations.\" To keep the peace, the Chinese use methods not so different from those once used by Austro-Hungary or czarist Russia: political manipulation, secret police repression, and military force. But, then, modern China bears many surprising resemblances to the empires of the past in other ways, too. Like its Soviet imperial predecessor, for example, China encompasses both an \"inner\" empire, of which Tibet and Xinjiang are the most prominent components, and an \"outer\" empire, consisting most notably of its Burmese and North Korean clients. Like its French and British predecessors, the Chinese empire must wrestle constantly with nations whose languages, religions, and customs differ sharply from its own and whose behavior is, therefore, unpredictable. And like all its predecessors, the Chinese imperial class cares deeply about the pacification of the imperial periphery, more so than one might think. For proof that this is so, look no further than the [biography of Hu Jintao](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2404129.stm), the current Chinese president\u2014and also the former Communist Party boss of Tibet. In 1988 and 1989, at the time of the last major riots, Hu was responsible both for the brutal repression of dissident Tibetan monks and dissidents and for what the Dalai Lama has subsequently called China's policy of \" [cultural genocide](http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/16/tibet.unrest/index.html?eref=rss_topstories:)\": the importation of thousands of ethnic Han Chinese into Tibet's cities in order to dilute and eventually outbreed the ethnic Tibetan population. Clearly, the repression of Tibet matters enormously to the members of China's ruling clique, or they would not have promoted Hu, its mastermind, so far. The pacification of Tibet must also be considered a major political and propaganda success, or it would not have been copied by the Chinese-backed Burmese regime last year and repeated by the Chinese themselves in Tibet last week. Tibet is to China what Algeria once was to France, what India once was to imperial Britain, what Poland was to czarist Russia: the most unreliable, the most intransigent, and at the same time the most symbolically significant province of the empire. Keep that in mind, over the next few days and months, as China tries once again to belittle Tibet, to explain away a nationalist uprising as a bit of vandalism. The last week's riots began as a religious protest: Tibet's monks were demonstrating against laws that, among other things, require them to renounce the dalai lama. The monks' marches then escalated into generalized, unplanned, anti-Chinese violence, culminating in attacks on Han Chinese shops and businesses, among them\u2014as you can see on the cell-phone videos\u2014the Lhasa branch of the Bank of China. However the official version evolves, in other words, make no mistake about it: This was not merely vandalism, it could not have been solely organized by outsiders, it was not only about the Olympics, and it was not the work of a tiny minority. It was a significant political event, proof that the Tibetans still identify themselves as Tibetan, not Chinese. As such, it must have significant reverberations in Beijing. The war in Algeria brought down the French Fourth Republic. The dissident movements on its periphery helped weaken the Soviet Union. Right now, I'd wager that Hu Jintao's Tibet policy is causing a lot of consternation among his colleagues. And if they aren't worried, they should be. After all, the history of the last two centuries is filled with tales of strong, stable empires brought down by their subjects, undermined by their client states, overwhelmed by the national aspirations of small, subordinate countries. Why should the 21st century be any different? Watching the tear gas roll over the streets of Lhasa yesterday on a blurry, cell-phone video, I couldn't help but wonder when\u2014maybe not in this decade, this generation, or even this century\u2014Tibet and its monks will have their revenge. The annual [Game Developers Conference](http://www.gdconf.com/) is a chance for all the major players in the video-game industry to show off their flashiest new titles. Attendees at February's meeting, for instance, were treated to a sneak peek of the upcoming [Gears of War II](http://youtube.com/watch?v=-m4pe6UAS2M), a richly detailed sci-fi action game that appears indistinguishable from a blockbuster sci-fi movie. The game has subtle lighting and shadow effects, water that ripples and splashes properly, concrete walls that crack and crumble to reveal the underlying rebar. To top it all off, the guy leading the demo had his character pump bullets into an enormous cube of meat, which was authentically elastic and viscous in response to the fusillade. Despite that absurd graphical overkill, or maybe because of it, Gears of War II wasn't the talk of the show. Most of the chatter was about a game called Crayon Physics Deluxe, which didn't get a glitzy demo on a huge video screen in front of an audience of thousands. Why all the love for a game that looks a bit like something your third-grader might ask you to stick up on the fridge? Watch the embedded video below, and you'll understand. Pretty awesome, huh? Crayon Physics Deluxe lets you draw objects on the screen by clicking and dragging your mouse, or by drawing with the stylus of a tablet PC, as in this video. The objects you scrawl become part of the game world. The goal is to create objects that propel a crudely drawn ball toward a crudely drawn star. There is no single correct way to scoot that ball around; the fun is in exploring the options. Within seconds of hitting start, you're furiously scribbling blocks and ramps and wedges and seesaws, whatever it takes to reach the goal. Some players may get sidetracked creating hilariously inefficient Rube Goldberg devices. Others will forget the objectives altogether and just draw. (If you want to try it yourself, you can download a simpler demo version of the game [here](http://www.kloonigames.com/blog/games/crayon).) This unassuming drawing game didn't get the same huge demo treatment as Gears of War II. Crayon Physics Deluxe was part of the Independent Games Festival that's connected to the Game Developers Conference. The Independent Games Festival has been part of the conference for a decade, but there was a general sense this year that the little guys had finally outclassed the big boys. Fast Internet-connection speeds make it easy for anyone to offer the game for download, and there's a huge built-in online audience for simple, time-wasting \"casual games.\" There are millions of gamers out there who don't want a big, polished game that comes in a box. They want something they can launch this second and play while killing time on a conference call. All the big game publishers are getting wise to this market\u2014Electronic Arts just announced an EA Casual Games Division late last year. But the best casual games on display at the conference were still made by tiny teams with no corporate backing, rebellious garage coders who prefer to term their work \"indie,\" like indie rock or indie film. Gears of War II will take several years, hundreds of people, and tens of millions of dollars to create. Crayon Physics Deluxe was made by Petri Purho, a 24-year-old student at Helsinki Polytechnic. He makes games at the rate of about one a month and offers them as free, PC-only downloads on [his personal site](http://www.kloonigames.com/blog/). Purho says his hobby was inspired by the [Experimental Gameplay Project](http://www.experimentalgameplay.com/), the equivalent of Dogme 95 for indie game makers. The tenets of EGP are: The notion of a single theme is important. Most major games these days are fixated on building entire worlds. The developers kill themselves to make realistic-looking humans, a realistic-looking environment, realistic physics, etc. The constraints of EGP, however, liberate indie game makers to focus on making a single facet of their game as unique and original as possible. \"And if the game turns out be complete crap, I have only wasted a week,\" Purho writes on his site. Some of his rapidly prototyped games are ... well, complete crap. [Daydreaming in the Oval Office](http://www.kloonigames.com/blog/games/ovaloffice) casts you as a cartoony George W. Bush gathering bits of \"imaginary pieces of evidence about the Iraq's weapons of mass destruction\" while simultaneously trying to keep a globe aloft like a beach ball at a rock concert. The political commentary is a bit trite, and the game isn't much fun to play. Purho himself concedes that this particular game is \"as incompetent as its main character.\" But many of his experiments are wickedly funny and original. There are many games based on the exploits of Indiana Jones, but [Purho's version](http://www.kloonigames.com/blog/games/boulder) is the only one that tells the story from the boulder's point of view, letting players control the rampaging sphere and smoosh wave after wave of attacking archeologists. Another game, [Grammar Nazi](http://www.kloonigames.com/blog/games/grammar), is a literate twist on shooters like Space Invaders. Players fire upward at swarms of enemies, but the ammo in Purho's version is the letters you type on the keyboard, and the longer the words you spell, the more damage they do. (Tapping out indie has some impact. Autodidact causes a massive explosion.) Purho made it in a single day. The original version of Crayon Physics was the Finnish student's 10th rapid-prototype project. It was inspired by the descriptions he'd heard of the classic children's book [Harold and the Purple Crayon](http://youtube.com/watch?v=c6TXz38DzDY). Purho coded it in five days and posted it on his site in June 2007. The game won instant acclaim, inspiring him to release a level editor a few weeks later so others could create their own layouts and obstacles. The game proved such a success that Purho chose to violate his one-week rule to create Crayon Physics Deluxe. The months of extra time that went into this fleshed-out version make for a more polished experience, with better re-creations of the player's scrawlings. In the original version, your drawings were automatically squared off; the new version maintains the cruddy imperfections of your line art. Purho plans to charge $20 for the deluxe version once he finishes. Despite his obvious talent, Purho isn't sure he wants to go into the industry after he gets his computer-science degree. \"It's more about writing documents than it is about designing games,\" he says. \"And I really hate writing documents.\" Purho will probably have a better chance of moving the industry forward if he keeps flying solo. As the titles on display at this year's Independent Games Festival proved, some of the most innovative products in the gaming world are coming from one-man outfits. Take [Audiosurf](http://www.audio-surf.com/), made by another game-a-week geek, Dylan Fitterer (with help from his wife, Elizabeth). The game is based on a simple, ingenious concept: transform your favorite music into a game. Audiosurf takes any music file from your computer and [turns it into a level](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQKdNtf9GHs). While listening to the track, you steer a little rocket car back and forth to collect the beats as they whiz past and avoid others. It's the perfect way to kill five minutes, and it's currently one of the best-selling titles on the [Steam](http://www.steampowered.com/) downloadable-games service, where it competes with photorealistic shooters in the same vein as Gears of War II. While Audiosurf had its partisans, the Seamus McNally Grand Prize\u2014the indie-game equivalent of the Academy Award for best picture\u2014went to Crayon Physics Deluxe. (Disclosure: I was one of more than 40 judges who voted on the entries.) The crowd whooped and roared as Purho took the stage. His acceptance speech was as clever and succinct as his game. He held up [a piece of paper with a crayon scribble](http://www.kloonigames.com/blog/general/fck-yeah). It had two simple words: \"F--k Yeah.\" Sordid [details](): As expected, Paramount chief Brad Grey's testimony at the Pellicano trial was not too sexy. Garry Shandling may have gotten people's hopes up with his complaints about Grey's behavior as his manager, but no one in this case has a stake in pursuing that angle. The question was whether Grey knew of Pellicano's alleged wrongdoing, and Grey, naturally, said he did not. So it's hardly surprising that Shandling\u2014a professional, after all\u2014turned out to be more entertaining than Grey. For those looking for a big takedown of Hollywood power, it's long been clear that the trial seems unlikely to pay off. But the fact that Pellicano's big-name clients appear to have skated doesn't mean that the allegations in this case aren't sensational. They could hardly be more so. If the government's got its facts right (and Pellicano, acting as his own counsel, isn't mounting a serious defense so far), then the worst is true: Justice in this country can be bought pretty easily, if not cheaply. The case has elicited testimony that Pellicano convinced cops and phone company employees to snoop through data that should have had vigilant protection. He perverted the system, and not just to benefit rich clients who wanted to shake off unwanted spouses or thwart opponents in business deals. He is accused of having successfully intimidated a number of alleged rape victims to prevent their testifying against a client. Got that? He helped an alleged serial rapist get off the hook. And he got away with it all for years. For a long time, Pellicano's tough-guy talk seemed to put him on the verge of self-parody: the hard-boiled gumshoe playing the private-dick role in the manner that people in Hollywood would expect. And in many cases, his alleged victims were hard to pity\u2014like producer Bo Zenga, who had to take the Fifth more than 100 times when he was deposed in a lawsuit that he had initiated. (Zenga has also declared himself an award-winning screenwriter when all he had \"won\" was a contest that he'd made up himself.) Then there was Lisa Bonder, who tried to shake down Kirk Kerkorian for $320,000 a month after gaming a DNA test to trick him into supporting a child who wasn't his. It was hard to feel bad when Pellicano exposed that type of behavior. But even if all of Pellicano's victims had put themselves in harm's way, what he appears to have done goes far beyond their concerns. Every day of testimony sharpens the focus on allegations that should scare everyone\u2014even folks who have never gotten closer to Hollywood than the multiplex. ( [link](#Sordid)) March 17, 2008 [Oink](): The trial of private detective to the stars Anthony Pellicano perked up a bit last Thursday with Garry Shandling swearing under oath that his former manager Brad Grey was, in essence, a pig. Shandling already said that in a lawsuit filed in 1998, in which he complained that Grey overdid it by cutting himself in as a producer of Shandling's television show, taking ownership of half the show, and giving himself commissions on Shandling's work as a writer and actor. Whether this meets the legal definition of piggishness is unclear since the suit was settled. So Shandling never testified about his grievances until now. And, of course, Grey at this point is running Paramount, so Shandling's grievances have a fresh resonance. Grey felt moved to issue a statement that he was \"extremely saddened\" by Shandling's allegations and said that he remembered the facts differently, though he offered no specifics. Once Shandling sued, he said, he was forced to hire Bert Fields. So his (very profitable) \"friendship\" with Shandling was \"overtaken by a legal process that was directed by lawyers.\" Translation: Bert Fields hired Pellicano\u2014not me\u2014and who knew about any wiretapping? All the big-name players who were Pellicano fans\u2014Brad Grey, Michael Ovitz\u2014have declared themselves to be shocked at allegations that Pellicano had a ring of on-the-take cops and phone-company employees to assist him in eavesdropping and perpetrating other schemes on their behalf. The Los Angeles Times has quoted Ovitz's attorney as stating that \"neither Mr. Ovitz nor [his company] authorized or had any knowledge\" of snooping or other activities performed with Ovitz's interests in mind. The Pellicano trial prompted a producer we know to reminisce about the days when Ovitz was the most powerful man in Hollywood. \"Remember how Ovitz always used to ask if you were on a hard line when you talked to him on the phone?\" he asked. \"And we all thought he was being paranoid!\" But now, it seems just possible that Ovitz suspected something. For us, the trial brings back a memory from the days in the mid-'90s when Hollywoodland was toiling on a book (Hit & Run: How Jon Peters and Peter Guber Took Sony for a Ride in Hollywood, with partner Nancy Griffin). We knew about Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss and her links to various film executives in our book. But none of this was public yet\u2014no one had ever heard of Heidi Fleiss\u2014and we were trying to figure out how to get these interesting facts on the record. At one point, Hollywoodland asked one of the major players whose named has arisen in the Pellicano case if he knew of Fleiss, watching carefully what his face revealed. (If the conversation had been on the record, we'd tell you who it was.) He said he'd never heard of her, but he gave us some advice: If we wanted to learn more, he said, look at the phone records. We were confused. We did not have subpoena power. How could we get phone records? \"There are ways,\" he assured us with a knowing smile. This makes it hard to believe that all the Pellicano clients were as ignorant of his activities as they claim. But apparently evidence is lacking. Eliot Spitzer may have been nailed with lightning speed thanks to wiretapped conversations. But Ovitz, Grey, and Fields were apparently innocent dupes\u2014and are presumably extremely saddened to learn of any acts of thuggery perpetrated on their behalf. ( [link](#oink)) March 14, 2008 [It's ]()Fun To Have Fun: Your Hollywoodland correspondent attended the glamorous premiere of Horton Hears a Who! last Saturday and was present when protesters started yelling shortly after Horton uttered his famous motto: \"A person's a person, no matter how small.\" We could not understand what was being shouted and thought perhaps that Seth Rogen or one of the other many vocal talents in the film was expressing love for Dr. Seuss' elephant and his signature line. But as you may have read elsewhere, anti-abortion activists had infiltrated the theater. Afterward, they handed out fliers designed to look like tickets. None of this sat well with Audrey Geisel, widow of Dr. Seuss (Theodor Geisel), who attended the screening. So did Karl ZoBell, the lawyer who represents her and who has represented the interests of Dr. Seuss for some 40 years. In an interview with NPR, he said he couldn't make out the yelling and thought maybe \"some nut\" was in the theater. Later, he asked the protesters what group they represented, and none would answer. Their silence didn't seem like an accident to him, which makes sense, because ZoBell has not been bashful about sending cease-and-desist letters to those who appropriate Dr. Seuss' material for their own purposes. And many do. (According to ZoBell, politicians love to sling the term Grinch at their rivals.) ZoBell says it would be nice if these people came up with their own material. But if they don't go too far\u2014by copping the illustrations, for example\u2014they can use a line like \"A person's a person, no matter how small,\" even if it wouldn't have pleased Dr. Seuss. And it wouldn't have. The Geisels were opposed to using the Dr. Seuss books for any political agenda. Some anti-abortion Web sites claim that Audrey is a supporter of Planned Parenthood. ZoBell says he's never discussed the issue of abortion with her and can't confirm that. It seems that Horton will inspire more anti-abortion activity in cities around the country. A Colorado group gathering signatures for a ballot initiative that would define life as beginning at conception will show up at theaters in Denver when the movie opens. Its members will wear T-shirts emblazoned with Horton's immortal words and try to get more signatures for their petition. They don't plan to disrupt the movie (which seems reasonable, since Colorado probably won't accept signatures from 6-year-olds). Executives at Fox say the studio is ignoring these plans. As for Audrey Geisel, it's not that we lack sympathy. But perhaps this wrath on behalf of the unborn is ironic punishment for having allowed Hollywood to inflict the previous movie versions of her husband's work on the born.

It describes how Pasdar, CEO of [Bat Blue Corporation](http://www.batblue.com/page.php?172), stumbled across an unmonitored and unlimited third-party access feed to the entire network of an unnamed major wireless telecommunications carrier (psst: If you're a [Verizon](http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/03/whistleblower-f.html) customer, pay attention), while working on an emergency \"migration\" of systems timed to a 2003 Christmas-season product launch (below). The telecom company's people told Pasdar, who they'd brought in for the project, that the unusual backdoor conduit was called the \"Quantico Circuit\" and \"should not be firewalled\" (Pages 3-4). Pasdar was concerned that the channel, code named for the [FBI academy](http://www.fbi.gov/hq/td/academy/academy.htm) in Northern Virginia, was an open door to his client's \"core network,\" giving unrestricted access to the cellular phone company's \"billing system, text messaging [and] fraud detection\" systems (Page 5). The conduit made it possible, for example, \"to tap into any conversation on any mobile phone supported by the carrier at any point\" (Page 6). To Pasdar's mind, \"Having a third party with completely open access to their network core\" seemed \"against organizational policy\" (Page 3).

The language of the Second Amendment has been the obsessive focus of just about everyone interested in [District of Columbia v. Heller](http://www.slate.com/id/2178391/), the D.C. gun-ownership case to be argued before the Supreme Court on Tuesday. That amendment is indeed important and much misunderstood. But Heller's facts, which involve the possession of a gun inside the home for self-defense, [lie rather far from the Second Amendment's core concerns](#2186771), as originally understood by the Founding Fathers. To think straight about gun control and the Constitution, we need to move past the Second Amendment and pay more heed to the Ninth and 14th Amendments. Let's begin here: Suppose, for argument's sake, that we concede that everything gun-control advocates say about the Second Amendment is right. Suppose that the amendment focused solely on arms-bearing in military contexts, and that it said absolutely nothing about an individual's right to have a gun while sleeping in his own home or hunting in his own private Idaho. Would this concession mean that no individual constitutional right exists today? Hardly. According to the Ninth Amendment: \"The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage other rights retained by the people.\" In other words, there may well be constitutional rights that are not explicitly set forth in the Second Amendment (or in any other amendment or constitutional clause, for that matter). In identifying these unenumerated \"rights retained by the people,\" the key is that a judge should not decide what he or she personally thinks would be a proper set of rights. Instead, the judge should ask which rights have been recognized by the American people themselves\u2014for example, in state constitutions and state bills of rights and civil rights laws. Americans have also established, merely by living our lives freely across the country and over the centuries, certain customary rights that governments have generally respected. Many of our most basic rights are simply facts of life, the residue of a virtually unchallenged pattern and practice on the ground in domains where citizens act freely and governments lie low. Consider, for example, the famous 1965 privacy case Griswold v. Connecticut. The state of Connecticut purported to criminalize the use of contraception, even by married couples, prompting the Supreme Court to strike down this extraordinarily intrusive state law as unconstitutional. Writing for the majority, Justice William Douglas claimed that a general right of privacy could be found in between the lines of the Bill of Rights. But Douglas did a poor job of proving his case. It's hard not to smirk when the First Amendment is used to protect the erotic urges of a man and a woman seeking to \"assemble\" on a bed. Writing separately in Griswold, the second Justice John Harlan, widely admired for his judicial care and craftsmanship, offered a more modest and less strained rationale: \"Conclusive, in my view, is the utter novelty of [Connecticut's] enactment. Although the Federal Government and many States have at one time or another had on their books statutes forbidding the distribution of contraceptives, none, so far as I can find, has made the use of contraceptives a crime.\" Thus, the basic practice of the American people rendered Connecticut's oddball law presumptively unconstitutional. It is also highly noteworthy that today around a dozen state constitutions and countless statutes speak explicitly of a right to privacy\u2014a right nowhere explicitly mentioned in the federal Constitution. Now take Harlan's sensible approach to the unenumerated right of privacy and apply it to Dick Anthony Heller's claim that he has a right to have a gun in his D.C. home for self-defense. When we look at the actual pattern of lived rights in America\u2014what the people have, in fact, done\u2014we find lots of regulations of guns, but few outright prohibitions of guns in homes as sweeping as the D.C. ordinance. We also find a right to keep guns affirmed in a great many modern state constitutions, several of which use the phrase \"bear arms\" in ways that clearly go beyond the military context. Unlike founding-era documents, modern state constitutions routinely affirm a constitutional right to \"bear arms\" for hunting, recreation, and/or self-defense. In addition to the Ninth Amendment, we should also view the right to bear arms through the lens of the 14th Amendment's command that \"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\" Though this particular sentence applies only to the states, other language in the 14th Amendment affirms that the federal government, too, has a parallel obligation to respect the fundamental rights of citizens. But the 14th Amendment did not specifically enumerate these sacred privileges and immunities. Instead, like the Ninth, the 14th invited interpreters to pay close attention to fundamental rights that Americans had affirmed through their lived experience\u2014in state bills of rights and in other canonical texts such as the Declaration of Independence and landmark civil rights legislation. And when it came to guns, a companion statute to the 14th Amendment, enacted by Congress in 1866, declared that \"laws ... concerning personal liberty [and] personal security ... including the constitutional right to bear arms, shall be secured to and enjoyed by all the citizens.\" Here, in sharp contrast to founding-era legal texts, the \"bear arms\" phrase was decisively severed from the military context. Women as well as men could claim a \"personal\" right to protect their \"personal liberty\" and \"personal security\" in their homes. The Reconstruction-era Congress clearly understood that Southern blacks might need guns in their homes to protect themselves from private violence in places where they could not rely on local constables to keep their neighborhoods safe. When guns were outlawed, only outlaw Klansmen would have guns, [to paraphrase a modern NRA slogan](http://www.amazon.com/When-guns-outlawed-outlaws-guns/dp/B000HLIS42). In this critical chapter in the history of American liberty, we find additional evidence of an individual right to have a gun in one's home, regardless of the original meaning of the Second Amendment. There are at least three advantages in shifting 21st-century gun-control discourse in this direction. First, a Ninth-and-14th Amendment framework is more modest. Unusually draconian gun laws can be struck down simply because they lie outside the lived pattern of the American experience, while more mainstream gun laws can be upheld precisely because they have proved acceptable to the people in many places. If our nation's capital wants to argue that specially strict gun rules should apply there because the city faces unique risks, no rigid textual language prevents judges from considering such pragmatic claims in the course of interpreting the boundaries of actual American practice. By contrast, if the Second Amendment's language really did guarantee a right to guns in homes, by what authority could judges allow for a different approach in D.C.? And then, if one has a Second Amendment right to a pistol or shotgun at home, why not a machine gun? Given that the Second Amendment's core right is military, it would seem odd that military arms would be easier to ban than other weapons. Second, the Ninth and 14th Amendments are more modern and democratically responsive. The Ninth invites us to consider not only rights that have long been part of the American tradition but also rights that have emerged in actual modern practice and in state constitutional clauses of relatively recent vintage that are relatively easy to amend. The 14th directs our attention to the still-relevant problems of race and police protection or the absence thereof. By contrast, the Second Amendment harkens back to a lost 18th-century America, where citizens regularly mustered for militia service on the town square and where the federal army was rightly suspect. This is not our world. Finally, a focus on the Ninth and 14th Amendments is simply more honest. The open-ended language of the Ninth and 14th Amendments really did aim to invite Americans to ponder state constitutional provisions that declare rights, and these provisions really do focus on individual self-defense. The framers of the 14th Amendment really did focus intently on self-defense in the home. The framers of the Second did not. Return to [article](#back2186771) The Second Amendment reads, \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\" At the founding, the core connotation of the phrase \"bear arms\" was military. Soldiers and militiamen \"bore arms,\" whereas hunters or homeowners simply carried guns, firearms, or weapons. Almost every founding-era state constitution that featured the phrase \"bear arms\" was referring to soldiers and militiamen and not to private gun use by an individual in a home or on a hunt. The central image was of Minutemen bearing guns, not Daniel Boone gunning bears. The word militia in the amendment's opening clause confirms this military thrust, as does the counterbalancing word, people, in the closing clause. At the founding, these two paired words were roughly synonymous. In a sound republic, the militia was composed of the people\u2014the voters. As a rule, those who bore arms in defense of the state should vote and those who voted should bear arms. So, too, voters should generally serve on juries. Militias, grand juries, and trial juries were all close cousins. This week, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an important gun-control case for the first time in 69 years. And almost lost amid all the polemical screeching on both sides about the contours of the constitutional \"right to bear arms\" lies the fact that the high court is about step into a cultural conflict for the first time in 69 years. Think about it: abortion, homosexuality, affirmative action, separation of church and state, the death penalty. The court has gleefully waded into almost every hot-button social issue dividing this country for decades. Both conservatives and some very smart liberals have taken the position that in doing so, the high court has unerringly messed things up. Justice Antonin Scalia contends that the court should not conduct itself like an unelected superlegislature. It's not for the court to invent new rights; it's for the people: \" [You think the death penalty](http://judicialnetwork.com/cgi-data/of_note/files/4.shtml) is a good idea? Persuade your fellow citizens to adopt it. You want a right to abortion? Persuade your fellow citizens and enact it.\" Meanwhile, at the center-left, thinkers like the University of Chicago's [Cass Sunstein](http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/980430/sunstein.shtml) agree that judicial \"minimalism\" or restraint is far preferable to solving sprawling social problems with judicially imposed moral judgments. Some of the country's pre-eminent liberal scholars now go further and contend that had matters as important as abortion and segregation been left up to the democratically elected branches, we would not still be feeling a Warren Court backlash today. With [District of Columbia v. Heller](http://www.scotuswiki.com/index.php?title=DC_v._Heller), these bipartisan critics may have fished their wish. The case tests the constitutionality of D.C.'s sweeping gun ban, which prohibits handgun possession at home unless guns were registered before 1976 and requires that the rifles and shotguns permitted must be kept unloaded and either disassembled or bound by a trigger lock. Last year, by a 2-1 vote, a federal appeals court struck down this ban on the theory that the Second Amendment confers upon \"the people\" an individual right to bear arms, rather than a collective right to arm its militias. The most dramatic aspect of Heller\u2014and trust me, the drama abounds\u2014may well be that the last time the Supreme Court issued a major proclamation on the right to bear arms, the year was 1939, and criminals sported fedoras and drove Packards. That makes this case a perfect natural experiment in what happens when the Supreme Court butts out. All right, then. What happens when the Supreme Court hangs back for decades and quietly allows the political processes to resolve explosive and contentious issues? The vacuum is not necessarily filled by temperate legislative debate. On the gun front, when the courts hung back, the special interest groups rushed in. The Supreme Court determined in 1939, in [United States v. Miller](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0307_0174_ZS.html), that an individual right to a gun had no \"reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia,\" and thus the Second Amendment did not confer individual rights to gun ownership. The court followed with seven decades of constitutional radio silence on the subject, either reaffirming Miller in a whisper or declining to hear new cases. So much radio silence created an assumption that the debate was over: There was simply [no individual right](http://www.slate.com/id/1007957/) protected by the Second Amendment. This led former Solicitor General Erwin Griswold to insist: \"[T]hat the Second Amendment poses no barrier to strong gun laws is perhaps the most well-settled proposition in American Constitutional law.\" Time and again the lower federal courts of appeals followed the Miller line until it appeared the question was settled there, as well. While the courts kept quiet, an extremely well-funded and powerful lobby group, the National Rifle Association, forcefully and effectively pushed the claim that the Second Amendment confers an individual right to bear arms. The NRA is 4 million-plus members strong and has handed out $15.3 million to candidates (most of them Republican) since 1980. It's credited by some with the [2000 defeat of Al Gore](http://www.alternet.org/election04/19223/) in rural states. But the NRA's political and financial clout pales next to its influence on our constitutional consciousness: National polls consistently show that in the wake of decades of legal scholarship, lobbying efforts, and an unparalleled public education campaign, about [75 percent of Americans](http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/politics/2008/03/06/in-congress-the-uphill-battle-for-gun-control.html) believe the Constitution affords a personal right to own guns, even though a slight majority of Americans [favor gun control](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2007/04/parsing_the_polls_gun_control.html) of some sort. That means that over 70 years, public opinion has more or less flipped Miller on its head. It's romantic, really. Most of us longing for the legal reality we already had. For many decades, this strange disconnect between the public understanding of the Second Amendment and the courts' interpretation simmered silently. In 1991, former Chief Justice Warren Burger even described the \"individual rights\" view of the Second Amendment as \"one of the greatest pieces of fraud\u2014I repeat the word 'fraud'\u2014on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.\" But the courts, including the Supreme Court, just stayed out of the conflict. Until last year, when the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit struck down the D.C. gun ban on the theory that the NRA is right, and the Second Amendment does protect an individual right to bear arms. Perhaps it's actually better for these complicated social questions to be decided by special interest groups than in the courts. But one other group of unsung heroes also led the charge against Miller: liberal legal academics. According to Robert Spitzer, a political scientist at State University of New York-Cortland and author of The Politics of Gun Control, the very failure of the Supreme Court to revisit the fight over the Second Amendment for all those decades created \"the allegation of some legal pathology; that the court was avoiding it or embarrassed by it.\" This sense of intellectual embarrassment prompted one important liberal thinker, professor Sanford Levinson of the University of Texas, to pen a 1989 law review article in favor of a \"strong reading\" for the individual rights theory of the Second Amendment. Harvard Law School's Laurence Tribe and other prominent liberals followed. Many of these scholars were less interested in forcing major changes to modern gun-control policy than in insider constitutional housekeeping. (They insist you can't be for strong individual rights under the Constitution and treat the Second Amendment like elevator music.) But the intellectual shift by the liberal academy helped motivate Dr. Robert Levy, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and the engine behind the Heller lawsuit. Lately, some of those liberal thinkers have even been inching away from the political implications of their constitutional thought experiments. So long-overdue is Supreme Court scrutiny in Heller that the Bush administration has now staked out one position, while Dick Cheney has staked out another. This has resulted in [big fun](http://www.slate.com/id/2185927/) for court watchers and less fun for the folks arguing against the D.C. gun ban this week. But another interesting question lurks under the showdown on gun rights: whether, in the absence of bold judicial pronouncements, large constitutional matters are truly better thrashed out by well-funded interest groups and well-meaning academics. A version of this piece appeared in Newsweek magazine. Barack Obama will spend the day in [Oregon](http://www.mapthecandidates.com/?l=Oregon) tomorrow\u2014his first visit to the West Coast since campaigning in Washington state and California in early February. Obama's dominant victory in Washington on Feb. 9 (he won with 68 percent of the vote) helped launch a streak of 10 straight victories that solidified his pledged-delegate lead. Oregon's 52 delegates are assigned via primary, but Obama is still favored to win the state by a large margin. This is the first time a presidential candidate has been to Oregon since Dennis Kucinich and John Edwards spoke to the state's AFL-CIO chapter in October. Clinton, meanwhile, does not have any public events scheduled for Friday.

Earlier this month, scientists at Georgia Tech [announced their invention](http://www.gtresearchnews.gatech.edu/newsrelease/sensor-necklace.htm) of a necklace that records the date and time at which a person swallows his prescription medicine. The device (which looks more like a dog collar than jewelry) responds to a tiny magnet in the pill as it travels down the esophagus. Other recently developed similar technologies include a [drug-filled prosthetic tooth](http://www.sciencecentric.com/news/pda/article.php?q=08011526) that slowly drips medicine into the mouth and a [pill bottle](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1950142,00.asp) that sends a wireless message to your pharmacist every time it's opened. Are we so bad at taking medicine that we need false teeth to do it for us and pill bottles that tattle on us when we don't? It would seem so. [About 50 percent](http://alignmap.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/Incidence%20&%20Prevalence%20Of%20Patient%20Noncompliance.pdf) of patients fail to correctly follow prescriptions: We forget to take pills, we alter doses, we take breaks. Nonadherence\u2014the medical term for neglecting to abide by a doctor's orders\u2014is [rampant](http://alignmap.com/noncompliance-fact-fiction/costs/), resulting in up to one-quarter of all hospital and nursing home admissions. It's also expensive. The problem persists despite monumental efforts to prevent it. Why? For one thing, it's impossible to predict which patients are likely to deviate from their orders. And while the problem seems like it should have a simple solution, it doesn't. Nonadherence, it turns out, is one more reason to heed the call for better American health care. Blowing off a doctor's instructions might seem like the act of a basically healthy person. Who hasn't neglected to take that last antibiotic or exercised less than the doctor said to? But treatment drop-off rates are high among the seriously ill, too. About half the people who undergo kidney transplants do not adequately adhere to the regimen necessary to thwart rejection of their new organ. A [1970s study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5210829?ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum) found that 43 percent of glaucoma patients refused to take the doctor-ordered measures necessary to prevent blindness, even when that refusal had already led to blindness in one eye. Cost of medication is an obvious consideration. A [recent study](http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/1/89) in Health Affairs reported that 29 percent of patients with chronic kidney failure in the United States did not purchase needed drugs because they were too expensive. It's understandable: Their co-pay of $114 for a month of medication was the highest of all 12 countries included in the analysis. By contrast, British patients, who had the lowest out-of-pocket costs, were the best at sticking with treatment. But cost wasn't the only factor that determined whether patients took their medicine. Swedish patients also had high monthly co-pays, but they were great at following their prescriptions. And good adherence among Japanese patients was only partially explained by low costs. The authors of the Health Affairs study wondered about the influence of cultural factors but also pointed to the health system structure: Since Japanese doctors earn income by selling medicine directly to patients, they have an incentive to make sure prescriptions get filled. In the United States, where doctors don't play that middleman role, they have a devil of a time predicting which patients are likely to deviate. Psychiatrist Allan Showalter, who writes about nonadherence at [AlignMap.com](http://www.alignmap.com/), explains that no matter how long they've been practicing, doctors tend to drastically overestimate their patients' likelihood of sticking to regimens. It's the medical version of the Lake Wobegon syndrome: Doctors consider their own patients to be above average. [One study](http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=7260749) asked physicians to predict adherence only among patients they knew well, and the doctors still grossly overestimated. Patients who don't follow doctors' orders defy prediction because as a group, they lack defining characteristics. Intelligence, age, gender, and economic background all have no bearing. Even doctors are a mixed bag. In a [study of medical students](http://www.nature.com/clpt/journal/v59/n5/abs/clpt1996420a.html) who were prescribed a regimen of Tic Tacs, fewer than half followed instructions fully, even though they knew it was candy and that the exercise was specifically designed to teach them about this issue. Basically, decades of research to identify measures of nonadherence have yielded just one fact: There are no solid measures. Clearly, some medical disobedience is no different from any other deviant behavior, like speeding or jaywalking. Sometimes the treatment being prescribed is just too much. Few diabetics follow the complete roster of lifestyle recommendations, mainly because doing so is extremely difficult. Other times, patients decide that because of side effects, a treatment just isn't worth it\u2014many patients with life-threatening diseases would rather live better than live longer. But these explanations only account for a small percentage of nonadherents. Why aren't the rest of us better at following doctors' orders? As it turns out, there is one predictive factor: experience with the health care system. A [study of 186 doctors](http://www.rand.org/pubs/reprints/RP261/) and their patients with diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension found that whether patients got their questions answered correlated strongly with whether they would stick with treatment. Other factors that mattered included the doctor's level of job satisfaction, how many patients he or she sees per week, and whether patients scheduled a follow-up appointment. As health care consultant [Kip Piper](http://www.piperreport.com/) explains, the average doctor's visit clocks in at less than 20 minutes, leaving little time for discussion. And when patients do ask questions, they are usually interrupted [within 18 seconds](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6486600?ordinalpos=12&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum). With little explanation, tricky regimens may not be followed correctly, or a person may take a break from a drug, not understanding the importance of completing the regimen. Many times, patients simply don't understand the doctor's orders. Requiring patients to use [mail-order companies](http://www.pharmacychoices.org/Pitfalls2.html) to order some drugs, as health insurers are increasingly doing, will probably make matters worse. The [legion of gadgets](http://www.bindependent.com/hompg/bi/bindep/store/aisles/gaincontrol/medmanageprod/medmanage2.htm) helps some patients but doesn't make a big enough dent because the contraptions don't address these underlying issues. [Concierge medicine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concierge_medicine) is a more successful fix: For an annual fee, doctors promise to limit the number of patients they treat and provide a higher level of care. But, while effective, this approach is inherently limited. The fee of up to $1,500 is prohibitive for many people, and in any case, there aren't that many VIP doctors out there. Adherence, then, is unlikely to improve much unless something changes dramatically in the health care system. Or else, we need to invent a drug for nonadherence. If only anyone would take it. In [John Adams](http://www.slate.com/id/2186555/), HBO's seven-part miniseries about America's second president, the producers have rendered each scene with as much historical accuracy as time and money will allow. The cottages have small windows and low chimneys; the lamps and fires glow with era-appropriate candlepower; the horses bear the saddles of the period; the food looks as scary as 18th-century farm vittles should; and the costumes are American Girl-worthy. Everywhere you look, it's award-winning verisimilitude. Except for one wee oversight. Teeth. All of the actors have glorious 21st-century show-biz teeth. This problem, of course, is a familiar one: All of Hollywood has significant unresolved dental issues. Famous actors are eager to embrace all manner of abuse. They gain weight, they lose weight, they smoke cigarettes, they sport awful hairdos or shave their heads. And yet on TV and in the movies, an actor must never be asked to traverse the Dental Curtain: The pearly whites must never be scuffed or dented. Hollywood's systematic denial of dental reality is an example of its elevation of glamour over truth, thrill over drab. Perhaps, though, something more is at play in John Adams. Maybe the faux dental presentation is a deliberate extension of the patriotism implicit in the miniseries. In the 21st century, even as the United States' status as a world power is wobbling and our cultural and moral authority erodes, we can still be proud of our dental heritage. Our teeth stand tall compared with those of our friends in the European Union (and Asia and South America and everywhere that is heartlessly crushing our dollar). Our molars are better than their molars. The anachronism of the John Adams dentistry, however, is particularly striking because the miniseries features prominently the beloved and edentulous father of our country. The actor who plays George Washington, David Morse, is fitted handsomely with replica uniform, balding pate, faint (Scottish?) accent, appropriately soaring height\u2014and standard-issue blinding California chompers. Yet George Washington's bad teeth are almost as legendary as his Delaware crossing. You can see the consequences on the dollar bill in your wallet, courtesy of Gilbert Stuart's portrait. Look closely at Washington's jowls. Keep in mind that he was a tall, gangly guy, not a pudge\u2014yet these are the cheeks you'd expect on Babe Ruth or Jackie Gleason. A comparison of the dollar-bill image with [the original Stuart portrait](http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Gilbert_Stuart/images/gs.47.L.jpg) shows an even more swollen and dentally discomfited first president. Washington's cheeks are swollen because, due to his rotten teeth, he developed the predictable lymph-node swelling that occurs in response to any chronic infection. This gives him that unsettling chipmunk look. (Physician disclaimer: Mine is a [Sen. Frist-style eyeball diagnosis](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A48119-2005Mar18.html)\u2014I personally never have examined Mr. Washington.) Washington's teeth [reportedly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_washington) began to fall out when he was a young man. By the time he finished his presidency, he had only one remaining. The rumor that his replacement teeth were wooden, by the way, is false. [Rather, the First Dentures were made](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_washington) of \"hippopotamus and elephant ivory, held together with gold springs. The hippo ivory was used for the plate, into which real human teeth and also bits of horses and donkeys teeth were inserted.\" (The intrepid can [visit a part of his dentures](http://www.dentalmuseum.umaryland.edu/exhibitions/permanent/).) In the centuries since, American dentists have taken us far from those bad old days. Their European counterparts have not been as stalwart. Those suave Europeans just don't get it. Teeth, after all, are more than a cosmetic attribute\u2014they are essential to human nutrition. What is the difference between a Green Bay Packers lineman and a fleet-footed wing on an EU soccer field? I mean, besides the steroids and the personal trainers and weight-gain shakes? Teeth. Our guys can chew anything. Teeth are what give us American muscles, if not American muscle. Consider this: During World War I and World War II, bad teeth were among the most common reasons for exclusion from the U.S. military. According to one study, about 15 percent of men seeking to enlist were turned away for dental reasons. The military viewed good teeth as such a necessity that enlistees were required to have 12 opposable teeth arranged as follows: \"a minimum of 3 serviceable natural masticating teeth above the gum and 3 below opposing; and 3 serviceable natural incisors above and 3 below opposing. Therefore the minimum requirements consist of 6 masticating teeth and of 6 incisor teeth.\" Our boys needed to chew, to eat, in order to stay alive. Soon after the end of World War II, the country's public-health experts persuaded most states to adopt routine fluoridation of water, an intervention that resulted in a 68 percent reduction in cavities and other types of decay. This achievement is so highly regarded that, in 1999, when the [CDC listed](http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/tengpha.htm) the 10 greatest public-health achievements of the 20th century, fluoridation of water was right up there with standard favorites like vaccination and seatbelts. It's inexplicable that the heroes of this great American triumph\u2014the dentists\u2014remain consigned to the sidelines and punch lines of history. Perhaps we have forgotten our snaggletoothed past because we're too busy seething at that dentist who gave us a lousy filling or painful implant. And perhaps the effort expended to pump up one dull overlooked hero, John Adams, so exhausted the show's producers that they can be forgiven their failure to promote another dull virtue: the value of dentists, flossing, and brushing after meals. It took only a week. Last Monday, when rumors began to circulate that Bear Stearns was having liquidity problems, Bear Executive Committee Chairman Ace Greenberg and CEO Alan Schwartz assured investors that the rumors were, in Greenberg's words, \" [ridiculous](http://www.cnbc.com/id/23561058/),\" that the storied brokerage house had a strong balance sheet, and that its liquidity situation was fine. Schwartz maintained as much through Wednesday, despite mounting concerns and downgrades by analysts, pointing out that Bear had $17 billion on its balance sheet. Between Wednesday and Friday morning, full-fledged panic ensued, and Bear's counterparties\u2014its clients and lenders\u2014began withdrawing their cash from the firm, a textbook run on the bank, creating a liquidity crisis where there had arguably been none. Now Bear is being [bailed out](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/business/16cnd-bear.html?em&ex=1205899200&en=ca62f6b1b4fd516e&ei=5087%0A) by the Fed via JPMorgan Chase, which is buying the troubled firm for $2 a share. And as one might expect, the finger-pointing and recriminations have already begun. Bear Chairman Jimmy Cayne [was at a bridge tournament in Detroit](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=az0spDmq.lvg&refer=home) while the Fed was arranging the bailout package, which didn't help the perception that management wasn't paying enough attention to looming catastrophes. The Fed itself is dodging criticism from people who worry that its willingness to play lender of last resort to the embattled brokerage will cause similar institutions to expect that their worst mistakes can be fixed with a Fed bailout. These are not irrelevant concerns, but regardless of whether Jimmy was playing bridge while Bear burned or whether the Fed is going to find itself perpetually crowbarring financial institutions out of the corners into which they've wedged themselves, this week's bailout was the least disastrous possible outcome. If Bear had been left alone to collapse under the weight of its own problems, the broader effects would have been devastating (or, considering today's carnage, more devastating). The alternative would have been to let Bear slide into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which would have happened quickly. Among other things, Moody's, S&P, and Fitch all [downgraded Bear on Friday](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080314/bear_stearns_ratings.html?.v=1), potentially forcing the firm to put up additional collateral to meet the requirements of a credit-default swap triggered by the downgrades\u2014collateral it didn't have. Bear notionally holds $13 trillion in derivatives contracts, and even if credit-default swaps were only a small fraction of that, any sort of credit event would have been catastrophic for both Bear and its buyers, the latter of whom would find themselves holding guarantees from a firm that was not in a position to guarantee anything. Bear's client assets would also have been frozen in the event of a bankruptcy, crippling not just the brokerage but many of the hedge funds that have collateral at the firm. (Fear of this happening is part of reason that the run on the bank\u2014or run on the brokerage, rather\u2014happened in the first place.) Taxpayers would have ended up footing the bill for assets that were federally insured, effectively a different kind of bailout. And the psychological repercussions of a Bear bankruptcy would have been even more devastating than the financial ones. Bear Stearns may not technically be a bank, but it's a market leader in prime brokerage and clearing, which means that it's providing trading and back-end services to many other Wall Street financial institutions. Over time, the smaller players in these areas would pick up Bear's business, but the firm occupies enough of the market that the vacuum it left wouldn't be filled quickly or easily. In what has been an era of mega-mergers in the financial-services sector, it's inconceivable that any single large player could disappear overnight without sending ripples\u2014or, more accurately, small tsunamis\u2014through the entire industry, particularly when confidence levels are so shaky. Even with the bailout, we're seeing a shadow of the disaster that might have been. Asian markets [were down this morning](http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/03/17/ap4779109.html), despite the calming of last week's worst-case fears that a Bear collapse would wreak havoc on the yen trading. And perhaps most tellingly, Lehman Brothers, which has a somewhat similar profile to that of Bear, [was down about 20 percent in trading Monday](http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200803171658DOWJONESDJONLINE000821_FORTUNE5.htm) on fears that its clients may do the same thing Bear's did, leaving it in a similar position. Lehman Brothers' pre-emptive acquisition of a $2 billion break-glass-in-case-of-emergency credit line does not seem to have reduced the market's fearful comparisons. Panic spreads quickly, and it's not hard to imagine a scenario in which clients get uncomfortable with minor exposure to credit markets and run for their lives simply because their brokerage house looks vaguely like Bear. Unfortunately, it's not clear that the Fed can handle many more bailouts of this size. The dollar [plunged to new lows](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/13/AR2008031303620.html?hpid=topnews) against foreign currencies this week. There are plenty of reasons for its plunge, but at the most basic level, the dollar's weakness reflects the world's collective, two-thumbs-down verdict about the ability of the United States\u2014businesses, individuals, the government, the Federal Reserve\u2014to manage the global financial system and the world's largest economy. Countries that outsourced their monetary policy by pegging domestic currencies to the dollar are having second thoughts. Kuwait last year [detached the dinar from the dollar](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601083&sid=axpON9NWC0W4&refer=currency), and Qatar government officials last week said they were considering doing the same with their currency. International financiers are unnerved by the toxic combination of \"misplaced assumptions about housing, a lack of necessary regulation and irresponsible use of debt with sophisticated financial instruments,\" said Ashraf Laidi, currency strategist at CMC Markets. Dissing American financial management is an affront to national pride tantamount to standing in Rome and asking, loudly, if Italians are able to make pasta. The United States invented the concept and practice of running large, complex systems. Along with baseball and deep-frying, management is one of our great national pastimes. The world's first MBAs were awarded by pioneering yuppie factories such as the [Wharton School](http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania. (Wharton's founding in 1881 was quickly followed by the world's first time-share summer houses in the Hamptons.) Henry Ford's revolutionary assembly line was the gold standard in global manufacturing for decades. Contemporary American institutions stand for excellence in managing everything from supply chains (Wal-Mart) to delivery services (Federal Express and UPS). Americans' ability to manage complex systems has been the ultimate competitive advantage. It has allowed the United States to enjoy high growth and low inflation\u2014a record we haven't hesitated to lord over our foreign friends. The shelves in the business section of a bookstore in a mall in Johannesburg, South Africa, are stocked with the same volumes you'll find in a Barnes & Noble in Pittsburgh, Pa.: memoirs by cornfed [paragons of capitalism like Jack Welch](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/702-8351298-5273651?%5Fencoding=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books-ca&field-author=Jack%20Welch), wealth-building advice from American money managers, large tomes on how Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller built global businesses from scratch. But now, thanks to widespread incompetence, American management is on its way to becoming an international laughingstock. Faith in American financial sobriety has been widely undermined by the subprime mess. The very mention of the strong-dollar policy now elicits raucous bouts of knee-slapping in even the most sober Swiss banks. (How do you say schadenfreude in German?) Earlier this month, as [oil hovered near $100 a barrel](http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_wco_k_w.htm), President Bush complained to OPEC about high oil prices. OPEC President Chakib Khelil responded acidly that crude's remarkable run had nothing to do with the reluctance of Persian Gulf nations to pump oil, and everything to do with the \"mismanagement of the U.S. economy.\" Since Bush's plea, oil has [gushed to $110 per barrel](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12400801/). (How do you say schadenfreude in Arabic?) Americans abroad are constantly taunted by perceived failings of American management. America's aviation system is now the butt of jokes because 9-year-olds have become accustomed to removing their Heelys before boarding a plane. As my family and I passed through the snaking security line in Canc\u00fan, Mexico's airport last month, we were harangued by a security guard who encouraged tourists to sing along with him: \"Please. Do not. Remove. Your shoes.\" The concern extends beyond airlines to America's industrial complex. Doubtful of the ability of provincial American executives, with their limited language skills, to negotiate today's global business environment, the boards of massive U.S. firms like Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, Alcoa, and insurer AIG have hired [foreign-born CEOs](http://www.slate.com/id/2172346/). Carl Icahn, the 1980s corporate raider, has reinvented himself as a borscht-belt comedian/activist investor, who delights conferences and reporters with jokes at CEOs' expense. On a recent 60 Minutes, [Icahn complained to Lesley Stahl](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/03/06/60minutes/main3915473.shtml) about the incompetence of American management. \"I see our country going off a cliff, and I feel bad about it.\" Icahn is moping all the way to the bank. The market's recognition of management failures gives him the opportunities to acquire companies on the cheap. But those of us who aren't billionaire corporate raiders\u2014which is to say pretty much all of us\u2014must manage through this management crisis on our own. In Drillbit Taylor (Paramount Pictures), produced by Judd Apatow, co-written by Seth Rogen and Kristofor Brown, and starring Owen Wilson, the career trajectories of three comic talents converge to dispiriting effect. It's Apatow's fourth project in the madly prolific year since his megahit [Knocked Up](http://www.slate.com/id/2167386/), Rogen's second outing as a writer since the critically well-received [Superbad](http://www.slate.com/id/2172339/), and the last movie Owen Wilson made before his suicide attempt. I'm not suggesting that there was a connection between those two events for Wilson, but if you were already considering ending it all, having the Drillbit Taylor script by your bedside wouldn't help. The setup\u2014three nerdy high-school freshmen hire a homeless man to protect them against a school bully\u2014sounds unpromising but not hopeless. It's the slipshod and joyless execution that makes the whole affair so grim. Rogen is like a high-school English student trying to get away with plagiarizing his own book report. The central trio is directly cribbed from Superbad, released only seven months ago. Wade (Nate Hartley) is the Michael Cera, the shy, skinny kid with a painful crush on an out-of-his-league girl. Ryan (Troy Gentile) is the Jonah Hill, the fat loudmouth. And Emmit (David Dorfman) is the Christopher Mintz-Plasse, the guy so desperately geeky that even the dork set shuns him. Tortured by a sadistic upperclassman, Filkins (Alex Frost), the three decide to pool their allowances and hire a bodyguard. After one of those loony-job-interview montages that (along with makeover montages and getting-in-shape montages) must be produced in bulk and stocked in studio warehouses, the boys choose Bob \"Drillbit\" Taylor (Wilson), an AWOL Army vet who passes himself off as a black-ops expert. He pretends to train the boys in martial arts and mind control, all the while scheming with his homeless buddies to rob the boys' homes and pawn their parents' stuff. I could go on to detail the process by which Drillbit infiltrates the school posing as a substitute teacher, romances a fellow faculty member (Leslie Mann), and comes to realize that he needs the boys as much as they need him. But let me just freeze the frame for a second: Homeless Army vet, living alone in tent, conspires to deceive and steal from children. This is a comedy? It's not that a would-be funny movie\u2014even one aimed at preteens, as this is\u2014shouldn't be allowed to deal in unsavory characters or depressing social realities. But Drillbit Taylor seems oblivious to the fact that homelessness is depressing or burglary unsavory. Drillbit's marginalized social status\u2014he grabs unclaimed food off cafe tables and leaves a smell behind wherever he goes\u2014passes for a character quirk. Even after the kids learn their mentor is homeless, they seem unconcerned with finding out how and why he gets by. They just keep showing up at his tent in the woods for more judo lessons. This obliviousness is an ongoing problem in Apatow's films, which invite the criticism by presenting themselves as moral fables: The seriousness of his characters' mistakes often seems to exceed the penance they pay. In other words, they get off the hook too easy. Remember the scene in Superbad where Mintz-Plasse's character, McLovin, shot at a flaming police car with the two rogue cops who had just totaled it? There was something so disturbing and frightening about that moment, an all-out fulfillment of a teenage boy's fantasy of lawless destruction, that I thought the movie might take an unexpectedly dark turn. Instead, it soon became clear that McLovin's adventure was exactly what he perceived it to be: a really rad night on the town. Here, both Drillbit's crimes (lying, theft) and the boys' (indifference to their friend's living conditions) are absolved too quickly in an implausible and fraudulent happy ending. Though I didn't love Superbad (except for the brilliant Michael Cera), its profane put-downs sound like Noel Coward next to the lame sallies offered in Drillbit. Rogen can be an ingenious writer of individual lines, but he has yet to develop a sense of story structure. Drillbit Taylor is slackly paced and rife with questionable logic. (What's the older bully doing in a freshman English class?) As for Owen Wilson, I'm not going to be too hard on him for dusting off his golden-boy shtick yet again for this limp frolic. Last year, I wrote a piece musing on the Wilson brothers' [midcareer slump](http://www.slate.com/id/2166476/). Learning a few months later of Owen's troubles, I regretted having added to the pile. But reading a summary of Owen's next project, Marley & Me (an adaptation of the best-selling book about a \"couple that adopts a dog to give parenthood a trial run, then finds the mischievous pooch more than they bargained for\"), makes me want to mail him a copy of Siddhartha and send him on a vision quest. Did this smart, handsome, talented man really go to hell and back just to make a romantic comedy with a dog? Anthony Minghella, the British director and screenwriter who died of a brain hemorrhage yesterday at the age of 54, will probably be remembered for his 1996 film, The English Patient, which won nine Academy Awards, including best director and best picture. At the time, that sweep was seen as heralding a new age of recognition for smaller, independent films at the Oscars\u2014a theory that held water about as long as Titanic, which came along to claim the top honors the very next year. But even if The English Patient didn't single-handedly end the reign of the award-grabbing blockbuster, it does look, in retrospect, like a turning point for international-prestige cinema. Like the next two films Minghella would write and direct, The Talented Mr. Ripley and Cold Mountain, it was a glossy, high-toned literary adaptation with a handsome international cast, intelligent without being inaccessible, middlebrow without being dumb. Minghella was sometimes compared to David Lean, the British director of epics like Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago. He specialized in lush, sweeping historical dramas that you could feel good about taking your grandmother to see on Christmas Day, even if their subject matter (the memories of a Nazi collaborator, the machinations of a murderous identity thief) could be forbiddingly dark. Because he died with decades of work still ahead of him, we'll never know whether Minghella would have made another movie with the lasting power of his first one, Truly, Madly, Deeply, a 1990 made-for-television comedy that was successful enough to gain a big-screen release and a BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay. The story of a grief-stricken pianist (Juliet Stevenson) whose cellist lover (Alan Rickman) comes back from the dead to hang around the house they once shared, Truly, Madly, Deeply is on my semisecret list of all-time favorite movies. Semisecret because I don't know that I could entirely defend the choice: It's not as if the film is formally innovative or visually impressive or thematically original. It's just so damn wonderful. The ghost who comes back to help his or her loved ones mourn is a familiar figure, from Hamlet to Ghost (also released in 1990) to such recent grotesqueries as P.S. I Love You. But Truly, Madly, Deeply manages to make that familiarity feel less like a clich\u00e9 than a profoundly resonant archetype. The scene in which Rickman's character, Jamie, first appears to Nina (Stevenson) is an example of how Minghella tweaks a formula to evoke the agony of real grief. As the bereft Nina sits playing the piano, the camera revolves to reveal the blurred outline of Jamie sitting behind her, accompanying her on his cello. At first we take this as a familiar bit of cinematic syntax: Jamie isn't really there, we're just seeing a symbol of Nina's memory of him. Any minute now, she'll snap her head around and see only an empty chair. Instead, Jamie puts down his cello and moves out of the frame himself, confirming the viewer's assumption: His presence was just a figment of her imagination. The camera then pans a little to left to reveal the unambiguously real Jamie, and we realize at the same moment Nina does that the man she buried months ago is standing in her living room. What follows is a reunion scene that, even in this [decontextualized and blurry clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll37xdj8rpU), should reduce anyone who's ever loved and lost\u2014or even just loved\u2014to a quivering jelly. Minghella started his career as a stage director, and his touch with actors is palpable in every scene of Truly, Madly, Deeply. Rickman and Stevenson, both extraordinary performers, are given the freedom to improvise in scenes like [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xONNm3X_rok&feature=related), in which she dances around the living room as they belt out a decidedly amateur version of \"The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore.\" The result is an on-screen romance of unusual texture and intimacy. By the time Jamie is ready to rejoin the world of the shades, you sense the true magnitude of what both he and Nina have lost (and if you're me, you've also developed a debilitating, lifelong crush on Alan Rickman). Over the years, I've discovered that there's a kind of secret cult for Truly, Madly, Deeply. People who have no clue who Anthony Minghella is can passionately quote great chunks of [dialogue](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103129/quotes) from this film. The movie's potent appeal isn't surprising; how many psychologically accurate portraits of grief also hold up as romantic comedies that are both funny and madly romantic? I've recommended Truly, Madly, Deeply to friends mourning their own losses as a kind of homeopathic remedy. And I have one friend who watched it with his ailing wife only weeks before she died, both of them laughing and crying as they wondered what kind of ghost she would be. The British film industry is still stunned by the unexpected and early death of Anthony Minghella, who was an important figure there; he held the title of commander of the British Empire and was, until recently, the chairman of the British Film Institute. Minghella also leaves behind a wife and two children. (His 22-year-old son, Max Minghella, has acted in several films, including Syriana and Art School Confidential.) It might make Minghella happy to know that those still figuring out how to mourn him can turn to his own best movie for advice. Portfolio, April 2008 The [cover story](http://www.portfolio.com/executives/features/2008/03/17/Sexism-in-the-Workplace) claims women's advances in the workplace have stalled. Despite improvement in the 1980s in the gap between men and women's pay, \"gains since then have been partly erased by a drop every few years.\" For instance, female lawyers' salaries are dropping in relation to their male counterparts': In 2006, they made 70.5 percent of what male lawyers make, compared with 77.5 in 2005.

Their exclusion from the convention also keeps the total delegates available below 4,050, which means Hillary has less wiggle room to chip away at Obama's lead. As of now, she would need to win each remaining state by 28 points to catch Obama in pledged delegates. That's a Herculean task, and even an average margin of victory of 14 points is difficult because of Obama's strengths in North Carolina, Oregon, Montana, and South Dakota. The light at the end of the tunnel has disappeared from Hillary's already-bleak path to pledged delegate supremacy. But Clinton isn't careening off the rails yet. She's still convinced she can sway enough superdelegates to make up her pledged delegate margin of defeat. That's also doubtful considering Obama will hold leads in the number of states won, the pledged delegate tallies, and\u2014most likely\u2014the popular vote. If you're a die-hard Clintonista and don't believe us, play with the new and improved Delegate Calculator below to see for yourself. Methodology To mark the fifth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, Slate has asked a number of writers who originally supported the war to answer the question, \"Why did we get it wrong?\" We have invited contributions from the best-known \"liberal hawks,\" many of whom participated in two previous Slate debates about the war, [the first](http://www.slate.com/id/2071522/entry/2071561/) before it began in fall of 2002, [the second](http://www.slate.com/id/2093620/entry/2093641/) in early 2004. \" [How Did I Get Iraq Wrong?](http://www.slate.com/id/2187008/) Wrong question.

Posted March 17, 2008. (Kanan Makiya chatted online with readers about this article; read the [transcript](http://www.slate.com/id/2187049/).) \" [How Did I Get Iraq Wrong?](http://www.slate.com/id/2186740/) I didn't,\" by Christopher Hitchens. Posted March 17, 2008. How did I get Iraq wrong? I was a Johnny-come-lately to supporting the Iraq war, persuaded in the eleventh hour by Colin Powell's [famous speech](http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/02/20030205-1.html) to the United Nations laying out the \"evidence\" that Saddam Hussein had stockpiled chemical and biological weapons in violation of [U.N. Resolution 687](http://www.un.org/Depts/unmovic/documents/687.pdf). (Then, as now, I eschewed the misleading propaganda term [weapons of mass destruction](http://www.slate.com/id/2070188/).) In fact, we all learned later, Saddam hadn't stockpiled these weapons. What can I say? Powell was duped, I was duped, and other, more seasoned journalists (including the late Mary McGrory, who wrote [one of her last columns](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32573-2003Feb5.html) about the speech) were duped, too. My column \" [Chatterbox Goes to War](http://www.slate.com/id/2078396/)\" is painful to read five years later, and not only because it contains the fatuous pronouncement, \"No honest person can dispute, after reviewing Powell's satellite photos and telephone intercepts, that Iraq still has\" chemical and biological weapons. The painful truth is that even if those words had been true, they wouldn't have constituted an airtight case for invading Iraq. Far less forgivable, in retrospect, than my smug certainty that Iraq possessed dangerous weapons was my reasoning that this offense left us no alternative to war. We had to invade, I wrote, \"because the Bush administration and the United Nations threw down the gauntlet.\" Had the Bush administration kept secret the \"evidence\" that Iraq had ignored our warning, I argued, it would have been preferable to resolve the matter diplomatically. But since the \"evidence\" was now common knowledge, the United States was obliged to bear arms in defense of its own credibility. In essence, I concluded that the Bush administration had compelled me to support the invasion by maneuvering my country into what felt like an untenable position. What I've learned, and will try to remember from now on, is that defending your country's credibility is never sufficient reason to fight a war. I'd much rather, dear reader, that you read my columns prior to \"Chatterbox Goes to War,\" in which I knocked down various arguments proffered by the hawks. (See, for example, [this column](http://www.slate.com/id/2070747/), and [this These have worn much better. A larger question, though: Why should you waste your time, at this late date, ingesting the opinions of people who were wrong about Iraq? Wouldn't you benefit more from considering the views of people who were right? Five years after this terrible war began, it [remains true](http://www.slate.com/id/2105434/) that respectable mainstream discussion about its lessons is nearly exclusively confined to people who supported the war, even though that same mainstream acknowledges, [for the most part](http://www.slate.com/id/2186740/), that the war was a mistake. That's true of Slate's symposium, and it was true of a [similar symposium](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/opinion/16intro.html?_r=1&ref=opinion&oref=slogin) that appeared March 16 on the New York Times' op-ed pages. The people who opposed U.S. entry into the Iraq war, it would appear, are insufficiently \"serious\" to explain why they were right. Fortunately, this Lewis Carroll logic hasn't prevailed where it matters most: in the race for the Democratic nomination. The front-runner, Barack Obama, is winning primary votes partly on the strength of his having [opposed the Iraq invasion](http://www.barackobama.com/issues/iraq/). Another person who ultimately proved right on Iraq is Mary McGrory. Yes, she got conned along with the rest of us about Saddam's purported stockpile, but if you read her follow-up columns, you'll realize that she never took the next step and declared herself in favor of war. In her [Feb. 13 column](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A398-2003Feb12.html), she wrote: [E]veryone needs a respite from the encircling apprehension and dread. Beginning with the president, all should take a deep breath and reassess. Colin Powell is working overtime to close the loop on Iraq's ties to al Qaeda. In his masterly U.N. speech he made the case against Saddam Hussein, but not the case for war. He needs a rest. The orange alert has worn everybody out. McGrory repeated this sentiment in her [March 6 column](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A48619-2003Mar5.html), addressed to readers who'd misconstrued her Powell column. A couple of weeks later, McGrory suffered a stroke, and 13 months later she [died](http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0422-01.htm). But she leaves behind a [lovely anthology](http://www.amazon.com/Best-Mary-McGrory-Half-Century-Washington/dp/0740760718/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1205957314&sr=1-1), edited by her friend Phil Gailey. It can be read more profitably than this pile of tired mea culpas. How did I get Iraq wrong? Well, for one thing, I trusted the Germans. Those who know me will find this statement somewhat ironic, but there it is. I trusted one German in particular. His name was August Hanning. In the run-up to the war, he was the chief of the BND, the German foreign-intelligence agency. I met him shortly before the war at the new chancellery building opposite the Reichstag in Berlin. He was spectrally thin and exceedingly sober. His briefcase was the size of a microwave oven. I pictured many consequential documents sequestered inside. Despite his cautious nature, Hanning neither hemmed nor hawed when I raised the subject of Saddam's nuclear program: \"It is our estimate that Iraq will have an atomic bomb in three years,\" he said, on the record and for attribution. Apart from Kenneth Pollack's book The Threatening Storm, nothing did more to convince me of the national-security necessity of the Iraq war than Hanning's statement. The BND had apparently developed a good deal of information about what was happening inside Iraq, in part because German companies, especially those that manufactured so-called dual-use products\u2014ones that had both civilian and military applications\u2014did disproportionate business in Baghdad. And Hanning seemed particularly credible to me because his analysis so obviously cut against the desires of his bosses. Then-Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der was vociferously opposed to armed intervention in Iraq. Hanning, in other words, was behaving in precisely the manner in which intelligence analysts should behave. He laid out the truth as he saw it, taking no notice of the personal consequences. To Schr\u00f6der's credit, Hanning was allowed to share his intelligence with the CIA, and by doing so he helped buttress the Anglo-American case for war. He was, of course, wrong. Did this make him a liar? No. It made him an intelligence official. Did this make Gerhard Schr\u00f6der smart? No. It made him lucky. August Hanning was a smart, honest man who made a mistake. If one of my mistakes was to trust men like August Hanning, another larger mistake was to put my trust in the Bush administration, not so much on matters of intelligence\u2014faulty intelligence was a near-universal phenomenon\u2014but on matters of basic competence. I will admit to a prejudice here: I believed\u2014note the tense, please\u2014that Republicans were by nature ruthless, unsentimental, efficient, and, most of all, preoccupied with winning. It simply never occurred to me that Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney would allow themselves to lose a war. Which is what they have very nearly done. The scales fell from my eyes gradually. There was one moment, though\u2014well after the replacement of Saddam's evil regime by the chaos of the Bush regime\u2014that I recall as the end of this particular illusion. I was interviewing Paul Wolfowitz, who was then the deputy secretary of defense, at the New School in New York, as part of the New Yorker Festival in the fall of 2003. The audience was excessively unruly; various protesters were ejected from the hall, some after shouting \"Sieg Heil\" at Wolfowitz. One of these self-marginalizing protesters actually did a running goose step down the aisle until he was tackled by police officers. It felt, at certain moments, as if we had become trapped in a guerrilla theater production of The Producers. This is all by way of explaining that, considering his audience, Wolfowitz did a credible job of keeping his head. But he did not instill a feeling that the administration had a plan in place to manage the Middle East. The key moment came when I asked Wolfowitz whether it was possible that newly democratized Arab countries could wind up voting Islamists into power. Wolfowitz responded, \"Look, 50 percent of the Arab world are women. Most of those women do not want to live in a theocratic state. The other 50 percent are men. I know a lot of them. I don't think they want to live in a theocratic state.\" Shit, I thought. What the world is confronting five years after the invasion\u2014the mess that Gen. David Petraeus is attempting to clean up today\u2014was almost entirely preventable. It's not only my encounters, inside Iraq and outside, with senior figures of the Bush administration that have convinced me of this; the investigations conducted by George Packer, Tom Ricks, Bob Woodward, and Michael Gordon, among others, have unearthed thousands\u2014literally thousands\u2014of mistakes made by this administration, most of which were avoidable. Which makes the last five years a tragic waste. I wanted very much for the liberation of Iraq to succeed, for many reasons. I wasn't sure there was an alternative to Saddam's removal, in part because the sanctions regime was collapsing. I believed that Saddam's nuclear ambitions posed an almost immediate threat to national security. I believed that Saddam was a supporter of terrorism. The report on Saddam's terrorist ties released last week by the Joint Forces Command confirms this (not that you would know it from the scant press coverage of the study). The study, citing captured Iraqi documents, indicates that Saddam's regime supported various jihadist groups, including Ayman al-Zawahiri's, and including Kurdish Islamist groups, about whom I have reported. But [read the study for yourself](http://a.abcnews.com/images/pdf/Pentagon_Report_V1.pdf); it's actually quite an achievement of translation and analysis. Mainly, I believed in the human-rights case for armed intervention. I had spent a good deal of time with Saddam's victims before the war\u2014the Kurds especially\u2014and I had been radicalized by what I learned about the crimes committed against them. I have always sympathized with John Burns' position: He argued, at the outset of the war, that Saddam's regime of torture, rape, and genocide gave cause enough for intervention, without confusing the case with arguments about weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. My Atlantic colleague Andrew Sullivan and I have argued over the notion that travel can actually narrow the mind. I believe in reporting, but I also believe that I was somewhat blinded by my rage at the genocide Saddam perpetrated against Kurdistan. It is difficult to stay neutral on the question of intervention after visiting the survivors of Halabja, Goktapa, and other towns and villages that had been attacked with chemical weapons by Saddam's air force. This is why I find it impossible to denounce a war that led to the removal of a genocidal dictator. To borrow from Samantha Power, the phrase \"never again\" has in recent years come to mean \"Never again will we allow the Germans to kill the Jews in the 1940s.\" The Holocaust proved that the world is a brutal place for small peoples, and it defines for me the nonnegotiable requirements of a moral civilization: to be absolutely intolerant of dictators who have committed documented genocides. The tragedy of this war\u2014one of its tragedies\u2014is that its immorally incompetent execution has, for the foreseeable future, undermined this idea. I believe, for instance, that Darfur demands our armed intervention, but we are now paralyzed because of the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq occupation. A long time ago, I was certain that the Iraq invasion would be seen as a moral victory. Most Americans quite obviously do not see it this way. But on my last trip to Iraq, four months ago, I learned that many of Saddam's victims continue to see the invasion as a triumph of justice. The Kurds, who make up nearly 20 percent of Iraq, remain, by and large, quite pleased with the Anglo-American invasion, which removed from their collective neck a regime that did an excellent job over the years of murdering them. This must count for something, and I'm hopeful that one day, when President Bush is gone and the Kurds are free, it will. You're not my shrink, so I see no reason to bore you with the story of how yet another sorry pundit came to endorse, and later regret, the invasion of Iraq. Instead, I'll try to draw some lessons from the experience. I particularly want to talk to those of you who, like me, would like to understand the errors of this war without renouncing the use of force altogether. \"I don't oppose all wars,\" Barack Obama [declared](http://www.barackobama.com/2002/10/02/remarks_of_illinois_state_sen.php) six years ago. \"What I am opposed to is a dumb war.\" Let's try to flesh out that distinction. 1. Question authority. That's what the Quakers taught me in college. But you don't have to be a pacifist to see how it applies to Iraq. The U.S. government deceived itself and us about the evidence of WMD. I'm a bit too young, or just too poorly read in history, to have absorbed Vietnam's lessons about trusting your government. So I learned it [the hard way](http://www.slate.com/id/2071670/entry/2071703/). I hope my kids don't have to go through another dumb war to get the same lesson. 2. Suspicion can become gullibility. I'm all for suspicion, particularly in foreign relations. The world is full of bad people, and bad people are more likely to claw their way to power in other countries than good people are. But past a certain point, suspicion can make you credulous. This is what happened to Dick Cheney. He was so suspicious of Saddam that he bought\u2014and spread\u2014rumors, lies, and exaggerations about Iraqi WMD. Worse, he failed to recognize his credulity, since he thought he was being suspicious. The next time somebody feeds you rumors in the name of vigilance, remember this. 3. Beware mission creep. Originally, I endorsed the use of force to [put teeth in U.N. weapons inspections](http://www.slate.com/id/2072166/). I figured that the best long-term hope for a peaceful world was an enforceable international system to police WMD. Saddam was jerking around the inspectors. He [had to be punished](http://www.slate.com/id/2096654/), or the system, such as it was, would collapse. That rationale remains valid even if the scofflaw turns out not to have WMD. But if that was the rationale for going in, why disband the Iraqi army? Remaking Iraq was more than the offense justified and more than we could handle. Bush's dad had it right in the Gulf War: Right the wrong, punish the offense, and stop. 4. See new evil. It's easy to hate the tyrant who's thumbing his nose at you. It's harder to see the possibility or likelihood of a worse alternative behind him. I never really thought through the chain of events that would fill the power vacuum created by Saddam's ouster. Neither did Bush. We ended up with insurgency, chaos, and the arrival of \"al-Qaida in Iraq,\" which John McCain now cites as a threat so grave we have to keep scores of thousands of U.S. troops in the country. Before you take out somebody bad, make sure the result won't be worse. 5. Human nature at home is human nature abroad. Conservatives have long preached the dangers of dependency. The more government props up and regulates people, the less they learn to support and regulate themselves. Experience tells me that this principle is true. The problem is that conservatives forgot it at the water's edge. They [propped up](http://www.wusa9.com/news/eyeonwashington/eyeonwashington_article.aspx?storyid=47815) Iraqi society and government. Each time the Iraqis failed to meet scheduled requirements to regulate and support themselves, Bush made excuses and said they needed more American help. The party of welfare reform should look back in amazement and shame at this policy. 6. Judge the warrior. For two years, I had a running debate with my friend David Corn about the war. From our respective seats on the TV show Eye on Washington, he criticized the war while I defended it. We agreed that Bush was a fool. He argued that this flaw was decisive: I had to decide whether to support Bush's war, not the war as I might have preferred it. I replied that liberals shouldn't oppose the war just because Bush was running it. Eventually, I [realized](http://www.wusa9.com/news/eyeonwashington/eyeonwashington_article.aspx?storyid=54724) that the idea of nonpartisanship meant little next to the lethal reality of incompetence. Corn was right: You have to decide whether you trust the administration, not just the idea of the war. Other Republican administrations have passed that test. Not this one. 7. Know your limits. During Kosovo, I defended NATO's decision to bomb from the air instead of sending ground troops. \"By depriving Serbia of the ability to kill allied soldiers, NATO leaders demoralized Serb commanders who had counted on body bags to demoralize citizens in the West,\" I [wrote](http://www.slate.com/id/30876/). \"By taking into account the limits of its own will\u2014the will to endure pain\u2014NATO broke Serbia's.\" In Iraq, I ignored that lesson. So did Bush. He inserted U.S. ground troops and left them there, inviting a parade of body bags that demoralized our nation. 8. Consider the opportunity cost. The problem with dumb war isn't that it's war. The problem is that it costs you the military, economic, and political resources to fight a smart war. Everything Bush wrongly attributed to Iraq turns out to be true of Iran. But we can't confront Iran with the force it probably requires, because we wasted our resources in Iraq. Americans, having been suckered in Iraq, won't accept evidence of Iran's nuclear program. Countries that might have supported us in a strike on Iran won't do so now, since we led them astray. Our coffers have been emptied to pay for the Iraq occupation. Our troops are physically and spiritually exhausted. In the name of strength, Bush has [made us weak](http://www.slate.com/id/2109128/). I wish I'd absorbed these lessons before the war. The best I can do now is remember them before the next one. In 2002, I believed the intelligence painting Iraq as an imminent threat and supported our invasion. In 2003 and 2004, I worried about the growing insurgency and grew dismayed at our counterproductive tactics and strategy, but I still felt the war was a worthy cause. In 2005, I volunteered to [deploy](http://www.slate.com/id/2128621/entry/2128622/) to Iraq as an Army captain\u2014partly because of an implicit threat of involuntary recall, partly because I felt a call to duty, and partly because I felt guilty for not serving when so many of my friends and former comrades-in-arms had done so (often multiple times). I went to Iraq in October 2005 and served a year there as an adviser to the Iraqi police in Baqubah, the provincial capital of Iraq's volatile Diyala province. I remain proud of what we accomplished. In our little corner of the war, I think we made a difference by training the police, equipping them, mentoring their leaders, and doing what we could to [promote](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5484904) the rule of law. Small victories, to be sure, but enough to make us feel our sacrifices had been for something meaningful. But I came home in September 2006 [frustrated](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/opinion/15carter.html) with the strategic direction of the war and [alienated](http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-carter11nov11,0,3015871.story?coll=la-opinion-center) from the country that sent me there. I saw our failures to secure the country and build a new Iraq as proof of the limits of military power\u2014and a sign that America was not omnipotent. Over a beer near Times Square in October 2006, I told George Packer (who had been embedded with my adviser team earlier that year in Baqubah) that I thought the war was now \"unwinnable\"\u2014and that we must implement an adviser-centric strategy. I felt then, and feel today, that America's strategic interests require it to leave Iraq and that the best way to responsibly withdraw was to increasingly put Iraqis in charge of their own counterinsurgency campaign, with U.S. forces nearby to keep a lid on ethno-sectarian violence and continue the fight against al-Qaida in Mesopotamia. A month later, I received news that soured my feelings toward Iraq and the war there even more. To help my team advise the police and navigate Iraq's legal system, I had enlisted Dr. Thaer Kudier al-Qasi, a former Iraqi law professor who spoke five languages and seemed to know every lawyer in Diyala. Thaer took good care of me, teaching me what he could about Iraq, even helping me learn a little Arabic. He believed in our cause, too, and he wanted to build a better Iraq for his three sons. But like many Iraqis, Thaer was fatalistic about his life and country. He smoked compulsively, disdained wearing body armor, and spoke publicly about his work helping U.S. forces. He told me frequently that he was just acting out a play that had already been written. In November 2006, he was kidnapped while walking in Baqubah's central market, presumably by al-Qaida insurgents. Neither the Americans nor his family heard from him again. I was crushed when I received news of Thaer's death in an e-mail. I felt guilty for not doing more to protect him, guilty for allowing Thaer to do so much public work for the rule of law (many U.S. translators wear masks) because that work had made him a target, guilty for not doing more to make Iraq safe, guilty for not winning the war (whatever that means). Thaer's death came to define the war for me. For months afterward, when I looked at Iraq, I saw only death and suffering. Now, five years into the war, I remain torn between my initial support for the invasion, my frustrating experience as an Army officer on the ground, and my skepticism that we can build a viable Iraq. Security has improved, although [it's not clear](http://www.slate.com/id/2177250/) who or what deserves credit. The current reduction in violence has made the prospect of a stable Iraq seem possible, if not necessarily probable, because of the Iraqi government's continuing intransigence. But even if we had the patience and will to stay in Iraq for a generation (and I doubt we have either), I think the time has come to leave. The challenge will be to withdraw more responsibly than we went in. Can you give a State of the Union address before you're president? Barack Obama talked about race in America for 45 minutes in a nearly 5,000-word speech. That was longer than some of the annual presidential addresses, and though, yes, those speeches tend to cover more topics, this one felt like it addressed the actual state of our union more than those dreary January list readings presidents are obligated to perform. The speech was deeply personal. Barack Obama is America. He contains multitudes. He started with the contradiction in the Constitution that celebrated freedom but allowed slavery and continued embracing and exploring contradictions throughout\u2014from his own complex heritage to the complex makeup of the black church to the white immigrant experience. All of this was in the service of addressing the contradiction that threatens to derail his campaign: how he can embrace his former pastor and denounce him at the same time. Can Obama's speech of so many words blot out the YouTube videos of his former pastor Jeremiah Wright saying \" [God damn America](http://youtube.com/watch?v=jc2FCJ7zWEQ)\"? It probably can't as a blunt political matter. Obama didn't answer Wright's rebuke with an equally hot riposte. The speech failed to address head-on Wright's damning of America or any of his other remarks about 9/11 or AIDS. Obama asked for points for political courage for not abandoning Wright, and he should get them. Abandonment would have been more expedient. White blue-collar men in Pennsylvania would have applauded shoving Wright over, and his rock-solid black supporters probably would have understood. But Obama's courage didn't extend to directly taking on the words that have caused such controversy. Instead, Obama was cool and reasoned. At times he sounded like he was giving a graduate lecture in need of editing both for length and tone. He didn't need to refer to Geraldine Ferraro twice. His speech was flying at 30,000 feet, and the dip to the crass political level didn't feel right. It also seemed like a cheap attempt to loop Wright and Ferraro with the same lasso, suggesting a moral equivalence between a former congresswoman's stupid remarks and the stone-cold preaching of hate. Obama should have known that's how it would sound. For a candidate who promises to reach across the aisle, Obama also probably didn't help himself with Republicans by arguing that Ronald Reagan profited from the white anger equivalent to the black anger that gave rise to Wright's remarks. Still, if you're a Democrat, I imagine Obama's speech probably made you feel like you wanted him to be the one you cheer on the convention stage in Denver. Hillary Clinton has been claiming that his candidacy amounts to \"just words\"\u2014and making a pretty good case for it. Today was a speech, too, of course, but it also showed the power of language to move people to common understanding and to persuade, a key presidential trait. It touched on a highly sensitive subject with art and skill and called listeners to the same kind of collective action that Obama has successfully sold all throughout the campaign. Even if you didn't buy everything he said, you might be impressed with a person who can take on such a subject so quickly with such scope. Obama managed to chart the topography of the black church and failures within the African-American community as well as put his finger on the elements of anger that exist in the white community. Remember also that he did all of this while in the middle of a sleep-stealing, gut-punching presidential campaign, which is like writing the speech while riding backward on a flaming unicycle. Obama made several deft pivots in the speech, first seeking to put Wright's remarks in context of the black experience without excusing them and then pinpointing the sense of permanent grievance that will always hold those with Wright's views back. It was an attempt to go beyond simply condemning him but to understand and learn from his paralysis. He then sought to do the same for white anger about African-Americans. It was bold and risky in a way that Obama often claims for his candidacy but rarely achieves, and we got a glimpse of how his attempt to bring people together works in practice rather than merely having to take on faith his assertion that he can do so. He closed his remarks just as expertly with a moving story about a volunteer's selflessness\u2014first in dealing with her cancer-stricken mother and then by devoting her life to helping others\u2014that will likely make \"I'm here because of Ashley\" a rallying cry for his campaign. I found myself wanting to find Ashley and thank her. The penultimate clever pivot was maybe too clever, though. In his speech, Obama decried the YouTube era of politics that reduces everyone to small, grainy clips endlessly replayed on cable news. But if it wasn't for the replaying of Wright's remarks on YouTube, Obama wouldn't have been forced to give the speech on race in the first place. (He ducked a question about Wright during one of the last debates.) And yet if he's claiming the speech as a great act of political courage, then why did he need YouTube to bring it about? This is making a virtue out of necessity, I suppose, but it also seems like he's claiming too much credit for himself. We have a choice, Obama said, about the kind of politics we practice. How we behave next will be a test of whether we will accept a \"politics that breeds division and conflict and cynicism\" or demand something new. That's what he's been preaching all along, so when he warned against continuing to fixate on Wright's remarks and slicing and dicing exit polls for racial data, it seemed like he was calling voters, the press, and his opponents to join him up on the high road he's been riding for a year. But in his list of bad political behavior, he included pouncing \"on some gaffe by a Hillary supporter as evidence that she's playing the race card.\" It was his campaign that [raced to the airwaves to jump on](http://www.slate.com/id/2185180/) a Drudge Report item about a supposed Clinton staffer supposedly passing around a picture of Obama. And it was his staffers who [made the most](http://www.slate.com/id/2186242/) of Geraldine Ferraro's remarks. Obama didn't come out and say that, though, and so in a speech with lots of first pronouns, he missed a chance to talk in a needed way about his own falling short of his standards. It was another contradiction. \"Why did we get it wrong?\" is a loaded, indeed, leading question\u2014one that would not have been quite as loaded and leading in 2004-06 as it is today. Those were the darkest days in the life of post-Saddam Iraq, and they delivered the gravest indictment against the Bush administration. One year after George W. Bush's \"mission accomplished\" speech, U.S. monthly casualties had doubled. By the end of 2006, daily attacks by insurgents and terrorists had quintupled. Monthly multiple-fatality bombings had leapt tenfold from the end of 2003 to the end of 2006. It was a perfect horror story\u2014and one that seemed to demonstrate in the bloodiest manner the folly of Bush's war. Meanwhile, of course, and especially in the wake of the surge, these numbers have gone down just as dramatically. Briefly, there are three explanations. One is Gen. David Petraeus, who boldly changed tactics from hunkering down, plus occasional sallies, to sustained offensive operations. \"Clear and hold\" seems to be working quite well, extending the space in which coalition and Iraqi forces have dislodged the opposition while assuring security for the population. Moreover, the surge signaled that the United States was here to stay\u2014a power factor to be reckoned with. The second factor is the new politics. That shift is perhaps even more profound. Briefly, the United States did the only right thing in a civil-war setting: It began to protect and deter both sides instead of acting, as post-2003, as the handmaiden of Shiite power while de-Baathifying and \"de-Sunnifying\" the country. Faced with the loss of their age-old supremacy (and their livelihood), why wouldn't the Sunnis and Baathists have fought as desperately as they did? And have done so even in cahoots with al-Qaida, et al.? In the last two years, the United States has acted in a more evenhanded way. Essentially, it dispatched two messages. To the Sunnis: You are not alone. To the Shiites: Do not exploit your numerical superiority for wholesale expulsion and slaughter. Add to this political shift the reintegration of Baathists, who were ruthlessly purged by the American viceroy, L. Paul Bremer. They were handed pensions and jobs and were reinvited into the armed forces. The flow of oil money to the Sunni provinces turned the disenfranchised into stakeholders. Thus, physical reassurance went hand-in-glove with promises of a decent economic future. Finally, there is the isolation of al-Qaida and other foreign terrorists. This is not an American achievement but the result of untold brutality and bloodshed on the part of those who would turn Iraq into a global battlefield against the \"Great Satan.\" Instead, they ended up not expelling the United States but terrorizing and alienating the locals. This was not the way to win the hearts and minds of those Iraqis who were supposed to deliver shelter, bases, and support. So in the fifth year of the war, the tide began to turn, albeit for reasons that are not exactly fortuitous. Maybe, five years from now, we will be able to look back and point to Iraq as the first successful counterinsurgency war since the British bested the Malay rebels in the 1950s (though after 12 long years). Still, \"Where did we get it wrong?\" remains a valid and compelling question. Though as a realist, I felt queasy about the \"democratic peace theory\" behind the war (\"only despots make war, while democracies are inherently pacific\"), I hesitantly thought, Why not? Maybe the fall of this horrifying regime would serve as an example to all the other despotisms in the neighborhood. Alas, democracy in one country is not the antidote to the enormous political pathologies of the Middle East, nor should anybody have expected such a miraculous transformation. Even less so, given the cavalier approach of the Bushies and their Pollyanna-ish belief in the ease of regime transformation: We'll topple Saddam, hand over power to a friendly like Ahmad Chalabi, and leave. This is not how West Germany and Japan, where U.S. troops are present to this day, were democratized. The lesson is stark: If you don't will the means, don't will the end. To this Kantianism, let us add pure homily: Look before you leap. The tragedy of American power in the Middle East, the most critical arena of world politics, is that the United States ended up working as the handmaiden of Iranian ambitions. By destroying Saddam's armies, the United States flattened the strongest bulwark against Iranian expansion. By empowering the Shiites, it opened the way to an ideological alliance between Najaf and Qum, the two centers of the faith on either side of the Iraq-Iran border. And by entangling itself in an open-ended war in Iraq, the United States squandered precisely those military assets that would have kept Iran in awe. Would the Ahmadinejad regime grasp so boldly for nuclear weapons if U.S. power and credibility were still intact? So in the business of regime transformation, \"Look before you leap\" translates into: \"Democracy may be good; strategic stability is better.\" It advises future American leaders to worry about power first and about goodness as a byproduct. This is the counsel not of cynicism but of wisdom. If Germany and Japan have anything to teach, it is that security (within and without) must come first if democracy is to come later. Anthrax. Remember anthrax? It seems no one does anymore\u2014at least it's never mentioned. But right after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, letters laced with anthrax were received at the New York Post and Tom Brokaw's office at NBC. In the following days, more anthrax-contaminated letters were received by other news organizations\u2014CBS News and, presumably, ABC, where traces of anthrax were found in the newsroom. Weirdly, even the Sun, a supermarket tabloid, also got a letter, and a photo editor, Bob Stevens, was [fatally infected](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3067576/). Other letters were sent to Sen. Tom Daschle's Capitol Hill office, and in Washington, D.C., a postal worker, Thomas L. Morris Jr., died. There was ample reason to be afraid. The attacks were not entirely unexpected. I had been told soon after Sept. 11 to secure Cipro, the antidote to anthrax. The tip had come in a roundabout way from a high government official, and I immediately acted on it. I was carrying Cipro way before most people had ever heard of it. For this and other reasons, the anthrax letters appeared linked to the awful events of Sept. 11. It all seemed one and the same. Already, my impulse had been to strike back, an overwhelming urge that had, in fact, taken me by surprise on Sept. 11 itself when the first of the Twin Towers had collapsed. I was downtown, rushing toward the World Trade Center, when I heard the building go, a deep, guttural rumble that preceded that hideous tsunami of paper, building material, and, of course, pulverized bodies. From nowhere, I heard someone inside my head say, \"We'll get you, you bastards\"\u2014and it was me. I took myself totally by surprise. In the following days, as the horror started to be airbrushed\u2014no more bodies plummeting to the sidewalk\u2014the anthrax letters started to come, some to people I knew. And I thought, No, I'm not going to sit here passively and wait for it to happen. I wanted to go to \"them,\" whoever \"they\" were, grab them by the neck, and get them before they could get us. One of \"them\" was Saddam Hussein. He had messed around with anthrax; he had twice started wars in the region (Iran and Kuwait); he had massacred the Kurds and the Shiites; used chemical weapons (no doubt about that); had had a nuclear weapons program (also no doubt about that); and was violating U.N. resolution after resolution (absolutely no doubt about that, either). Saddam was a sociopath, a uniformed button man, Luca Brasi of Arabia. He was a nasty little fascist, and he needed to be dealt with. That, more or less, is how I made my decision to support the war in Iraq. It did not take me all that long, however, to have second thoughts\u2014and I expressed them in my [column](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/linkset/2005/03/24/LI2005032401528.html). It was clear that Saddam was unconnected to Osama Bin Laden, that Iraqi intelligence had not met with Mohammed Atta in Prague, and that while Iraq once had a nuclear weapons program, it no longer did. That left chemical and biological weapons, and neither represented much of a threat. Gas had been around since [Ypres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Ypres) (1915), and biological devices were impractical as weapons of mass destruction, although they remained profoundly scary. So, the only justification left was, really, what the neocons had started with: a war to reorder the Middle East. This had a certain appeal, since the region was unstable, undemocratic, repressive, and downright dangerous. Can it be a coincidence that so many of the so-called liberal hawks had spent time in the region? When it came to getting it right on Iraq, ignorance may indeed have been bliss. One final argument appealed to me. It was quite clear that, over time, Saddam would slip the noose of U.N. sanctions, the United States would tire of its campaign to enforce the no-fly zone, the Europeans\u2014so worldly, so repellently even-handed about Israel, so appalled by Saddam's excesses, and, finally, so full of shit\u2014would do business with the regime, and Saddam would be free to use his oil wealth for weapons and war. If something were not done when it seemed that something could be done, then nothing would ever be done\u2014until it was too late. These, then, were my reasons for war\u2014a war, I argued, that need not be imminent and need not be fought virtually alone. I was becoming a lousy, broken-winged hawk, and I certainly would have lost my other wing entirely had I known that the war would not be brief (as promised) but would grind on for more than five years, producing an appalling carnage, a collapse of U.S. prestige, and a boon to Iran. I was not only unprepared for the revelation that Iraq had no WMD whatsoever, but\u2014even more stunning\u2014that such seasoned hands as Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Colin Powell, to name just three veterans of past presidencies, would prove so cosmically incompetent. I was also intent on rectifying a previous mistake. I had been wrong about Bosnia, and I had, in a way that no swift-fingered blogger could ever understand, anguished over Srebrenica and a return to Europe of horrors long thought gone. I had been to Bosnia and seen in its twisting, darkly forested mountain roads a kind of Balkan Ho Chi Min Trail\u2014impossible terrain that the locals could use to stop an army. Stay out, I cautioned. I had learned the wrong lesson from that war, and I also learned a wrong lesson from the first Gulf War, which I had supported. Predictions of a quagmire had not materialized, and neither had predictions that the vaunted Arab street\u2014what we now might call terrorism\u2014would erupt and friendly regimes would topple. The lesson now was that force could actually work and save lives. I had been to Iraq, but I didn't know what I didn't know. One of those things, certainly, is how little we understood the society\u2014an ignorance so profound I don't think 100,000 more troops would have made a difference. We, journalists and government alike, listened to the wrong people and came away smug in ignorance\u2014no one smugger than Rummy. Even with the evidence before his eyes, he saw a nation that was not there. I was miserably wrong in my judgment and somewhat emotional, and whenever my resolve weakened, as it did over time, I steadied myself by downing belts of inane criticism from the likes of Michael Moore or \"realists\" like Brent Scowcroft, who had presided over the slaughter of the Shiites. I favored the war not for oil or empire (what silliness!) or Israel but for all the reasons that made me regret Bosnia, Rwanda, and every other time when innocents were being killed and nothing was done to stop it. I owe it to Tony Judt for [giving me](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n18/judt01_.html) the French ex-Stalinist Pierre Courtade, who, wrongheaded though he might have been, neatly sums it all up for me: \"You and your kind were wrong to be right; we were right to be wrong.\" As a doctor, Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean probably has some familiarity with patients obsessed with their health. That's a good thing, since he now heads a party that is likewise obsessed. As the presidential-nominating fight intensifies and shows no sign of ending, voters and party elites are increasingly worried that the party might not survive the enduring contest. [Mario Cuomo](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601070&sid=aUH0Dx6snd7E&refer=home) said a close race could be \"ruinous\"; House Majority Leader Rep. Steny Hoyer [warned](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/03/hoyer_acknowledges_presidentia.html) of a major fissure; and Donna Brazile [asked](http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1719899,00.html), in Time magazine, \"Who opened up the gates of hell?\" Both Obama and Clinton have developed durable and loyal constituencies. Clinton has secured less-affluent voters and white women, and Obama has built support from liberals, younger voters, and African-Americans. Because the loyalties map along gender and racial lines, the potential for volatility increases, as supporters interpret an attack on the candidate as an attack on themselves. At times, you can sort Obama and Clinton supporters by their grievances\u2014those who were offended when Obama said Clinton was \"likable enough\" or others who took umbrage when Bill Clinton compared Obama to Jesse Jackson. The candidates occasionally promise to play nice, or they speak to each other cordially on the Senate floor. Or they praise each other at the end of debates. But shortly after each peace dance, the war drums start again. Advisers on a seemingly constant round of conference calls raise questions about the rival candidate's honesty, judgment, and temperament. Even if the candidates don't take it personally, their supporters do. The question that now attends each new feint and jab is this: What is the pain threshold for the two constituencies? How much bickering and fighting can each withstand before hard feelings lock in and supporters decide that no matter how many calls for unity they may hear, they will stay home on Election Day if their guy or gal loses\u2014or perhaps even support John McCain. Beyond the daily slights, the Democratic Party seems to have been tricked by Karl Rove or Rumpelstiltskin into designing a delegate-selection process that offers a range of opportunities for Clinton and Obama supporters to feel shortchanged and cheated. The unresolved question of whether to hold do-over elections in Michigan and Florida is one front on which supporters can feel they are somehow getting shortchanged, but that's only an appetizer course for the big meal of woe that activists might have to eat over the role of superdelegates at the party convention in Denver. The proper role of superdelegates is so undefined that either side could feel entitled to moral outrage, though Obama clearly has the advantage in this argument and is trying to exploit it. If superdelegates back Clinton and reverse the will of the pledged delegates who have supported Obama, his voters say they will revolt. \"It will be an explosion,\" agrees John Edwards' strategist, Joe Trippi. Particularly angry will be the first-time voters Obama has brought into the world of national politics with a promise of openness and transparency. Obama supporters are using this threat of an explosion as leverage with the superdelegates, who have the power to avert the nightmare scenario\u2014or give birth to it. \"If the superdelegates intervene and get in the way and say, 'Oh no, we are going to determine what's best,' there will be chaos at the convention,\" said Obama supporter and Richmond, Va., Mayor Douglas Wilder, [who raised the specter of the 1968 convention riots](http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2008/02/sweet_axelrod_wolfson_on_cbs_f_1.html). \"If you think 1968 was bad, you watch 2008. It will be worse.\" When fear of chaos hasn't worked, threats of specific retaliation have been issued. On Meet the Press, Obama supporter Bill Bradley said superdelegates who hold public office will face primary challenges the next time around if they don't follow the expressed will of their constituents. To balance out the pitch, Obama will use the threat of a party crackup in a softer way, using the recent rounds of shoving between the campaigns as a frame for a speech in which he will pitch himself as a conciliator. He will not only be promising Democrats that he has a way to rescue the party from eating itself, but he will try to reinvigorate the power of his rhetoric. Clinton has effectively used Obama's talent for oratory against him in recent weeks, claiming he promises little more than \"just words.\" But in Philadelphia on Tuesday, Obama will try to show how he can effectively address a seemingly intractable problem using the very rhetoric that Clinton has criticized. The Obama camp is hoping for one of two outcomes: Either the nearly 300 remaining uncommitted superdelegates will get spooked and flood to him, putting him over the top for the nomination; or, in a more cinematic move, a handful of superdelegates already pledged to Clinton will defect, go to her, and ask that she stop her campaign to avoid a fight. Obama benefits from the prospect of chaos, but that's not to suggest that his nomination would be pain-free. Clinton's relentless argument that Obama is not ready to be commander in chief may have opened a door for her supporters to back McCain. In a recent Pew Research poll, 25 percent of Hillary's supporters said they would consider voting for McCain, whereas only 10 percent of Obama's supporters said they would consider doing so. Now, this plays in her favor as a competing argument she can make to the supers. Many of Clinton's supporters, particularly women, also warn that they feel Obama has benefited from a [free ride](http://taylormarsh.com/archives_view.php?id=27240) in the press and has taken advantage of barely veiled sexism. Clinton tellingly referred supporters to the analysis of ABC's Cokie Roberts, who said this of the reaction some women have to Obama: \"Here is this woman, she's worked hard, she's done it all the way you're supposed to do it, and then this cute young man comes in and says a bunch of sweet, you know, nothings, and pushes you out of the way. And a lot of women are looking at that and saying, 'There goes my life.' \" There have been hard-fought Democratic primaries before, and delegates have always found a way to pick a nominee. But that person hasn't always gone on to win. In 1968, 1980, and 1984, Democrats fought among themselves and lost to the Republicans in the general election. So, what are this year's party hand-wringers to do? There aren't any easy solutions. Solving the delegate puzzle is in the hands of the risk-averse superdelegates, and lowering the temperature of the daily tit for tat is in the hands of sleep-deprived aides. Perhaps Howard Dean's best move would be to prescribe everyone a sedative. It may be that I don't belong in this forum. I supported the Iraq war for a mere few weeks, from Colin Powell's Feb. 5 [briefing](http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/02/20030205-1.html) to the U.N. Security Council until roughly the end of that month\u2014still well before the invasion began\u2014as Powell's case showed its seams, as the coalition for war unraveled, and, most of all, as the Bush administration revealed itself to be (as I put it in a [column](http://www.slate.com/id/2079678/) on March 5, 2003) \"in no shape\u2014diplomatically, politically, or intellectually to wage [this war] or at least to settle its aftermath.\" For me, the tipping point came on March 3, with a New York Times Magazine [story](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFDE1F3DF931A35750C0A9659C8B63&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink) by George Packer, reporting on a meeting a couple of months earlier between Bush and three Iraqi exiles (including [Kanan Makiya](http://www.slate.com/id/2186763/)). The exiles warned the president that, after Saddam was toppled, the American-led coalition would need to take great care to contain age-old Sunni-Shiite tensions that were sure to flare up once again. Bush seemed puzzled; it was clear that he didn't know what the exiles were talking about. (There were two types of Iraqi Arabs? Wouldn't Saddam's ouster uncork the geyser of freedom and democracy?) War, as Clausewitz wrote, is politics by other means. That is, a war is not won until its political objectives have been secured. It seemed clear, with Packer's article, that Bush\u2014and, as we now know, many of his top aides\u2014had no idea what securing those objectives, and thus winning the war, would entail. It's not that we lacked an \"exit strategy\" (an overrated concept); it's that, beyond the battlefield phase, we lacked a war strategy or any kind of strategy at all. The lack of broad political acumen, which made success seem unlikely, was apparent in the failure to sell the case for invasion to even a two-thirds majority of the U.N. Security Council (the share needed to pass a resolution in the absence of a veto). If Bush & Co. were having such a hard time managing relations with the long-established governments of not just France and Russia but Germany, Chile, and Canada, how were they going to deal with the exotic sectarian factions inside Iraq\u2014especially when the president didn't know they existed? A multilateral consensus is not always a prerequisite to military action. But if the point of a war is not to protect our vital national interests but rather to enforce international law (in this case, security council resolutions), the war is almost sure to go badly without the enforcing entity's support. But enough of how I was right. Where did I go wrong in those first few weeks when I was in favor of war? First, I put too much trust in circumstantial evidence. I was particularly struck by the tape-recording of an intelligence intercept that Powell played\u2014a phone conversation in which one Iraqi Republican Guard officer tells another to clean out a site before the inspectors get there. What else could this mean but that Saddam had a covert chemical-weapons stockpile and that he was deliberately misleading the U.N. team? Well, it turned out (as U.S. interrogators discovered after the war) that the Iraqi officers wanted to make sure that no traces were left of chemical weapons that had been stored in that site back before the 1991 war. They were, ironically, taking pains to stay in compliance with U.N. resolutions demanding disarmament. There is, of course, only so much that citizens without security clearances can know about intelligence data. So, another mistake I made was to put too much trust in those who presented the circumstantial evidence\u2014mainly Colin Powell (who later regretted his role and denounced the officials who hoodwinked him) and certain members of Congress (who were entrusted with the full National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq but read only its executive summary, which omitted all the fine points and footnotes, which we now know revealed much dissent over the NIE's conclusions). I must confess, I was also bent out of shape by my anger at the French and the Russians. Particularly galling was French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin's pronouncement that he would veto any resolution calling for war as its enforcement clause. From that point on, it seemed, Saddam knew that he could keep thumbing his nose at the United Nations with no penalty. There was no longer any hope that a shrewd mix of sticks and carrots might produce a diplomatic settlement. But of course, Saddam wasn't thumbing his nose at U.N. demands to disarm; he had no arms to dismantle. And, as we now know, Bush was already hellbent on going to war. All sides in this debate were using the Security Council's deliberations as a ploy in their respective charades. Many Bush officials were relieved when the French exposed their pretense first. Meanwhile, Saddam abetted his own destruction by pretending that he might have weapons of mass destruction; even many of his own officers believed he did. He played this game of calculated ambiguity in order to appear more powerful to his subjects and neighbors\u2014and, in his mind, to deter a U.S. invasion. Nikita Khrushchev played the same game in the late 1950s when he fibbed that Russia was churning out ICBMs like sausages, in part to deter a U.S. first strike, which he saw as a real danger. Both tricks backfired: President John F. Kennedy ordered his own crash ICBM program; Bush invaded Iraq. There is also a lesson here for our adversaries: Don't try to manipulate an American president's perceptions; your cultural understanding of us is at least as shallow as our cultural understanding of you. I know that I got many things wrong in the run-up to the 2003 war, but, in spite of everything, I still do not know how to regret wanting to knock down the walls of the great concentration camp that was Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The nature of political action is that its consequences are unknowable. That is the source of the wonder, beauty, and ugliness that politics can bring into the world. Should I have let that unknowability determine the morality of the case for the overthrow of the regime in Iraq? Would we have had a moral war in 2003 if there had arisen an Iraqi version of Nelson Mandela, and are we now saddled with an immoral one because he did not appear? I cannot think like that. Perhaps it is incumbent upon those who now regret supporting regime change back in 2003 to tell us what the alternative moral course of action was. Was it to wait and watch until the time bomb that was Saddam Hussein's Iraq blew up in everyone's faces? True, I underestimated the self-centeredness and sectarianism of the Iraqi ruling elite put in power by U.S. military action in 2003. I knew them well, after all. And I underestimated the extent to which Iraqi state institutions had already been dismantled by U.N. sanctions, which changed a totalitarian regime into a criminal regime during the 1990s, long before anyone thought of unseating Saddam Hussein by force. Nor did I ever imagine that the conversion of the Iraqi army into a civil reconstruction force\u2014which is what I and others called for in the run-up to 2003\u2014would be translated into [Paul Bremer's order](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/17/world/middleeast/17bremer.html) for the overnight firing, without pension, of half a million or so men. Certainly, I never imagined the breathtaking incompetence of the American occupation. Then again, I supported de-Bathification, comparing it all too glibly in interviews to de-Nazification. I did so naively, not allowing myself to think that it would be practiced by my fellow Iraqis as de-Sunnification and that the committee in charge of it would behave like an Iraqi version of McCarthy's committee on un-American activities. But my biggest political sin is that in spite of nearly a quarter of a century of writing about the abuses of the Baath Party, I, and more generally the whole community of Iraqi exiles, grossly underestimated the consequences on a society of 30 years of extreme dictatorship. Iraqis were, it is true, liberated by the U.S. action in 2003; they were not defeated as the German and Japanese peoples had been in 1945. A regime was removed and a people liberated overnight, but it was a people that did not understand what had happened to it or why. Iraqis emerged into the light of day in a daze, having been in a prison or a giant concentration camp, cut off from the rest of the world to a degree that is difficult to imagine if you have not lived among them. All of a sudden this raw, profoundly abused population, traumatized by decades of war, repression, uprisings, and brutal campaigns of social extermination, was handed the opportunity to build a nation from scratch. True, they were adept at learning the most arresting symbols of their re-entry into the world\u2014the mobile phone and the satellite dish, for example. But it proved infinitely harder to get rid of the mistrust, fear, and unwillingness to take initiative or responsibility that was ingrained into a people by a whole way of survival in police-state conditions. No one made allowances for the deleterious consequences of all this on reconstruction, identity-formation, and nation-building. Is that an argument for, or against, regime change in 2003? An \"anniversary\" of a \"war\" is in many ways the least useful occasion on which to take stock of something like the Anglo-American intervention in Iraq, if only because any such formal observance involves the assumption that a) this is, in fact, a war and b) it is by that definition an exception from the rest of our engagement with that country and that region. I am one of those who, for example, believes that the global conflict that began in August 1914 did not conclusively end, despite a series of \"fragile truces,\" until the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union. This is not at all to redefine warfare and still less to contextualize it out of existence. But when I wrote the essays that go to make up [A Long Short War: The Postponed Liberation of Iraq](http://www.amazon.com/Long-Short-War-Postponed-Liberation/dp/0452284988/), I was expressing an impatience with those who thought that hostilities had not really \"begun\" until George W. Bush gave a certain order in the spring of 2003. Anyone with even a glancing acquaintance with Iraq would have to know that a heavy U.S. involvement in the affairs of that country began no later than 1968, with the role played by the CIA in the coup that ultimately brought Saddam Hussein's wing of the Baath Party to power. Not much more than a decade later, we come across persuasive evidence that the United States at the very least acquiesced in the Iraqi invasion of Iran, a decision that helped inflict moral and material damage of an order to dwarf anything that has occurred in either country recently. In between, we might note minor episodes such as Henry Kissinger's faux support to Kurdish revolutionaries, encouraging them to believe in American support and then abandoning and betraying them in the most brutal and cynical fashion. If you can bear to keep watching this flickering newsreel, it will take you all the way up to the moment when Saddam Hussein, too, switches sides and courts Washington, being most in favor in our nation's capital at the precise moment when he is engaged in a campaign of extermination in the northern provinces and retaining this same favor until the very moment when he decides to \"engulf\" his small Kuwaiti neighbor. In every decision taken subsequent to that, from the decision to recover Kuwait and the decision to leave Saddam in power to the decisions to impose international sanctions on Iraq and the decision to pass the [Iraq Liberation Act of 1998](http://www.iraqwatch.org/government/US/Legislation/ILA.htm), stating that long-term coexistence with Saddam's regime was neither possible nor desirable, there was a really quite high level of public participation in our foreign policy. We were never, if we are honest with ourselves, \"lied into war.\" We became steadily more aware that the option was continued collusion with Saddam Hussein or a decision to have done with him. The president's [speech to the United Nations](http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/09/20020912-1.html) on Sept. 12, 2002, laying out the considered case that it was time to face the Iraqi tyrant, too, with this choice, was easily the best speech of his two-term tenure and by far the most misunderstood. That speech is widely and wrongly believed to have focused on only two aspects of the problem, namely the refusal of Saddam's regime to come into compliance on the resolutions concerning weapons of mass destruction and the involvement of the Baathists with a whole nexus of nihilist and Islamist terror groups. Baghdad's outrageous flouting of the resolutions on compliance (if not necessarily the maintenance of blatant, as opposed to latent, WMD capacity) remains a huge and easily demonstrable breach of international law. The role of Baathist Iraq in forwarding and aiding the merchants of suicide terror actually proves to be deeper and worse, on the latest professional estimate, than most people had ever believed or than the Bush administration had ever suggested. This is all overshadowed by the unarguable hash that was made of the intervention itself. But I would nonetheless maintain that this incompetence doesn't condemn the enterprise wholesale. A much-wanted war criminal was put on public trial. The Kurdish and Shiite majority was rescued from the ever-present threat of a renewed genocide. A huge, hideous military and party apparatus, directed at internal repression and external aggression was (perhaps overhastily) dismantled. The largest wetlands in the region, habitat of the historic Marsh Arabs, have been largely recuperated. Huge fresh oilfields have been found, including in formerly oil free Sunni provinces, and some important initial investment in them made. Elections have been held, and the outline of a federal system has been proposed as the only alternative to a) a sectarian despotism and b) a sectarian partition and fragmentation. Not unimportantly, a battlefield defeat has been inflicted on al-Qaida and its surrogates, who (not without some Baathist collaboration) had hoped to constitute the successor regime in a failed state and an imploded society. Further afield, a perfectly defensible case can be made that the Syrian Baathists would not have evacuated Lebanon, nor would the Qaddafi gang have turned over Libya's (much higher than anticipated) stock of WMD if not for the ripple effect of the removal of the region's keystone dictatorship. None of these positive developments took place without a good deal of bungling and cruelty and unintended consequences of their own. I don't know of a satisfactory way of evaluating one against the other any more than I quite know how to balance the disgrace of Abu Ghraib, say, against the digging up of Saddam's immense network of mass graves. There is, however, one position that nobody can honestly hold but that many people try their best to hold. And that is what I call the [Bishop Berkeley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley) theory of Iraq, whereby if a country collapses and succumbs to trauma, and it's not our immediate fault or direct responsibility, then it doesn't count, and we are not involved. Nonetheless, the very thing that most repels people when they contemplate Iraq, which is the chaos and misery and fragmentation (and the deliberate intensification and augmentation of all this by the jihadists), invites the inescapable question: What would post-Saddam Iraq have looked like without a coalition presence? The past years have seen us both shamed and threatened by the implications of the Berkeleyan attitude, from Burma to Rwanda to Darfur. Had we decided to attempt the right thing in those cases (you will notice that I say \"attempt\" rather than \"do,\" which cannot be known in advance), we could as glibly have been accused of embarking on \"a war of choice.\" But the thing to remember about Iraq is that all or most choice had already been forfeited. We were already deeply involved in the life-and-death struggle of that country, and March 2003 happens to mark the only time that we ever decided to intervene, after a protracted and open public debate, on the right side and for the right reasons. This must, and still does, count for something. The journalism of New Yorker staff writer Malcolm Gladwell has attracted millions of readers. His first book, The Tipping Point, has been on the New York Times paperback nonfiction best-seller [list ](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/23/books/bestseller/0323bestpapernonfiction.html?)for 186 weeks and his second, Blink, for 49 weeks. Live audiences delight in his work, too. In late 2005, he won giggles and horselaughs from the crowd at [The Moth](http://www.themoth.org/ball), a New York storytellers' forum, recounting his comic adventures as a rookie newspaper reporter at the Washington Post. Public radio's This American Life heard a recording of the Gladwell talk and approached him for permission to air it. After slight editing for broadcast, the talk ran on the show last month ( [podcast here](http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=348); unexpurgated version [streamed here](http://psc-fileserver.prod2.podshowcreator.com/E68777C69384489383CC343F4CFC22A9.mp3)). At its conclusion, This American Life host Ira Glass identifies The Moth as a place where \"people come to tell both true stories and occasional tall tales.\" Which is Gladwell telling? Though he plays his material for laughs, Gladwell encourages listeners to believe him by filling the talk with verisimilitude-building detail. Not once does he interrupt himself to say, You shouldn't really be taking this seriously. Instead, at one point he urges listeners to \"look it up\" in the Post archives if they doubt one of his newspaper exploits. But the talk isn't verifiable. It's mostly bunk. When I interviewed him, Gladwell protested that nobody who knows anything about The Moth would ever take literally a story told there. \"No one fact checks Moth stories, or expects them to stand up to skeptical scrutiny,\" he e-mails. His story, while based on real events, \"is not supposed to be 'true,' in the sense that a story in the New York Times is supposed to be 'true.' \" He continues, \"It's a yarn. In this case, it's an elaborate joke: it's a send-up of the seriousness with which journalists take themselves.\" If it's an elaborate joke, no writer appears to get it. In 2005, the New York Post's \" [Page Six](http://page6.com/story/every+writer's+inner+fake)\" took his Moth presentation at face value, as did Chris Wilson, the author of a 2006 Washingtonian [profile](http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/3044.html) of Gladwell, who wasn't discouraged by Gladwell to think otherwise. If the monologue had remained an insider thing, heard mostly by Moth habitu\u00e9s, one could sympathize with Gladwell's position. Nobody but a prig would wag his finger at Gladwell for telling stories wherever he can muster an audience. But by moving his tale from The Moth's clubby confines to the radio show's national audience of 1.7 million, the broadcast on This American Life changed the equation. The blog Jossip accepted the radio riff as nonfiction and published an item [titled](http://www.jossip.com/malcolm-gladwell-laughs-at-journalism-20080219/) \"Malcolm Gladwell Laughs at Journalism: The Joke Is on Us.\" [Gawker](http://gawker.com/358275/malcolm-gladwells-newspaper-daze) bought the story, too, as did a [dozen](#2186983) bloggers and commenters. Since cock-and-bull about how he behaved at the Washington Post is being taken seriously, worming its way into the record, a detailed debunking is called for if only to explain that newspapers don't tolerate shenanigans like this. So, allow me to volunteer to be the literal-minded plodder who charts the many things in Gladwell's talk that never happened or never happened the way he describes them. The embellishments begin at the top of his monologue when Gladwell calls his Post gig his \"first real job\" and confides, \"I still don't know really how I got hired because I didn't have any newspaper experience. I hadn't even worked for my high-school newspaper.\" This is a complete pose. The Post has long hired writers with no daily experience, including Sally Quinn, Nicholas Lemann, Sidney Blumenthal, Marjorie Williams, Steve Coll, Katherine Boo, and many [others](#2186985). Upon joining the Post in the summer of 1987, Gladwell had as much experience as many daily rookies at the Post. While still an undergraduate, he completed a [journalism](http://njc.yaf.org/graduates/books.cfm) internship in Washington, D.C. In 1984, he became an assistant managing editor at the American Spectator, where he also wrote, and after a stopover at a think tank went to Insight magazine as a reporter. While there, he covered business and also freelanced for the New Republic. The bosses at the American Spectator (Wlady Pleszczynski) and Insight (John Podhoretz) remember Gladwell as a talented writer and thinker. That Gladwell got a Post slot comes as no surprise to me or anybody else who knew him. Then why then does he cast himself as such a greenhorn and portray his hiring as a mystery? My guess is that he knows it's much funnier for a na\u00eff\u2014rather than a sharpie\u2014to run amok inside an august institution, which is what he proceeds to describe in the rest of his talk. Gladwell claims at The Moth that publication of his first Post piece, an earnings story about a company named Maryland Biosciences, caused total mayhem at the paper. \"Unfortunately, I wrote that the firm lost $5 million in the previous quarter, and they, in fact, had made $5 million in the previous quarter,\" he says. This error caused the company's stock to drop 10 points, Gladwell says, and prompted the company's CEO to call Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee and \"chew him out.\" The paper placed Gladwell on probation, too, he says. A reportorial screw-up that moved a stock 10 points surely would have made news, yet I can find no record of the incident in the Washington Post, Nexis, or elsewhere. I can't even find a trace of \"Maryland Biosciences.\" Ben Bradlee could not recall the incident Gladwell describes when interviewed, nor could Frank Swoboda, who ran the Post business section at the time. Swoboda says he would remember if Gladwell had been put on probation, which he doesn't. Like some of the tall tales in Gladwell's talk, this anecdote contains a sliver of truth. Gladwell mistakenly reported in an Aug. 25, 1987, Post story\u2014not his first\u2014that ERC International lost $3.8 million the previous year when it had actually made $337,000. A correction followed in the next day's paper. (ERCI was a Fairfax, Va., firm that did defense and energy work.) If Gladwell's high jinks ended here, who would make a fuss? But from his apocryphal kernel, Gladwell grows an \"epiphany\" about journalism, one that kept him in the profession. He states: I realized, first of all, that I had made up this story, right, but I had gotten it into the paper, and no one had stopped me. And secondly, secondly I had moved the stock 10 points. It was a kind of Jayson Blair moment. And all of a sudden there is a little glimmer, and I can begin to see that there is some hope in this profession and this thing that didn't make sense to me is now kind of making sense. Gladwell doesn't explain the exact nature of his epiphany, or of his Jayson Blair moment, but it appears to be something about it being OK to play games with news stories, which he claims to have done in his next Post anecdote. He says that after being transferred to the Post health and science beat, he wrote that Sydney, Australia, was under consideration as a host for the next international AIDS convention\u2014even though it wasn't. Remember, making up something like this is grounds for dismissal at most publications. Why did he pick Sydney? Gladwell considered the conference assignment \"a week's paid vacation,\" and he preferred Sydney over the genuine contending cities because he had never visited it. So, I'm writing up the story, and I thought, would anyone mind? So I just said, \"NIH officials said they were considering Rome, Vancouver, Amsterdam, and Sydney.\" Indeed, Nexis confirms that Gladwell included Sydney as a contender in his Aug. 17, 1991, Post piece about the upcoming conference. (His Post article actually names London, Madrid, and Montreal as the other contenders\u2014which they were. The 1992 conference ultimately went to [Amsterdam](http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2145495).) Was Sydney a product of Gladwell's devilish imagination, as he claims, or a real contender? Gladwell wouldn't say when I asked. At least two publications mentioned Sydney as a possible AIDS conference site before Gladwell did. The June 29, 1991, edition of the Economist reported that a \"convention centre has been booked in Sydney as an alternative\" for the 1992 AIDS conference, and a Sept. 28, 1990, Science story cited an authority who called both London and Sydney possible venues. After the Post published his Sydney story, Gladwell says the news wires \"picked up the story and called the Sydney tourist bureau\" to assess the city's interest in hosting the event, and \"the Miami Herald picked up the story and called the NIH.\" If the Herald and the wires ever reported anything about Sydney's \"prospects,\" Nexis can't retrieve it. I asked a Herald employee to check the paper's internal database for such a story, on the chance that Nexis missed it. He came up empty-handed. Gladwell glories in his Sydney \"prank,\" telling the audience: And I, kind of, I can't tell you how much, sort of, how exhilarated this makes me. And I have a sense of real power for the first time. He flexes his newly acquired power by challenging Post colleague William Booth, also a science and health reporter, to a journalistic duel. The object is to determine who can insert the phrase \"raises new and troubling questions\" in his stories the most often over a month. Gladwell strikes first in the \"contest,\" but it's then \"back and forth\" like \"a horse race\" until he leads 10-9. On the last day, Booth wins the game with a \"twofer,\" as the phrase appears in both his piece and its headline. \"I feel like I've been kicked in the stomach; it's devastating,\" Gladwell says. But no Gladwell-Booth \"contest\" ever took place, according to Booth. \"What I remember is that we joked in the science pod about such a contest but there was no formal contest. That is my memory. Malcolm may recall the early 1990s differently,\" Booth responds to a query. This much is true: In May and June of 1989, Gladwell wrote four bylined stories in the Post containing variations on the phrase \"raises troubling issues.\" Booth never penned any variation on the phrase in the Post until years later, and the phrase has never appeared in a Booth headline. Gladwell's account of the \"troubling questions\" duel has grown in the telling. In a 1996 Slate \" [Diary](http://www.slate.com/id/3689/entry/24537/),\" Gladwell claims that such a duel with an unnamed reporter ran a week. \"I think I scored a four,\" he writes. After his \"defeat\" at the hands of Booth, Gladwell says he challenged his friend to a \"championship round\" in which they battled to insert the phrase \"perverse and often baffling\" into their stories. Chris Wilson, author of the December 2006 [Washingtonian](http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/3044.html) profile of Gladwell and now an editorial assistant at Slate, listened to the original Moth talk for his piece. In it, he writes that Gladwell's \"friends' recollections\" and the talk \"paint a picture of a reporter who bent the rules and occasionally snapped them in half.\" Gladwell made no effort to either discourage or encourage the inclusion of the \"perverse and often baffling\" anecdote in the profile, Wilson says. Back to the Moth talk: Billy [Booth] did a piece on mollusks once, in which he wrote, he tried to claim that mollusks represented a perverse and often baffling something. And the copy desk took out \"often,\" arguing, I think correctly, that mollusks were either baffling or they weren't. No variation of the phrase \"perverse and often baffling\" can be found in any Post story by Booth, according to Nexis. In the Moth talk, Gladwell says he won this championship round on Sept. 21, 1992. \"You can look it up, right on the front page,\" he says, where he claims to have written: Washington D.C. has more gastroenterologists per capita than any other city in the country, but in a reflection of the perverse and often baffling economics of the health care profession, it simultaneously has the highest doctor's fees in the country. Well, sorta. Gladwell wrote a Page One story about the District's \"doctor glut,\" but it ran on July 8, 1989, not Sept. 21, 1992. The slightly different phrase \"often perverse and baffling economics\" appears in the 1989 story, but 1,200 words away from the gag line \"gastroenterologist.\" (Gladwell tells a version of this in his Slate \"Diary,\" too.) After Gladwell \"wins\" the contest, he says that \"Billy is devastated. I am triumphant.\" And another sort of epiphany occurs. Gladwell says: All those doubts about journalism melt away, and I say, \"This thing called newspaper writing, I can do it.\" This American Life host Ira Glass gives no indication that any part of Gladwell's performance is fictional when he breaks in to end the Gladwell segment. Instead, he encourages young listeners not to follow Gladwell's example. \"By the way, if there is any ambiguity in here at all, young journalists, please note, putting false information into the newspaper is wrong,\" Glass says. Gladwell distances himself from the decision to air the story on This American Life, saying it wasn't his idea, and adds that they promised to run a disclaimer. \"This American Life told me that they would run a disclaimer at the end of my story, telling listeners not to treat what I said as gospel. I'm not sure I'm responsible for people whose literal mindedness overrides both disclaimers and fairly obvious adventures in tall-tale-telling,\" he e-mails. Ira Glass of This American Life says via e-mail that the show agreed to include a comment at the end\u2014about The Moth being a place where \"people come to tell both true stories and occasional tall tales\"\u2014to indicate that the talk \"contained elements of exaggeration or untruth.\" As disclaimers go, Glass' is weak, something he acknowledges. \"It seemed best for the story if this were kept a little vague,\" writes Glass. \"I thought it would be lousy and undermining and killjoyish if\u2014at the end of a story\u2014a radio host came on and said 'that wasn't true.' Seemed nicer and more artful to simply raise the possibility that it might or might not be true. I figured: the audience is smart. A little goes a long way.\" Gladwell's spiel works not because the stories are particularly funny but because of his reputation as a reliable, meticulous journalist. Puncture the illusion that he's telling the truth, and the laughs leak into the ether. A storyteller can't have it both ways, instructing listeners to \"look it up\" while stretching the yarn beyond the breaking point or claiming that smuggling the \"baffling\" phrase into Post copy became \"literally\" an \"obsession.\" Gladwell's method, and his decision to let This American Life air his tale, raises ... well, new and troubling questions about his attitude toward his audience. Gladwell isn't having any of it. \"My story was true in spirit,\" he e-mails. \"The details were happily and gleefully and deliberately exaggerated and embellished and made up by me\u2014and I am quite sure that not a single person in the audience the night I told it thought otherwise. Anyone who would fact check a tall tale like that either has no sense of humor or is on crack.\" On March 13, after I interviewed him, Gladwell had second thoughts about his Moth talk, qualifying it on [his blog](http://gladwell.typepad.com/gladwellcom/2008/03/tall-tales.html) with these words: There is a disclaimer at the end of the This American Life broadcast, to the effect that the Moth is a place where \"people come to tell both true stories and occasional tall tales.\" As I think should be obvious if you listen to it, my story definitely belongs to the \"tall tale\" category. I hope you enjoy it. But please do so with a rather large grain of salt. ****** Disclosure: Chris Wilson now works at Slate, but he did not bring this story to my attention. A Slate reader did.

The NCAA Tournament is under way, and it's reportedly luring diligent workers away from their desks to manage office pools and watch their favorite teams\u2014to the great detriment of the U.S. economy. In a 2006 \"Press Box,\" reprinted below, Jack Shafer revealed that speculation about how much the productivity of the U.S. economy suffers during March Madness amounts to nothing more than fuzzy math and hype. Also, in a 2006 \"Dismal Science,\" Jeff Merron [explained](http://www.slate.com/id/2138123/) how those workplace-interruptions calculations are taken out of context. If you believe what you read in the press, fan devotion to March Madness could cost employers $3.8 billion or more in lost productivity as workers slip away to check NCAA Tournament scores, participate in office pools, read stories about the contests, or avail themselves to CBS' free streaming [videocasts](http://www.ncaasports.com/mmod) of the games on their office computers. Such prominent news sources as the [Arkansas Democrat-Gazette](http://www.nwanews.com/adg/News/148911/), the [Daily Press](http://www.dailypress.com/news/local/dp-87098sy0mar16,0,5900346.story?coll=dp-news-local-final) of News, the [Washington Post](http://www.mailtribune.com/archive/2006/0317/biz/stories/03biz.htm), the [Miami Herald](http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/14092160.htm), the San Jose Mercury Sun](http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/bal-te.sp.ncaaviewing13mar13,0,6645784.story?coll=bal-home-headlines), the [Las Vegas Review-Journal](http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Mar-13-Mon-2006/business/6243499.html), the the [Boston Globe](http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2006/03/01/during_ncaa_tourney_bet_on_a_loss_in_productivity/) publicized the $3.8 billion estimate contained in a Feb. 28 press release by consultant John A. Challenger, CEO of Challenger, Gray, & Christmas. Challenger's quotable release made immediate news in the March 1 Boston Globe under the headline \"Workers Take Break for NCAA Tournament.\" Other media outlets followed the Globe's lead, churning out headlines such as \"During NCAA Tourney, Bet on a Loss in Productivity\"; \"Chore a Bore, the Score?\"; \"Will Tourney and \"NCAA Cuts Into Workers' Output.\" According to Challenger, businesses would feel the first hit of March Madness on March 13, after the selection committee announced the qualifying teams and workers organized office pools. Challenger arrived at his $3.8 billion estimate based on an average wage of $18 an hour and 58 million college basketball fans spending 13.5 minutes online each of the 16 business days from March 13 through April 3, the day of the championship game. He also allowed that his figure might be conservative! \"The cost may end up being much higher, since it will now be possible to watch entire games on the Internet,\" he stated in the release. But as Jeff Merron [argued in Slate](http://www.slate.com/id/2138123/) last week, lost productivity estimates are almost always bogus, especially when they come from attention-seeking professionals who are in the business of increasing productivity. Challenger, Gray, & Christmas helps companies \"manage\" plant closings, among other things. I'm happy to report that Challenger's estimate is as loosey-goosey as they come. For one thing, he misjudges the size of the dedicated college hoops audience. In 2005, for instance, the NCAA championship game drew 23.1 million households, according to Nielsen. The year before, only 16.6 million households tuned in to the championship game, which indicates that many so-called fans have only a casual interest in the tournament. Many are happy to tune out the tournament's biggest game if it's a blowout, or if the matchup doesn't interest them. Also, many nonfans and casual fans who participate in office pools experience reduced interest in the tournament as it proceeds and the teams they bet on get knocked out. In concocting his lost-productivity estimate, Challenger doesn't acknowledge that \"wasted time\" is built into every workday. Workers routinely shop during office hours, take extended coffee breaks, talk to friends on the phone, enjoy long lunches, or gossip around the water cooler. It's likely that NCAA tourney fans merely reallocate to the games the time they ordinarily waste elsewhere. Likewise, many office workers who don't complete their tasks by the end of the day stay late or take work home. If fans who screw off at work ultimately do their work at home, the alleged \"loss\" to productivity would be a wash. Last, the fear that millions of workers will waste time watching the games live for hours at the office is groundless. More than two-thirds of the games are played on weeknights or weekends, when very few employees are stuck behind their work terminals. Besides, the CBS system can only accommodate 200,000 computers at a time, as the Daily Press noted in its story. My unsolicited advice to my press colleagues is to beware of grand estimates such as Challenger's, and to anxious supervisors, I counsel you to worry less about how your employees waste time and more about how much they screw off. Addendum, March 21, 9:30 a.m.: Carl Bialik, \"The Numbers Guy\" columnist at the Wall Street Journal, beat me to the Challenger story [earlier this month](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB114183387483792619.html), nailing the consultant. Bialik's [2005 column](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB111107526788482378.html) ridiculed the \"consultant\" for [estimating](http://money.cnn.com/2005/03/10/news/economy/marchmadness/) the productivity loss from the 2005 NCAA tournament at $889 million. A $3 billion increase in one year? Get out of here! Bialik also whacked Challenger for his 2005 estimate that Super Bowl water-cooler talk would cost $1.06 billion.

(E-mail may be quoted by name unless the writer stipulates otherwise.) Today, revelers will drink green beer (and [eat corned beef](http://www.slate.com/id/2138120/)) in celebration of the man who, according to David Plotz, \"didn't rid the land of snakes, didn't compare the Trinity to the shamrock, and wasn't even Irish.\" In a 2000 piece reprinted below, Plotz stripped the myth away from St. Patrick, evaluating the many different popular incarnations that have arisen in the years since his birth. Today we raise a glass of warm green beer to a fine fellow, the Irishman who didn't rid the land of snakes, didn't compare the Trinity to the shamrock, and wasn't even Irish. St. Patrick, who died 1,507, 1,539, or 1,540 years ago today\u2014depending on which unreliable source you want to believe\u2014has been adorned with centuries of Irish blarney. Innumerable folk tales recount how he faced down kings, negotiated with God, tricked and slaughtered Ireland's reptiles. The facts about St. Patrick are few. Most derive from the two documents he probably wrote, the autobiographical Confession and the indignant Letter to a slave-taking marauder named Coroticus. Patrick was born in Britain, probably in Wales, around 385 A.D. His father was a Roman official. When Patrick was 16, seafaring raiders captured him, carried him to Ireland, and sold him into slavery. The Christian Patrick spent six lonely years herding sheep and, according to him, praying 100 times a day. In a dream, God told him to escape. He returned home, where he had another vision in which the Irish people begged him to return and minister to them: \"We ask thee, boy, come and walk among us once more,\" he recalls in the Confession. He studied for the priesthood in France, then made his way back to Ireland. He spent his last 30 years there, baptizing pagans, ordaining priests, and founding churches and monasteries. His persuasive powers must have been astounding: Ireland fully converted to Christianity within 200 years and was the only country in Europe to Christianize peacefully. Patrick's Christian conversion ended slavery, human sacrifice, and most intertribal warfare in Ireland. (He did not banish the snakes: Ireland never had any. Scholars now consider snakes a metaphor for the serpent of paganism. Nor did he invent the Shamrock Trinity. That was an 18th-century fabrication.) According to Thomas Cahill, author of How the Irish Saved Civilization, Paddy's influence extended far beyond his adopted land. Cahill's book, which could just as well be titled How St. Patrick Saved Civilization, contends that Patrick's conversion of Ireland allowed Western learning to survive the Dark Ages. Ireland pacified and churchified as the rest of Europe crumbled. Patrick's monasteries copied and preserved classical texts. Later, Irish monks returned this knowledge to Europe by establishing monasteries in England, Germany, France, Switzerland, and Italy. The Irish have celebrated their patron saint with a quiet religious holiday for centuries, perhaps more than 1,000 years. It took the United States to turn St. Patrick's Day into a boozy spectacle. Irish immigrants first celebrated it in Boston in 1737 and first paraded in New York in 1762. By the late 19th century, the St. Patrick's Day parade had become a way for Irish-Americans to flaunt their numerical and political might. It retains this role today. The scarcity of facts about St. Patrick's life has made him a dress-up doll: Anyone can create his own St. Patrick. Ireland's Catholics and Protestants, who have long feuded over him, each have built a St. Patrick in their own image. Catholics cherish Paddy as the father of Catholic Ireland. They say that Patrick was consecrated as a bishop and that the pope himself sent him to convert the heathen Irish. (Evidence is sketchy about both the bishop and pope claims.) One of the most popular Irish Catholic stories holds that Patrick bargained with God and got the Big Fella to promise that Ireland would remain Catholic and free. Ireland's Protestant minority, by contrast, denies that Patrick was a bishop or that he was sent by Rome. They depict him as anti-Roman Catholic and credit him with inventing a distinctly Celtic church, with its own homegrown symbols and practices. He is an Irish hero, not a Catholic one. Outside Ireland, too, Patrick has been freely reinterpreted. Evangelical Protestants claim him as one of their own. After all, he read his Bible, and his faith came to him in visions. Biblical inspiration and personal revelation are Protestant hallmarks. Utah newspapers emphasize that Patrick was a missionary sent overseas to convert the ungodly, an image that resonates in Mormon country. New Age Christians revere Patrick as a virtual patron saint. Patrick co-opted Druid symbols in order to undermine the rival religion, fusing nature and magic with Christian practice. The Irish placed a sun at the center of their cross. \"St. Patrick's Breastplate,\" Patrick's famous prayer (which he certainly did not write) invokes the power of the sun, moon, rocks, and wind, as well as God. (This is what is called \"Erin go hoo-ha.\") Patrick has even been enlisted in the gay rights cause. For a decade, gay and lesbian Irish-Americans have sought permission to march in New York's St. Patrick's Day Parade, and for a decade they have lost in court. Cahill, among others, has allied Patrick with gays and lesbians. Cahill's Patrick is a muscular progressive. He was a proto-feminist who valued women in an age when the church ignored them. He always sided with the downtrodden and the excluded, whether they were slaves or the pagan Irish. If Patrick were around today, Cahill says, he would join the gay marchers. Now television has invented yet another Patrick. Last night, Fox Family Channel aired its made-for-TV movie St. Patrick. Fox's Patrick is mostly drawn from the historical record, but the producers added one new storyline. The English parent church demands that Patrick collect its church taxes in Ireland. Patrick rebels and risks excommunication by the British bishop. The fearless colonist leads a tax revolt against the villainous English. We Americans, like everyone else, think St. Patrick is one of us. An outbreak of E. coli isn't usually the stuff of feel-good stories. Feel-bad is more like it\u2014or even feel-organ-failure. But recent E. coli outbreaks can offer us a bit of solace. We live in the anxious age of synthetic biology, when scientists can reconstruct entire genomes from raw chemicals, and when we all fret that someone is going to use this new technology to create a monster bug and unleash a man-made plague. According to one government report, \" [The effects of some of these engineered biological agents could be worse than any disease known to man](http://www.counterpunch.org/montague12312005.html).\" But a close look at recent outbreaks of E. coli\u2014and a closer look at the bacteria themselves\u2014may help us to put aside our fears for the moment. Engineering plagues is harder than it looks. In 2006, a pair of major E. coli outbreaks swept across the country. One was carried on spinach, the other on lettuce. The spinach outbreak caused [204 illnesses and three deaths](http://www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/spinach.html). The [lettuce outbreak](http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2006/december/121406.htm) made 71 people sick. In both outbreaks, many people had to be rushed to the hospital. Some got away with just bloody diarrhea. In other cases, the bacteria released toxins into the bloodstream that caused kidneys and other organs to shut down. The same strain was behind both cases as well as most other recent outbreaks of E. coli. It's known as [E. coli O157:H7](http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/escherichiacoli_g.htm), named for some of the molecules on its surface. It emerged in the 1980s as a nasty pathogen found mostly in tainted hamburger meat. It lives comfortably (and harmlessly) in cows and other mammals, but if it gets into a human host, it sometimes wreaks havoc. When animals shed the bacteria in their manure, the pathogen can make its way onto crops, and in recent years it has contaminated not just hamburger meat, spinach, and lettuce but apples and bean sprouts. In addition to the occasional major outbreak, it causes a steady stream of illnesses\u2014about 75,000 a year in the United States\u2014that attract less attention. Scientists noticed that the most recent outbreaks were particularly brutal. The bug from 2006 sent three to four times more people than expected to the hospital. Typically, only 4 percent of people who get infected with E. coli O157:H7 suffer the worst form of the disease, in which toxins are released into the bloodstream. As many as 15 percent did in 2006. This worrisome trend led a team of scientists based at Michigan State University to take a look at the DNA of the bacteria. The researchers compared bacteria from recent outbreaks with hundreds of others samples and [published the results](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0710834105v1) last Monday. The scientists drew an evolutionary tree based on the differences in the bacteria's genes. One branch of the tree\u2014the one that caused the spinach and lettuce outbreaks in 2006\u2014is significantly more likely to make people sick than the others. And they found that this lineage has been exploding in recent years. In 2002, it accounted for 10 percent of the E. coli cases recorded in Michigan. In 2006, it accounted for 46 percent. To figure out what makes this new strain so vicious, the scientists selected a microbe from the 2006 spinach outbreak and sequenced its entire genome. They discovered that it is not a minor variation on the basic E. coli O157:H7 plan. It is a major overhaul. Hundreds of its genes can't be found in other strains. It has lost hundreds of others. And many of the genes it shares with its close relatives have mutated. The scientists concluded that at some point in the not-too-distant past, this strain of E. coli O157:H7 evolved rapidly into a far meaner pathogen than its ancestors. Natural selection altered its genes quickly, thanks to the ability bacteria have to reproduce in as little time as 20 minutes. Speeding up their evolution even further was their ability to take in DNA from other microbes, even from species that are only distantly related. The genomes of bacteria are being continually rejiggered into new combinations of genes. Some bacteria become better at capturing sunlight, others at resisting antibiotics. And, in the case of the spinach strain of E. coli O157:H7, the introduction of viral DNA has made them far nastier. It is chilling to think just how quickly a new, more dangerous form of E. coli has emerged\u2014and it's tempting to think that its quick arrival bodes ill for synthetic biology. After all, if it just takes a few years for a dangerous strain to evolve in the wild, just think how easy it will be for people to build them in the lab. In fact, the spinach outbreak teaches a very different lesson. The Michigan State scientists have no idea what is making the new strain so mean. It's a straightforward task to identify the hundreds of new genes in its genome, but the researchers can't say precisely what all those new genes are doing. The same goes for the hundreds of missing genes as well as for the other genes tweaked and fine-tuned by natural selection. This sort of ignorance is par for the course in the world of microbes. And if a new strain of an intensely studied species is so mysterious, it's hard to believe that bioterrorists could just type out a new plague on their keyboards. Our deep ignorance also raises some doubts about how far synthetic biologists can go with the good applications of the science. In the most ambitious projects, scientists have inserted only a few genes. They've had some spectacular successes, such as making E. coli produce jet fuel and [precursors to malaria medicine](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7086/full/nature04640.html). But the notion that we might add hundreds of genes to bacteria to do something useful, like turn microbes into solar power generators, may be hubris for a long time to come. Inventors don't always design their inventions from scratch, though. Perhaps someone could create a new pathogen simply by mimicking nature: combining different sets of genes, mutating a few of them, and using trial and error to find ones that worked? Probably not. Nature's lab bench is colossal. Millions of cattle and other animals are carrying around E. coli O157:H7, and an incalculable number of viruses are invading them, trying out new combinations. Many of those combinations turn out to be failures, but natural selection can give rise to a few spectacular successes. Even if a government built a giant lab just for the purpose of stumbling across a new pathogen, it might take centuries or millenniums to hit on something like the spinach strain. But this ignorance is not cause for much comfort. Even if we don't need to worry about synthetic bacteria just yet, we do need to worry about new pathogens evolving right in our own backyard (or, rather, our own feedlots and factory farms). As things stand, we become vaguely aware of these bacteria only once they've been sickening and killing for years. One way to speed up the search for nature's new bioweapons would be to set up a monitoring network. If public-health workers were equipped with cheap, fast testing devices, E. coli and other microbes might not be able to surprise us so often in the future. And if some evil genius does someday figure out how to unleash a bioweapon, we will have had an excellent rehearsal. WASHINGTON, D.C.\u2014National bonding is rare in American sports. We break into groups to root for our favorite pro and college teams, and this factional fandom means our games are zero-sum\u2014when my guys win, somebody else's guys lose. But the NCAA Tournament is different. When an underdog gets a late lead, CBS zooms in and we all hope for a Miracle on Hardwood. On Thursday night, the nation (OK, minus a few Duke fans) prayed for the Belmont Bruins. Or, as they'll forever be known, that 15 seed that almost beat Duke. In the Verizon Center, the crowd smells Blue Devil blood. With two minutes to go in Thursday's opening-round game, Belmont's Justin Hare gets fouled and the Bruins have a chance to take the lead. As Hare walks slowly across half-court, flexing his wrist to tune up for the free-throw line, my view from press row is obscured by the Belmont benchwarmers, all standing and flapping their arms up and down to incite the crowd. The team's scrawny student manager looks like a strong candidate for spontaneous human combustion. He pumps his right fist and raises his arms above his head like Rocky, claiming victory with two minutes to go. Hare makes both free throws. Belmont's up 70-69. Fans in Arizona red and West Virginia yellow, finding common cause, writhe together in ecstasy. We are one nation under a \" [Duck Fuke](http://www.truthaboutduke.com/shop_dis.php?photoid=33)\" sign. The crowd has been on tenterhooks for a half hour now. During an earlier TV timeout, the Duke cheerleaders were booed mercilessly for doing nothing more than bouncing happily onto the court to shake their pom-poms. A sign that the crowd is in the Bruins' favor: There are three Belmont cheerleaders in the stands. I walk over and ask why they're not out with their seven female colleagues, and they tell me there's a little-known NCAA rule capping the number of spirit squad members who can be on the court at once. As Belmont takes the lead, the auxiliary cheerers bounce up and down like their on-court sisters but don't have room to do the splits. The clock ticks down. Belmont has the ball up one with 40, 30, 20 seconds to go. With 17 seconds left, Bruins guard Alex Renfroe loses control in the lane and fires a wild shot off the backboard. Duke's Gerald Henderson rebounds and strides the length of the floor; nobody from Belmont steps in his path as he coasts to the basket and drops the ball in the net. Duke by one. Belmont's Hare misses an off-balance leaner, but the Bruins come away with the ball. Timeout. Belmont has the ball under Duke's basket with four ticks on the clock and a chance to win. In a post-game interview, Belmont coach Rick Byrd says he's envisioned calling this play his whole life. Every kid who grew up playing basketball has imagined taking, and making, this shot. Four seconds to beat Duke, four seconds for the greatest upset in NCAA Tournament history. In these backyard fairy tales, everything happens like it happened for [Bryce Drew and Valparaiso](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Impx-uPmoEA), not how it happened for Belmont's Renfroe. Belmont called for Triangle, a play in which Renfroe lobs the ball to the front of the rim, where the team's best leaper, Shane Dansby, would be waiting for a dunk or tap-in. But Dansby got bumped as he rolled to the basket, screwing up the timing and leaving Renfroe's pass to float aimlessly. The ball eventually landed in the hands of Duke's DeMarcus Nelson. Then a foul, a missed free throw, a Belmont half-court heave off the left side of the rim. Ballgame. After the game, Renfroe takes the blame, casting himself as [Chris Webber](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH1ujxNwrkA) in reverse. \"It was supposed to be a lob, but it was a bad read by me and a bad pass. I should have called a timeout,\" he says. \"I wasn't thinking.\" It wasn't Renfroe's fault. First, he was Belmont's best player all night, scoring a team-high 15 points and constantly cutting up Duke's lead-footed perimeter defenders with drives to the basket. Second, Triangle probably wasn't the right play; Belmont hadn't run any lobs all game long but did have five players on the floor capable of hitting a spot-up jumper. On the podium at the post-game press conference, Byrd absolves Renfroe of any fault. (\"Thanks, coach,\" Renfroe says. The coach's jokey rejoinder: \"We'll talk about your defense later.\") It was a dumb play-call, Byrd says, and besides, Belmont had a bunch of other missed opportunities. Justin Hare, for one, missed a shot that would've put the Bruins up by three with just over a minute to go. \"If we'd scored earlier, if I had run a better out-of-bounds play, if Justin's shot had gone in,\" Byrd lamented, \"we probably wouldn't have played any better, but we'd be still celebrating out there and the world would be talking about us.\" After the NCAA's official interview session, I walk with Byrd in the hallway to the locker room to get in a few more questions. The [long-time Belmont coach](http://belmontbruins.com/athletics/mensbasketball/0708players/mbbcoach0708.html), a folksy 54-year-old in a maroon sweater-vest, confesses that he heard the roar of the crowd but says he never got nervous. \"There are a lot of games I don't have any fun coaching,\" he says. He talks about the pressures that Duke must face, how they're expected to win every game, before making his way back to his own experience: \"It was the most fun game I ever coached in.\" As his wife and daughter stand and wait, and a woman walks past to tell the coach the team bus is about to pull away, Byrd keeps talking. When Justin Hare shot the ball in the lane with a minute to go, Byrd says, he's not sure the Duke defender was in \"legal position\"\u2014not that he's saying there should've been a foul called. He continues, saying he told Mike Krzyzewski how he's trying to turn Belmont into \"a mini-version of Duke.\" I get the feeling that I'm hearing the first run-through of a story that Rick Byrd will be telling for the rest of his life. Belmont's one-point loss is just 10 minutes old, and it already sounds like he's on his front porch, 20 years later, talking about the one that got away. As the coach spins his yarn, guard Andy Wicke, who made a late three-pointer to get the Bruins within one, walks past in his warm-ups and tells his coach his plans for the evening: \"Yes sir, I'm going to go with my parents.\" Then comes Alex Renfroe, walking with his head down and a plastic-covered dinner plate in his hand. He gets a consoling hug from the coach's wife and continues down the hall. He's in more of a hurry than Byrd is to leave the building, to get on the team bus. In the background, you can hear the roar from the West Virginia-Arizona game. The winner will play Duke, but it coulda, woulda, shoulda been Belmont. As every college hoops fan knows, the one shining moment of the NCAA Tournament isn't when your favorite team wins. It's when Duke loses. Or perhaps you get your jollies from rooting against some team besides Duke. Well, probably not. But just in case, here's Sports Nut's [annual](http://www.slate.com/id/2114937/) [roundup](http://www.slate.com/id/2161810/) of the evil, repugnant, detestable teams that make March Madness such a joy Duke University, Atlantic Coast Conference, No. 2 in West Region If history is our guide, 64 teams in the 2008 NCAA Tournament believe the fans, critics, and concessionaires aren't giving them enough respect. There's one team, though, that thinks the exact opposite. In recent years, coach Mike Krzyzewski, have confessed to reporters the terrible burden that the Blue Devils must bear: Duke always gets the other team's best shot. Complaining that you get too much respect, that the NCAA's junior associates have the gall to try to beat you, is the quintessence of Duke basketball. I believe psychologists refer to this as [narcissistic personality disorder](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/narcissistic-personality-disorder/DS00652). Sure, every team and every hoops fan wants to see [Coach Leadership and Ethics](http://cole.fuqua.duke.edu/) bite it. But that's not because Duke is on top of the basketball world\u2014George Mason has reached as many Final Fours over the last six years. No, America's hatred of Duke grows ever-stronger because the program derives so much of its [ample self-regard](http://www.newsweek.com/id/123333/output/print) from being hated. It's a vicious cycle of J.J. Redick [says then-pre-frosh Greg Paulus](http://hoopshype.com/interviews/redick_sierra.htm) will be \"hated as much as me,\" an arrogant prediction that makes both Redick and Paulus instantly more loathsome. The most frustrating thing about hating Duke, then, is knowing the program would wither and die if you could just stop paying attention. After all, Duke doesn't play on national television 800 times a year because people want to see Greg Paulus win.\u2014Josh Levin Baylor University, Big 12 Conference, No. 11 in West Region Hate is not a word I would use to describe Baylor, the red-brick university conveniently located mere yards from Interstate 35 in Waco, Texas. As any Big 12 alum will tell you, playing the Bears, who hadn't made the NCAA Tournament in 20 years, inspires a different emotion: fear. Fear of losing to a massively inferior opponent, fear of bowing before the runt of the conference. This season, after Texas A&M dropped [a five-overtime game](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280230245) to the Bears, the Aggies were serenaded with chants of \"worse than Bay-lor!\" by opposing fans. The joke was that such a fate was unimaginable. The Bears' list of vanquished opponents is impressive: Notre Dame, Winthrop, Kansas State, A&M, and, nearly, Washington State. They have a lively squad coached by Scott Drew and powered by guard Curtis Jerrells, who scored 36 points in the A&M game. The rise of the Bears threatens to upset the delicate fabric of Texas sports. Can a 14,000-student Baptist school that until recently \"discouraged\" dancing on campus really be in the, um, Big Dance? Can Baylor's success wipe away the memories of the sordid [murder scandal](http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/2005-06-08-dotson-plea_x.htm) of 2003? Will all of us Texans have to look at one another and say, \"We are worse than Baylor?\" The mind reels.\u2014Bryan Curtis University of Wisconsin, Big Ten Conference, No. 3 in Midwest Region Everyone bags on Big Ten football, and appropriately so, but the Midwestern brand of pigskin is easy on the eyes compared with Big Ten hoops: a raft of mediocre teams, plenty of flow-restricting physicality, and, all-too-often, Brent Musberger, looking live from Champaign or Iowa City. The most painful Big Ten team to endure is the Badgers, a team that combines brutishness and blandness into an unwatchable goulash. I blame Bo Ryan, the coach who has created a top program in Madison by installing all manner of defensive tactics while forgetting the game is supposed to be entertainment. To use a soccer analogy, the Badgers always appear to be playing for a draw but manage to get enough muscled-in offensive rebounds from the likes of Brian Butch to get past the league's weak competition. Wisconsin will muck along in the tournament until it runs into a team that knows how to execute a crossover dribble. Until then, I'll be singing my own version of [the Badgers' fight song](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On,_Wisconsin!) every time they clog up my TV: \"Off, Wisconsin!\"\u2014Robert Weintraub Cornell University, Ivy League, No. 14 in South Region I wasn't sure I hated Cornell at first. The team broke Penn and Princeton's 19-year stranglehold on the NCAA Tournament. That's refreshing. Upon closer examination, however, several hate-stoking facts came to light: Western Kentucky University, Sun Belt Conference, No. 12 in West Region Cornell isn't the only Big Red in this year's tournament. That's also the name of [the most soulless mascot in all of sports](http://www.wku.edu/bigred.html), a sort of [backwoods cousin to Grimace](http://mollysunshine.org/photos/WKU_Basketball_Game_012_Sized.jpg) who devours children on behalf of the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers. [Others](http://espn-att.starwave.com/media/ncf/2005/0919/photo/i_stanfordtree_195.jpg) are perhaps uglier; [some](http://www.netitor.com/photos/schools/ill/sports/m-footbl/auto_original/460217.jpeg) are racially gauche. But Big Red? Not to all [Thorstein Veblen](http://de.geocities.com/veblenite/) here, but Big Red\u2014the \"All-American mascot,\" as the school would have it\u2014is nothing but a great big goggle-eyed tribute to consumerism. Consider: Big Red was born in 1979, the brainchild of one Ralph Carey, a public-relations student at Western Kentucky and future ad executive who, according to one [account](http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/03/06/loc_kybigred060.html), fashioned his mascot after various Hanna-Barbera characters. (Hanna-Barbera, it bears noting, was a low-rent, corner-cutting cartoon production company that never drew a tree it didn't repurpose.) The result was the sort of anodyne red blob that might've been fished out of a Sesame Street dumpster and run through three focus groups. So bereft is Big Red of any defining characteristic that an Italian media company, owned by Silvio Berlusconi, could steal it wholesale, essentially admit as much, and still [beat back](http://media.www.wkuherald.com/media/storage/paper603/news/2007/12/06/BreakingNews/Western.Loses.In.Copyright.Trademark.Infringement.Case-3146106.shtml) the copyright suit. Big Red is now a tireless shill. He is a fixture on ESPN commercials and makes about 225 public appearances a year. Cough up $50 an hour, and he'll devour your children on their birthdays. Carey once said that the mascot represented \"the spirit, the energy of a sporting event.\" Well, that and Nike, whose shoes Big Red has worn faithfully since 1979. All-American, indeed.\u2014Tommy Craggs University of Texas, Big 12 Conference, No. 2 in South Region \"We're scheduled to come play Arkansas next year, and if the fans don't treat us well, we're not going to come,\" Texas coach Rick Barnes [proclaimed](http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/longhorns/entries/2008/03/17/barnes_to_arkan.html) to the local media as his team prepared to play its first-round NCAA Tournament game in North Little Rock, Ark. \"We've got enough money here we can buy our way out of it. So, they'd better be good to us.\" This weekend, I'm counting on my fellow Arkansas fans to tell Barnes where he can stick his gigantic sack of money. How nice of the Texas coach to remind civilization, and a new generation of Hog supporters, how good it feels to hate on the 'Horns. It felt good to stomp No. 1 Texas 42-11 in Fayetteville in 1981, it felt good to ditch the old Southwest Conference for the SEC (\"Let Texas play with themselves,\" it was said at the time), and it felt good to eat a publicly roasted steer before each year's Texas game. Of course, that fanfare applied only to football, which in Texas (and Arkansas) remains king. The fact that Barnes is brandishing the cash earned by the Texas football team is downright adorable. Unlike his basketball program, the Longhorns' football program, at least, has managed to buy itself a title.\u2014Sam Eifling West Virginia University, Big East Conference, No. 7 in West Region Some great collegiate cheers give even nonpartisans goosebumps. Mountaineers!\" is not one of them. Especially when it comes from a visiting crowd of ill-tempered, well-liquored Larry the Cable Guy aficionados. Some background: On Feb. 12, 2006, West Virginia rolled into D.C.'s Verizon Center. My Hoyas had beaten Duke. They'd beaten Notre Dame. They'd beaten Pitt. And then they got Pittsnogled. The [most annoying 6-foot-11 player](http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=63870222) in Big East history scored 15 in the second half, and victory in hand, the cheer rolled sickeningly through the arena. At least under coach John Beilein, you had to admire the Mountaineers' scrappy personnel and his embrace of the same 1-3-1 zone I ran in 6th-grade CYO ball. But now that the 'Eers have hired Bob Huggins, [slime bucket of slime buckets](http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/9055727/), they're about two classes of juco recruits away from obliterating any lingering shreds of self-respect. As for Kevin Pittsnogle, I've made my peace. As a lesser-known cheer goes: That's all right, that's OK, we'll get [your wedding pictures](http://www.bevosports.com/2006/03/23/kevin-pittsnogle-is-a-snazzy-dresser/) someday.\u2014Mike DeBonis University of Arizona, Pacific-10 Conference, No. 10 in West Region Arizona will play in its 24th straight NCAA tournament this week, the longest active streak. That's one too many. In the last three weeks, the Wildcats are winless against everyone but Oregon State, a [historically awful](http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaab/news?slug=uwire-beaversbecomefirstteaminhi&prov=uwire&type=lgns&print=1) bunch of losers that hasn't put up a fight since challenging the Washington Huskies to a [duel in a hotel parking lot](http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaab/blog/ncaab_experts/post/Oregon-State-0-13-in-the-Pac-10-undefeated-in-?urn=ncaab,67821). But nothing about the anemic Wildcats, not even the team's [(non)graduation rate](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=graduation/080317), reeks as much as the behavior of Lute Olson, Arizona's longtime coach. Olson bailed on the team for \"personal\" reasons right before the season, then had the gall to haunt the program all year like an [overzealous ombudsman](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/seth_davis/03/04/arizona/index.html). When he later invented new \"personal\" reasons, even [devoted locals](http://media.wildcat.arizona.edu/media/storage/paper997/news/2008/03/12/News/Lutes.Absence.Lacks.Class-3264972.shtml?refsource=collegeheadlines) had to wonder why state taxpayers were footing the bill for the absent coach's $750,000 salary. If that weren't enough, the Silver Fox erased this bizarre story's only silver lining by announcing last week that he's [returning to coach](http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gI0LqW7J4_fcJ0WHwoAH-xCA-HJgD8VAUIGO0) next season. I'm guessing that beleaguered interim coach Kevin O'Neill made like Jack Nicholson in About Schmidt, when he rolls over in bed, glares at his wife, and asks, \"Who is this old woman living in my house?\" She dies shortly thereafter. Let's hope Arizona exits just as gracefully this weekend.\u2014Chris Park University of Georgia, Southeastern Conference, No. 14 in West Region It's tough enough to deal with UGA's obnoxious, thin-skinned fans during football season. Now, thanks to a [miracle run to the SEC Tournament title](http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=sportsnetwork&page=cbask/news/AEN4138875.htm), the Athens contingent has something else to crow endlessly about. Because [a tornado](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/champweek2008/news/story?id=3295046) rendered downtown Atlanta unfit for frivolity, the Dawgs did the deed in the home gym of its arch-enemy, Georgia Tech. Suffice it to say, Hotlanta will never hear the end of it. Georgia fans are so self-righteous, they probably believe the twister (which I heard but didn't see, if you're curious) was sent by the Lord hisself to facilitate the unlikely championship. I prefer to blame Tennessee and Vanderbilt, the conference's two best teams, for gazing toward the bigger tournament that starts this week, thus helping a team that won four conference games all season win four in three days and the SEC's automatic tourney bid. I'd have liked the Bulldogs' chances if the NCAAs had started Monday. Georgia is like the kid who gets on an ungodly hot streak and makes 30 straight free throws before mom makes him come home. When he heads back out after dinner, the magic is gone, and it's brick after brick after brick. By Thursday afternoon, when the Bulldogs take on Xavier, reality will have set in. That'll shut up those Georgia fans\u2014at least until next month's [spring football game](http://www.georgiadogs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=40673&SPID=3571&DB_OEM_ID=8800&ATCLID=1409841).\u2014Robert Weintraub American University, Patriot League, No. 15 in East Region At opposite ends of the 20th century, bookending those happy days when the school acted as a [supposed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Camelot) front for the CIA, American University found itself thoroughly beset by noxious gasbags. I refer, in the first instance, to the containers of Lewisite and mustard gas buried at the fringe of campus after World War I. On the tail end, I refer, of course, to John Feinstein. There are many fine reasons to root for American, out of the Patriot League, not least because this will be the program's first appearance in the NCAA Tournament. But I can't, in good conscience, cheer for any team that inspires Feinstein, America's Favorite Sportswriter, to inflict his prose on the reading public, especially the sort found in [The Last Amateurs](http://www.amazon.com/Last-Amateurs-Playing-Division-Basketball/dp/0316278424), Feinstein's 5,897th book. The book is nominally an account of the Patriot League's 1999-2000 basketball season; the real subject, however, is Feinstein himself, who is sad that he can longer watch major college basketball\u2014with its \"win-at-all costs mentality\" and \"pampered players\"\u2014and pretend he's 8 years old. Now, it is not American's fault that Feinstein fashioned the school and its fellow conference members into some ridiculous last redoubt of athletic purity, full of intelligent young men playing for \"glory and honor\" (as opposed to the kids in Conference USA, who, as we all know, play for hookers and cocaine). But the die has been cast. American University: Basketball that's good for you. Cheering for the Eagles now is like cheering for Brussels sprouts and condoms.\u2014Tommy Craggs University of Southern California, Pacific-10 Conference, No. 6 in Midwest Region There was a time when I hated Tim Floyd for mere incompetence\u2014when Chicago Bulls GM Jerry Krause plucked him from Ames, Iowa, to [rebuild a soon-to-be Jordan-and-Pippenless franchise](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE0DC1339F937A15754C0A96E958260). After compiling a 90-231 NBA record, Floyd returned to college, where his loathsomeness sprouts from seamier endeavors. While USC's mysterious acquisition of prep star O.J. Mayo generated some under-the-breath muttering, I'm willing to believe Floyd's not-really-believable story: that Mayo essentially turned up on his doorstep, [having recruited himself](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0Pcjt7oJqc). But forget about O.J. Mayo\u2014there's a much more important recruiting scandal going on at USC. The Trojans have spent one of next year's scholarships on Romeo Miller, a mediocre 5-foot-10 point guard better known as wee rapper Lil' Romeo. \"The more buzz you can create, the more news stories you can create, the better served you are as a program,\" Floyd [told the Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB120485166974418241-lMyQjAxMDI4MDA0NzgwNTcxWj.html), explaining why he recruited Master P's hoops-impaired kid. USC and Tim Floyd must be stopped now, before they destroy college basketball for good. Your 2012 NCAA title game: Jonathan Lipnicki and USC vs. Stanford's superstar guard Miley Cyrus.\u2014Mike DeBonis Question: How do you know when the contest is not officially \"over,\" but the outcome is no longer in doubt? Answer: How would I know? I was a Huckabee guy. With apologies to the [Sage of St. Louis](http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/1303), there comes a time when it ain't over, but ... it's over. There comes a time in a relationship when a woman will still answer your phone calls, but you're wasting your money buying flowers; you know what I'm saying? There comes a moment during a job interview when you're still talking, but you might as well take off your shoes. There is a time in an illness when you're not dead yet, but you might as well stop taking that nasty medicine. There is a line there somewhere, and how do you know when the line is crossed that separates hope from fantasy? If we're talking politics, romance, job interviews, or medicine, I don't know. When it comes to college basketball, I've got a theory. This thing has a 40-year history, actually. I've been attending basketball games at [Allen Field House](http://kuathletics.cstv.com/facilities/kan-allen-fieldhouse.html) in Lawrence, Kan. (home of the [Jayhawks](http://kuathletics.cstv.com/)), since 1967. The Jayhawks usually win by 15 or 20 points, and sometime in about 1968 I started wondering whether there wasn't some way to decide when the game was no longer in doubt. I began to experiment with heuristic inventions to try to find the moment at which the line was crossed. A heuristic could be loosely defined as a mathematical rule that works even though no licensed mathematician would be caught dead associating with it. [Let's ]()see ... what about: The game is over when the number of points you are ahead (or behind) is more than one-tenth the number of seconds left in the game? [*](#Correction) Nah, that doesn't work. If you're 30 points behind, the game is over much more than five minutes out (300 seconds); if you're two points behind, the game is not over when there are 20 seconds left. The rule doesn't work on either end. Eventually I found a rule that did work at that time, but at that time there was no 3-point shot in basketball. When they added the 3-point line, I had to recalibrate my system. OK, I've stalled as long as I can. You ready? (If you don't have a calculator handy, use the tool below to do the calculations for you.) If you've got a 10-point lead and the ball with 10 minutes left, is that a safe lead? Of course not; teams come back from a 10-point deficit all the time. A 10-point lead, plus the ball, gives you a 7.5-point safety margin. It's safe for 56.25 seconds\u201456, rounded down. With 600 seconds to play, a 10-point lead (with the ball) is 9 percent safe. That doesn't mean a team with a 10-point lead and the ball with 10 minutes to go has only a 9 percent chance of winning. Rather, it means they're 9 percent of the way to having a completely insurmountable advantage. An 11-point lead with nine minutes to play\u2014we'll let you keep the ball. That's an 8.5-point safety margin with 540 seconds to play; it's 13 percent safe (72.25 divided by 540). A 12-point lead with eight minutes to play ... that's a 9.5 point margin. It's 19 percent safe (90.25 divided by 480). A 13-point lead with seven minutes to play ... 26 percent safe. A 16-point lead with four minutes to play ... 76 percent safe, assuming the team with the lead also has the ball. It's really unusual for a team to come from 16 back with four to play and win, but it does happen. I would guess it happens twice a year somewhere in the world of college basketball. A 17-point lead with three minutes to play ... bingo. That's a safe lead. Seventeen points with three minutes to play is a safe lead whether you have the ball or not, actually; a 17-point lead with the ball is safe at 3:30; a 17-point lead without the ball is safe at 3:02. Once a lead is safe, it's permanently safe, even if the score tightens up. You're down 17 with three to play; you can make a little run, maybe cut it to 8 with 1:41 to play. The lead, if it was once safe, remains safe. The theory of a safe lead is that to overcome it requires a series of events so improbable as to be essentially impossible. If the \"dead\" team pulls back over the safety line, that just means that they got some part of the impossible sequence\u2014not that they have a meaningful chance to run the whole thing. Why calculate when the lead is safe? The real answer is \"because I like to.\" I like to feel that I understand little things about sports. I like to feel that I can see the difference between a safe lead and a live contest for the same reason that I like to feel that I can recognize a zone defense and recognize a pick-and-roll. But if that answer doesn't work for you ... you pay a price in sports for anything you believe that is not true. The fact is that everybody around a college basketball game\u2014the coaches, the announcers, even the referees at a lower level\u2014calculates when the game is really over. They calculate it with intuition and guesswork. When the lead is judged to be safe, the coaches empty the bench. When the lead is judged to be safe, the announcers start re-ranking the top 25 and talking about the upcoming games or the next-round matchups. When the lead is safe, the Jayhawk fans start doing the slow, spooky [Rock Chalk chant](http://www.rockchalk.com/john/john/rock.html). I love that. If a coach misjudges the moment at which the lead is safe, he can empty the bench too early and get himself into trouble. I've never actually seen a coach lose a game that way, but I certainly have seen coaches misjudge when the lead is safe, empty the bench too early, and get hit by a haymaker. More commonly, because coaches are afraid that that might happen, they continue to compete after the game is beyond any reasonable possibility of a reversal. That has consequences, too. You can get a player hurt playing for nothing. You can miss the opportunity to get a little bit of rest for players who are tired at the end of the season but have a game on Saturday. You can miss the opportunity to get that 12th man his 20 seconds in an NCAA tournament game\u2014and if there's no value in that, then why do they do it? And I think we've all seen games in which the announcers misjudged the moment when the lead was safe and started talking about the consequences of an outcome that was never to be. Probably announcers don't enjoy doing that. I have never personally seen a game in which a team lost after having a safe lead. In February 1994, LSU led Kentucky by 31 with 15:30 left to play, only to see [Kentucky rally for a 99-95 victory](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E5D61F38F935A25751C0A962958260). That was impressive, but a 31-point lead without the ball is safe for 12:36. The lead was 81 percent safe. And then this year, [LSU blew a 15-point lead to Villanova](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=273400222) with 2:59 to go\u2014which, again, is close but no kewpie doll. With 179 seconds to play you need a 13.5-point margin, which means a 16-point lead with the ball or 17 without. The curse of Dale Brown. Actually, I would guess Dale was cursing up a storm when that happened. My editor, doing his due diligence, found one game in which a team lost after holding a safe lead. On March 2, 1974, North Carolina trailed Duke, 86-78, with 17 seconds to play\u2014a safe lead for Duke. Duke had repeated misadventures in in-bounding the basketball and [wound up losing the game in overtime](http://tarheelblue.cstv.com/genrel/030402aaa.html). That was before [the human typo](http://www.coachk.com/) was hired to coach Duke, but ... does anybody know where I could get a tape of that game? My little formula, over the course of 40 years, has wormed its way into our family's college basketball experience. Early on in every game, usually once in the first half when the score is about 23-21 and again midway through the second half, I will observe soberly, in my best faux-expert voice, that \"the lead is not safe,\" and my wife will look at me not only as if I were an idiot, but as if for some reason she is surprised by this. In the closing minutes of a tense game, it gets serious: \"Is that it? Is the lead safe yet, Dad? How much more?\" They are waiting to exhale, waiting to unbundle their nerves. They know that every time the clock stops, when I should be scoping out the cheerleaders, I am recalculating the lead in the back of my head. I've been doing it so long, I can do both at the same time. I hope you get something out of it. And if you do, tell Ralph Nader. It's over, man. Go home. [Correction](), March 17, 2008: This piece originally misstated a possible heuristic for determining whether a basketball lead is safe. Rather than \"[t]he game is over when the number of points you are ahead (or behind) is more than 10 times the number of seconds left in the game,\" it should have read \"more than one-tenth the numbers of seconds.\" ( [Return](#Return) to the corrected sentence.) With all due respect to those who complain that the justices on the Supreme Court are too secretive, and for those who wish, perhaps, that David Souter was more like David \" [West Side Days Inn](http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2008/03/paterson-i-was-involved-with-s.html)\" Paterson, oral argument today in [District of Columbia v. Heller](http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-290.pdf) offers up a bounty of alarming personal revelations. The least of which is that judges are completely political. But who knew that a case testing the scope of the Second Amendment's \"right to bear arms\" would smoke out a secret side of Justice Anthony Kennedy? A side so intensely protective of his right to self-defense that he makes\u2014as I count\u2014four separate references to some mythical \"remote settler\" who\u2014at the time of the framing of the Constitution\u2014would have needed a gun to \"defend himself and his family against hostile Indian tribes and outlaws, wolves and bears, and grizzlies.\" Who could have known that growing up in the wilds of Sacramento, Calif., fostered in Kennedy such romantic nostalgia for the good old days of grizzly hunting? Kennedy is of course the court's consummate romantic, but there is little romance to be found in parsing Ye Olde Constitution. That is what today is about, however. That and the abandonment of every principle of strict construction, federalism, and judicial modesty in which the Roberts Court ever purported to believe. Give or take some commas, the Second Amendment provides that: \"a well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" The constitutional question is whether that first clause limits the right to bear arms to a citizen militia, or whether the militia language represents a bit of constitutional phlegm standing between you and your full-throated right to bear arms. The courts have tended to go for the former approach, but, then, they have also neglected this whole issue for decades. Last year, the court of appeals for the District of Columbia used the individual-rights rationale to strike down D.C.'s gun law\u2014which all but bans handguns and requires permitted firearms to be stored unloaded and trigger-locked. There is a second question the court must face\u2014about which standard it might use to evaluate gun laws\u2014but that is a pragmatic question that might get in the way of all this romantic close-reading of 18th-century text, so the justices largely avoid it. Arguing in favor of the District of Columbia today is former acting solicitor general (and Slate contributor) Walter Dellinger, and when he gets personal, it's to tell the justices where he goes to buy a trigger lock (17th Street Hardware) and how long it takes him to remove it\u2014say, in the event of an attack by a grizzly bear (three seconds). Dellinger opens by whooshing us back in time to the framers, who, he says, used the words \"bear arms\" to mean \"rendering a military service.\" Chief Justice John Roberts immediately asks why the framers wrote \"the right of the people\" if they merely meant \"the right of the militia.\" Justice Kennedy spoils any suspense by telling Dellinger, in the form of a question, that he has no problem \"de-linking\" the two clauses to read the first as \"reaffirming\" the right to a militia and the second as enshrining a right to bear arms. Justice Antonin Scalia does Kennedy one better and contends that the two phrases \"go together beautifully.\" That's five votes to create a fundamental right to bear arms, only eight minutes into the argument. Dellinger warns that for the court to view the Second Amendment as conferring \"a fundamental liberty interest\"\u2014unmoored from the militia rationale\u2014risks undermining state and local government regulations on guns. When Kennedy goes even further back in time to the English bill of rights in 1689, Scalia starts fretting about the Scottish highlanders and Roman Catholics, for whom he worries in the manner of Kennedy and the grizzly bears. Dellinger attempts to shift from arguing about the romantic nature of the right to bear arms to the reasonableness of the D.C. gun regulations, but the chief justice is quick to cut him off: \"What is reasonable about a total ban on possession?\" Dellinger replies that the handgun ban is only on \"one kind of weapon that's considered especially dangerous,\" to which Roberts retorts, \"So if you have a law that prohibits the possession of books, it's all right to ban newspapers?\" Dellinger replies that the rifles and shotguns permitted under the D.C. ban are sufficient to carry out the purposes of the gun owner. He adds that the rationale used by the D.C. appeals court would make it harder for \"machine guns or armor-piercing bullets\" to be regulated. Scalia disagrees emphatically. He says the D.C. court defined arms to include \"the kind of weapon that was common for the people to have. I don't know that a lot of people have machine guns or armor-piercing bullets.\" Dellinger contends that handguns can be more dangerous than other guns. They can be \"taken into schools, into buses, into government office buildings.\" Samuel Alito and Dellinger then tussle over whether there is a self-defense exception to the D.C. law, and, as has happened rather frequently on Roberts' watch, Dellinger is given extra time to finish his argument. Dellinger asks the court to avoid turning every phrase of the Second Amendment into a \"libertarian right.\" A well-regulated militia isn't about everyone owning a gun willy-nilly. The Constitution does not create some kind of sacred, fundamental right to guns. If there's a right here at all, he says, it's at the \"penumbra of the periphery\" of the Constitution: in a shack behind the river where the other unenumerated rights huddle. Paul Clement has 15 minutes to represent [the part of the Bush administration that isn't insane](http://www.slate.com/id/2185927/), and he is saved from career-wrecking ideological moderation by the justices' obsessive focus on the part of his case in which he agrees with gun owners. Like them, he argues for an \"individual right\" that has no relation to service in the militia. After justices David Souter, John Paul Stevens, and Ruth Bader Ginsberg preclude him from talking for a very long time, he is forced to assure them that if they would just let him finish a sentence, he'd get to the part of his argument where he agrees with them. When Clement is finally permitted to explain why he rejects \"strict scrutiny\"\u2014the most exacting standard for evaluating a law\u2014Roberts indicates that he, for one, has no interest in articulating an intricate constitutional standard\u2014be it strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, or otherwise. He pooh-poohs the various tests floated in the amicus briefs for evaluating gun laws. Roberts describes the \"compelling interest,\" \"significant interest,\" and \"narrowly tailored\" tests that have subsidized orthodontia for the children of many law professors over the years as First Amendment \"baggage.\" Clement finds himself in the strange position of telling the court that if they protect gun rights as they are poised to do, they may have to strike down the federal machine-gun ban. Scalia can't seem to figure out what he's so worried about. Alan Gura represents D.C. gun owners, and a lot of folks had doubts about him, given that today was his first appearance at the high court. I see no evidence of wobbliness beyond the fact that just 12 seconds into his presentation, Scalia barks, \"Talk a little slower; I'm not following you.\" [Breyer](), turning from the poetry of constitutional language to the reality of the D.C. gun ban, cites the 80,000-100,000 people \"killed or wounded\" as a result of guns in America each year, asking why the ban on handguns isn't a reasonable regulation. [*](#Correction) Gura says the military claims that citizens who have gun training are better soldiers. Breyer asks whether that fact makes it unreasonable for a city with a high crime rate to ban handguns. Scalia tells Gura: \"You want to say yes.\" Gura says yes. Ginsburg asks whether \"the people,\" at the time the Second Amendment was drafted, meant \"males between the ages of 17 and 45,\" and Kennedy invokes, for the third time today, his settler-in-the-wilderness rationale for the Second Amendment. Gura concedes that the government can certainly ban machine guns or plastic handguns intended to get through a metal detector and leaves open the question of whether state universities can ban guns in dorm rooms, thus ensuring that he's off Dick Cheney's Christmas card list forever. Roberts reveals an 11th-hour fondness for trigger locks, out of fear that \"the children will get up and grab the firearm and use it for some purpose\" beyond fighting off government tyranny. Or bears. This leads Justice Breyer to get off his best shot of the day, when he asks whether Gura really wants \"thousands of judges all over the United States,\" as opposed to legislatures, deciding fact-based trigger-lock questions. Responding, Gura intones\u2014in the spirit of Roe v. Wade\u2014that \"when a fundamental right is at stake, there is a role for judicial review.\" Souter asks whether the court might look to \"current crime statistics\" to decide the case. And Scalia says that doing so would be \"all the more reason to allow a homeowner to have a handgun.\" Someone hisses. And when Gura says that the court should be taking normative questions out of the hands of legislature, the transition to Upside-Down World is complete. This question is too complicated for anything but the policy judgments of the court? It's as if he's channeling the whole Warren Court at once. Dellinger offers up a rebuttal that's all triple Lutzes and camel spins. (There are really only a handful of people who can get away with telling justices, \"It took me three seconds [to remove a trigger lock]. I'm not kidding!\") Dellinger refocuses the court on its alleged priorities by reminding them that this is a case about \"local legislation.\" He reminds Kennedy that he of all people would hate a \"national government that sets a single standard for rural and urban areas, for East and West, North and South,\" and that the right to own guns causes \"disputes among experts\" such that the courts should hang back and allow the local legislatures to thrash it out. I sometimes fall for the old line that there's no such thing as politics at the high court; there are merely different interpretational tools. [Not today](http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/convictions/archive/2008/03/18/heller-s-opportunity-to-put-law-over-politics.aspx). Today we have four liberals rediscovering the beauty of local government and judicial restraint and five conservatives poised to identify a fundamental personal right that will have judges mucking about in gun cases for years to come. After all these years of deep conservative suspicion of turning over policy matters to the courts, the Roberts Court has fallen in love with a new constitutional right. And while they don't seem much concerned about how the judges will manage it, they've just about ensured that judges around the country will soon be ruling in gun cases the way they used to rule on speeding tickets. [Correction](), March 19, 2008: The original piece referred to 80,000 to 100,000 gun deaths each year in America. ( [Return](#Return) to the corrected sentence.) First came Next, the MTV dating show most notable for the great care participants take in crafting casually cruel brushoff lines. Then followed Parental Control, the MTV dating show on which adults set up their children on rendezvous with prospective new paramours and trade insults with their current ones. And then MTV Exposed spurted onto the air, a lively little number featuring daters secretly monitored by lie detectors. Taking cues from each of these uplifting programs\u2014and also from Fantasy Island, Brian De Palma films, and police stakeouts\u2014The X Effect marks a logical step downward. This one combines a dating show and a divorce complaint. We're watching people watch their romantic partners rekindle things with old flames. Consider the case of Flavia and Ryan. They used to go out. Now Flavia is seeing Patrick, and Ryan has pledged parts of body and soul to Steff. Some pretense\u2014a pretense both unstated and, the show being blatantly half-phony, doubtlessly thinner than Flavia's blouse\u2014brings each couple to a resort hotel in Miami. Patrick and Steff are soon herded into an SUV, and Flavia and Ryan\u2014the exes, referred to here as \"the X's\"\u2014are instructed that they'll be spending the weekend together. They see their current lovers ferried away. The vehicle drives around the block, and the producers install Patrick and Steff\u2014\"the O's,\" as if love were a battlefield, and they were on defense\u2014in a bungalow offering the comforts of an unmarked surveillance truck, plus continental breakfast and, for down-time amusement, a Jenga set. A person named Natalia functions as a hostess, a concierge, a dungeon mistress. She hands Patrick and Steff a guide that explains the spy game they've been drafted into. The O's always read this aloud\u2014a welcome contribution to atmosphere and also handy proof that they are literate. Technology introduced at the outset of each episode includes a \"touch sensor\" (a vaguely tiki-inspired lamp that glows red whenever the skin of the X's meets as they exchange friendly hugs or desperate embraces or 100-proof body shots) and a \"transaction log\" (which tracks the purchase of Long Island iced teas). The weekend unfolds at precisely the same pace in each episode. The form is rigid. The rules governing the composition of a villanelle are comparatively lax. After the O's have fretted about the red light for a little while, Natalia troops back in\u2014only the faintest hint of sadism in her service-industry smile at this point\u2014to tell them that they must send the X's on an activity. The choice is always between some pastime so wholesome as to constitute a weak punch line (croquet, chess, badminton) and something explicitly skanky (the \"sexy swimsuit photo shoot,\" the chocolate spa). Of course, only the salacious option offers the chance for further eavesdropping. Of course, the O's always indulge the opportunity. Similarly, they never decline Natalia's offer to send their lovers further treats, such as a make-your-own-s'mores kit with a listening device in the mini-grill. Matters escalate. The X's fall\u2014but, more frequently, leap\u2014into old habits. The O's grow tormented, with the boys tending to adopt slouching postures in their misery\u2014deep, disconsolate slumps, spines parallel to the floor\u2014and the girls preferring to curl up into the most adorable little fetal balls. The O's make statements to the camera: \"I thought they were gonna have a good weekend together as friends, but the licking was uncalled-for.\" In due course, the X's receive a complimentary upgrade to a sprawling suite\u2014Villa de los Amantes, it is called\u2014and the O's learn about a new feature of their in-room entertainment. Natalia shows them how to access a TV channel displaying the layout of Villa de los Amantes, with a pink X and blue X onscreen to represent their significant others and their positions in the room. \"Or,\" she adds, taunting now, \"you can turn off the TV if you don't want to watch.\" With numbing predictability, the pink X and blue X make straight for the shower. The touch sensor goes twirling across the room. The Jenga tower tumbles with a clatter. Episodes end with confrontations, ultimata, decisions. The sound editors do sterling work with face-slapping, not only enhancing the noise of aggrieved palm on stubbly cheek but also introducing the whoosh of the wind-up. The show otherwise has a flat affect. It's as jaded as a private detective. It's not here to shock you. Shows like The X Effect don't lead the culture; they follow it, discovering, in this case, a new mutation of the soap opera and its themes\u2014 jealousy, betrayal, trust, lust, Jacuzzis. You can turn off the TV if you don't want to watch. We still think of the archetypal unwed mother as a Jamie Lynn Spears\u2014a dopey teenager who dropped her panties and got in over her head. A generation and more ago, that's who most unwed mothers were. But according to the most recent statistics from the Centers for Disease Control, teenagers account for only 23 percent of current out-of-wedlock births. That means the vast majority of unwed mothers are old enough to know what they're doing: Unwed births are surging among women ages 25 to 29. In the last 50 years, there has been an extraordinary decoupling of marriage and procreation. In 1960 about 5 percent of births were to unwed mothers; that figure is now [a record high of nearly 40 percent](http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/2007/r071205.htm). Out-of-wedlock births used to be such a source of shame that families tried to hide them: Singer Bobby Darin was born to a teen mother and raised to believe she was his sister. But now out-of-wedlock births are greeted with a shrug. Some say [they're an understandable response to economic realities](http://www.amazon.com/When-Work-Disappears-World-Urban/dp/0679724176/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204677849&sr=8-1response%20to%20economic%20realities). Others say they're [a liberating change from the shotgun-wedding ethic](http://www.townhall.com/columnists/GeorgeWill/2006/09/17/building_red_america) that shackled two unsuitable people together for life. As Slate's advice columnist, [Dear Prudence](http://www.slate.com/id/2185809/), I get constant reports from the people who are creating the statistics. When I extol the importance of marriage in the advice column, my inbox fills with e-mails from readers who don't see marriage as the passage from single life to a life of commitment. To them, the marriage certificate is the first document in a paper trail that will end with a divorce decree. This doesn't mean my correspondents conclude that men and women shouldn't form unions and even live together, just that it may be wiser not to make your love life official. \"Legal ties are supposed to make it somehow legit? With the divorce rate as high as it is, a live-in girlfriend is just as good,\" wrote one. Readers also like to rebuke me for my preference that two decent people who are committed to each other and find themselves procreating without intending to should provide the stability of marriage for their child. \"Having a child will be stressful and life altering enough. Parents need to work on their relationship on their time schedule.\" \"I feel that a baby is its own blessing. Have that blessing before you get married.\" \"How dare you imply that an unexpected pregnancy should lead to marriage? You are simply out of touch with modern culture.\" That may be. But it also means that modern culture is out of touch with the needs of children. Some researchers identify out-of-wedlock births as the chief cause for the increasing stratification and inequality of American life, the first step that casts children into an ever more rigid caste system. Studies have found that children born to single mothers are vastly more likely to be poor, have behavioral and psychological problems, drop out of high school, and themselves go on to have out-of-wedlock children. For 10 years, [the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study](http://www.fragilefamilies.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University has followed the families of 5,000 children, three-quarters born to unwed parents. According to the research, most of these parents, both women and men, said they wanted to get married\u2014and to each other. But they somehow feel this mutual decision is beyond their power to make. And by not making it, the forces of inertia start pulling them apart. Five years after their children's births, only 16 percent of the couples had married, and 60 percent had split. Among the most poignant letters I get are those from young women wondering whether they will ever convince the father of their children finally to marry them. \"My boyfriend and I have a 4-year-old son. We've broken up but realized that we truly are meant for one another. My father was diagnosed with stage four cancer last year, and I've made it known to my boyfriend how important it is for me to have my father with me when I get married. When I bring up marriage to my boyfriend his reply is we will get married, I promise, but he has not asked me.\" That out-of-wedlock births are a problem for society does get some political attention\u2014the kind of attention that shows there's not a good plan for what to do about them. Mitt Romney mentioned the statistics in [his presidential withdrawal speech](http://thepage.time.com/transcript-of-romneys-speech-withdrawing-from-the-race/). He cites declining religious observance, easily available pornography, and the possibility of gay marriage as the causes\u2014a platform that seems unlikely to reverse the birth trends. Barack Obama, who grew up without a father, believes that a central reason for the ever-increasing rates is the difficult economic circumstances of the working class. In one speech on fatherhood, he talked about the need for government programs to help men become more of a presence in their children's lives and admonished fathers to take their duties seriously. But he didn't mention that one key to effective fatherhood is first becoming a husband. Economists believe humans act rationally (a somewhat irrational belief, if you ask me), so [some conclude](http://www.slate.com/id/2182089/entry/2182090/) that all this out-of-wedlock childbearing is a logical response to market forces, not the result of something as amorphous as \"culture.\" Since many working-class men do not offer the financial stability they used to provide, women see little incentive to marry them. As Obama said, \"[M]any black men simply cannot afford to raise a family.\" (The out-of-wedlock birthrate among black Americans is close to 70 percent.) I'm trying to follow the logic here. I can understand that a woman looking to get married may decide that a man is such a poor economic prospect that he's not husband material (even if a husband with a low income is better than no husband and no income). But how then is that same man, or a string of them, worthy of fathering her children? Scholar Kay Hymowitz, author of [Marriage and Caste in America: Separate and Unequal Families in a Post-Marital Age](http://www.amazon.com/Marriage-Caste-America-Separate-Post-Marital/dp/1566637090/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1201552162&sr=8-1), turns the argument around and says it's not that harsh economic conditions lead to women having children without fathers, but that the decision to have children without fathers leads to harsh, and self-perpetuating, economic conditions. She explains that having the belief that a solid marriage is central to one's life\u2014that it precedes starting a family\u2014encourages woman and men to make important choices based on self-discipline and deliberation. This is a formula \"needed for upward mobility, qualities all the more important in a tough new knowledge economy.\" I get letters all the time that describe the turbulence that results from deciding marriage is archaic. Sometimes the writers start with a conflicted sense of hope. \"My ex is rather immature and irresponsible. I had a recent fling with him that resulted in pregnancy. I am overjoyed with the impending arrival of my baby, but I fear that no one else in my life will feel the same way.\" This is followed by more conflicted and less hopeful letters when the kids are small. \"My boyfriend and I have a child who is almost 2. He also has a daughter and I have two other children. We bought a home together, but a week before we were about to move in, he left me. Now it's four months later, and he's bought me an engagement ring, but I found out he had a girlfriend during the time we were split.\" \"I have two children with my ex-boyfriend. We broke up because last year a paternity test he was ordered to have came back positive. Even though we are not together, I still want my kids to have a father in their life. I also know he is ignoring his new son because he wants nothing to do with the mom, but that little boy also deserves to have a male figure who cares.\" Having unmarried parents can be devastating for children who start out with no cushion in life. In 1999 congressional testimony, [Isabel Sawhill of the Brookings Institution said](http://www.brookings.edu/testimony/1999/0629poverty_sawhill.aspx?p=1) that the increase in single-parent families\u2014mostly due to unwed motherhood in the past few decades\u2014\"can account for virtually all of the increase in child poverty since 1970.\" A recent study found that [the stress of early childhood poverty](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/62c45126-dc1f-11dc-bc82-0000779fd2ac.html) can literally damage developing brains. Hymowitz points out that all classes of Americans once followed the same life script of marriage before children. When divorce rates started soaring in the 1970s, everyone was fleeing their marriages. But then the classes started diverging. The Economist cites statistics that show among college-educated women married between 1990 and 1994, only 16.5 percent were divorced 10 years later. Among those with a high-school education or less who married in those same years, about 40 percent were divorced after a decade. And to avoid the trauma of divorce, those with less education began forgoing marriage altogether. Better-educated women, who once upon a time were at a disadvantage in finding a mate, \"are now more likely to marry than their non-college peers,\" according to the National Marriage Project at Rutgers University. It turns out that outside Hollywood, there aren't too many Murphy Browns\u2014successful, educated women who choose to have children alone. The Murphy Browns actually get married: Only 4 percent of college graduates have children out of wedlock. It's important to offer some caveats. I am not\u2014the researchers are not\u2014advising marriage at all costs. \"Dear Prudence\" letter writers should not marry the jerks whom they had drunken procreative sex with and hope never to see again. Nor do I recommend entering into a union with a clearly unstable, unsuitable partner. A survey by the Center for Law and Social Policy on the benefits for children of having married parents did come to the anodyne conclusion that \"high conflict\" marriages can be as bad for children as having never-married parents. I know. My parents had a \"high conflict,\" violent marriage; I don't recommend it for anyone. Also, growing up in ideal circumstances is no guarantee that one's life will be a happy success, just as growing up in difficult ones does not doom one to be a troubled failure. (See Barack Obama.) But perhaps in our desire not to make moral judgments about personal choices, young women wholly unprepared to be mothers are not getting the message that there are dire consequences of having (unprotected) sex with guys too lame to be fathers. There is a scene in the teen pregnancy movie Juno in which the title character, a 16-year-old who has decided not to abort her unplanned baby but to give it up for adoption, is having an ultrasound. The technician, thinking she has on the examining table another knocked-up teenager planning to raise her child, makes disparaging remarks about children born into those circumstances. We are supposed to loathe this character and cheer when Juno's stepmother puts her in her place. But I found myself sympathetic to the technician. Why is it verboten to express the truth that growing up with a lonely, overwhelmed mother and a missing father is a recipe for childhood pain? Farhad\u2014 Before I go into debate mode here, I wanted to start by saying how much I've enjoyed reading [True Enough](http://www.amazon.com/True-Enough-Learning-Post-Fact-Society/dp/0470050101). You have literally dozens of stories in the book that you've told wonderfully, but you've also managed to connect them to illuminating research in psychology and sociology: the whole history of the \"Swift Boat\" campaign, the 2004 Ohio election-fraud meme, 9/11 conspiracy theorists. It's an entertaining and important mix of media theory, cultural criticism, and science journalism. Of course, one of the central themes of True Enough is that we live in excessively partisan times, and in that spirit, I'm now going to shift gears and explain why your argument is hopelessly wrong. I'm kidding, but I think we do disagree on a couple of key points. I find myself agreeing thoroughly with your assessment of the forces at work in each of your anecdotes. What I have trouble with is the global conclusions you draw. You describe your thesis near the beginning: \"The limitless choice we now enjoy over the information we get about our world has loosened our grip on what is\u2014and isn't\u2014true.\" At the end you phrase it this way: \"The particular way in which information now moves through society\u2014on currents of loosely linked online groups and niche media outfits, pushed along by experts and journalists of dubious character, and bolstered by documents that are no longer considered proof of realty\u2014amplifies deception.\" Now, it seems to me that there are two ways to set about determining whether this interpretation is, in fact, true. The first is the media-theory approach, which is to analyze the \"particular way that information now moves,\" thanks to the Web and other modern media forms, and to try to gauge whether there is indeed something structural to these new forms that amplifies deception. The other approach is to look at the problem from a sociological point of view: Is there a general increase in falsehood, or blindly partisan interpretations of the world, that we can see around us, compared with what we saw 20 or 50 years ago? Let me try my hand quickly at both, and perhaps we can get into more detail in the next round. In terms of the flow of information, there is no question that the Internet has made it vastly easier to share complete fabrications\u2014delusional theories, libelous accusations, Photoshopped fantasies\u2014with other human beings. (Just think about the spam!) That we agree on. But I think it is equally true that the rise of the Internet has made it vastly easier to share useful, factual information with other human beings. Because the media landscape is so much more interconnected\u2014thanks largely to the innovation of hypertext (and to Google)\u2014it has also never been easier to fact-check a given piece of information. We had plenty of urban myths during my childhood in the 1970s and early 1980s, but we didn't have [Snopes.com](http://www.snopes.com/) to debunk them. Saying that the Web amplifies deception is, to me, a bit like saying that New York is more dangerous than Baltimore because it has more murders. Yes, in absolute numbers, there are more untruths on the Web than we had in the heyday of print or mass media, but there are also more truths out there. We've seen that big, decentralized systems like open-source software and Wikipedia aren't perfect, but over time they do trend toward more accuracy and stability. I think that will increasingly be the case as more and more of our news migrates to the Web. That's why I think it's important to note that many of your key examples are dependent on old-style, top-down media distribution. You talk about the American public's continuing belief in a connection between 9/11 and Saddam Hussein; the Swift Boat Veteran ads that distorted the truth of Kerry's record; Lou Dobbs ranting on CNN. These are all distortions that speak to the power of the old mass-media model or the even older political model of the executive branch. (I think it's telling that you only spent a page or two on the [successful fact-checking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rathergate) of the forged CBS draft-dodging memos.) As you say in the book, the Swift Boat meme didn't take off until the group started running television ads. Americans don't connect Saddam to 9/11 because of distributed online niche groups; they make that connection because the vice president of the United States repeatedly went on television to keep the connection alive. That's as old-school as it gets. This leads to the sociological question. One way to think about it is to look at conspiracy theories, which play a prominent role in True Enough. If your premise were right, the new media landscape would have made our culture more amenable to these theories than ever. I don't exactly know how to go about proving this, but I think there's a very strong argument that the country is significantly less conspiratorially minded than it was in the late 1960s and 1970s. Think of the litany from that period: JFK, Castro, faked moon landings, \"Paul Is Dead,\" Roswell. (For what it's worth, the conspiracy page at Wikipedia is dominated by these outdated theories, but perhaps that itself is a conspiracy.) Yes, we have the 9/11 \" [truth movement](http://www.911truth.org/)\" theories, but we also have a number of dogs that didn't bark. Think about the anthrax attacks of 2001\u2014a major act of terrorism against prominent people that has not been solved, and yet there are almost no well-known crank theories about that in circulation. If that had happened in the 1970s, Oliver Stone would be making a movie about it right about now. And then there is the premise that we live in increasingly partisan political times, where our worldviews have diverged so much that we can't agree on basic truths. This is, of course, conventional wisdom\u2014people make offhand references to our partisan political culture all the time\u2014but I think it is a bizarre form of political amnesia. Think back again to the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. Yes, we have Fox News, but we no longer have lynch mobs. We no longer have people getting fire-hosed by the authorities because they want to ride in the front of the bus or war protesters killed on their campuses. We no longer have radical political groups with significant followings arguing for violent revolution; we haven't had a politically motivated assassination attempt in decades. We have broad public consensus on the role of women and minorities in government and the workforce. We no longer have major political figures denouncing the Communists lurking among us. Yes, the right hates the Clintons, and the left hates Bush, but the left hated Nixon just as much, and some of them hated LBJ for good measure. There is far more consensus in the country's political values than there was 30 years ago. We agree on much more than we did back then. I admit that one thing has changed: Our political culture looks more partisan on television than it did back then, in the sense that Bill O'Reilly is more partisan in style and substance than, say, Cronkite was. But as you know better than anyone, Farhad, just because it's on television, it doesn't mean it's true. Steven Steven, As a [longtime fan of your work](http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/2005/05/01/johnson/), I'm tickled by your kind words, and I'm honored to have the chance to debate True Enough with you here. That said, let's get ready to rumble. You do a nice job summarizing my ideas, but I want to point out that True Enough isn't about the Internet alone. I've got to say this in order to squash the charge\u2014which you don't make, but which I fear others might\u2014that I'm some kind of Luddite. I've spent a career writing for the Web, I get most of my news online, and I consider [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/) a national treasure. So my beef is not with the Internet, exactly, but with the entire modern infosphere: blogs, cable news, talk radio, YouTube, podcasts, on-demand book publishing, etc. In the era of mass media\u2014the 60-year span, give or take, between the advent of television and the advent of the Web\u2014we got all our news from a handful of major sources. Now we get our news from all sides, from amateurs and professionals who span Chris Anderson's [famously long tail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail) of niche outlets. I think you and I agree that this shift will profoundly alter society, and that some changes will be for the good and some will be for the bad. Where we disagree is the bottom line: When it comes to that grand, gauzy thing called Truth, I think niche media will do more harm than good, at least for the foreseeable future. You're right, the Internet is a boon for fact-checking. But how useful is fact-checking if the facts and the lies shuttle about in entirely separate cultural universes? In the book, I spend much time on Leon Festinger's theory of \" [selective exposure](http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/selective_exposure.htm)\"\u2014the idea that in order to avoid [cognitive dissonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance), we all seek out information that jibes with our beliefs and avoid information that conflicts with them. While the theory is controversial, there's ample evidence that selective exposure plays a role in how people parse the news today. [Survey data show](http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?PageID=1067) that folks on the right and folks on the left now swim in very different news pools. Right-wing blogs link to righty sites, while left-wing blogs link to lefty sites. For example, see Lada Adamic and Natalie Glance's [study](http://www.blogpulse.com/papers/2005/AdamicGlanceBlogWWW.pdf) (PDF) or consider [this experiment](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/03/AR2006050300865.html) by Shanto Iyengar and Richard Morin: If you slap the Fox News logo on a generic news story\u2014even a travel or sports story, something completely nonpolitical\u2014Republicans' interest in it shoots up, while Democrats' interest plummets. People now choose their news\u2014and thus their facts\u2014through a partisan lens. Yes, the Swift Boat campaign exploded when it hit TV, but I wouldn't say it depended on \"old-style top-down media distribution.\" The TV we're talking about is cable news, especially Fox: the very definition of a niche partisan outlet. (Fox's biggest show, The O'Reilly Factor, [attracts](http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/ratings/) about 4 million viewers a night; that's big for cable, but it's not the mainstream.) The Swift Boaters initially tried to go the old-media way. In May 2004, they held a press conference at the National Press Club to announce that John Kerry had lied about his time in Vietnam. Reporters from every old-media shop in town showed up, but most dismissed the group. Bereft, the vets went to the Web and talk radio, where they found an audience that lapped up their claims. It was only by winning some fame in these media that the vets garnered a few big donors and, eventually, interest from cable TV. Broadcast news networks, the Associated Press, and national newspapers came to the story much later on. And their role was salutary\u2014online, in print, and on TV, the old-media outlets fact-checked the Swift Boaters very well, debunking most of their claims. But did the facts hurt the story? Not really. On 9/11 and Saddam: Would Dick Cheney have been able to convince the nation of that connection without a partisan press apparatus\u2014Limbaugh, Drudge, O'Reilly, the [Freepers](http://www.freerepublic.com/tag/news-forum/)\u2014at his back? We can't know, of course. I think it's telling, though, that a large percentage of Americans [continued believing the lie](http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2006/09/21/saddam_fiction/) long after even Cheney and the rest of the administration disavowed it. To me, this suggests that the story was propelled by forces far stronger than the vice president. It persisted\u2014and persists\u2014thanks to niche partisan outlets and despite the facts of the matter being available to all online. Of course, you're right that society has found a consensus on many of the most dogged issues of our past. But True Enough doesn't argue that we are markedly more partisan today than we once were. Rather, I'm saying that our partisanship is of a different character. The big historical controversies you mention involved questions of political values\u2014for example, what should be the proper role of women and minorities in society? Disagreement over an issue like global warming, though, doesn't concern values. It's a difference over facts: If you believe the science on global warming, you think we should do something about it. But if you're among the [20 percent to 40 percent of Americans](http://www.pollingreport.com/enviro.htm) who subscribe to different facts on the question, you don't. And on many big issues\u2014the war, terrorism, several areas of science, even [the state of the economy](http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=268)\u2014Americans today not only hold different opinions from one another; they hold different facts. As for conspiracy theories, I can assure you that an alleged governmental role in 9/11 isn't the only thing keeping paranoid Americans up at night. Have you heard Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s [theory on vaccines and autism](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/7395411/deadly_immunity/) (championed now by [John McCain](http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/02/john-mccain-ent.html))? Or Kennedy's theories on the [stolen election What about the [NAFTA superhighway](http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070827/hayes)? Or [HIV denialists](http://www.aliveandwell.org/)? Really, I could go on. \u2014Farhad Farhad, To ensure that you and I don't end up swimming in different pools, let me try to spell out quickly where we agree. First, the modern infosphere is dramatically more diverse in the number and range of perspectives now available. (Taking your cue, I'm referring to the whole panoply here: the Web, cable, talk radio, and so on.) Second, ordinary people have far more control over the perspectives they are exposed to, thanks both to the diversity of media platforms and to the long tail of viewpoints they support. Third, that infosphere is now far more densely interconnected\u2014on the Web, of course, but also on cable. (Bill O'Reilly is just a couple of clicks on the remote away from Keith Olbermann, after all.) I agree completely that you can use these three developments to build an ideological cocoon for yourself if you so choose. But you can also use them to expose yourself to an incredible range of ideas and perspectives\u2014to challenge your assumptions, fact-check arguments, understand where your opponents are coming from, and stitch together your own informed worldview out of those multiple realities. I realize that description sounds ridiculously high-minded. (Even the most urbane Web polymath goes for a little partisan red meat every now and then.) But let's think of it, for our purposes, as the caricature on the other side of the spectrum, the opposite of the dittohead who doesn't believe anything unless he hears it straight from Rush's mouth. What we're trying to figure out is which pole has a stronger magnetic force in this new world: the dittohead or the polymath. In such a connected environment, truth should be able to spread more quickly through the system, assuming people have an interest in truth. But if people are more driven by selective exposure\u2014finding online information that confirms what they already believe\u2014then the system will let them keep truth at bay, assuming their beliefs are untrue. (By the way, I loved the sections of your book on the science of selective exposure.) You invoke the 20 percent to 40 percent of Americans who don't believe the science of global warming as evidence that the forces of selective exposure are stronger than those of truth-seeking. But the percentage of Americans who have both heard of and believe in human-caused climate change has been growing steadily for the last 15 years. Many more Americans now pursue green lifestyles\u2014in their choice of cars, in the products they buy, and in the food they eat. So there's no question the science is making progress and winning converts at a steady rate. But just like the political struggles that dominated the '50s and '60s\u2014which were about facts as much as values, contrary to what you claim\u2014the conversion process takes time. It's frustrating that the change can't happen overnight, but no more frustrating than it was listening to bigots invoking the pseudosciences of sexism or racism in the '60s. I suppose the great, untestable question on global warming is this: If we could rewind the clock and somehow build an international scientific consensus about global warming in, say, 1950, would the American public have embraced the reality of the threat and the need for change more quickly? We'll never know, of course. It would be interesting to compare the spread of information in the post- [Silent Spring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Spring) era, to see whether the environmental science of that period reached a broad public consensus faster than global-warming science has in recent years. If you\u2014or any of Slate's readers\u2014know of studies along those lines, I'd love to hear about them. But we do have one clear social experiment that we can look at on the dittohead-vs.-polymath question. If you and I had been having this debate back in 1990, right as the new infosphere was coming into being\u2014talk radio ascendant, online communities starting to take shape\u2014presumably your prediction would have been that the forces of selective exposure in this new world would drive people into those different pools of information, confirming and amplifying their existing beliefs, strengthening their alliances to their initial tribe, and growing further away from those with different perspectives. My prediction, on the other hand, would have been that the connective, diversifying properties of this new world would express themselves in the opposite direction: people breaking free from the party lines and creating more eclectic political worldviews, stitched together from the diverse experiences that they can now encounter on the screen. What actually happened during that period? Through all the swings back and forth between the two parties, the single most pronounced trend since the early '90s is the steady rise of Americans who consider themselves independent voters, unaligned with either party. (They have tripled in size during that period, by some measures.) Yes, the new information paradigm has been a boon to people who believe only what O'Reilly (or Michael Moore) has to say. But all those independents make me think that the common ground\u2014the space that connects the pools\u2014has become an even more popular place to be. Steven Steven, For two people in a debate over cultural rifts, you and I sure are agreeing on a great deal. I suppose that's one positive sign. That's why I hate to turn this, now, into the most tedious sort of fight\u2014one about interpreting voter stats. There's voluminous poli-sci research on the recent rise of independent voters, and the picture isn't as clear-cut as you say. Yes, the share of Americans who identify as independents has grown over the past couple of decades. At the same time, though, the meaning of independence has shifted: Most unaligned voters now exhibit strong, pseudo-permanent preferences\u2014in surveys as well as in voting behavior\u2014for one party or another. The number of what you might call \"pure\" independents\u2014voters who pick candidates without regard to party and ideology\u2014has been [steadily declining](http://www.allacademic.com/one/prol/prol01/index.php?cmd=prol01_search&offset=0&limit=5&multi_search_search_mode=publication&multi_search_publication_fulltext_mod=fulltext&textfield_submit=true&search_module=multi_search&search=Search&search_field=title_id). And don't overlook all the other signs of growing political polarization. Americans who do identify with parties are now much less willing than in the past to vote across party lines. In the 1970s, liberals [frequently voted](http://www3.brookings.edu/press/books/chapter_1/redandbluenation.pdf) (PDF) for Republicans and conservatives for Democrats. We don't see that sort of behavior anymore. Congress has also grown steadily more partisan; party-line votes on all but the most inconsequential of issues are now the norm. Just look at what's happened to John McCain in the last 10 years\u2014he was against Bush's tax cuts before he was for them, which pretty much says it all, no? Can we blame the new infosphere for this new partisanship? It certainly doesn't deserve all the blame. Gerrymandering, lobbying, campaign-finance rules, 9/11, and Tom DeLay, among other things, have also likely contributed to polarization. The rise of voters who call themselves \"independent\" notwithstanding, we've seen few signs, since 1990, of people reaching for common ground. I agree with you on global warming. Though a large number of Americans still dismisses the science, it does look like facts about climate change are slowly washing over the culture. But let's not forget your question: Would the public of the 1950s\u2014the mass-media public\u2014have accepted the facts sooner than the public of the 2000s, the niche-media public? The question, as you say, is untestable. But on Rachel Carson: Silent Spring was first serialized in The New Yorker in the summer of 1962, and it came out as a book that September. It was a Book-of-the-Month Club title, and quickly hit the New York Times best-seller list. In 1963, CBS Reports, a 60 Minutes-type show, [broadcast an hourlong report](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/20/AR2007032001762.html) on Carson's thesis that the pesticide DDT was causing ecological damage. This was back when one-third of the nation watched CBS\u2014we're talking American Idol-type ratings. The chemical industry mounted a [huge counterattack in the media](http://www.mindfully.org/Pesticide/Rachel-Carson-Silent-Spring.htm). Carson was called a \" [hysterical woman](http://www.time.com/time/time100/scientist/profile/carson03.html),\" assailed as an alarmist, and accused of [overlooking all the benefits of DDT](http://www.nrdc.org/health/pesticides/hcarson.asp). The charges didn't stick. John F. Kennedy's science advisory panel looked into Silent Spring's thesis and supported its claims. The industry largely backed down, and within a few years the government began to regulate DDT. In 1972\u201410 years after Silent Spring's publication, under a Republican administration\u2014the pesticide was [banned for use in the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT#U.S._ban). Just 10 years! Can you imagine the fate that would await Silent Spring if it were serialized in The New Yorker today? You can guess it would get some play: NPR and the big newspapers would go after the story; sites like [TreeHugger](http://www.treehugger.com/) and [Grist](http://www.grist.org/) and maybe Slate and Salon would discuss it; perhaps the network news would interview Carson; and maybe cable news would get to it, too. But picture [the fun](http://mediamatters.org/items/200701180011) Fox News and right-wing blogs would have with it. Carson had researched DDT's effects on the environment for years, but the science was not airtight; there was, as in any emerging field of study, legitimate disagreement among experts over the scope of the problem and the remedy. Today, the right would surely distort that disagreement. In True Enough, I describe the scourge of dubious \"expertise\" we now see in the media\u2014people of questionable credentials (sometimes with undisclosed financial interests) who are called on by TV producers to discuss matters about which they've got no special knowledge. I'll hazard that such experts would flood the zone to fight Carson today, just as [they do on global warming](http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2005/05/some_like_it_hot.html). The anti-environmentalists would produce pseudo-scientific research of their own showing how DDT harms only terrorists, and in fact helps bald eagles live longer, happier lives. This stuff, then, would get passed around the right, attaining a measure of respect and becoming a kind of parallel truth. How long till Glenn Beck begins comparing Carson [to Hitler?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Beck#Global_warming) All speculation, of course. But that seems to me a pretty good template for how objective facts are churned out through the news these days. If Silent Spring were published today, would it lead to a ban of DDT? Maybe. But not fast enough, I worry. I'd been looking forward to this debate, Steven; it's been fun. I probably haven't changed your mind about the Internet's role in society\u2014and you haven't changed mine\u2014but here's hoping that a civil chat between rivals serves as a model for others online. Farhad Writer and Iraq Memory Foundation Director Kanan Makiya was online at Washingtonpost.com on Thursday, March 13, to chat with readers about Slate's series of articles by \"liberal hawks\" reflecting on [why their initial support of the Iraq war was wrong](http://www.slate.com/id/2186757/). Read Makiya's piece [here](http://www.slate.com/id/2186763/). Kanan Makiya: Hello. This is Kanan. I have just joined. _______________________ Peaks Island, Maine: Do you believe that the Sunni militias fostered by the U.S. will, in the long term, enhance stability or undermine it? Kanan Makiya: I think this is still an open question. We don't know. What we do know is that the Iraqi government is at the moment blocking their entry into the police and army and treats them in an overly suspicious manner. That does not bode well for the future _______________________ Antwerp, Belgium: Mr. Makiya, I find your take on the consequences of 30 years of living under a dictatorship very interesting. No doubt any society would need time and careful management to overcome that. I apologize if I come off sounding anti-American, but I can't help but wonder that the total failure (for four years essentially) of the American/U.K. forces to provide basic security in Iraq\u2014border control comes to mind\u2014allowed groups like al-Qaeda to come in and put a crowbar into existing fissures like the Sunni/Shiite divide. I mean, the divisions were there, but there was nobody there to keep these fissures from becoming wider and deeper and deadlier, resulting in an almost civil war. I just heard some American on BBC World arguing that most of the casualties among civilians (nobody even knows how many) were caused by terrorist and sectarian attacks. Probably, but by allowing the situation to deteriorate, I believe the U.S. administration should shoulder at least part of the blame. To summarize, \"shock and awe\" was the start of the war, but I continually have been \"shocked and awed\" by the plain incompetence and the intellectual dishonesty that this U.S. administration has shown in regard of the consequences of this invasion of Iraq. Kanan Makiya: The failure to control Iraq's borders on day one after regime change was a strategic blunder of incalculable consequences. It all goes back to inadequate troop levels not to knock Saddam out, but to maintain the peace after his overthrow. The problem of the borders incidentally pertains not only to Qaeda but to Iranian intelligence and Revolutionary Guard member for whom access into Iraq is until today a very easy thing _______________________ Fairfax, Va.: How much should the media be held accountable for its role in obscuring the truth about Iraq from the American people? Kanan Makiya: I am not sure I would hold the media responsible for telling lies about Iraq. Perhaps much earlier, before August 1990, it should have done more to inform Americans on the atrocities being perpetrated in Iraq. _______________________ dva: I'm struck by Makiya's last paragraph, which talks about the unreadiness of the Iraqis to deal with the world after liberation. (Or \"liberation.\") I've spent my life studying the former Soviet Union and the past twenty years working there, including substantial time as a USAID contractor. His description of the Iraqi people precisely fits the populations of every post-Soviet state I ever have worked in. (It's no surprise, and it says nothing bad about the people, as everyone but the saints simply adapted to get along. How do you respond to a woman who says she hates Yeltsin because she has to break herself again? She did it to fit in the Soviet Union, and now has to do it again.) Lots of Americans, in the U.S. government and out of it, have encountered and dealt with this phenomenon of the atomized population since 1991, and it was first noted after World War II. No one with any historical memory or experience should have expected anything other than this unreadiness to cope with the world from the Iraqi population\u2014nor should anyone have been surprised that shaking it off requires generations. Lots of things weren't thought through in the rush to a \"short victorious war\" in Iraq, but in my humble opinion this is one of the most important omissions. Kanan Makiya: I agree with much of what you say. But was it really possible to \"know\" in advance something like how Iraqis would react? Their whole world was in flux; everything and everybody was on the move. Ideas were palpably changing by the day. I experienced that personally for nearly 4 years. Everything looked like it was possible, and yet it wasn't. Leaders said one thing one day, and another the next. Iraqis were learning what it meant to be political. In the beginning they were like infants in swaddling clothes learning how to walk. Remember how they v=braved the bullets in 2005 to vote. _______________________ Laurel, Md.: How much of the administrative failure was because of de-Baathificaiton? Were a lot of reasonable, functionable individuals kept out of jobs they should have had just because they had joined the party out of employment convenience? Kanan Makiya: The effects if De-Ba'thiification were for the most part psychological. They led Sunnis to feel, understandably so, that they were being targeted. One must, after a experience like Iraq's, hold people accountable. But one also must have structures of forgiveness in place. After all everyone had been implicated in the violenece of the regime after 30 years. _______________________ Trebuchet:\"I underestimated the self-centeredness and sectarianism of the ruling elite and the social impact of 30 years of extreme dictatorship,\" When you are referring to the ruling elite, are you talking about little George and Dick Cheney? Yes, it is hard to overestimate the self-centeredness and sectarianism of that ruling elite, but thankfully, their regime has ended sooner than planned... Kanan Makiya: No. I was not referring to the Bush adminsitration. _______________________ Helena, Mont.: I knew there were atrocities going on in Iraq long before 1990; the U.S. was complicit with Saddam on some things\u2014like giving him chemical weapons. But it is not up to the U.S. to right wrongs in other countries\u2014it is up to the people of those countries. The problem with Iraq is that those against Saddam could not cooperate with each other\u2014the Shia could not cooperate with the Kurds, nor with disaffected Sunni. I hope and pray that we get out of Iraq as soon as possible and don't stay another five or 10 years. Kanan Makiya: There are no obligations. But we live in a world that since WWII has increasingly felt itself connected with the fate of other peoples in far away lands. No one would have dreamed of intervening to stop gross abuses in the 19th century. Since then however the Red Cross, Amnesty, Human Rights Watch have appeared on the scenen, indicating that we are expanding our previsoly very narrow definitions of who we are and who the other is. _______________________ Princeton, N.J.: You keep going on about Saddam's atrocities, but there were equally bad acts occurring in Rwanda, Congo, Darfur, etc. What about Saudi Arabia, where torture and beheadings are commonplace and woman are in virtual slavery? Surely even the acts of Saddam do not justify what we have done to the country of Iraq. Kanan Makiya: The U.S. has not committed atrocities in Iraq that are even remotely comparable to what Saddam did. _______________________ chamsticks: The only good thing to come from this war should be the realization that one nation can't do it by itself. I don't remember when the U.S. became the sheriff of the U.N. or we voted to spend our tax dollars on upholding U.N. resolutions. So many dictatorships, so much misrule. Only an international body of some sort can hope to deal with it; when one nation goes it alone it becomes so obscenely expensive in so many ways that the nation itself will become its own dictatorship, as we seem to be lurching toward. Saddam the torturer being fought by a nation newly won over to the virtues of torture ... I'll know it's well on the way if not already here if the Republicans are re-elected. Kanan Makiya: In general I agree with you. But surely it is better that one nation tries to do good\u2014even if it fails\u2014than that we wait for this international body to come into existence. Unfortunately the U.N. let the people of Iraq down, repeatedly. _______________________ Peaks Island, Maine: Do you believe that the benefits of the war will ultimately outweigh its costs? Kanan Makiya: I honestly don't know at this point in time. It also all depends on how long \"ultimately\" is. I think of Iraq as a kind of Pandora's box, the lid of which the U.S. knocked open. The hope was that politicians could artfully manage the furies that were bound to emerge. That proved unfounded. The furies are now out there doing their terrible work. Eventually they will be tamed. The whole of history is evidence of that. But how long is \"eventually\"? _______________________ Ottawa, Canada : Would you have supported the overthrow of Saddam and his government if he was replaced by another dictator more friendly to the U.S.? Do you think that if this had happened, the situation in Iraq today would be better than it is today? Kanan Makiya: The U.S. did think of replacing Saddam with some army officers. At the time (2002-03) I bristled with anger at the idea. I still would not accept it. And yet I cannot deny that it just might have led to a situation that was better than the one we face at the present. The point however is that one can never know such a thing. One can only work with what one thinks is right, morally speaking, at the time. Consider also the fact that the army was in all likelihood incapable of assuming power in 2003. We did not know this at the time. But the way it just fell apart suggests that its erosion as an institution long preceded the war of 2003 _______________________ Richmond, Va.: Couldn't Iraq , pre-invasion, have been compared to Yugoslavia when Tito was in power, with a strong man holding three separate factions together? As soon as Tito was gone, Yugoslavia broke down into civil war, the same as Iraq did as soon as Saddam was gone. I remember hearing commentators before the war mention this as a possible scenario, so it was predictable. Thoughts? Kanan Makiya: Yes it was a possible scenario. But it was not inevitable. Artful politics could have avoided it, as it could have avoided it in Yugoslavia. To change the course of a polity that has been 3o years in the making, is never a knowable enterprise. It is all about different possibilities that the behavior of individuals\u2014Iraqis and Americans\u2014effect one way or the other. _______________________ New York: Thank you for chatting today. Tom Ricks, in a recent chat, said that he had come to the conclusion that more troops would not have helped at the outset of the Iraq war. He contends that U.S. troops' heavy-handed treatment of Iraqi citizens only drove them to the insurgency. More troops would have compounded the problem. Your thoughts? Kanan Makiya: I don't agree. The U.S. lost control of security on day one, with the outbreak of looting. Iraqis are a people that had known nothing but a surplus of security. To suddenly take all that away and say, in effect, you are on your own, was unforgivable. They felt that no one was in control. And when your whole world is being turned upside down, the feeling that no one is in control is terrifying, and consequently it is conducive of the most irrational forms of behavior. _______________________ Austin, Texas: You focus, understandably, on the consequences of the invasion for the people of Iraq. Certainly that's enormously important. But from a U.S. perspective, it's also necessary to ask whether the U.S. is better off now than it would have been with Saddam in power. Given the cost in U.S. lives, money and international standing, it seems clear to me that the answer is no. What do you think? Kanan Makiya: Sadly, viewed in the very short run, I think you may be right. But what happens after an overly hasty US withdrawal leads the whole region into turmoil. The US entered Iraq, but the whole region has been affected and is today in a state of upheaval\u2014not because of the US action in Iraq alone, but because there is a deep malaise in Arab politics that has been in the making since 1967. That malaise has already spread out and affected the West in 9/11, and it will no doubt continue to affect Europe especially in the years to come. For better or worse we live in a deeply interconnected world. _______________________ Princeton, N.J.: I never said we committed atrocities\u2014I meant we wrecked the country. Look at pictures of Basra before the invasion and compare them with today's. How many Iraqis have died in just five years because of our acts? One in five have been forced out of their homes. Are they better off now than under Saddam? Kanan Makiya: You\u2014i.e., the U.S.\u2014didn't wreck Iraq a fraction as much as we\u2014i.e., Iraqis\u2014did. The looting for instance destroyed orders of magnitude more infrastructure than the war ever did. _______________________ Dorchester, Mass.: Saddam Hussein was not a good leader. Did the people of Iraq ever get close to removing him themselves? If so, did our interference cause that homegrown rebels to cease to exist? Kanan Makiya: The nature of Saddam's system of government was such as to render his removal from inside an impossibility. The only opposition inside Iraq was a dead opposition. How such an admittedly bizarre state of affairs came into being is something I have written a great deal about (Republic of Fear). _______________________ Anonymous: Prior to the US invasion, Iraq was somewhat of a buffer state between Shia Iran and the Sunni Middle East. Iraq had Sunni/Shia intermarriage, dating and shared neighborhoods. This buffer is now broken and Iran seems to be the better for it. Doesn't this raise the chances of a regional war in the Mddle East as the Sunni Arabs seek to tamp down Iran's growing strength? Is this what George Bush meant by fighting them over there\u2014hoping to cause a regional conflict so that both sides would be too busy killing one another to plan attacks on the U.S.? Kanan Makiya: Islam itself is you could say undergoing its own civil war, its own wars of reformation (think of Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries) and Iraq is at the moment one of the prime battlefields. I don't think that this has anything to do with George Bush _______________________ New York: What is your opinion of the \"surge\"? Kanan Makiya: It is a short term strategy that is working, but only in the short term. _______________________ Bethesda, Md.:\"The U.S. has not committed atrocities in Iraq that are even remotely comparable to what Saddam did.\" Wow. Way to twist Princeton's point to avoid giving a real response. How about you try to answer the question he or she actually posed? Kanan Makiya: Iraq was far more dangerous to the region\u2014the Middle East\u2014than the reprehensible Saudi regime is or ever will become. It had after all launched two deeply destructive wars, and was intent on becoming hegemonic in the region. _______________________ Kanan Makiya: Thank you all for participating. I must say good-bye now. On Oct. 1, 1993, a man named Richard Allen Davis kidnapped 12-year-old Polly Klaas during a slumber party at her home in Petaluma, Calif. At the time, Davis was on parole after serving half of a 16-year sentence for a prior kidnapping and had accumulated a 25-year rap sheet with charges ranging from burglary to auto theft to public intoxication. Polly was found raped and murdered a couple of months later, and the public outcry that ensued led to the passage of a California law that mandated stiff prison sentences for convicted felons on their third offense. Davis had more than a dozen convictions when he abducted Polly Klaas. \"Three-strikes\" laws have now been enacted in 26 states, often with the stated purpose of keeping society safe from violent criminals like Richard Davis. But a [new study](http://www.nber.org/papers/w13784) released by the National Bureau of Economic Research finds that three-strikes laws like California's, while discouraging criminals from doing things like smoking pot or shoplifting, may push those who do continue in a life of crime to commit more violent offenses. The study's author, Radha Iyengar, argues that this is because under such laws, felons with a pair of strikes against them have little to lose (and often much to gain) by committing serious crimes rather than minor offenses. Why would stiffer penalties increase violent crime? To understand this seeming paradox, you first need to understand the nature of California's three-strikes law. Not just any offense gets you a first strike. It must be a so-called \"record-aggravating\" offense, which includes violent crimes like assault and rape as well as serious nonviolent crimes such as burglary or drug sales to minors. But after strike one, strikes two and three can come from any felony, including minor offenses like possession of marijuana or even [stealing golf clubs or videotapes](http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/03/05/scotus.three.strikes/). A third strike carries with it a mandatory sentence of at least 25 years in prison. Now, put yourself in the shoes of a two-strike criminal. The prospect of 25 years behind bars for a third offense is likely to give even a hardened criminal pause before he or she crosses the street against the lights. So we'd expect two-strike felons to commit fewer crimes. But suppose you've already decided to break the law\u2014maybe you need to make a quick buck. Are you going to lift a few golf clubs from the local pro shop? Or are you going to hold up a bank? The potential haul from a bank robbery is obviously much greater, and the penalty is the same: Bank robbery will get you decades in the slammer, but if it's your third offense, so will shoplifting. Even if you don't quite have the chutzpah to pull off a bank job, you still might end up committing a more violent crime if you're in a 0-2 hole. Let's say you opt for the golf club caper, but as you're making your getaway, you're cornered by a store security guard. Do you surrender quietly or pull out a gun? If strike three is looming, it's all the same to you whether you end up on trial for shoplifting or armed assault, so why not try to shoot your way out of an arrest? Proponents of three-strikes laws point to declines across the board in crime rates in California during the 1990s, following the passage of the three-strikes law\u2014including rates of violent crime. But crime was dropping around the country during that period, with explanations ranging from [new policing tactics](http://www.city-journal.org/html/9_2_what_weve_learned.html) to the [legalization of abortion](http://www.slate.com/id/33569/entry/33571/). With so much going on, it's hard to know how much, if any, of the decline comes from fear of a third strike. Instead of analyzing aggregate crime data, Iyengar looks at the lawbreaking choices of [individual criminals](#2186903). She examines how their lawbreaking activities change when the three-strikes law is on the books and also how their lawbreaking activities change depending on how many strikes they have against them. Using data from all criminal convictions during 1990 through 1999 in California's three biggest cities\u2014Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego\u2014Iyengar finds that the three-strikes law did indeed have a large effect on the likelihood of recidivating (committing a crime after release from prison) in the two years following a prior offense. For those with one strike, the law reduced recidivism by 14 percent; this doubled to a 28 percent reduction for two-strikers, whose next crime would trigger the minimum 25-year prison term. But that's where the good news ends. Three-strike-eligible criminals who actually do get arrested for a third offense commit more serious crimes. Burglars, for example, become robbers\u2014these are both offenses that involve stealing, but robbery has the added element of force. Similarly, while thefts decline overall, assaults during thefts go up under three strikes, suggesting that an increasing number of thieves may, in desperation, be trying to muscle their way out of a third arrest (as in our golf club example). In general, arrests of three-strike-eligible felons are 20 percent more likely to be violent crimes (relative to no-strike criminals). (A Californian burglar on the verge of a third strike has an even safer option for his next act\u2014take his activities out of state. Just across the border in Arizona, there's no three-strikes law at all, and in neighboring Nevada, the law is rarely invoked. So rather than breaking and entering in Los Angeles, why not take a road trip to Las Vegas or Phoenix instead? It seems that many criminals do. Iyengar finds that a larger fraction of repeat offenders recidivate out of state after the three-strikes law's passage.) Overall, the three-strikes law did have the desired effect of deterring repeat offenders from striking again. But the law's original intent\u2014motivated as it was by Polly Klaas' tragic story\u2014was to avert further violent tragedies by putting habitual criminals away for a good, long time. It's putting away violent criminals, but Iyengar's study suggests it's also making criminals more violent. It's tempting to invoke the law of unintended consequences in thinking about what was perhaps a well-intentioned but flawed piece of legislation. But these consequences could have been entirely anticipated if legislators recognized that criminals, like all of us, often make decisions by rationally weighing the costs and benefits of their actions. Return to [article](#back2186903) To make sure she's making apple-to-apple comparisons among felons, Iyengar compares the actions of criminals whose rap sheets are identical except for the order in which they committed their crimes. Since you don't start counting strikes until the first record-activating offense, order is crucial. For example, someone who is convicted for armed robbery\u2014a record-activating offense\u2014followed by shoplifting will have strike three looming; if he had reversed the order of his offenses, he'd have only one strike. So if the two-striker commits fewer crimes (but more violent ones) relative to the one-striker, we know it's the effect of the three-strikes incentives and not something about the different offense records of the two criminals. I'm shopping for new wheels and was considering a Prius. But one of my co-workers insists that the Prius isn't nearly as green as Toyota boasts, due to the energy required to manufacture the car's battery. The guy also claims that scientific studies have shown that a Prius is more environmentally harmful than a Hummer is. Really? Like those old chestnuts about [poisoned ATM deposit envelopes](http://www.snopes.com/horrors/poison/envelope.asp) and the [dangers of flashing your headlights](http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/lightsout.asp), the bizarre anti-Prius meme cited by your colleague refuses to die. It keeps making the e-mail rounds every few months, with multiple versions landing in the Lantern's inbox. There's a minuscule grain of truth to the allegation, since the Prius' nickel-metal hydride battery is a more complicated beast than your typical [EverStart](http://www.autobatteries.com/brands/everstart.asp). But the rest of the case against the best-selling hybrid? Malarkey. The Hummer-beats-the-Prius talking point began with [this (PDF) from [CNW Marketing Research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNW_Marketing_Research). The report, titled \"Dust to Dust,\" was cited in a [March 2007 editorial](http://clubs.ccsu.edu/Recorder/editorial/editorial_item.asp?NewsID=188) in the Recorder, a student newspaper at Central Connecticut State University. That editorial, in turn, was [praised by Rush Limbaugh](http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_031307/content/01125103.guest.html), thereby guaranteeing its eternal life in blog comments, online forums, and the [musings of George Will](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/11/AR2007041102109.html?hpid=opinionsbox1). The skeptics' basic argument is that the Prius' battery is irredeemably un-green, mostly because of its high nickel content and complex manufacturing process. As a result, \"Dust to Dust\" contends that a Prius will consume $3.25 worth of energy per mile over its cradle-to-grave lifetime. A Hummer H2, by contrast, will use $3.03 per mile and the Hummer H3 just $1.95. Such a contrarian conclusion is manna to those who sneer at Prius owners as effete or snobbish. It's also unsubstantiated bunk. As [numerous](http://www.denialism.com/labels/George%20Will.html) [learned](http://hybridblog.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/08/about_that_cnw_.html) [folks](http://www.pacinst.org/topics/integrity_of_science/case_studies/hummer_vs_prius.pdf) have pointed out, the 458-page \"Dust to Dust\" makes zero sense, and not just because it betrays its scientific shortcomings early on by referring to \"gigajeulles\" of energy. For starters, the report automatically penalizes the Prius by prorating all of Toyota's hybrid research-and-development costs across the relatively small number of Priuses on the road. New technologies obviously require massive upfront investment, so this puts the Prius deep in the energy hole right off the bat. (CNW Marketing defends this decision [here](http://cnwmr.com/nss-folder/automotiveenergy/Response%20to%20Pacific%20Institute.pdf).) Second, \"Dust to Dust\" makes a gaggle of inexplicable assumptions, such as claiming that a Prius will last only 109,000 miles, well below the stated \"industry straight average\" of 178,739 miles\u2014not to mention the whopping 379,000 miles ascribed to the Hummer H1. CNW says that Prius owners simply drive less than their peers, but it's impossible to tell where that data (as well as virtually everything else in the report) come from. In at least seven states, Toyota offers a 150,000-mile warranty on the Prius' hybrid components, including the battery\u2014it's tough to fathom the company's actuaries agreeing to such a warranty if that 109,000-mile figure was correct. (More nutty assumptions are highlighted [here](http://www.my350z.com/forum/showpost.php?p=2494537&postcount=25).) \"Dust to Dust\" also posits that the vast majority of a car's cradle-to-grave energy gets expended during production. That assertion runs contrary to virtually every other analysis of vehicular life cycles, including those conducted by [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/energylab/www/pubs/el00-003.pdf) (PDF) and [Argonne National Laboratory](http://www.transportation.anl.gov/research/technology_analysis/cost_analysis.html). The authors of \"Dust to Dust\" try to explain this discrepancy on pages 277 and 278 of the report, by invoking a truly weird analogy to coffee production. (How weird? CNW proposes factoring a consumer's post-coffee \"bathroom run\" into the commodity's life-cycle equation.) The Lantern is, to say the least, unconvinced, especially since CNW refuses to reveal its methodology\u2014about as bright a red flag as you could ever hope to see. CNW's science is so feeble, in fact, that the Central Connecticut student who first cited it went on to publish a partial [recantation](http://clubs.ccsu.edu/recorder/editorial/editorial_item.asp?NewsID=203), admitting that \"Dust to Dust\" is \"dubious at best.\" (The writer says he's still no fan of gas-electric hybrids, claiming they've been embraced to the exclusion of more promising technologies.) Another major part of the anti-Prius meme is that the car's battery uses 32 pounds of nickel, mined in Sudbury, Ontario. The skeptical e-mails often state that Sudbury is an environmental wasteland that resembles \"a surrealistic scene from the depths of hell.\" That assertion might have been true about three decades ago, long before the Prius. Nickel mining is by no means a clean endeavor, but Sudbury's conditions have [improved in recent years](http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/envision/sudbury/sudbury.htm). On top of that, all cars contain nickel in their frames\u2014the Hummer's frame, for example, has twice as much nickel as the Prius'. Also, nickel is 80 percent to 95 percent recoverable during the [recycling process](http://www.toyota.co.jp/en/environment/recycle/battery/index.html). (Future hybrids [may use lithium batteries](http://www.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=11621) instead of NiMH, though the next-generation Prius does not.) All that said, Toyota acknowledges that manufacturing a Prius is more energy intensive than making a nonhybrid car. Argonne's scientists estimate that producing a pound's worth of a hybrid car requires 38,650 British thermal units, 23 percent more than that required to build a pound of a traditional car. But the Prius' fuel savings can [make up that difference rather quickly](http://www.triplepundit.com/pages/askpablo-time-to-get-a-new-car-002538.php), at least compared with the average car, which gets a measly 22.9 miles per gallon. (The EPA estimates the Prius' fuel efficiency at 48 miles per gallon in the city, 45 on the highway\u2014estimates that Prius owners typically claim are far too low.) Sadly, the Lantern fully expects to continue receiving the same anti-Prius e-mails, citing the same flimsy evidence. Perhaps because of its [association with the glitterati](http://www.hybridcars.com/hybrid-drivers/celebrities.html), the Prius attracts a large amount of venom, mostly from critics who specialize in knocking the stuffing out of straw men. These naysayers gleefully point out the hypocrisy of stars who drive Priuses while jetting around the globe in private planes or lambaste Toyota for milking the car for publicity. None of these critiques should obscure that fact that the Prius represents a step in the right direction\u2014innovation designed to increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions and that the market (abetted by tax breaks) [seems to be rewarding](http://www.canadiandriver.com/news_2008/02/08/080208-2.htm). Will the car slow climate change all by its lonesome? Of course not, but no one has ever suggested as much. Will it soon be eclipsed by newer technologies? Quite likely, and quite hopefully. But attacking the Prius for not being perfect\u2014especially with lame scuttlebutt masquerading as science\u2014strikes the Lantern as dangerously inane. Is there an environmental quandary that's been keeping you up at night? Send it to [ask.the.lantern@gmail.com](mailto:ask.the.lantern@gmail.com), and check this space every Tuesday. The three most familiar economic statistics are all measures of change: inflation, the growth of gross domestic product, and the daily rise or fall in the price of shares. Even so, they do not begin to capture the mad churn of the economy: the growth and bankruptcy of firms; the millions of firings and hirings, which unemployment statistics barely summarize; the movement of goods and services around the world; and the ebb and flow of consumer fads. Under the circumstances, it is strange that economists do not have a satisfactory way of talking about change, yet we do not. As any undergraduate student of economics knows, both microeconomists and macroeconomists tend to describe change in the same way that an advertisement for dishwashing detergent does: \"before\" and \"after.\" When oil cost $20 a barrel, the economy looked like this; now that oil costs $100 a barrel, the economy looks like that. Quite how the process of change occurred\u2014or how quickly\u2014is a problem glossed over in the textbooks and most journals. That is worrying. Perhaps it does not even make sense to compare two static \"before\" and \"after\" states; perhaps \"during\" is everything. In fairness, economists are not blind to this problem. Back in 1923, John Maynard Keynes warned that \"[e]conomists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long past the ocean is flat again.\" He was not the only one with reservations. Yet identifying the problem is easier than solving it, at least using the mathematical tools with which economists are familiar. Several popular books have argued that economists could learn about dynamics from approaches developed in the sciences. Malcolm Gladwell, a journalist, wrote an entire book, The Tipping Point, devoted to the idea that innovations, fashions, and other ideas spread through society in much the same way as a disease does. Read [his New Yorker article that helped inspire the book here](http://www.gladwell.com/1996/1996_06_03_a_tipping.htm). Philip Ball, a science writer, attacked economics more directly in his book, Critical Mass, arguing that economists should learn from physicists' understanding of dynamic processes, such as phase transitions. (An example of a phase transition is when cold water suddenly turns to ice. It turns out that, for example, traffic flows can exhibit phase transitions.) Still others advise economists to look to models of evolutionary dynamics. This is all sage advice, but the details matter. Duncan Watts, who studies dynamic processes on networks, has discovered that neither Ball nor Gladwell has the whole story. Ideas can spread through an economy like a disease or like a phase transition\u2014it all depends on [how the social networks along which the ideas flow are connected](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/magazine/15wwlnidealab.t.html). The Tipping Point focused much attention on highly connected individuals\u2014the \"connectors\" or the \"influencers\"\u2014who were able to spread anything from a fashion trend to a new software release. Gladwell concentrated on them because epidemiologists knew that diseases often spread through such \"connectors.\" But while that is a sensible way of thinking about the spread of a physically contagious disease, Watts points out that ideas can flow along many more connections than do diseases. Perhaps a very complex and difficult idea\u2014a new school of philosophy, perhaps, or a radical approach to software coding\u2014might indeed spread from one expert to another, and live or die depending on whether the \"connectors\" get involved. But if the ideas we are talking about are what MP3 to download or what cut of jeans to wear, the epidemiological model does not apply. Everyone is connected to everyone else, and a new trend will either ripple through the economy like a near-instantaneous phase transition or it will ripple nowhere at all because it never gets started. And in either case, [the \"connectors\" will be irrelevant](http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/122/is-the-tipping-point-toast.html), because we're all so interconnected anyway. My guess is that it is just a matter of time before economists embrace methods from other disciplines in an effort to understand dynamic processes better than we do. But it would be a shame if we looked only to physicists, chemists, and biologists for advice; something would be missing if we did. Duncan Watts, after all, is a sociologist. Bin Laden speaks. Or does he? A new audiotape featuring Osama Bin Laden's voice has [surfaced](http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8VH8OL01&show_article=1) with yet another series of warnings and rebukes from He Who Shall Not Be Found. In this one, Bin Laden accuses the publishers of the Danish Mohammed cartoons\u2014and the pope! \u2014of advancing a \"New Crusade\" sirs of Christendom, he doth protest, \"You went overboard in your unbelief and freed yourselves of the etiquettes of dispute and fighting and went to the extent of publishing these insulting drawings.\" Also, the toons were a greater offense to this newfangled Emily Post of mass murder than the West's killing of Muslim women and children. Small Dead Animals shows that al-Qaida evidently [stole](http://www.smalldeadanimals.com/archives/008306.html) one screen capture in a recent propaganda video from the film 300: \"The Al-Qaeda media braintrust's latest production incorporates images of Spartan spears drenched in the blood of Persians.\" At Commentary's contentions, Emanuele Ottolenghi [writes](http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/ottolenghi/3013): \"Bin Laden has just officially applied the doctrine of taqfir against Europe because of the Danish cartoons. Taqfir, it should be recounted, means the permission to punishment unbelievers by death: unbelief, more than any other sin, dooms souls to hell in Islamic thinking. What Bin Laden said is short for 'Europeans, as a body politic, are apostates. And they deserve to die.' \" \"People like OBL are incapable of seeing and understanding irony, aren't they?\" [says](http://poligazette.com/2008/03/20/bin-laden-threatens-european-union/) Michael van der Galien at PoliGazette. \"Sure, it's perfectly fine to blow yourself up in the middle of a market, in an attempt to kill as many innocent 'non-believers' (and believers) as you can, but publishing a cartoon about the Prophet Muhammed is considered to be 'uncivil' and in breach with 'the etiquettes of dispute and fighting.' \" Steve Skojec [says](http://skojec.wordpress.com/2008/03/20/hey-bin-laden-zip-it/) bring it on: \"If you want a new crusade, Bin Laden, go ahead and go after the pope. Ever hear of the Battle of Lepanto? How about Granada? Vienna? The Catholic armies of the past broke the back of the Ottoman Empire and scattered the warriors of jihad so badly they had to nurse their wounds for centuries.\" The Jawa Report [thinks](http://mypetjawa.mu.nu/archives/191858.php) Bin Laden's dead: \"The Muhammad cartoons were first published in September of 2005! There is literally no doubt in my mind now. This is an old audio, probably from 2006, of bin Laden. As Sahab must have been embarrassed that they had nothing to offer the world on this the anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, so they hurriedly released an old audio they had lying around. The fact that there was no accompanying banner is evidence that they threw this together last minute.\" Pretty much, [adds](http://reportonarrakis.blogspot.com/2008/03/vatican-rejects-bin-ladens-accusation.html) Report on Arrakis: \"Why is Bin Laden harping on news from 2 years ago?

Misspoke? Many news outlets have [reported](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/03/18/a_mccain_gaffe_in_jordan.html) John McCain's \"gaffe\" in Jordan (later repeated elsewhere) when he said it was \"common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al-Qaida is going back into Iran and receiving training and are coming back into Iraq from Iran.\" Joe Lieberman thereafter whispered in McCain's ear that he should have said \"extremists,\" not al-Qaida. The online left, as well as Barack Obama, have jumped all over this item, pointing to it as proof that McCain doesn't know what he's talking about when it comes to national security. But conservatives defend the senator, arguing that there is ample evidence to support his original, retracted claim. At MyDD, Jonathan Singer [asks](http://www.mydd.com/story/2008/3/20/1236/29941): \"Even considering McCain's apparent strength in polling, are Americans really going to elect someone who is fudging the facts about a purported relationship between Iran and Al Qaeda in Iraq in the immediate wake of a presidency in which the administration went to great lengths to allege a connection between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda in order to get the country behind a war in Iraq?\" Blogs for John McCain [retorts](http://blogsforjohnmccain.com/mccain-was-right-about-al-qaeda-and-iran) that the candidate was in fact right about an al-Qaida-Iran nexus running through Iraq: \"It would seem that both the AP and the liberal bloggers jumping on McCain need to educate themselves a bit more. It's pretty obvious that they had no desire to look around to see if there was any evidence that McCain was actually right. All they were interested in was playing 'gotcha' and exploiting it for political gain.\" And Thomas Jocelyn at the Weekly Standard's Blog [says](http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2008/03/mccain_was_right_iran_works_wi.asp) McCain was wrong to apologize for the statement. Among Jocelyn's assertions is that \"the theological differences between Iran and al Qaeda have never been a serious impediment to cooperation. For example, I wrote a [lengthy essay](http://www.claremont.org/publications/pubid.733/pub_detail.asp) on the topic of Iran's cooperation with al Qaeda going back to the early 1990's. And in a [recent piece](http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/014/760sezag.asp), I detailed the evidence cooperation between Iran's chief terrorist, the late Imad Mugniyah, and al Qaeda.\" Your Right Hand Thief [worries](http://righthandthief.blogspot.com/2008/03/theres-call-at-3am.html): \"the 'McCain is \"confused\" meme' feeds into voters' fears that he is too old to be President.

Iraq flak: Today marks the fifth anniversary of the U.S.'s engagement in Iraq. While President Bush [defended](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/20/world/middleeast/19cnd-bush.html) the decision to go to war, bloggers took the opportunity to asses the merits (and, largely, the failures) of Operation Iraqi Freedom\u2014and the president's role. Former hawk Andrew Sullivan notes with cynicism that Iraq is \"all so old news\" and goes on to [explain](http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/03/abu-ghraibs-pho.html), \"One of the more appalling aspects of the president's current cheery, goofy demeanor is that he has clearly sealed off from any psychological absorption that he is and will always be the president who authorized and enforced a new torture regime.\" Liberal Matthew Yglesias [spreads the blame](http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/03/obamas_argument.php) around: \"I often wonder what public opinion might have looked like had the war met with more vigorous opposition. Certainly to me the fact that Tom Daschle, Dick Gephardt, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, etc. were supporting the war was an important consideration.

Obviously that doesn't look like very smart reasoning in retrospect, but I can't have been the only one who was swayed, in part, by the very fact of bipartisan support for the war.\" On Tapped, Dana Goldstein [evaluates](http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=03&year=2008&base_name=thoughts_on_political_theater) the impact of war protests, arguing that they are worthwhile even when they fail to affect policy, for \"it is powerful that hundreds of city councils nationwide have passed resolutions against the Iraq war. If nothing else, those local statements provide a counter-narrative to the pro-war-at-all-costs stance taken by the administration, and let people around the world see the diversity of American opinion.\" There's a different tune at the Weekly Standard's blog, where John Noonan [notes happily](http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2008/03/surprise_most_insurgents_misle.asp), \"It's intensely satisfying to hear that Iraq has become an unrelenting hellhole. ... for insurgents,\" citing evidence that the U.S. situation on the ground has dramatically improved there. His colleague Stephen Hayes [revisits](http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2008/03/the_washington_post_sows_more.asp) the arguments of 2003, insisting that the Bush administration never actually claimed there was an \"operational relationship\" between al-Qaida and Iraq, and that, besides, \"A relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda need not have been 'operational' to have warranted military action to eliminate it.\" Military blogger BlackFive [adds](http://www.blackfive.net/main/2008/03/5-years-on-iraq.html) that Americans need to begin looking at Iraq as an ally, rather than enemy, in the years ahead. He says, \"The proper context is our relationships with Germany and Japan post WWII. We fought a vicious, bloody war against both and even made the only use of nuclear weapons in history against Japan. Yet today we have troops in both countries and they have been allies ever since.\" However, he admits, \"The situation in Iraq is more difficult because the Iraqi Army and state were never actually defeated in combat.\" Iraqi blogger neurotic Iraqi wife [writes](http://neurotic-iraqi-wife.blogspot.com/2008/03/five-gruesome-cyclonic-years.html) that March 2003 was apocryphal for Iraqis and that \"[j]ust like 9/11, everyone knows where they were at that particular moment.\" She goes on to say, \"Its one thing to want freedom for Iraqis, its another thing to want people to die in the name of the so called freedom. Saddam was evil, But I never imagined that there were people as evil as he was. I guess I was wrong!\" At Last of the Iraqis, Baghdad dentist Mohammed offers [a riveting account](http://last-of-iraqis.blogspot.com/2008/03/5-years-of-blood-and-tears.html) of what the past five years have been like for Iraqis. He expresses anger at the United States and those who looted, and he pauses to remember the day the shrines in Samarra were bombed: \"From that day on the sectarian violence escalated in a frightening way it was like cancer taking over Iraq's body, harvesting innocent souls, feeding from fear and hatred, making life even more difficult, leaving more than 1,400 widow women without a supporter, forcing millions to leave their houses and their neighborhoods and forcing more millions to flee the country and tolerating the humiliation they get in the countries they escaped to just to be alive.\" Read [more](http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&q=iraq+war+fifth+anniversary&btnG=Search+Blogs) about the fifth anniversary of the war and see what former hawks are [saying now](http://www.slate.com/id/2186757/) on Slate. Duel arguments: The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Heller v. District of Columbia and [appeared poised](http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-scotus19mar19,0,2685078.story) to end Washington, D.C.'s ban on handguns. Such a decision in the case, the first of its kind to be heard since 1939, bolsters the rights of individual gun owners and is a de facto affirmation of an \"originalist\" interpretation of the Constitution. Jack Balkin at Balkinization, a self-professed \"bleeding-heart liberal,\" [writes](http://balkin.blogspot.com/2008/03/liberals-make-fun-of-living.html) that \"the question of whether the 2nd Amendment protects an individual right, including a right to self defense, is not that difficult, at least to me. The framers of the 14th amendment assumed that it was one of the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States. And if a right is a privilege or immunity of citizens of the United States, it hard for me to conclude that it does not bind the United States as well as the individual states.\" Meanwhile, at Concurring Opinions, Bruce Boyden [says](http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2008/03/wheres_lexingto.html) historical context ought to have played a larger role in Heller and contends that Lexington and Concord (and their the Revolutionary War militias) ought to have been the \"paradigmatic case\" of reference. Had the District's lawyers and historians followed this tack, they \"could have made it into a strong point that the Second Amendment is all about militia protection, not urban crime prevention. But they didn't, so Heller has really the only word on the subject.\" At the Volokh Conspiracy, Randy Barnett [warns](http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2008_03_16-2008_03_22.shtml#1205935463) that even a favorable decision might not end up being entirely a boon for gun-rights advocates in the long run: \"[It] could also allow legislators to shift responsibility for assessing constitutionality to the courts. And supporters of the gun rights groups that have so effectively protected the right to arms might become apathetic thinking the courts would protect them.\" Read more on Heller v.

Also in Slate, Dahlia Lithwick [reports](http://www.slate.com/id/2186853/) from oral arguments. The speech: Responding to criticism over the toxic sermons his pastor, Jeremiah Wright, has delivered, Barack Obama delivered his much anticipated [speech](http://www.breitbart.tv/html/64224.html) Tuesday on race in America. He tried to explain how Wright's views were in many ways reflective of those of the African-American community, still reeling from the permanent wounds of slavery and Jim Crow and given to anger and frustration that often belies the kind of boundless optimism the candidate has made a hallmark of his campaign. Bloggers largely found the speech stirring and eloquent to an almost unprecedented degree. As for what it will do to help Obama's slightly damaged campaign, they are less sure. Paul Mirengoff at conservative Power Line [writes](http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives2/2008/03/020069.php), \"It will not do to say that Wright is 'part of America.' Lots of deplorable people are part of America, including white racists. Political candidates are not required to embody every strand of America, much less the most noxious hate-filled ones. Political candidates embrace the strands that speak to them, and we should embrace the political candidates whose strands of thinking speak to us. No other candidate for president contains Wright's thinking as 'part of them.' \" Ann Althouse [sees](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2008/03/i-can-no-more-disown-him-than-i-can.html) the speech as a failure: \"I'd say he did not do very much \u2014 other than to resist condemning Wright and to model his socially acceptable attitudes and generate a feeling \u2014 I'm sure you didn't all feel it \u2014 that we need unite behind this man if the terrible divisions over race are going to end.\" Marc Ambinder was more [impressed](http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/03/reflections_on_obamas_speech.php): \"In no uncertain terms did Obama renounce -- morally condemn -- the hateful, anti-Semitic, anti-American and just plain bizarre rants of his pastor -- 'former pastor,' as Obama now calls him. But he did not reject him. He refused to reject him. He is daring, in essence, his white liberal supporters to accept what Wright's anger represents -- a legacy of oppression -- and daring the rest of white supporters to take a leap of faith.\" [So was](http://commentsfromleftfield.com/2008/03/leadership) Kyle E. Moore at Comments From Left Field: \"What he did do was recognize that while Wright was out of line, his inappropriate comments were fueled by a racial tension from a different generation that still feels the wounds of segregation and oppression, wounds that have been passed down to future generations as a result of the fact that Americans continue to fail to deal with race relations in this country in an open and honest matter.\" Will Bunch at Attytood [says](http://www.attytood.com/2008/03/these_people_are_a_part_of_me.html), \"I honestly can't predict how the American heartland will react, but I do think America will be talking about this morning's speech -- like JFK in 1960 -- for generations to come. What happens in the next hour may cost Barack Obama the presidency -- or it may hand him the keys to the White House.\" At the New Republic's Plank, Jonathan Chait [finds](http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/03/18/obama-s-speech-and-one-singular-advantage-of-being-black.aspx) the speech intelligent and subtle\u2014almost too subtle for a politician: \"[Obama] may be liberated to operate at a high intellectual level in public because he's black. I'm not trying to be Gerry Ferraro here; let me explain. Candidates like John Kerry and (even moreso) Al Gore were also very smart, but constantly forced to dumb it down lest they be tagged as out-of-touch elitists. Since the egghead image is so at odds with the prevailing stereotypes about African-Americans, he has much less to fear by speaking at a high intellectual level.\" And John McWhorter guest [posts](http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/03/18/john-mcwhorter-reviews-obama-s-speech.aspx), \"For a light-skinned half-white Ivy League-educated black man to repudiate, in clear language and repeatedly, the take on race of people like Julian Bond and Nikki Giovanni is not only honest but truly bold.\" Steve Benan at the Carpetbagger Report [concludes](http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/14930.html), \"[I]f Obama's address is judged on its merits, it'll be considered one of the high points of the campaign. In this sense, the Wright controversy may ultimately prove to be a blessing in disguise \u2014 it prompted Obama to deliver one of the great modern speeches on race in America.\" Obama supporter Andrew Sullivan [was, unsurprisingly, impressed](http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/03/the-speech.html): \"searing, nuanced, gut-wrenching, loyal, and deeply, deeply Christian speech is the most honest speech on race in America in my adult lifetime. It is a speech we have all been waiting for for a generation. Its ability to embrace both the legitimate fears and resentments of whites and the understandable anger and dashed hopes of many blacks was, in my view, unique in recent American history.\" But Bull Dog Pundit at Ankle Biting Pundits thinks the speech reads like a \"lecture\" and spots the following [contradiction](http://www.anklebitingpundits.com/content/?p=3087): \"[H]e tries to say that blacks who feel victimized by racism should bind together with others who feel victimized by prejudice (i.e. women, the John Edwards 'millworker' type, and 'immigrants' (does he mean legal or illegal?)) to make things better. But he also discusses the need people who feel this way not to be trapped by their victimhood status and to make their own destiny through hard work.\" Finally, Michael Dawson at The Root [worries](http://www.theroot.com/id/45336) that it's too little, too late: \"[The speech] restored hope among his supporters, and convinced many whom had been skeptical that there was more to the man than just hollow rhetoric. If the racialized anti-Obama campaign is effective, however, and one news source suggests that it already has been (while increasing the net likelihood that blacks will vote for Obama, 56 percent of voters are reported to say that his ties to Wright decrease their likelihood of voting for the Senator), it appears that only a candidate that is politically whiter than Senator Obama can win high national office.\" [Read](http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=obama+speech&btnG=Search+Blogs) more reactions to Obama's speech. Bloggers are worried about the Chinese crackdown on protests in Tibet and making fun of both saggy pants and the ordinances outlawing them. Lhasa trouble: Renewed violence broke out in Tibet's capital city of Lhasa Monday as police began [arresting](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/17/AR2008031700575.html?hpid=moreheadlines) hundreds of Tibetans for participating in protests against Chinese rule last weekend. Tibet's governor acknowledged [16 deaths](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080317/ap_on_re_as/china_tibet;_ylt=AtcxsF0mKLKFTpzYh0C1GpVI2ocA) in the riots, while other sources put the figure at 80 or more. The Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, has [called](http://www.reuters.com/article/newsMaps/idUSSP9714020080316?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0) China's response to the protests \"cultural genocide.\" The crackdown came just days after the Bush administration [removed](http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hC-KW2bK5Q-Jf3QlGoRMG1hkBO1A) China from a list of the world's worst human rights violators. All this, with the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing only months away ... Shanghaiist presents a handy [list](http://shanghaiist.com/2008/03/17/tibet_riots.php) of \"recommended reads\" while organizations like the [International Campaign for Tibet](http://www.savetibet.org/) and [Students for a Free Tibet](http://studentsforafreetibet.org/) offer frequent updates. Kadfly, a tourist who happened to arrive in Lhasa just in time for the uprising, [posted](http://kadfly.blogspot.com/) photos and compelling firsthand descriptions of events on the street. (His reports have been reproduced and widely circulated on [other](http://thepostpostmodern.blogspot.com/2008/03/throwing-stones.html) [blogs](http://victoriachinatownlions.com/2008/03/17/tibet-riot-photos-taken-by-eyewitnesses/).) A quiet morning stroll down Beijing Street turned into running away with a crowd of Tibetans as an empty PLA convoy pulled through. Maybe 100 meters further there was a massive crowd of Tibetans surrounding a narrow alleyway. As it turned out, they were throwing stones and abuse at PLA soldiers who were blockading the passage to a monastery. After a minute or two, everyone rushed the PLA blockade and burst through ... Up until this point the entire situation was almost jovial: there was no sign of danger whatsoever (unless you were a PLA soldier). Then things started getting out of control. Shops were taken apart, buses filled with passengers were attacked, motorcyclists were stoned. We fled into the relative safety of a nearby hotel as attention began to be drawn to us and from there we saw the street and nearby stores get ripped apart and more violence. On BoingBoing, Xeni Jardin has posted camera-phone photos and videos of the Tibet protests and [reports](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/03/16/tibet-china-blocks-y.html) that China is blocking its citizens' access to YouTube and other Web sites, \"likely because of content related to the flood of pro-Tibetan-sovereignty protests in Tibet and elsewhere.\" Dan Kennedy at Media Nation [predicts](http://medianation.blogspot.com/2008/03/citizen-journalism-in-tibet.html), \"If this keeps building, we're going to see whether the Age of the Internet is more powerful than the Age of Fax.

The accounts of the rioting from the perspective of Han Chinese living in Lhasa might come as a shock to Americans accustomed to viewing the conflict in simple terms of Buddhist monks vs. Communist soldiers: \"[S]o far the killing and violence seems to have been carried out by the rioters, not the police or military.\" An angry post at Chinese in Vancouver [asks](http://chineseinvancouver.blogspot.com/2008/03/han-chinese-not-humans.html), \"Were the rioters, stoning and killing Han Chinese, not violating human rights of another people? To the westerners, letting the Tibetan rioters free-killing Han Chinese on the streets is 'respect for human rights'?

The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html) leads with a look at how economic [hard times](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/business/21econ.html?ref=todayspaper) are slowly reaching parts of the country that some previously thought would be able to survive the credit crisis without much more than a scratch. As the crisis spreads and now affects confidence in practically all levels of the economy, many are worried this recession will last longer and be more painful than the last two. The [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/print/?nav=globetop) leads with a look at the depressing prospect that 20 years after scientists first started searching for an AIDS vaccine, they may be no closer now than when they first started. Some are worried that future efforts could be doomed after it became clear that \"the most promising contender\" for a vaccine was not only useless but [potentially increased the risk of infection](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/20/AR2008032003398.html). The Wall Street Journal leads its world-wide newsbox with the failure of Michigan lawmakers to agree on holding [a new Democratic primary](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/20/AR2008032003526.html). It marked another blow to Sen. Hillary Clinton, who was counting on do-over votes in Michigan and Florida to narrow Sen. Barack Obama's lead. [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080321/index.htm) leads with the National Weather Service's warning that the floods in the Midwest that led to the deaths of at least 15 people this week [could be just the beginning](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080321/1a_lede21_dom.art.htm). Record rainfalls coupled with melting snow could lead to floods in many areas of the country this spring. The [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/) leads locally with news that officials in Southern California are beginning to reassess the values of homes after the recent downturn in the [housing market](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-taxes21mar21,1,222186.story). This could save homeowners hundreds of dollars in taxes, but it also means less money for counties that are already low on funds. The NYT makes sure to note that some segments of the economy are still doing well, particularly those that rely on exports for much of their business. But, as many have been saying in the past few days, most no longer believe the idea that markets abroad will be able to [sustain a falling domestic economy](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/business/21econ.html?ref=todayspaper). Backed up by widely reported figures that show \"the economy is deteriorating at an accelerating rate,\" much of what the NYT is talking about is based on anecdotal evidence of reduced sales here, job losses there. \"There's a general sense of caution,\" a manager at a Seattle store said. The Post sheds some light on one of the reasons why this caution is so prevalent by off-leading a look at a factor that should be no mystery to anyone who has visited a supermarket in the past year: [Prices are increasing](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/20/AR2008032003517.html). Prices for basic necessities\u2014groceries, health care, gasoline\u2014have increased 9.2 percent since 2006, while the prices for luxuries\u2014such as clothes and new cars\u2014have increased at a much slower pace. It doesn't take an economics degree to figure out that if wages aren't keeping up with the rising prices in basic goods, people will automatically cut back on the nonessential parts of their household budget. This \"helps explain why American workers felt squeezed even before the recent economic distress began,\" says the Post. Two trials of the potential AIDS vaccine were stopped in September, and since then seven others have also been put on hold and [could be canceled](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/20/AR2008032003398.html). These recent developments are leading many experts to question the strategy behind the $500 million that the U.S. government spends annually in AIDS vaccine research. Some believe the vaccine made volunteers more vulnerable to the virus, which, short of actually causing HIV, is pretty much the worst thing that could happen and is bound to have a profound effect on testing for future vaccines. At the very least, it helps underscore how much is still not known about HIV, which has led some to suggest that the public money currently being spent on human trials should instead be devoted to basic research. Now that it seems pretty certain that neither Michigan nor Florida will be holding do-over primaries, the question of what to do about the delegates from the two states is still open. Obama and Clinton can't seem to agree on a plan, and, as the NYT [points out](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/us/politics/21delegates.html?ref=todayspaper), \"the Democratic National Committee and its chairman, Howard Dean, have not offered any guidance.\" Clinton's camp blamed Obama for failing to agree on a plan and warned that disenfranchising voters in Michigan and Florida will hurt the party in November. The LAT fronts a look at how both Democratic contenders are receiving lots of money from Wall Street. Clinton has received at least $6.29 million and Obama $6.03 million, two figures that are much higher than the $2.59 million that has gone to Sen. John McCain. Some are worried the money will mean either candidate would be less willing to [regulate the financial-services industry](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-wallstdems21mar21,1,2337826.story). In other campaign news, everyone goes inside with word that the State Department fired two employees and disciplined another for improperly accessing information from [Obama's passport file](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/us/politics/21passport.html?ref=todayspaper). The department is still investigating, but its spokesman said the employees were motivated by \"imprudent curiosity.\" The WP fronts word that the United Nations presented donors with a supplemental request for almost $1.1 billion [over the next two years](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/20/AR2008032003445.html). The move would increase U.N. expenses by 25 percent and lead to the largest administrative budget in the history of the organization. But here's the rub: The Bush administration is to blame for much of this increase. Even though the United States has long sought to decrease U.N. spending, the Bush administration has been pushing the organization to take on a variety of new and complex tasks that are proving to be quite expensive. But, of course, U.S. officials suggest the United Nations should find savings in other programs that the Bush administration doesn't think are as important. The NYT fronts, and USAT goes inside with, a look at how the recent unrest in [Tibet could have an effect](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/world/asia/21taiwan.html?ref=todayspaper) in tomorrow's [elections in Taiwan](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080321/a_taiwan21.art.htm). The violence that broke out this week in Tibet has threatened what was once thought to be a sure landslide by the pro-China candidate. But now there seems to be a chance that he might lose, as many Taiwanese fear that what is happening in Tibet foreshadows what will happen in Taiwan if they don't take a stand against China. Now that all the initial hoopla has passed, the NYT takes a look at some nagging questions that remain about the investigation of former New York Gov. [Eliot Spitzer](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/nyregion/21justice.html?ref=todayspaper). Officials justify the highly aggressive tactics, which are rare for prostitution cases, by saying that they had to follow the evidence since Spitzer was a public figure. But there's also an interesting question of why there were so many juicy details about Spitzer's encounter in the affidavit, which several experts say \"went far beyond what was necessary.\" If you feel like starting out your Friday confused, be sure to check out the WSJ's look at how companies are explaining [executive compensation in proxy statements](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120604424097452677.html?mod=todays_us_page_one). The Securities and Exchange Commission told hundreds of companies last year that they needed to be more specific, and many have responded with a slew of formulas and explanations that would challenge even the most hardened Wall Street expert. For example, this is how Adobe explains it: \"Target Bonus x Unit Multiplier x Individual Results.\" That seems simple enough, but then goes the definition of what \"unit multiplier\" means: \"Derived from aggregating the target bonus of all participants in the Executive Bonus Plan multiplied by the funding level determined under the funding matrix ...\" And after all that, Adobe's five top executives got the exact same unit multiplier, which (shockingly!) was the maximum number possible. The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html) leads with a look at how the [fifth anniversary](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/20/world/middleeast/20prexy.html?ref=todayspaper) of the invasion of Iraq provided a stark contrast in the different opinions about the war between Republicans and Democrats in Washington. In a speech at the Pentagon, President Bush acknowledged that the conflict has been \"longer and harder and more costly than we anticipated\" but insisted that \"this is a fight America can and must win.\" While Bush emphasized that the \"surge\" in troops is working and has \"opened the door to a major strategic victory,\" Democratic leaders countered that the administration still lacks a clear strategy to get U.S. troops back home. The [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/) leads locally but off-leads a look at the increasing tensions at the Pentagon over how quickly troops [should be withdrawn from Iraq](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-milassess20mar20,1,194667.story). The commanders on the ground want to keep troop levels steady for the foreseeable future, while members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are speaking up in favor of a faster withdrawal. The [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/print/?nav=globetop) leads with the release of 11,000 pages of [Sen. Hillary Clinton's schedules](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/19/AR2008031901317.html) as first lady, which once again served to put a spotlight on the candidate's claims of experience during her years in the White House. [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080320/index.htm) leads with new census data that show [domestic migration](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080320/1a_lede20_dom.art.htm) in the United States has slowed during a time when the housing market has been on a downward spiral. This trend holds true even for the Sun Belt metropolitan areas, which had been experiencing huge growth. \"People are becoming much more risk-averse, much more conservative about moving,\" one expert said. The Wall Street Journal leads its world-wide newsbox with Tibet officials announcing that 24 people have been arrested and charged with endangering state security and other \"grave crimes.\" In a Page One story, the paper describes how many young Tibetan activists are openly favoring [confrontation with China](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120596094739349681.html?mod=todays_us_page_one), regardless of the Dalai Lama's opinion. Although they still revere the Dalai Lama, these young activists say they're willing to use violence to gain independence. The most startling statement from an administration official\u2014not surprisingly\u2014came from Vice President Cheney, who, with what the WP's [Dana Milbank](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/19/AR2008031903353.html) calls his \"trademark ingenuity,\" compared the administration's task in Iraq to that of Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. \"He was willing to withstand the slings and arrows of the political wars in order to get there,\" Cheney said. When an interviewer told him that two-thirds of Americans oppose the Iraq war, Cheney's answer [was succinct](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/19/AR2008031900297.html): \"So?\" He then added that \"you cannot be blown off course by the fluctuations in the public opinion polls.\" Most Americans may think the war was not worth fighting, but yesterday provided a clear illustration of just how far the conflict has fallen in the list of concerns for regular people. Although at least 160 people were arrested in protests across the country, the crowds were relatively small. But at least for one day, the war was back at the [center of the national political debate](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/20/world/middleeast/20prexy.html?ref=todayspaper) as Democrats in Congress used the opportunity to criticize the administration, and the presidential candidates traded barbs over the conflict. Sen. Barack Obama, of course, criticized the two other presidential contenders for voting in favor of the war and also pointed to Sen. John McCain's highly publicized mistake when he declared several times Tuesday that Iran was providing support for al-Qaida in Iraq. \"Maybe that is why he completely fails to understand that the war in Iraq has done more to embolden America's enemies than any strategic choice that we have made in decades,\" [Obama said](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-na-campaign20mar20,1,7916396.story). Meanwhile, Clinton vowed to begin withdrawing troops quickly, and McCain [released a statement](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080320/a_bush20.art.htm) saying that \"America and our allies stand on the precipice of winning a major victory.\" The fact that there's disagreement within the Pentagon on the pace of withdrawal from Iraq is hardly new, but the LAT does manage to shed some light on why the [tensions have flared up once again](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-milassess20mar20,1,194667.story). Gen. David Petraeus and the Joint Chiefs had agreed to put off discussions about troops cuts until this spring. But then Petraeus suggested publicly that there should be a pause in withdrawals, which many saw as an attempt by the ground commanders to circumvent the process, \"effectively cutting the Joint Chiefs out of this spring's debate,\" says the LAT. It is also revealing to note that the Joint Chiefs are still skeptical about the \"surge,\" noting that it hasn't led to much political progress on the ground. In an interesting Page One piece, the WP takes a look at how even though it's been 10 years since al-Qaida declared war against the United States, intelligence agencies haven't had much luck getting high-placed informants [inside the terrorist network](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/19/AR2008031903760.html). Key opportunities were missed earlier, and now many think that penetrating the network is practically impossible due to its heavy security. For a long time, intelligence agencies were stuck in a Cold War mentality that led them to believe informants could be bought with lots of cash, a tactic that hasn't really worked since members of al-Qaida are mostly motivated by religion. \"This is a much more difficult target than the Soviets were,\" says a former CIA official. \"These people are true believers. They're living according to their beliefs, not in the lap of luxury.\" In writing about Clinton's records, the Post chooses to lead with a look at how the former first lady was sidelined after the failure of her [health-care initiative](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/19/AR2008031901317.html), which has already been written about extensively. Still, it mustn't have been easy to choose something to focus on in records that [the NYT describes](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/20/us/politics/20archives.html?ref=todayspaper) as carrying \"all the emotional punch of a factory-worker's timecard.\" Despite the Clinton campaign's assertion that the schedules illustrate how she was involved in key issues, a (redacted) list of events and times can't really shed light on what she was thinking or any influence she might have had behind the scenes. Still, they offered some interesting tidbits, such as the fact that Clinton was involved in the effort to approve NAFTA, which she now says she opposed. Ultimately, though, the schedules show she was involved in many [typical activities for a first lady](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120593865667548595.html?mod=todays_us_page_one), which leads the WSJ to say that \"she may have had a front seat to history, but was often removed from the action.\" In the LAT's op-ed page, [Michael Meyers](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/opinion/la-oew-meyers20mar20,1,5615767.story), the executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, says he was disappointed by Obama's much-heralded speech about race in America. He talked about the differences between the races when \"he should have presented us a pathway out of our racial boxes and a road map for new thinking about race.\" Meyers hoped Obama would \"speak the simple truth that there is no such thing as 'race,' that we all belong to the same race\u2014the human race.\" Instead of looking forward, Obama looked backward and even brought slavery into the discussion. \"We can't be united as a nation if we continue to think racially and give credence to racial experiences and differences based on ethnicity, past victim status and stereotypical categories.\" Fed week continues, and all the papers lead with the latest efforts by the central bank to prevent a long-lasting recession. The Federal Reserve slashed short-term interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point yesterday, which was less than the full percentage point Wall Street was expecting, but investors still cheered the news. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 3.51 percent when the markets closed. The [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/print/?nav=globetop) and [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20080319/index.htm) note it was [more than five years](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080319/1a_lede19_dom.art.htm?loc=interstitialskip). The [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/) does the best job of explaining clearly that the Fed cut [two key rates yesterday](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fi-fed19mar19,1,7326541.story). The federal funds rate, which is the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, was cut to 2.25 percent, while the discount rate, which is what the Fed charges banks for loans, was reduced to 2.5 percent. After the Fed's announcement, banks cut the prime rate, which means many consumers are likely to see a direct benefit on their credit card bills over the next few months. The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html) and Wall Street Journal point out that investors flocked to raise the prices of financial stocks yesterday after two investment firms reported earnings that were [better than expected](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/business/19fed.html?ref=todayspaper). Lehman Brothers, which many had targeted as the next Bear Stearns, saw its shares rise more than 46 percent. The WSJ leads its world-wide newsbox with Sen. Barack Obama's speech on race in America. Obama distanced himself from the more controversial remarks made by his pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr., and used the opportunity to urge Americans to \"move beyond our old racial wounds\" to deal with problems that affect everyone. When it announced the sixth cut in as many months, the Fed recognized that the future looks bleak for the U.S. economy. \"The outlook for economic activity has weakened further,\" the Fed said in a statement. The LAT [points out](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fi-fed19mar19,1,7326541.story) that \"about the most hopeful thing\" the central bank had to say yesterday was that the prices of energy and other commodities are likely to level out this year, but even that is hardly good news because it seems to be based on the assumption that a recession will lead to a drop in demand. And although everyone says the Fed made clear it stands ready to keep cutting, the WP [highlights](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/18/AR2008031800767.html) that \"more huge rate cuts\" seem unlikely. This is partly due to the fact that the Fed can't go much lower and also because of growing inflation fears. The WSJ points out that many in Wall Street are now betting that the federal-funds rate will be [somewhere between](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120586224310945729.html?mod=todays_us_page_one) 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent by the end of the year. The increasing concern about inflation was evident in yesterday's announcement, as two members of the Fed's main policy-setting committee voted against the interest-rate cuts. The NYT says some analysts [interpreted the dissenting votes](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/business/19fed.html?ref=todayspaper) along with the strong warnings about inflation as a sign that the Fed's committee struggled to reach a decision on how much to cut. Wall Street may cheer the rate cuts, but, of course, lower interest rates mean bad news for savers and those on fixed incomes, particularly retirees. \"Savers are taking it on the chin,\" an [analyst tells USAT](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080319/1a_lede19_dom.art.htm?loc=interstitialskip). The LAT points out that's exactly what the Fed wants. By making saving less attractive, the central bank hopes more money will [pour into the stock market](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fi-invest19mar19,1,5267350.story). But there's so much fear surrounding the economy lately that many are willing to take the lower returns in exchange for safety. Meanwhile, the NYT's David Leonhardt says readers shouldn't be embarrassed if they still don't fully understand the reasons [behind the current financial crisis](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/business/19leonhardt.html?ref=todayspaper). \"Your confusion is shared by many people who are in the middle of the crisis,\" he writes. Throughout most of his candidacy, Obama has largely stayed away from talking about race, but yesterday he decided to tackle the issue after receiving lots of negative publicity in recent days due to controversial sermons given by his longtime spiritual mentor. In a speech delivered at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, [Obama said](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/us/politics/19obama.html?ref=todayspaper), \"Wright's comments were not only wrong but divisive,\" but he went further and explained that Wright's statements [reflect the anger and frustration](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/18/AR2008031800200.html) many black Americans feel due to the country's racist past. \"To condemn it without understanding its roots, only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races.\" Obama also said he understood the anger of some whites over affirmative-action policies. \"This is where we are right now. It's a racial stalemate we've been stuck in for years,\" he said. Many describe yesterday's speech as the most important in Obama's career, and a historian tells USAT that it was the most [extensive discussion](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080319/1a_cover19_dom.art.htm) about race ever given by a presidential candidate. The NYT notes [historians](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/us/politics/19assess.html?ref=politics) \"described the speech's candidness on race as almost without precedent,\" and many agree that it will [go down in history](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-campaign19mar19,1,288912.story), regardless of who wins the nomination. The official word from the Obama campaign is that the senator insisted on giving the speech, and he wrote it himself over the past few days. Many quickly praised the speech, but all the papers note it's still not clear how it will play politically. The WSJ talks to some Republicans who say Obama's alliance with Wright can still be [used against him](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120584864369245057.html?mod=todays_us_page_one) because he only spoke up against the statements once they became a political liability. Even some Obama supporters aren't sure this was the best strategy to deal with the controversy. \"The more he has to talk about race, the blacker he becomes in the public imagination,\" a professor tells the paper. Most of the papers' editorial boards swoon over Obama's address and heap praise on the senator for turning a damage-control speech into what the WP calls \" [a teachable moment](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/18/AR2008031802704.html).\" The NYT [says that](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/opinion/19wed1.html?ref=todayspaper) \"it is hard to imagine how he could have handled it better.\" Regardless of whether it ends the controversy over Wright's statements, the LAT says that [the speech](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/opinion/la-ed-speech19mar19,1,1258154.story) \"redefines our national conversation about race and politics.\" [USAT agrees](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080319/edtwo19.art.htm), noting that \"if it does nothing more than promote needed conversations ... it will have served a valuable function.\" For its part, the WSJ says [the speech](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120588322321046835.html?mod=todays_us_opinion) \"was an instructive moment, though not always in the way the Senator intended.\" By blaming \"standard-issue populist straw men of Wall Street and the GOP\" for much of what is wrong in the country, he \"also revealed the extent to which his ideas are neither new nor transcendent.\" The NYT and WP front a look at how the Supreme Court appears ready to declare that the Second Amendment grants an [individual right to own a gun](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/18/AR2008031801354.html). A majority of justices seemed ready to strike down Washington, D.C.'s handgun ban as unconstitutional, but everyone notes it's unclear how they will decide what kind of gun regulations could still be [imposed by the government](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/washington/19scotus.html?ref=todayspaper). In the NYT's op-ed page, Gov. Philip Bredesen of Tennessee puts forward an interesting proposal to help the Democrats avoid \"a long summer of brutal and unnecessary warfare.\" If there's no clear Democratic nominee by the end of the primary season, he suggests that the party should \" [schedule a superdelegate primary](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/opinion/19bredesen.html?ref=todayspaper),\" where they would all get together in a public caucus so a decision can be made before the convention. \"In addition to the practical political benefits, such a plan is also a chance to show America that we are a modern political party focused on results.\" Financial news continues to get top billing as all the papers try to digest the latest news from the Federal Reserve and the markets to figure out how far the current crisis will spread. The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html)' lead story notes that although the stock market didn't plunge as was widely expected, there were several ups and downs as [uncertainty ruled the day on Wall Street](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/18/business/18street.html?ref=todayspaper). The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Monday with a 0.2 percent increase, largely because of the strength of J.P. Morgan, which rose because of the widely held belief that it was able to acquire Bear Stearns at a veritable bargain. The [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/print/?nav=globetop) leads locally, but off-leads news that shares of many of the [largest banks and investment firms](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/17/AR2008031702969.html) plummeted yesterday. The [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/) leads with a look at how many are wondering whether the Fed is taking on [too much risk](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fi-fed18mar18,1,6867787.story) and for how long it can keep pumping money into the economy in its attempt to save the country from a deep recession without hurting the nation's overall finances. Over the past few days, many economists have said that the key question now is not whether the country will enter into a recession, but rather how long it will last. Ordinary Americans seem to agree. [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080318/index.htm) leads with [a poll](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080318/1a_lede18_dom.art.htm) that shows 76 percent of Americans think the country is in a recession. In addition, 79 percent said they're worried about the possibility of a depression that could last several years. The Wall Street Journal leads its world-wide newsbox with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao saying at a news conference that [the Dalai Lama is to blame](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/17/AR2008031700575.html) for the recent violence that has broken out in Tibet. As the protests spread to other parts of China, Jiabao accused the Dalai Lama of trying to get publicity and gain influence in the run-up to the Olympics. Both the NYT and the WSJ, which devotes a separate Page One story to the subject, point out that as investors desperately tried to figure out which company could be the next to follow in Bear Stearns' footsteps they seem to have agreed on a likely candidate: [Lehman Brothers](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/18/business/18street.html?ref=todayspaper). Investors see similarities between the two companies since they're smaller than their main rivals and highly dependent on the mortgage business. But, as the WSJ reports in detail, Lehman isn't willing to go quietly into the night, and its executives are desperately carrying out an [offensive operation](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120580318748743953.html?mod=todays_us_page_one) to quickly dispel any rumors that might crop up about the company's financial situation. How much that will help is anyone's guess, particularly considering that it was less than a week ago that the chief executive of Bear Stearns was on CNBC talking about how the company's \"balance sheet has not weakened at all.\" Even if what Lehman's executives say is true and the company's finances are solid, there's good reason for them to worry if there are persistent rumors that the firm is in trouble. The WP notes that if there's [one central lesson](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/17/AR2008031702969.html) from the fall of Bear Stearns it's that \"investment firms live and die on confidence.\" And as confidence in the markets continues to decrease, the LAT notes there are many who fear that the Fed's latest moves could [turn the central bank into](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fi-fed18mar18,1,6867787.story) \"the nation's chief financier, a role that it was not designed to play and its leaders dearly hope to avoid.\" Everyone points out the Fed is likely to cut its benchmark short-term interest rate today by as much as one percentage point to 2 percent. But the WSJ says the cut may actually be smaller because of persistent [inflation concerns](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120580840784044347.html?mod=todays_us_page_one). Meanwhile, talk on Wall Street yesterday centered around the demise of Bear Stearns and the way the Fed put its own money forward to facilitate the acquisition by JP Morgan. Some expressed concern that the Fed has set a [dangerous precedent](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/18/business/18street.html?ref=todayspaper) and wonder whether the central bank will continue to offer up public money in order to save private institutions. In fact, as both the WP and WSJ note, it's actually possible that the Fed will be able to make money out of selling the $30 billion worth of assets from Bear Stearns, but that all depends on the markets. The LAT also points out that although many are wondering how much [money the Fed has available](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fi-fed18mar18,1,6867787.story), the truth is that it \"has the capacity to create a near-infinite amount of credit,\" and even in the worst case scenario \"taxpayers should not get stuck with the bill.\" Under the headline \"The Week That Shook Wall Street,\" the WSJ fronts an interesting and extremely detailed account of the events that led to the [fall of Bear Stearns](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120580966534444395.html?mod=todays_us_page_one). But if you're still scratching your head over the latest financial news and why it's important, USAT has [a good Q&A](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080318/1a_cover18_dom.art.htm) that starts with the very basic before getting into the details: \"What is an investment bank, and why should I care what happens to one?\" The LAT notes that President Bush tried to express some optimism on the economy but was [immediately criticized](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-bush18mar18,1,7194363.story) for words that \"struck many as discordant and disengaged\" when he thanked Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson \"for working over the weekend.\" Many said that by focusing on Paulson's schedule, he immediately revealed that he \"has no idea what's going on,\" as Rep. Barney Frank put it. Meanwhile, many Democrats were also quick to point out that the administration seems [perfectly willing](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/18/business/18bush.html?ref=todayspaper) to back the bailout of a big investment bank while it ignores the plight of regular people who are being kicked out of their homes. \"Never do I want to hear again from my conservative friends about how brilliant capitalists are, how much they deserve their seven-figure salaries and how government should keep its hands off the private economy,\" writes the Post's [E.J. Dionne Jr](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/17/AR2008031702154.html). As could be expected, the topic quickly spilled into the presidential campaign, which, as the NYT points out, shows how much the economy has taken over as the main issue of the day, even as the [fifth anniversary of the war in Iraq draws near](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/18/business/18bush.html?ref=todayspaper). The Democratic candidates were quick to criticize the Bush administration for failing to do more to prevent the crisis from unraveling, but the LAT [points out](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-econcampaign18mar18,1,5266249.story) that \"none of the candidates offered specific economic policy proposals beyond their past statements addressing the months-old housing mortgage crunch.\" Even their schedules illustrate how the contenders have been caught off-guard by the situation. Sen. Hillary Clinton was supposed to focus on Iraq this week, and Sen. Barack Obama will give what is being billed as a [major speech on race](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/18/us/politics/18wright.html?ref=todayspaper) today. In the WP's op-ed page, [Eugene Robinson](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/17/AR2008031701792.html) writes that criticizing Bush is \"not the same as charting a path out of this mess\" and implores the candidates to start paying attention to the crisis in the economy. In other campaign news, everyone notes that Florida Democrats appear to have given up on plans to redo the [state's presidential primary](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/18/us/politics/18delegates.html?ref=todayspaper). This means the decision on whether to seat the state's delegates at the convention once again falls on the Democratic National Committee. Meanwhile, officials in Michigan [continued to debate](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/18/us/politics/18delegates.html?ref=todayspaper) whether to hold a new vote. Worst career move ever? The WP, like many of the other papers, goes to the Bear Stearns headquarters in Manhattan\u2014where someone taped a $2 bill to one of the building's doors\u2014to do the requisite story about how the firm's employees are [worried about their future](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/16/AR2008031602523.html). \"Would you believe I've been here five days?\" asked one employee who was outside smoking a cigarette. \"Do you know where I came from? J.P. [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080317/index.htm) all lead with, while the Wall Street Journal devotes much of its Page One to, the Federal Reserve announcing a series of moves to try to bring some stability to the increasingly [shaky financial markets](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/17/business/17fed.html?ref=todayspaper). Lest these be confused as just one more of the series of measures the Fed has taken in recent months, the papers make clear that this latest action is Fed opened up its lending practices to make more money available to the biggest investment firms on Wall Street, and cut a key interest rate (the so-called discount window) for financial institutions by [one-quarter of a percentage point](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080317/1a_lede17_dom.art.htm). The central bank also announced it would extend a $30 billion credit line to help J.P. Morgan Chase complete the purchase of Bear Stearns for what the WSJ [calls](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120569598608739825.html?mod=todays_us_page_one) \"the fire-sale price\" of $2 a share. The WSJ leads its world-wide newsbox with the Tibetan protests, which have spread to other parts of western China. The paper says the protests are unlikely to end soon, and they're being \"fueled by rapid communications among the monasteries that serve as centers of Tibetan cultural and spiritual life.\" Although calm was restored in Lhasa, the provincial capital of Tibet, protests continued to break out in other areas. \"Just as soon as the troops stamp out one protest, another pops up,\" [says the LAT](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-fg-tibet17mar17,1,5199510.story). The fall of Bear Stearns marks a spectacular collapse for a titan of Wall Street that at the beginning of last year was worth $20 billion. After a few days of intense negotiations, yesterday the firm was valued at a mere $236 million, or $2 a share, even though its stock had closed at $30 on Friday. The WSJ makes clear that Bear Stearns executives had [little choice](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120569598608739825.html?mod=todays_us_page_one) in the matter as they had to either agree to sell at any price or file for bankruptcy. The Fed took away much of the risk involved in J.P. Morgan's purchase by agreeing to fund up to $30 billion of Bear Stearns' riskier assets, which the WSJ says \"is believed to be the largest Fed advance on record to a single company.\" This is all a bit complicated, and the Fed didn't give many details [about the assets involved](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/17/business/17fed.html?ref=todayspaper), but the bottom line is that, as the WSJ makes clear, \"if the assets decline in value, the Fed\u2014and thus, the U.S. taxpayer\u2014will bear the cost.\" The LAT notes that the fact that such a [large firm fell so quickly](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fi-bearstearns17mar17,1,820161.story) \"underscored the depth of a crisis that threatens the financial system\" as more investors begin to fear that companies won't be able to pay back loans. \"It's amazing that a firm with a storied history that has been respected for all these years has within two weeks literally gone from solvent to insolvent,\" the head of a financial consulting firm said. \"It's scary and it's horrible.\" The WP notes that there may still be trouble ahead for Bear Stearns because shareholders could file lawsuits if there's suspicion that the executives of the company knew on Friday that the company had lost most of its value but decided to [keep that information from investors](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/16/AR2008031601672.html?hpid=topnews). The WSJ says some Bear Stearns employees were already complaining yesterday about the low price of the sale, which could raise problems since they own about one-third of the company's shares. Meanwhile, the Fed's other major move of the day was no less dramatic or important, and the WSJ characterizes it as \"one of the broadest expansions of its lending authority since the 1930s\" because for at least the next six months securities dealers will be able to borrow from the central bank much like traditional banks. By making it possible for the investment firms to borrow money from the central bank as long as they put up collateral, \"the Fed in effect is offering to be a lender of last resort for 20 major Wall Street firms, a role it has previously played only for commercial banks,\" [explains the WP](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/16/AR2008031601672.html?hpid=topnews). And by lowering the discount rate, borrowing this money will be cheaper for both banks and the big investment firms. Although Fed officials insist that these changes are only recognition of the way the modern financial system operates, the WSJ [makes clear](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120571194513840285.html?mod=todays_us_page_one) that they \"also take the central bank into uncharted territory with new and potentially troublesome risks.\" Asian and European markets fell today, and the dollar hit record lows as investors reacted to [the latest news from Wall Street and Washington](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080317/ap_on_bi_ge/world_markets;_ylt=AgHFVX5mLHBbE.q6.qjeaiOs0NUE). U.S. stocks are largely expected to follow the same downward trend once the markets open for the day. Aides to the Dalai Lama said more than 80 people had been killed in the Tibetan clashes, but the LAT notes that information relating to the violence has been difficult to verify as China has made it hard for journalists to [reach the protest sites](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-fg-tibet17mar17,1,5199510.story). In a news conference, the Dalai Lama called for an independent investigation into the [suppression of the protests](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/17/world/asia/17tibet.html?ref=todayspaper) and said that \"some kind of cultural genocide is taking place.\" He also said he doesn't have any power to stop the protests. \"It's a people's movement, so it's up to them. Whatever they do, I have to act accordingly,\" he said. As the fifth anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq approaches, the NYT fronts a look at the much-talked-about decision to dissolve the Iraqi army. The paper talks to some key people involved in the administration at the time and concludes that L. Paul Bremer's decree to disband the army went against an earlier plan to build upon the existing military and led to [bitter disagreements within the administration](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/17/world/middleeast/17bremer.html?ref=todayspaper). Bush approved the plan, but he did so without consulting many in his administration, including the secretary of state and top military leaders on the ground. Colin Powell, who was secretary of state at the time, said he asked Condoleezza Rice, who was national security adviser, for an explanation, but she said she was surprised as well. Although it was always part of the plan to get rid of the Republican Guard units because they were seen as loyal to the old regime, the rest of the army was supposed to stay in place. Significantly, a PowerPoint presentation that outlined the initial plan warned of the inherent risks of dismantling the entire army and putting so many people out on the street in a country with high unemployment. In an interesting Page One piece, the LAT takes a look at the tactics that the Chinese government is taking to spin the Tibetan protests to its own people. They may not need much prodding since many Chinese [don't have a positive view](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/16/AR2008031602649.html) of Tibet anyway, but the government is employing sophisticated PR tactics and emphasizing the attacks of Tibetans against Han Chinese in order to stir an us-vs.-them mentality that [seems to be working](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fg-chispin17mar17,1,1273099.story). \"The government is showing more confidence and learning more about spin,\" said Michael Anti, a well-known Chinese blogger. \"They've learned more PR tactics from Western people. They see the way the White House and the Pentagon do it.\" The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/pageone/scannat/index.html) leads with uncommitted superdelegates fearing a prolonged battle for the Democratic presidential nomination. The Times says the Democratic heavies are \"uncertain about who, if anyone, would step in to fill a leadership vacuum and help guide the contest to a conclusion that would not weaken the Democratic ticket in the general election.\" The [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front) leads with the \"surprising diversity\" of positions John McCain has taken on foreign-policy issues during his time in Congress. \"Taken as a whole, they seem quirky and a la carte, rather than developed from a single philosophy,\" says the LAT. The [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/print/asectionfrontimage.html) leads with the upcoming Supreme Court review of the District of Columbia's 32-year-old ban on handguns. Most of the superdelegates interviewed by the Times [want the nomination battle decided before the Democratic convention](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/us/politics/16delegates.html?hp=&pagewanted=all), but they don't know how to resolve the conflict. Lucky for them, TP has a solution: Pick a candidate. As the Times says, \"[I]t is a virtual certainty that neither candidate will win enough pledged delegates to clinch the nomination,\" so the decision will come down to the votes of the superdelegates. But many of them are \"hoping they will be relieved of making an excruciating decision that could lose them friends and supporters at home.\" A true profile in courage. The NYT adds that while many superdelegates intend to keep their options open, they also said that \"in deciding whom to support, they would adopt what Mr. Obama's campaign has advocated as the essential principle: reflecting the will of the voters.\" If this is the case, and with Obama holding nearly insurmountable (and [growing](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/03/15/obama_wins_7_more_delegates_in.html?hpid=topnews)) leads in the [popular vote](http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=03&year=2008&base_name=clinton_08jerry_brown_92) and [delegate count](http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/03/03/the-number-to-watch-on-tuesday-night.aspx), what are they waiting for? One last note on the NYT's lead: As far as TP can tell, none of the superdelegates interviewed for the story suggested ending the system that gives them a vote. The Republicans have their nominee, and the LAT says he's [sending mixed signals on foreign policy](http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-mccainpolicy16mar16,0,3339321,full.story), allowing him to court both realists and neoconservatives. But the argument for John McCain the realist is based on congressional votes that are at least a decade old, while his current catalog of positions screams \"neocon.\" Nevertheless, McCain's realist supporters believe some of his more hawkish views are just for show. If McCain is elected president, \"there's going to be a lot of disappointment on the neoconservative side,\" said Adm. Bobby Ray Inman, a former top intelligence official and McCain supporter. Whoever the next president is, he or she will receive plenty of late-night phone calls, as suggested in a campaign ad for Hillary Clinton. But the next commander in chief is unlikely to lose much sleep as a result. Former White House advisers tell the WP that presidents are [rarely asked to make major decisions in the middle of the night](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/15/AR2008031502338.html). In other election news, the NYT notes that [nearly one out of three vice presidents have gone on to become president](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/weekinreview/16stolberg.html?ref=todayspaper), yet, according to Andrew Kohut of the Pew Research Center, \"just 1 percent of voters say the vice presidential candidate influences their decision in a presidential race.\" In a separate piece, the NYT suggests, citing no evidence, that Hillary Clinton floated Barack Obama as a possible running mate because [Mark Penn found that the idea polled well](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/weekinreview/16bai.html?ref=todayspaper). When the Supreme Court takes up the case against Washington's gun ban this week, it will have the opportunity to decide once and for all whether the Second Amendment \" [provides an individual right to gun ownership or simply pertains to militia service](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/15/AR2008031502358.html).\" But while the WP notes that \"an endorsement of an individual right would be a monumental change in federal jurisprudence,\" it doesn't explain how it is likely to affect existing federal gun-control legislation. From a local point of view, the Post says that the stakes of the case \"are obviously high for the District.\" But are they? There is [no conclusive evidence](http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/11/18/effectiveness_of_dc_gun_ban_still_a_mystery/) that the handgun ban has reduced crime in a meaningful way. Each of the papers notes the upcoming [five-year anniversary of the war in Iraq](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/weekinreview/16jburns.html?ref=weekinreview&pagewanted=all). The NYT fronts a [familiar-sounding](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/26/world/middleeast/26insurgency.html?ei=5094&en=2a2a5b9d24a4cf05&hp=&ex=1164517200&partner=homepage&pagewanted=all) story on how the insurgency \" [runs on stolen oil profits](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/world/middleeast/16insurgent.html?ref=todayspaper&pagewantedhttp://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/world/middleeast/16insurgent.html?ref=todayspaper&pagewanted=all).\" The WP, meanwhile, publishes an [\"Outlook\" piece](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/14/AR2008031403677_pf.html) that connects America's decision to invade to its thirst for oil, with references to conspiracy theories thrown in for good measure. Elsewhere, the NYT reports that thousands of Tibetans, including Buddhist monks, [clashed with riot police](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/world/asia/16tibet.html?hp=&pagewanted=all) in the Chinese city of Xiahe on Saturday. But the Tibetan capital of Lhasa was [generally quiet](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/15/AR2008031501025_pf.html) a day after violence erupted in the city. Back in America, the NYT says Ben Bernanke is \" [inventing policy on the fly](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/business/16bernanke.html?_r=1&hp=&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all)\" in response to the meltdown in the credit markets. On Tuesday the Fed is expected to lower interest rates for the sixth time since September. Most forecasters think a recession ( [sorry](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/14/AR2008031403389.html)) is inevitable, if not already under way. But, hey, look on [the bright side](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/business/16fund.html?ref=todayspaper). What rhymes with fellatio? ... The NYT [reviews](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/books/review/Chiasson-t.html?ref=todayspaper) David Lehman's anthology The Best American Erotic Poems. The reviewer laments the fact that many of the poems in the book similarly \"make raunchy metaphors out of unlikely foods, weird animals and western topography.\" To be original, he counsels all those young aspiring erotic poets out there, \"write something really filthy,\" like W.H. Auden's Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/), and the [Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/public/page/us_in_todays_paper.html?mod=topnav_0_0002_public) all lead with bad financial news: A big Wall Street investment firm ran out of money to pay off its lenders before being bailed out by the Federal Reserve. The Fed's fix, hatched out in midnight meetings, is temporary; Bear Stearns has 28 days to clean up its act or find a buyer. Wall Street is rattled and stocks are sinking despite the save. The WSJ tops its world-wide newsbox with, and the other papers front, word of violent protests against Chinese rule in Tibet. The cause of the financial turmoil is ... the credit mess! The NYT [notes](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/15/business/15bear.html?pagewanted=1&hp) highest-up of the papers that Bear suffered big time in the recent credit crisis because of its many mortgage-linked investments. The WP is the most apocalyptic, [reporting](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/14/AR2008031401617.html?sid=ST2008031403898) that had the Fed not intervened, Bear's failure \"could have sent multibillion-dollar losses cascading across the world financial system ... threatening to choke off global economic growth.\" (In a separate analysis piece, the NYT [explains](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/14/AR2008031404214.html?hpid%3Dtopnews&sub=AR) the \"Wall St. Domino Theory.\") Near the beginning of its story, the Post paraphrases critics who say the Fed has inappropriately involved itself in the free market and set a precedent that will encourage other firms to be reckless. The WSJ [says](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120550108028136579.html?mod=hpp_us_inside_today) it's \"the first time since the Great Depression that the Fed has lent in this fashion to any entity other than a bank.\" The WSJ adds a human touch to the story, reporting that yesterday some Bear employees called their spouses from work to say they might be out of a job soon. Looking out for the West Coast, the LAT [reports](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-econ15mar15,0,1681974.story) that Bear's CFO says the firm will honor its existing obligations to the state of California in managing two state bond sales. All the papers front ugly news from the capital of Tibet: Hundreds of people in Lhasa are protesting Chinese rule and clashing with Chinese troops. Ten people are reported dead in what the WSJ [calls](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120548761807136401.html?mod=todays_us_nonsub_page_one&apl=y&r=756671) an \"uprising\" (the other papers settle for violence). The Chinese government blames the Dalai Lama, who issued a statement calling for both sides to stop being violent. The WP [reports](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/14/AR2008031401448.html) that some Tibetans are unleashing their long-simmering anger at Chinese domination by attacking shops owned by ethnic Chinese. The papers agree that with Olympic Games coming up in August, the crisis in Tibet puts the Chinese government in a trickier-than-usual PR situation. The NYT [fronts](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/15/us/politics/15donate.html?hp) another reminder that our system for nominating presidential candidates isn't very good. The Democratic Party doesn't know what to do with Michigan and Florida, states whose delegates the Democratic National Committee refuses to honor because local party bosses held early primaries in violation of national party rules. Some party officials in Michigan want a revote, and some Clinton fundraisers are demanding the return of money they gave to the DNC if the party refuses to seat Florida's delegates at the national convention. Neither Barack Obama nor Hillary Clinton campaigned in either state. North Korea is in big food trouble this year, according to a below-the-fold WP [story](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/14/AR2008031404214.html?hpid%3Dtopnews&sub=AR). Every spring, other countries bail out the starving state with food aid, but crop failure in-country and rising food prices worldwide will make this the toughest year for the regime since the mid '90s, when millions of North Koreans died of starvation. The LAT [reports](http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-obama15mar15,0,2299538.story) on Barack Obama's letter to the Huffington Post, in which the senator from Illinois repudiates controversial statements by his church's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. The WP [does one better](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/14/AR2008031404218.html?hpid=topnews), reporting that the Obama campaign has officially severed ties with Wright. The pastor no longer serves on Obama's African-American Religious Leadership Committee. The Times' story reminds readers that Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain last month received the endorsement of controversial pastor John Hagee, who has said some mean things about Catholics. The WP [fronts](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/14/AR2008031403965.html) a look at a U.S.-funded program for training Palestinian security forces, which the Post says is horribly underresourced. U.S. and Jordanian trainers are improvising, doing things like buying gun-shaped cigarette lighters for use in arrest drills. The WP notes that President Bush's 2003 blueprint for Middle East peace calls for an effective Palestinian security force. The LAT [fronts](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-britney15mar15,0,1421107.story) big news that hospital workers at the UCLA Medical Center can't stop spying on flameout pop star Britney Spears. At least 13 have been fired for peeking at her confidential records, at least six have been suspended, and six actual physicians are facing disciplinary measures. One hospital official is quoted saying she doesn't understand why Spears attracts the snoopers when so many other celebrities are also treated at the hospital. Men wear girdles now. The WSJ [fronts](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120553577196338037.html?mod=todays_us_page_one) word that gut-suppressing, butt-supporting undergarments are the new big thing in men's fashion. In case readers doubt that this is a bona fide trend, the Journal reports that sales growth in men's underwear has recently outpaced that of women's. Call him insensitive, immature, or old-fashioned, but TP cannot stop giggling at the \"Flashback Butt Lifting Technology Boxer.\" Imagine it's early 2003, and President George W. Bush presents the following case for invading Iraq: We're about to go to war against Saddam Hussein. Victory on the battlefield will be swift and fairly clean. But then 100,000 U.S. troops will have to occupy Iraq for about 10 years. On average, nearly 1,000 of them will be killed and another 10,000 injured in each of the first 5 years. We'll spend at least $1 trillion on the war and occupation, and possibly trillions more. Toppling Saddam will finish off a ghastly tyranny, but it will also uncork age-old sectarian tensions. More than 100,000 Iraqis will die, a few million will be displaced, and the best we can hope for will be a loosely federated Islamic republic that isn't completely in Iran's pocket. Finally, it will turn out that Saddam had neither weapons of mass destruction nor ties to the planners of 9/11. Our intervention and occupation will serve as the rallying cry for a new crop of terrorists. It is extremely doubtful that Congress would have authorized such a war or that the American people would have shouted, \"Bring it on!\" Some will protest that this counter-scenario is unfair. Nobody at the time predicted all of these outcomes (though several predicted some of them); Bush can't be blamed for the unforeseen consequences of (let us stipulate) a well-intentioned action. However, toting up the war's extravagant costs against its meager (and still-speculative) gains is a valid way to gauge the larger question: Was the invasion worth launching? Was it a good idea? And the war must be appraised not as some abstract vision of an ideally waged war but rather as the actual, existing war that the Bush administration planned and executed. The disastrous consequences that have been unfolding plainly over the past five years are not \"side effects\" of this war but rather the direct, head-on results. For example, it's an evasion to lament that, had then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld listened to the Joint Chiefs and sent twice as many troops, the war would have gone differently. Maybe so, but Rumsfeld wasn't interested in waging that kind of war. He saw the war not so much as a fight about Iraq as a demonstration of a new style of warfare\u2014known as \"military transformation\" or \"the revolution in military affairs\"\u2014that signaled how America would project power in the post-Cold War era. He saw, not incorrectly, a turbulent world of emerging threats, some in remote areas inaccessible from U.S. bases. The large, lumbering armies of old were not so suitable for such conflicts. Hence his emphasis on small, lightweight units of ground forces\u2014fast to mobilize, easy to sustain\u2014and superaccurate bombs and missiles to hit targets that only heavy artillery could destroy in decades past. With the Iraq war (and the Afghanistan conflict before it), he wanted to send rogue regimes and other foes a message: Look what we can do with one hand tied behind our back. If we can overthrow Saddam (and the Taliban) so easily, we can overthrow you, too. It is no surprise, then, that Rumsfeld rejected the argument, made by several Army and Marine generals, that whatever happens on the battlefield, we'll need a few hundred thousand troops to impose order and help form a new Iraq. A large, lengthy occupation would have nullified his whole concept of new-style warfare and its vision of 21st-century geopolitics. In other words, it is not the case, as many critics charge, that Rumsfeld \"miscalculated\" how many troops would be needed for the mission of stabilizing post-Saddam Iraq. Rather, he wasn't interested in that mission. In a National Security Council meeting shortly before the invasion, he insisted that the Pentagon, not the State Department, should take charge of planning for postwar Iraq\u2014because he wanted to ensure that there would be no such planning (and, indeed, there wasn't). A stronger case could be made that the occupation would have gone better had L. Paul Bremer, head of the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority, not issued ( [on whose orders, we still don't know](http://www.slate.com/id/2173554/)) the directives that barred all Baathists from government jobs and disbanded the Iraqi army\u2014thus alienating all Sunnis at a moment when reconciliation was vital and putting tens of thousands of armed young men out on the streets, angry and unemployed. Still, it is unlikely that, even without the directives, a foreign occupier could have staved off sectarian violence for long. The majority Shiites would have naturally taken over the Baghdad government. The Sunnis, a minority accustomed to running things, would have rebelled. Holding early elections in the provincial districts\u2014forming a federal republic from the bottom up\u2014might have eased the factions into power more gradually, enabled them to make adjustments at each stage. We will never know. But again, this was not the way that Bush chose to go. There is yet another way to assess the war: What if Saddam Hussein had not been toppled? Would Iraq be better or worse off? Would the Middle East be more or less stable, the United States safer or in greater danger? The Kurds are no doubt better off without Saddam (though, as a result of U.S. overflight protection, put in place after the 1991 cease-fire, Saddam's mere presence didn't imperil their existence, as it had before the earlier Gulf War). The Sunnis are no doubt worse off. The Shiites\u2014it's a mixed bag. Saddam and his thugs would have continued to kill innocent people\u2014but the victims would have been different, and it is doubtful they would have been as numerous as the victims of the war. Nor would 4 million Iraqis be displaced. Nor would millions more have such severe shortages of health care, electricity, and clean water, or be afraid to walk their own streets. Were postwar Iraq a study in the trade-off between democracy and security, we could discuss it philosophically. But the Iraqis, at the moment, have neither. Strategically, if Saddam had remained, the U.N. inspectors would have failed to find weapons of mass destruction, and thus pressure would have mounted to call off the sanctions. The Duelfer report, though it found no signs of WMD programs, concluded that, without sanctions, Saddam would have tried to start up those programs once again. It is reasonable to infer that if he'd succeeded, he could have threatened his neighbors and deterred intervention. But is it the case that his attempts to rebuild WMD would have succeeded? We and other nations (Western and Arab) would have had to mount more active measures to monitor and block imports of contraband goods. (Even with no sanctions, the '91 cease-fire resolution's ban on WMD would have remained in effect.) It would have been hard but not impossible. International politics is a hard game. That's why it's important to hire skilled diplomats, a profession that this administration, until recently, has undervalued. In any case, Saddam would have taken years to develop these weapons (the [Duelfer report](http://www.slate.com/id/2108000/) concluded that the programs were completely run down), and his efforts would have been detected long before they bore fruit. A civilized nation should never decide to go to war simply because a stable peace is hard to maintain. Yet that is what we did in the spring of 2003. But isn't the surge working? Well, it depends what you mean by \"working.\" In recent months, casualties\u2014American and Iraqi\u2014dropped substantially. However, three points need to be made. First, casualties are rising once more, though not to 2006 levels. Second, while the surge was certainly a factor in reducing casualties, it was far from the only factor. There were also the alliances of convenience between U.S. forces and Sunni tribesmen against the common foe of al-Qaida in Iraq (an alliance that preceded the surge); the moratorium on violence called by Muqtada Sadr and his Shiite militia (a policy that may be suspended as the Sunni militias grow stronger); and the fact that many areas of Iraq had already been ethnically cleansed. More to the point, as Gen. David Petraeus has said many times, there is no military solution to Iraq. The surge has always been a means to an end\u2014a device to create a \"breathing space\" of security in Baghdad so that Iraq's political factions can reach an accommodation. Without a political settlement, the surge\u2014for that matter, the entire U.S. military presence, the blood we have shed, the treasure we have spent\u2014will prove to be little more than a pause. Back to the hypothetical speech at the top of this column, the one that President Bush might have given, had all the consequences of this war been foretold. The striking thing is, this is pretty much the caution that our military leaders are delivering now, in talking about future wars that we are likely to face. Gen. Petraeus made the point in the Army's [field manual on counterinsurgency](http://www.slate.com/id/2145175/) that he supervised before returning last year to Iraq. Such wars, the manual says, are by nature prolonged and costly; they are difficult to win, easy to lose; they require soldiers to be extremely creative and citizens to be ceaselessly patient. One unstated lesson of the field manual is that our political leaders should think very carefully before plunging into war. If we are going to fight a war essentially by ourselves, as we have done in Iraq, our vital interests must clearly be at stake. If we are going to fight a war that does not involve vital interests, as has also been the case with this war, we must form a genuine coalition\u2014to share the burdens but, more than that, to provide legitimacy to the cause. And if we can't do that, we shouldn't go to war at all. "}
