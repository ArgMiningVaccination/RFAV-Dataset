ITY STATEMENT 01/01/2016 -CURRENT Dr. Bobeck's responsibility is to develop and maintain an independent and externally funded, nationally and internationally -recognized research program in poultry nutrition and management, including layers. This will be accomplished through use of modern research techn iques and training of individuals to use these techniques to improve poultry production and health. This hypothesis -driven research will make basic scientific discoveries in nutrition and health in the mechanistic control of nutrient metabolism, immune fun ction, and improved performance and health. The outcomes of research effort will be training of graduate students, application for competitive external research funding, timely publication of results in peer -reviewed scientific journals, and involvement in relevant scientific communities and societies. Dr. Bobeck will also contribute to undergraduate and graduate student instruction, curriculum and course development in nutrition, and related poultry biology and production systems. When Dr. Bobeck participates as an instructor in the Midwest Poultry Consortium Poultry Center of Excellence summer courses program, her efforts will be included in the 30% teaching effort of her 9-month appointment. Dr. Bobeck will also engage in undergraduate student advising. The division of effort is based on the appointment as 70% research and 30% teaching, respectively. This position does not have formal extension or outreach responsibilities other t han those inherent to the research conducted. Involvement in professional and institutional service will be as needed and appropriate. 2020 CV Elizabeth Bobeck, Ph.D. 4 EDUCATION Post-Doctoral Research Fellow , Department of Medic al Microbiology & Immunology University of -2015 Focus: Human , Hematopoietic , and Stem Cell Transplant Biology Post-Doctoral Research Associate, Department of Animal Science Iowa State University ; 2012 -2013 Focus: Applied Poultry Nutrition Ph.D., Department of Animal Science University of Wisconsin -Madison, 2007 -2012 Focus: Poultry Nutrition and Nutritional Immunology B.S.

Independent study 490 1credit ASSISTANT PROFESSOR: STUDENT RECRUITMENT FOR MIDWEST POULTRY CONSORTIUM C ENTER OF EXCELLENCE BACKGROUND One platform where I can positively influence further participation in poultry education and industry is the Midwest Center of Excellence scholarship program. The Midwest Poultry Consortium Center of Excellence was created over 20 years ago as a summer program for universities in the Midwest that had students interested in po ultry, but without a poultry -specific program of their own at their University. To this end, students from 14 Midwestern Universities travel to UW -Madison each summer for 6 weeks of courses (three 2020 CV Elizabeth Bobeck, Ph.D. 24 3-credit courses in a row, each 2 weeks in length) with con tent experts, followed by a 6 -week internship in the poultry industry. The full program is 2 summers long (year 1 and year 2) and credits transfer back to the student's home institution. Students are selected from sponsoring institutions based on academic performance and interest in a poultry -related career. Industry funds scholarships for the majority of students (tuition and housing), and partial scholarships are also awarded where the student is responsible for tuition. I am responsible for teaching and coordinating the Poultry Nutrition course and as of 2020, I am the Site Coordinator as the program has moved to ISU . Dr. Carl Parsons also teaches in the course and I coordinate guest experts. https://www.cals.iastate.edu/news/releases/iowa s are held 8am -5pm with a break for lunch, and typically there are 2 -3 50-minute lectures presented in the morning, with 1 -2 50-minute lectures in the afternoon, and a 2-3-hour lab portion on a daily basis. I raise awareness for the program by hosting Chelsea Russel, who is a coordinator for MPC, in my AnS 223 course each fall. The table below positively reflects my efforts of student recruitment and participation of ISU in the program. In 2017 -2019, ISU was among the top 3 out of 14 schools in terms of highest applicant rate as well as final selected participants.
