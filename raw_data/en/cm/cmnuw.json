Please forward onto any colleagues or students who might benefit. An EVENTS CALENDAR concludes the newsletter and describes spirituality and health related conferences, workshops, and presentations that are happeni ng here locally, nationally, and around the world. This issue includes several opportunities relevant to those interested in spirituality and health , including a \"call-for-papers\" in the area of religion, spiritua lity and depression, information about the NIH loan repayment progr am, a clinical workshop on integrating spirituality into c ognitive behavioral therapy, and a new training program (masters of arts or master of science) in spirituality, theology and health in the United Kingdom. LATEST RESEARCH Divine Love and Spiritual Support Investigators at the Universi ty of Pittsburgh examined the relationship between the experience of divine love in a prospective study of 200 cardiac surgery pat ients. Preoperative interviews collected information on left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association Classification, baseline health (physical and mental), optimism, hope, relig iousness, prayer coping, religious/spiritual coping, and demographics. Divine love was measured about two and one-half year after surgery. Pre-operative positive religious coping predicted experiences of divine love post-operatively, independent of other predictors. Perceived spiritual support appeared to mediate the relationship between positive religious coping and divine love, although no other religious characteristics predi cted divine love. Investigators concluded that further research on divine love and spiritual support was indicated to help guide clinici ans on how to meet their patients spiritual needs and encourage spiritual growth in the post- operative period. Citation : Ai AL, Hall DE. Divine love and deep connections: a long-term followup of patients surviving cardiac surgery . Journal of Aging Research 2011; 841061. Epub 2011 Jun 15 Comment : This is one of the future studies examining factors related to divine love (I feel lov ed by God, God's love is eternal, etc., using Jeff Levin's 4-item scale). This area of research relates to \"divine relations, which Pollner studied in the late 1980s but has received relatively little attention since then. This may be at the source of religion's effects on health, so is important to study. Quality of Life of those Caring for Family Members with Breast Cancer in Iran Researchers at the Karolinska In stitute in Stockholm, Sweden, and Iran University of Medical Scienc es in Tehran, Iran, examined the role of spirituality and religious coping in the coping and quality of life of 150 Iranian family members caring for a family member with breast cancer. Outcomes were quality of life (using the Persian version of the Caregiver Quality of Life Index-Cancer), sense of coherence (Sense of Coherence Scale), and general health CROSSROADS ... Exploring research on religion, spirituality and health (Health Index) that were assessed at baseline and 6 months later. The Spiritual Perspective Scale and Religious Coping Scale were likewise assessed at two time points. While there was a significant overall increase in quality of life over 6 months, sense of coherence, spirituality, and negativ e religious coping all decreased over time. Sense of coherence (positive), negative religious coping (negative), and patients having more severe breast cancer (negative) were the strongest predict ors of quality of life at follow- up. Investigators concluded that despite improved quality of life over time, family caregivers struggle to cope and encouraged the development of support groups for caregivers to provide information and emotional s upport during this time. Citation : Khanjari S, Oskouie F, Langius -Eklof A. Lower sense of coherence, negative religious coping, and disease severity as indicators of a decrease in quality of life in Iranian family caregivers of relatives with breas t cancer during the first 6 months after diagnosis. Cancer Nursing 2011; Jun 13. Comment : Few studies have examined the way family members cope with caring for a loved one with cancer in Iran. Although the particular religious/spiritual measures used in this study had relatively little relationship to quality of life, sense of coherence (a primary predictor) certainly had its r oots in religious beliefs in this culture. Attitudes Toward Treatment of Epilepsy in Rural Tanzania Researchers in the department of neurology at the Ludwig- Maximilians University in Munich Germany examined the attitudes of people (affected and not affected by epilepsy) in rural Tanzania towards the treatment of epilepsy. The sample consisted of 59 persons with epilepsy, 62 relatives, and 46 unrelated villagers (n=167). Semi-structured ques tionnaire examined traditional healing methods including herbal medicine, spiritual healing, scarifications, and spitti ng. Nearly half of the sample (44%) indicated that they believed ep ilepsy could be treated by one of these traditional healing methods. Furthermore, over one-third (34%) said they believed that Christian prayers could cure epilepsy. Persons with epilepsy and family members were more likely to believe that traditi onal healing methods could cure epilepsy than were villagers unfamiliar with and unaffected by the disease. Other factors related to attitudes toward the treatment of epilepsy included gender, tribe, religion and size of village in which they lived. Researchers concluded that not only were traditional healing methods used, but also Christian prayers played an important role in beliefs about the treatment of epilepsy. Citation : Winkler AS, Mayer M, Ombay M. Attitudes towards African traditional medicine and Christian spiritual healing regarding treatment of epilepsy in a rural community of northern Tanzania. African Journal of Traditional and Complementary Alternative Medicine 2009; 30; 7(2): 162-70 Comment : This fascinating study of peopl e with epilepsy, relatives, and neighbors found that many believe in traditional healing methods (apparently because of exper ience of their benefits) that include spiritual healing practice s and Christian prayer. Little systematic research exists on t he benefits of such practices in rural African populations that belie ve strongly in their efficacy.

Interestingly, religious involvement at baseline prior to the diagnosis of breast cancer predicted less perceived growth 24 months after surgery, whereas a positive image of God was unrelated to growth. While some aspects of positive religious coping were associated with greater perceived growth, while other aspects did not, and some aspects were related to less perceived growth. Likewise, negative religious coping was related to either more or less growth depending on the particular item. Passive deferral (leaving everything up to God and not doing anything oneself) was related to less growth; however, spiritual discontent (wondered whether God had abandoned them, questioned God's love, etc.) was related to more perceived growth across time. Citation : Gall TL, Charbonneau C, Florack P. The relationship between religious/spiritual factors and perceived growth following a diagnosis of breast cancer. Psychology and Health 2011; 26(3): 287-305 Commentary : Interesting negative study that seems a bit counter- intuitive. However, the possibilit y that spiritual struggles (negative religious coping) might ultimately lead to greater perceived growth (particularly if worked through) is certainly a notion that is firmly rooted within theological writings. Attitudes toward Spirituality and Spiritual Care by Nurses in Turkey Investigators examined nurses' per ceptions concerning spirituality and spiritual care in a large sample of 319 nurses staffing public hospitals in Turkey (a largely Muslim nation), acquiring responses from 92% of nurses approached. The mean age of nurses was 32 years, and about one-quarter had a bachelor of nursing degree. Results indicated that nurses' per ceptions concerning spirituality and spiritual care were on average \"uncertain\" and not well defined. Results indicated that educ ational level, belief in the evil eye, and part of the hospital in which they were employed was positively related to perceptions of spirituality and spiritual care. However, 60% of nurses ignored patients' spiritual practices (praying, wearing a blue bead agains t the evil eye, etc.), 29% supported such practices, and 11% did not allow them. The highest mean scores for the 17 stat ements about spirituality that were presented was \"I believe spirituality involves only going to mosque/place of worship\" and \"I believe spirituality does not apply to atheists or agnostics.\" The two items rating highest for providing spiritual care were \"I believe nurses can provide spiritual care by having respect for privacy, dignity as well as religious and cultural beliefs of patients\" and \"I believe nurses can provide spiritual care by spending time with a patient giving support and reassurance especially in time of need.\" Those statements receiving the lowest scores were \"I believe nurses can provide spiritual care by arranging a visit by the religious official or the patient's own religious leader if requested\" and \"I believe spirituality involves personal friendships, relationships.\" Citation : Ozbasaran F, Ergul S, Temel AB. Turkish nurses' perceptions of spirituality and spiritual care . Journal of Clinical Nursing 2011; doi: 10. 1111/j.1365-2702.2011.03778.x. Comment : Seems like nurses in Turkey are just about as confused about what spirituality is and what spiritual care involves as nurses in the U.S. Just under two-thirds ignored the spiritual practices of patients and less than 30% supported them, and one out of 10 did not allow patients to engage in spiritual practices in the hospital. The large sample and high response rate make the findings from this study even more significant. A Spiritual Intervention to Help Older Adults Cope with Chronic Disease Researchers at Johns Hopkins conducted a randomized clinical trail involving 100 older chronically ill adults (mean age 66, 62% female) that involved watching a half-hour video and having them complete workbook over a period of 4 weeks. Those in the intervention group viewed a spiritual video titled \"Plans to Prosper: A Patient Guide to Faith and Health\", which featured brief discussion of spirituality and health by physician researchers from Johns Hopkins and Duke University. The video focused on five themes: trusting that a Higher Being had a plan and purpose for life events; cleaning house (getting ri d of destructive habits), giving thanks (appreciating life's blessi ngs), helping others (finding life purpose), and asking for help (social and spiritual support). Those in the control group watched an educational video focused on reducing cardiac risk factors. Neither intervention required additional clinician time. Over a to 8 week period, energy level increased significantly in the in tervention group that watched the spiritual video, and decreased in the education control group. There was also a trend toward decreased health distress in the group watching the spiritual video. No significant differences were found on pain level, mood, health perceptions, illness intrusiveness, or self-efficacy. Citation : McCauley J, Haaz S, Tarp ley MJ, Koenig HG, Bartlett SJ. A randomized controlled trial to assess effectiveness of a spiritually-based intervention to help chronically ill adults. International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine 2011; 41(1): 91-105 Commentary : Simply watching a 28-minute video and filling out a workbook resulted in a significant increase in energy among a group of patients with chronic illne ss. No additional clinician time was required. The only cost in volved the production of the video and the workbook. Seems like a cost-effective intervention to me. NEWS Special Issue of Depression Research and Treatment We will soon be issuing a Call for Papers for a special issue of the journal Depression Research and Treatment (http://www.hi ndawi.com/journals/drt/). This is an Open Access journal from which investigators can download pdf's of articles for free from anywhere in the world. The focus of this issue is spiritual and religious factors in the development, course, and treatment of depression. Papers reporting origi nal data will be given priority, although original data is not requi red. Potential topics to be included but are not limited to: (1) relationships between religion, spirituality and depression (cross-se ctional or prospective); (2) roles that different religious tradi tions play in the prevention or exacerbation of depression in different cultures; (3) effectiveness of religious vs. conventional c ognitive-behavioral treatments (CBT) for depression (may include description of an ongoing clinical trial focused on this comparison); (4) spiritually-integrated intervention (not CBT) used for the treatment of depression/anxiety; (5) interaction that religious involvement may have with either biological treatments (medication, ECT) or psychotherapy for depression; (6) how religious beliefs may exacerbate depression and prolong its course by worsening guilt and increasing anxiety; (7) how religious communities may discourage the use of antidepressants or psychotherapy and may condemn members for being depressed; (8) the spiritual assessment process in patients with depression/anxiety; (9) how to educate mental health professionals on the negative and positive effects on depression that religious involvement may have.
