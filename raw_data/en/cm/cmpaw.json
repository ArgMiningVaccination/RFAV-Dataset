Islamic teachings cover nearly all areas of knowledge, including medical sciences. Islam offers a unique perspective on how to treat wounds and illnesses. Islamic wound treatment methods are distinct and recognized by modern science. For Muslims, the only true treatment for illnesses and injuries is that mentioned in the Holy Quran and practiced by the Holy Prophet himself throughout his lifetime. Islamic treatments for various internal and external wounds and illnesses, such as the use of honey, black cumin, Indian incense, cupping, and cauterization, are extremely beneficial in treating both internal and external wounds. Islamic diets are high in beneficial nutrients for the body, such as ginger, figs, dates, and olive oil, and Islamic rituals such as five daily prayers, ablution, and fasting are very effective at keeping the body wound resistant. A healthy body has a strong immune system that can fight off various illnesses and injuries. To reach a definitive conclusion, a thorough examination of Islam's original and fundamental sources, such as the Holy Quran and the sayings of the Holy Prophet, was carried out. Although modern science has validated the majority of the approaches emphasized by Islamic teachings, much more research is needed to validate Islamic sayings about medical sciences.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-08-14", "cleaned_text": "An Islamic Perspective on Infection Treatment and Wound Healing [https://doi.org/10.3390/rel14081044](https://doi.org/10.3390/rel14081044) [Religion, Ritual, and Healing]( /journal/religions/special_issues/8G2PZO05Y7 )) Abstract: 2014a](#B37-religions-14-01044)). According to Islamic teachings, (Quran 21:107) Islam is a religion that touches on practically every element of human existence and has offers comprehensive guidance on its legal, political, social, and economic facets. Islam offers a distinctive way of living, a humane diet, and medical care for both physical and mental health. The biggest source of Knowledge and guidance in Islam is the Holy Quran and the Sunnah [1](#fn001-religions-14-01044)( [Hamid 2003](#B22-religions-14-01044)). Islam spread across the Arabian Peninsula in the seventh century, providing Muslims with both a highly intellectual and practical code of conduct. Islam has its own medical systems, and traditional Islamic techniques are very effective in treating wounds, injuries, and illnesses. Many Islamic ways and methods of treating ailments have been approved by modern science ( [Walbridge 1998](#B45-religions-14-01044)). Muslims firmly believe that God created all ailments and that he also created the treatments for each one. The Holy Prophet of Islam said \"There is no disease that God Almighty has created, except that he also has created its treatment\" (Majah Vol. 4, Book 31, Hadith 3436). Muslims used different methods for healing cuts and wounds of war, as Islamic history is full of wars, victories, and wounds ( [Hitti 1970](#B27-religions-14-01044)). [Farage 2008](#B20-religions-14-01044)). In addition to apparent incisions on a person's body, wounds can also be internal, mental, or psychological. Feelings and inner serenity can also be wounded. According to Islam, a person is comparable to a computer that combines hardware and software. The human soul is the software, while the body is the hardware. The soul is not a tangible thing, yet it does reside in the body. Islam emphasizes that the soul is the most significant and ever-living thing, whereas the body is only ephemeral. As software is crucial for a computer's performance, so is the soul for an individual's existence. Only one aspect is recognized by modern science, and that is the human body. According to Islam, the soul of a body can also be hurt, and it has a different treatment than the body. Islam regards psychological characteristics, moods, and other such aspects as being a part of the soul. Ibn e Sina explained that the body and soul are linked, but modern science does not acknowledge this. According to Islamic teachings, the soul is extremely essential because it may exist without the body and is inextricably bound to the body ( [Farage 2008](#B20-religions-14-01044)). [Baghcheghi and Koohestani 2021](#B13-religions-14-01044)). In Islam, one's belief system is an intrinsic component of one's soul; if a person has strong faith in a medicine's function and consumes it, the medicine is more likely to treat that person successfully. Belief is a software, and it is a kind of feeling which cannot be touched or manipulated physically. The soul is the major center of Islamic beliefs, with the body coming in second. It is believed that if an individual's spirit is at peace, his or her body will definitely be at rest as well. Offering five times salat, remembering God, reciting the Holy Quran, and other such good habits are encouraged in Islam because Islam considers these actions to be extremely beneficial to the soul. All such practices are healing the soul (the software) of human beings. In Islam, the soul and body have a vital connection ( [Sina 1959](#B42-religions-14-01044)). The Holy Quran did not explicitly define numerous wound-healing treatments, yet this is the best healer for the soul, according to Islam. The Holy Quran specifically mentions honey as an effective wound healer and the Holy Quran as a wonderful healer for humans (Quran Chapter 16:Verse 68). [Healy and Freedman 2006](#B26-religions-14-01044)). To heal the wounds of Muslims, Islam has traditionally used a variety of methods. Several practices were common in the Arabian civilization prior to the origination of Islam, but Islam only endorsed a small number of practices, and the Holy Prophet of Islam focused on specific techniques for treating wounds ( [Arozullah et al. 2018](#B10-religions-14-01044)). Muslims throughout history employed various ways for healing wounds that were not mentioned in the Holy Quran and Sunnah, yet the Quran and Sunnah had established the guidelines for halal and haram. One of the methods for healing wounds was putting a burned mat of palm leaves and inserting the ash in the wounds. Later on, it was proved scientifically that ash is effective in treating the oral fungal infection, hemoptysis. Other methods of healing were the use of Indian incense because it was considered a treatment for more than seven diseases ( [AlRawi et al. 2017](#B8-religions-14-01044)). Cupping and cauterizing were two other famous methods utilized by the Holy Prophet of Islam Hazrat Muhammad to cure different inner and outer wounds of ailing patients during his life time. Honey was applied to wounds of battles during the time of Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) but later on it was proved scientifically that honey can kill the germs from wounds, and it is an effective healer. These methods are still in use in most of the Islamic countries as approved methods for the healing of wounds in Islam ( [Ghazanfar 1995](#B21-religions-14-01044)). [Mayton 2010](#B36-religions-14-01044)). Modern science has proved that all these food items are beneficial for human beings and these fruits and vegetable have the ability to increase the immunity of individuals ( [Dolatkhah et al. 2020](#B17-religions-14-01044)). [2](#fn002-religions-14-01044)has been stressed in the Holy Quran (Quran, Surah An Nisa 4:43). Washing private parts with water and dry soil is more beneficial than cleaning them with tissue paper according to modern science ( [Kamran 2018](#B29-religions-14-01044)). 2. Materials and Methods 3. Islamic Traditional Wound Healing Methods [AlRawi et al. 2017](#B8-religions-14-01044)). The types of wounds in islam and their treatment has been explained in [Table 1](#religions-14-01044-t001). 3.1. The Super Method [Martin 1982](#B31-religions-14-01044)). The Holy Quran is written in a highly symbolic language that is difficult for the general public to comprehend, but men of understanding can decipher its meanings by reading between the lines ( [Stowasser 1995](#B43-religions-14-01044)). As for physical healing, methods in Islam are concerned the Holy Quran directly expressed the importance of honey. God has mentioned honey as a good healer for many diseases in the Holy Quran. In Verse 69 of An Nahl, Allah says: \"From within their (i.e., the bees) bellies comes forth a fluid of many hues, that provides people with a cure (of illnesses)\" (Quran, 16: 69) This verse of the Holy Quran certifies that honey is an active healer for almost all diseases because it is made by a fluid of many hues. Alvarez-Suarez and co-workers approved this in their report and stated that antimicrobial activity is present in all types of honey ( [Alvarez-Suarez et al. 2010](#B9-religions-14-01044)). Modern science has found that honey is antibacterial and has an inhibitory effect on many organisms which are dangerous for human beings. [Table 2](#religions-14-01044-t002)shows few of the bacteria and organisms sensitive to honey, but there are a myriad of bacteria that are sensitive to honey. 3.2. Method 2: Prophet Muhamad (PBUH)'s Methods [al-Qu IV [Al-Jauziyah 2003](#B6-religions-14-01044)). According to research in modern science, the healing of wounds in the skin relies on the availability of trace elements or enzymes which increase the structural components in the repair of tissues. Ashes contain all the required elements for the healing of wounds. Ashes also have the combination of metals which are needed to heal wounds quickly ( [Shaikh and Shaikh 2008](#B41-religions-14-01044)). 3.2.5. Method V [Table 3](#religions-14-01044-t003)shows the importance of black cumin according to modern science. [Hannan et al. 2021](#B24-religions-14-01044)). 3.2.6. Method VI [Al-Bukhari 2020c](#B4-religions-14-01044), Volume 7, Book VII: About Pandemics [Al-Bukhari 2020b](#B3-religions-14-01044))\". \"one should run away from the leper as one runs away from a lion (Muhammad b. Isma'il al-Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 71, Number 609 2020)\". 4. The Impact of Islamic Diet on Wound Healing [Tsugane 2020](#B44-religions-14-01044)). Food and diet are the major components that give immunity and support healing of wounds. For the healing of wounds, diet plays a vital role. External medication only stops the intervention of viruses and bacteria in the wound, but diet heals the body from the inner side of body. [3](#fn003-religions-14-01044)and the other is Haram [4](#fn004-religions-14-01044)or forbidden. Halal food has been identified by the Holy Quran and The Holy Prophet of Islam. God says in the Holy Quran that, \"Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead animals-cattle-beast not slaughtered, blood, the flesh of swine, and the meat of that which has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for other than God...\" (Quran 5:3) ...and intoxicants (Quran 5:91-92).\" [Table 4](#religions-14-01044-t004)lists animals whose flesh is permissible to consume and those whose flesh is not. This table also includes the scientific rationale for permitting or prohibiting a practice. [Haque et al. 2018](#B25-religions-14-01044)). The meat of slaughtered animals is free from toxins and bacteria, and it cannot be an obstacle in the healing of wounds; rather, it precipitates the process of the healing of wounds. The meat of unslaughtered animals can further worsen the situation of wounds. [Naik 2014b](#B38-religions-14-01044)). [Figure 1](#religions-14-01044-f001)are also considered as the fruits of heaven by Muslims. Islam gives a special importance to these fruits. [Al-Farsi and Lee 2008](#B5-religions-14-01044))\". [Hanano et al. 2017](#B23-religions-14-01044)). Polyphenol-containing dates were found to have anticancer effects, as reported by the study of [Eid et al.](#B18-religions-14-01044)( [2014](#B18-religions-14-01044)). 2019](#B11-religions-14-01044)). [Deuraseh 2006](#B16-religions-14-01044)). 5. Healing of Wounds through Daily Practices of Islam [Kumari and Pathak 2021](#B30-religions-14-01044)). [Figure 2](#religions-14-01044-f002)shows the similarities of the postures of Muslim prayers with yoga. [7](#fn007-religions-14-01044)(movements) a minimum of 17 times every day. The number of total Rak'ah is approximately 48 Raka'ah per day which includes all mandatory and optional Rak'ah. Each Rak'ah consists of a series of 7-9 postures. Each posture moves muscles in a certain direction. [Table 5](#religions-14-01044-t005)shows the number of postures and Rak'ah of a practicing Muslim in one day and in a week. [Bradshaw et al. 2008](#B15-religions-14-01044)). Fitness of the body increases the immune system's power, and an enhanced immune system can best heal the wounds ( [Kamran 2018](#B29-religions-14-01044)). Prayers strengthen both the mind and the body. Many problems related to human psychology can also be resolved through the practice of prayers because it strengthens an individual's belief system. [8](#fn008-religions-14-01044)and ablution for those who must offer prayers. It is obvious that physical cleanliness is the best method for fast wound healing, and Muslim cleanliness practices aid in wound healing. While a clean body protects wounds from bacteria, a filthy body welcomes bacteria and diseases and can make the existing wounds even worse. Islamic practices help the wounds to be healed in a fast manner. Allah has stressed in the Holy Quran about cleanliness that, \"Truly, God loves those who turn unto Him in repentance and loves those who purify themselves (Quran 2:222)\". Faith in Islam is an unshaking power which has the ability to command the wishes of the individual. Considering cleanliness as half faith simply means it has a special status in Islam which has not been given to cleanliness in any other religion. The Holy Prophet Muhammad, (PBUH) declared limpidness to be half of faith. \"Purity is half of faith, and the praise of Allah fills the scale (al-Naishapuri Sahih Muslim Book 2, Number 0432)\". [John 1988](#B28-religions-14-01044)).\"And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) and you find no water, perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands (Tayammum)\" (Quran al-Nisa' 4:43). [9](#fn009-religions-14-01044). Muslims observe a period of fasting in one month in a year. Fasting has several physical benefits and it can also provide a period of rest for the digestive system of human beings. [10](#fn010-religions-14-01044)in Islam, which can help men avoid different dangerous diseases. When this practice is not encouraged, or it is made complicated, then youngsters will be attracted towards illegal relations with others. HIV Aids is typically transmitted from one person to another through sexual contact with different people. Marriage also reduces insecure anal sex behavior among heterosexual intravenous drug users, which becomes a complicated issue for human health ( [Mirabi et al. 2013](#B33-religions-14-01044)). [11](#fn011-religions-14-01044), a compulsory act practiced by all Muslim males, has the potential to reduce HIV transmission from an infected female to uninfected male partner ( [Weiss et al. 2009](#B46-religions-14-01044)). [Baguley et al. 2020](#B14-religions-14-01044)). [12](#fn012-religions-14-01044), and brushing teeth are strongly recommended in Muslim cultures, which is responsible for the fast healing of wounds. All these habits are part of Muslim culture ( [Padela and Zaidi 2018](#B39-religions-14-01044)). 6.
