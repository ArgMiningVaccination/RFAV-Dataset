Download experiencing reoc- curring surges of COVID-19 since the World Health Organization (WHO) pro- claimed it a pandemic on March 11th, 2020.[1]Most recently, major waves of in- fections and deaths have been caused by new mutations of the virus, including the Delta[2]and Omicron[3,4]variants. These emerging variants were more infectious, had shorter latency periods, and were more resistant to existing vaccines than the wild-type variant.[5]Not unexpectedly, each new variant and the resulting wave of infections questioned the preparedness of our healthcare systems and detection infrastructures.[6]Oftentimes,thesesurges in infections prompted governments to re- consider any lifting of existing restrictions andtodevisetargetedtestingapproaches.[] Since the inception of the COVID-19 health crisis, mathematical be fundamental in predicting the course of the pandemic in response to various interventions.[8-12]In par- ticular, they have improved our understanding of COVID- 19 spread,[9,13-18]assisted in the implementation of non- pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs),[11,19-22]informed the de- sign of testing and contact tracing campaigns,[16,23-27]helped plan reasonably safe pathways to return to normalcy,[28-30]and guidedvaccineroll-outs.[31-35]Recently,modelshavebeenusedto predict long-term, reoccurring vaccine campaigns and simulate post-pandemic realities\u2014scenarios in which the virus is always presentandthediseaseisendemic.[36-38] Withinthestudyofpost-pandemicscenarios,itisparamount toestablishmodelsofmultiplevariantsofCOVID-19thatcould coexist in an endemic setting, as our societies pursue proac- tive testing and vaccination strategies to mitigate the eects of the virus.[39]The need to study multiple coexisting variants has beendocumentedforseveralyearsinthecontextofinfluenza.[40] Recent work by Lazebnik and Bunimovich-Mendrazitsky rein- forces that such a need is even stronger for understanding the futurecourseoftheCOVID-19pandemic.[41]Todate,existingre- searchonmulti-variantCOVID-19modelinghasmostlyfocused on compartmental models, tailored to predict the interplay be- tween multiple strains and to study the impact of detection ef- fectiveness, NPIs, and vaccines on Anumberofeortshaveinvestigatedthedominanceofdier- entvariantsbased ontheirinfectiousness,[41-46]withtheoretical studiesgroundedinthegrowingliteratureofbi-andmulti-virus models.[47-49]Predictably, whether it is one or multiple variants that are being transmitted, testing is key to halt the spread. In particular, Xu et al.[50]investigated dierent curbing strategies againstnewvariants,stressingoutthattheeectivenessofgood testingandstrictquarantinemaybecomparablewithmoredras- ticmeasuressuchasstay-at-homeorders.[50]Ontheotherhand, there is the eectiveness of NPIs and vaccinesinthepresenceofmultiplestrains.WithrespecttoNPIs, someauthorshaveoeredevidenceinfavoroftheircriticalrole in multi-variant models. For example, results by Yagan et al.[51] support the key role of masks in curbing the spread, and Ar- rudaetal.[52]observedthatarelaxationofrestrictionscorrelates withrapidinfectionincreases.Otherauthors,instead,reporteda weakerroleofNPIsonthemulti-strainepidemictransmission. For example, sults existing models. For example, a study by Bugalia et al.[55]suggested that it is more important that the vaccine is ecacious against the dominant variant, rather than againstanemergingone.Contrastingevidencehasbeenoered byDeLeonetal.,[56]whosemodel-basedapproachattributesthe spread of the Delta variant to its higher resistance to vaccines thanthedominantAlphavariant.Moregenerally,thecriticalrole ofvaccineshasbeeninvestigatedbymanystudies,includingthe workofLaytonandSadria[57]onmulti-variantCOVID-19spread inOntario,Canada;theeortbyDutta[58]ontheroleofvaccines and NPIs on individuals in each specichealthstateandevolveintimeaccordingtocoupleddif- ferential equations describing tion.Theselimitationshindertheirapplicabilitytoreproduceand studythespreadofepidemicdiseasesinsmall-ormedium-size populations,withtheirheterogeneityinthenetworkofcontacts andinthebehavior,demographics,andmobilitypatternsofthe residents. In this work, we seek to ll this gap of knowledge by establishingahigh-resolutionmodelingframeworksetupatthe granularity of a single individual for the future of the pandemic, poten- tially in the form of an endemic phase in which multiple vari- ants could coexist.

The model is highly flexible and includes many tunable parameters. The two variants can have dierent levels ofinfectiousnessandthevaccinemaynotprovideequalbenets against them. Specically, the vaccine protection against infec- tion,virustransmission,developmentofsymptomsandsevere, or lethal case of COVID-19 are parameters that can be set dif- ferently from one variant to the other. Moreover, we allow for a dierential capability to detect infected individuals between the twovariants.Thesefeaturesallowustostudytheeectsofmain characteristicsofanewCOVID-19variant:itsinfectiousness,re- sistanceagainstexistingvaccines,andabilitytoevadedetection.

To mimic the real residents of the town, agents were assigned to their living place, which can be a household, a retirement home, or, for inpatients, a hospital. Agents can go to school or work, depending on their age, and were thus assigned to work- places and school or college classes. Moreover, agents can visit time-o places, such as grocery stores or movie theaters. Some agentsworkinneighboringtownsandcities,andtheycommuted to work using carpools, public transit, or cycling. The statistical distributionofworkplacesandmeansusedtocommutewasob- tained from the U.S. Census Bureau.[62]In addition to time-o places, agents can visit each other in their households.

In addition, some susceptible agents expe- riencedCOVID-19likesymptomscausedbynon-COVID-19dis- eases; such instances may lead to false positives in testing and detection. Vaccine immunity was modeled through a reduction in the infection capability and a reduced severity of the symp- toms. COVID-19-like symptoms may lead to testing and home isolationofanotherwisehealthy,susceptibleagent. Once infected, the agents, vaccinated or otherwise, became exposed (E1,E2,EV 1,a n dEV 2).

For this reason, it wasassumedthatindividualshadalreadymadetheirchoiceson whethertotakethevaccineshotornotand,thosewhodecidedto vaccinate,werealreadyvaccinatedatthemomentofstartingthe simulations. Moreover, possible ongoing vaccination or booster campaigns that were implemented during the short-term sim- ulation time-horizon were omitted.

It wasalsoconsideredthatpartofthepopulationreceivedabooster shot. Similar to standard vaccines, the number of agents who received the booster was determined from the reported data at thecountylevel,[73]andthetimedistributionofboosteradminis- trationsmatchedtheactualtimedistributionoftheboostershot campaign.[74] Similar to a recent study on waning immunity,[35]vaccines did not grant full immunity and their protection waned with time. The exact modeling strategy of vaccine benets for the base variant was the same as described therein. However, the level of protection was reduced following the data reported for Omicron.[75,76] Giventheuncertaintysurroundingtheeectivenessofbooster shotsinpreventinginfectionwithOmicronandpotentialfuture variants,[76,77]two extreme outcomes were presented: a worst- casescenariowithineectiveboostershots,forwhichthebooster shot did not provide any additional immunity on top of the benets already gained with a standard two-shot vaccine; and a best-case scenario with highly eective booster shots, for which boostershotsrestoredmaximalbenetsandtheirresultingpro- tectiondidnotwaneforthetime-horizonofthesimulations.All detailsarereportedintheSupportingInformation.

There were no new vaccination doses nor booster shots dis- tributed to the agents during the simulation time frame. Fur- thermore,contrarytoapreviousstudy,[35]fullyvaccinatedagents wereassociallyactiveastheunvaccinatedpopulation.Thiswas motivated by the full restoration of and general pre-pandemiclevelsofmobilityandhumanactivity.Finally,vac- cinatedagentsdidnotneedtohomeisolatewhencontact-traced, whichreflectedtheCDCguidelinesissuedduringthesimulation window.[63] 2.3.TestingandContactTracing Atanypointoftheinfection,anagentcanbetestedforCOVID- 19 with a probability that depended on whether the agent was showingsymptomsofthedisease.AnagentshowingCOVID-19- like symptoms due to other illnesses can also undergo testing. Agents are home isolated from the moment they start waiting forthetesttothetimetheygettheirtestresults.Iftheresultsare positive, their isolation continue and if required, they may get furthertreatmentinahospital. Infected agents who are not symptomatic can receive a false negativetestresult.Inthiscase,theyleavetheirhomeisolation andcontinuetheirnormalactivitiesasiftheywerehealthy.The percentageoffalsenegativetestschangedacrossCOVID-19vari- ants.Forthecurrentstudyitwasconsideredtobe0.385%.This represented an average between false negative tests from two most common test types in the region, following estimates for theOmicronvariant.[78]Tomodeltheimpactofthenewvariant onthedetectioncapabilitiesofinfectedindividuals,aparameter termedtesting ecacy loss ,equaltotheprobabilityofaninfected agenttoreceiveafalsenegativetestresult,wasintroduced.Bydo- ingso,thepossibilitythattestkitsmayhaveareducedcapability todetectthenewvariantwasaccountedfor. The model also incorporated a form of contact tracing that followed the local guidelines.[63]When an agent receives a pos- itive COVID-19 test result, the agents with whom they were in recent social or professional contexts are contact-traced accord- ingtotherulesoutlinedinapreviouspublication.[35]Thedier- ence in the current model is that vaccinated and contact-traced agents are no longer required to be quarantined. Instead, they continuedtheirregularlifestyleswhilestayingvigilantforarec- ommendeddurationof15days.Thisimpliedthatiftheseagents developed COVID-19 symptoms, they will immediately be iso- latedandsignedupforatest.Ontheotherhand,agentsthatare notvaccinatedquarantinedfor5daysandremainedvigilantfor another10days. 2.4.SimulationSetup To approximate the epidemic situation in the town as of April 2022,thesimulationswereinitializedwiththreetypesofagents infected with the base variant: i) agents who were exposed, but undetected, and may develop disease symptoms; ii) agents who wereasymptomaticandpossiblydetectedandquarantined;and iii)agentswhohadsymptomsandwerebeinginvariousstagesoftestingandtreatment.Inaddition,partoftheagentswerecon- sideredtohaverecentlyrecoveredfromCOVID-19andcarrieda temporary natural immunity against the base variant.

Aftersomeinitialsimulations,whichspanneda1-yearperiod from mid-April was restored to pre-pandemic levels and no NPIs were in place. At the beginning of the simulations, some agents had illustrate our main simulation results. First, we study the long-term evolution of the disease by simulating the ABM over a period of 1 year. These simulations suggest that an en- demicphaseisextremelyhardtobeavoided.Afterward,wefocus on predicting the total number of infections over the 3-month simulation period and show that, under most realistic scenar- ios, on average almost every town resident becomes infected at leastonceduringthe3-monthperiod.Finally,weinvestigatethe spread of the two variants separately to shed light on how the characteristics of the new variant are conducive to its spread. Our ndings suggest that, in many cases, even less infectious variants could cause massive outbreak, but improved detection andvaccineecacymaybeeectiveincurbingthespreadofthe newvariant. 3.1.SimulationsPredicttheEmergenceofEndemicCOVID-19 In order to study the long-term evolution of multiple COVID- 19 strains, we simulate its spread for a Universiteitsbibliotheek, Wiley Online Library on [09/05/2023].

Toinvestigatetheimpactofsuchamodelingchoiceontheout- putofournumericalstudy,weperformadditionalsimulationsin which the duration of natural immunity is to an opti- misticestimateof240days,consistentwiththelongestestimate intheclinicalliterature.[80]Theresultsoftheseadditionalsimu- lations(reportedinFiguresS2andS3,SupportingInformation) areconsistentwiththendingsdescribedhereinandshowonly marginal dierences in the total infection count. This suggests that the duration of natural immunity has a secondary impact on the overall emergent behavior of the epidemic process: even under a very optimistic estimate of the duration of natural im- munity,anendemicdiseasecanhardlybeavoided. 4.DiscussionandConclusions Inthiswork,weestablishanovelhigh-resolutioncomputational therein toreproduceandstudytheconcurrentspreadoftwoCOVID-19 variants\u2014an initially widely spread variant and an emerg- ingnewvariant.Theframeworkcomplementstheexistingtool- boxtostudymulti-variantspreading,byoeringkeyadvantages thatareinherenttohigh-resolutionABMs.First,itprovidesthe abilitytosimulatethespreadofinfectiousdiseasesgivenhighly heterogeneous,andrealistic,humanlifestylesandmobility.Sec- ond, in resolving individual buildings, professions, and institu- tions of a real location, our framework opens opportunities for highlygranularstudiesofvariousaspectsofthepandemicsuch asinterventionsorvaccinationsintownswithsimilarlayouts. Wedemonstratethepotentialofourmodelingapproachbyap- plyingittothetownofNewRochelle,NY,whichwasthelocation ofoneoftherstCOVID-19outbreaksintheU.S.Weusedthe proposed model to study the spread of a hypothetical new vari- antofCOVID-19,concurrentlywiththeOmicronvariant,which is the dominant variant as of Spring 2022. The infectiousness anddetectioncharacteristicsofthenewvariantwereconsidered asthemodelparametersinaseriesofwhat-ifstudies,exploring vaccineandtestingecacyofthenewvariant. In our simulations, the number of infections with the Omi- cron (base) variant would always reach over half of the popula- tion.Weattributesuchadramaticlevelofinfectiontothereduced eectivenessofvaccinesagainstOmicron,aswellastothedocu- mentedwaningvaccinebenets.Whilethenumberofinfections with the Omicron variant might have been inflated, intensive spread was not unrealistic. The occurrence of Omicron causes a record spike in the detected cases in the region during win- ter 2021/2022 and rise of infections is also recorded during the periodofthestudy,amidstwaningvaccinebenets,restorednor- malcy,andthepresenceofevenmoreinfectioussubvariants.[74]The introduction of the new variant causes a visible increase in thecasecount,withthetwovariantsinteractingwitheachother. Whenthenewvariantisequallyormoreinfectiousthanthebase variant, even high detection rates and eective vaccines against thenewvariantfailsinreducingthetotalnumberofinfections. Interestingly, such a dramatic increase is often observed also in thescenariooflessinfectiousvariants.Thiscouldhavebeenan- ticipated,giventhewaningimmunityofthevaccineagainstthe basevariantandtheincompleteadoptionofboostershots. Finally, we identify conditions under which the spread of the newvariantcouldbecurbed.Specically,iftheriskofinfection ofthenewvariantislowerthanthebasevariant,thecombination ofsucientlyeectivetestingandvaccinesagainstthenewvari- ant may reduce a new, potential wave. In fact, if protection loss were 40-50% or less, and the false negativity rate would below 50%, only a tenth of the residents would become infected with thenewvariant.Thisnumbercouldbefurtherabated,ifthevac- cine were almost as ecacious against the new variant as it is towardthebasevariantandthetestinganddetectioninfrastruc- turearehighlyecacious. The results of our numerical simulations are in line with the trends reported in the literature. Signicant case-rise asso- ciated with emergence of new variants were observed by many studies to date, given the fully reopened economy and heav- ily relaxed quarantining regulations.[52,57,59,60]Arruda et al. per- formed numerical simulations using a compartmental model, reportingdoublingcasecountsandoccurrencesofnewinfection surges due to the emergence of new variants amidst lifting or absenceofrestrictions.[52]Usingacomputationalmodel,Layton and Sandria showed that a new variant that andstrainthehealthcareinfrastructure.[57]Similarly,throughnu- mericalsimulationsofOmicronasanewvariant,Gonzalezand Arenasreportedemergingsurgesofinfectionsforawiderangeof hypotheticalinfectivitiesandvaccineresistancecombinations.[60] Withrespecttovaccineecacy,severalstudiesusedcompart- mentalmodelstosupportthatincreasingvaccineecacywould beacriticalfactorincurbingthespreadofthenewvariant.[55-58] This is results from the scenario where thenewvariantislessinfectiousthanthebaseone.Ontheother hand,someauthorspointedouttheinabilityofvaccinestocurb thespreadofthenewvariantundertheconditionsofwaningim- munityandwithitssucientinfectiousness.[59,60]Prominently, Gonzalez and Arenas showed that if a new variant is equally or more infectious than the base one, increasing vaccine eective- nesshasalmostnoeectonthenalcasecount.[60]Thesend- ings are in line to what we reported for equivalent infectious- nessscenarios. While insightful and consistent with similar eorts, our re- sults should be interpreted while keeping in mind several limi- tationsofthemodel.First,followingCDCrecommendations,[63] we set the duration of immunity after recovery to 90 days. This estimate may be conservative, inevitably leading to several re- infections. Although not conclusive for Omicron, there are ob- servations of immunity lasting two or even three times our estimate.[81,82]However, as shown in the Universiteitsbibliotheek, Wiley Online Library on [09/05/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advtheorysimul.com The second limitation concerns the limited amount of infor- mation about and the high levels of uncertainty on the ecacy of booster shots against variants and the rate at which the im- munitywanesaftertakingtheboostershot.[75,76,83]Inourstudy, we partially address this issue by considering two extreme out- comesfortheboostershot:aworst-casescenario,wherebooster shotsdonotprovideanybenets,andabest-casescenariowhere, instead,theyrestoremaximalandpermanentimmunity.Impor- tantly,weobservethattheresultsofoursimulationsremaincon- sistentacrossthesetwoextremeoptions,withboostershotplay- ing a marginal role on the case count. As of July 2022, novel Omicron-adaptedboostershotsarebeingdevelopedbydierent manufacturers.[84,85]Theuseoftheseboostershots,ifecacious, may steer the course of the pandemic. We would like to com- mentthat,eventhoughtheseboostershotsarenotcurrentlycon- sideredinourmodel,theflexibilityofourcomputationalframe- workallowsfortheirstraightforwardimplementation,similarto vaccinationandboostercampaignsincorporatedinourprevious studies.[35] Finally, our model does not consider cross-immunity, that i s ,r e c o v e r yf r o ma ni n f e c t i o nw i t ho n ev a r i a n td o e sn o t yield any natural protection against the other variant. Lack of cross-immunity is not an uncommon assumption in the literature,[41,42,51,52,55,56,58]asitcanbeviewedasaworst-case,con- servativescenario,whichis,however,nottoodistantfromwhat issuspectedwiththemostrecentvariants.[86-88] Despiteitsshortcomings,thehighgranularityofourABMand its faithful representation of the town and its population are key vantage points. Our framework simulates characteristics, lifestyles, and mobility patterns of every individual in the com- munity. It introduces concrete locations, where people interact andthediseasespreads,andallowsforstudyingtheepidemicina highlyresolved,heterogeneoussetting,whichisabsentfromthe above mentionedpopulation-based approaches. The framework modelscontactsbetweenindividuals,but,dierentfromnetwork models, it also provides interaction details. The key elements ofourframework\u2014realisticvaccinations,variant-dependenttest- ing, and COVID-19 oriented treatment\u2014yield the opportunity for studying the co-evolution of two variants, allocation of re- sources,andformulationofstrategiesintimesofcrisis,suchas themostrecentOmicronone.[6] We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework by model- ing the interplay of two COVID-19 variants, along with the ef- fect of waning vaccine immunity and reduced detection on the course of the pandemic. The prediction of aggressive spread of bothvariantsinapracticallynotimmunepopulation,intheab- senceofNPIs,warrantscautionandreconsiderationofreinstat- ingatleastsomeprotectivemeasures.Distributingfurtherdoses of vaccine should also be contemplated, as well as developing new vaccines, more eective against the new variants. Finally, our results indicate that the gures of a new wave of infections causedbyanemergingvariantcanbegreatlyreducedifthevari- antislessinfectious,whilethetestsandvaccinesareonlymod- eratelylessecacious.Whilenotunexpected,theseconclusions provide a quantitativelygrounded starting point for future stud- ies and \"what-if\" scenarios A.T. and M.P. was partially supported by National Science Foundation (CMMI-2027990).
