However, it should not be overlooked, as a severe cold can lead to serious complications, resulting in hospitalization or death in vulnerable patients. The treatment of the common cold remains purely symptomatic. Analgesics as well as oral antihistamines or decongestants may be advised to relieve fever, and local treatments can clear the airways and relieve nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, or sneezing. Certain medicinal plant specialties can be used as therapy or as complementary self-treatment. Recent scientific advances discussed in more detail in this review have demonstrated the plant's efficiency in the treatment of the common cold. This review presents an overview of plants used worldwide in the treatment of cold diseases.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-04-28", "cleaned_text": "Natural Products for the Prevention and Treatment of Common Cold and Viral Respiratory Infections [https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16050662](https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16050662) [Antiviral Compounds is not a single cause for the illness; rather, it is a heterogeneous group of diseases caused by numerous viruses that belong to several different families. Occasionally, the common cold may spread to the lower respiratory tract, as well as predispose to bacterial complications [ [2](#B2-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [3](#B3-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [4](#B4-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [5](#B5-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. [3](#B3-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [7](#B7-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Altogether, the condition associated with more than 200 virus subtypes [ [8](#B8-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. The common colds are distinctly different entities than rhinitis or pharyngitis, as well as influenza (flu). Colds are very common, especially in children [ [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. The prevalence of common cold or viral acute rhinosinusitis (VAR) in the general population varies depending on different studies. Although VAR is a common problem, the precise incidence is difficult to estimate, and is often concluded as very high. It has been estimated that adults suffer two to five episodes of viral VAR (or colds) per year and school children may suffer seven to ten colds per year. Post-viral and bacterial VAR is less common. Approximately 0.5-2% of viral upper respiratory tract infections are complicated by bacterial infection [ [10](#B10-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [11](#B11-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. [12](#B12-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Antibiotics only fight bacteria [ [2](#B2-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Recommended therapy (allopathy) is mainly symptomatic: a combination of paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\u2014NSAIDs (reduce fever and soreness of the throat, and might also have some beneficial effect on cough), second-generation antihistamines with short-term benefit in reducing symptoms the first 2 days (reduce sneezing and rhinorrhea), nasal decongestants with small effect in nasal nasal blockage), ipratropium bromide (reduce rhinorrhea), probiotics, zinc when administered the first 24 h after the onset of symptoms, nasal saline irrigations, vitamin C (in selected patients with a suspected deficit or with high levels of physical activity), and some herbal medicines ( [Table 1](#pharmaceuticals-16-00662-t001)) [ [3](#B3-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [10](#B10-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [11](#B11-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Frequent changes in the serotypes of the virus lead to changes in the viral antigenic structure which annually imposes the development of new vaccines, in particular, because of the emergence of the newly virulent viral strains. The time required for vaccine development has an impact on the hospitalization and mortality of vulnerable patients [ [13](#B13-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. [14](#B14-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Several medicinal plants are commonly used as medicines to relieve the symptoms of upper tract respiratory infections such as relieving cough, reducing fever, and clearing the nose. Moreover, the treatment of colds depends mainly on compounds that are isolated from plants such as polyphenols, flavonoids, saponins, and alkaloids [ [15](#B15-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Different indicated diverse herbs' efficiency, for example, Hedera helix L. (H. helix) [ Thymus vulgaris L. (P. sidoides) [ [20](#B20-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)] for the treatment of common colds. However, the combination of several herbs such as H. helix/Primula veris L. (P. veris)/T. vulgaris) purpurea L. (E. purpurea) [ [24](#B24-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)] are approved in several countries as medicinal products recommended for treatment of cold symptoms. This review presents an overview of the main herbs used as a treatment for common colds worldwide. [25](#B25-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. |Plant a||Plant Main constituents by Nagy et al. [ [26](#B26-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. 2. Possible Mechanism of Action of Phytochemicals for Colds [26](#B26-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. The degradation products effect. The flavonoids [ [28](#B28-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)] involve the inhibition of the synthesis of pro-inflammatory mediators such as eicosanoids, cytokines, histamine, factor- interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, transcription such as nuclear (NF-B), activating protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor (Nrf2), nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity, too [ [28](#B28-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. The same activity has been cited for phenylethanoids (as verbascoside) [ [29](#B29-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. The oligomeric proanthocyanidins [ [30](#B30-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)] have an effect on the formalin-induced paw edema model of inflammation in rats, as well as are inhibitors of PLA2, COX-1, COX-2, 5-LOX, decreased, through the inhibition nitric oxide (NO) production and the suppression of NF-B pathway activation. Proanthocyanidins also have anti-oxidant activities (with flavonoids) [ [30](#B30-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. In addition, the natural compounds coumarins [ [31](#B31-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)] are considered as an antioxidants. They have also an inhibitory effect on COX-1, 5-LOX, NF-B, TNF-, and NO production. The anti-inflammatory effects the the inhibition of COX-1 COX-2, the production of cytokines, PGE2, LTB4, TBX2, and IFN-. These effects cytokines, e.g., TNF-, IL-1, IL-2, and IL-6 [ significant increase in neutrophils, monocytes, and leukocytes (immunostimulatory/immunomodulatory effect). The anti-inflammatory effect may be attributed to the inhibition of COX-1 and to a lesser extent of COX-2 by alkamides [ [33](#B33-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [34](#B34-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Additionally, it inhibited the production of NO and the fibroblast-induced collagen concentration/level. Alkamides also inhibit NF-B, described as stimulating the expression of some mediators of inflammation, cytokines, e.g., TNF-, IL-2, and both cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2). The activation of the former plays a considerable role in controlling anxiety, and the latter is mainly involved in immune system activities ( [Figure 1](#pharmaceuticals-16-00662-f001)A,B). [36](#B36-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Salicylic acid has recognized antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties [ [36](#B36-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Constituents of effect. This effect is explained by the inhibition of both NF-B and by increasing the production of NO and PGE2; ferulic acid inhibits TNF, and chlorogenic reduce the viscosity of tenacious secretions by irritating the gastric vagal receptors that stimulate respiratory tract fluid, thus increasing the volume but decreasing the viscosity of respiratory tract they a effect. marrubenol (the substance of bitter taste receptors\u2014T2Rs) inhibits bronchoconstriction by blocking L-type calcium channels [ [42](#B42-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Triterpenic saponins (as hederacoside C B, -hederin, -hederin, respectively; glycyrrhizine) [ [43](#B43-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)] have 2-sympathomimetic secretion of pulmonary surfactant in lung alveolar type II cells, which could explain their secretolytic activity. Simultaneously, the level of intracellular calcium is decreased, which raises bronchodilatation ( [Figure 1](#pharmaceuticals-16-00662-f001)B). [26](#B26-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. It inhibits the cough reflex suppressing the response of the cough center, via the demulcent effect of afferent vagus nerves. The blockade of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) by mucilage represents a therapy for the treatment of dry cough. The TRPA1 agonists with ( [Figure 1](#pharmaceuticals-16-00662-f001)A,B). [44](#B44-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)] were tested for their antiviral activity against the respiratory syncytial virus. Phenolic compounds such as caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and chlorogenic acid as [ [46](#B46-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)] apigenin; have anti-adenoviral activity ( [Figure 1](#pharmaceuticals-16-00662-f001)B). 3. Most Commonly Used Medicinal Plants for the Treatment of the Common Colds [Table 2](#pharmaceuticals-16-00662-t002)and [Table 3](#pharmaceuticals-16-00662-t003)). 3.1. Allium sativum L. [48](#B48-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Garlic is considered an antimicrobial and antiviral product that could relieve common cold viruses such as the human rhinovirus. A bibliometric study was performed to determine the effect of A. sativum on either the prevention or treatment of the common cold. However, data are limited to one clinical trial. The trial reported 24 occurrences of the common cold in the garlic intervention group (allicin content) compared with 65 in the placebo group (p < 0.001), resulting in fewer days of illness in the garlic group compared with the placebo group (111 versus 366). The authors of the clinical trial suggest that using garlic as a supplement to allicin can prevent the onset of common cold infections. However, the clinical data published in the bibliometric study were insufficient to validate the effect of garlic in the prevention or treatment of the common cold [ [49](#B49-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [50](#B50-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. 3.2. Echinacea The immunological effects of echinacea have been investigated extensively in vitro and in vivo. Echinacea products are made from the roots, the whole plant, or aerial parts of Echinacea angustifolia (E. vitro experiments with human macrophages found that fresh-pressed juice and dried juice from the aerial parts of E. purpurea stimulated the production of cytokines including IL-1, IL-10, and TNF- [ [54](#B54-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. In addition, evidence pointed out the effective activity of E. purpurea towards Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in an organotypic cell culture model [ [55](#B55-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [56](#B56-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [57](#B57-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. [58](#B58-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. In addition, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 282 subjects aged 18-65 years with a history of 2 or more colds in the previous year were recruited to evaluate the benefits of the treatment against cold symptoms. Among people who developed a cold, a significant decrease in symptoms was observed in the group that was under Echinacea treatment compared to the placebo group [ [59](#B59-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. These findings confirmed the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial realized on 80 volunteers who had experienced the first symptoms of a cold. After a period of treatment with E. purpurea herb, this plant remains clinically efficient to relieve symptoms faster than a placebo [ [60](#B60-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. However, Echinacea therapy represents an effective alternative to standard symptomatic medications in the acute treatment of the common cold [ [61](#B61-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. 3.3. Eucalyptus globulus Labill. [62](#B62-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. [63](#B63-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [64](#B64-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [65](#B65-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. In addition, a recent study was able to determine that a formula containing hyaluronic acids, Eucalyptus oil, copper, and manganese salts is effective for safe nasal irrigation and therefore for alleviating symptoms associated with the common cold such as nasal congestion [ [66](#B66-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Additionally, the Eucalyptus plant is often used as a compound in an ointment containing camphor, menthol, and Eucalyptus oils for topical application, which lessens the symptoms of colds [ [67](#B67-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [68](#B68-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. A meta-analysis published in 2022 was able to synthesize the clinical trials that demonstrate the effectiveness of Eucalyptus in relieving cough. However, six studies have been published. Four randomized controlled trials have shown that Eucalyptus globulus Labill. (E. globulus) used in a formula significantly reduces cough compared to the placebo group. This study supports the idea of using the medicinal plant Eucalyptus as a remedy for cold symptoms primarily for cough and runny nose [ it has been shown that Grindelia squarrosa (G. squarrosa) has an anti-inflammatory such as IL-8, TNF-, and IL-6 in culture cells such as macrophage, neutrophil, and respiratory epithelial cell line [ [70](#B70-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [71](#B71-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. The researchers suggest that the anti-cold activity of Grindelia comes down to the composition of the medicinal plant formula used, and that G. squarrosa could have an essential effect on the treatment of inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract [ [70](#B70-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [71](#B71-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Moreover, G. robusta has been demonstrated to be effective as an expectorant, antitussive, and anti-inflammatory remedy in children, but no clinical trial has confirmed its efficiency [ [72](#B72-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. 3.5. anti-inflammatory activities of M. \u00d7 piperita leaves have been investigated in the case of respiratory infection. In the in vitro model, M. piperita decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-, IL-6, and PGE2, and has antiviral activity against [83](#B83-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. EMA announced in its report related to this plant that the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products stated that it can be used as a remedy for the symptoms of the common cold, but no clinical trial has been published to date [ [84](#B84-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. 3.8. Pelargonium sidoides DC, Pelargonium reniforme Curt [85](#B85-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. A number of studies highlighted the activity of the proanthocyanidin-rich extract EPs 7630 from the roots of P. sidoides. It is considered effective against a variety of respiratory viruses such as HCoV (HCo-229E), influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza virus by limiting the symptom severity and disease duration of these infections [ [86](#B86-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [87](#B87-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. [86](#B86-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Another clinical trial has evaluated the efficacy of EPs 7630, compared with the placebo for the treatment of the common cold. Of 207 patient participants, 103 were included in the standard dose of EPs 7630 (received 3 \u00d7 30 drops per day), 104 participated in the high dose group (received treatment with 3 \u00d7 60 drops per day), and the control group received a placebo. The study was conducted over a period of 10 days. The active EPs 7630 is an effective, well-tolerated, and safe treatment for the common cold. It significantly reduced the severity of symptoms [ [88](#B88-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. The effectiveness of the extract roots of P. sidoides was also evaluated and confirmed by Lizogub [ [89](#B89-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)] and Ross [ [90](#B90-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. 3.9. Pimpinella anisum L. [91](#B91-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. This evidence could be reinforced by the study of Iannarelli et al. [ [92](#B92-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. The authors of this study evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity and the effect on mucin secretion of P. anisum essential oil in primary airway bronchial and tracheal epithelial cells (HBEpC and HTEpC, respectively). The data indicated that P. anisum essential oil showed a significant anti-inflammatory effect on both HBEpC and HTEpC cells together with mucus hypersecretion, which indicates that P. anisum could be used as an expectorant during cold periods [ [92](#B92-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]; however, on the other hand, there is no published clinical trial which confirms the expectorant effect of this plant. 3.10. Primula elatior (L.) Hill, Primula veris L. [93](#B93-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), main constituents in flowers are triterpenic saponins, which are predominantly present in the sepals (up to 2%); flavonoids, which are predominantly present in the petals (up to 3%); carotenoids; essential oil (trace saccharide alcohols [ [95](#B95-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Roots may be whole or cut and dried [ [96](#B96-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. The main constituents in roots The roots may be used as a herbal substance for the production of herbal preparations: dry extract (prepared with 40-50% ethanol), liquid extract (prepared with 70% ethanol), tincture (prepared with 70% ethanol), soft extract (prepared with water; 20-55% ethanol; 50% methanol; or a mixture of methanol, water, and ammonia), and comminuted herbal substance [ [93](#B93-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. [95](#B95-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. There are no clinical trials published in which only Primula flower or root preparation are used in the treatment group. However, combinations with thyme preparations show effectiveness on cough in clinical trials [ [97](#B97-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. 3.11. Sambucus nigra L. [98](#B98-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. [99](#B99-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Flavonoid content up to 3%. Other important compounds are triterpenes essential oil, 3% caffeic acid derivatives, 0.11% sterols, seeds contain hemagglutinin (lectins, e.g., nigra agglutinin III), while S. nigra agglutinin Vf lectin is present in fresh fruits. Other constituents are essential oil (trace amounts), vitamins, minerals, and saccharides [ [102](#B102-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. The seeds of the unripe sambunigrin, prunasin, [ [103](#B103-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Other traditional uses of elderberry fruit preparations are as a laxative, diaphoretic, diuretic, analgesic, and sedative, to alleviate headache, dental, heart, nerve pain and neuralgia, and against cough and cold, to name a few [ [102](#B102-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. However, the EMA monograph on elderberry fruit is not scardica Griseb (S. scardica) has been used in traditional medicine as a remedy for improving symptoms during respiratory infections such as bronchitis and bronchial asthma. Additionally, this plant is known for its effectiveness against colds and coughs [ [105](#B105-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [106](#B106-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)], but there is no published clinical trial which confirms these effects. 3.13. Thymus lists 10 chemotypes, underlying the chemical diversity of this plant [ [107](#B107-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. [109](#B109-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Flavonoids from thyme do not seem to pharmacological potential [ [109](#B109-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. [109](#B109-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [111](#B111-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [113](#B113-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. The anti-microbial properties are used in mouth, gastrointestinal, and urinary tract infections, as well as respiratory diseases (cough, bronchitis, asthma). The most important medicinal use relies that the use of thymol in combination with an antibiotic may lead to reduced antibiotic concentration in therapeutic use against planktonic and biofilm-forming bacteria [ [17](#B17-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. [17](#B17-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. [118](#B118-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)] described a relaxant effect on the tracheal chain on guinea pigs as efficient as theophylline, and Wienkotter et al. [ [119](#B119-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)] described a 2 agonist activity (molecular binding and biological effects), suggesting an interesting therapeutic activity at both symptomatic and viral levels in the case of upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold and flu. Additional anti-inflammatory activities lead Thymus sp. to have strong potential in upper respiratory tract viral infections. Patil et al. [ [111](#B111-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)] reported an inhibition of the 5-lipooxygenase at a low concentration of thyme essential oil (IC50 at 0.005 \u00b5g/mL), suggesting the latter could reduce leukotrienes synthesis during inflammation. [120](#B120-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)] also showed antiviral activity of thyme extract (in a commercial preparation, where the active compound is thymol according to the authors) against the human rhinovirus 1a (HRV1a, MDCK/A549 cells, MOI 1). [22](#B22-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)] published a clinical trial (doubled blind, placebo controlled, multicenter, with 363 patients including 182 with herbal treatment and 181 in the placebo group) which showed the efficacy and tolerability of a fluid extract of thyme herb (mixed with Ivy) on acute bronchitis. The herbal treatment significantly reduced cough compared to placebo (77.6% vs. 55.9%; p < 0.0001) after 9 days and reduced the severity of bronchitis (evaluated with BSS score). The authors also reported the superiority of the herbal treatment on sleep disturbance, and general well-being. They also reported that adverse effects were low and similar to those in the placebo group (3.8% and 4.5% respectively). All adverse effects had been resolved at the end of the study and the authors concluded the very good tolerability of the treatment [ [22](#B22-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. [121](#B121-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [122](#B122-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. [https://clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov)(accessed on 21 September 2022) and Silva et al. (2021), two clinical studies are still undergoing so as to better evaluate thyme, thyme extracts, or essential oils in upper respiratory tracts [ It is known to relieve respiratory system ailments such as hoarseness, tonsillitis, colds, coughs, asthma, or bronchitis, and this data are supported by EMA and Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products [ [127](#B127-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [128](#B128-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. [129](#B129-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)] and by its antiviral activity against the H1N1 infection in a mouse model [ [130](#B130-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. 4. Medicinal Plants without EMA Monography with Potential Effects on Common Cold 4.1. Aloe qrborescens Mill. [135](#B135-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [136](#B136-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. A. arborescens extract mixed with Vitamin C (1920 mg of the extract and 51 mg Vitamin C per 5 mL) \"Biaron C\u00ae\" has been tested against a panel of viruses that cause upper respiratory infections [ [137](#B137-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Human rhinovirus B (HRV14), influenza A virus (H1N1) and (H3N2), influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus (Para 3), coxsackievirus (CA9), adenovirus C (Adeno 5) were cultivated in specific cells (such as MDCK, Hep-2, and HeLa-cells), and were treated by Biaron C\u00ae at 2-0.006% of final concentration. Data demonstrated that the Biaron C\u00ae was effective against the RNA viruses tested. The antiviral activity was more selective against Picornaviridae and Orthomyxoviridae. This confirms its known therapeutic antiviral effect [ [137](#B137-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. 4.2. Boehmeria Kucha [139](#B139-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. The results of this study show that the ingestion of two capsules containing C. sinensis daily decreased by about a third the number of subjects who presented cold and flu symptoms. In addition to its effect on the incidence of cold and flu symptoms, C. sinensis ingestion enhanced the production of IFN- by / T cells challenged in vitro [ 4.4. Cistus \u00d7 incanus. L. [141](#B141-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [142](#B142-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. [143](#B143-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. the case of the latter infections, a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study was performed to evaluate the effect of a Cistus extract (CYSTUS052) in a total of 160 patients by comparing symptoms and by dosing inflammatory markers in either group: CYSTUS052 treatment and placebo. However, common cold symptoms and C-reactive protein were significantly reduced in CYSTUS052 treated group compared to the placebo group [ [144](#B144-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. In addition, the antiviral activity of this extract (CYSTUS052) was determined in vitro and in vivo against the influenza A virus. Droebner et al. showed a major ( 90%) reduction in plaque numbers in CYSTUS052 pretreated cells in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, as well as the absence of common cold symptoms in vivo in influenza A virus-infected mice treated with CYSTUS052 [ [145](#B145-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Ehrhardt et al. demonstrated the anti-influenza effect of plant extract CYSTUS052 in vitro on H5N1 infected adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549) or MDCK cells. The effective dose of Cistus extract plant was 50 g/mL [ [146](#B146-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. arabinogalactan seems to be implicated specifically in the activation of immune cells as well as the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines during common cold diseases [ [149](#B149-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. This scientific evidence could be confirmed by a clinical trial that enrolled a total of 199 healthy participants who had common cold infections in the last 6 months. A group of 101 participants were given Larch arabinogalactan (4.5 g) compared to the placebo group (98 participants). Subsequently, the results revealed that Larch arabinogalactan decreased significantly the incidence of common cold infections and reduced the number of seasonal common cold episodes [ [150](#B150-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Larch arabinogalactan seems to be implicated specifically in the activation of immune cells as well as the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines during common cold diseases [ [149](#B149-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. 4.7. Paeonia lactiflora Pall. [151](#B151-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. In addition, the antiviral activity of P. lactiflora was also evaluated against both HRSV-2 and HRSV-4 in MRC5 cells. Treatment of infected cells by 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-- d-glucopyranose (PGG) P. lactiflora root extract induced HRV-2 (17.89 M) and HRV-4 (17.33 M) in MRC5 cells by interfering with the entry of the viruses into the cells and by decreasing rhinovirus receptors and inflammatory immune response mediators [ [152](#B152-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. 5. Herbal Combinations Useful for Treating the Common Cold 5.1. Hedera helix/Primula vulgaris/Thymus vulgaris [118](#B118-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)], and a double-blind, randomized study identified the efficacy and tolerability of ivy leaves for the treatment of acute bronchitis with improving symptoms: cough, sputum, rales/rhonchi, and chest pain during coughing and dyspnea [ [153](#B153-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. A combination of thyme and ivy leaves has been studied in the case of acute bronchitis with productive cough [ [21](#B21-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [22](#B22-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. The efficacy of combination of thyme and ivy treatment was evaluated by a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase IV study performed on 361 outpatients with acute bronchitis and coughing fits. Coughing fits intensity and the symptoms of acute bronchitis improved rapidly in the group under the thyme-ivy combination [ [22](#B22-pharmaceuticals-16-00662), [119](#B119-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Metanalysis demonstrated that different herbal mixtures are effective against the common cold such as vy/primrose/thyme, essential oils GeloMyrtol\u00ae, and Tsumura bakumondoto ( [Table S1](#app1-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)) [23](#B23-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. This study highlighted that the combination of ivy/primrose/thyme has been effective to reduce coughing. Furthermore, RCT demonstrated also the effectiveness of GeloMyrtol\u00ae and Tsumura bakumondoto [23](#B23-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. 5.2. Tsumura Bakumondoto [154](#B154-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. effect of bakumondoto on the intensity of the patient's coughs was significantly stronger on days 4 and 5 of intake. No serious adverse events were reported [ [154](#B154-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. 5.3. GeloMyrtol\u00ae (Myrtol\u00ae) [Table S1](#app1-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)). Myrtol\u00ae 300 mg was as treatment in a double-blind, parallel-group enrolling about 413 patients with bronchitis. The patients responded positively to this treatment with an improvement in their clinical state of health [ [155](#B155-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Myrtol\u00ae was also confirmed to be effective against acute bronchitis. A study by Mattys et al. studied the effectiveness of the myrtol stand on 676 patients with acute bronchitis. The responder rate was significantly higher in the myrtol stand group and superior in terms of efficacy compared to other tested treatments and placebo; it is even considered as an alternative to antibiotics for acute bronchitis treatment [ [156](#B156-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. 5.4. Soshiho-Tang [Table S1](#app1-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)). According to the meta-analysis of Jung et al. [ [157](#B157-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)], Soshiho-tang is mainly used in the treatment of pediatric cough, nasal congestion, and runny nose, and because of the herbs that compose it, there could be an anti-inflammatory effect [ [157](#B157-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. A recent review suggests that Soshiho-tang could be used in the treatment of COVID-19 symptoms [ [158](#B158-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. 5.5. Kang Jang\u00ae [Table S1](#app1-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)) including harms root used in Scandinavia for the treatment of respiratory tract diseases [ [159](#B159-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Bath et al. facilitated a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of Kang Jang\u00ae as an antitussive remedy. Among 177 patients enrolled in the parallel-group, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, the group which had undertaken Kang Jan (30 mL/day; 762 mg genuine extracts with standardized contents of 0.2 mg/mL vasicine, 0.8 mg/mL chicoric acid, and 0.03 mg/mL eleutherosides B and E) showed a faster symptom improvement compared to other groups (placebo and bromhexine) [ [159](#B159-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. 5.6. So-Cheong-Ryong-Tang and Yeon-Gyo-Pae-Dok-San [Table S1](#app1-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)), So-cheong-ryong-tang and Yeon-gyo-pae-dok-san in the treatment of the common cold [ [160](#B160-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. In this study, 480 patients who presented symptoms of the common cold within 48 h were recruited. The clinical trial was double blinded, and So-cheong-ryong-tang and Yeon-gyo-pae-dok-san were administrated separately in parallel groups orally 3 times per day. Evaluation of symptoms after mix herbal intake showed that each of the herbal blends used resulted in their improvement [ [160](#B160-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. 5.7. Combination of Echinaceae radix, Baptisiae radix, Thujae herba [24](#B24-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. The results showed that more than half of the patients taking the herbal combination responded positively to the treatment compared to patients taking a placebo. The therapeutic benefit of the herbal remedy appeared on day 2 and reached significance on day 4, continuing until the end of treatment while following the evolution of the symptoms of bronchitis and rhinitis [ [24](#B24-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. The efficacy of this herbal medication in common cold treatment was also demonstrated by Naser et al. [ [161](#B161-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. The authors evaluated in their clinical trial the effect of the mixture of Echinaceae radix, Baptisiae radix, and Thujae herba on runny nose symptoms. A total of 60 patients suffering from the common cold were treated with the mixture (19.2 mg and 9.6 mg) versus 31 patients who received a placebo, three times daily for 3-12 days. Test evaluation of common cold symptoms showed that the two groups that took the two doses (high and low) of the herbal mixture responded well to the treatment compared to the placebo [ [161](#B161-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. Thus, both studies showed that this herbal remedy is effective and safe in common cold treatment. 5.8. Ma-Xing-Shi-Gan-Tang [Table S1](#app1-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)) used for the treatment of the common cold, fever, and influenza virus infections. The antiviral activity of nontoxic concentrations of Ma-xing-shi-gan-tang against influenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1) was examined in MDCK cells. Ma-xing-shi-gan-tang exhibited activity with EC50 \u00b1 0.41 mg/mL against influenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1). In addition, this combination of medicinal herbs appeared to have an inhibitory effect on the synthesis of both viral RNA and proteins in treating cells. These data supported that Ma-xing-shi-gan-tang could be used in the treatment of influenza virus infections [ [162](#B162-pharmaceuticals-16-00662)]. 6.
