CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 6/23/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 1 Table of Contents Infectious Dose - How much agent will make a healthy individual ill? ..................................................................................... 3 The human infectious dose of severe acute r espiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. SARS -CoV-2 is the cause of coronavi rus disease 19 (COVID -19). Studies from other animal models are used as surrogates for humans. Identifying the infectious dose for humans by the various routes through which we become infected is critical to the effective development of computational models to predict risk, develop diagnostics and countermeasures, and effective decontamination strategies. Anima l studies are a plausible surrogate. Transmissibility - How does it spread from one host to another? How easily is it spread? ...................................................... 4 SARS- CoV-2 is passed easily between humans, likely through close contact with relatively large droplets and possibly through smaller aerosolized particles. Individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to others before they have symptoms. Undetected cases play a major role in transmission, a nd most cases are not reported. Individuals who have recovered clinically, but test positive, appear unable to transmit COVID -19. Uncerta inty surrounds the contribution of contaminated surfaces (fomites) as well as aerosol transmission to overall COVID - 19 prevalence. Host Range - How many species does it infect? Can it transfer from species to species? ......................................................... 5 SARS- CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before in fecting humans, but the ide ntity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown. SARS- CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2002/2003. To date, ferrets, mink, hamst ers, cats, and primates have been shown to be susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection. It is unknown whether these animals can transmit infection to humans. Several animal models have been developed to recreate human -like illnes s, though to date they have been infected with high dose exposures. Lower dose studies may better replicate human disease acquisition. Incubation Period - How long after infection do symptoms appear? Are people infectious du ring this time? .......................... 6 The majority of individuals develop symptoms within 14 days of exposure. For most people, it takes at least 2 days to develop symptoms, and on average symptoms develop 5 days af ter exposure. Incubating individuals can transmit disease for several days before symptom onset. Some individuals never develop symptoms but can still transmit disease. The incubation period is well -characterized. Patients m ay be infectious, however, for days before symptoms develop. Clinical Presentation - What are the signs and symptoms of an infected person? ................................................................... 7 Many COVID -19 cases a re asymptomatic. Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group.5 Older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death. The case fa tality rate varies substantially by patient age and underlying comorbidities. Additional studies on vulnerable subpopulations are required. Children are susceptible to COVID -19,131 though gene rally show milder87, 285 or no symptoms. The true case fa tality rate is unknown, as the exact number of cases is uncertain. Testing priorities and case definitions vary by location. The proportion of asymptomatic infections is not known. Protective Immunity - How long does the imm une response provide protection from reinfection? ........................................ 8 Infected patients show productive immune responses, however more data is needed. Currently, there is no evidence that recovered patients can be reinfected with SARS -CoV-2. As the pandemic continues, long -term monitoring of immune activity and reinfection status is needed. Clinical Diagnosis - Are there tools to diagnose infected individuals? When during infection are they effective? .................... 9 Diagnosis relies on identifying the genetic signature of the virus in patient nose, throat, or sputum samples. These tests are relatively accurate. Confirmed ca ses are still underreported. Validated serological (antibody) assays are being develo ped to help determine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2. Serological evidence of exposure does not indicate immunity. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 6/23/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 2 In general, PCR tests appear to be sensitive and specific, though confirmation of symptoms via chest CT i s recommended. The sensitivity and specificity of serological testing methods is variable, and additional work needs to be done to determin e factors that affect test accuracy. Medical Treatments - Are there effective treatme nts?...........................................................................................................10 Treatmen t for COVID -19 is primarily supportive care including ventilation if necessary.177, 299 Numerous clinical trials are ongoing. Several drugs show efficacy. Remdesivir shows promise for reducing symptom duration in humans.37 Hydroxychloroquine is associated with elevated risk of cardiac arrhythmias and provides limited to no clinical benefit at thi s point in time. Large, randomized clinical trial results are necessary. Dexamethasone may significantly reduce mortality in severely ill and ventilated patients. Other pharmaceutical interventions are being investi gated. Additional information on treatment efficacy is required, particularly from large randomized clinical trials. Vaccines - Are there effective vaccines? ................................................................................................................................. 11 Work is ongoing to develop a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine in human and animal trials. Early results are being released, but evidence should be considered preliminary until larger trials are completed. Published results from randomized clinical trials (Phase I - III) are needed. Non- pharmaceutical Interventions - Are public health control measures effective at reducing spread? ................................. 12 Broad -scale control measures such as stay -at-home orders are effective at reducing movement and contact rates, and modeling shows evidence that they reduce transmission. Research is needed to help plan for eas ing of restrictions. As different US states have implemented differing control measures at various times, a comprehensive analysis of social distancing efficacy has not yet been conducted. Environmental Stability - How long does the agent live in the environment? .........................................................................13 SARS- CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for at least 3 days and on the surface of a surgical mask for up to 7 days depending on conditions. If aerosolized intentionally, SARS -CoV-2 is stable for at least several hours. The seasonal ity of COVID -19 transmission is unknown. SARS -CoV-2 on surfaces is inactivated rapidly with sunlight. Additional testi ng on SARS -CoV-2, as opposed to surrogate viruses, is needed to support initial estimates of stability. Decontamination - What are effective methods to kill the agent in the environment? ..........................................................14 Soap and water, as well as common alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. Methods for decontaminating N95 masks have been approved by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Additional decontamination studies, particularly with regard to PPE and other items in short supply, are needed. PPE - What PPE is effective, and who should be using it? .......................................................................................................15 The effectiveness of PPE for SARS -CoV-2 is currently unknown, and data from other related coronaviruses are us ed for guidance. He althcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID -19, even with recommended PPE. Most PPE recommendations have not been made on SARS -CoV-2 data, and comparative efficacy of different PPE for different t asks (e.g., intubat ion) is unknown. Identification of efficacious PPE for healthcare workers is critical due to their high rates of infection. Forensics - Natural vs intentional use? Tests to be used for attribution. ................................................................................16 All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species . Identifying the intermediate species between bats and humans would a id in reducing potential spillover from a natural source. Wide sampling of bats, other wild animals, and humans is needed to address the origin of SARS -CoV-2. Genomics - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains ? ..................................................................................17 Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates substitutions and mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. Mutations and deletions in specific portions of the SARS -CoV-2 gen ome have not been linked to any changes in transmission or disease severity, though modeling work is attempting to identify possible changes. Research linking genetic changes to differences in phenotype (e.g., transmissibili ty, virulence, progression in patients) is needed. Forecasti ng - What forecasting models and methods exist? ...................................................................................................18 Forecasts differ in how they handle public health in terventions such as shelter -in-place orders and tracking how methods change in the near future will be important for understanding limitations going forward. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 6/23/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 3 Infectious Dose - How much agent will make a healthy individual ill? What do we know? The human infectious dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. SARS -CoV-2 is the cause of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID -19). Studies from other animal models are used as surrogates for humans. Non-hum an primates A total dose of approximately 700,000 plaque -forming units (PFU) of the novel coronavirus SARS -CoV-2 infected macaques via combination exposure (106 TCID 50 total dose).380 Macaques did not exhibit clinical symptoms, but shed virus from the nose and throat.380 Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques showed mild to moderate clinical infections at doses of 4.75x106 PFU (SA RS-CoV-2 delivered through several routes), while common marmosets developed mild infections when exposed to 1.0x106 PFU macaques the ocular conjunctival and intratracheal route at a of approximately 700,000 PFU (106 TCID 50).125 Rhesus macaques infected with of -CoV-2 by the intranasal, intratrache al, oral and ocular routes combined recapitulate moderate human disease .320 African green monkeys replicate key asp ects of human disease, including severe pathological symptoms (exposed to 500,000 PFU via intranasal and mild cl inical osol exposures betwee n 5,000 and 16,000 PFU),184 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS ), with small particle aerosol exposure doses as low as 2,000 PFU .44 Rodents Golden Syrian hamsters exposed to 80,000 TCID 50 (~56,000 PFU) via the intranasal route deve loped clinical symptoms reminiscent of mild human infections (all hamsters infected).407 In a separate study, immunosuppressed Golden Syrian hamsters showed severe clinical symptoms (including death) after exposure to 100 -10,000 PFU via intranasal challenge .53 Golden Syrian hamsters infected with 100,000 PFU intranasally exhibited mild clinical symptoms and developed neutralizing antibodies,82 and were also capable of infecting individuals in separate cages. In another study, older hamsters had more severe symptoms, took longer to recover, and developed fewer neutralizing antibodi es than younger hamsters .337 Mice genetically mod ified to express the human ACE2 receptor (transgenic hACE2 mice) were inoculated intranasally with 100,000 TCID 50 (~70,000 PFU), and all mice developed pathological symptoms consistent with COVID -19.31 Transgenic (hACE2) mice became infected after timed aerosol exposure (36 TCID 50/minute) to between 900 and 1080 TCID 50 (~630 -756 PFU). All mice (4/4) exposed for 25 -30 minutes became infected, whi le no mice (0/8) became infected after exposure for 0 -20 minutes (up to 720 TCID 50, ~504 PFU).32 Key methodological details (e.g., particle size, quantification of actual aerosol dose) are missing from the study's report. Transgenic (hACE2) mice exposed intr anasally to 400,000 PFU of SARS -CoV-2 develop clinical and pathological symptoms seen in h umans.420 Other animal models Ferrets infected with 316,000 TCID 50226 600,000 TCID 50372 of SARS -CoV-2 by the intranasal route show similar symptoms to human disease.226, 372 Uninfected ferrets in direct contact with infected ferrets test pos itive and show disease as early as 2 d ays post -contact.226 In one study, direct contact was required to transfer infection between ferrets,226 however, transmission without direct contact was found in another study.372 In a fer ret study, 1 in 6 individuals exposed to 102 PFU via the intranasal route became infected, while 12 out of 12 individuals exposed to >104 PFU became infected.389 Domestic cats exposed to 100,000 PFU of SARS -CoV-2 via the intranasal route developed severe pathological symptoms including lesions in the nose, throat, and lungs.405 In a separate study, infected cats showed no clinical signs, but were able to shed virus and transmit to other cats.47 Related Coronaviruses The infectious dose for severe acute r espiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS -CoV-1) in mice is estimated to be between 67-540 PFU (average 240 PFU, i ntranasal route).121, 123 Genetically modified mice expressing DPP4 exposed intranasally to doses of M iddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV) between 100 and 500,000 PFU show signs of infection. Infection with higher doses result in severe syndromes.13, 104, 258, 508 What do we need to know? Ident ifying the infectious dose for humans by the various routes through which we become infected is critical to the effective development of computational models to predict risk, develop diagnostics and countermeasures, and effective decontamination strategies. Animal studies are a plausible surrogate.

How easily is it spread? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is passed easily between humans, likely through close contact with relatively large droplets and possibly through smaller aerosolized particle s. Pandemic COVID -19 has caused 9,129,702 infections and 472,793 deaths211 in at least 188 countries and territories (as of 6/23/2020 ).72, 398, 465 In the US there are 2,312,413 confirmed COVID -19 cases across all 50 US states, with 120,402 deaths (as of 6/23/2020).211 Initial high -quality estimates of human transmissibility (R 0) range from 2.2 to 3.1.292, 346, 376, 477, 507 Based on contact tracing of 1,058 cases in Hong Kong, the number of cases linked to superspreading events (1 person infects >6 -8 people) for COVID -19 is estimated to be similar to other pathogens.10 SARS- CoV-2 is believ ed to spread through close contact and droplet transmission,76 with fomite transmission likely214 upper respi ratory tract,192 and infectious virus is detectable in throat and lung tissue for at least 8 days.468 Respiratory fluids from severely ill patients contained higher viral RNA loads than respiratory fluids from mildly ill patients.511 Additionally, vir al RNA was detectable for longer in secretions from severely ill patients.511 SARS- CoV-2 RNA has been found in semen from both clinically symptomatic and recovered cases,257 however, the infectiousness and the possibility of sexual transmission is unknown. Infectious SARS -CoV-2 has been cult ured from patient feces481 and urine.418 Contamination of patient rooms with aerosolized SARS -CoV-2 in the human respirable range (0.25 -2.5 m) indicates the potential for airborne transmission.276 Viral RNA was detected up to 4 meters from ICU patient beds.177 To date infectious virus has not bee n isolated from aerosol samples.394 SARS- CoV-2 may be spread by conversation and exhalation.7, 256, 394, 412 A preliminary study in China detailing a restaurant - associated outbreak supports transmission via aerosol.265 Contact tracing in Japan has identified clusters associated with gatherings in bars, restaurants, music festi vals, and other social activities involving close contact.497 Experimentally infected ferrets were able to transmit SARS -CoV-2 to other ferrets by both direct contac t (another ferret in same enclosure) as well as through the air (ferrets in an adjacent enclosure, separated by 10 cm).372 Similar results have been documented in transgenic mice.32 Evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 is not transmitted to infants during birth.88, 93, 96, 397, 490, 494 Statistical analysis suggests that higher temperatures are not enough to substantially reduce COVID -19 transmission.399 Individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to others before they have symptoms. Individuals may be infectious for 1 -3 days prior to symptom onset,452 and culturable virus has been found up to 6 days prior to symptom onset.24 Pre-symptomatic45, 231, 411, 417, 486, 510 or asymptom atic29, 197, 286 patients can transmit SARS -CoV-2, and asymptomatic individuals shed virus for as long as mildly symptomatic individuals .279 At least 12% of all cases are estimated to be due to asymptom atic transmission.133 It has been estimated that 23%,273 44%,186 or as much as 56%68 of infections may be caused by pre -symptomatic transmis sion. Individuals are most infectious before symptoms began and within 5 days of symptom onset,95 and pre -symptomatic individuals contribute to environmental contamination.212 Attack rates of the virus are higher among household members than casual contacts .58, 402 The attack rate ranges from 11%,42 16%,262 and 38%381 of household members, with rates increasing with age.381 Individuals transmit infection to household members before they exhibit symptoms at least as often as they do after symp toms develop .215 Undetected cases play a major role in tran smission, and most cases are not reported. Models suggest up to 86% of early COVID -19 cases in China were undetected, and these infections were the source for 79% of reported cases.261 Models estimate that the true number of cases may be approximately 11 times greater than the reported number of cases in the UK,491 and 5 to 10 times greater than the reported number of cases in the US.216, 388 Preliminary estimates of the case reporting rate vary widely among countries, from roughly 1 reported case for every 3 actual cases (in Germany), to 1 in 149 (in China).234 In Geneva, Switzerland, serological results indicate that there were approximately 11 unreported infections for eve ry reported infection just after the peak number of daily cases.413 Individuals who have recovered clinically, but test positive, appear unable to transmit COVID -19. Epidemiological investigations by the Korean CDC suggest that individuals who have clinically recovered from COVID -19, but later show PCR positive tests, are not infectious.224 What do we need to know? The relative contribution of different routes of transmission , such as close contact and droplet transmission versus aerosol transmission and contaminated objects and surfaces (fomite s) remains uncertain .

REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 6/23/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 5 Host Range - How many species does it infect? Can it transfer from species to species? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is closely re lated to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the identity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown. Early genomic analysis indicates similarity to SARS -CoV-1,515 with a suggested bat origin.106, 515 Positive samples from the South China Seafood Market strongly suggests a wildlife source,78 though it is pos sible that the virus was circulating in humans before the disease was associated with the seafood market.35, 107, 483, 495 Analysis of SARS -CoV-2 genomes suggests that a non -bat intermediate species is responsible for the beginning of the outbreak.379 The identity of the intermediate host rema ins unknown.264, 268, 270 Viruses similar to SARS -CoV-2 were present in pangolin samples col lected several years ago.244 However, a recent survey of 334 pangolins did not identify any coronavirus nucleic acid in 'upstream' market chain samples, suggesting that positive samples from pangolins may be the result of animal exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade network. These data suggest that pangolins are incidental hosts of coronaviruses.251 SARS -CoV-2 uses the s ame receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2002/2003. Experiments show that SARS -CoV-2 Spike (S) re ceptor -binding domain bin ds the human cell receptor (ACE2) stronger than SARS- CoV-1,473 potentially explaining its high transmissibility. The same work suggests that differences between SARS - CoV-2 and SARS -CoV-1 Spike pro teins may limit the therapeutic ability of SARS antibody treatments.473 Modeling of SARS -CoV-2 Spik e and ACE2 proteins suggests that SARS -CoV-2 can bind and infect human, bat, civet, monkey and swine cells.443 Host range predictions based on structural modelin g, however, are difficult,157 and additional animal studies are needed to better define the hos t range. In vitro experiments suggest a broad host range for SARS -CoV-2, with more than 44 potential animal hosts, based on viral binding to species- specific ACE2 orthologs.274 The host range is predicted to be limited primarily to mammals. Genetic and protein analysis of primates suggests that Afric an and Asian primates are likely more susceptible to SARS - CoV-2, while South and Central American primates are likely less susceptible .307 Identifying the SARS -CoV-2 host range is important for identifying animal reservo irs. Changes in proteolytic cleavage of the Spike protein can also affect cell entry and animal host range, in addition to receptor bi nding.308 To date, ferrets, mink, hamsters, cats, and primates have been shown to be susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infec tion. It is unknown whether these animals can transmit infection to humans. Animal model studies suggest that Golden Syria n hamsters, primates, and ferrets may be susceptible to infection.82, 226 In the Netherlands , farmed mink developed breathing and gastrointestinal issues, which was diagnosed as SARS -CoV-2 infection.1 It is thought that an infected mink has transmitted SARS -CoV-2 to a human.236 Golden Syrian hamsters are able to infect other hamsters via direct contact and c lose quarters aerosol transmission.407 Domestic cats are susceptible to infection with SARS -CoV-2 (100,000- 520,000 PFU via the intranasal route405 or a combination of routes179), and can transmit the virus to other cats via droplet or short -distance aerosol.405 Dogs exposed to SARS -CoV-2 produced anti -SARS -CoV-2 antibodies47 but exhibited no clinical symptoms.405, 408 Wild cats (tigers)451 can be infected with SARS -CoV-2, although their ability to spread to humans is unknown.293, 504 Two cases have been confirmed of pet domestic cats infected with SARS -CoV-2.71 Ducks, chickens, and pigs remained uninfect ed after experimental SARS -CoV-2 exposure (30,000 CFU for ducks and chickens, 100,000 PFU for pigs, all via intranasal rou te).405 There is currently no evidence that SARS -CoV-2 infects livestock,203 though modeling suggests sheep, cows, pigs, and goats may be susceptible to infection by SARS -CoV-2.243 Pigs and chickens were not susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection when expos ed to an intranasal dose of 105 TCID 50 (~70,000 PFU), confirmed by lack of positive swab and tissue samples.158 Fruit bats and ferrets were susc eptible to this same exposu re.158 Chicken, turkey, duck, qua il, and geese were not susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 after experimental exposures.416 What do we need to know? Several animal models have been developed to recreate hu man -like illness, though to date they have been infected with high dose exposures. Lower dose studies may better replicate human disea se acquisition. What is the intermediate host(s)? Can infected animals transmit to humans (e.g., pet cats to humans)? Can SARS -CoV-2 circulate in animal reservoir populations, potentially leadi ng to future spillover events?

Are people infectious during this time? What do we know? The majority of individuals develop symptoms within 14 days of exposure. For most people, it takes at least 2 days to develop symptoms, and on average symptoms develop 5 days after exposure. Incubating individuals can transmit disease for several days before symptom onse t. Some indi viduals never develop symptoms but can still transmit disease. The best current estimate of the COVID -19 incubation period is 5.1 days , with 99% of individuals exhibiting symptoms within 14 days of exposure.250 Fewer than 2.5% of infected ind ividuals show symptoms sooner than 2 days after exposure.250 Individuals can test positive for COVID -19 even if they lac k clinical symptoms.29, 81, 176, 426, 510 Individuals can be infectious while a symptomatic,76, 384, 426, 510 and asymptomatic and pre -symptomatic individuals have similar amounts of virus in the nose and throat compared to symptomatic patients.24, 225, 518 Peak infectiousness may be during the incubation period, one day before symptoms develop.186 Infectious virus has been cultured in patients up to 6 days before the development of symptoms.24 Infectious period is unknown, but possibly up to 10 -14 days .6, 261, 398 Asymptomatic individuals are estimated to be infectious for a median of 9.5 days.195 On average, there are approximat ely 4133 to 7.5260 days between symptom onset in successive cases of a single transmission chain (i.e., the serial interval). Based on data from 339 transmission chains in China, the mean serial interval is 5.29 days. 132 Children are estimated to shed virus for 15 days on average, with asymptomatic individual s shedding virus for less time (11 days) than symptomatic individual s (17 days).284 Most hospitalized individuals are admitted within 8 -14 days of symptom onset.513 What do we need to know? The incubation period is well -characterized. Patients may be infectious, however, for days before symptoms develop.

Approximately 18 -31%422 of patient s are asymptomatic through out the course of their infection.315, 328, 431 These estimates are based on studies that mi nimize the likel ihood of including pre -symptomatic patients, which can obscure asymptomatic rates.24 Many clinically asymptomatic COVID -19 cases show evidence of lung abnormalities by computed tomography .237 Most symptomatic COVID -19 cases are mild (81%, n=44,000 cas es).426 Initial COVID -19 symptoms include fever (87.9% overall, but only 44 -52% present with fever initially),22, 176 cough (67.7%),176 fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, and reduced lymphocyte count.77, 85, 196 Chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and loss of taste or smell350, 488 are also possible COVID -19 symptoms.77 The prevalence of GI symptoms varies.160 Neurological symptoms such as agita tion and confusion may present with COVID -19,187 may be more common in severe cases,114 and neurological involve ment (e.g., encephalitis) can be seen in brain tissue on autopsy.441 Ocular issues479 and skin lesions may also be symptoms of COVID - 19.48 There are concerns that COVID -19 can lead to new -onset diabetes in previously healthy patients.386 Com plications include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 17 -29% of hospitalized patients, leading to death in 4 - 15% of cases),92, 196, 445 pneumonia,342 cardiac injury (20%),406 kidney damage,23, 414 arrhythmia, sepsis, and shock.176, 196, 445, 513 Most deaths are c aused by re spiratory failure or respiratory failure combined with heart damage.385 A number of immunological indicators may help differentiate between severe and non -severe cases.27, 138, 185, 198, 356, 419 Approximately 15% of hospitalized patients are classified as severe,176, 426 and approximately 5% of patients are admitted to the ICU.176, 426 Patient deterioration c an be rapid.172 The survival rate of patients requiring mechanical ventilation varies widely (e.g., 35%,202 70%,25 75.5%373). Recent evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 ma y attack blood vessels in the lung, leading to clotting complications and ARDS.9, 439 Clotting issues may be associated with sev erely ill COVID -19 patients228 and those with ARDS.114 COVID -19 patients should be monitored for possible thrombosis.254 COVID -19 patients undergoing unrelated surgical procedures have high levels of postoperative complications and mortality.324 The case fatality rate varies substantially by patient age and underlying comorbidities. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension,502 diabetes, and respiratory conditions all increase the CFR.426, 513 Hypertension and obesity are common in the US160 and contribute to mortality.23, 344 Individuals >60 are at higher risk of death, and the CFR for individuals >85 is between 10 and 27%.426, 513 In a small study, men exhibited more severe symptoms and died at higher rates than women.213 The effect of comorbidities on the likelihood of severe symptoms is higher for men.309 Deaths due to COVID -19 are underreported. In New York City, up to 5,293 (22%) of period -specific excess deaths are unexplained and could be related to the pandemic.334 More work is neede d. Additional studies on vulnerable subpopulations are required. Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) populations acquire SARS -CoV-2 infection at higher rates than ot her groups341 and are disproportionately represented in hospitalized populations.160, 357 African Ame rican communities contribute disproportionately to the number of deaths in the US.190, 313 Over 40% of the Latino patients in the Baltimore , MD and Washington, DC metro area who sought testing in a single health network tested positive, which is much higher than other racial and ethnic groups in the same region and network .295 Pregnant women appear to develop severe symptoms at the same rate as the general population,91, 221, 499 and current reports suggest no increase in risk of pre -term birth.489 Severe symptoms in pregnant women may be associated with underlying conditions such as obesity.277 Most studies of COVID -19 in pregnancy represent women in later stages of pregnancy. Children are susc eptible to COVID -19,130 though general ly show milder86, 283 or no symptoms. Between 21 -28% of children may be asymptomatic.283, 347, 359 Most symptomatic children present with mild or moderate symptoms,347 with few exhibiting severe or clinical illness.476 Severe symptoms in children are possible272 and more likely in those with complex medical histories400 or underlying conditions such as obesity.498 Infant deaths have been recorded.56, 283 Early reports indicate the possibility of rare hyperinflammatory syndromes or shock in children (termed Pediatric Multi - System Inflammatory Syndrome)167 linked to COVID -19 infection.377 The WHO464 and US CDC210 have issued case definitions for this condition. What do we need to know? The true case fatality rate is unknown, as the exact number of cases is uncertain. Testing priorities and case definitions vary by locatio n. The proportion of asymptomatic infections is not known. How long does it take for infected individuals to recover o utside of a healthcare setting? What proportion of infected individuals are asymptomatic? Does this vary b y age, location, or comorbidities? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 6/23/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 8 Protective Immunity - How long does the immune response provide protection from reinfection? What do we know? Infected patients show productive immune responses, however more data is needed. In a limited study (n=9), hospitalized patients shed high levels of infectious virus for 7 days via the nasal -pharyngeal route, 50% of patients produced antibodies within 7 day s, and all patients produced antibodies by 14 days. Antibody production did not correlate with lower viral load.468 In a larger study (n=175), most patients developed neutralizing antibodies within 10 -15 days after disease onset. Elderly patients had significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than younger patients.475 In a separate study, elderl y patients also showed higher viral loads than younger patients.430 Approximately half of infected individuals on an aircraft carrier developed detectable neutralizing antibody responses to SARS -CoV-2.350 In a study of 285 COVID -19 patients, 100% developed anti viral immunoglobulin -G within 19 days of symptom onset.278 The neut ralizing ability of these antibodies was not tested.278 In a smaller in vitro study (n=23 patients), leve ls of antibodies (immunoglobulins M and G) were positively correlated with SARS -CoV-2 neutralizing ability.430 In a smaller study of 44 patients, plasma from 91% demonstrated SARS -CoV-2 neutralizing ability, appearing roughly 8 days after symptom onset.421 In a small comparison series (n=74), both asym ptomatic and mildly symptomatic individuals showed reductions in IgG antibody levels 8 weeks after infection.279 The correlation to long -term immunity is unknown. In a small study (n=26 mild cases), researchers found prolonged persistence of SARS -CoV-2 antibodies and SARS -CoV-2 RNA for up to 50 days.444 Previous studies on c oronavirus immunity suggest that neutralizing antibodies may wane after several years.62, 478 More data are nee ded. A small subset of COVID -19 patients in China (8%) did not develop a serological response to infection, though the potential for reinfection in these patients is unknown.475 Similarly, between 16.7% (fo r IgG) and 51.7% (for IgM) of patients in a separate study did not exhibit any immune response, in terms of p roduction of those two types of antibodie s.423 In a study of 221 COVID -19 patients, levels of two types of antibodies (I gM and IgG) were not associated with the severity of symptoms.194 However, in a smaller study, patients with severe disease s howed stronger antibody responses than those with non -severe symptoms.430 The early recov ery phase of COVID -19 patients is characterized by inflammatory immune response,454 suggesting the potential for adverse reactions after clinical improvement. Two studies identified key components of the adaptive i mmune system (CD4+ T cells) in the majority of recovered COVID - 19 patients, and these cells reacted to SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein.51, 173 These studies also identified Spike protein responses in CD4+ T cells o f ~30 -40% of unexposed patients,173 suggesting some cross -reactivity between other circulating hum an coronaviruses and SARS -CoV-2.51, 173 The degree of protection provided by cross -reactivity is currently unknown. Currently, there is no evidence that recovered patients can be reinfected with SARS -CoV-2. Two stu dies suggest limited reinfection potential in macaques. In the first, two experimentally infected macaques were not capable of being reinfected 28 days after their primary infection resolved.30 In the second, rhesus macaques exposed to different doses of SARS -CoV-2 via the intr anasal and intratracheal routes (104 - 106 PFU) developed pathological infection and were protected upon secondary challenge 35 days after initial exposure (little to no clinical symptoms, large reduction in viral titer compared to initial infection).84 Longer -term research and work in humans still needs to be conducted.84 Ferrets infected with 102-104 PFU were protected from acute lung injury following secondary challenge w ith SARS -CoV-2 28 days after initial exposure, but they did exhibit clinical symptoms such as lethargy and ruffled f ur.389 Cats exposed to SARS- CoV-2 after initial recovery did not shed virus, suggesting some prote ctive effect of primary infection.47 According to the WHO, there is no evidence of re -infection with SARS -CoV-2 after recovery.249 Patients can te st positive via PCR for up to 37 days after symptoms appear,513 and after recovery and hospital discharge.245 The ability of these individuals to infect others is unknown. The stre ngth and duration of any immunity after initial COVID -19 infection is unknown.16, 461 In a 35-year study of 10 men, immunity to seasonal coronaviruses tended to wane after one year, with reductio ns in circulating antibodies detectable with in 6 months.136 Reinfection was observed between one and three years after initial infection.136 What do we need to know? As the pandemic continues, long -term monitoring of immune activity and reinfection status is needed. How long does the immune response last? Is there evidence of waning immunity? Can humans become reinfected? How does the pati ent immune response vary by age or disease severity? How do different components of the immune response co ntribute to long -term protection? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 6/23/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 9 Clinical Diagnosis - Are there tools to diagnose infected individuals? When during infection ar e they effective? What do we know? Diagnosis relies on identifying the genetic signature of the virus in patient nose, throat, or sputum samples. These tests are relatively accurate. Confirmed cases are still underreported. The US CDC has expanded testing criteria to inclu de symptomatic patients at clinician discretion.33 PCR pro tocols and primers have been widely shared internationally.69, 109, 260, 404, 459, 466 PCR-based diagnostic assays are unable to differentiate between active and inactive virus. A combination of pharyngeal (throat ) RT-PCR and chest tomography is the most effective diagnostic criteria (correctly diagnoses 91.9% of in fections).370 A single throat swab detects 78.2% of inf ections, and duplicate tests identify 86.2% of infections.370 PCR tests using saliva are at least as effective as those using nasopharyngeal swabs,89, 480 and may be useful for at -home sampling. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs may be less effective as di agnostic specimens th an sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid,447 although evidence is mixed.468 Combination RT -PCR and serology (antibody) testing may increase the abi lity to diagnose patients with mild symptoms, or identify patients at higher risk of severe disease.509 Assays targeting antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein (N) instead of the Spike protein (S) of SARS -CoV-2 may improve detection.57 The timing of diagnostic PCR tests impacts results. The false -negative rate for RT PCR tests is lowest between 7 and 9 days after exposure, and PCR tests are more likely to give fals e-negative results before symptoms begin (within 4 days of exposure) and more than 14 days after exposure.240 The FDA is sued an Emergency Use Authorization for an antigen- based diagnostic assay, limited to use in certified laboratories (clinical laboratory improvement amen dments, CLIA).141 The FDA released an Emergency Use Authorization enabling laboratories to develop and use tests in -house for patient diagnosis.146 Tests from the US CDC are available to states.69, 76 Multiple rapi d or real -time test kits have been produced by universities and industry, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology,116 BGI,40 Cepheid,440 Abbot,144 and Mesa Biotech.43 Home tests are being developed; however, none are FDA approved, nor are they useable as a diagnosti c.321-322, 345 The US CDC is developing serological tests to determine prevalence of SARS -CoV-2 exposure .219 Artificial intelligence algorithms were ab le to improve the ability of radiologists to distinguish COVID -19 pneumonia from non-COVID -19 pneumonia on chest CT scans.28 Validated serological (antibody) assays are being developed to help determine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2. Serological evidence of exp osure does not indicate immunity. Researchers found high specificity in a number of enzyme -linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), though sample sizes for SARS- CoV-2 patients were small.333 Additional research has shown high variability in the ability of tests (ELISA and lateral flow assays) by different manufacturers to accurately detect positive and negati ve cases (sensitivity and specificity, respectively) .248, 455 Lateral flow a ssays may be less reliable than ELISA.11 The FDA has recommended against the use of several dozen serologica l diagnostic assays based on failure to conform to updated regulatory requirements.143 Researchers have designed a standardized ELISA procedure for SARS -CoV-2 serology samples aimed at minimizing false positive s and false negatives.229 Serological studi es show that the proportion of individuals exposed to SARS -CoV-2 remains low in locations affected by the pandemic early, such as Wuhan (3.2 -3.8%)485 and Hong Kong (2.5 -4.0%).429 In one German town, serological testing has been used to identify the percent of the population already exposed to SARS -CoV-2 (14%), which can assist in public health response planning.367 Preliminary serological studies in Santa Clar a and Los Angeles, California, estimated that 2.5 -4.1% of the population has already been exposed to SARS -CoV-2 since the first confirmed cases in Jan uary,37, 296 which is between 28 and 85 times greater than offic ial reports. There are issues, however, with non -random study populations,37 as well as fals e positive rates of the diagnostic tests themselves.296 The false positive rate of the diagnostic assay used may a ccount for a substantial portion of the reported infections,37 particularly if the true proportion of positive patients is l ow. Through the end of March, serological surveys estimate that 14% of th e adult population of New York were exposed to COVID -19.382 What do we n eed to know? In general, PCR tests appear to be sensitive and specific, though confirmation o f symptoms via chest CT is recommended. The sensitivity and specificity of serological testing methods is variable, and additional work needs to be done to determ ine factors that affect test accuracy. How accurate are clinical diagnoses compared to genetic tests? How many serological tests need to be done to obtain an accurate picture of underlying exposure? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 6/23/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 10 Medical Treatments - Are there effective treatments? What do we know? Treatment for COVID -19 is primarily supportive care including ventilation if necessary.176, 297 Numerous clinical trials are ongoing. Several drugs show efficacy. Remdesivir shows promise for reducing symptom duration in humans.36 Remdesivir can reduce the duration of symptoms in infected individuals, from 15 days to 11 days on average (compared to controls).36 Remdesivir received an Emergency Use Authorization from FDA.326 Five and ten- day courses of remdesivir showed similar effects in preliminary Phase III trial results, but were not compare d to a control group.168 In a separate clinical trial of sev ere COVID -19 patients, the effects of remdesivir were inconclusive due to a limitation in the study sample size.449 This trial ended early, reducing its statistical power.449 Hydroxychloroquine is associated with elevate d risk of cardiac arrhythmias and provides limited to no clinical benefit at this point in time. Large, ra ndomized clin ical trial results are necessary. Preliminary results from the RECOVERY trial indicate no benefit of hydroxychloroquine in terms of reduced mortality when administered to hospitalized patients. 191 The trial has stopped administering hy droxychloroqu ine to new patients.191 The NIH has stopped the ORCHID clinical trial on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine, stating that there was no evidence of harm but the drug was unlikely to provide a benefit to patients. 323 Other e xisting studies have found no benefit of hydroxychloroquine (with or without azithromycin)90, 163, 288 -289, 424 as well a s card iac side effects39, 101, 165, 208, 290, 310 and elevated r isk of mortality.288 Individuals taking hydroxychloroquine for autoimmune disorder s were not protected from COVID -19,164 though sample sizes were limited. Patients giv en hydroxychloroquine after exposure to COVID -19 developed illness at the same rate as untreated patients, indicating no protective benefit.49 A large observational study showing elevated mortality in patients taking hydroxychlor oquine was retracted due to lack of access to primary data.306 The FDA revoked its EUA for hydroxychloroquine on 6/15/20 .140 Initial results purporting benefits of hydroxychloro quine and azithromycin162 have been called into question by other researchers200 and the journal's publishing society.206 One small clinic al trial (n=62) suggests that hydroxychloroquine can reduce recovery time compared to control group.94 Key details are missing from this preprint.94 A small retrospective study (n=48) found benefits to hydroxychloroquine, though details on patient study population selection were limited.492 Dexamethasone may significantly reduce mortality in severely ill and v entilated patients. A press release from the RECOVERY trial (n=2,104) indicates substantial reductions in mortality for ventilated patients given the steroid dexamethasone (27% mortality in treated patients, 41% in untreated controls), and smaller reductio ns in mortality for patients receiving supplemental oxygen (20% mortality in treated patients, 25% in untreated controls). 366 Dexamethasone did not reduce mortality in patients who did not need oxygen or mechanical ventilation.366 Other pharmaceutical interventions are being investigated. Two studies of methylprednisolone suggest clinical benefits in severely ill patients (e.g., reduction in ventilator use, mortality), but have not been tested separately from other standard -of-care treatments.110, 393 There is evidence for efficacy of several interferon -based treatments, including inte rferon beta -1b,201 interferon beta -1a,120 -2b.352 In these s tudies, interferons were generally administered with other treatments such as hydroxychloro quine or lopinavir/ritonavir. Small, observational studies have found benefits of tocilizumab383, 410, 484 and sarilumab38 in severe COVID -19 patients, and Phase II trial results show limited r educt ions in mortality.354 Tocili zumab efficacy may depend on C -reactive protein levels155, 294 and m ay be more beneficial when administered early.171 Limited, preliminary evidence from clinical trials supports the efficacy of favipiravir ,87 intravenous immunoglobulin,64 and ivermectin.362 Lenzilumab, a monoclonal antibody, showed benefit s to oxygenation levels in severely ill patients (n= 12).425 There is n o clinical benefit from combination ritonavir /lopinavir .63, 266 Early results from a randomized clinical trial found that high doses of chloroquine diphosphate were associated with toxicity and lethality in severel y ill patients.46 Phase II clinical trial results for the kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib showed few severe side effects and suggested benefits in terms of symptom duration and mortality.65 The anticoagulant heparin is being used to mitigate risks of pulmonary embolism.138 Systemic anticoagulant use was associated with reduced mortality rates in severely ill patients.343 Passive antib ody therapy (convalescent serum)66 is being given to patients,145 appears safe,220 and several small trials (<50 patients) suggest benefits f rom convalescent patient plasma for infected patients.271, 392, 401, 403 Results from a randomized clinical trial (n=103) showed no significant benefits of plasma therapy, though the sample size was low .259 More work is needed to confirm a reported link between androgen levels and disease severity in male patients.170, 317, 442 What do we need to know? Additional information on treatment efficacy is required, particularly from large randomized clinical trials. Do monoclonal antibodies exhibit any efficacy in human trials?

What do we know? Work is ongoing to develop a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine in human and animal trials. Early results are being released, but evidence should be considered preliminary until larger trials are completed. Multiple entities are working to produce a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine (e. g., o peration Warp Johnso n and Johnson.218 Phase II Trials (initial testing for efficacy, continued testing for safety): China's CanSino is the first to complete Phase I saf ety trials of their adenovirus type5 v ector based SARS -CoV-2 vaccine, Ad5- nCoV, and has advanced to Phase II human trials.267 University of Oxford's ChAdOx1 candidate has begun Phase II/III human trials.339 Moderna is beginning its P hase II trial of mRNA -1273 with 600 participants.298 Phase I Trials (initial testing for safety) : Imperial College Londo n is beginning Phase I/II trials of their self -replicating RNA vaccine candidate.331 Johnson and Johnson, via partnership with Janssen, plans to begin Phase I/II trials of their Ad26.COV2 -S recombinant vaccine candidate.217 Sinovac Biote ch has reported that their inactivated virus vaccine shows protective effects in rhesus macaques, particularly at high doses.159 The vaccine is currently in Phase I clinical trials.105 Phase I trial results for the CanSino vaccine (Ad5 -nCoV) showed few severe adverse reactions in humans within 28 days of follow -up (side effects included fever [sometimes severe], fatigue, headache, and muscle pain).516 Immune res ponses were found in most patients, peaking at 14 days for T -cells and 28 days fo r antibodies.516 Efficacy trials are ongoing. Preliminary data from a Phase I trial of Moderna's mRNA -1273 candidate suggest that the vaccine is well -tolerated by human subjects, and induces an antibody response against SARS -CoV-2.316 Inovio had thei r IND approved by the FDA and have started their Phase I clinical trials on their DNA vaccine candidate IN O- 4800.390 Shenzhen Geno -Immune Medical Institute is testing its aAPC303 and lentiviral301 vaccines in Phas e I clinical trials. BioNTech and Pfizer's BNT162 program is in Phase I/II clinical trial for four of its mRNA vaccine candidates.355 The ChAdOx1 platform has shown protective efficacy in rhesus macaques in preclinica l trials. Safety and efficacy still need to be determined in human trials.437 The Beijing Institute of Biolo gical Products/Wuhan Institute of Biological Products have initiated a Phase I trial of their inactivated vaccine candid ate.467 Symvivo Corporation ha s received approval to begin a Phase I trial with their oral bacTRL -Spike vaccine candidate in Canada.299 Novavax is testing a recombinant spike protein nanoparticle vaccine in Phase I trials.300 Immunitor LLC is starting Phase I trials of a heat -inactivated vaccine derived from pooled patient plasma.305 Aivita Biomedical will begin a Phase Ib/II randomized double -blind clinical trial of 180 people, specifically healthcare workers and first responders. Their vaccine DC -ATA consists of autologous dendritic cells loaded with antige SARS - CoV-2.302 Clover Biopharmaceuticals (with GSK, Dynavax) will begin a Phase I trial of their vaccine SCB -2019, a recombinant SARS subunit vacc ine.304 Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology (Russia) is beginning Phase I trials of their adenoviral vaccine candidate Gam -COVID -Vac.463 Additional vac cine research Rese arch has identified several DNA vaccine candidates that show protective efficacy in rhesus macaques, in terms of reduction in viral load compared to non -vaccinated controls, though animals exhibited mild clinical symptoms.493 Human trials with these candidates are needed.

What do we know? Broad- scale control measures such as sta y-at-home orders are effective at reducing movement and contact rates, and modeling shows evidence that they reduce transmission. Social distancing an d other policies are estimated to have reduced COVID -19 spread by 44% in Hong Kong113 and reduced spread throughout China233, 239, 242, 280, 291 and Italy.161 Restrictive lockdowns in Chi na are esti mated to have reduced disease transmission within only a few days,517 in part, through reductions in an individual's average number o f contacts.500 In China, modeling suggests that a one -day delay in implementing control measures increased the time needed to curtail an outbreak by 2.4 days.131 Modeling demonstrates that multifaceted restrictions and quarantines in China reduced the R 0 of SARS -CoV-2 from greater than 3 to less than 1 between January 23 and February 5.340 Additionally, movement restrictions and other con trol measures helped limit the amount of t ime where community transmission was possible (i.e., R 0 > 1).501 A US county -level model found that shelter in place orders (SIPOs) and restaurant and bar closures were associated with large reductions in exponential growth rate of cases.111 School clos ures and cancellation of large gatherings had smaller effects.111 Similarly, researchers found that a larger number of public health interventions in place was strongly associated with lower COVID -19 growth rates in the next week.222 On the USS Theodore Roosev elt, individual behaviors such as wearing face coverings and practicing social distancing were associated with reduced risk of COVID -19 infection.350 Mobility152, 247 and physical contact rates209 decline after pu blic health control measures are implemented . Modeling suggests that on their own, travel restrictions are ineffective at reducing COVID -19 spread and only delay peak prevalence by only a few days but do not limit epidemic size.15 Models indicate that a combination of school closures, work restrictions, and other measure s are required to effectively limit transmission.149 School closu res alone appear insufficient.207, 242 Non-pharmaceutical interventions in China did not reduce transmission equally across all groups; trans mission rates in younger individuals and hospital workers continued to increase even while overall transmi ssion rates declined.340 Two modeling studies identif ied large reductions in transmission due to coun try lockdowns154 and other social distancing measures,193 with subs tantial variation in the efficacy of particular policies in different countries.154, 193 Contact tracing to identify infected individuals reduces the amount of time infectious individuals can transmit disease in a population and increases t he time between successive cases.42 Robust contact tracing and case finding may be needed to control COVID -19 in the US , but would require additional staff and resources to conduct effectively.450 In South Korea, early implementation of rapid contact tracing, testing, and quarantine of confirmed and suspected case s was able to reduce the transmission rate of COVID -19.417 Modeling studies suggest that contact tracing combined with high levels of testing may limit COVID -19 resurgence once init ial social distancing policies are relaxed.14, 150 Contact traci ng is likely to be more effective when conducted in combination with other control measures such as expanded testing and physical distancing, otherwise the number of contacts necessary for tracing becomes prohibitive.238 Research is needed to help plan for easing of restrictions. Modeling suggests that 20 -30 US states still have self -sustained COVID -19 transmiss ion (R 0 > 1) as of 5/17/2020.433 The same work estimates that very few individuals have been infected overall (4.3% estimated prevalence), even in states with large case and fatality totals (e.g., 16.6% of New York residents). 433 Relaxation of public health interventions is projected to increase cases and deaths.117, 433 Modeling indicates that COVID -19 is likely to become endemic in the US population, with regular, periodic outbreaks, an d that additional social or physical distancing measures may be required for several years to keep cases b elow critical care capacity in absence of a vaccine or effective therapeutic.227 Results d epend critically on the dur ation of immunity after exposure.227 Rolling interventions, whereby social distancing measures are put into place every few weeks, may keep healthcare demand below a cri tical point. 491 A modeling study using Chinese data suggests that carefully balancing control measures to maintain R 0 below 1 would be more efficient than allowing R 0 to increase above 1 at any point.252 The WHO has released guidelines on public health strategy,458 and Johns Hopkins released a report outlining how to re - open certain categories of act ivities (e.g., schools, restaurants, events) while reducing COVID -19 risk.378 Surveys indicate that the majority of Americans were co mplying with non -pharmaceutical interventions .115 What do we need to know? As different US states have implemented differing control measures at vario us times, a comprehensive analysis of social distancing efficacy has not yet been conducted. What are plausible options for relaxing social distancing and other intervention measures without resulting in a resurgence of COVID -19 cases?

If aerosolized intentionally, SARS -CoV-2 is stable for at least several hours. The seasonal ity of COVID -19 transmission is unknown. SARS -CoV-2 on surfaces is in activated rapidly with sunlight.

Infectious virus can be recovered from a surgical ma sk after 7 days (22 \u00b0C, 65% RH).100 SARS- CoV-2 persists for less than 3 days within the pa ges of lib rary books, and for less than 1 day on the exterior of book and DVD covers.4 Experimental studies using SARS -CoV-2 aerosols (1.78 -1.96 m mass median aerodynamic diameter in artificial saliva matrix) found that simulated sunlight rapidly inactivates the virus, with 90% reductions in infectious concentration after 6 minutes in high -intensity sunlight (similar to mid-June ) and 19 minut es in l ow-intensity sunlight (similar to early March or October ).396 In dark conditions, the half -life of aerosolized SARS -CoV-2 is approximately 86 minutes in simulated saliva matrix.396 Humidity had no significant impact on aerosolized virus survival.396 SARS- CoV-2 has an aerosol half -life of 2.7 hours (particles <5 m, tested at 21 -23\u00b0C and 65% RH).435 SARS- CoV-2 is susceptible to heat treatment (70 \u00b0C) but can persist for at least two weeks at refrigerated temperatures (4\u00b0C).100, 364 SARS- CoV-2 genetic material (RNA) was detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic cruise ship passenger rooms up to 17 days after cabins were vacated. The infectiousness of this material is not known.318 In a preliminary study, SARS -CoV-2 stability was enhanced when present with bovine serum albumin, which is commonly used to represent sources of protein found in human sputum.348 No strong evidence exists showing a reduction in transm ission with seasonal increase in temperature and humidity.285 Modeling suggests that even accounting for potential reductions in transmiss ion due to weather and behavioral changes, public health interventions will still need to be in effect to limit COVID -19 transmission.311 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) developed a data -based model for SARS -CoV-2 decay on inert surfaces (stainless steel , ABS plastic and nitrile rubber ) at varying temperature and relative humidity. This model estimates virus decay in the absence of exposure to direct sunlight.128 A recent study determined that approximately 0.1 -1% of initial SARS -CoV-2 inoculated on plastic, stainless steel, glass, ceramics, wood, latex gloves, cotton, paper, and surgical masks remained after 48 hours.275 Approximately 0.1% of SARS - CoV-2 remains in f ecal matter after 6 hours.275 Approximately 0.1% of SARS -CoV-2 in human u rine persists after 4 -5 days.275 RNA in clinical samples collected in vir al transport medium is stable at 18 -25\u00b0C or 2-8\u00b0C for up to 21 days without impacting real -time RT -PCR results.409 RNA in clinical samples is also stable at 4 \u00b0C for up f or 4 weeks with regard to quantitative RT -PCR testing (given that the sample contains 5,000 copies/mL). Separately, storage of RNA in PBS at room - temperature (18 -25\u00b0C) resulted in unstable sample concentrations.351 Surrogate Coronavirus data : Studies suggest that other coronaviruses can survive on non- porous surfaces up to 9 -10 days (MHV, SARS -CoV),67, 83 and porous surfaces for up to 3 -5 days (SARS -CoV)135 in air conditioned environments (20 -25\u00b0C, 40-50% RH). Coronavirus survival tends to be higher at lower temperatures and lower relative humidity (RH),67, 83, 361, 436 though infectious virus can persist on surfaces for several days in typical office or hospital conditions.436 SARS can persist with trace infectivity for up to 28 days at refrigerated temperatures (4 \u00b0C) on surfaces.67 One hour after aeros olization approximately 63% of airborne MERS virus remained viable in a simulated office environment (25 \u00b0C, 75% RH).358 Porous hospital materials, including paper and cotton cloth, maintain infectious SARS -CoV for a shorter time than non - porous material.241 What do we need to know? Additio nal testing on SARS -CoV-2, as opposed to surrogate viruses, is needed to support initial estimates of stability. Particle size distribution (e.g., droplet, large droplet, and true aerosol distribution) Duration of SARS -CoV-2 infectivity via fomites and sur faces (contact hazard) Stability of SARS -CoV-2 on PPE (e.g., Tyvek ) Evidence for seasonality in transmission, or other environmental impacts (UV, temperature, hum idity) Stability of SARS -CoV-2 in food (to date, no known infections from contaminated food).456 REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 6/23/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 14 Decontamination - What are effective methods to kill the agent in the environment? What do we know? Soap and water, as well as common alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. SARS -CoV-2 Alcohol -based hand rubs are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2.235 Chlorine bleach (1%, 2%), 70% ethanol and 0.05% chlorhexidine are effective against live virus in lab tests.99 Twice -daily cleaning with sodium dichloroisocyanurate decontaminated surfaces in COVID -19 patient hospital rooms.335 EPA has released a list of SARS -CoV-2 disinfectants, but solutions were not tested on SARS -CoV-2.12 Other Coronaviruses Chlorine -based463 and ethanol -based108 solutions are recommended. Heat treatment (56 \u00b0C) is sufficient to kill coronaviruses,361, 512 though effectiveness depends partly on pro tein in the sample.361 70% ethanol, 50% isopropanol, sodium hypochlorite radiation and CCV).391 Ethanol -based biocides effectively disinfect coronaviruses dried on surfaces, including ethanol containing gels similar to hand sanitizer.199, 469 Surface spray disinfectants such as Mikrobac, Dismozon, and Korsolex are effective at reducing infectivity of the closely related SARS -CoV-1 afte r 30 minutes of contact.360 Coronaviruses may be resistant to heat inactivation for up to 7 days when stabilized in stool.427-428 Coronaviruses are more stable in matrixes such as respiratory sputum.134 Methods for decontaminating N95 masks have been approved by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Researchers have identified fo ur methods capable of decontaminating N95 respirators while maintaining physical integrity (fit factor): UV radiation, heating to 70 \u00b0C, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP).151 Ethanol (70%) was associated with loss of physical integrity.151 Hydrogen peroxide vapor (VHP) can repeatedly decontaminat e N95 resp irators.374 Devices capable of decontaminating 80,000 ma sks per da y have been granted Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA.141 The FDA has iss ued an Eme rgency Use Authorization for a system capable of decontaminating ten N95 masks at a time using devices already present in many US hospitals.52 What do we need to know? Additional decontamination studies, particularly with regard to PPE and other items in short supply, are needed. What is the minimal contact time for disinfectants? Does contamination with human fluids/waste alter disinfectant efficacy profiles? How effect ive is air filtration at reducing transmission in healthcare, airplanes, and public spaces? Are landfills and wastewater treatment plants effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2? Is heat or UV decontamination effective to clean N95 masks, respirators and othe r types of PPE for multi -use? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 6/23/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 15 PPE - What PPE i s effective, and who should be using it? What do we know? The effectiveness of PPE for SARS -CoV-2 is currently unknown, and data from other related coronaviruses are used for guidance. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID -19, even with recommended PPE. Healthcare worker illnesses426 demonstrates human -to-human transmission despite isolation, PP E, and infection control.395 Risk of transmission to healthcare workers is high, with up to 20% of healthcare workers in Lombardy, Italy becoming infected.369 Over 50% of US healthcare workers infected with COVID -19 rep ort work in a healthcare setting as their single source of exposure.59 Hospital -acquired infection rates fell after introduction of comprehensi ve infection control measures, including expanded testing and use of PPE for all patient contacts.375 \"Healthcare personnel ent ering the room [of SARS -CoV-2 patients] should use standard precautions, contact pr ecautions, airborne precautions, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield).\"74 WHO indicates healthcare workers should wear clean long -sleeve gowns as well as gloves.462 Clothing and PPE that covers all skin may reduce exposure to pathogens.148, 453 Respirators ( NIOSH -certified N95, EUFFP2 or equivalent) are recommended for those dealing with possible aerosols.463 Additional protection, such as a Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) with a full hood, should be considered for high- risk pr ocedures (i.e., intubation, ventilation).55 Particular attention should be paid to the potential for transmission via exhaled air during supportive respiratory procedures.175 KN95 respirators are, under certain conditions, approved for use under FDA Emergency Use Authorization.142 On May 7, the FDA rescinded a number of KN95 models that no longer meet the EUA criteria and are no longer authorized.147 A study suggests that P100 respirators with removable filter cartridges have similar filtration efficiency compared to N95 respirators and could plausibly be used if N95 respirators were in shor t supply. The study used an experimental setup with aerosolized simulant, not human testing.349 Particul ar care should be taken with \"duckbill\" N95 respirators, which may fail fit tests after repeated doffing.124 Dom e- shaped N95 respirators also failed fit tests after extended u se.124 Masks may be effective at slowing transmission. On 4/3/2020, the US CDC recommended wearing cloth face masks in public where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.75 The WHO recommends that the general population wear non- medical masks when in public settings and when physical distancing is difficult, and that vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly) wear medical masks when clo se contact is likely.457 Infected individuals w earing facemasks in the home before the onset of symptoms was associated with a reduction in household transmissi on.448 Modeling suggests that widespread use of facemasks is effective at reducing transmission.325 A meta -analysis of SARS, MERS, and COVID -19 transmission events found evidence that wearing face masks and eye protection were each associated with lower risk of transmission.102 N95 respirators were associated with a larger reduction in transmission risk compared to surgical face masks.102 Physical distance (> 1 or 2 meters) was also associated with lower transmission risk.102 In a separ ate meta -analysis, N95 respirators were found to be beneficial for reducing the occurrence of respiratory illness in health care profess ionals including influenza, though surgical masks were similarly effective for influenza.332 N95 respirators were associated with large reductions (up to 80%) in SARS -CoV-1 infections.332 Surgical face masks, respirators and homemade face masks may prevent transmission of coronaviruses from infectious individuals (with or without symptoms) to other individuals.119, 253, 434 Surgical masks were associated with a significant reduction in the amount of seasonal coronavirus (not SARS -CoV-2) expressed as aerosol particles (<5 m) compared to not wearing a mask.253 The efficacy of homemade PPE, made with T -shirts, bandanas, or similar materials, is less than standard PPE, but may offer some protection i f no other options are available.103, 118, 371 The filtering efficiency of homemade mask materials is variable. Some non -standard materials (e.g., cotton, cotto n hybrids) may be able to filter out >90% of simulant particles >0.3 m,230 while other materi als (e.g., T -shirt, vacuum cleaner bag, towels) appear to have lower filtration efficacy (~35 -62%).446 What do we need to know? Most PPE recommendations have not been made on SARS -CoV-2 data, and comparative efficacy of different PPE for different tasks (e.g., intubation) is unknown. Identification of efficacious PPE for healthcare workers is critical due to their high rates of infection. What is the importance of aerosol transmission (particles <5 m)? What is the effective distance of spread via droplet or aerosol? How effectiv e are barriers such as N95 respirators or surgical masks for SARS -CoV-2? What is the appropriate PPE for first resp onders? Airport screeners? What are proper procedures for reducing spread and transmission rates in medical facilities?

REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 6/23/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 16 Forensics - Natural vs intentional use? Tests to be used f or attribution. What do we know? All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal spe cies. Genomic analysis places SARS -CoV-2 into the beta -coronavirus clade, with close relationship to bat coronaviruses. The SARS- CoV-2 virus is distinct from SARS -CoV-1 and MERS viruses.129 Genomic analysis suggests that SARS -CoV-2 is a natural variant and i s unlikely to be human- derived or otherwise created by \"recombination \" with other circulating strains of coronavirus.18, 515 Comparing genomes of multiple coronaviruses using machine -learning has identified key genomic signature s shared among high case fatality rate coronaviruses (SARS- CoV-1, SARS -CoV-2, MERS) and animal counterparts.178 These data further suggest that SAR S-CoV-2 emergence is the result of natural emergence and that there is a pot ential for future zoonotic transmission of additional pathogenic strains to humans.178 Genomic data support at leas t two plausible origins of SARS -CoV-2: \"(i) natural selection in a non -human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\"18 Both scenarios are consistent with the observed genetic changes found in all known SARS -CoV-2 isolate s. Some SARS- CoV-2 genomic evidence indicates a close relationship with pangolin coronaviruses,470 and data sugg est that pangolins may be a natural host for beta -coronaviruses.268, 270 Genomic evidence suggests a plausible recombination event between a circulating coronavirus in pangolins and bats could be the sour ce of SARS -CoV-2.482 Emerging studies are showing that bats are not the only reservoir of SARS -like coronaviruses.505 Additional research is needed. There are multiple studies showing that the SARS -CoV-2 S protein receptor binding domain, the portion of the protein responsible for binding the human receptor ACE2, was acquired through recombination between coronaviruses from pangolins and bats.19, 263, 269, 505 These studies suggest that pangolins may have play ed an intermediate role in the adaptation of SARS -CoV-2 to be able to bind to the human ACE2 receptor. Additional research is needed. A novel bat coronavirus (RmYN02) has been identified in China with an insertion in the viral furin cleavage site. While distinct from the insertion in SARS -CoV-2, thi s evidence shows that such insertions can occur naturally.514 Additionally, \"[...] SARS -CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone,\" red ucing the likelihood of laboratory originati on,18 and \"[...] genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS -CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, [though] it is currently impossible to prove or disprove th e other theories of its origin.\"18 Work with other coronaviruses has indicated that heparan sulfate dependence can be an indicator of prior cell passage, due to a mutation in the previous furin enzyme rec ognition motif.122 What do we n eed to know? Identifying the intermediate species between bats and humans would aid in reducing potential spillover from a natural source. Wide sampling of bats, other wild animals, and humans is needed to address the origin of SARS -CoV-2. What tests for attribution exist for coronavirus emergence? What is the identity of the intermediate species? Are there closely related circulating coronaviruses in bats or other animals with the novel PRRA cleavage site found in SARS -CoV-2? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 6/23/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 17 Genomics - How does the disease agent com pare to previous strains? What do we know? Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates substitutions and mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. Mutations and deletions in specific portions of the SARS -CoV-2 genome have not been linked to any changes in transmission or disease severity, though modeling work is attempting to identify possible chang es. There have been no documented cases of SARS -CoV-2 prior to December 2019. Preliminary genomic analyses, however, sugg est that the f irst human cases of SARS -CoV-2 emerged between 10/19/2019 - 12/17/2019.21, 35, 363 Analysis of more than 7,000 SARS -CoV-2 genome samples provides an estimated mutation rate of 6x10-4 nucleotides per genome per year.438 The same analysis estimates the emergence of SARS -CoV-2 in humans between October and December 2019.438 This aligns with the first known human cases in China in early D ecember 2019, in Europe in late December 2019,127 and circula tion in the US (Washington State) in February 2020.472 In both Ca lifornia126 and New York City,169 phylogenetic evidence supports multiple introductions of SARS -CoV-2 from both inside and outside the US. Despite evidence of variation in the genome80 and areas under posi tive selection,60 there are no known associations between particular mutations and changes in transmission or virulence.61 Thus, there is currently no evidence of distinct SARS- CoV-2 phenotypes at this time.287, 438 Research attempting to define clades or s ubgroups of SARS -CoV-2 based solely on genomic features has suffered from limited data496 and sampling bias.156 In 94 COVID -19 patients where both symptoms and genetic sequences of SARS -CoV-2 were know n, there was no association between viral genotype and clinical severity.506 Preliminary evidence suggests faster rates of transmission associated with a particular mutation, D614G, which is disproportionately represented in phylogenetic samples.232 However, it is difficult to determine whether this mutation is overreprese nted due to founder effects, or whether it truly spreads mor e rapidly than other isolates. Preliminary experimental evidence suggests that this mutation increases infectivity in cell lines, but additional animal model work is needed to confirm the effect o f this mutation on transmission. 503 Recent analysis of >16,000 genomes of SARS -CoV-2 suggests two major intro ductions in the US, one associated with the West coast and one with the Eastern portion of the US .319 A genome -wide association study in humans identified two loci corresponding to higher risk of severe COVID -19 (3p.21.31 and 9q34.2), including one associated with blood type.137 Individuals with type -O blood showed reduced risk of severe disease, while individuals with type -A blood showed an increased risk.137 SARS- CoV-2 is acquiring nucleotide changes at a rate that suggests the virus is undergoing pur ifying selection (that the genome is stabilizing toward a common genome).474 Low genetic divers ity early in the epidemic suggests that SARS -CoV-2 was capable of jumping to human and other mammalian hosts,474 and that additional jumps into humans from reservoir species may occur. Phylogenetic s suggest that SARS -CoV-2 is of bat origin, but is closely related to coronaviruses found in pangolin s.268, 270 The SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein, which mediates entry into host cells and is the major determinant of host range, is very similar to the SARS -CoV-1 Spike protein.281 The rest of the genome is more closely related to two separate bat281 and coronaviruses found in pangolin s.270 An a nalysis of SARS -CoV-2 sequences from Singapore has identified a large nucleotide (382 bp) deletion in ORF -8.415 In Arizona, re searchers identified an 81 -base pair deletion (removing 27 amino acids) in the ORF -7a protein, indicating that mutations can be detected by routine sentinel surveillance. The function of these deletions are unknown at this time.189 A recent report of virus mutation s within patients needs more research.223 Additional analysis of da ta suggests the results may be due to experimental methods.166, 487 Structural modeling suggests that observed changes in the genetic sequence of the SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein may enhance binding of the virus to human ACE2 receptors.336 More specifically, changes to two residues (Q493 and N501) are linked with improving the stability of the virus -receptor binding complex.336 Additionally, structural modeling identified several existing mutations that may enhance the stability of the receptor binding domain, potentially increasing b inding efficacy.338 Infectivity assays are needed to valida te the genotypic changes and possible phenotypic results identified in these studies. A key difference between SARS -CoV-2 and other beta -coronaviruses is the presence of a polybasic furin cleavage site in the Spike protein (insertion of PRRA amino acid s equence between S1 and S2).112 The US C DC is launching a national genomics consortium to assess SARS -CoV-2 genomic changes over time.70 What do we need to know? Research linking genetic changes to differences in phenotype (e.g., transmissibility, vir ulence, progression in patients) is needed. Are there similar genomic differences in the progression of coronavirus strains from bat to intermediate species to human? Are there different strains or clades of circulating virus? If so, do they differ in viru lence? What are the mutations in SARS -CoV-2 that allowed human infection and transmission?

Available at the state and nat ional level for the US.79 Hospital IQ has a dashboard that forecasts ho spital and ICU admissions for each county in the US. Relies in part on IHME forecasts.205 COVID Act Now: State and county -level das hboard focused on re -opening strategies, showing trends in four metrics related to COVID -19 risk (change in cases, total testing capacity, fraction of positive tests, and availability of ICU beds). Fundamentally uses an SEIR model fit to observed data.330 Researchers use a rolling window analysis incorporating uncertainty in the generation time distribution to estimate time - varying transmission rates in US states (the effective reproduction number, R eff or R t).8 What do we need to know ? Forecasts differ in how they handle public health interventions such as shelter -in-place orders and tracking how methods change in the near future will be important for understanding limitations going forward.
