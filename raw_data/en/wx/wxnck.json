With substantial investments in interventions to combat future outbreaks, it is hoped that Liberia is well prepared for a new incursion. We assessed the performance of the current EVD surveillance system in Liberia, focusing on its ability to promptly detect a new EVD outbreak.Methods We integrated WHO and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for public health surveillance system evaluation and used standardised indicators to measure system performance. We conducted 23 key informant interviews, 150 health facility assessment surveys and a standardised patient (SP) study (19 visits) from January 2020 to January 2021. Data were summarised and a gap analysis conducted.Results We found basic competencies of case detection and reporting necessary for a functional surveillance system were in place. At the higher (national, county and district) levels, we found performance gaps in 2 of 6 indicators relating to surveillance system structure, 3 of 14 indicators related to core functions, 1 of 5 quality indicators and 2 of 8 indicators related to support functions. The health facility assessment found performance gaps in 9 of 10 indicators related to core functions, 5 of 6 indicators related to support functions and 3 of 7 indicators related to quality. The SP simulations revealed large gaps between expected and actual practice in managing a patient warranting investigation for EVD. Major challenges affecting the system's operations across all levels included limited access to resources to support surveillance activities, persistent stock out of sample collection materials and attrition of trained staff.Conclusion The EVD surveillance system in Liberia may fail to promptly detect a new EVD outbreak. Specific improvements are required, and regular evaluations recommended. SP studies could be crucial in evaluating surveillance systems for rarely occurring diseases that are important to detect early. [Levels and determinants of overprescribing of antibiotics in the public and private primary care sectors in South Africa](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/7/e012374?rss=1) Although overprovision of antibiotics in primary care is a key driver of antibiotic resistance, little is known about its determinants in low-income and middle-income countries. Patient demand and financial incentives for providers are often held responsible for overprovision. Yet, inadequate provision exists in their absence and could be fuelled by quality of care issues and incorrect beliefs of providers regarding patients' expectations. We explored these issues in the private and public sector in South Africa, by conducting a cross-sectional study using standardised patients (SPs)\u2014healthy individuals trained to portray a scripted clinical case to providers\u2014presenting with symptoms of a viral respiratory infection in a sample of public and private sector clinics. We linked data from SP visits to rich survey data to compare the practices and their predictors in the two sectors. Unnecessary rates of antibiotics were similarly high in the public (78%) and private sector (67%), but private providers prescribed more antibiotics at higher risk of resistance development. In the private sector, overprescription of antibiotics diminished when consultations were more thorough, but increased for consultations scheduled later in the day, suggesting contrasting effects for provider effort and decision fatigue. We observed differences in beliefs that could be responsible for overprescription: in the public sector, a majority of providers (nurses) wrongly believed that antibiotics would help the patient recover more quickly. In the private sector, a majority of doctors thought patients would not come back if they did not receive antibiotics. Overall, this evidence suggests that different factors may be responsible for the high overprescribing rates of antibiotics in the public and private sectors. Tailored stewardship interventions are urgently needed that tackle providers' engrained habits and incorrect beliefs. [Ethical priorities for international collaborative adaptive platform trials for public health emergencies](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/7/e012930?rss=1) [Excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic during the 2020 and 2021 waves in Antananarivo, Madagascar](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/7/e011801?rss=1) COVID-19-associated mortality remains difficult to estimate in sub-Saharan Africa because of the lack of comprehensive systems of death registration. Based on death registers referring to the capital city of Madagascar, we sought to estimate the excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic and calculate the loss of life expectancy.Methods Death records between 2016 and 2021 were used to estimate weekly excess mortality during the pandemic period. To infer its synchrony with circulation of SARS-CoV-2, a cross-wavelet analysis was performed. Life expectancy loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic was calculated by projecting mortality rates using the Lee and Carter model and extrapolating the prepandemic trends (1990-2019). Differences in life expectancy at birth were disaggregated by cause of death.Results Peaks of excess mortality in 2020-21 were associated with waves of COVID-19. Estimates of all-cause excess mortality were 38.5 and 64.9 per 100 000 inhabitants in 2020 and 2021, respectively, with excess mortality reaching 50% over 6 weeks. In 2021, we quantified a drop of 0.8 and 1.0 years in the life expectancy for men and women, respectively attributable to increased risks of death beyond the age of 60 years.Conclusion We observed high excess mortality during the pandemic period, in particular around the peaks of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in Antananarivo. Our study highlights the need to implement death registration systems in low-income countries to document true toll of a pandemic. [WHO Global Situational Alert System: a mixed methods multistage approach to identify country-level COVID-19 alerts](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/7/e012241?rss=1) Globally, since 1 January 2020 and as of 24 January 2023, there have been over 664 million cases of COVID-19 and over 6.7 million deaths reported to WHO. WHO developed an evidence-based alert system, assessing public health risk on a weekly basis in 237 countries, territories and areas from May 2021 to June 2022. This aimed to facilitate the early identification of situations where healthcare capacity may become overstretched.Methods The process involved a three-stage mixed methods approach. In the first stage, future deaths were predicted from the time series of reported cases and deaths to produce an initial alert level. In the second stage, this alert level was adjusted by incorporating a range of contextual indicators and accounting for the quality of information available using a Bayes classifier. In the third stage, countries with an alert level of 'High' or above were added to an operational watchlist and assistance was deployed as needed.Results Since June 2021, the system has supported the release of more than US$27 million from WHO emergency funding, over 450 000 rapid antigen diagnostic testing kits and over 6000 oxygen concentrators. Retrospective evaluation indicated that the first two stages were needed to maximise sensitivity, where 44% (IQR 29%-67%) of weekly watchlist alerts would not have been identified using only reported cases and deaths. The alerts were timely and valid in most cases; however, this could only be assessed on a non-representative sample of countries with hospitalisation data available.Conclusions The system provided a standardised approach to monitor the pandemic at the country level by incorporating all available data on epidemiological analytics and contextual assessments. While this system was developed for COVID-19, a similar system could be used for future outbreaks and emergencies, with necessary adjustments to parameters and indicators. [The global health and care worker compact: evidence base and policy considerations](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/7/e012337?rss=1) During the COVID-19 pandemic, and recognising the sacrifice of health and care workers alongside discrimination, violence, poor working conditions and other violations of their rights, health and safety, in 2021 the World Health Assembly requested WHO to develop a global health and care worker compact, building on existing normative documentation, to provide guidance to 'protect health and care workers and safeguard their rights'.Methods A review of existing international law and other normative documents was conducted. We manually searched five main sets of international instruments: (1) International Labour Organization conventions and recommendations; (2) WHO documents; (3) United Nations (UN) human rights treaties and related documents; (4) UN Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and (5) the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols. We included only legal or other normative documents with a global or regional focus directly addressing or relevant to health and care workers or workers overall.Results More than 70 documents met our search criteria. Collectively, they fell into four domains, within which we identified 10 distinct areas: (1) preventing harm, encompassing (A) occupational hazards, (B) violence and harassment and (C) attacks in situations of fragility, conflict and violence; (2) inclusivity, encompassing (A) non-discrimination and equality; (3) providing support, encompassing (A) fair and equitable remuneration, (B) social protection and (C) enabling work environments and (4) safeguarding rights, encompassing (A) freedom of association and collective bargaining and (B) whistle-blower protections and freedom from retaliation.Discussion A robust legal and policy framework exists for supporting health and care workers and safeguarding their rights. Specific human rights, the right to health overall, and other binding and non-binding legal documents provide firm grounding for the compact. However, these existing commitments are not being fully met. Implementing the compact will require more effective governance mechanisms and new policies, in partnership with health and care workers themselves. [Substantial increase in stillbirth rate during the COVID-19 pandemic: results from a population-based study in the Indian state of Bihar](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/7/e013021?rss=1) We report on the stillbirth rate (SBR) and associated risk factors for births during the COVID-19 pandemic, and change in SBR between prepandemic (2016) and pandemic periods in the Indian state of Bihar.Methods Births between July 2020 and June 2021 (91.5% participation) representative of Bihar were listed. Stillbirth was defined as fetal death with gestation period of 7 months where the fetus did not show any sign of life. Detailed interviews were conducted for all stillbirths and neonatal deaths, and for 25% random sample of surviving live births. We estimated overall SBR, and during COVID-19 peak and non-peak periods per 1000 births. Multiple logistic regression models were run to assess risk factors for stillbirth. The change in SBR for Bihar from 2016 to 2020-2021 was estimated.Results We identified 582 stillbirths in 30 412 births with an estimated SBR of 19.1 per 1000 births (95% CI 17.7 to 20.7); SBR was significantly higher in private facility (38.4; 95% CI 34.3 to 43.0) than in public facility (8.6; 95% CI 7.3 to 10.1) births, and for COVID-19 peak (21.2; 95% CI 19.2 to 23.4) than non-peak period (16.3; 95% CI 14.2 to 18.6) births. Pregnancies with the last pregnancy trimester during the COVID-19 peak period had 40.4% (95% CI 10.3% to 70.4%) higher SBR than those who did not. Risk factor associations for stillbirths were similar between the COVID-19 peak and non-peak periods, with gestation age of <8 months with the highest odds of stillbirth followed by referred deliveries and deliveries in private health facilities. A statistically significant increase of 24.3% and 68.9% in overall SBR and intrapartum SBR was seen between 2016 and 2020-2021, respectively.Conclusions This study documented an increase in SBR during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared with the prepandemic period, and the varied SBR based on the intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic and by the place of delivery. [The inclusion of diagnostics in national health insurance schemes in Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines and Viet Nam](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/7/e012512?rss=1) The Lancet Commission on Diagnostics highlighted a huge gap in access to diagnostic testing even for basic tests, particularly at the primary care level, and emphasised the need for countries to include diagnostics as part of their universal health coverage benefits packages. Despite the poor state of diagnostic-related services in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), little is known about the extent to which diagnostics are included in the health benefit packages. We conducted an analysis of seven Asian LMICs\u2014Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Viet Nam\u2014to understand this issue. We conducted a targeted review of relevant literature and applied a health financing framework to analyse the benefit packages available in each government-sponsored scheme. We found considerable heterogeneity in country approaches to diagnostics. Of the seven countries, only India has developed a national essential diagnostics list. No country presented a clear policy rationale on the inclusion of diagnostics in their scheme and the level of detail on the specific diagnostics which are covered under the schemes was also generally lacking. Government-sponsored insurance expansion in the eligible populations has reduced the out-of-pocket health payment burden in many of the countries but overall, there is a lack of access, availability and affordability for diagnostic-related services. [Caught in the crossfires: the Virchow Prize, its inaugural winner, and the quest to decolonise global health](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/7/e013272?rss=1) [Cost-effectiveness of community-based distribution of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy in Madagascar, Mozambique, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of Congo](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/7/e010238?rss=1) Malaria in pregnancy is a major driver of maternal and infant mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. The WHO recommends the administration of intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) at antenatal care (ANC) visits. Despite being a highly cost-effective strategy, IPTp-SP coverage and uptake remains low. A pilot project was conducted to assess the cost-effectiveness (CE) of community-based delivery of IPTp (C-IPTp) in addition to ANC delivery to increase IPTp uptake in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Madagascar (MDG), Mozambique (MOZ) and Nigeria (NGA).Methods Costs and CE estimates of C-IPTp were calculated according to two scenarios: (1) costs in 'programmatic mode' (ie, costs if C-IPTp was to be implemented by national health systems) and (2) costs from the pilot project. The effectiveness of C-IPTp was obtained through estimates of the averted disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) associated with maternal clinical malaria and anaemia, low birth weight and neonatal mortality.Results Net incremental costs of C-IPTp US$5552-US$31 552 (MDG), US$10 202-US$53 221 (MOZ) and US$667-US$28 645 (NGA) per 1000 pregnant women, under scenarios (1) and (2), respectively. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranged between US$15-US$119 in DRC, US$9-US$53 in MDG, US$104-US$543 in MOZ and US$2-US$66 in NGA per DALY averted, under scenarios (1) and (2), respectively. ICERs fall below the WHO recommended CE threshold based on the gross domestic product per capita.Conclusion Findings suggest that C-IPTp is a highly cost-effective intervention. Results can inform policy decisions on adopting and optimising effective interventions for preventing malaria in pregnancy. [War-related sexual and gender-based violence in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia: a community-based study](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/7/e010270?rss=1) Sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) during armed conflicts has serious ramifications with women and girls disproportionally affected. The impact of the conflict that erupted in November 2020 in Tigray on SGBV is not well documented. This study is aimed at assessing war-related SGBV in war-affected Tigray, Ethiopia.Methods A community-based survey was conducted in 52 (out of 84) districts of Tigray, excluding its western zone and some districts bordering Eritrea due to security reasons. Using a two-stage multistage cluster sampling technique, a total of 5171 women of reproductive age (15-49 years) were randomly selected and included in the study. Analysis used weighted descriptive statistics, regression modelling and tests of associations.Results Overall, 43.3% (2241/5171) of women experienced at least one type of gender-based violence. The incidents of sexual, physical and psychological violence, and rape among women of reproductive age were found to be 9.7% (500/5171), 28.6% (1480/5171), 40.4% (2090/5171) and 7.9% (411/5171), sexual violence survivors, rape accounted for 82.2% (411/500) cases, of which 68.4% (247) reported being gang raped. Young women (aged 15-24 years) were the most affected by sexual violence, 29.2% (146/500). Commonly reported SGBV-related issues were physical trauma, 23.8% sexually transmitted infections, (68/411), HIV depression 19.2% (431/2241). Most survivors (89.7%) did not receive any postviolence medical or psychological support.Conclusions Systemic war-related SGBV was prevalent in Tigray, with gang-rape as the most common form of sexual violence. Immediate medical and psychological care, and long-term rehabilitation and community support for survivors are urgently needed and recommended. [Implementation research for developing Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) Systems: lessons from Indonesia](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/7/e012358?rss=1) Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) systems are the optimal source for data on births, deaths and causes of death for health policy, programme evaluation and research. In Indonesia, indicators such as life expectancy at birth, childhood and maternal mortality rates and cause-specific death rates need to be routinely monitored for national health policy. However, the CRVS system is not yet producing reliable vital statistics, which creates a challenge for evidence-based health action. In 2019, the Indonesian government released a national strategy for the CRVS system, with targets for improved coverage and data quality by 2024. This article describes findings from a programme of formative and implementation research to guide the application of the national strategy. At first, a detailed CRVS assessment and gap analysis were undertaken using an international framework. The assessment findings were used to develop a revised business process model for reporting deaths and their causes at village, subdistrict and district level. In addition, a field instruction manual was also developed to guide personnel in implementation. Two field sites in Java\u2014Malang District and Kudus Regency were selected for pilot testing the reporting procedures, and relevant site preparation and training were carried out. Data compilations for Malang in 2019 and Kudus in 2020 were analysed to derive mortality indicators. High levels of death reporting completeness (83% to 89%) were reported from both districts, along with plausible cause-specific mortality profiles, although the latter need further validation. The study findings establish the feasibility of implementing revised death reporting procedures at the local level, as well as demonstrate sustainability through institutionalisation and capacity building, and can be used to accelerate further development of the CRVS system in Indonesia. [Retracing loss of momentum for primary health care: can renewed political interest in the context of COVID-19 be a turning point?](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/7/e012668?rss=1) The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed major weaknesses in primary health care (PHC), and how such weaknesses pose a catastrophic threat to humanity. As a result, strengthening PHC has re-emerged as a global health priority and will take centre stage at the 2023 United Nations High Level Meeting (UNHLM) on Universal Health Coverage (UHC). In this analysis, we examine why, despite its fundamental importance and incredible promise, the momentum for PHC has been lost over the years. The portrayal of PHC itself (policy image) and the dominance of global interests has undermined the attractiveness of intended PHC reforms, leading to legacy historical policy choices (critical junctures) that have become extremely difficult to dismantle, even when it is clear that such choices were a mistake. PHC has been a subject of several political declarations, but post-declarative action has been weak. The COVID-19 provides a momentous opportunity under which the image of PHC has been reconstructed in the context of health security, breaking away from the dominant social justice paradigms. However, we posit that effective PHC investments are those that are done under calm conditions, particularly through political choices that prioritise the needs of the poor who continue to face a crisis even in non-pandemic situations. In the aftermath of the 2023 UNHLM on UHC, country commitment should be evaluated based on the technical and financial resources allocated to PHC and tangible deliverables as opposed to the formulation of documents or convening of a gathering that simply (re) endorses the concept. [Using routine health data to evaluate the impact of indoor residual spraying on malaria transmission in Madagascar](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/7/e010818?rss=1) Indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) are cornerstone malaria prevention methods in Madagascar. This retrospective observational study uses routine data to evaluate the impacts of IRS overall, sustained IRS exposure over multiple years and level of spray coverage (structures sprayed/found) in nine districts where non-pyrethroid IRS was deployed to complement standard pyrethroid ITNs from 2017 to 2020.Methods Multilevel negative-binomial generalised linear models were fit to estimate the effects of IRS exposure overall, consecutive years of IRS exposure and spray coverage level on monthly all-ages population-adjusted malaria cases confirmed by rapid diagnostic test at the health facility level. The study period extended from July 2016 to June 2021. Facilities with missing data and non-geolocated communes were excluded. Facilities in IRS districts were matched with control facilities by propensity score analysis. Models were controlled for ITN survivorship, mass drug administration coverage, precipitation, enhanced vegetation index, seasonal effects and district. Predicted cases under a counterfactual no IRS scenario and number of cases averted by IRS were estimated using the fitted models.Results Exposure to IRS overall reduced case incidence by an estimated 30.3% from 165.8 cases per 1000 population (95% CI=139.7 to 196.7) under a counterfactual no IRS scenario, to 114.3 (95% CI=96.5 to 135.3) over 12 months post-IRS campaign in nine districts. A third year of IRS reduced malaria cases 30.9% more than a first year (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=0.578, 95% CI=0.578 to 0.825, p<0.001) (IRR=0.733, 95% CI=0.611 to 0.878, p=0.001). There was no significant difference between the first and second year (p>0.05). Coverage of 86%-90% was associated with a 19.7% reduction in incidence (IRR=0.803, 95% CI=0.690 to 0.934, p=0.005) compared with coverage 85%, although these results were not robust to sensitivity analysis.Conclusion This study demonstrates that non-pyrethroid IRS appears to substantially reduce malaria incidence in Madagascar and that sustained implementation of IRS over three years confers additional benefits. [Improving access to medicines and beyond: the national volume-based procurement policy in China](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/7/e011535?rss=1) . Since 2019, the Chinese central government has taken significant steps to centralize national purchasing power and has implemented a pooled procurement system. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of China's National Volume-Based Procurement (NVBP) policy, which represents a unique approach to pooled procurement within the pharmaceutical sector. The primary objectives of the NVBP are to reduce drug prices, enhance access to affordable medications, and improve the overall functioning of the pharmaceutical industry in China. Our analysis delves into the key features of the NVBP, including its centralized procurement system, volume-based procurement approach, and the guaranteed procurement volumes allocated to winning bidders. We also address the challenges and implications associated with the NVBP, such as its impact on the pharmaceutical industry, the sustainability of price reductions, and the importance of striking a balance between price reduction and industry sustainability. Through a comparative analysis, we shed light on the distinct characteristics of China's approach to pooled procurement and its potential ramifications for healthcare policies and practices. By examining the NVBP within the broader context of China's evolving healthcare landscape, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of the implications and effectiveness of this unique policy initiative. [Estimating the economic burden of long-Covid: the additive cost of healthcare utilisation among COVID-19 Israel](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/7/e012588?rss=1) Postacute sequelae resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infections (LONG-COVID) have been reported. The resulting added economic burden from the perspective of healthcare organisations is not clear. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the additive healthcare costs among COVID-19 recoverees, in a large community-dwelling general population, as incurred by an insurer-provider organisation over time.Methods In this historical cohort study, cost data from Clalit Health Services (CHS) were analysed. The primary endpoint was the direct cost incurred by CHS per month per person. Costs were measured for COVID-19 recoverees and matched controls, from January 2019 to January 2022. Difference in differences (DiDs) were calculated as the difference in mean monthly costs in cases and controls in the post-COVID-19 individual period, deducing their cost difference in a prepandemic 12 months baseline period.Results Among N=642 868 community-dwelling COVID-19 recoverees, 268 948 (40.8%) were 0-19 years old and 63 051 (9.6%) were 60 years or older. A total of 16 017 (2.5%) of recoverees had been hospitalised during the acute phase of the COVID-19 disease. Costs in cases and controls converged after 16 months from recovery. The mean monthly cost incurred by CHS per COVID-19 recoverees over up to 15 months (mean: 8.25) of post-COVID-19 follow-up was higher by 8.2% (US$8.2) compared with matched controls. The excess cost attributable to post-COVID-19 effects (DID) was 7.6% of the cost in controls (US$7.7 per patient per month). Both net and relative DIDs were substantially higher in patients who required hospitalisation during the acute phase of COVID-19 and in older adults. Excess in hospitalisations, primary care physicians and medical specialists' visits-related costs were observed.Conclusions Long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infections translate into excess healthcare costs, months after recovery, hence requiring adjustments of funds allocation. These excess costs gradually diminish after recoveree, returning to baseline differences 16 months after recoveree. [An analysis of WHOs Temporary Recommendations on international travel and trade measures during Public Health Emergencies of International Concern](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/7/e012615?rss=1) During Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEICs), The International Health Regulations (IHR) require the WHO to issue Temporary Recommendations on the use of international travel and trade measures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO's initial recommendation against 'any travel or trade restriction' has been questioned, and virtually all countries subsequently used international travel measures. WHO's Recommendations to States Parties also changed over the course of the pandemic. There is a need to understand how WHO's treatment of this issue compared with other PHEICs and why States Parties' actions diverged from WHO's initial Recommendations. This first analysis of WHO's Temporary Recommendations on international travel and trade measures during all seven PHEICs compares the guidance for clarity and consistency in several areas of substance and process. We find that lack of clarity and inconsistency in WHO guidance makes it difficult to interpret and relate back to IHR obligations. Based on this analysis, we offer recommendations to increase consistency and clarity of WHO's guidance on this issue during global health emergencies. "}
