I was deeply inspired by herbal lore and the plant kingdom's amazing ability to directly impact our health, consciousness, and way of being in the world. An often overlooked aspect of herbal medicine is the origin of the herbs that are prescribed. As an integral part of my efforts to maintain a sustainable clinic I am committed to, whenever possible, prescribing organic formulas from local farms. I have created my own line of oils, tinctures and other herbal formulas which I grow in the clinic garden at Aerie and our sister farm, Dragon's Back, in Mendocino. By involving myself in the entire process of creation - including growing, cultivating, harvesting, and processing herbs, - I am able to practice herbal medicine with a deep connection to the spirit of the plants I work with. People have the opportunity to experience the herbs that are growing in the clinic gardens and be introduced to the process of local medicinal farming in its truest sense. Herbal Medicine \"A thousand gold stars for Bronwyn, for her grace and kindness...and her vast body of esoteric knowledge to draw on. What a spectacular medicine woman!\" ~Anna D. San Francisco, CA What to Expect Herbs have a direct impact on the body's chemistry and are an integral part of natural and Chinese medicine due to their high concentration of nutrients, amino acids and special blood tonics. Because of this, herbs have been used as natural medicine for thousands of years and are steeped in a rich and ancient medical tradition. Chinese herbal medicine relies on a complex system of herbal formulas in which herbs are grouped together in carefully constructed collections to treat disharmonies in the body. Herbal medicine is often used in conjunction with acupuncture treatments. Herbs are very effective in sustaining the effects of acupuncture treatments and can be used to prolong the gaps between sessions. Additionally, there are specific dis-harmonies that are especially successfully when treated using a combination of herbal medicine and acupuncture.
