The spaces in the mouth, nose, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, abdomen, thorax, capillaries, etc. Effecting Human Physiology Air : All movements involve Air as an element. The nature of the elements themselves determine the nature of physiology. With the human body Air is present in the pulsations of the heart, lungs etc. Effecting Human Physiology Fire : The source of Fire and light in the solar system is the sun. In the human body, the source of Fire is metabolism. Fire works in the digestive system as well as in the gray matter of the brain, where Fire manifests as intelligence. Fire also activates the retina to perceive light. Therefore body temperature, digestion, thinking etc are all the functions of the Fire. Effecting Human Physiology Water: It manifests in the body as the secretions of digestive juices, in the mucous membranes and in plasma and cytoplasm. Water is vital for the functioning of all the systems of the body. For example, dehydration resulting from diarrhea and vomiting is due to water element.

MANAS (Mind) : Supreme Indriya that controls all Indriyas Has three abstract qualities - 'Sattva', 'Rajas' and 'Tamas'. The Four Components of Life 4. ATMA (Soul/Self) : Param Atma : Supreme, immortal pure has only Sattva, free of happiness or sorrow. Jiv Atma : resides in living body attached to Rajas and Tamas, witness every function & emotion throughout the life. Tridosha Ayurveda is based on 3 energies. Their balanced state is health and imbalance disease. VATA - the kinetic energy, movement, division, growth, etc. PITTA - the thermal energy, heat generation, intellect,sight, etc. KAPHA - the potential energy are Vata, Pitta & Kapha Tridosha concept is applicable in living organisms Tridoshas are biological entities responsible for structure, function and behaviour dimensions of all living organisms Therefore human body mind constitution (Prakriti), diseases, Medicines and Food all has been categorized in Vata type, Pitta type and Kapha type. But nothing is absolute pure; every thing is permutation and combination of Tridoshas Concept of Sapta Dhatus ( 7 Body Tissues) Body is made up of Seven Tissues and their function is to maintain the body matrix 1. Rasa 5. Asthi (Plasma) (Bones) 2. Rakta 6. Majja (Blood) (Bone marrow) 3. Mansa 7. Shukra (Muscles) (Reproductive tissues) 4. Medas (Fats) Ojas (Responsible for Immunity) Concept of Prakriti (Body Mind Constitution and Temperament) Concept of Prakriti (human constitution) is related to physiological attributes to health and disease.
