This field integrates literary, performing, visual arts, and design into healthcare and public health contexts. Research indicates that the integration of the arts into our health systems can improve both individual and population-level health measures and outcomes Around the world, the international arts in health movement represents a rediscovery of the links between body, mind, and spirit\u2014and of the power of interdisciplinary collaboration between the creative and medical arts. Arts in health recognizes and advocates the role of imagination and creativity in developing and maintaining health. Arts in health professionals provide patients, family members, caregivers, and other health-related populations with opportunities for creative expression when they need it most. Similarly, artists partner with public health professionals and community leaders to create a culture of health. Learn more about the field by visiting [What is Arts in Medicine?](https://arts.ufl.edu/academics/center-for-arts-in-medicine/about/what-is-arts-in-medicine/) Artists in health and arts therapies play distinct and complementary roles in a healthcare setting. An artist in residence in a healthcare setting is a practicing, professional artist in an artistic discipline such as visual art, music, dance, theatre or writing. An arts therapist is a mental health professional who utilizes an artistic discipline for a psychotherapeutic purpose. The expertise of an arts in health professional is to facilitate a creative process using their artistic discipline in a healthcare or community setting. The expertise of an arts therapist (i.e. dance therapy, art therapy, drama therapy, or music therapy) is to assess, treat and evaluate an individual using their artistic discipline of training to facilitate a psychotherapy session. The primary distinction between the two disciplines of the Arts Therapies in contrast to Arts in Health, also known as Arts in Medicine, is the objective of engaging a patient, loved one, or clinician. An arts therapist engages a client for therapeutic goals and objectives serving as an integrated, interdisciplinary healthcare practitioner. An arts in health professional engages an individual for the purpose of making art together to enhance health and uplift the body, mind and spirit through the experience of making art. While an arts in health professional such as an artist in residence is also an integrated team member in a healthcare setting, they do not serve the healthcare team in a clinical capacity nor do they make mental health assessments or set psychotherapeutic objectives. An artist in residence has the clear and pure task of facilitating creative process; and making art. The arts therapist establishes therapeutic goals with the client; and continually engages the creative process with the aim of meeting stated goals. These same distinctions hold true in a community setting or in public health settings where an arts in health professional may also engage the public in creative experiences for the purpose of enhancing wellness or communicating health messages. Both fields, Arts in Health, and the Arts Therapies are complementary and necessary for preserving and creating healthy communities.

A Graduate Certificate is a recognition of the acquisition of knowledge and skills in a given field of study. A Graduate Certificate is an academic credential granted by the University of Florida. As such, all Graduate Certificates must follow the requirements of admission, successful completion of approved graduate-level coursework, application to receive the credential, and enrollment during the term in which the certificate is awarded and posted to the transcript. The field of arts in health, also known as arts in medicine, does not have any legal/official licensing, certification, or accrediting requirements at this time. Rather, a Graduate Certificate from the University of Florida serves as a valuable credential proving your advanced study in this field to employers, partners, funders, and participants. A Graduate Certificate will provide you with valuable experience to advance or develop your arts in medicine or arts in public health practices. Our graduate program is originally designed to be fully online. The Center intentionally chooses to teach online as the best way to allow students to stay embedded in their current communities. By learning remotely, students can begin to develop their creative practice and careers right away without the need to relocate. Our courses are asynchronous meaning there are no set course meeting times; learning happens any time, anywhere. Deadlines for course assignments and weekly discussion boards can be found in the [syllabus](https://arts.ufl.edu/syllabi/) at the beginning of each semester. The University of Florida uses Canvas as its e-learning platform. Canvas is the standard LMS (learning management system) use by most institutions of higher learning. Students have 24/7 access to courses through their Canvas dashboard. Each 8-week or 16-week course includes: Each assignment comes with its own preset deadlines as listed in the syllabus at the beginning of each term. Students are responsible for learning materials each week that are available 24/7 and completing assignments according to weekly deadlines. Assignments include regular creative practice, weekly discussion boards, academic essays, and presentations. Students also have full-access to Office 365, Microsoft Teams collaboration software, and thousands of scientific, academic, and arts journals through the UF libraries online. While courses are completely asynchronous and there are no required \"class meeting times,\" there are extra-curriculuar opportunities to attend live presentations, networking, orientation, graduation, and other events online or in-person will be made regularly available to our students and alumni. Bi-weekly phone calls with faculty are included in the practicum course. Students may also choose to interact with other students via phone or Skype during group projects. These are scheduled with student availability in mind. Students in practicum or capstone courses will also schedule themselves to complete hands-on practice in their local communities at a site of their choosing which will require a consistent weekly time commitment during those semesters. The Graduate Practicum requires all of our students (MA or GC) to undertake 12 weeks of hands-on arts in health work with a population of interest at a physical, or virtual, self-selected site. The goal of the practicum is for students to apply the knowledge of arts in health gained during the first semester; including academic theory, history, and evidence along with an understanding of professional proficiencies. Student enter the course with a fully devloped proposal to integrate the arts into a healthcare, or communitybased, handson practice. Students are expected to choose their own site(s) and act as a facilitator or overseer of arts activities within the Practicum. Onsite practicum activities may include facilitation of individual or group art activities, public performances or events, or other arts activities as proposed by the student and approved by the Center for Arts in Medicine (CAM) faculty, course instructor, and onsite supervisor. The AIM Graduate Practicum course runs over 16 weeks. The practicum hours should be completed over 12 weeks. Students should plan to begin the handson practicum work facilitating the arts to participants at the site no later than the fourth week of the course. Praciticum students develop and implement hands-on arts in health programming in their own communities. #RealWorldExperience The Capstone course requires students (MA only) to design their own final research or evaluation project; a hands-on learning experience that serves as the culmination of the Master of Arts (MA) in Arts in Medicine degree. The Capstone includes a project that students undertake and an assessment of that project, which can be either research or evaluation. In the capstone, students may choose to take an active role as an artist facilitator or they may take a more administrative role as a project director. The Capstone course will span 16 weeks, including completion of the final paper. Prior to undertaking the Capstone, students register for the Capstone Proposal course. During that eight-week course, students develop the Capstone plan, undertake an exhaustive literature review, and write the Capstone Proposal. They then typically have eight weeks before beginning to work on details of their plan, which may require IRB approval if human research is undertaken. While the MA in Arts in Medicine is a nonthesis degree program, the Capstone is equivalent to a thesis in that it asks students to undertake a significant project and conduct an equally significant assessment of that project. Within the Capstone Proposal and Capstone courses, students enjoy tremendous support from faculty and peers. At the completion of Capstone, students have prepared themselves to achieve their professional goals. Final Capstone papers are retained in the UF Libraries. Capstone students develop and implement a research study or evaluation of arts in health programming. #RealWorldResearch Fall Cohort Deadline: MA or GC Arts in Medicine applicants starting in the Fall (August), must submit by May 1. The early-decision deadline is March 15. Spring Cohort Deadline: MA or GC applicants starting in the Spring (January), must submit by October 1. The early-decision deadline is August 15.
