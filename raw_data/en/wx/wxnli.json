The Arizona D epartm ent of Health Services is distributing this updated version of the Zebra Manual to assist you in responding properly to a possible patient exposure to such an agent. The m edical school adage, \"when you hear hoof beats, think horses, not zebras\" has a new twist in this age of threats of bioterrorism . W e can lear n how to recognize a zebra among the horses by increasing our awareness of the clin ical syndro mes associated with each potential b ioterro agent. This enhanced Zebra Manual contains fact shee ts, diagnostic guidelines, and infection control inform ation for all Category \"A\" and \"B\" biological ag ents, as well as extensive sm allpox inform ation.

Physicians should report noticeable increases in unusual illnesses, symptom complexes, or disease patterns (even without definitive diagnosis) to public health authorities. Prompt reporting of unusual patterns of illness can allow public health officials to initiate an epidemiologic investigation earlier than would be possible if the report awaited definitive etiologic diagnosis. If you suspect an unusual disease or possible outbreak, please call your state or local health department.

Report Summary Public Health Assessment of Potential Biological Terrorism Agents As part of a Congressional initia- tive begun in 1999 to upgrade national public health capab ilities for response to acts of biological terrorism, theCenters for Diseas e Control and Pre- vention (CDC) was designated thelead agency for overall public healthplanning. A Bioter rorism Prepared- ness and Response Office has beenformed to help target several areas forinitial preparedness activities, includ-ing planning, improved surveillanceand epidemiologic capabilities, rapid laboratory diagnostics, enhanced com-munications, and medical therapeu-tics stockpiling (1). To focus thesepreparedness efforts, however, thebiological agents towards which the efforts should be targeted had to firstbe formally identified and placed inpriority order. Many biological agentscan cause illness in humans, but not allare capable of affecting public healthand medical infrastructures on a largescale. The military has formally assessed multiple agents for their strategic use-fulness on the battlefield (2). In addi-tion, the Working Group on CivilianBiodefense, using an expert panel con-sensus-based process, has identifiedseveral biological agents as potentialhigh-impact agents against civilian populations (3-7). To guide nationalpublic health bioterrorism prepared-ness and response efforts, a methodwas sought for assessing potential bio-logical threat agen ts meansfor standardized ev aluations of these threats. In June 1999, a meeting of national experts was convened to 1)review potential general criteria forselecting the biological agents thatpose the greatest threats to civiliansand 2) review lists of previously iden-tified biological threat agents andapply these criteria to identify whichshould be evaluated further and priori-tized for public health preparednessefforts. This report outlines the overallselection and prioritization processused to determine the biologicalagents for public health preparednessactivities. Identifying these priorityagents will help facilitate coordinatedplanning efforts among federal agen-cies, state and local emergencyresponse and public health agencies,and the medical community. Overview of Agent Selection and Prioritization Process On June 3-4, 1999, academic infectious disease experts, nationalpublic health experts, Department ofHealth and Human Services agencyrepresentatives, civilian and militaryintelligence experts, and law enforce-ment officials 1 met to review and comment on the th reat potential of various agents to civilian populations.The following general areas were usedas criteria: 1) public health impactbased on illness and death; 2) deliverypotential to large populations based onstability of the agent, ability to massproduce and distribute a virulentagent, and potential for person-to-per-son transmission of the agent; 3) pub-lic perception as related to public fearand potential civil disruption; and 4)special public health preparednessneeds stockpile surv eillance, or diag- nostic needs. Participants reviewedlists of biological warfare or potentialbiological threat agents and selectedthose they felt posed the greatestthreat to civilian populations. The following unclassified docu- ments containing potential biologicalthreat agents were reviewed: 1) theSelect Agent Rule list, 2) the Austra-lian Group List for Biological Agentsfor Export Control, 3) the unclassifiedmilitary list of biological warfareagents, 4) the Biological WeaponsConvention list, and 5) the WorldHealth Organization Biological Weap-ons list (8-12). Participants withappropriate clearance levels reviewedintelligence information regardingclassified suspected biological agentthreats to civilian populations. Geneti-cally engineered or recombinant bio-logical agents were considered but notincluded for final prioritizationbecause of the inabili ty to predict the nature of these agents and thus iden-tify specific prepared ness activities for public health and medical response tothem. In addition, no information wasavailable about the likelihood for useof one biological agent over another.This aspect, therefore, could not beconsidered in the final evaluation ofthe potential biological threat agents. Participants discussed and identi- fied agents they felt had the potential 1Participants are listed in Acknowledg- ments.NEWS & NOTES 226 Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 8, No. 2, February 2002for high impact based on subjective assessments in the four general cate-gories. After the meeting, CDC per-sonnel then attempted to identifyobjective indicators in each category that could be used to further defineand prioritize the identified high-impact agents and provide a frame-work for an objective risk-matrix anal-ysis process for a ny potential agent. The agents were evaluated in each ofthe general areas according to theobjective parameters and were charac-terized by the rating schemes outlinedin the Appendix. Final categoryassignments (A, B, or C) of agents forpublic health preparedness effortswere then based on an overall evalua- tion of the ratings the agents receivedin each of the four areas. Results Based on the overall criteria and weighting, agents were placed in one of three priority categories for initialpublic health preparedness efforts: A,B, or C (Table 1). Agents in CategoryA have the greatest potential foradverse public health impact withmass casualties, and most requirebroad-based public health prepared-ness efforts (e.g., improved surveil-lance and laboratory diagnosis andstockpiling of specific medications).Category A agents also have a moder- ate to high potential for large-scaledissemination or a heightened generalpublic awareness that could causemass public fear and civil disruption. Most Category B agents also have some potential for large-scale dissemi-nation with resultant illness, but gen-erally cause less illness and death andtherefore would be expected to havelower medical and public healthimpact. These agents also have lowergeneral public awareness than Cate-gory A agents and require fewer spe-cial public health pr eparedness efforts. Agents in this category require someimprovement in public health andmedical awareness, surveillance, orlaboratory diagnostic capabilities, butpresented limited additional require-ments for stockpiled therapeuticsbeyond those identified for CategoryA agents. Biological agents that haveundergone some development forwidespread dissemination but do nototherwise meet the criteria for Cate-gory A, as well as several biologicalagents of concern for food and watersafety, are included in this category. Biological agents that are cur- rently not believed to present a highbioterrorism risk to public health butwhich could emerge as future threats(as scientific understanding of theseagents improves) were placed in Cate-gory C. These agents will beaddressed nonspeci fically through overall bioterrorism preparednessefforts to improve the detection ofunexplained illnesses and ongoingpublic health infrastructure develop-ment for detecting and addressingemerging infectious diseases (13). Agents were categorized based on the overall evaluation of the differentareas considered. Table 2 shows theevaluation schemes as applied toagents in Categories A and B. Forexample, smallpox would rank higherthan brucellosis in the public healthimpact criterion b ecause of its higher untreated mortality (approximately30% for smallpox and < 2% for brucel- losis); smallpox ha s a higher dissemi- nation potential because of itscapability for person-to-person trans-mission. Smallpox also ranks higherfor special public health preparednessneeds, as additional vaccine must bemanufactured and enhanced surveil-lance, educational, and diagnosticefforts must be undertaken. Inhala-tional anthrax and plague also havehigher public health impact ratingsthan brucellosis because of theirhigher morbidity and mortality.Although mass production of Vibrio cholera (the biological cause of chol- era) and Shigella spp. (the cause ofTable 1. Critical biological agent categories for public health preparedness Biological agent(s) DiseaseCategory AVariola major Smallpox Bacillus anthracis Anthrax i r a l Salmonella d western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virusesEmerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 8, No. 2, February 2002 227NEWS & NOTES shigellosis) would be easier than the mass production of anthrax spores, thepublic health impact of widespreaddissemination would be less becauseof the lower morbidity and mortalityassociated with these agents. Althoughthe infectious doses of these bacteriaare generally low, the total amount ofbacteria that would be required andcurrent water purification and food-processing methods would limit theeffectiveness of intentional large-scalewater or food contamination withthese agents. Discussion Although use of conventional weapons such as explosives or fire- arms is still considered the most likelymeans by which terrorists could harmcivilians (14), multi ple recent reports cite an increasing risk and probability for the use of biol ogical or chemical weapons (15-18). Indeed, the use ofbiological and ch emical agents as small- and large-scale weapons hasbeen actively by manynations and terrorist groups (19-20).Although small-s cale bioterrorism events may actually be more likely inlight of the lesser degrees of complex-ity to be overcome, public healthagencies must prep are for the still- possible large-scale incident thatwould undoubtedly lead to cata-strophic public health consequences.The selection and prioritization of thepotential biological terrorism agentsdescribed in this report were not basedon the likelihood of their use, but onthe probability that their use wouldresult in an overwhelming adverseimpact on public health. Most evaluations of potential risk agents for biological warfare or terror-ism have historically been based onmilitary concerns and criteria for troop protection. However, several charac-teristics of civilian populations differfrom those of military populations,including a wider range of age groupsand health conditions, so that lists ofmilitary biological threats cannot sim-ply be adopted for ci vilian use. These differences and ot hers may greatly increase the consequences of a biolog-ical attack on a civilian population.Civilians may also be more vulnerableto food- or waterborne terrorism, aswas seen in the intentional Salmonella contamination of salad bars in TheDalles, Oregon, in 1984 (21).Although food and water systems inthe United States are among the safestin the world, the occurrence of nation-wide outbreaks due to unintentionalfood or water contamination demon-strates the ongoing need for vigilancein protecting food and water supplies(22-23). Overall, many other factorsmust be considered in defining andfocusing multiagenc y efforts to protect civilian populations against bioterror-ism. Category A agents are being given the highest priority for preparedness.For Category B, public health pre-paredness efforts will focus on identi-fied deficiencies, such as improvingawareness and enhancing surveillanceor laboratory diagnostic capabilities.Category C agents will be furtherassessed for their potential to threatenlarge populations as additional infor-mation becomes available on the epi-demiology and pathogenicity of theseagents. In addition, special epidemio-logic and laboratory surge capacitywill be maintained to assist in theinvestigation of naturally occurringoutbreaks due to Category C \"emerg-ing\" agents. Linkages established withestablished programs for food safety,emerging infections diseases, andunexplained illnesses will augment theoverall bioterrorism preparednessefforts for many Category B and Cagents. The above categories of agents should not be considered definitive.The prioritization of biological agents for preparedness efforts should con-tinue. Agents in each category may Table 2.

Disease elim ination and eradi- cation efforts may result in new agentsbeing added to the list as populationslose their natural or vaccine-inducedimmunity to these agents. Conversely,the priority status of certain agentsmay be reduced as the identified pub-lic health and medical deficienciesrelated to these agents are addressed(e.g., once adequate stores of smallpoxvaccine and improved diagnosticcapabilities are established, its ratingwithin the special preparedness needscategory would be reduced, as wouldits overall rating within the risk-matrixevaluation process). To meet the ever-changing response and preparednesschallenges presente d by bioterrorism, a standardized and reproducible evalu-ation process similar to the one out-lined above will continue to be used toevaluate and prioritize currently iden-tified biological critical agents, as wellas new agents that may emerge asthreats to civilian populations ornational security. Appendix Risk-Matrix Analysis Process Used to Evaluate Potential Biological Threat Agents In the area of pub lic health impact, disease threat presented by an agent was assessed by evaluating whether the illness resulting from exposure could be treated without hospitalization. In addition, mor- tality rates for expo sed, untreated persons were considered (24-26). Biological agentswere given a higher rating for morbidity(++) if illness woul d most likely require hospitalization and a lower rating (+) if outpatient treatment mi ght be possible for a large part of the affected population. Agents were also rated highest (+++) for expected untreated mortality > 50%, medium (++) for mortality of 21% to 49%, and lowest (+) for an expected mortality <20%. Agents were rated according to their overall potential for initial disseminationto a large population (+ to +++) and their potential for continued propagation by per- son-to-person transmission (0 to ++).Overall dissemination potential of an agentwas based on an assessment of 1) the capa-bility for mass production of the agent(assessment based on availability of agent and Biosafety Level (BSL) requirements for quantity production of an agent), and 2)their potential for rapid, large-scale dis- semination (assessment based on the most effective route of infection and the generalenvironmental stability of the agent). Agents were rated (++) if they were readily obtainable from soil, animal/insect, or plant sources (most available; e.g., B. anthracis ), (+) if mainly available only from clinical specimens, clinical laborato-ries, or regulated commercial culture sup- pliers (e.g., Shigella spp.), and (0) if available only from nonenvironmental, noncommercial, or nonclinical sources such as high-level security research labo-ratories (least read ily available; e.g., Vari- ola or Ebola viruses). BSL requirements for an agent were based on recommended levels for workingwith large quantities of an agent (27). BSL ratings were used to estimate the level of technical expertise and containment facili-ties that would be required to work with and mass produce an agent safely. Agents that required higher BSL levels were given lower ratings, as they would require greater technical capa bilities and contain- ment facilities to be produced in large quantities. Agents we re given (+) for BSL 4 production safety requirements, (++) for BSL 3 requirements, and (+++) for BSL 2 or lower requirements. Agents were also assessed with regard to their main routes of infection, with theassumption that those causing infection via the respiratory route could be more readilydisseminated to affect large populations. A g e n t s w e r e a s s i g n e d ( + + ) i f m o s t e f f e c -tive at causing illness via an aerosol expo-sure route (air releas e potential) and (+) if most effective when given by the oralroute (food/water rele ase potential). Dis- semination potential s hould also take into account the stab ility of an agent following its release. Inform ation regarding the expected general envi ronmental stability of agents was obtained from multiplesources (24,28-31). Agents that mayremain viable in the environment for > 1 year were given (+++), while agents con-sidered less environm entally stable were given (++) (potentially viable for days to months) or (+) (generally viable for min- utes to hours). The ratings system for envi-ronmental stability wa s assigned to reflectthe wide range of stability of the agents,while maintaining a simple overall scheme that contained only a few categories (min- utes to hours, days to months, >1 year).The ratings for all the subcategories evalu- ated for production and dissemination potential were then totaled and agentswere assigned a final rating for production and dissemination capa bility. If the total rating in the subcategories was > 9, the agent was given (+++); for a total of 7-8,the agent was given a (++); and for a total of < 6, the agent was given a final rating of (+) for the overall production and dissemi- nation capability. As potential outbreak propagation through continued person-to-person trans-mission would also increase the overall dissemination capabilities of an agent, they were evaluated separate ly for this charac- teristic. Agents were rated highest if theyhad potential for both person-to-personrespiratory and contact spread (+++) and lower for mainly respiratory (++) or con- tact spread potential alone (+). Agentswere rated (0) if they presented low or no transmission risk. Agents were also assessed (0 to +++) according to preexisting heightened pub-lic awareness and interest, which may con- tribute to mass public fear or panic in biological terrorism events. The number of times an agent or disease appeared in aselected form of media was used as a sur- rogate to determine the current level of public awareness and interest for the agentor disease. Titles of newspaper articles and radio and television transcripts from June1, 1998, to June 1, 1999, in an Internetdatabase (32) were retrospectively searched by agent name and disease. This database contained ar ticles and transcripts from approximately 233 newspapers and 70 radio or television s ources. If a disease was caused by multiple agents (e.g., viral hemorrhagic fever), the database was searched for each of the agents in additionto the name of the disease. Articles or tran-scripts were only coun ted if the name of the agent, disease, or other general termssuch as bioterrorism , biological terrorism, terrorism, and weapons of mass destruc- tion appeared in the title. Multiple hits for the same title were counted only onceunless they appeared in different newspa- pers or transcripts. Agents were rated based on the number of times theyappeared in these forms of media within the 1-year period. Agents were given (0)Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 8, No. 2, February 2002 229NEWS & NOTES rating for <5 titles, (+ ) for 5-20 titles, (++) for 21-45 titles, and (+++) for >45 titles identified within the search period. Requirements for sp ecial public health preparedness were also considered. Higher ratings were given to agents with different requirements for spec ial preparedness. An agent was given a (+) for each special pre-paredness activity that would be required to enhance the public health response tothat agent. These distinct preparedness requirements included 1) stockpiling of therapeutics to assure treatment of largenumbers of people (+), 2) need for enhanced public health surveillance and education (+), and 3) augmentation of rapid laboratory diag nostic capabilities (+). Therefore, if all three special pre-paredness efforts woul d be required to pro- vide a strong public health response for that agent, it was given (+++) for this cate-gory. Agents that did not require all specialpreparedness efforts were given lower rat- ings (++ or +).

Patient s experience a non-specif symp toms including fever, myalgia, heada che, non-pr oductive co ugh, and mild chest discomfort. Upper respiratory symptoms such a s nasal congestion or rh inorrhea are not consist ent with an anthrax infection . Following the prodromal period, patients may experience a brief inte rim improvement. Two to four days after initial symptoms, patients will experi ence abrupt onset of respiratory distress, high fever and hemodyna mic collap se. Symptoms o f respiratory stridor and dyspnea are caused by massive me diastinal edema, and pleural effusions rat its f inal stage, w idened mediastinum is a distinguishing though inco nsistent feat ure of anthrax infection. Approxima tely 50% of all case s of inhalation anthrax are accompanied by fatal hemorrhagic meningitis. Cutaneous anthrax begins with a localized prurit ic papule or macule. The lesion develops into a filled serosa nguinous flu id and loca lized vesicles may appear. The vesicle ruptures ving a painless, necrot ic ulcer. A black eschar f orms in the base of the ulcer and remains for 2-3 weeks b efore separ ating. The u lcer is u sually accompanied by fever, malaise an d headache. Severe local edema and lymphadenit is may be present. Lethality : Without trea tment, the mortality rate for inhalation anthrax is almost 100%. Rapid treatment increase the chance of sur vival. In the anthrax outbreak of 200 1 in the Unit ed States, six out of eleven patients with inhalation al anthrax su rvived. Up to 20% of u ntreated cut aneous anth rax cases may die from septicemia; however, when appropriately treated with antibiotics, less than 1 % die. Transmissibility : Perso n-to-person transmissio n of inhalational anthrax does not occur. Vegetative bacteria can be grown from the bullae and under the eschar of cutaneou s anthrax lesions, so ca re must be taken with draining lesion s to prevent person-to-person spread.

It is now docu mented that in some con ditions, spores can be disseminated from an ordinarily se aled paper e nvelope during mechanical mail sorting activities and by simply remo ving the contents from a contaminated envelope. Secondary Contamination & Persi stence of Organism: Spores can p ersist in the environment indefinitely. However, se condary aerosolizat ion o f spores fro m clothing o r skin is uncommon. Decontamination & Isolation: Patients - Exposed areas of skin sho uld be wash ed with soa p and water after potential contact with contaminated materials. Patients wit h anthrax infection shou ld be managed using sta ndard precautions. Equip ment, clothing & ot her objects - A 0.5% hypochlorite solution is eff ective in cle aning the environment (1 part household blea ch + 9 parts water = 0.5% solution). Contact with hypochlorite solution should be maintained for 10 minutes, to effectively kill any spore s present. S poricidal disinfect ants may be effe ctive. Contaminated clot hing should be washed in soap and water, with or without blea ch. Outbreak Control: Only those people who were exposed di rectly to anthrax should receive prophylaxis. There is no need to immunize or give prophyla xis to people who have later contact with anthrax-exp osed individ uals. Laboratory testing: The most useful microbiologic test is the standard blood and or wound cult ure, which should show growth within 24 hours. If th e laboratory has been alerted to the possibility of B. anthracis (anthrax), biochemical testing and review of colonial morphology should provide a preliminary diagnosis within 12 to 24 hours. A dir ect fluorescent antibody test (DFA) is currently available for preliminary diagnosis at the Arizona State Health Laboratory. Laboratory confirmation for diagnosis requires a n additional 1 to 2 days of testing. S putum or nasal culture s are not usef ul for screening e xposures. For cutaneo us lesion s, collect vesicu lar fluid on sterile swabs. If it is in the eschar sta ge, use sterile swab to collect lesio n material under eschar. Fo r evaluation of inhalation al anthrax, collect a rout ine blood cultur e and sputu m culture. For suspect ed d vomitus. In addition a chest radiog raph and/or chest CT scan is neede d to evaluate for a widened mediastinum and pleural effusions. If sympto ms of meningitis are pr esen t, cerebrospinal fluid should be cultur ed. Therapeutic Treatment: inhala tion anthrax, ciprofloxaci n doxycycline shou be for initial intravenous therap y until antimicrobial su sceptibility results are kno wn. In addition, there should be a dded at least one or two other antibio tics predicte d to be effective, these include: B. anthr are sen sitive to peni cillin, treatment of syste mic anthrax infection u sing penicil lin alo ne (i.e., peni cillin G or ampicillin) i s not recommended until sensitivitie s are known.

Anthrax is a serious dise ase caused by Bacillus anthracis , a bacterium that forms spores. A bacterium is a very smal l organism made up of one cell. Ma ny bacteria can cause d isease. A spore is a cell that is do rmant (asleep) but may c ome to life with the righ t condition s. There are three types of anthrax: Skin (cutane ous) Lungs (inhalation) Digestive (gastrointest inal) How do y ou get it? Anthrax is not known to spread from one person to another. Anthrax from ani mals - Humans can become infected with anthrax by h andling prod ucts from infected animals or by breathing in a nthrax spores from infect ed animal products (like wool, for example). People also can become infected with gastrointest inal anthrax by eating undercooke d meat from infected animals. Anthrax as a weapon - Anthrax also can be use d as a weapon. This hap pened in the United States in 20 01. Anthrax was deliber ately spread through the postal syste m by sending letters with powder containing anthrax. This caused 22 cases of an thrax infection. How dange rous is anthrax? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cl assify agents with recognized biot errorism potential int o three prior ity areas (A, B and C). Anthrax is cla ssified a Category A age nt. Category A agents are those that: Pose the greatest possible threat fo r a bad effect on public h ealth May spread across a large area or need public a wareness Need a great deal of pla nning to prot ect the public's healt h In most cases, early treatment with antibiotics can cure cuta neous anthr ax. Even if u ntreated, 80 percent of p eople who become infected with cut aneous anth rax do not die. Gastrointestinal anthrax is more serious because bet ween one-fourth and more than half of cases lead to death. Inhalation a nthrax is much more severe. In 2001 , about half of the cases of inhalatio n anthrax ended in de ath.

The sympto ms (warning signs) of an thrax are different depending on the t ype of the disease: Cutaneous - The first sympto m is a small sore t hat develops into a blist er. The blist er then develops int o a skin u lcer with a black area in the center. The sore, blister and ulcer d o not hurt. Gastrointest inal - The fir st symptoms are nause a, loss of ap petite, blood y diarrhea, and fever, followed by bad stomach pain. Inhalation - The first sy mptoms of inhalation an thrax are similar to influ enza with fe ver, fatigue, a dr y cough, and muscle aches. Later sympto ms include worse ning cough, chest discomfort, and shortne ss of breath. (Caution: Most people with cold or influenza symptoms do not have inhalation a nthrax.) How soon do infected people get sick? Symptoms u sually appe ar within 7 d ays of coming in contact with the bacterium for all three types of anthrax. However, fo r inhalation anthrax, symptoms can sometimes take up to 4 2 days to appear. How is ant hrax treated? Antibiotics a re used to tr eat all three types of anthrax. Early i dentificat ion and treatment are important. Prevention after exposu re - Antibioti cs such as ciprofloxacin, doxyc ycline, or penicil lin will be given to people who are known to be exposed to anthrax, but are not yet sick. In add ition, anthrax vac cine may be used. Treat ment after infection - Treatment involves a 60-day course of effect ive antibiotics. Response t o therapy depends on ho w ill the pati ent is, wher e the infecti on is locate d, and how quickly effective antibiotics are begu n. Can anthra x be prevented? There is a vaccine to pr event anthrax, but it is n ot yet available for the g eneral public. Anyone who may be e xposed to anth rax, includin g certain members of the U.S. armed forces, labo ratory workers, and workers who may ente r or re-enter contaminated areas, may get the va ccine. Also, in the event of an attack using anthra x as a weapon, people e xposed could get the vaccine. What should I do if I think I have a nthrax? If you are showing sympt oms of anthrax in fection, call your he alth-care pr ovider. What should I do if I think I have b een exposed to anthrax? Contact loca l law enforcement imme diately if you think that y ou may ha ve been exposed to anthrax. This include s being exposed to a suspicious pa ckage or envelope that cont ains powder.

The seven distinct toxins (A through G) are produced by different strains of the bacillus. Routes of Exposure: Inhalation, or al (infant bot ulism and wound botulism are not included in th e discussion b elow) Toxic Dose: 1 ng/kg (f or type ge nerally begin after aero sol exposure. However, th e incubation period for b oth can rang e from 6 hours to 10 da ys. Clinical Effects: Acute, afebrile, sy mmetric descending par alysis. Botulinum toxins are neurotoxins that act to pr event the release of acet ylcholine pr esynaptically and thus block neurotr ansmission. Multiple cra nial nerve palsies are often the first sympto ms seen. Bulbar palsies are prominent early, with eye symptoms such as blurred vision due t o mydriasis, diplopia, pt osis and ph otophobia, in addition to bulbar signs such as dysarthria, dysphonia, and dysphagia. Skeleta l muscle par alysis follows with a symmetrical descend ing and progressi ve weakness, which may culmi nate abruptly in respiratory failure. Dee p tendon reflexes ma y be present or absent. Lethality : The mortality rate from botulism is 6 0% if the pat ient goes un treated and less than 5% if the patient receives appropriate treatment. All the b otulinum toxins are sligh tly less toxic when expo sure is by the pulmonary route. Transmissibility : Botul inum toxin cannot be tra nsmitted person-to-person. Primary Contaminations & Metho ds of Dissemination: The use of b otulinum toxin as a bio logical weapon would like ly be by aerosolization, or by int entional contamination of food or water supplies. Secondary Contamination & Persi stence of Organism: The toxin does not penetr ate intact skin. C. botulinum spores can p ersist in the environment , and wound botulism ca n result whe n an open wound is contamin ated. Decontamination & Isolation: Patients - Patients can be managed using stand ard precautions. No decontamination is necessary f ollowing foo dborne exposure. Follo wing aer osol exposure to botulinum toxin, skin should be rinsed with soap and water.

Clot hing should be washed with soap a nd water. Laboratory Testing: For detection of inhaled a erosolized b otulinum toxin, gastric a spirate and possibly sto ol may contain the toxin. In suspect ed food borne disease t he appropriate specime ns for toxin assay are serum, stool, gastric aspirate, vomitus, and the implicate d food (if available). Th e confirmatory test is ba sed on a mouse bioassay demonstrating the toxin. Diagnostic services are available only through the CDC via the state health department. Therapeutic Treatment: Treatment is the sam e for inhalation (aerosolized) exposure as for ing estion (foodborne). Care is su pportive. Long term mec hanical ventilation may be needed fo r several weeks to months. A trivalent equine antitoxin for food-borne botulism is available from the CDC throug h the Arizona Department of Health Services. Use of t he antitoxin requires skin testing for horse serum sensitivity prior to administration. Pro viders should refer to th e information sheet that comes with the antitoxin. Proph ylactic Treatment: Currently, there is no commercially available vaccine. Differential Diagnosis: Single case s may be confused with various neuromuscular disorders su ch as atypical Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, myasthenia gravis, or tick paralysis. B otulism coul d also be co nfused with enteroviral infect ions, but in the se patients, fever is present, paralysis is often a symmetrical, and the CSF is abnormal. It may be nec essary to distinguish nerve agent and atropine p oisoning fro m botulinum intoxication. I n organophosphate ner ve agent poisoning pupils are miotic and copious secretions a re present. In atropine p oisoning, th e pupils are dilated and mucous me mbranes are dry, but central n ervous system excitation with hallucinations and delirium is present.

Botulism is a rare but serious paral ytic illness caused by a ne rve toxin that is produced b y the bacterium Clostridium botulinum . There are thr ee main kinds of botulis m. Foodb orne b otulism is caused by eati ng foods that co ntain the botulism to xin. Wound b otulism is caused by to xin pro duced from a wound infec ted with Clostridium botulin um. Infant botulism is caused by consu ming the spores of the botulinum bacteria, which then g row in the intestines and release toxin. All forms of botulism can be fatal and are consider ed medical emergencies. What kind of germ is Clostridium b otulinum ? Clostridium botulinum is the name of a group of bac teria co mmonly found in soil. These r od-shap ed organisms gr ow best in low oxygen co nditions. The bacteri a form spores that allow them to survive in a dormant state until expos ed to conditi ons that can support their growth. There are seven t ypes of botulism toxin design ated by the letters A through G. How common is botulism? In the United States an averag e of 110 cases of bot ulism are reported each year . Of these, approximat ely 25% are foo dborne, 72% are infant bo tulism, and t he rest are w ound b otulism. Outbreaks of foodbor ne botulism involving two or more person s occur mo st years and u sually caus ed by eating contaminated home-cann ed foods. The number of cases of foodborne and infa nt botulism h as changed little in recent years, but wound b otulism has increased because of the use of black-tar her oin, especially in Californi a. What are th e symptoms of botulism? The classic symptoms of botulism include do uble vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred spee ch, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness. Infants with botulism appear let hargic, feed poorl y, are constipated, and ha ve a weak cry and po or mu scle tone. These are all symptoms of the muscle paral ysis cau sed by the bacterial to xin. If untreated , these symptoms may progress to ca use paralysis of the arms, legs, trunk and respiratory m uscles. In foodbo rne bot ulism, symptoms generall y begin 1 8 to 36 hours after eating a contaminated food , but they ca n occur as e arly as 6 hours or as late as 10 days. How is botulism diagno sed? Physicians may consider the diagnos is if the patie nt's history and physical exam ination suggest botulism. Howe ver, th ese clues ar e usually not enoug h to allow a diagn osis of botulism. Other diseases such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, stroke, and myasthenia gravis can appear similar to botulis m, and special tests may be nee ded to exclud e these other conditions. These tests may include a brain scan, spinal fluid examinatio n, nerve cond uction test (electromyogr aphy, or EMG), and a tensilon te st for myasthenia gr avis. The most dir ect way to co nfirm the diagnosis is to d emonstrate the botulinum toxin in the patient's serum or stool by injecting seru m or stool into mice and l ooking for signs of botulism. The bacteria can also be isolated from the stool of persons with foodborn e and infant botulis m. These tests can be performed a t the Centers for Disease Co ntrol and Prevention. Update d August 2004 Page 4. 8 Arizona Department o f Health Services Division of Public Health S ervices Office o f Public Health Emerg ency Prepare dness and Response Frequently Asked Q uestions About Botulism (conti nued from previ ous page) Update d August 2004 Page 4. 9 Arizona Department o f Health Services How can botulism be treated? The respirat ory failure a nd paral ysis that occur wi th severe bot ulism may require a patie nt to be on a breathin g machine (ventil ator) for wee ks, plus inten sive medical and nu rsing care. After sever al weeks, the paral ysis slowly improves. If diagnosed early, food borne and w ound botulism can be treated with an antitoxin that blocks the a ction of toxin circulating in the blood. This can prevent patient s from worseni ng, but recover y still takes ma ny weeks. Physicians ma y try to remove contaminated food still in the gut b y inducing vo miting or by using enema s. Wounds should be tre ated, usually su rgically, to remove the source of the toxin-p roducing b acteria. Good suppo rtive car e in a hospital is the mainstay of therapy for all for ms of botulism. Are there co mplications from botulis m? Botulism can result in death due to respirator y failu re. However, in the past 50 years the pr oportion of patients with botulism who die has fallen from about 50% to 8%. A pat ient with severe bot ulism may requir e a bre athing machine as well as intensive m edical and n ursing care for several m onths. Patients who survi ve an episode o f botulis m poisoning may have fatigue and shor tness of breath fo r years and long-term th erapy may b e need ed to aid recove ry. How can botulism be prevented? Botulism can be prevente d. Foodbor ne botulism h as often been from home-canned foo ds with low acid content, such as asparag us, green be ans, beets a nd wever, outbr eaks of botulism have occurre d from more unusual sources such as chopp ed garli c in oil, chili pepp ers, tomatoes, improperly h andle d baked potato es wrappe d in aluminum foil, and home- canne d or fermented fish. Persons who do home canning sho uld follow strict hygienic procedur es to reduc e conta mination of foods. O ils infused with ga rlic or herbs sho uld be refrige rated. Potatoes that hav e been b aked while wra pped in aluminu m foil should be kept hot until served or re frigerat ed. Because botulism toxin is d estroyed b y high tempera tures, persons who eat hom e-canned foods should c onsider boiling the food for 10 minut es before eating it to ensure safety. Instructions on sa fe home c anning can be obtained from county exte nsion services or from the US Depa rtment of Agriculture. Bec ause honey can co ntain spores of Clostridium botulinum and this has been a source of infection for infants, children less than 12 months old should not be fed hone y. Honey is safe for persons 1 year of age and olde r. Wound b otulism c an be prevented b y promptly seeking medical care for infected woun ds and by not us ing injectable street drugs. What are public health a gencies doing to prevent or control botulism? Public education about bo tulism prev ention is an ongoing activity. Inform ation about safe canning is widely availa ble for consumers. State health depa rtments and CD C ha ve per sons knowle dgeable about botul ism availa ble to consult with physicians 24 hours a day. If antitoxin is need ed to treat a patient, it can be quickly delivered to a ph ysician anywh ere in the c ountry. Suspected outbrea ks of botulism are quickly investigated, and if they invol ve a commercial produc t, the appropriate cont rol m easures are coordina ted among pu blic health and regulato ry agencies. Physicians should report su spected cases o f botulism to county or state health dep artments.

The presentati on includes high feve r, cough, chest pain, mala ise, hemoptysis, and muco-purule nt or watery sputum with gram- negative rod s on gram stain. Patients commonly show evi denc e of broncho pneumo nia. The pneum onia inal iting, diarrhe a and abd ominal pai n might also be present. Buboes (regional lymphad enopathy) a re rarely seen. Other advance d signs of pn eumonic pla gue include r espiratory failure, circulatory collaps e, and bleedi ng diathesis. Lethalit y: The mortality rate of pneumo nic plague us ually is 90-1 00%. However, with pro mpt appropriate t reatment, the mortalit y rate drops to 5% or less. Transmissibility (person to person): Person-to-person trans mission occu rs via respira tory dro Primar y Contamination & Methods of Dissemination: Disse mination of plague as a biological wea pon would most likely be throu gh aer osolization. Secondar y Contamination & Persistence of organism: Y. pestis is very sensitive to sunlight and h eat and do es not survive long outside of th e host. Therefore , secondary contami nation is not a concern. Decontamin ation & Isolation: Patients - Patients with suspected pneumonic pla gue should b e manage d with droplet precautions. Plague patie nts wit hout p neumoni a require onl y standa rd prec autions. Drainage from bubo es should be considered infecti ous and treate d with appro priate person al protective equipme nt (e.g. gloves whe n touching drai nage, go wns if clothes could be contaminated). Equipment & other objects - Environmental decontaminat ion can be done us ing a 0.5% hypochlo rite solution (1 part househol d bleach + 9 parts water = 0.5% solutio n), prior to normal cleaning or washing. Outbreak control - All patients with pneumonic pla gue should b e in droplet isolation for the first 48 hours after the initiation of treatm ent. This means that a healthcare worker should use a surgical ma sk within 3 feet of the patient. Thos e who have b een in household o r face-to- face contact with patients with pneumo nic plague should be given ant ibiotic proph ylaxis and pl aced unde r fever sur veillance for 7 da ys.

Confirmation of organism is done b y DFA, phage typin g, and/or PCR. 2. Antibody res ponse test- A four-fold rise in antibody titer by ELISA or passiv e hemaggl utination in patient serum is also diagnostic. Therapeutic Treatment: Historically, the treatment of choice fo r bubo nic, se pticemic, and pneumo nic plague h as been streptomycin. However, since streptomycin is n o longer readily availa ble, gentamicin appe ars just as effective. Doxycycline or ciprofloxa cin are alter native antibi otics. Once the patient is stable, an effectice oral a ntibiotic can be used to comp lete the course of therapy. IV chlo ramphe nicol is the drug of choice for plague menin gitis. Proph ylactic Treatment: Because o f oral administration and relati ve lack of toxicity, the antibiotic for prophylaxis or for use in face-to-face contacts of patients with pn eumonic plague is doxyc ycline.

Plague is a disease caused by Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis ), a bacterium found in rodents and their fleas in many areas around the world. Why are we concerned about pneumonic plague as a biological weapon? Yersinia pestis used in an aerosol attack could cause cases of the pneumonic form of plague. One to six days after becoming infected with the bacteria, people would develop pneumonic plague. Once people have plague pneumonia, the bacteria can spread to others who have close contact with them. Because of the delay between being exposed to the bacteria and becoming sick, people could travel a long distance before then becoming contagious and possibly infecting others. Controlling the disease would then be more difficult. A biological weapon that spreads Y. pestis is possible because the bacterium occurs in nature and could be isolated and grown in quantity in a laboratory. Even so, manufacturing an effective weapon using Y. pestis would require advanced knowledge and technology. Is pneumonic plague different from bubonic plague? Yes. Both are caused by Yersinia pestis , but they are transmitted differently and their symptoms differ. Pneumonic plague can be transmitted direct ly from person-to-person by coughing. Bubonic plague is hardly ever spread person to person. Pneumonic plague affects the lungs and is transmitted when a person breathes in Y. pestis particles in the air. Bubonic plague is transmitted through the bite of an infected flea or exposure to infected material through a break in the skin. Symptoms include swollen, tender lymph glands called buboes. If bubonic plague is not treated, however, the bacteria can spread through the bloodstream and infect the lungs, causing a secondary case of pneumonic plague. What are the signs and symptoms of pneumonic plague? Patients usually have fever, weakness, and rapidl y developing pneumonia with shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, and sometimes bloody or watery sputum. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain may also occur. Without early treatment, pneumonic plague usually leads to respiratory failure, shock, and rapid death. How do people become infected with pneumonic plague? Pneumonic plague occurs when Yersinia pestis infects the lungs. Transmission can take place if someone breathes in Y. pestis particles, which could happen in an aerosol release during a bioterrorism attack. Pneumonic plague is also transmitted by breathing in Y. pestis suspended in respiratory droplets from a person (or animal) with pneumonic plague. Respiratory droplets are spread most readily by coughing or sneezing. Becoming infected in this way usually requires direct and close (within 6 feet) contact with the ill person or animal. Pneumonic plague may also occur if a person with bubonic or septicemic plague is untreated and the bacteria spread to the lungs. Frequently Asked Questions About Plague (continued from previous page) Updated August 2004 Page 4.13 Arizona Department of Health Services Division of Public Health Services Office of Public Health Emerg ency Preparedness and Response Does plague occur naturally in the United States and in Arizona? Yes. Today, plague remains a naturally occurring infection of rats, ground squirrels, prairie dogs, and other rodents on every populated continent except Australia. In the U.S. plague is most common in the southwestern states, particularly New Mexico and Arizona. An average of 1 to 2 cases of human plague occur naturally each year in Arizona. Most cases are seen in the northwest portion of the state, although cases can likely occur anywhere in the state above 4000 feet of elevation. Can a person exposed to pneumonic plague avoid becoming sick? Yes. People who have had close contact with an infected person can greatly reduce the chance of becoming sick if they begin treatment within 7 days of their exposure. Treatment consists of taking antibiotics for at least 7 days. How quickly would someone get sick if exposed to plague bacteria through the air? Someone exposed to Yersinia pestis through the air\u2014either from an intentional aerosol release or from close and direct exposure to someone with plague pneumonia\u2014would become ill within 1 to 6 days. Can pneumonic plague be treated? Yes. Several types of antibiotics are effective for curing the disease, and also for preventing it. Available oral medications are a tetracycline (such as doxycycline) or a fluoroquinolone (such as ciprofloxacin). For injection or intravenous use, streptomycin or gentamicin antibiotics are used. Would enough medication be available in the event of a bioterrorism attack involving pneumonic plague? National and state public health officials have large supplies of drugs needed in the event of a bioterrorism attack. These supplies can be sent anywhere in the United States within 12 hours. What should someone do if they suspect they or others have been exposed to plague? Get immediate medical attention. A person who has been exposed to pneumonic plague should rapidly receive antibiotics to prevent illness. Loc al or state health departments should be notified of the possibility of a patient with plague. They will then immediately investigate to determine whether the illness were due to naturally occurring disease. How can someone reduce the risk of getting pneumonic plague from another person or giving it to someone else? People having direct and close contact with someone with pneumonic plague should wear disposable surgical masks. Patients with the disease should be isolated and medically supervised for at least the first 48 hours of antibiotic treatment. People who have been exposed to a contagious person can be protected from developing plague by receiving prompt antibiotic treatment. How is plague diagnosed? The first step is receiving an evaluation by a health worker. If the health worker suspects pneumonic plague, samples of the patient's blood, sputum, or lymph node aspirate are sent to a laboratory for testing. Some preliminary laboratory results can be available in just a few hours, though more definite results usually take several days. Frequently Asked Questions About Plague (continued from previous page) Updated August 2004 Page 4.14 Arizona Department of Health Services Division of Public Health Services Office of Public Health Emerg ency Preparedness and Response How long can plague bacteria exist in the environment? Yersinia pestis is easily destroyed by sunlight and drying. Even so, when released into air, the bacterium will survive for up to one hour, depending on conditions. Is a vaccine available to prevent pneumonic plague? Currently, no plague vaccine is available in the United States. Research is in progress, but we are not likely to have vaccines for several years or more.

There are two different strains of th e virus, variola major and variola minor. Variola major causes a more severe illness. No cases of smallpox have been observed in the world since 1 978. The World Heath Orga nization de clared the world free smallpox free in 1980. Routes of Exposure: Inhalation or contact with skin lesions o r secretions Infective Dose: The inf ectious do se is unknow it is believed to be 10-100 virions. Incubation Period: The incubation period of ra nges from 7-17 days, with an average of 12 days. Clinical Effects: The illness begin s with a prodrome lasting 2-3 days, with generalized severe malaise, fever, rigors, h eadache, an d backache. Abdominal pain and delirium are sometimes pre sent. These symptoms are followed by a rash that pro gresses ove r 7 to 10 days. Lesion s develop at the same stage, starting fir st as macules, and then changing to p apules, then to vesicles, then to pust ules and finally t o scabs. Th e lesions ar e most concentrat ed on the face and extremities, and they are least dense on th e trunk. Th e lesions ar e firm and deep-seated. Approximately 10% of cases will ha ve an atypical type of rash describ ed as either fl at smallpox or hemorrhagic smallpox. These patie nts also hav e a prostr ating febrile pr odrome. In the flat form, the skin le sions never fully organize; in stead they remain soft, flattened and velvet y to the touch. In t he hemorrhagic form there is bleeding u nder the skin and overwhelming DIC without the developmen t of characterist ic pox lesion s. Lethality : The mortality rate of smallpox is 20-50% in unvaccinated individuals. Hemorrhagic and malignant cases are 95- 100% fatal. Transmissibility : Smallpox is not contagious d uring the in cubation period. Persons with smallpox become infectious at the onset of the rash, and r emain infect ious until all of the scabs have fallen off. Person-to-person transmission occurs by droplet ex posure to oropharyngeal secret ions, and by contact with skin le sions. Close, face-to-face contact is u sually requir ed for alth ough airbor ne transmissio n in a hospit al may have occurred in one outbreak. Primary contamination & Method s of Dissemination: Any case of smallpox wou ld be consid ered an act of terrorism. Smallp ox virus could be delivered vi a aerosol, or by me ans of an int entionally inf ected individual. Secondary Transmission & Persis tence of organism: Humans are the only for host for smallpox. People have been infect ed by contact with smallpox pat ients' linen, pre sumably b y fomite transmission. However, s mallpox has only been found to spre ad when there is an iden tifiable pat ient with active infection.

Equip ment, clothing & ot her objects - Contaminated clothin g and bed linens can sp read the virus. Laundry should be bagg ed with minimal agitatio n to prevent contamination of air, sur faces, or pe ople. Only immuni zed workers using proper PPE shoul d handle contaminated laundry. Laundering should be done using hot water to which ble ach has bee n added. Disinfectant s that are used for standar d hospital control, such a s hypochlorit e or quaternary ammoni a, are effective for cleaning surfaces possibly con taminated with virus. W aste should be placed in biohazard b ags and discarded acco rding to medical waste regulations. Outbreak c ontrol: Control of smallp ox is based upon vaccin ation with th e vaccinia virus and iso lation of cases. A suspect case of smallpo x should be considered a public hea lth emergency. Local, tr ibal and state he alth departments should be notified immediately. As soon as the diagnosis of smallpo x is made, all su spected sm allpox cases should be isolated. Ad ditionally, all household and face-to- face contacts should be vaccinated as soon as possible. The sm allpox vaccine does not confer lifelo ng immunity. Laboratory testing: Smallpox virus can be foun d in vesicula r or pustular fluid by PCR or by culture. Electron microscopy can identify an orthopox virus, but cann ot differentia te between variola, vaccinia, or monkeyp ox. Smallpo x virus testing is currently only availa ble through the CDC. Local and st ate health d epartments should be contacted immediately if smallpox is a considerat ion. People who collect samples to test for smallpox should wear proper personal protective equipme nt and have received a recent smallpox va ccine. Smal lpox evaluation is done b y sampling skin lesions, drawing blood, and doin g throat swabs for testin g by culture, EM, PCR, a nd serology. Therapeutic Treatment: There is n o proven effective anti-viral tr eatment for smallpo x. Cidofovir has in vitro activity against sma llpox and co uld be avail able by an investigation al new drug protocol. Proph ylactic Treatment: A highly effective smallpox vaccine exists using vaccinia virus, another orthopox virus. It is b eing used by the military and for public health prep aredness. It is not being offered to th e general pu blic since as of July 2004 there is no one in the world with smallpox infection. There is eno ugh vaccine available to vaccinate e veryone in t he United States, if there were a smallpox outbreak. Vaccination within 3 days of exposure will prev ent or signifi cantly modify s mallpox in the vast majority of persons. Vaccination 4 to 7 days protects again st death, but will not prevent infection . Differential Diagnosis: The differen tial includ e varicella (chickenpox) and monkey p ox. The lesions of varicella arise in crops, are superficial, and are almost never found on t he palms or soles. In contrast, the r ash asso ciated with smallpox does not appear in cr ops: all l esions on one p art of the bo dy will be at the same stage of development. Smallpox lesions are deep and fir m, and are most conce ntrated on t he face and extremities, including p alms and soles. Mon key pox, a n aturally occurring relative of smallpo x, occurs in Africa. The lesions are clinically indistinguisha ble from smallpox, they are fewer in num ber and the patients are less toxic. Smallpox ca ses that pre sent in the h emorrhagi c form can be misdiagnosed as meningococcemia or severe acute leukemia.

Smallpox is an acute, contagious, and sometimes fatal disease caused by the variola virus (an orthopoxvirus), and marked by fever and a distinctive progressive skin rash. In 1980, the disease was declared eradicated following worldwide vaccination programs. However, in the aftermath of the events of September and Oct ober, 2001, plans are in place to deal with a bioterrorist attack using smallpox as a weapon. If I am concerned about a smallpox attack, can I go to my doctor and get the smallpox vaccine? At the moment, the smallpox vaccine is not avai lable for members of the general public. In the event of a smallpox outbreak, however, there is enough smallpox vaccine to vaccinate everyone who would need it. What are the symptoms of smallpox? The symptoms of smallpox begin with high fever, head and body aches, and sometimes vomiting. A rash follows that spreads and progresses to raised bumps and pus-filled blisters that crust, scab, and fall off after about three weeks, leaving pitted scars. If someone comes in contact with smallpox, how long does it take to show symptoms? After exposure, it takes between 7 and 17 days for symptoms of smallpox to appear (average incubation time is 12 to 14 days). During this time, the infected person feels fine and is not contagious. Is smallpox fatal? The majority of patients with smallpox recover, but death may occur in up to 30% of cases. Many smallpox survivor s have permanent scars over large areas of their body, especially their face. Some are left blind. How is smallpox spread? Smallpox normally spreads from contact with infected persons. Generally, direct and fairly prolonged face-to-face contact is required to spread smallpox from one person to another. Smallpox also can be spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated objects such as bedding or clothing. Indirect spread is less common. Rarely, smallpox has been spread by virus carried in the air in enclosed settings such as buildings, buses, and trains. Smallpox is not spread by insects or animals. If smallpox is released in aerosol form, how long does the virus survive? The smallpox virus is fragile. In laboratory experiments, 90% of aerosolized smallpox virus dies within 24 hours. In the presence of ultraviolet (UV) light, this percentage is even greater. Therefore, if an aerosol release of smallpox were to occur, most of the smallpox virus matter would be inactivated or dissipated within 24 hours. Frequently Asked Questions About Smallpox (continued from previous page) Updated August 2004 Page 4.19 Arizona Department of Health Services Division of Public Health Services Office of Public Health Emerg ency Preparedness and Response How many people would have to get smallpox before it is considered an outbreak? One confirmed case of smallpox is considered a public health emergency. Is smallpox contagious before the smallpox symptoms show? A person with smallpox will have a fever and be quite ill for several days before the rash appears. A person is not contagious until the rash begins. The infected person is contagious until the last smallpox scab falls off. Is there any treatment for smallpox? Smallpox can be prevented through use of the sm allpox vaccine. There is no proven treatment for smallpox, but research to evaluate new antiviral agents is ongoing. Early results from laboratory studies suggest that the drug cidofovir may fight against the smallpox virus; currently, studies with animals are being done to better understand the drug's ability to treat smallpox disease. Patients with smallpox can benefit from supportive therapy (e.g., intravenous fluids, medicine to control fever or pain) and antibiotics for any secondary bacterial infections that may occur. What is the smallpox vaccine? The smallpox vaccine is the only way to prevent smallpox. The vaccine is made from a virus called vaccinia , which is another \"pox\"-type virus related to smallpox. The vaccine cannot cause smallpox. The vaccine helps the body develop immunity to smallpox. It was successfully used to eradicate smallpox from the human population. Should I get vaccinated against smallpox? The smallpox vaccine is not available to the public at this time. Many vaccinations are required. Why don't people have to get the smallpox vaccine? The last case of smallpox in the United States was in 1949. The last naturally occurring case in the world was in Somalia in 1977. After the disease was eliminated from the world, routine vaccination against smallpox among the general public was stopped because it was no longer necessary for prevention. If someone is exposed to smallpox, is it too late to get a vaccination? Vaccination within 3 days of exposure will completely prevent or significantly modify smallpox in the vast majority of persons. Vaccination 4 to 7 days after exposure likely offers some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease. How long does a smallpox vaccination last? Past experience indicates that the first dose of the vaccine offers protection from smallpox for 3 to 5 years, with decreasing immunity thereafter. If a person is vaccinated again later, immunity lasts longer. For more informatio n call (602) 364-3289 TULAREMIA Bioterrorism Agent A gent: Tularemia is a Francisella tularensis . Routes of Exposure: acquire d by huma ns by inoculation of the skin or mucous membranes with blood or tissue from infected animals, or bites of infected d eerflies, mosquitoes, or ticks. Less commo nly, inhalatio n of contam inated dust or ingestion of contaminated foods or water can also cause human disease. T he animal re servoirs of disease incl ude rabbits, muskrats, and incubation p eriod nges from 1 to 14 days with an aver age of 3 to 5 days. Clinical Effects: Differe nt clinical forms of di sease are seen de pending o n the route of exposur e. Disease resulting from intenti onal aerosol rele ase tularemia. Gastrointestinal symp toms su ch as dia rrhea and pa in may also be present. Typhoi dal tularemia manifests with fever, pr ostration, weight loss, but with no ade nopath y. Pneumonia is most common with the typhoid al form. Tularemia pneumo nia is generally a severe atypical pneum onia that may be fulminating and can resu lt from either inhalati on of infectious aerosols or from aspiration of organisms from the pharynx. Tularemia pne umonia can emia. Tularemia pneumo nia mediastinal lymphade o r may not be present. Oculoglan dular tularemia can result from inocul ation o f the conjunctivae with ha nd or fingers contaminated by tissue and/or fluids from an infected animal. The gastrointestinal form of tularemia manifests as abdominal p ain, nausea, vom iting and diar rhea. Lethalit y: The mortality treatment is 3 3%. However, with appr opriate treat ment, the mo rtality rate is less than 2%. Transmissibility : There is no known person-to -person transmission. Primar y contaminations & Methods of Dissemination: Tulare mia would most likely be deliver ed via aerosolization, or sabot age of food and /or water. Secondar y Contamination & Persistence of organism: Secondar y transmission is not an issue. Howe ver, F. tularensis can persist in cold, moist environme nts for exten ded periods. Decontamin ation & Isolation: Patients - Standa rd prec autions should be practiced. Contact precautions should be used with skin lesions and secretions. Patients with direct expos ure to ae rosols, as well as their clothing, should be washed with soap and wa ter.

Outbreak co ntrol: Following an intentional rele ase, the risk of acquiring infe ction from lo cal animals is minimal. Th e risk can be further mini mized by educating the public in avoi dance of sick animals as w ell as personal pr otective measur es against bites from mosquitoes, deerf lies, or ticks. Standard levels of chlorine in municipal wate r sources sh ould protec t against wate rborne infection. In warm, arid envir onment s, organisms in the soil ar e unlikely to survive for significant periods of time a nd are unlike ly to present a ha zard. Laborator y testing: Sero logy is the most common diagnostic test ; acute and convalescent serology is the most helpful. Identificatio n of organisms by gram staining ulcer flui ds or sp utum is generally not help ful. Rapid testing of se cretions, exudat es and biopsies can be done by direct fluorescent antibody o r PCR . Routine culture is difficult due to unusu al growth re quirements an d/or ove rgrowth of commensal bacteria. Culturing is difficult and potentially dangerous. If tularemia is suspec ted, and cultures are obtained, the laborato ry should be notified because of the high risk to laboratory wo rkers due to transmissibility of the bacteria. F. tularensis can be gro wn from wounds, tissues, blood, and respir atory secretions. Therapeutic Treatment: The recommende d treatment for tularemi a in a contained casualty setting is streptomycin or gentamicin*. Alte rnate chloramphe nicol*. In a mass ca sualty setting where p atients cannot be manage d p rophylactically with doxycycline or ciprofloxacin.

Tularemia is an infectiou s disease ca used by a hardy bacterium, Francisella tularensis , found in animals ( especially rodents, rabbit s, and hares). How do pe ople become infected w ith the tul aremia bacteria? Typically, persons beco me infected through the bites of arthr opods (most commonly, ticks an d deerflies) th at have fed on an infect ed animal, by handling infected animal carcasses, by eating or drinking conta minated food or water, or by inhaling infected aer osols. Does tularemia occur naturall y in the United States and in Arizona? Yes. It is a widespread disease of a nimals. Approximately 2 00 cases of tularemia in humans are reported annually in the United States, mostly in persons living in the south-centra l and western stat es. Tularemia in humans is relatively rare in Arizo na. There were five cases reported in Arizona over the last ten years and 28 cases ove r the last tw enty-five ye ars. Nearly all cases occur in rural areas and are associated with the bites of infective ticks and biting flie s or with the handling of inf ected rodent s, rabbits, or hares. Occasional ca ses result from inhaling infectiou s aerosols an d from laboratory accide nts. Why are w e concerned about tularemia as a biological weapon? Francisella t ularensis is highly infectious: a small number of bacteria (10 -50 organisms) can cause disea se. If F. tular ensis were used as a biological wea pon, it would likely be spread through the air as an aer osol. Person s who inhale an infectiou s aerosol w ould generally experience severe respiratory illness, in cluding life-threatening pneumonia and syste mic disease, if they were no t treated. Th e bacteria th at cause tularemia occur widely in nature and could be isolated and grown in quantity in a labo ratory, although manufacturing an ef fective aerosol weapon would require considerable sop histicat ion. Can someone become infected with the tularemia bacteria from another person? No. Infected individuals have not been known to transmit the infection, so infected p ersons do not need to be isolated. How quickl y would so meone become sick if the y were exposed to the tularemia bacteria? The incubation period fo r tularemia is typically 3 to 5 days, with a range o f 1 to 14 days. Update d August 2004 Page 4. 22 Arizona Department o f Health Services Division of Public Health S ervices Office o f Public Health Emerg ency Prepare dness and Response Frequently Asked Ques tions About Tularemia (conti nued from previ ous page) Update d August 2004 Page 4. 23 Arizona Department o f Health Services What are the signs and s ymptoms of tularemia? Depending on the route of exposure, the tularemia bacteria may cause skin ulcers, swollen and painful lymph gland s, inflamed eyes, sore thr oat, oral ulcers, or pne umonia. If the bacteria were inhaled, symptoms would incl ude the abrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, jo int pain, dry cough, and progressive weakness. Pe rsons with p neumonia can develop chest pain, diff iculty breathing, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure. Forty percent or more of persons with the lung and systemic forms of the disease may die if they are not treated with appropriate antibiotics. What should someone do if the y suspect the y or others have been exposed to the tularemia bacteria? Seek prompt medical att ention. If a p erson has b een exposed to Francisella tularensis , treatment with tetracycline antibiotics is often re commended . Local and st ate health d epartments should be immediately notified so a n investigation and control act ivities can beg in quickly. If the expos ure is thought to be due to criminal activity (bioterrorism), local and state healt h departments will notif y CDC, the FBI, and other appropriate authorities. How is tula remia diagnosed? When tulare mia is healt hcare worker will colle ct specimens, such as blood or spu tum, from th e patient for testing in a diagnostic o r reference laboratory. Laboratory test result s for tularemia may be pres umptive or confirmatory. Sometimes presumptive (preliminary) identifica tion may take only a few hours, but confirmatory testing will usually take longer. Can tularemia be effectivel y treated with anti biotics? Yes. After potential exposure or dia gnosis, ear ly treatment i s recommen ded with an antibiotic from the tetracycline (su ch as doxycycline) or fluoroquinolon e (such as ciprofloxacin) class. Other antibiotics su ch as streptomycin or genta micin, are also effective, but can only be given intramuscularly or intravenously. Sensitivity te sting of the tularemia bacterium can be done to determine which antibiotics would be most effective. How long c an Francisella tularensis exist in the environment? Francisella t ularensis can remain alive for weeks in water a nd soil. Is there a vaccine avai lable for tularemia? A vaccine for tularemia is available f or use in lab oratory work ers, but it is not licen sed for general use.

Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) refer to a group of illnesses that are caused by several distinct families of viruses. In general, the term \"viral hemorrhagic fever\" is used to describe a severe multisystem syndrome (multisystem in that mult iple organ systems in the body are affected). Characteristically, the overall vascular system is damaged, and the body's ability to regulate itself is impaired. These symptoms are often acco mpanied by hemorrhage (bleeding); however, the bleeding is itself rarely life-threatening. While some types of hemorrhagic fever viruses can cause relatively mild illnesses, many of these vi ruses cause severe, life-threatening disease. How are hemorrhagic fever viruses grouped? VHFs are caused by viruses of four distinct families: filoviruses, bunyaviruses, and flaviviruses. share a number of features: They are all RNA viruses, and all are covered, or enveloped, in a fatty (lipid) coating. Their survival is dependent on an animal or in sect host, called the natural reservoir. The viruses are geographically restricted to the areas where their host species live. Humans are not the natural reservoir for any of these viruses. Humans are infected when they come into contact with infected hosts. However, with some viruses, after the accidental transmission from the host, humans can transmit the virus to one another. Human cases or outbreaks of hemorrhagic fevers caused by these viruses occur sporadically and irregularly. The occurrence of outbreaks cannot be easily predicted. With a few noteworthy exceptions, there is no cure or established drug treatment for VHFs. In rare cases, other viral and bacterial infections can cause a hemorrhagic fever; scrub typhus is a good example. What carries viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fevers? Viruses associated with most VHFs are zoonotic. This means that these viruses naturally reside in an animal reservoir host or arthropod vector. They are totally dependent on their hosts for replication and overall survival. For the most part, rodents and arthropods are the main reservoirs for viruses causing VHFs. The multimammate rat, cotton rat, deer mouse, house mouse, and other field rodents are examples of reservoir hosts. Ar thropod ticks and mosquitoes serve as vectors for some of the illnesses. However, the hosts of some viruses remain unknown -- Ebola and Marburg viruses are well-known examples. Where are cases of viral hemorrhagic fever found? Taken together, the viruses that cause VHFs are distributed over much of the globe. However, because each virus is associated with one or more particular host species, the virus and the disease it causes are usually seen only where the host species live(s). Some hosts, such as the rodent species carrying several of the New World arenaviruses, live in geographically restricted areas. Therefore, the risk of getting VHFs caused by these viruses is restricted to those areas. Other hosts range over continents, such as the rodents that carry viruses which cause various Frequently Asked Questions About Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (continued from previous page) Updated August 2004 Page 4.28 Arizona Department of Health Services Division of Public Health Services Office of Public Health Emerg ency Preparedness and Response forms of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in No rth and South America, or the different set of rodents that carry viruses which cause hemorrhagi c fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe and Asia. A few hosts are distributed nearly worldwide, such as the common rat. It can carry Seoul virus, a cause of HFRS; therefore, humans can get HFRS anywhere where the common rat is found. People usually become infected with hemorrhagic fevers only in areas where the specific host lives. However, people can be infected by an animal or insect exported from its native habitat. For example, Marburg virus outbreaks occurred in Yugoslavia, and in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany when laboratory workers handled infected imported monkeys. Also, human travel can spread hemorrhagic fever beyond its natural habitat. In 1996, a health care worker in Gabon unknowingly became infected with Ebola hemorrhagic fever (Ebola HF). He later traveled to South Africa, required hospitalization, and fatally infected a nurse. As world-wide travel increases, so does the risk of spread of unusual infections such as hemorrhagic fevers. How are hemorrhagic fever viruses transmitted? Viruses causing hemorrhagic fever are initially transmitted to humans when the activities of infected reservoir hosts or vectors and humans overlap. The viruses carried in rodent reservoirs are transmitted when humans have contact with urine, fecal matter, saliva, or other body excretions from infected rodents. The viruses associated with arthropod vectors are spread most often when the vector mosquito or tick bites a human, or when a human crushes a tick. However, some of these vectors may spread virus to animals, livestock, for example. Humans then become infected when they care for or slaughter the animals. Some viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever can spread from one person to another, once an initial person has become infected. Ebola, Marburg, Lassa and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses are examples. This type of secondary transmission of the virus can occur directly, through close contact with infected people or their body fluids. It can also occur indirectly, through contact with objects contaminated with infected body fluids. For example, contaminated syringes and needles have played an important role in spreading infection in outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever and Lassa fever. What are the symptoms of viral hemorrhagic fever illnesses? Specific signs and symptoms vary by the type of VH F, but initial signs and symptoms often include marked fever, fatigue, dizziness, muscle aches, loss of strength, and exhaustion. Patients with severe cases of VHF often show signs of bleeding under the skin, in internal organs, or from body orifices like the mouth, eyes, or ears. However, although they may bleed from many sites around the body, patients rarely die because of blood loss. Severely ill patient cases may also show shock, nervous system malfunction, coma, delirium, and seizures. Some types of VHF are associated with renal (kidney) failure. How are patients with viral hemorrhagic fever treated? Patients receive supportive therapy, but generally speaking, there is no other treatment or established cure for VHFs. Ribavirin, an anti-viral drug, has been effective in treating some individuals with Lassa fever or HFRS. Treatment with convalescent-phase plasma has been used with success in some patients with Argentine hemorrhagic fever. Frequently Asked Questions About Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (continued from previous page) Updated August 2004 Page 4.29 Arizona Department of Health Services Division of Public Health Services Office of Public Health Emerg ency Preparedness and Response How can cases of viral hemorrhagic fever be prevented and controlled? With the exception of yellow fever and Argentine hemorrhagic fever, for which vaccines have been developed, no vaccines exist that can protect agains t these diseases. Therefore, prevention efforts must concentrate on avoiding contact with the animals or insects that carry the infection. If a case of human VHF does occur, efforts should focus on preventing further transmission. Because many of the hosts that carry hemorrhagic fever viruses are rodents, disease prevention efforts include: controlling rodent populations; discouraging rodents from entering or living in homes or workplaces; encouraging safe cleanup of rodent nests and droppings. For hemorrhagic fever viruses spread by insects, prevention efforts often focus on community-wide insect control such as spraying and eliminating breeding places. In addition, people are encouraged to use personal protective measures, such as insect repellant, proper clothing, bednets, window screens, and other insect barriers to avoid being bitten. For hemorrhagic fever viruses that can be transmitted from one person to another, the most important infection control measure is to avoid close physical contact with infected people and their body fluids. Proper infection control techniques include isolating infected individuals and wearing protective clothing. Other infection control recommendations include the proper use, disinfection, and disposal of instruments and equipment used in treating or caring for patients with VHF, such as needles and thermometers. The World Health Organization and CDC have developed practical, hospital-based guidelines, titled Infection Control for Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers In the African Health Care Setting. This manual can help health-care facilities with few financial resources to recognize cases and prevent further hospital-based disease transmission using locally available materials. What needs to be done to address the threat of viral hemorrhagic fevers? Scientists and researchers are challenged with developing containment, treatment, and vaccine strategies for these diseases. Another goal is to develop immunologic and molecular tools for more rapid disease diagnosis, and to study how the viruses are transmitted and exactly how the disease affects the body (pathogenesis). A third goal is to understand the ecology of these viruses and their hosts in order to offer preventive public health advice for avoiding infection. For more information call Agent: Brucellosis is a systemic zoonotic disease caused four Brucella species: B. melitensis,B . abortus, B. suis, and B. canis . The organism is a small, gram-negative aerobic co ccobacillus th at grows within monocytes and macrophages. Routes of Exposure: Transmission t o humans occurs throug h (a) direct contact of inf ected tissue or body fluids with broke n skin or conjunctivae, ( b) inhalation of infected aerosols, or (c) ingestion of raw infect ed meat or unpasteurized dairy produc ts. The primary rese rvoirs are goats, cattle, sheep, pigs and camels although animals such a s elk, caribo u, bison, de er and wild and domestic canine animals may be infected. Sp ecifica lly, ca ttle and goat s can carry B. melitensis , cattle can carry B. abortus , pigs can serve as reservoirs for B. suis , and dogs can serve as a reservoir for B. canis. Infective Dose & Infectivity : 10-10 0 organisms Incubation Period: Often 1-2 months, range 5 days to several months. Clinical Effects: Brucellosis is a sy stemic infect ion characte rized by an undulant fever pattern. I t typically presents as an acute non-specific f ebrile illness wit h chills, swe ats, headache, fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, an d anorexia. Approximatel y 15-25% of infected i ndividuals will have coug h. A normal chest radiogra ph is often p resent. Lymphadenopathy is presen t in 10-20% of patients, and rare endocarditis. Routine labs are usually non-specific. In a nimals, abortion is the m ost obvious manifestatio n of the dise ase in females and epididymitis in males. T he organism is shed in the milk, feta l membrane s, and uterin e discharges. Thus brucellosis can be both an occupat ional (veterinarians, farmers) or a foodborne disease. Lethality : Brucellosis ha s a very low mortality rat e, less than 5% of untreated cases, with most deaths caused by endocarditis or meningitis. Transmissibility : Perso n-to-person transmissio n sis extremely rare. Primary Contaminations & Metho ds of Dissemination: Likely methods of dissemination would either be thr ough aeroso lization or sabotage of f ood. Decontamination & Isolation: Patients can b e managed using stand ard precautions. Contact precautions are suggest ed if drainin g lesions ar e present. No airborne isolation is re quired.

Brucellosis is an infect ious disea se caused by the bacteria of the genus Brucella . These bacteria are primarily passed among animals, and they cause di sease in many different vertebrates. Various Brucella species affe ct sheep, goats, cattle, deer, elk, pig s, dogs, and se veral other animals. Humans become infect ed by coming in contact with animals or animal products that are contaminated with these bacteria. In humans brucellosis can cause a ran ge of sympt oms that are similar to th e flu and may include fever, sweats, headaches, back pain s, and physical weakness. Sever infections of the central nervous systems or lining of t he heart may occur. Brucellosis can also cau se long-lasting or chronic sympto ms that include re current fevers, joint pa in, and fatigue . How comm on is brucellosis? Brucellosis is not very common in th e United States, where only 100 to 200 cases o ccur each year. But brucello sis can be very common in countrie s where animal disease control progr ams have n ot reduced the amount of disease among animals. Where is brucellosis usuall y foun d? Although brucellosis ca n be found worldwide, it is more co mmon in co untries that do not have standardize d and effective public he alth and do mestic animal health pro grams. Areas currently listed as hig h risk are th e Mediterranean Basin (Portugal, Spain, Southern France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, North Africa), South and Central America, Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, an d the Middle East. Unpast eurized che eses, somet imes called \"village che eses,\" from these areas may represe nt a particular risk for to urists. How is bru cellosis transmitted to humans, and who is li kely to bec ome infected? Humans are generally infected in on e of three ways: eating or drinking something that is contaminated with Brucella , breathin g in the orga nism (inhala tion), or having the bacte ria enter the body through skin woun ds. The most common way to be infected is by e ating or drin king contaminated milk products. When sheep, goats, cows, or ca mels are infected, their milk is contaminated with the bacteria. If th e milk is not pasteurized, these bacte ria can be tr ansmitted to persons wh o drink the milk or eat cheeses made it. Inhalation of Brucella organisms is not a common rou te of infectio n, but it can be a signif icant hazard f or people in certain occu pations, su ch as those wo rking in labo ratories where the organism is cultur ed. Inhalatio n is often re sponsible for a significant p ercentage of cases in ab attoir em ployees. Contamination of skin wounds may be a problem for persons working in slaug hterhouses or meat packing plant s or for veterinarians. Hunters ma y be infected through skin wounds o r by acciden tally ingestin g the bacteria after cleaning de er, elk, moose, or wild pi gs that they have killed.

Direct perso n-to-person spread of br ucellosis is extremel y rare. Mothers who are breast-feeding may trans mit the infectio n to their inf ants. Sexual transmissio n has also b een reported. Although uncommon, transmissio n may also occur via co ntaminated tissue tran splantation. Is there a wa y to preve nt infection? Yes. Do not consume unpasteurized milk, cheese , or ice crea m while traveling. If you are not sure that the dair y product is pasteurized, don't eat it. Hunters and animal herdsman should use rubbe r gloves when handling eviscerating animals. There is no vaccine available for humans. My dog has been diagnosed with brucellosis. Is that a risk for me? B. canis is the specie s of Brucella species that can infect d ogs. This species ha s occasionally been transmitted to humans, but the vast majority of dog infection s do not result in human illness. Although veterinarians e xposed to blood of infect ed animals are at risk, p et owners are not considered t o be at risk f or infection. This is par tly because it is unli kely that they will come in contact with blood, semen, or placent a of the dog. The bacteria may be cleared from the animal within a few days of treatment; howe ver re-infection is common and some animal body fluids may be infectiou s for weeks. Immunoco mpromised persons (ca ncer patient s, HIV-infect ed individuals, or transplantation patients) should not h andle dogs known to be infected wit h B. canis . How is bru cellosis dia gnosed? Brucellosis is diagnosed in a laborat ory by finding Brucella organisms in samples of blood or bon e marrow. Als o, blood test s can be do ne to detect antibodies a gainst the b acteria. If this method is used, two blood samples should be collected 2 weeks apart . Is there a treatment for brucellosis? Yes, but tre atment can be difficu lt. Doctors can prescribe ef fective antibiotics. Usually, doxycycline and rifampin are used in combination for 6 weeks to prevent reoccurring infection. De pending on the timing of treatment and severity of illness, re covery may take a few weeks to sev eral months. The death rate from brucellosis is very low.

Two serogroups have been identified as causing symptoms in humans: O1 a nd O139. These organisms grow best at a pH of 7.0 but are able to tolerate a n alkaline environment. Rather than invading the intestina l mucosa, they adhere to it. The clinical syndrome is caused by the action of the cholera t oxin. Route of Exposure: Ingestion of wa ter or food contaminated with choler a organisms. Infective Dose & Infectivity : 10 to 500 organisms Incubation Period: The incubation period for ch olera ranges from four hours to five days with an average of 2-3 days. Clinical Effects: Sudden onset of vomiting, abdominal dist ension, hea dache and p ain with little or no fever. These symptoms are followed rapidly by profuse watery diarrhea with a \"rice water\" appearance (colorless with small flecks of mucou s). Fluid loss may exce ed five to ten liters a da y, and death can result fro m dehydrati on, hypovol emia and shock. In ch ildren, coma, seizures and hypoglycemi a can occur. Lethality : If appropriately treated the mortality rate is less tha n 1%. However, if untreated the mortality rat e may e xceed 50%. Transmissibility : Chole ra is not easily spread from person to person; inf ected food h andlers can contaminate foods and d rinks; in ord er to be an effective biological weap on, major drinking water supplies wo uld need to be heavily contaminated. Primary Contamination & Method s of Dissemination: Natural disse mination is t hrough fecal contamination of food o r water supply. Secondary Contamination & Persi stence of organism: Diarrheal fluid s are highly infective, however, th e organism is easily ki lled by desicca tion. It is not viable in p ure water but will survive up to 24 hou rs in sewag e and as lon g as six weeks in water containing or ganic matter. Vibrio cholerae can also withst and freezing for 3 to 4 d ays. Decontamination & Isolation: Patients - Patients with cholera and uncontrolled diarrhea sh ould be managed using contact precautions that means usin g gloves and gowns for any contact with the patient or his environment . Good hand washing b efore and af ter gl ove use is essentia l to prevent spread of pathogens. Diapered or incontinent patients sho uld remain on contact isolation for th e duration of diarrhea symptoms. No airborne isolation of pa tients is necessary.

Cholera is a n acute, diar rheal illne ss caused by i nfection of t he intestine with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae . The infection is often mild or without symptoms, but sometimes it can be se vere. Approximat ely 1 in 20 infected persons has sev ere disease characterize d by profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In these persons , rapid lo ss of body fluids leads t o dehydration and shock. Without trea tment, death can occur within hours. How does a person get cholera? A person may get cholera by drinking water or eat ing food contaminated with the ch olera bacterium. In an epide mic, the sou rce of the co ntamination is usually the feces of a n infected p erson. The disease can spread rapidly in areas with inadeq uate treatment of sewage and drinking water. The cholera bacterium may also live in the environment in brackish r ivers and coastal waters. Shellfish eat en raw have been a sour ce of choler a, and a few persons in t he United States have contracted cholera after eating raw or undercooked shellfish f rom the Gulf of Mexico. The disease is not likely to spread directly from one person to an other; therefore, casual contact with an infected person is no t a risk fa ctor for becoming ill. What is the risk for cholera in the United States? In the United States, ch olera was prevalent in the 1800s but has been virtually eliminated by modern sewage and water treatment systems. Howeve r, as a result of improved tra nsportation, more persons from the United States travel to parts of Latin America, Africa, or Asia where they are infected by cholera. In a ddition, domestic foodbo rne outbreaks in the United States h ave been caused by cholera-conta minated s eafood brought back by travelers. What should travelers do to avoid getting cholera? The risk for cholera is v ery low for U.S. travelers visiting are as with epid emic choler a. When simple precautions are observed, contractin g the disease is unlikely. All travelers to areas where cholera has occurre d should ob serve the following reco mmendation s: Drink only water that you have boiled or treated with chlorine or iodine. Other safe beverages include tea a nd coffee made with boiled water and carbonate d, bottled beverages with no ice. Eat only foods that have been thoroughly cooke d and are still hot, or fruit that you have peeled yourself. Avoid undercooked or ra w fish or sh ellfish, including ceviche . Make sure all vegetables are cooked; avoid salad s. Avoid foods and beverages from street vendors. Do not bring perishable seafood back to the Unit ed States. A simple rule of thumb is \"Boil it, cook it, peel it, or forget it. \" Update d August 2004 Page 5. 7 Arizona Department o f Health Services Division of Public Health S ervices Office o f Public Health Emerg ency Prepare dness and Response Frequently Asked Ques tions About Cholera (conti nued from previ ous page) Update d August 2004 Page 5. 8 Arizona Department o f Health Services Is a vaccin e available to prevent cholera? No cholera vaccines ar e available in the United States. Two oral vaccines are available outsid e of the United States however, they are not generally recommen ded for travelers becau se of the brief and incomplete immunit y they offer. Can cholera be treated? Cholera can be simply and succe ssfully treated by im mediate replacement of the fluid and salts lost through diar rhea. Patients can be tre ated with oral rehydration solution, a prepackage d mixture of sugar and salts to be mixed with wat er and drunk in large a mounts. This solutio n is used throug hout the world to treat diarrhe a. Severe cases also re quire intravenous fluid re placement. With prompt rehydration, fewer than 1% of cholera patients die . Antibiotics shorten the course and di minish the severi ty of th e illness, but they are not as important as rehydration. Persons who develop severe diarrhea and vomiting in countries wh ere cholera occurs sh ould seek med ical attent ion promptly. What is the U.S. government doing to combat cholera? U.S. and international p ublic healt h authorities a re working to enhance surveillance f or cholera, investigate cholera outbr eaks, and d esign and im plement preventive me asures. The Centers for Disease Control is investigating epid emic choler a wherever i t occurs and is training laboratory workers in p roper techniques for ide ntificatio n of V. cholerae . In addition, the Centers for Disease Control is pr oviding information on diagnosis, tre atment, and prevention of cholera to public healt h officials and is educat ing the public a bout effective preventive measures. The U.S. Ag ency for International Development is sponsorin g some of the internation al governme nt activities an d is providin g medical supplies to af fected count ries. The Environmental Protection Agen cy is workin g with water and sewage treatment operators in the United States to prevent contamination of water with the cholera bacteriu m.

General mal aise, fever, anorexia, nausea and vomiting occur less often. Symptoms o ften wax an d wane but remit in fewer than 30 days in most immunologically healthy pe ople. In patients who are immunocompromised, cryptosporidiosis usua lly causes chron ic diarrhea; however, rarely, lung and biliary tract disease al so occurs. Lethality : Cryptosporidiosis is rar ely lethal in healthy people. In persons with severely weakened immune sys tems, chronic gastrointe stinal ill ness or more disseminated disease can lead to complication s and death. Transmissibility : It is transmitted by ingestion of fecally co ntaminated food or water, including water swallowed while swimming; by exposure to fe cally contaminated environmental surfaces; and by the fecal-oral ro ute from person to perso n (e.g. while changing diapers caring for an infect ed person, o r engaging in certain sexu al behaviors). Primary Contamination & Method s of Dissemination: In a terrorist attack, C. parvum would most likely be disseminated through the intentional contamination of food or water supplies. Secondary Contamination & Persi stence of organism: Secondary transmission can result fro m exposure to the stool of infected individuals, bot h patients with acute infe ction and asympto matic carriers. Oo cysts, the inf ectious stage, appear in the stool at t he onset of sympto ms and are infectiou s immediately upon excretion. Oocysts continue to be excreted in the stool f or several weeks after sympto ms resolve; outside the body, they may remain infective for 2-6 months in a moist environment . Oocysts are highly resistant to che mical disinfe ctants used to purify drinking water.

Cryptosporidiosis ( krip-toe-spo-rid-e -o-sis), is a diarrheal disease cause d by a microscopic parasite, Cryptosporidiu m parvu m. It can live in t he intestine of humans and animals and is passed in th e stool of an infected per son or animal. Both the disease and the parasite are also known as \"Crypto.\" The parasite is p rotected by an out er she ll that allows it to survive outside the body for long periods of time and ma kes it very resistant to chlorine disin fection. During the past two decades, Crypto has become recognized a s one of the most common causes o f waterborne disease (drinking and re creational) in humans in the United States. The parasite is f ound in every region of the United States and throu ghout the world. What are the s ymptom s of Cry pto? Symptoms i nclude diarr hea, loose o r watery stool, stomach cramps, upset stomach, and a slight fever. Some people have no sympto ms. How long a fter infection do s ymptoms appear? Symptoms g enerally begin 2-10 days after being infected. How long will s ymptom s last? In persons with average immune s ystems, sympto ms usually last about 2 weeks; th e symptoms may go in cycles in which you may seem to get better for a f ew days, then feel worse, before th e illness ends. How is Cry pto spread? Crypto lives in the intest ine of infecte d humans or animals. Millions of Crypto can be rel eased in a bowel move ment from a n infected h uman or ani mal. You can become infected after accidentally swallowing t he parasite. Crypto may be found in soil, food, w ater, or surf aces that ha ve been contaminated with the feces from inf ected humans or animals. Crypto is not spread b y contact with blood. Crypto can be spread: By putting something in your mouth or accidenta lly swallowing something that has co me in contact with the stool of a person or animal infected with Crypto. By swallowing recreatio nal water co ntaminated with Crypto. Recreational water is water in swimming p ools, hot tub s, jacuzzis, f ountains, la kes, rivers, springs, pon ds, or strea ms that can be cont aminated with sewage or feces from humans or animals. Note: Crypto is chlorine resistant an d can live fo r days in pools. By eating uncooked food contaminated with Cryp to. Thoroughly wash with uncontaminated water all vegetables an d fruits you plan to eat r aw. See below for information on making water safe. By accidentally swallowing Crypto picked up fro m surfaces ( such as toys, bathroom fixtures, changing ta bles, diaper pails) cont aminated with stool from an infected person.

Should I worry about spreading infection to others? Yes, Crypto can be very contagious. Follow these guideline s to avoid spreading Cryp to to others. Wash your hands with soap and water after usin g the toilet, changing diapers, and b efore eating or pr eparing food . Avoid swimming in recreational wat er (pools, ho t tubs, lake s or rivers, the ocean, etc.) if you have Crypto and for at le ast 2 weeks after diarrhe a stops. You can pass C rypto in your stool and contaminate water for several weeks after your sympto ms have en ded. This ha s resulted in many out breaks of Cr ypto among recreational water users. Note: you a re not protected in a chlorinated pool because Crypto is chlorine resistant and can live for days in pools. Avoid fecal exposure during sex. Am I at risk for severe disease? Although Crypto can infect all peop le, some groups are more likely to de velop more serious illness. You ng children and pregnant women may be more susceptible t o the dehydration resulting fro m diarrhea and should drink plenty of fluids whil e ill. If you have a severely weakened imm une system, you are a t risk for mor e serious d isease. Your sympto ms may be more severe and could lead to serious o r life-threate ning illne ss. Examples of persons wit h weakened immune systems includ e those with HIV/AIDS; cancer and t ransplant patients wh o are taking certain immunosuppressive drugs; and those with inherited diseases th at affect the immune system. How is a Cr ypto infecti on diagnosed? Your health care provider will ask yo u to submit stool sampl es to see if you are infected. Becau se testing for C rypto can be difficult , you may be asked to submit several sto ol specimen s over several days. Because t ests for Crypto are not routinely done in most la boratories, your health care provider should spe cifically request testing for the parasite. What is the treatment for Cry pto? There is no consiste ntly effective treatment for Crypto. Most people with a healthy immune system will recover on their own. Drinking pl enty of fluids will help to prevent dehydration. Antidiarrheal medicine may help slow down diarrhea, but consult with your physician. Rapid loss o f fluids be cause of diarrh ea can be very serious in babies. P arents should consult their health care provider about fluid replacement therapy options for babies. Childre n should not be given antidiarrheal medicine for severe diarr hea without first consultin g their physician. People who are on medicines that w eaken their immune s ystem are at higher risk for more severe and more prolonged illn ess; treatment for them could includ e cutting back on these medicines. In addition, pat ients with HI V infection can develop chronic diarr hea from Crypto; they can be helpe d by optimizing their antire troviral medicines.

Routes of Exposure: Humans are primarily exp osed to EEE through the bite of an infected mosquito. Infective Dose & Infectivity : The infective dose is unknow n. All people are consid ered suscep tible though child ren are more likely to be severely affected. Incubation Period: The incubation period is varies from 5-15 days. Clinical Effects: The illness is characterized by rapid onset of high fever, vomiting, stiff neck, a nd drowsiness. Children frequently man ifest general ized, facial, or periorbital edema. Mo tor involvement with paresis is common during the a cute phase of the illne ss. Major dist urbances of autonomic function, su ch as impaired respiratory regulation o r excess salivation may dominate the clinical pictu re. Adults typically exhibit a f ebrile pr odrome for up to 11 days before the onset of neurological disease; ho wever, illness in chi ldren exhibits a more sudden onset. Up to 30% of survivors are left with n eurological sequelae su ch as se izures, spast ic paralysis, an d cranial neuropathie s. Cognitive impairment ranges from minimal brain dysfunctio n to severe dementia. Lethality : Fatality rates for EEE are estimated to be from 50% to 75%. Mortality rat es are highest among youn g children a nd the elderly. Transmissibility : EEE infection occurs when a person is b itten by an infected mosquito. The virus is not directly t ransmitted from person-to-person. Primary contaminations & Metho ds of Dissemination: As a bioterrorism weapon, EEE would most likely be delivered via ae rosolizat ion. Secondary Contamination & Persi stence of organism: Secondary transmission d oes not occur and EEE particles are not considered to be stable in the environment.

Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) is a mosquito -borne viral disease. As t he name suggests, EEE occurs in the eastern ha lf of the US. Because of t he high case fatality rate, it is regar ded as one of the more serious mosquito-borne diseases in the United States. How do people become infected w ith EEE virus? EEE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of an inf ected mosquito. Several species of mosquitoes can become infected wit h EEE virus. The main EEE transmission cycle is between birds and mosquitoes. H orses can also become in fected with, and die from, EEE virus infection. What causes EEE? EEE is caused by a viru s that is a m ember of the family Togaviridae , genus Alphavir us. It is closely relat ed to Weste rn and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses. What ty pe of illness can occur? Symptoms can range from mild flu-like illness to e ncephaliti s (inflammation of the brain ), coma, and death. Among those who are recognized to have infection the death rate is 50-7 5%, making it one of the most deadly mosquito-borne diseases in the US. It is estimated that 30 % of people who survive EEE will have neurologic deficits. How common is EEE? Human cases occur relatively infrequently, largely because the cycle of infection be tween mosquito and birds take s place in swamp areas that humans tend to avoid. There are an average of 4 EEE cases in the U S each year. The states with most cases are Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. Who is at risk for developing EEE? Persons over age 50 and younger than age 15 seem to be at greatest risk for developing severe disease. Re sidents of a nd visitors t o areas with an established presence of the virus are at increased risk, as are p eople who engage in out door work and recreatio nal activities. How can people avoid i nfection with EEE virus ? Though a vaccine is available to prot ect horses, t here is no licensed vaccine for human use. To avoid infection people should avoid mosquit o bites by employing pe rsonal and h ousehold protection measures, su ch repell preca utions from dusk to daw n when mosquitoes are most likely to bite, and controlling standing wa ter that can provide mos quito breeding sites.

It is a cause of wound infections and food po isoning in humans. C. perfringens spores are ubiquitous in the enviro nment. When the spores a re injected o r inoculated into a wound, bacteria g row and produce toxins. Epsilon toxin is one of t he toxins of type B and type D strains of C. perfringens . Epsilon toxin has been suggested a s a potential biologica l weapon. Epsil on toxin damages cell walls and ca uses potassium and fluid lea kage from cells. Routes of Exposure: C. perfringens usually cau ses infe ction s in humans by contamination of foo d, or by inoculatio n into an op en wound. Exposure to eps ilon toxin could be spread by aerosolizat ion or by adding it to f ood or water. Infective Dose & Infectivity : C. pe rfringens is normal flora in the human intestina l tract. However, when large numbers of C. perfringens grow in inadequately stored food, or when it contaminates an open wound, clinical sympto ms develop. Incubation Period: The incubation period for g astrointest inal symptoms after oral ingestion of C. perfringens is usually 10 -12 hours, with a range o f 6-24 hours. The incub ation period of epsilon toxin after respiratory or oral exposure is not kno wn. Clinical Effects: C. perfringens gastroenteritis can include d iarrhea, nau sea, severe abdominal cramps and bloating for 1-2 days. Vomiting and feve r are not usually see n. Wound contamination can result in clostrid ial myonecrosis ( gas gangren e), or clostridial cellulit is. Type B and D strains, th e strains tha t produce ep silon toxin, d o not usually infect humans. C. perfringens type B causes severe gastroenteritis in young calves, foals, la mbs and piglets. Type D causes ente rotoxemia in sheep and goats. Intra venous injection of epsilon toxin animals has resulted in p ulmonary ed ema and neurologic sy mptoms. The sympto ms in huma ns from intentional exposure to epsilon toxin is n ot known. Extrapolating from animal experiments , pulmonary edema, neurol ogic symptoms, or gastroenteritis could be seen.

Clostridium perfringens are spore-fo rming bacteria that can b e found in soil, fece s, and the intestine s of healthy people and animals. Clostridium perfrin gens are also often foun d in raw meat and poultry. The bacteria often cause food poisoning, b ut can also infect wounds. How is Clostridium perfringens spread? Eating foods that are ser ved after improper stora ge can lead to infection. After cookin g, small numbers of the organism may still be present. Th ese can gro w and produce toxin when the temperature is kept betw een 70\u00b0 and 140\u00b0 F. and air and moisture levels are right. F or example, this can o ccur when foods that are cooked in lar ge quantitie s are then h eld at room temperature for a prolon ged period o f time. Clostridium perfri ngens food poisoning is more common with meat products an d gravies. The bacteria can be foun d in uncooked meat and poultry. It can also be transferred t o food from stool bacter ia if proper h and washin g is not practiced. What illness does Clostridium perfringens cause? Clostridium perfringens most often causes food poisoning th at results in sudden, watery diarrhea and abdominal pain. Usually there is no fever and no vomiting. On very rare occasions Clostridium perfringens can cause a more severe infection t hat causes t he intestina l tissue to d ie and results in an infectio n of the bloo d. Wounds that become contaminated with Clostridium perfringens can result in tissue de cay. How is Clostridium perfringens infection diagnosed? Clostridium perfringens is initia lly dia gnosed based on sympt oms. Laboratory confirmation is made by fin ding high co ncentrations of Clostridiu m perfringens in food or stools.

Escherichia coli O157:H7 is one of h undreds of strains of the bacterium Escherich ia coli. Although most strains are harmless and live in the intestine s of healthy humans and animals, this strain produces a powerful toxin and can cause severe illness. E. coli O157 :H7 was first recognized as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea; the out break was tr aced to cont aminated hamburgers. Since then, most infect ions have come f rom eating undercooked ground beef. The combination of lette rs and numbers in the na me of the bacterium refers to the spe cific marker s found on its surface and distinguishe s it from other types of E. coli. How is E. coli O157:H7 spread? The organism can be found on a small number of cattle farms and can live in the inte stines of he althy cattle. Meat can become contaminated during slaughter, and organisms can be thor oughly mixe d into beef when it is ground. Bacteria pre sent on the cow's udder s or on equipment ma y get into raw milk. Eating meat, especia lly ground beef, that has no t been cooked sufficientl y to kill E. coli O157:H7 can cause infe ction. Contaminated meat looks and smells normal. Although t he number of organisms required to cause disea se is not kno wn, it is su spected to be very s mall. Among othe r occasion al sources of infection are sprouts, lett uce, salami, unpasteurized milk and juice, and swimming in or drinking sewage-contaminated water. Bacteria in d iarrheal stoo ls of infe cted persons can be passe d from one person to an other if hygiene or handwashing habits are inadequ ate. This is particu larly likely among toddlers wh o are not toilet trained. Fa mily me mbers and playmates of these children are at high risk of becom ing infected. What illness does E. coli O157:H7 cause? E. coli O157 :H7 infection often cause s severe blo ody diarrhea and abdominal cramps; sometimes the infection causes nonblo ody diarrhea or no sympt oms. Usually little or no fever is present, and the illness resolves in 5 to 10 days. In some persons, particularly childr en under 5 years of age and the elde rly, the infection can also cause a co mplication called hemolytic uremic syndrome, in which the re d blood cells are destroyed and the kidn eys fail. About 2%-7% of infection s lead to this co mplication. I n the United States, hemolytic uremic syndrome is the principal cau se of acute kid ney failure in children, a nd most cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome are caused by E. coli O157:H7.

There is no evidence that antibiotics improve the course of di sease, and t here is a co ncern that tr eatment with antibiotics may lead to kidney complications. Antidi arrheal ag ents, such a s loperamide (Imodium), should also be avoided. Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a potentially life- threatening. Blood transfu sions and kidney dialysis are often required. With intensive ca re, the deat h rate for hemolytic uremic syndrome is 3%-5%. What are the long-term consequences of infection? Persons who only have diarrhea without HUS u sually recover completely. Patients with HUS ca n develop to high blood pr essure or ch ronic renal f ailure. Lethality : The overall mortality rate for E. coli O157:H7 is <1 %. For those who develop HUS, the death rate is between 3-5%. What can be done to prevent E. coli O157:H7 infection? There are several things you can do to reduce your risk of infection: Cook all gro und beef an d hamburger thoroughly. Keep raw meat separate from ready-to-eat foods. Wash hands, counter top s, and utensils with hot soapy water after they touch raw me at. Drink only pasteurized milk, juice, o r cider. Wash fruits and vegetables thorough ly, especiall y those that will not be cooked. Drink municipal water that has been treated with chlorine or o ther effective disinfe ctants. Avoid swallowing lake or pool water while swimming. Make sure that persons with diarrhea, especia lly children, w ash their ha nds carefully with soap after bowel move ments to reduce th e risk of spreading infection, and tha t persons w ash hands after changing soiled d iapers. Anyone with a diarrheal illness should avoid swimmi ng in pu blic pools or lakes, sharing baths wit h others, and preparing fo od for others.

Glanders is an infectiou s disease th at is cau sed by the bacterium Burkholderia m allei. Glanders is primarily a disease but it also af fects donke ys and mules and can b e naturally contracted b y goats, dogs, and cats. Human infection, althou gh not seen in the Unite d States since 1945, has occurre d rarely and sporadically among laboratory workers and those in direct and prolong ed contact with infected , domestic a nimals. Why has gl anders become a current issue? Burkholderia m allei is an organism that is associated with inf ections in la boratory workers because so very fe w organisms are required to cause disea se. The organism has be en considered as a potential agent for biologica l warfare and of biologica l terrorism. How comm on is glanders? The United States has n ot seen any naturally occurring case s since the 1940s. However, it is still commonly s een among domestic an imals in Africa , Asia, the Middle East, and Central and South America. How is glan ders transmitted and w ho can ge t it? Glanders is transmitted to humans by direct cont act with infe cted animals. The bacte ria enter the body through the skin a nd through mucosal sur faces of the eyes and nose. The spor adic cases have been documented in veterinarians, horse ca retakers, an d laboratoria ns. What are the s ymptom s of glanders? The sympto ms of glanders depend upon the route of infection with the organism. The types of infection include localize d, pus-forming cutaneou s infections, pulmonary i nfections, b loodstream infection s, and chronic suppurative infections of the skin. Ge neralized sy mptoms of g landers include feve r, muscle aches, chest p ain, muscle tightness, a nd headach e. Additional sympto ms have includ ed excessive tearing of t he eyes, lig ht sensit ivity, and diarrh ea. Localized inf ections - If there is a cut or scratch in the skin, a localized inf ection with ulceration will develop within 1 to 5 d ays at the site where the bacteria ent ered the body. Swollen lymph nodes may also be apparent. Inf ections involving the mu cous membranes in the eyes, nose, and resp iratory tract will cause increased mucus product ion from the affected sites. Pulmonary infections - In pulmonary infection s, pneumonia, pulmonary a bscesse s, and pleural effusion can occur. Che st X-rays will show local ized infect ion in the lobe s of the lung s. Bloodstrea m infections - Glanders bloodstream infection s are usually fa tal within 7 t o 10 days.

Geographically, the dise ase is ende mic in Africa , Asia, the Middle East, a nd Central and South America. How is glan ders diagnosed? The disease is diagno sed in the labo ratory by isolating Burkh olderia m allei from blood, sputum, urine, or skin lesions. Serologic assays are not available. Can glanders spread from person to person? In addition t o animal exposure, cases of human-to-human transmission have been reported. These case s included two suggest ed cases of sexual transmission and several cases in family members who cared for the patients. Is there a wa y to preve nt infection? There is no vaccine available for gla nders. In co untries where glanders is endemic in animals, prevention of the disease in humans involves identif icatio n and elimination of the inf ection in the animal population. Within the health care setting, transmissio n can be pre vented by u sing common blo od and body fluid precau tions. Is there a treatment for glanders? Because hu man cases of glanders are rare, there is limited information about antibiot ic treatment of the organism in huma ns.

Routes of Exposure: Humans are primarily exp osed to meli oidosis t hrough direct contact with a contaminated source, su ch as so il or stagnant su rface water. Infective Dose & Infectivity : The infective dose is assumed to be low and all peop le are considered susceptible. In asympto matic individuals severe injuries, bur ns, or debilit ating disea se may Incubation Period: The incubation period can b e as short a s 2 days. However, years may elap se between the presumed exposure and the appearance of clinical disea se. Clinical Effects: The clinical manife stations of melioidosis include local skin infe ction, lung involvement, bacteremia, chronic suppurative infection in ma ny organ systems, and neurologic infection. T he most likely presentation due to bioterrorism would be pulmonary infe ction due to aerosolized bacteria. In halational melioidosis is an acute pyogenic process that can resemble plague pneu monia, with fever, severe systemic sympto ms, and consolid ative pneumonia. Secondary bacteremia can result in a papular o r pustular ra sh that rese mbles smallpox lesions. Chest X -rays can show a variety of infiltrates, oft en upper lob e infiltrate s that cavitate. Lethality : Mortality from severe pneumonia and septicemia may be as high as 50%. I n localized skin disease the mortality is low. Transmissibility : Infection with B. pseudom allei generally occurs when contaminated soil or wat er comes in co ntact with la cerated or a braded skin. Melioidosis can also be acquired thr ough aspirat ion or ingestion of water or inhalation of dust contaminated with t he organism. Person-to-person transmissio n through direct contact may also be possible . Primary contaminations & Metho ds of Dissemination: As a bioterrorism weapon, melioidosis would most likely be delivered via ae rosolizat ion. Secondary Contamination & Persi stence of organism: Only three cases of se condary infection have been reported.

Melioidosis is an infect ious disea se caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudom allei. Melioidosis is predominately a disease of tropi cal climates, especially in S outheast Asia. The bacteria cau sing melioid osis are fou nd in conta minated water and soil. They are spread to humans and animals through direct contact with the contaminated source. Glanders is spread to humans from infected domestic animals. Why has m elioidosis b ecome a current issue? Burkholderia pseudom allei is an org anism that has been con sidered as a potential ag ent for biologica l warfare and biologica l terrorism. How comm on is melioi dosis and w here is it f ound? Melioidosis is endemic in Southeast Asia, with t he greatest concentratio n of cases r eported in Vietnam, Ca mbodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), and northern Australia. Additionally, it is seen in the South Pacific, Africa , India, and t he Middle East. In many of these countries, Burkholderia pseudom allei is so prevalent that it is a common contaminate found on laboratory cultures. Moreover, it has been a common pathogen isolated f rom troops of all nationalitie s that have served in areas with ende mic disease. A few isolat ed cases of melioidosis have occurred in the W estern Hemisphere in Mexico, Panama, Ecuador, Haiti, Brazil, Peru, Guyana, an d in the stat es of Hawaii and Georgia. In the United States, confirmed cases range from none to five each year and occur among travelers and immigrants. How is meli oidosis transmitted and who can get it? Besides hu mans, many animal spe cies are susceptible to melioidosis. These inclu de sheep, goats, horse s, swine, cat tle, dogs, an d cats. Tr ansmission occurs by direct contact with contaminated soil and surface waters. In Southe ast Asia, the organism has been rep eatedly isolated fro m agriculture fields, with infection o ccurring primarily during the rainy season. Humans and animals are believed to acquire the infection by inhalatio n of dust, in gestion of contaminated water, and contact with contaminated soil esp ecially through skin abrasion s, and for military troops, by contamination of war wounds. Perso n-to-person transmissio n can occur. What are the s ymptom s of melioidosis? Illness from melioidosis can be as a cute or loca lized infe ction, acute pulmonary infection, a cute bloodstr infectio n, and chron ic suppurat ive infection. Inapparent infections ar e also possible. The incub ation period (time betwe en exposure and appearance of clinical sympto ms) is not clear ly defined, but may range f rom 2 days t o many years.

The onset of pulmonary melioidosis is typically accompanied by a high fever, headache, anorexia, and gene ral muscle soreness. Ch est pain is common, but a nonproductive or productive cough with normal sputum is the hallmark of t his form of melioidosis. Acute blood stream infection - Patien ts with unde rlying illness such as HI V, renal failu re, and diabete s are at high er risk for th is form of disease, which usually results in sept ic shock. The sympto ms of the bloodst ream infection vary dep ending on th e site of orig inal infection, bu t they generally include r espiratory distress, severe headache , fever, diarrhea, developmen t of pus-fille d lesions on the ski n, muscle tender ness, and disorientation, and abscesses f ound throughout the bod y. Chronic sup purative infe ction - Chronic melioido sis is an infe ction that in volves the organs of the body. These typically include t he joints, vi scera, lymph nodes, skin, brain, liver, lung, bones, and spleen. How is meli oidosis diagnosed? Melioidosis is diagnosed by isolating Burkholderia pseudom from the blood, urine, sputum, or skin le sions. Detecting a nd measuring antibodies to the bacte ria in the blo od is anothe r means of diagnosis. Can melioidosis be spread from person to person? Melioidosis can spread f rom person to person by contact with the blood a nd body fluids of an infected per son. Two documented cases of male-to-female sexual transmission involved males with chronic prostate infe ction due to melioidosis. Is there a wa y to preve nt infection? There is no vaccine for melioidosis. Prevention of the infection in endemic-disea se areas can be difficult since contact wit h contaminated soil is so common. Persons with diabetes an d skin lesions shou ld avoid con tact with soil and standin g water in these areas. Wearing bo ots during agricultural work can prevent infection through t he feet and lower legs. I n health car e settings, using common blood an d body fluid precautions can prevent transmissio n. Is there a treatment for melioidosis? Most cases of melioidosis can be tre ated with appropriate an tibiotics. Tre atment should be initiated early in the course of the disease.

Infective Dose & Infectivity : The infective dose is unknow n and all pe ople are con sidered susceptible, though older adults may be more severely affected. Incubation Period: The incubation period rang es from 1 to 4 weeks. Clinical Effects: An acute, generalized chlamydial disea se with variable clinical presentations; fever, headache, rash, myalgia, chills, and upper or lower respiratory tract disease are common. Respiratory sympto ms are often disp roportionat ely mild when compared with the extensive pneumonia demonstrable by x-ra y. Cough is in itially absent or nonproductive; when present, sputum is mucopurulent and scant. Pleuritic che st pain and splenomegaly occur infr equently; the pulse may be slow in relation to temperature. Encephalitis, myocarditis, and thrombophlebitis are occasiona l complications; relapses m ay occur. Although usua lly mild or moderate in character, human disease can be severe. Lethality : The mortality rate for untreated psitta cosis rang es from 15-20%. However, with appropriate treatment, the mortality rate drops t o less than 1%. Transmissibility : Infection with C. psittaci generally occurs when a person inhales t he organism, which has b een aerosolized from dried feces or r espiratory secretions of infected bird s.

Psittacosis is an illness caused by infection with bacteria known as Chlamydia psittaci . Also known as parrot fever or ornithosis, it is usually transmitted to humans from birds inclu ding par akee ts, parrots, pigeons, turkeys, and ducks. Who gets psittacosis? Since birds sprea d the disease, hum an illness is apt to occur in people who are most likely to be expose d to an infecte d bird such as pet store workers, pigeo n bree ders, poultry w orkers, and peo ple who ha ve recently purc hased an infected bird. How is psittacosis spre ad? Psittacosis is usually spread by inh aling bacteria that is in the dust from drie d bird dro ppings of infected birds or by h andling infec ted birds in slaughter hous es. Other po tential sources of exposure include bir d bites, mouth-to-beak contact and hand ling feathers and tissue fr om infected birds. Some birds infecte d with psittaco sis may app ear he althy, but can still sprea d the infection to oth er birds or h umans. Human-to- human sprea d is very rare . What are th e symptoms of psittacosis? The symptoms of psittacosis include fever head ache, chills, mu scle aches, a nd sometimes pneumonia with a relatively non productive cough. How soon a fter infectio n do sy mptoms occur? xposure and beginni ng of sympto ms can ran ge fro m 5 to 19 days but is usually 10 days. Does past i nfection with psittacosis make a person immune? Infection does not provide permane nt immunity form this disease. How is psittacosis diagnosed? Psittacosis is usually diag nosed by clinical symptoms and a histo ry of exposu re to birds. A blood test to check for antibodies to psitta cosis can confirm the diagnosis. How is psittacosis treated? Several com monly availa ble antibiotics are used to treat psittacosis in hum ans. With appropriate treatment, th e vast majori ty of people fully recove r. How can psittacosis be prevented? Exposed bird s should be treated with feed that contains tetracyc line to reduce the risk of in fection. If birds are kept as pets, clean t he cage often so that fe ces does not ac cumulate, dry up, and be come airborn e.

Q fever is a disease caused by the bacteria Coxiella burnetii . C. burnetii can be foun d in animals (especially cattle, sheep, and goats) t hroughout the world. How do pe ople become infected w ith the Q fever bacteria? People usua lly become infected with Q fever b y breathing in airborne particles th at co ntain C. burnetii bact eria. This most often occurs in barn yard settings through th e inhalation of dust contaminated with dried placental m aterial, birth fluids, and e xcreta of infected herd a nimals. In the United States, Q fever outbreaks have resulted mainly from occupational exposure involving veterinarians, meat processing pla nt workers, sh eep and dair y workers, livestock far mers, and researchers at facilit ies h ousing shee p. Other mo des of transmission, such as tick bite s and human-to-human transmission, are very rare. Why are w e concerned about Q fever as a biow eapon? Coxiella bur netii is a highly infectiou s agent that is resistant t o heat and d rying. Huma ns are often very susceptible to the d isease, and very fe w organisms may be required to cause inf ection. This agent could be developed for use in biologica l warfare and is considered a potential t errorist threat. What are the signs and s ymptoms of Q fever? Only about half of all pe ople with Q fever show any symptoms. Acute ca ses of Q fever begin wit h a sudden on set of one or more of the following: high fevers (up to 104\u00b0-105\u00b0 F), severe headache, general discomfort and fatigue, muscle pain, confusion, sor e throat, chills, sweats, d ry cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, and chest pain. Fever usually lasts for 1 to 2 weeks. Weight loss can also o ccur and may continue for some time. The disease can cause abnormal results on liver function t ests and ca n lead to he patitis. Additionally, 30 % to 50% of people with sympto ms may de velop pneumonia. In general, most people will recover to good heal th within several months without any treatment. Only 1%-2% of people with acute Q f ever die from the disease. Though uncommon, peo ple who have had acute Q fever may develop the chronic for m of the disease with in 1 to 20 years after first being infect ed. How quickl y would so meone become sick if the y were exposed to the Q fever bacteria? Most people become sick within 2-3 weeks after being exposed to Q feve r bacteria, b ut this depends on how man y bacteria have entered the person. Th e more germs that infect a person, the less t ime it takes t o get sick .

If the health care provider suspect s Q fever, blo od samples will be col lected and se nt to the laboratory to look for antibodies to Coxiella burn etii . Because the signs and sympto ms of Q fever are similar t o other dise ases, it is ne cessary to p erform laboratory tests to make an accurate diagnosis. Can Q feve r be treated with antibi otics? Yes. Q feve r can be tre ated with antibiotics. Tre atment is most effective when started early in the course of illness. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for a cute Q fever. Is a vaccin e available to prevent Q fever? A human va ccine for Q f ever has been developed and has successf ully protected workers in occupationa l setting s. However, this vaccine is n ot commercially available in the Unit ed States. A vaccine for use in anim als has a lso been developed, but it is not yet avai lable in the United States.

Ricin is a po ison that ca n be made from the wast e left over from processing castor be ans. It can be made into a powder, a mist, a pellet, or it can be dissolved in water or weak acid. It is a stable sub stance, which means it is not affected much by ext reme conditions such a s very hot or very cold temperatures. Where is ricin found and ho w is it used? Ricin is part of the waste \"mash\" produced when castor oil is made. Since castor bean s are processed t hroughout the world, ricin can be fo und globally . Though co nsidered a p oison, ricin can be used for such medical proced ures as bon e marrow transplants a nd cancer tr eatments. How can pe ople be exposed ricin? Accidental e xposure to ricin is extre mely unlikely, therefore it would take a deliberate act to make ricin a nd use it to poison peop le. There thr ee routes of exposure for ricin: inha lation, ingestion, or injection . People can b e poisoned by breathing in ricin mist or powder, swallowing food or water contaminated with ricin, or having a ricin pellet o r ricin dissolved in a liquid injected into their bo dies. Ricin p oisoning is n ot contagiou s. It cannot be spread fr om person to person through casual contact. How does r icin affect the bod y? Ricin affect s the body by getting inside the cell s and preventing them from making the proteins they need. Without the proteins, ce lls die. Eventually this is harmful to the whole body, and death may o ccur. Effects of ricin po isoning depen d on whether ricin was in haled, ingested, or injected. What are the signs and s ymptoms of ricin exposure? The sympto ms of ricin p oisoning de pend on the route of exposure and th e dose received. Man y organs may be affected in severe cases. Death from ricin poisonin g could take place within 36 to 72 ho urs of exposure, depending on the route of exposure (inhalation, ingest ion, or inje ction) and the dose receiv ed. If death has not occurred in 3 to 5 days, the victim usually recovers. Inhalation : Initial symptoms of ricin p oisoning by inhalation may occur within 8 hours of exposure. The likely symptoms wo uld be respir atory distress (difficu lty breathing), fe ver, cough, nausea, and tightness in the chest. Heavy swea ting may follow as well as fluid bu ilding up in the lungs (pulmonary edema). This wou ld make breathing even more difficult, and the skin might turn blue. Excess fluid in the lungs would be diagnosed by x-ray or b y listening to th e chest with a stethosco pe. Finally, low blood pressure and r espiratory failure may occur, leading to death. Update d August 2004 Page 5. 40 Arizona Department o f Health Services Division of Public Health S ervices Office o f Public Health Emerg ency Prepare dness and Response Frequently Asked Q uestions About Ricin (conti nued from previ ous page) Update d August 2004 Page 5. 41 Arizona Department o f Health Services Ingestion : Following ing estion of ricin, initial symptoms typically occur in less than 6 hours. If so meone swallows a significant amount of ricin, he or she would develop vomiting and diarrhea tha t may beco me bloody. Severe deh ydration ma y be the result, followed by low blood pressure. Other signs or sympto ms may include hallucinat ions, seizures, and blood in the urine. Within several days, the person's liver, spleen, an d kidneys might stop working, and th e person could die. Skin and eye exposure : Ricin in the powder or mist form could cause red ness and pa in of the skin a nd the eyes. Note : Showing these signs and symptoms doe s not necessarily mean that a perso n has been exposed to ricin. How is rici n poisoning treated? There is no antidote for ricin therefor e, it is e specially important to prevent poisoning b y avoiding exposure to ricin. If expo sure cannot be avoided, the most important actio n is to get th e ricin off or out of the body as quickly as possible. This may involve fl ushing the stomach with activated charcoal if the ricin was very recentl y ingested or washing o ut the eyes with water if the eyes are irritated. Ricin poison ing is treate d by giving victims s uppo rtive medical. The specif ic treatment depends on how victims were poisoned (inhalation, ingest ion, or skin or eye expo sure). Care could include su ch measures as helping victims breathe, giving them intraveno us fluids, or giving them medic ations to tre at condition s such a s seizures and low blood pressure. Is there a wa y to test for ricin? There is no widely available, reliable test to con firm that a person has b een exposed to ricin. What should people do if the y are exposed to ricin? It is importa nt to get fresh air by leaving the area where the ricin was rele ased. If the r icin release was outside, this means moving away from the area where the ricin was rele ased. If the ricin relea se was indoor s, people sh ould get out of the building. Moving t o an area with fresh air is a good w ay to reduce the possib ility of death from exposure to ricin. If you think you ma y have been exp osed to ricin , you should remove your clothing, ra pidly wash your entire body with soap and water, and get medi cal care as quickly as possible. If someone has ingeste d ricin, do n ot induce vomiting or give fluids to dr ink. Seek medical attent ion right away.

Salmonella enteritidis has more than 2000 different ser otypes and is responsible for many of t he foodborne gastrointe stinal illnesses commonly found in man and animals. Salm onella typhi cause s typhoid fever. Routes of Exposure: Oral - consumption of cont aminated food or water Infective Dose & Infectivity : The i nfective dose is unknow n but the LD 50 has been reported to b e 10 million organisms. The infectivity of Salmonella is moderate. A carrier state occur s and is more common a mong female and elderly patients. It may persist for months to years. Incubation Period: The incubation can be from 6 to 72 hour s, but it usu ally ranges f rom 12 to 36 hours. Clinical Effects: Salmonella gastro enteritis typically manife sts as nau sea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea, which is sometimes blood y. Weakness, chills, and fever ma y also be present, alth ough there i s a wide variability in the severity of sympto ms seen. The typhoidal syndrome in cludes a h igh spiking fever, abdomi nal cramps, d iarrhea, abd ominal diste ntion, septicemia, enlarged spleen, and occasional me ningeal sig ns. Lethality : The mortality rate of salmonellosis is low to moderate (<1% for most serotypes). Transmissibility : The f ecal-oral rou te is the most common mode of person-to-person transmissio n. There is no known transmission by the inhalational or de rmal routes. Primary Contamination & Method s of Dissemination: In a terrorist attack, sa lmonellosis would most likely occur d ue to intentional contamination of food or water supplie s. Secondary Contamination & Persi stence of Organism: Secondary transmission can result from exposu re to the sto ol of patient s with overt di sease and from chronic carriers. Diarrheal flu ids are highly infective. Greater than 50 % of patient s stop excre ting nontyphoidal Salm onella within five weeks after infection and 90% are culture ne gative within nine weeks. Decontamination & Isolation: Patients - No decontamination nece ssary. Patients can be tr eated with standard precautions, with contact precautions for diapere d or incontin ent patients.

Laboratory testing: The stool, bloo d, and ingested food can be cultured. The best clinica l predictor of a positive st ool culture f or Salmonella is the com bination of d iarrhea persisting for more than 24 hou rs, fever, and either bloo d in the stoo l or abdominal pain with nausea or vomiting. Therapeutic Treatment: For unco mplicated cases, rehydration may b e all that is r equired. Oral or intravenous routes for r ehydration can be used depending o n the individ ual patient's circumstances. Antibiotics are not or dinarily us ed since they prolong fecal shedding, but they should be considered in infants, the elderly, and t hose with u nderlying illn esses. Al l bacteremic patients sho uld receive antibiotics. Strains from developing countries ar e often resi stant to many antibiotics, but are usua lly susceptible t o fluoroquin olones (su as cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). More narro w antibiotics (such as a mpicillin, am oxicillin, and trimethprim-sulfamethoxazole) are alternatives choices when the strain is known to be suscept ible. Proph ylactic Treatment: A typhoid vaccine exists. It is recommended f or travelers to areas where there is a risk of e xposure to Salmonella typhi , people living in typhoid-endemic areas outside the United state s, persons who have continued ho usehold con tact with a d ocumented typhoid feve r carrier, an d laboratory workers with frequent co ntact with S. typhi .

Salmonellosis is an infection with bacteria called Salm onella Most persons infected with Salm onella develop diarrh ea, fever, and abd ominal cramps 12 to 72 hours afte r infection. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 d ays, and most persons recover without treat ment. However, in some persons the diarrh ea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospita lized. In severe cases, Salmonel la infection may spread f rom the intestines to the blood stream and other body sites, causing life-threateni ng illnesses. T he elderly, infants, and those with impaired immune systems are more likely to have a severe illness. What sort of germ is Salmonella ? The Salm onella germ is a grou p of bacteria t hat can cause diarrhe a in humans . They ar e microscopic living creatures that are found in the stools of animal and people. The re are many d ifferent kinds of Salmonell a are the most common in the United States. How can Salmonella infections be diagnosed? Many differe nt kinds of illnesses can caus e diarrh ea, fever, or abdominal cra mps. Salm onella can be cultured from stool, blood, or other bod y fluids. Once Salm onella has been identified, further testing ca n determine its specific type, and which antibiotics could be used to treat it. How can Salmonella infections be treated? Salm onella diarrhea usual ly resolves in 5-7 days without antibiotics. Persons with severe diarrhea will requir e rehydration with oral or intra venous fluids . Antibiotics d o not shorten the course of most Salm onella diarrh ea infe ctions, but can contribute to the development of resistant bacte ria. Ho weve r, antibiotics should be considere d for certain patients, including pe ople with weak immune systems, infants, and those with serious unde rlying he alth pr oblems. Unfortunately, Salm onella are becoming more resistant to antibiotics, due to the freque nt use of antibiotics to promote gr owth in food animals. Are there long-term consequence s to a Salmo nella infection? Persons with diarrhe a usually re cove r completely, although it may be seve ral months before their bo wel habits are en tirely normal. Rarely, Salm onella can spread to bo nes, joints, o r the brain. A very small number of p ersons who are infected with Salm onella , will go on to develop pains in their j oints, irritation of the eyes, and painful urinat ion. This is called Reiter 's syndrome. It can last for months or ye ars, and can lead to chronic arthritis. Antibiotic treatm ent does not make a differenc e in wheth er or not the person later devel ops this kind of arthritis. How do people catch Salmonella? Salm onella live in the intestinal tracts of humans, animals, and birds. Salm onella are usu ally transmitted to humans by when the y eat foods cont aminated with animal feces. Contam inated foods usually look and smell normal. Foo ds at higher risk are of animal origin, such as beef, poultry, milk, or eggs. However, all foods may become contaminated, including vegetables. Although man y raw f oods of animal origin are frequ ome contam inated wh en an infected food Update d August 2004 Page 5. 44 Arizona Department o f Health Services Division of Public Health S ervices Office o f Public Health Emerg ency Prepare dness and Response Frequently Asked Ques tions About Salmonellosis (conti nued from previ ous page) Update d August 2004 Page 5. 45 Arizona Department o f Health Services handle r does not wash his hands after using the bathroom. Salm onella may also be found in the feces of some pets, espe cially those with diarrh ea. People can become infected if they do not wash their han ds after contact w ith thes e animals. Reptile s are particularly likely to harbor Salmo nella. People should alwa ys wash their hands immediately after ha ndling a re ptile, even if the re ptile seems healthy. What can a person do to prevent this illness? There is no vaccine to prevent salmonellosis. People should not eat raw or u ndercooke d eggs, poultry, or meat, and they should no t drink raw milk or other unpast eurized dairy pro ducts. The source of Salmon ella- infected food may not always be appa rent. For exampl e, raw eg gs may be used in some foods such a s homemade h ollandaise sa uce, Caesar and other sa lad dressings, tiramisu, homemade ice cream, homemade mayon naise, cookie dough, and frostings. Poultry and meat shoul d be well cooked (not pi nk in the middle). Produce sho uld be thoro ughly washe d before eatin g. Cross-contamination of f oods should be avoi ded. Unc ooked meats should be kept separate from pro duce, cooked foods, and ready- to-eat foods. Hands, cuttin g boar ds, co unters, knives, and other utensils should be washed thor oughl y after handlin g uncook ed foods. Hand shoul d be washed before han dling any food, and in betwee n handling differen t food items. People shoul d wash their hands after c ontact with a nimal feces. Since r eptiles are particularly likely to have Salm onella , ever yone should immediately wa sh their hands after han dling reptiles. Reptiles (including turtles) are not approp riate pets for small children and should no t be in the sa me house as an infant. How common is salmonellosis? Every year, approximatel y 40,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported in the United States. Because many milder cases are not diag nosed or r eported, the actual number o f infections may be much greater. Young children, the elderly, an d the imm unocompromised are the mo st likely to have severe infections. It is estimated th at 600 perso ns die each year with ac ute salmonellosis. What else is being done to prevent salmonellos is? State and local public heal th departme nts stay informed about cases of salmonellosis. Clinical laboratories send isolates of Salmonell a to the State Public Health Laborato ry for more specific testing. If many similar cases of Salmon ella occur at the same time, it ma y mean that a restaurant or other food source has a problem that needs intervention by the public health depa rtmen t. Pasteurization of milk and treating munici pal water supplies redu ce the risk of Salm onella infection. In 1 975, the sale of small turtles w as hal ted in this country to prevent Salm onella infections. Improvements in farm animal hygie ne, in slaughter practices, in food har vesting, and in packing oper ations have helped p revent salmonellosis. Food industry workers are taught fo od safe ty. R estaurant inspections look for food han dling errors that could lead to outbre aks. Future efforts may include meat irradiation red uce Salm onella contamination of raw mea t. What is the government doing abou t salmonello sis? The Centers for Disease Control an d Preventio n (CDC) monito rs the frequency of Salm onella infections in the country a nd assists the local and State Health Departments to investigate outbreaks and devise co ntrol measures. CDC also conducts research to better identify specific types of Salm onella . The Food an d Drug Administratio n (FDA) inspects impor ted foods, milk pasteuriz ation plants, promotes better food prep aration techniques in restaurants and food pr ocessing plants, and regu lates the sa le of turtles. The FDA also regulates the use of specific antibiotics to promote growth in foo d animals.

Shigellosis is caused when virulent Shigella organisms attach to and penetrate epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa. After invasion, t hey multiply intracellularly, and spread to contiguous epithelial cells resulting in tissue destruction. Some strains produce enterotoxin and Shiga toxin. Routes of Exposure: Fecal-oral transmission through direct and indirect person-to-per son contact is the main route of exposure. Inges ting contaminated foods and beverages can also spread infection. Infective Dose & Infectivity: Shigella bacteria are highly infectious. T he ingestion of very few organisms (10-100) is sufficient to cause infection. Though al l people are believed to be susceptible to some degree, infants, the elderly, and the infirm are most like ly to experience severe symptoms of disease. Incubation Period: The incubation is usually bet ween 1 and 3 days, but can range from 12 to 96 hours for most strains. Some strains have in cubation periods of up to one week. Clinical Effects: The illness is characterized by diarrhea accompanied by fever, nausea, toxemia, vomiting, cramps, and tenesmus. Though cases may also present with watery diarrhea, typical stools contain blood, mucus, or pus, which is the result of mucosal ulcerations and confluent colonic crypt microabscesses caused by ve organisms. Bacteremia is uncommon. Mild and asymptomatic infections can occur. Illness is us ually self-limited, lasting an average of 4-7 days. Severe complications can include toxic megacolon, the hemol ytic uremic syndrome, and Reiter syndrome. Convulsions, which could be the result of rapid temperat ure elevation or metabolic alterations, may occur in young children. Lethality: Although the mortality rate for some strains of Shigella may be as high as 10-20%, it is generally quite low. Two-thirds of the cases, and mo st of the deaths are in children under 10 years old. Transmissibility: Shigella infection is caused by fecal-oral transm ission. Individuals primarily responsible for transmission are those who do not practice pr oper hand washing techniques, especially after defecating. Infection may be spread to others direct ly through physical contact or indirectly through contaminated food and beverages. Unsanitary food handling is the most common cause of contamination. Flies can also transfer organisms from latrines to uncovered food items. Primary Contamination & Methods of Dissemination: In a terrorist attack, Shigella would most likely be disseminated through the intentional contamination of food or water supplies. Secondary Contamination & Persistence of organism: Secondary transmission can result from exposure to the stool of infected individuals. Dia rrheal fluids are highly infectious. In households, secondary attack rates can be as high as 40%. Following illness, stool typically re mains infectious for 4 weeks, though the bacteria can persist for months or longer in asympt omatic carriers. Antimicrobial treatment can reduce the period of infectivity to a few days.

Equipment & other objects - 0.5% hypochlorite solution ( one p art household bleach and n ine parts water), EPA approved disinfectants, and/or soap and water can be used for environment al decontamina tion. Laborator y Testing: Diagnosis is made by isolation of Shigella from feces or rectal swabs. Prompt laborato ry processing of spec imens and use of appr opriate m edia increase the likelihood o f Shigella isolation. In fection is u sually associated with t he presence of copious numb ers of fecal leukocytes detected by microscopic examinatio n of stool mu cus stained with methylene blue or gra m stain. . Therapeutic Treatment: Fluid and ele ctrolyte repla cement is import ant whe n diarrhe a is watery o r there are signs of dehydration. Antibac terial therapy shortens the durat ion and severity of illness and the duration of Shigella excre tion. Multidrug resistance is co mmon; the choice of empiric antibiotics is best determined by local susceptibility patterns. Usually effective ant ibiotics include fluoro quinolo nes, th ird gen and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Antimotility agents such as loperamide are not approved f or children unde r 2 yea rs old. Their use is generally discoura ged in bacter ial infections as these drugs may prolo ng the illness. Nevertheless, if they are a dministered in an attempt to alleviate the sever e cramps that often accompany shigellosis, they should n ever b e given without concomitant antimicrobial th erapy. Proph ylactic Treatment: Prophylactic bacterial food poisoni ng may sho w similar signs and symptoms. Refer ences: Chin J.

Shigellosis is an infect ious disea se caused by a group of bacteria called Shigella . Most people w ho are infected with Shigella develop diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps starting a day or two after they are exp osed to the bacterium. The diarrhea is o ften bloo dy. Shigellosis usua lly resolves in 5 to 7 days. In some persons, especially young child ren and the elderly, the diarrhea can be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. A severe infection w ith high fever may also be associate d with seizure s in children less than 2 years old. Some persons who are in fected may have no symptoms at all, but may still pass t he Shigella bacteria to o thers. What sort of germ is Shigella ? The Shigella germ is act ually a family of bacteria t hat can ca use diarrhea in humans. They are microscopic living creatu res that pass from person to person. There are several different kinds of Shigella bacteria: for o ver two-third s of the shigellosis in the Unit ed States. A second all of the rest. Other types of Shigella are rare in this country, though they continue to b e important causes of dise ase in the d eveloping world. One type found in t he developing world, Shigella dysenteriae type 1, causes deadly epidemics there. How can Shigella infections be diagnosed? Many differe nt kinds of d iseases can cause diarrh ea and bloo dy diarrhea, and the trea tment depends on which germ is causing th e diarrhea. Determining that Shigella is the cau se of the illn ess depends on laboratory tests that iden tify Shigella in the stools of an infect ed person. These tests are sometimes not perfo rmed unless the laborato ry is instruct ed specif ically to look for the organism. The laborator y can also d o special tests to tell which type of Shigella the p erson has a nd which antibiotics, if any, would be best to treat it. How can Shigella infections be treated? Shigellosi s can usually b e treated with antibioti cs. Appropriate treatment kills the Shige lla bacteria that might be present in the patient's stools, and shortens the illness. Unfortunately, some Shigella bacteria have become resistant to an tibiotics. Using antibiot ics to treat shigellosis may contribute t o make the germs more resistant i n the future. Persons with mild infecti ons will usually r ecover quickly with out antibiotic treatment. Therefore, when many persons in a community are affected by shigello sis, antibiotics a re sometime s used to tre at only the more severe cases. Antidiarrheal agents such as loperamide (Imodium) or dipheno xylate with a tropine (Lo motil) are likely to make the illness worse and sh ould be avoided. Update d August 2004 Page 5. 49 Arizona Department o f Health Services Division of Public Health S ervices Office o f Public Health Emerg ency Prepare dness and Response Frequently Asked Ques tions About Shigellosis (conti nued from previ ous page) Update d August 2004 Page 5. 50 Arizona Department o f Health Services Are there lo ng term consequences to a Shigella infection? Persons with diarrhea u sually recover completely, although it may be se veral month s before their bowel habits are entirely normal. About 3% of persons who ar e infected with one type of Shigella, Shigella flexneri , will late r develop pains in the ir joints, irrita tion of the eyes, and pain ful urination. This is called Reiter's syndrome. It can last for m onths or years, and can lead to chron ic arthritis which is diff icult to treat. Reiter's syndrome is caused by a reaction to Shigella infectio n that happens only in people who are genetically predisposed to it. Once someone has had shigello sis, they are not likely to get infected with that specif ic type again for at least several years . However, they can still get infected with other types of Shige lla. How do pe ople catch Shigella ? The Shigella bacteria pa ss from one infected per son to anoth er. Shigella are present in the diarrheal sto ols of infe cted persons while they are sick an d for a week or two afterwards. Most Shigella infections are th e result of th e bacterium passing fro m stools or soiled fing ers of one person to th e mouth of another person. This hap pens when basic hygien e and handwashing ha bits are inadequ ate. It is part icularly likely to occur among toddlers who are not fully toilet -trained. Family me mbers and pla ymates of such children are at high risk of be coming infecte d. Shigella infections may be acquired from eating contaminated food. Contaminated food may look and smell n ormal. Food may become contaminated by infected food han dlers do not wash their hands after using the ba throom. Veg etables can become contaminated if they are harvested from a field with se wage in it. F lies can breed in infecte d feces and then contaminate food. Shigella infection s can also be acquired by drinking or swimming in contaminated water. Water may beco me contaminated if sewage runs into it, or if someone with shigellosis swims in it. What can a person do to prevent this illness? There is no vaccine to p revent shigellosis. However, the spread of Shigella from an infected perso n to other persons can be stopped by frequent and careful ha ndwashing with soap. F requent and careful hand washing is important among all age groups. Fr equent, sup ervised handwashing of all children sho uld be follow ed in day care centers a nd in homes with childre n who are not completely toilet-trained (including children in diapers). Whe n possible , young childre n with a Shigella infectio n who are still in diapers should not be in contact w ith uninfecte d children. If a child in diapers has shigello sis, everyone who changes the child' s diapers should be sure th e diapers are disposed of properly in a closed-lid g arbage can, and should wash his or her hands carefully with soap and warm water immediately after changing the diape rs. After use , the diaper changing ar ea should b e wiped down with a disinfectant such as househ old bleach, Lysol or bactericida l wipes.

Routes of Exposure: Humans are primarily exp osed to SEB by consuming contaminated food. Infective Dose & Infectivity : Minute concentrat ions are able to cause incapacitat ion. All people are considered susceptible. Incubation Period: The incubation period rang es from 4-10 hours afte r ingestion a nd 3-12 hours after inhalation. Clinical Effects: Symptoms of SEB intoxication are abrupt and include nonspecific flu-like sympto ms (fever, chills, headache, myalgias), and specif ic features dep endent on th e route of exposure. Gastrointest inal exposure results in severe nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and prostration o ften accompanied by diarrhea. I nhalation exposures produce respiratory sympto ms including n onproductive cough, retro sternal che st pain, and d yspnea. Ga strointestina l symptoms may accompany respiratory exposure due to ina dvertent swallowing of t he toxin after normal mucocilliary clearance. The fever may last up to five days and range from 103 to 106 degrees F , with variable degrees of chills and pr ostration. T he cough may persist u p to four weeks. Physical examination in patients with SEB intoxi cation is often unremarkable. Conjunctival injection may be pres ent, and postural hypotension may develop due to fluid lo sses. Chest examination is unremarkable except in the unusual case where pulmonary e dema devel ops. The ch est X -ray is also generally normal, but in severe case s increase d interstitia l markings, ate lectasis, and possibly overt pulmonary e dema or an ARDS picture may de velop. Intoxication is u sually self-limitin g though, presumably, severe exp osure could lead to septic shock and death. Lethality : SEB intoxication is rarely f atal, though at higher exposures dea th is possible. Transmissibility : SEB is usually tra nsmitted by ingesting a contaminated food product. When contaminated foods remain at room temperature for several hours before being eaten, toxin- producing st aphylococci multiply and elaborate the heat stable toxin. SEB could also be transmitted through inha lation during an aerosolized release. Primary contaminations & Metho ds of Dissemination: In a terrorist attack, SEB intoxication would most like occur due to an aero solized re lease. In addition, intentio nal contamination of foo d or water supplies could be a possibility.

SEB is relatively stable and resistant to temperature fluctuations. Decontamination & Isolation: Patients - Standard precautions should be practiced. Specific iso lation procedures are not indicated. Equip ment, clothing & ot her objects - 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solutio n (one part household bleach and 9 parts water = 0.5% solution) is effe ctive for environmental decontamination. Laboratory testing: Laboratory findings are not very helpful in the diagnosis of SEB intoxication. A nonspecifi c neutrophilic leukocytosis and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be see n, but these ab normalities are present in many illnesses. Toxin is difficu lt to detect in the serum by th e time sympto ms occur; h owever, toxi n accumulat es in the urine and can be detected for several hours post exposure. Therefore, urine sample s should be obt ained and tested for SEB. Because most patients will develo p a signif icant antibody response to t he toxin, acute and con valescent serum should be drawn which may b e helpful retr ospectively in the diagno sis. Therapeutic Treatment: Treatment is limited to supportive care. Artificial ventilation might be needed for SEB inhalation. Attention to fluid management is important. Proph ylactic Treatment: There is no vaccine available to pr event SEB i ntoxication. Differential Diagnosis: The differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal SEB includes ot her recognized forms of food poisoning. The differe ntial diagno sis of a rap id onset of re spiratory distress would include ricin, mycotoxins, chemical p oisons, Hant avirus pulmonary syndrome, and routine bacterial and viral respiratory infections.

The to xin common ly causes un intentional o utbreaks of f ood poisoning. How is SEB spread? SEB thrives in unrefriger ated meats, dairy, and bakery products. Therefore, SEB is generally transmitted by eating contaminated foods. If SEB were used as a biological weapon, it could be aerosolized and thus inhaled. It is not possible t o spread SEB from person-to-person. What are the s ymptom s of SEB ex posure? Symptoms d iffer depending on the type of exposure. After eating conta minated foods, symptoms with usually start within 4-10 hours and include nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and diarrhe a. Symptoms o f inhaled SEB include a sudden high fever (103\u00ba F. to 106\u00ba F. ), chills, headache, muscle aches, and a dr y cough and will usually appear within 3-12 hours after breat hing in SEB. How is SEB exposure diagnosed? SEB initially diagnosed based on sympto ms. Labor atory confirmations can be made by testing blood and ur ine samples. How is the i llness treated? Usually treatment of foodborne disea se is not ne eded, other than taking steps to pre vent or treat dehydration. For respiratory distress from inhaled SEB, venti lation may be required. What can be done to prevent SEB food poisoning ? By properly preparing meat products and using a ppropr iate r efrigeration t echniques t o store meat and dairy products you can greatly reduce your risk of SEB food poisoning. It is also important to wash your hands before preparing or serving foods and after handling ra w meat. Why are w e concerned about SEB as a biolog ical weapo n? We know that in the past SEB has been studied as a biological weapon and even stockpiled by the United States during it s old biological weapons program, whi ch ended in 1969. SEB is considered an effective biologica l weapon beca use it can b e easily aer osolized a nd is very stable. Though death is possible after exposure to large amounts of the toxin, fatalities are rare. Since SEB is much more l ikely to cause illness that death, it is classified as an \"incapacitating agent .\" Is a vaccin e available for SEB? No vaccine or antitoxin is available to treat SEB before or after exposure.

Trichothece ne mycotoxi ns, biologica l toxins, are a group of 4 0 compounds produced by a common gra in mold. Biological toxins are harmful substance s that are produced by living organisms such as fungi. Why are w e concerned about trichothecene my cotoxins a s a biologic al weapon? We are con cerned abou t trichothece ne mycotoxi ns, especially T-2, as a biologica l weapon because the y are very stable, resista nt to disinfe ctants, easy to produce in large quan tities, and can be disp ersed throu gh a number of different ways. Additionally, ther e is strong e vidence to suggest that they have b een used as biologica l warfare agents in the past . How are tri chothecene m ycotoxin s transmitted? Trichothece in rbed through the skin. The T-2 mycoto xins are the only potential bio logical age nt that can ad here to and penetrate int act skin . Trichothece ne mycotoxi ns cannot b e transmitted person to person. Can trichothecene m ycotoxin exposure occur naturall y? Yes. This usually occurs when contaminated foods, such a s moldy grain, are eaten. What are the s ymptom s of trichothecene m ycotoxin exposure? After exposure early symptoms beg in within 5 to 60 minutes. Symptoms are dependant on the route of exposure. Inhalational exposure results in nasa l itching, pain, sneezing, bloody and runny nose, difficulty breathing, wheezing, co ugh, and blo od-tinged sa liva and spu tum. Exposure through ingest ion cause s loss of appet ite, nausea and vomiting, stomach cramping, and watery and/ or bloody diarrhea. Skin symptoms include burning, ten der and reddened skin, swelling, an d blistering progressing to death of skin tissue s and, in lethal cases, sloug hing of large areas of skin. After exposure to the eyes, pain, tearing, redn ess, and blu rred vision occur. Exposure through any route can lea d to full bod y illness, the sympto ms of which incl ude weakness, f atigue, dizziness, la ck of muscular coordination, irregular he artbeat, hyperthermia or hypothermia , extensive bleeding, an d low blood pressure. How is exp osure to trichothecene m ycotoxin s diagnosed? A diagnosis is generally made based on the symptoms the patient is exp eriencing an d the results from blood and urine test s. Environmental tests may also be done to help support th e diagnosis. Additionally, if the exposure were the result of a b ioterrorism event, man y patients may report seeing a \"yellow rain\" or a smoke attack.

All people ar e considered susceptible, though old er adults may be more sever ely affected. Incubation Period: The incubation p eriod ra nges from 1 to 2 weeks, but is usually 12 d ays. Clinical Effects: Illness usually starts suddenl y with headache, chills, prostr ation, fever, and generali zed body ach es. A macular e ruption ap pears in four to seven da ys, initially on the upper trunk, followed by spread to the entire body, but usually n ot to the fa ce, palms, or soles. The rash starts as maculopapul ar, becomes petechial or he morrha gic, then develops into brownis h-pigme nted areas. The rash may be more concentrated in the axillae. Changes in mental status are common with deliri um or coma. Toxemia is usually pro nounced. Myocardial and renal failure can occur when the di sease is sever e. When untreated, the fever an d illness last for 2 weeks. Lethalit y: The death rat e for untreat ed epidemic typhus incr eases with age and va ries from 10% to 40%. Transmissibility : Typh us fever is transmitted fro m person to person b y the body lo use, which feeds on the blood of humans. Infected lice ex crete rickettsiae in their feces and usually defecate at the time of feeding. People are infe cted when they rub feces or crus h lice in the bite, superfici al abr asions, or mucous membranes. Inhalation of infective louse feces in d ust may account for some infections.

Typhus feve r is a potentia lly fatal, infe ctious disease caus ed by the bacterium Rickettsia pr owazekii . Also known as epidemic typhus, this disease is transmitt ed to humans by b ody lice. Th ough it has occurred on all continents througho ut the world e xcept Australia, typhus feve r is not common in the United States. Who gets t yphus fever? Anyon e can get typhus fever, thoug h it is most lik ely to occur among peo ple living in over crowded, dirt y conditions, with few oppor tunities to wash themselves or their clothing. As a result typhus fever often occurs when cold weathe r, poverty, w ar, and other disa sters result in close living conditio ns where bo dy lice can thrive and sprea d. How is typhus fever tra nsmitted? Typhus feve r is transmitte d by bod y lice, which become cont agious by feedi ng on the blo od of d humans. The lice then defecate will f eeding on another person and the fece s, which contains the typhus fever bacteri a, can get rubbed into small wounds su ch as those caused by scratching lice -infected areas. It is the feces, not the bite of the louse that tr ansmits the illness to humans. It is also possible to become infected through contact with the mucous membranes of the m outh and eyes or by inhalin g the dust of dried lice fece s. Typhus feve r is not spread directly from person-to -person. Could terrorists use t yphus fever? Typhus feve r is considered dang erous and could be used as a biologica l wea pon. Howe ver, because it would be difficult to delive r and easy to treat it is not considered a ver y likely agent. What are th e symptoms of ty phus fever? Symptoms of typhus fever will us ually appear withi n one to two weeks after exposure. Common symptoms in clude fever, head ache, weakness, and mu scle aches. Typhus fever also causes a rash composed of both spots a nd bumps. T he rash starts on the back, ches t, and stomach, th en spreads to the arms and legs. The w orst types of complications involve infe ction in the h eart muscle ( myocarditis) or brain ( encephalitis). Is typhus fever fatal? Most people do not die fro m typhus fever. Patients usually recover with early detection and treatment. Howe ver, if left untreated , the death ra te can be as high as 10 to 40 percent . How is typhus fever diagnosed? Typhus feve r is usually diagnosed thr ough bloo d tests. The org anism can also be identified in tissue samples. Is there treatment for ty phus fever? Effective treatment is possible with antibiotics such as doxycycline, chloramp henicol., or ciprofloxacin.

Routes of Exposure: Humans are primarily exp osed to VEE through the bite of an infected mosquito. Infective Dose & Infectivity : The infective dose is con sidered to be 10 -100 organisms. All people are consider ed suscept ible though children are more likely to be severely affected. Incubation Period: The incubation period is u sually 2-6 days; though it can be as short as 1 da y. Clinical Effects: VEE is characterized by inflammation of the meninges of the brain and of the brain itself , thus account ing for the p redominance of CNS symptoms in the small percentage of infection s that develop encephalitis. The disease is us ually acute, prostra ting and of short duratio n. Illness b egins suddenly with generalized malaise , spiking fevers, rigors, severe headache, photophobia , and myalgias. Nausea , vomiting, cough, sore t hroat, and diarrhea may follow. Full recov ery takes 1-2 week s. Lethality : The overall mortality rate for VEE is less than 1%, but is somewhat higher among children and older adults. Transmissibility : VEE infection gen erally occur s when a person is bit ten by an infected mosquito. VEE is highly infectious when aerosolized. Ther e is no evidence of hum an-to-human transmission, even though VEE virus can be found in human throat swabs. Primary contaminations & Metho ds of Dissemination: As a bioterrorism weapon, VEE would most likely be delivered via aerosolization. Secondary Contamination & Persi stence of organism: Secondary transmission d oes not occur and VEE particles are not considered to be stable in the environment. Decontamination & Isolation: Patients - Standard precautions should be practiced. Specific iso lation procedures are not indicated. Equip ment, clothing & ot her objects - 0.5% hypochlorite so lution (one pa rt household bleach and 9 parts water = 0.5% solution), other EPA appro ved disinfect ants, and heat are effective for environmental decont amination.

Encephalitis (VEE) is a mosqu ito-borne viral diseas e. is common in South Trin idad, Ce ntral America, Mexico, and Flo rida. How do people become in fected wit h VEE virus ? VEE vi rus is transmi tted to huma ns thro ugh the bite of a n infected mosquito. H orses can also become infected with, a nd die fr om, VEE virus infection. There is n o evidence that VEE has been di rectly tran smitted from person-to-person. What c auses VE E? VEE is caused by a virus that is a member of the fami ly Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus . It is closely relat ed to Ea stern and West ern equine encephalitis viruses. Where is VEE foun d? VEE is found in northern Sout h America ( Colombia, Peru, Braz il, Venezuela, French Gu iana, Guyana, and Su riname) and Trinidad. It also cau ses rare cases of human encephalitis in Central Am erica, Mexico, and Florida. Why are we concerned about VE E as a biological weapon ? VEE c ould pos sibly be used as a biologi cal weapon. The virus is stable in the environment and c an survive the storage a nd manip ulation pro cedures necessary for ma king it into a wea pon. Since it may take no mo re that 10-10 0 organisms to cause disea se, it is consid ered to be a pot entially effective bioterrori sm on. Who is at risk for developi ng VEE? Anyone can get V EE, but those a t increased risk of devel oping severe di sease i nclude yo ung children and older adu lts. Pregnant women may also develop compl ications. What are the signs and symptoms of VEE? Most VEE infections are mild w ith only a small percen tage of the infected popu lation developing encephalitis. Persons with the mild f orm of illness may describe on ly minimal flu- like symptoms of low-grade f ever, muscular pa in, or head ache. Patients with moderate disease ma y experien ce fever, chills, muscle pain , back pain , headache, sensitivity to light, vomiting, and sore thr oat. Among severe ca ses sympto ms include a sudde n high fever, severe mus cle and bac k pain, headache, se nsitivity to light, vomi ting, weak ness, exhau stion, and co nfusion. Though rare, seizures, paralysi s, tremors, com a, and seve re ence phaliti s can al so occur. How soon after exposure do sym ptoms appear? Symptoms usual ly appear in 2 to 6 days a fter the bite of an infected mosqui to.

Western Equ ine Encephal itis (WEE) is a mosquito-b orne viral disease that ca n affect the central ner vous system and cause severe complicatio ns and death . How do people become infected with WEE virus ? WEE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infecte d mosquito. The main WEE transmission cycle is between birds an d mosquit oes. Horses can also become infe cted with, and die from, WEE virus infection. What cause s WEE? WEE is caused by a vir us that is a me mber of the family Togaviridae , gen us Alphavirus . It is closely related to Eastern and Venezuelan equine encep halitis viruses. Where is WEE found? WEE is found in North, Central, and South America, but most cases have b een re ported from the plains regions of the western an d central United States. What are th e signs and symptoms of WEE? Infection can cause a range of illnesse s, from no symptoms to fatal disease. People with mild illness often have o nly a head ache an d sometimes fever. People with more severe disea se can have sudden hig h fever, headache, drowsiness, irritability, nausea, and vomiting, follo wed by c onfusion, weakness, and coma. Young infants ofte n suffer seizures. How soon a fter exposure do sy mptoms appear? Symptoms u sually appe ar in 2 to 10 days after the bite of an infected mosquito. How common is WEE? Human cases occur relatively infre quently and can occur in isola ted case s or in epidemics. Human cases in the US are usually first seen in June or July. Who is at risk for devel oping WEE? Anyon e can get WEE, bu t thos e at increased risk include peo ple who en gage in outdoor work and recreational activities and people livin g in or visiting areas whe re the di sease is common. WEE occurs in all age gro ups. How can pe ople avoid infection with WEE virus ? Thoug h a va ccine is available to prote ct horse s, there is no lice nsed vaccine for human use. To avoid infe ction people should avoi d mosquito bi tes by employing pe rsona l and househ old protection measures, such as using insect r epellent containing DEET, wearing pr otective clothing, taking precau tions from dusk to dawn when mosquitoes are most like ly to bite, and contro lling standing wat er that can provide mosquito bre eding sites.

There is n o specif ic treatment f or smal lpox disease, an d the only preventi on is vacci nation. The name smallpox is derived from the Latin word for \"spotted\" a nd refers to the raised bumps t hat appear on t he face and bod y of an infected person. There are t wo clinical forms of sm allpox. Vari ola major is the severe and most common for m of smallpox, with a more extensive rash and higher fever. There are four types of variola maj or smallpox: ordi nary (t he most freq uent type, ac counting for 90% or more of cases) ; modi fied (mil d and occ urring in previo usly vaccina ted persons ); flat; and (both rare and very severe). Hist orical ly, vario la major has an overall fatality rate of abo ut 30%; however, fl at and hemorrh agic smallpox usually are f atal. Variola min or is a less common present ation of smal lpox, and a m uch less severe diseas e, with deat h rates historically of 1% or less. Smallpox outbreaks have occurred fr om time to time for t housands o f years, b ut the di sease is now eradicated after a successful worl dwide vaccination program. T he last case o f smallpox in the United States was in 1 949. The last na turally o ccurring ca se in the world was in S omalia in 1977. After the disease was e liminated from the world, routine vaccin ation against smallpox among the general public was stop ped becaus e it wa s no longer neces sary for pre vention. Where Smallpox Comes Fro m Smallpox is caused by the variola virus that emerged in human pop ulations tho usands o f years ago. Except for laboratory stoc kpiles, the variola virus has been elimi nated. Howev er, in the aftermath o f the events of Se ptember and October 2001, there is heightened concern that the variola vi rus mi ght be used as a n agent of bioterrorism. For this reason, the U .S. governm ent is taking prec autions for dealing with a smallpox outbreak. Transmission Generally, direct and fairly prolon ged face-to -face contac t is requi red to spread s mallpox from one person to a nother. Smallpox also can be s pread through direct conta ct with infected bodi ly fluids or contami nated h as bedding or cl othing. Rarely, smal lpox has been spread by virus carried in the air in enclosed setting s such as buildings, buses, and trains. Humans are t he only natural hosts of variola. Smallpox is not known t o be transmitted by insect s or an imals. A person with smallpox is somet imes contagiou s with onset of fever (prodrome ph ase), but the person beco mes most c ontagious with the onse t of rash. At this stage, the infected person i s usual ly very sick and not able to mo ve around in the comm unity. The infected person is contagiou s until the last smallpox scab f alls off. Page 6.1Smallpox Disease Incubati on P eriod (Duration: 7 t o 17 days) Not contagious Exposure to the virus is followed by an incubation period during which people do not have any symptoms and m ay feel fine. This incubation period averages about 12 to 14 days but can range from 7 to 17 days. During this time, peopl e are not contagious. Initia l Symptoms (Prodrome) (Duration: 2 t o 4 days) Somet imes contagious* The first sym ptoms of smallpox include fever, malaise, h ead and bod y ach es, and sometimes vomiting. The fever is usually high, in the range of 101 to 104 degrees Fahrenh eit. At this tim e, people are u sually too sick to carry o n their no rmal activ ities. This is called th e prodromephase an d may last for 2 to 4 days. Early Rash (Duration: about 4 days) Most contagious Rash distribu tion: A rash emerges first as small red spots on the tongue and in the mouth. These spots develop into sores that break open and spread large amounts of the virus into the mouth and throat. At th is time, the person becomes most c ontagious . Around the time th e sores in th e mouth break down, a rash appears on the skin, starting on the face and s preadi ng to t he arms and legs and then to th e hands and feet . Usually th e rash spreads to all parts of the body w ithin 24 hours. As the rash appears, the fever usually falls and the person may start to feel b etter. By the third day of the rash, the rash becomes raised bumps. By th e fourth day, th e bumps fill with a thick, opaque fluid and often h ave a depression in the cent er that looks like a bellybutton. (This is a major distinguishing characteristic of smallpox.) Feve r often will rise agai n at this time and re main high until scabs form over the bumps. Pustul ar Rash (Duration: about 5 days) Contagious The bumps become pustules \u2014sh arply raised, usually round and firm to the tou ch as if there's a sm all round object unde r the skin. Peop le often say th e bumps feel lik e BB p ellets embedde d in the skin. Pustules and Scabs (Duration: about 5 days) Contagious The pustules begin to form a crust and then scab . By the end of the sec ond week after the rash appears , most of the sores have sca bbed over. Resol ving Scabs (Duration: about 6 days) Contagious The scab s begin to fall off, leav ing marks on the skin that eventually b ecome pitted scars . Most scab s will h ave fallen off thr ee weeks after th e rash appears. The person is co ntagious to others un til all o f the scab s have fallen off. Scabs resolved Not contagious Scabs have fallen off. Person is no longer contagious. Page 6.2 Smallpox Case Definitio ns Introd uction Surveillance for a disease that does not currently exist anywhere in the world presents unique challenges. The goal of pre-outbreak (pre-event) smallpo x surveillance is t o recogn ize the first case of sma llpox, should it ev er occur, without generating excessive numbers of false alarms, unnecessari ly disrupti ng the health care and public health systems , or increasin g public an xiety. In the absence of known smallpox dise ase, the predictive value of a po sitive smallpox diagnostic test is extremely low; therefore, test ing to rule out smallpox should be lim ited to cases t hat fit the clinical case defi nition in order to l ower the ri sk of obtaining a false-positive test result. It is neither feasible nor desirab le, in the pre-even t scenario, to perform laboratory testing for suspected cases that d o not meet the clin ical case def inition. Thus, in the absen ce of smallpox disease in the world, the suggested approach to surveillance relies on a highly specif ic clin ical case def inition, which is focu sed on id entifying the classic case presentation (ordinary type) o f smallpox. Befor e eradicat ion, classic (ordinary type) smallpox generally accou nted for approx imately 90% of smallpox cases in previously unvaccinated individuals and 70 % of cases that occurred in previously vaccinated individuals who were no longer fully protected by vaccination. Becau se the likelihood o f reintroduction of smallpox is ex tremely low, and ackn owledgin g that there are man y other causes of vesicular an d pustular rash illnesses, healthcare prov iders evaluating such cases should also familiariz e themselves with dise ases that can be confused with smallp ox (e.g., s implex, dru g reacti ons of smal lpox di sease. I n this way, in the unlikely event of a smal lpox case, the disease wi ll be clearly and q uickly recogni zed.

Initial confirmatio n of a smallpox outbreak requires additional testing at CDC. Note: Gene ric orthopo x PCR and negative stain electron mi croscopy (EM) ident ification of a pox virus in a clinical specim en are suggestive of an orthopox v irus infection but not diagnostic for smallpox. The importance of case confirmation using labora tory di agnosti c tests differs depending on the epidem iological situation. Becau se of the low predict ive value of a posit ive lab test result in the absence of a kno wn smallpox outbr eak, in the pre-outbreak (pre-eve nt) setting, laboratory t esting should be r eserved for cases tha t meet the cl inical case defi nition and are thus classif ied as being a Page 6.3potential high risk for smallpox acco rding to the rash algorithm poster (www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/diagnosis/evalposter.asp ). Case classification Since smallpox no longer exists as a naturally occu rring disease, a single la boratory confirmed case of smallpox would be considered an outbreak. Once an outbreak of smallpox has been confirmed, the following case classifi cations should be used: Confirmed case: A case of smallpox that is laboratory conf irmed, or a case that meets the clinical case definition that is epidemiologically linked to a laboratory confirmed case. Probable case: A case that meets the clinical case defini tion, or a case that does not meet the clinical case definition but is clinically consistent with smallpox and has an epidemiological link to a confirmed case of smallpox. Examples of clinical presentations of smallpox that would not meet the ordinary type (pre-event) clinical case definition are: a) hemorrhagic type , b) flat type, and c) variola sine eruptione. Suspect case: A case with a febrile rash illness with fever preceding development of rash by 1-4 days.

If vaccines are improperly handled, they can lose their potency and must be replaced. Replacing vaccines can be cost-ly \u2014 a shipment of vaccines can be worth hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. It canalso be costly to the providers' confidence in having properly immunized patients, and the patients' trustof the provider and of vaccines. Every site that ships smallpox vaccines and their diluents should have its own standard operating proce- dures (SOPs), which describe procedures, training, supervision and record keeping to ensure continuousquality assurance year after year. In order to help you develop your procedures, the NationalImmunization Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has prepared the followingguidelines for smallpox vaccine packing and shipping. These guidelines are based in part on CDC'sresearch on different shipping and handling methods under strenuous test conditions. These guidelinesare not intended to be rules and regulations. They are suggestions written primarily for personnel whopack and ship vaccines. If you desire additional information on shipping and shipping materials, contact the National Immunization Program at CDC, at the following address: Attention: Program Support Branch, Immunization Services Division Mailstop E-52, 1600 Clifton RoadAtlanta, Georgia 30333T elephone: (404) 639-8222 12. PROTECTING SMALLPOX VACCINES & DILUENT The individual smallpox vaccine vial, the appropriate amount of reconstituting diluent in a syringe, andthe appropriate number of bifurcated needles foradministering the vaccine are usually combined(\"kitted\") as a single packet (\"kit\"). As needed, oneor more \"kits\" is then packed and shipped to a des-ignated receiver (clinic). Smallpox vaccine should always be protected from heat, and should never be frozen. Diluents should not be frozen. Smallpox vaccine must be kept at appropriate tem- peratures to retain effectiveness.There are twomajor problems in storing and handling vaccineswhich can rapidly reduce their potency: either 1)freezing vaccines that should not be frozen, or2) letting infectious (live) vaccines warm. Smallpox vaccine, like DTaP , Hep A, Hep B, Hib, PCV and IPV, be frozen and should 2\u00b0- 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 - 46\u00b0F) THE \"COLD CHAIN\" Keeping vaccines at the proper temperature at alltimes is called maintaining the cold chain. The cold chain starts at the manufacturer, and continuesuntil the vaccine is used at the clinic or physician'soffice. Remember that it is as important to keepsmallpox vaccine from freezing as it is to keepother vaccines from getting too warm. It's up toyou to see that the \"cold chain\" isn't broken. Cold storage unit monitors should have their temperatures certified annually against reference thermometers. Storage temperatures should bemaintained between 2\u00b0- 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 inany 24-hour period, the temperature in the refrig-erator will often rise or fall a few degrees, it is agood idea to set the temperature at mid-range,about 5\u00b0C (40\u00b0F). Y ou need a continuous tempera-ture monitor that gives a visual record of the tem-perature fluctuations in the refrigerator (Figure 1). An example of a temperature chart is shown on the next page. Y ou will usually need to change thegraph paper weekly. (Digital monitors that recorddata directly into a computer database are alsoavailable.) Y ou should keep the temperaturerecords for three years to prove that your refriger-ator performed correctly over time. 3 Figure 1 A continuous temperature monitor4 This sample chart shows the evenness of temperatures in a cold room during one week. Note the tempera- ture is set at mid-range, about 5\u00b0C (40\u00b0F).Consider a security system for the cold unit which will give a local and a remote warning if there areproblems with the power or temperature (Figure2). There should be a regular, and a back-up, alarmin distribution centers where the smallpox vaccineis stored. Such an alarm system must alert a guard,or call a certain phone number in case of a powerfailure or temperature problem. Be sure everyoneknows how the system works, and how to reachsomeone responsible for the vaccines. It's correctprocedure to have a written emergency plan(\"Disaster Recovery Plan\") posted, so staff knowwhat to do if the power is out in the cold facilityor there is a mechanical failure. All deviations from normal temperatures or proce- dures should be reported in writing to supervisorsand managers, and any responses taken should berecorded, also. Other tips are: Have a back-up generator in case of a power fail- ure (Figure 3). Routine testing (weekly) assures the generator will work if needed. Critical spare parts should be available on demand for rapid repairs. After installing or repairing a refrigerator, allow time (~ 72 hours) for the temperature to stabilizebefore loading vaccines into it. Y our vaccine storage area, or cold facility, should bephysically secure at all times. It's a good idea tokeep the vaccine facility locked. A designated per-son, and a back-up person, should have access tothe facility. A \"Restricted to Authorized Personnel\"sign may be helpful. (See Appendix 1 for Vaccine Do's.) 5 Figure 2 An alarm system that calls you or a guard if there is a temperature malfunction. Figure 3 A back-up generator takes over if the power fails. However, it should be tested and serviced regularly so that it will start when you need it. 3. SHIPPING MATERIALS SHIPPING BOXES Boxes should be sturdy and the right size for ship- ping the amount of vaccines needed. It's a goodidea to have several sizes of insulated boxes onhand (Figure 4). Y ou might code those sizes (e.g.,A,B, C) and note that size on the shipping label. Thatway, if a box is lost in transit, you and the shippingcompany will know which size box you're lookingfor. INSULATION There are a number of ways to insulate your vac-cine shipment. Types of insulation are: Molded polystyrene boxes which may be shipped inside a cardboard box. (See Figure 5.) Isocyanurate panels of foil and plastic with mitered corners inside a cardboard box. These have the advantage of folding flat for storage. (SeeFigure 6.) Polyurethane foam molded between cardboard formers (may be damaged by water. See Figure 7.) Plastic-coated boxes are more durable, but more expensive. The insulating quality (\"R Value\") depends on thematerial and its thickness. Polystyrene boxes withwalls approximately 2 inches thick, or isocyanuratepanels approximately 1 inch thick, may provide asuitable balance between price and performance. 6 Figure 4 Various sized boxes for vaccine shipping. Figure 5 Expanded polystyrene box inside a cardboard box. Figure 6 Isocyanurate panels covered with foil and plastic, having mitered corners.. Figure 7 Polyurethane foam between cardboard formers.FILLERS Fillers are used in empty spaces to prevent shifting of vaccines and cold packs during shipment. Theydo not provide reliable insulation. Fillers include: Brown packing paper. CDC tested 2-ply layers of crumpled brown paper; one ply was a \"30-lb\" face, the second ply was a \"50-lb\" face (Figure 8). Styrofoam pellets or \"peanuts\" or bubble wrap or similar materials (Figure 9). Fillers are also used to separate frozen cold packsfrom the vaccines to prevent freezing. 7 Figure 8 Paper filler which has been crumpled before use. Figure 9 Styrofoam \"peanuts\" are also used as filler.COLD PACKS AND COOL PACKS T o maintain the cold chain when shipping vaccines, a cold source (or sometimes a \"cool\" source) isneeded. Cold (or cool) sources are: Permanently sealed, thin-walled \"gel packs\" or \"blue-ice.\" These can be reused, but may leak slightly if damaged. They are flexible when not frozen. (See Figure 10) Capped plastic bottles filled with a frozen liquid (water or chemical). Those tested by the World Health Organization (WHO) have special sealing plugs and caps that do not leak, except under exceptional conditions.These bottles can be emp-tied and refilled. (See Figure 11) In CDC's tests, the pac performance of gel packsand bottles was similar on a weight to weight basis.Gel packs (or blue-ice) are usually kept in a freezeruntil they are ready to be included in a shipment.For conditions that need frozen cold packs, it's bestthat they are \"warmed\" at room temperature untilthey are at about -5\u00b0C (23\u00b0F). This may take 15 minutes or more, depending on how cold the packs are to begin with, and how theyare placed for warming. Warming will be quicker when the frozen packs are separated from each other with good circulation ofroom temperature air than if they are stackedtogether. For simplicity and consistency, freezingcold packs in a special freezer at -5\u00b0C (23\u00b0F) mightbe helpful in some facilities. The choice of cold pack is best determined by the convenience of fit into the shipping package; forexample, which size is easiest to use.* * In CDC's tests, a single 24 oz. pack covered the top orbottom of a \"small\" box (about 5\"x6\"), and 4 packs complete-ly covered the top or bottom of a \"large\" box (about 12\" square). 8 Figure 10 Permanently sealed, thin-walled \"gel packs.\" Figure 11 WHO-tested, thick-walled plastic bottles with leak-proof caps.TEMPERATURE MONITORS There are a number of monitors that can measure the temperature inside your packages. Y ou mayconsider including at least one heat indicator andone cold indicator in every box, with instructionson how to interpret them. More monitors may beuseful to measure temperatures in different placesinside larger boxes. CDC tested the following monitors: Time/temperature tags which monitor tempera- tures warmer than 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F). After pulling the activation tab, an irreversible blue dye is released in the windows as they are exposed to tempera-tures warmer than 10\u00b0C(50\u00b0F). The more blue windows, the higher the temperature reached inside the box or the longer the time at tempera-tures warmer than 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F) (Figure 12). Color-change monitors, which detect exposure to temperatures colder than 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F), by releasinga red dye marker into a visible bulb. Particularly useful in very cold weather (Figure 13). Analog disposable recording temperature moni- tors which produce linear strip charts over a 4-day period. They may be appropriate for large,expensive shipments (Figure 14). (Electronic, digi-tal recording thermometers are available, also.) (See Appendix 2A for instructions on using monitors, and Appendix 2B for instructions on reading monitors when received in vaccine shipments.) 9 Figure 12 The windows in a time/temperature tag turn blue as the temperature inside the package reaches more than 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F). Figure 13 A color-change monitor releases an irre- versible red dye if the temperature inside the package reaches the freezing point of water. Figure 14 Analog disposable recording temperature monitors which use a battery powered motor to pull a strip chart. The chart is obtained by breaking open therecorder box.INSERTS/INFORMATION A packing slip with the contents and a telephone number to call with vaccine inquiries should beincluded. SEALERS T o assure that the package is tightly sealed and thatthe vaccines don't spill or shift during shipping, sealthe packages well with tape or strapping. Sealers include: Self-adhesive tape which can be used to seal all lids very tightly on polystyrene containers and to seal the top flaps on outer cardboard boxes of all packages. Plastic strapping machines are also used to seal outer boxes. LABELS After the boxes are sealed, it is important to markthe boxes as clearly as possible to designate thecontents - valuable and fragile vaccines. A varietyof stickers are available. (See Appendix 3 for sam- ples of labels.) COMMERCIAL CARRIERS It is important that commercial carriers chargedwith getting your vaccines to the provider fullyunderstand their responsibility.The more clearlyyou can specify your requirements and work withthe contractor(s) of choice, the better the results,and the more likely you and the recipient will besatisfied. (See Appendices 4 and 5 for a list of packing materials you will need and examples of sources.) 104. THE PACKING PROCESS ESTABLISHING A ROUTINE \u2014 THE NEED FOR STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES It is important to establish a routine, systematicprocess for handling smallpox vaccine orders. Manyfacilities find that an \"assembly line-type\" proce-dure works best. It helps avoid confusion, protectsthe cold chain, and helps ensure that the order isfilled properly. We suggest that only one box be packed at a time at each packing station. (See Appendix 6 for a sample procedure. Y ou may want to adapt this sys-tem to fit your needs, or you may want to devise atotally different program.) Each facility should develop its own standard oper- ating procedures (SOPs), covering every aspect ofwork; receiving, storing, and packing and shippingsmallpox vaccines. Y ou may want to test variousmaterials and packing configurations to see whatworks best for your situation. The following \"How-to's\" are examples of packing based on tests byCDC. In order to comply with good manufacturing prac- tices, written SOPs should also exist, and be fol-lowed, for training and monitoring staff performingthe work. Otherwise, there can be no assurancethat procedures will continue to be followed, andproblems identified, reported, and corrected. COOLING REQUIREMENTS FOR SMALLPOX VACCINE SHIPMENTS Smallpox vaccine should never be frozen.Cold packs (i.e., # 0\u00b0C, 32\u00b0F) should be used to keep smallpox vaccine temperature at 2\u00b0- 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0- 46\u00b0F) during shipping to ensure potency. T emperature monitors should normally be used.T o keep vaccines from freezing while also keepingthem from getting too warm during shipping, youcan: 1) vary the temperature of the \"cold\" packs,and/or 2) vary the number of \"cold\" packs used,based on the outside temperature. The quality ofthe insulation will also affect the internal packagetemperatures. When using boxes of similar qualityas those tested by CDC, the following guidelinesare suggested. Example 1 \u2014 \"hot w eather\" In \"hot weather,\" temperatures warmer than 25\u00b0C (75\u00b0F), use enough cold packs to fully cover two ormore faces (e.g., top and bottom or front and back)of the inside of the package. These \"cold\" packsshould be at 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F). This should maintaininternal temperatures for up to 48 hours. Example 2 \u2014 \"temperate w eather\" In \"temperate weather,\" 0\u00b0 - 24\u00b0C (32\u00b0 - 75\u00b0F), either pack vaccines as you would for hot condi-tions, with the \"cool\" packs at -5\u00b0C (23\u00b0F), or useenough cool packs to fully cover four sides of theinside of the package. These \"cool\" packs should be at +5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F) for short-term delivery of less than 24 hours. Example 3 \u2014 \"cold w eather\" In \"cold weather,\" vaccine packages may be exposed to temperatures colder than 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F) outside,but also, to temperatures of 24\u00b0C (75\u00b0F) in a heat-ed indoor area. There is a significant risk that vac-cines will freeze when left in unheated locationsoutdoors. Therefore, use enough cool packs tofully cover all six sides of the inside of the package.These \"cool\" packs may be at +10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F) forshort-term delivery up to 24 hours. Protectionagainst freezing during extended outdoor exposurecan be obtained with \"cool\" packs initially at 15\u00b0-20\u00b0C (59\u00b0- 68\u00b0F). (See Appendix 7 for a climate chart.) 11HOW TO PACK SHIPMENTS OF NON-FROZEN VACCINES Example 1 \u2014 small bo x (Inside dimensions about 6\"x6\"x8\")For a small shipment of smallpox vaccine and diluent: put one 24 oz (600 gm) cold pack on the bottom (See Figure 15) use 4 layers of crumpled 2-ply brown paper or bubble wrap to separate the cold packs from the vaccine kits at the bottom of the package (SeeFigure 16) put the vaccine kits in the center of the vaccine load and close to the cold packs in order to main-tain the desired internal temperature range (See Figure 17) if the vaccine has been reconstituted, ship the vial inside the stability block. Place additional brown paper around the stability block to assure the vaccine does not tip over. Ship the bifurcated needles with the vaccine. place a heat monitor closest to the vaccine (but away from the cold packs) so the receiver can tellif the temperature stayed within the acceptablerange during transit place a freezing temperature indicator near the outside of the vaccines in winter, or near a coldpack (summer and winter) use more brown paper or bubble wrap on top of the vaccines (See Figure 18) put one \"cold\" pack on the top add filler, if needed enclose a packing list seal the box and add labels store in the cold unit when there will be a delay (more than 4 hours), or at room temperature (less than 4 hour delay), until the commercial car-rier picks it up 12 Figure 15 Put one cold pack on the bottom of a small box. Figure 16 Put crumpled brown paper between cold packs and the vaccines. Figure 17 Put the vaccines close to the cold pack. Put a heat monitor on top of the vaccines, but not adjacent to the cold pack.Example 2 \u2014 medium bo x (Inside dimensions about 10\"x10\"x7\") For a medium shipment of smallpox vaccine anddiluent: put one 24 oz (600 gm) cold pack on each of two facing sides (See Figure 19) use 4 layers of crumpled 2-ply brown paper to separate the vaccines from the bottom and all sides of the box (See Figure 20) put the vaccine at the \"cold\" sides or near the top in order to maintain the desired internal tempera-ture range (See Figure 21) place a heat monitor close to the vaccine (but away from the cold packs) so the receiver can tellif the temperature stayed within the acceptable range during transit place a freezing temperature indicator near the outside of the vaccines in winter, or near a cold pack (summer and winter). use more crumpled brown paper (4 layers of 2- ply) or bubble wrap on top of the vaccines put one \"cold\" pack on the top add filler, if needed enclose a packing list seal the box and add labels store in the cold unit or in normal ambient tem- perature until the commercial carrier picks it up Example 3 \u2014 larg e box (Inside dimensions about 12\"x12\"x12\")For a large shipment of smallpox vaccine and diluent: put four 24 oz (600 gm) cold packs on the bot- tom (See Figure 22) use 8 layers of crumpled 2-ply brown paper to separate the cold packs from the vaccine (See Figure 23) 13 Figure 18 Put more brown paper on top of the vac- cines, and put a cold pack on top of the paper. Figure 19 Put two cold packs on the sides of a medium box for \"warm\" weather shipping of non-frozen vaccines. Figure 20 Put crumpled brown paper between the cold packs and the vaccines. Figure 21 Put the vaccines close to the cold packs. Add more brown paper, and an additional cold pack on top.put the vaccines adjacent to the cold packs in order to maintain the desired internal tempera- ture range place a heat monitor close to the vaccines (but away from the cold packs) so the receiver can tellif the temperature stayed within the acceptable range during transit (See Figure 24) place a freezing temperature indicator near the outside of the vaccines (See Figure 25) use more brown paper on top of the vaccines put four \"cold\" packs on the top (See Figure 26) enclose a packing list (See Figure 26) seal the box and add labels store in the cold unit or in an area with normal ambient temperatures until the commercial carri-er picks it up 14 Figure 22 Put 4 cold packs on the bottom of a large box for warm weather shipping of the vaccine. Figure 23 Put crumpled brown paper between the cold packs and the vaccines. Figure 24 Place a heat monitor (outlined in black) close to the vaccines, but away from the cold packs. Figure 26 Add more brown paper, 4 more cold packs on top of the paper, and any inserts you use. Figure 25 Put in next layer of vaccines. Particularly in winter, put a freezing temperature indicator (outlined in black) next to the side of the box, close to the vaccineswhich would be damaged by freezing.PLACEMENT OF TEMPERATURE MONITORS Where monitors are placed within the package isimportant since temperatures vary inside the box.Placing monitors next to the \"cold\" packs does notgive an accurate measure of the temperature of thevaccines that are farther from the \"cold\" packs.Color-change monitors have adhesive backs andmay be attached to vaccine cartons, or walls of thebox to prevent them from moving. A heat monitor (e.g., 3M time-temperature tag), placed at the point of greatest heat exposure (usu-ally near a side, away from cold packs) may have upto, but no more than, four windows blue at thetime of unpacking. A freezing temperature indicator (e.g., ColdMark 32\u00b0F monitor), placed with vaccines near cold packsin summer and, also, near a side but away from\"cold\" packs in winter, should remain clear.(See Appendices 2A and 2B for instructions for how to use and read temperature monitors.) Analog recording monitors are relatively large, and \"best judgement\" must be used regarding wherethey should be placed (e.g., in the center or on theoutside of the vaccines in a large shipment).T emperature Chart Fahrenheit Celsius - 20 - 29- 15 - 26- 10 - 23- 5 - 21 0- 1 85- 1 5 10 - 1215 - 920 - 725 - 430 - 132 034 136 238 340 442 644 APPENDIX 1 SMALLPOX VACCINE DO'S FOR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES Do prevent freezing of Smallpox vaccine and its diluent. Keep them at 2\u00b0- 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0- 46\u00b0F). Do check the refrigerator unit monitor at least twice daily to be sure the temperature stays between 2\u00b0 - 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 - 46\u00b0F). Do change the graph paper in the refrigerator monitors as needed (usually weekly). Also check the ink! Do ensure the cold facility and refrigerator are locked. Do get a security system for the cold facility and train everyone on its use. Do have a written plan in case of an emergency power outage. Do have a back-up generator and test it regularly. Do let the temperature in a new, or newly repaired refrigerator stabilize (~72 hours) before putting vac- cines in it. Do have standard operating procedures covering the use of every item of equipment and all steps for receipt, storage, and distribution in place; train staff in their use; and continually check for compliance. Do have phone numbers of key people available for handling emergencies. 16APPENDIX 2A \u2014 INFORMATION FOR SHIPPERS HOW TO USE TEMPERATURE MONITORS Time/temperature tags must be kept refrigerated until the moment of use. Pull the tab to activatethe monitor. As the temperature inside the pack-age rises to warmer than 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F), the windowsin the monitor turn blue. The more windows thathave turned blue, the higher the temperaturesreached inside the box or the longer the timewarmer than 10\u00b0C. If no windows are blue, thencheck whether the monitor was activated. If all fivewindows are blue, then contact the manufacturer. The ColdMark Freeze Indicators detects exposure to temperatures under 0\u00b0C by releasing a red dyemarker into a visible bulb. These are usually placedadjacent to cold packs in the summer, and also neara wall in the winter. If the bulb is red, smallpox vac-cine may not be usable. Contact the manufacturer. Analog disposable recording temperature monitors are available which produce linear strip charts overa 4 day period. They may be appropriate for large,expensive shipments. They should be kept refriger-ated until used. T o start the temperature monitor:fill out the tag with a ball point pen, press hard; peeloff the top tag; pull up on the start tab and removecompletely. Confirm the unit is ticking. T o removethe chart: cut the tamper evident seal; press endand pry up on cassette; remove chart.

Inventory controls identify which smallpox vaccines will be selected. Smallpox vaccines are pulled from systematically organized smallpox vaccine stocks. Vaccines are set on a work counter and checked carefully against the order need. The appropriate sized box is selected, based on the quantity of vaccine being shipped. Smallpox vaccine packed with enough cold packs to keep the appropriate internal temperatures throughout the shipping process. T emperature monitors are placed in appropriate locations in the package to detect potentially harmful temperature exposures during shipping. All remaining empty space in the box is filled with some kind of filler material. A packing list is enclosed. The box is sealed with tape or plastic straps to insure that it remains tightly closed. A shipping label, coded for the size of the box being shipped, is affixed, so that if the box is misplaced, it will be easier to locate. Labels are applied so that they are clearly visible on the outside of the box, to let everyone know that the contents include vaccines which must be handled properly. Once the box is packed, sealed, and labeled, it is stored until it is picked up by the commercial carrier or designated clinic personnel. Other packages may be similarly stored or placed in a refrigerated area, if space is available, or at ambient temperature, depending on when the carrier picks up packages. 22APPENDIX 7 CHART OF COLD PACK NEEDS FOR DIFFERENT CLIMATES Outside No. faces covered T emperature of Comment* T emperature with cold packs cold/cool packs 110\u00b0F 2\u00a7-5\u00b0C (25\u00b0F) up 75\u00b0F 2\u00a7-5\u00b0C (25\u00b0F) 48 24 hrs 32\u00b0F <32\u00b0F 4 - 6\u00b6+5\u00b0C (50\u00b0F) about 24 hours exposure to mix of outdoors & heated areas 0\u00b0F or colder (-20\u00b0C) quality insulated boxes with walls of 1:\" to 23\" expanded polystyrene, 1\" isocyanurate, or 3\" polyurethane insulation were used. \u00a7 3 for the medium box tested by CDC. \u00b6Essentially the entire surface area is covered with \"cool\" packs 23 Smallpox is a serious disease that can kill up to 3 out of 10 people who get it. Smallpox can also cause\u2014 /H12135a severe rash, which can leave scars when healed. /H12135high fever. /H12135tiredness. /H12135severe headaches and backache. /H12135blindness. Smallpox is caused by a virus called \" variola ,\" which spreads from person to person. Usually, face-to-face contact lasting 3 or more hours is needed to spreadsmallpox from one person to another. Smallpox canalso be spread through direct contact with infectedbody fluids or objects such as bedding or clothing thathave smallpox virus on them. Smallpox killed millions of people over the centuries. Smallpox vaccination was developed in 1796.As aresult, the last outbreak of smallpox in the UnitedStates was in 1949.The world's last case of naturallyoccurring smallpox was in 1977. Routine vaccination ofthe American public against smallpox ended in 1972. Smallpox vaccine is made from a living virus called \"vaccinia .\" Vaccinia virus is like smallpox virus, but less harmful. The smallpox vaccine can NOT give you smallpox. The vaccine is not a shot like other vaccines.The needle is pricked into the skin a number of times in a few seconds (usually in the upper arm).The pricking is notdeep, but will cause one or two small drops of bloodto form.The place on the skin where the vaccine isgiven is called the \"vaccination site.\"Getting the vaccine\u2014 /H12135before exposure will protect most people from smallpox (the vaccine is about 95% effective). /H12135up to 3 days after exposure can prevent the disease or at least make it less severe. /H121354-7 days after exposure can still make the disease less severe and decrease the chance of death. Smallpox vaccine protects people from getting smallpox for 3 to 5 years. Protection from severe illness and death can last 10 years or more. Smallpox vaccine protects people from smallpox. Some people should get the vaccine because they work with smallpox or related viruses in laboratories. Others are being offered the vaccine so they can assist in responding to a smallpox outbreak.Smallpox virus is kept in two approved laboratories in the United States and Russia.There is concern that terrorists may have obtained the smallpox virusand could use it as a weapon. If this happened, many people could become ill and many could die. The U.S. needs teams of health care providers and others to be vaccinated so they can respond quicklyif a smallpox attack happens.These teams will domany things to help control a smallpox outbreak,including quickly vaccinating people who have beenexposed to the disease.

When There ISa Smallpox Outbreak\u2014 Y ou should get the smallpox vaccine if you\u2014 /H12135Are directly exposed to smallpox virus. If there is a smallpox outbreak, public health experts will say who else should get the vaccine. Vaccinated persons may need to get the vaccine again at least every 3-10 years, depending on their risk of exposure to smallpox or related viruses. When There is NOSmallpox Outbreak\u2014 Y ou should NOT get the smallpox vaccine if you\u2014 /H12135/H12135Have Skin Problems People with skin problems are at risk of developing rashes which can be severe if they get the smallpox vaccine. /H17075Anyone who has atopic dermatitis (often called eczema) or had it in the past,should not get the smallpox vaccine. /H17075Anyone who has Darier's disease (a skin disease that usually begins in childhood)should not get the smallpox vaccine. /H17075Anyone who has a skin problem that hasmade many breaks in the skin (such as anallergic rash, bad burn, impetigo, psoriasis,pityriasis rosea, poison oak, poison ivy,chickenpox, shingles, herpes, or very badacne) should not get the vaccine now.Theyshould wait until the skin heals before getting the smallpox vaccine./H12135Have Immune System Problems Rarely, when a person with a weakened immune system gets the smallpox vaccine, their vaccination site does not heal. Instead, it spreads to other parts of the body.This reaction can be life-threatening.Anyone with a weakened immune system should NOT get the smallpox vaccine, including anyone who: /H17075Has HIV/AIDS, primary immune deficiencydisorders, humoral (antibody) immunityprob lems (such as agammaglobulinemia or lack of normal antibodies), or other diseases that affect the immune system . /H17075Has lupus or another severe autoimmune disease that weakens the immune system. /H17075Has leukemia, lymphoma, or most other cancers. /H17075Is taking cancer treatment with radiation ordrugs, or has taken such treatment in the past 3 months. /H17075Is taking, or has recently taken, drugs thataffect the immune system.These include high-dose steroids (for 2 weeks or longerwithin the past month), some drugs forautoimmune disease, or drugs taken for anorgan or bone marrow transplant. /H12135Have Heart Problems Smallpox vaccination may cause heart inflammation that can be mild to life-threatening. It is notknown who is at risk for this problem.As a precaution, anyone who has been told by a doctor that they have a heart condition should NOT get the smallpox vaccine, even if they feel well.This includes anyone who has: /H17075Known heart disease, such as past heart attack or angina (chest pain caused by lack of bloodto the heart). /H17075Congestive heart failure /H17075Cardiomyopathy (heart muscle becomes enlarged and does not work as well as it should) /H17075Stroke or transient ischemic attack (a \"mini-stroke\" that causes stroke-like symptoms, but no lasting damage) /H17075Chest pain or shortness of breath with activity (such as walking up stairs) /H17075Other heart conditions that require the care of a doctor Smallpox VIS \u2014 11/15/03 \u2014 Page 2 of 6 \u2014 Version II5WHO SHOULD NOT GET THE SMALLPOX VACCINE ,OR SHOULD WAIT ?4WHO SHOULD GET SMALLPOX VACCINE AND WHEN ?In addition, anyone with 3 or more of the following risk factors should NOT get the smallpox vaccine: /H17075Have been told by a doctor that you have high blood pressure. /H17075Have been told by a doctor that you havehigh blood cholesterol. /H17075Have been told by a doctor that you have diabetes or high blood sugar. /H17075Have a first degree relative (for example,mother, father, sister or brother) who had aheart condition before the age of 50. /H17075Smoke cigarettes now /H12135Are Pregnant or Breastfeeding Babies of mothers who have been vaccinated while pregnant or during the month before theybecome pregnant can get a very rare but seriousinfection from the vaccine. /H17075Do NNOOTTget the smallpox vaccine if you are pregnant, think there is a chance you are pregnant, or think you might become pregnant within 4 weeks after vaccination. /H17075Sexually active women are encouraged to take a pregnancy test before getting the vaccine.The test should be done the day theirvaccination is scheduled. But be aware that even the best tests may not detect earlypregnancies (those less than 2 weeks). /H17075Take steps to prevent pregnancy during the month before and the month after vaccination: /H12135Do not have sex, or /H12135Use effective birth control every time you have sex. Effective birth control methods include male or female sterilization, hormonal methods (such asbirth control pills, implants, patches orinjections) and intrauterine devices(IUDs). Condoms and the use of spermicide with diaphragms, sponges, orcervical caps are also acceptable methods, although they are less effective.Do NOT rely solely on the rhythm or 'natural family' planning method./H12135DoNOT get the smallpox vaccine if you are breastfeeding. Follow this advice even if you are pumping and then bottle-feedingbreast milk. It is not known if smallpox vaccine virus or antibodies can be passedto babies through breast milk. /H12135Other Reasons\u2014Do NOT Get the Smallpox Vaccine if Y ou\u2014 /H17075Are very allergic to polymyxin B, streptomycin, chlortetracycline, neomycin, or latex. /H17075Had a bad reaction the last time you got the smallpox vaccine. /H17075Are using steroid drops in your eyes. /H17075Are moderately or severely ill the day ofyour vaccination appointment.Wait until you are better before getting the smallpoxvaccine. /H12135Y ou should NOT get the smallpox vaccine if you live with or have close physical contact with anyone (such as a sex partner) who\u2014 /H17075Has any of the skin problems listed above. /H17075Has any of the immune system problems listed above. /H17075Is pregnant or may become pregnant within 4 weeks of your vaccination. The smallpox vaccine may pose a similar risk to them. Smallpox vaccine is not routinely recommended for anyone under 18 years of age or for olderpeople. People age 65 or older who do not have any of the conditions listed above should talk to their health care provider before gettingthe vaccine. If There ISa Smallpox Outbreak\u2014 These restrictions may not apply. Public health experts will say who should get the vaccine at that time.

Day 4 Day 14Day 7\u00bd inch \u00bd inch \u00bd inch \u00bd inch \u00bd inch \u00bd inchNormal Reactions Week 1: Three or 4 days after vaccination, a red, itchy bump will form at the \"vaccinationsite\". Most times, this spot is about the sizeof a dime. It can be larger than 3 inches.The bump becomes a blister. It will fill withpus and then start to drain. A health care provider should check your vaccination site 6-8 days after you get thevaccine to make sure the vaccinationworked and everything is o.k. Week 2: The blister will dry up and a scab will form. Week 3: The scab will fall off. It will leave a small scar. The lymph nodes under your arm may swell and besore.The vaccination site may itch.Y ou may also feeltired, have a mild fever, headache, or muscle aches. Y ou may not get a blister if the vaccine did not workproperly or if you are already immune to smallpox. Inthis case, you will need to get the vaccine again. If youstill do not get a blister after getting the vaccine a second or third time, a health care provider will tell you if you are, or are not, considered immune. What You Will Need to Do The virus in the vaccine is alive. It can be spreadfrom the vaccination site to other parts of your bodyor to other people through close physical contact.This can happen until the scab falls off. In the past, the vaccine virus was spread from vaccinatedpeople to others about 2 to 6 times out of every100,000 people vaccinated for the first time (this usuallyhappened between people who lived together).To Help Prevent Spread of the Virus: /H12135Cover the area loosely with a gauze bandage held in place with first aid tape.While at work, health care workers should also cover the gauzewith a semi-permeable bandage (this type of bandage allows air to flow through but not fluids). /H12135Change the bandage often (at least yyoouurr vvaacccciinnaattiioonn ssiittee.. /H12135Do not let others touch the site or items that have touched it such as bandages, clothes, sheets,or towels. /H12135Always wash your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand wash if you touch the site or if you touch bandages, clothes, sheets, or towelsthat have touched the site. /H12135Keep the vaccination site dry. If the gauze bandage gets wet, change it right away. Cover your vaccination site with a waterproof bandage while bathing. /H12135Don't scratch or put ointment on the vaccination site. /H12135Don't touch your eyes, any part of your body, oranother person after changing the bandage ortouching the vaccination site until you have washedyour hands. /H12135Wear a shirt that covers the vaccination site and bandage.This helps protect those you have closecontact with such as young children or the personyou share a bed with. /H12135Don't share towels. /H12135Do your own laundry. Use a separate laundry hamper for clothes, towels, sheets, and other itemsthat may come into contact with your vaccinationsite or pus from the site. Machine wash items thathave touched the vaccination site in hot waterwith detergent and/or bleach. /H12135Put used bandages in plastic zip bags, then throwthem away in the regular trash. /H12135 After the scab falls off, put it in a plastic zip bagand throw it away. If you do not feel like you can follow these instructions, do notget vaccinated.MILD TO MODERATE PROBLEMS HOW OFTEN DID IT HAPPEN IN THE PAST ?

Smallpox VIS \u2014 11/15/03 \u2014 Page 5 of 6 \u2014 Version II7WHAT ARE THE RISKS FROM THE SMALLPOX VACCINE ? For every million people vaccinated in the past, up to 52 people had a life-threatening reaction to smallpox vaccine and up to 2 people died. The numbers provided above for severe or life-threatening problems are from studies done in the 1960's when the smallpox vaccine was still routinely used in the U.S.The numbers reflect how often the problems occurred in infants,children, and adults. The numbers provided for all other problems are from recent studies and experiences vaccinating members of response teams and the military.Within a Few Minutes to a Few Hours of Getting the Vaccination, Watch For\u2014 /H12135Trouble breathing, hoarseness or wheezing. /H12135Hives, pale skin, weakness, a fast heart beat, or dizziness. These could be signs that you are having an allergic reaction to the vaccine. For the Next 3 to 4 Weeks, Keep Watching For\u2014 /H12135A vaccination site that is not healing. /H12135A rash or sore on other parts of your body. /H12135An eye infection. /H12135A lasting headache or fever. /H12135Confusion, seizures, or trouble staying awake. /H12135Chest pain, shortness of breath, rapid or unusual heartbeat or unusual fatigue. /H12135Any unexpected health problem. What Should You Do? If you or a close contact have any of these problems,or if you are concerned about any health problem thatyou have after vaccination\u2014 /H12135Call or go to a health care provider right away. /H12135T ell the health care provider that you receivedthe smallpox vaccine and when. /H12135Ask your doctor or nurse to file a VaccineAdverse Event Report (VAERS form) and contactthe health department.Y ou can also file a reportyourself by visiting the VAERS website atwww.vaers.org or by calling 1-800-822-7967 . Treating Serious Problems There are two drugs that may help people who havecertain serious side effects from the vaccine:VacciniaImmune Globulin (VIG) and cidofovir.These drugsare not licensed for this purpose, and may also causeside effects.Cost of Treating Serious Problems In the rare event that you have a serious reaction to the smallpox vaccine, a federal program has been created to help pay for related costs of medical careand lost wages.This program was created to compensate certain people, such as health care workers and emergency responders, injured by thevaccine. It will also cover certain people injured as the direct result of exposure to vaccinia through contact with certain people who received the smallpox vaccine (or with the contacts of such vaccine recipients).The program covers related costs of medical care and lost wages (usually startingafter the first five days of missed work) after otheravailable coverage, such as workers' compensation orhealth insurance, has been used. The Department of Health and Human Services will make more information about this program availablesoon, including how to request benefits and/or compensation.

Vaccination C ontraindication: Prev ious Allergic Reaction t o Smallpox Vaccine or A ny of the Vaccine's Components Vaccinia vacci ne (Dry vax\u00ae) contains small chlortetracycline hydroch loride, neomycin phenol. Anyone who has experienced an anaphylactic reactio n to these components should not be vaccinated. In addition, anyo ne who has ex perienced a previous allergic reacti on to t he smal lpox vaccine sho uld not be vaccinated. General precaution: The vaccine via l stopper contains dry natural rubber that may cause hypersensitivity reac tions when handle d by, or when the product is administered to, persons with known or possibl e latex sensitivity. Page 6.47 SMALLPOX FACT SHEET . Information for Clinicians Smallpox (Vaccinia) Va ccine Contraindications Because the vaccinia virus used in s mallpox vac cine can be spread to others from the vaccine site of an immunized person, the co ntraindications below apply to both potenti al vaccinees an d their h ousehold cont acts (.household conta cts. include person s with prol onged intimate contact with the poten tial vaccinee, including the potential for direct contact with th e vaccination site, e.g. , sexual contacts). Eczema or atopic dermatitis and othe r acute, chronic, or exfoliative skin conditions Persons who have ever been di agnosed w ith eczema or atopic dermat itis should not be vaccinated, even i f the condi tion is not c urrentl y active. These patients are at high risk of developing eczema vaccinatum, a potentially severe and somet imes f ication. Additionally , persons with house hold conta cts that have a history of e czema or atopic dermatitis, irrespective of disease severi ty or acti vity, should not be vaccinated. If the poten tial vacci nee or any o f their house hold contac ts have other acute, chronic, or exfoliative skin conditions (e.g., burn s, impet igo, chicken pox , contact dermat itis, shingles, herpes, severe acne, severe di aper dermatitis with extensive areas of denuded s kin, or psoriasis) , they are at risk for inadvertent autoinoculation of the affected sk in with vaccinia virus and should not be v accinated until the con dition(s) resolv es. Persons with Darier.s disease can develop eczema vaccinatum and therefore should not be vaccinated. Diseases or conditions whic h cause immunod eficiency or immunosuppression If a pote ntial vacci nee or any o f their househol d contacts have con ditions such as HIV/AIDS, solid organ or st em cell transplan t, generalized malign ancy, leukemia, lymphoma, or agammaglo bulinemia, they should not be vaccinated. People w ith these con ditions are at greater risk of developing a serious adverse reaction resulting from unchecked replicat ion of the vac cine virus (progr essive vacci nia). It i s also reported that some p atients wi th severe clinical manifestations of some aut oimmu ne diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythe matosus) may have some degree of immuno compromise as a compo nent of the disease. These patients s hould not rec eive small pox vacci ne during the pre-event vaccination program. HIV testing should be readi ly available to all person s considering smallpox vaccination. HIV testing is recommended for persons who have any history of a ri sk factor for HIV i nfection and who ar e not s ure of their HIV infecti on status. Anyone who is concerned tha t they could have HIV inf ection also sh ould be tested. HIV test ing should be av ailable in a con fidential or, where perm itted by ng with res ults communi cated to t he potential vaccine before the planne d date o f vaccination. Persons with a positive test res ult should be told not to present to the vacci nation clinic for immuni zation. Treatments which cause immunode ficiency or immunosuppression If a pote ntial vacci nee or any o f their hous ehold contacts are undergo ing or 20 mg/d ay of prednisone for 2 weeks), chemotherapy agents, or organ transplant medications , they s hould not be vaccinated. People w ho are receiv ing these therapies are at greater risk of serious adverse reactions to the smallpox vaccine . Page 6.48 People undergoing treatment with high dose corticosteroids, or who have household contacts undergoing such treatment, should not be vaccinated within one month of completing corticosteroid therapy. Person s undergoing other treatments which cause immunosuppression or who have household cont acts undergoing such treatment should not receive smallpox vaccine until they or their household contact have been off immunosuppressive treatment for 3 months. Pregnancy Live virus vaccines are genera lly contraindicated during pregnancy. Pregnant women who receive the smallpox vaccine are at risk of fe tal vaccinia. Although this is a very rare condition (fewer than 50 cases have ever been reported), it usually results in stillbirth or death of the infant shortly after delivery. Before vaccination, people should be asked if they or any of their household contacts are pregnant or intend to become pregnant in th e next 4 weeks; those who respond positively should not be vaccinated. In addition, women who are vaccinated should be counseled not to become pregnant during the 4 weeks after va ccination, and abstinence or highly effective contraceptive measures should be recommended to reduce the risk of pregnancy within four weeks of vaccination. Routine pregnancy testing of women of child-bearing age is not recommended. Any woman who thinks she could be pregnant or who wants additional assurance that she is not pregnant should perform a urine pregnancy test using a .first morning. void urine on the day scheduled for vaccination. Ho wever, women should be informed that a negative urine pregnancy test cannot exclude a very earl y pregnancy and therefore they and their healthcare providers should not base a decision about their pregnancy status solely upon a urine pregnancy test result. If a pregnant woman is inadvertently vaccinated or if she becomes pr egnant within 4 weeks after vaccinia vaccination , she should be counseled regarding the basis of concern for the fetus. However, vaccination during pregnancy should not ordinarily be a reason to terminate pregnancy. The contraindications above apply to po tential vaccinees and their household contacts. The following additional cont raindications apply only to potential vaccinees: Previous allergic reaction to smallpox vaccine or any of the vaccine.s components Vaccinia vaccine (Dryvax\u00ae) cont ains small streptomycin sulfate, chlortetracycline hydrochloride, neomycin sulfate, and phenol. Anyone who has experienced an anaphylactic reaction to th ese components should not be vaccinated. In addition, anyone who has ex perienced a previous allergic reaction to the smallpox vaccine should no t be vaccinated. Moderate or severe acute illness Moderate or severe acute illness is generally a contraindication to vaccination. Vaccination should be deferred until the acute illness has resolved. Infants and children Smallpox vaccine is contraindicated for children under 12 months of age. The Advisory Committee on Immu nization Practices (ACIP) advises against non-emergency use of smallpox vaccine in persons younger than 18 years of age. Breastfeeding Breastfeeding mothers should no t receive the smallpox vaccine. The close physical contact that occurs during breastfeedin g increases the chance of inadve rtent inoculation. It is not known whether vaccine virus or antibo dies are excreted in human milk. Heart disease, temporary deferral CDC recommends that persons with known card iac disease such as previous myocardial infarction, angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy not be vaccinated at this time. This recommendation follows reports of cardiac events fo llowing smallpox vaccinations including myocardial infarction s and angina without myocardial infarction. It is unclear whether or not there is any association between smallpox vaccination and these cardiac events. Experts are exploring th ese issues more in depth. Th is exclusion may be removed as more information becomes available. General precautions: The vaccine vial stopper contains dry natural rubber that may cause hypersensitivity reactions when handled by, or when the product is administer ed to, persons with known or possible latex sensitivity. Persons with inflammatory eye di seases may be at increased ri sk for inadvertent inoculation due to touching or rubbing of the eye. Therefore it may be pr udent to defer vaccination of persons with inflammatory ey e diseases requiring steroid treatment until the condition resolves and the course of therapy is complete. Contraindications to Vaccination During a Smallpox Emergency During a smallpox emergency, all contraindicati ons to vaccination woul d be reconsidered in the light of the risk of smal lpox exposure. Persons would be advised by public health authorities on recommend ations for vaccination. Careful screening is essential to minimize complications from the smallpox vaccine. If you have any questions about whether or not someone should receive the smallpox vaccine, visit the CDC website at www.cdc.gov/smallpox. For more information, visit www.cdc.gov/smallpox, or call the CDC public response hotline at (888) 246-2675 (English), (888) 246-2857 (Esp a\u00f1ol), or (866) 874-2646 (TTY) March 28, 2003 SMALLPOX FACT SHEET What to Do After You've Gotten the Smallp ox Vaccine The smallpox vaccine c ontains a live virus called va ccinia. After vaccination , this live vi rus is present at the vaccine site and ca n be spread to other parts of the bod y or to o ther individuals throug h contact. To a void this, the vacci nation site must b e cared for carefully until the scab that forms after vacci nation fal ls off on its own (in 2 to 3 weeks). Follow these instructions: WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: Cover the vaccinat ion site loos ely with a gauze bandage, usin g firs t aid adhesive t ape to keep it in pl ace. Keep i t covered un til the scab falls off on i ts own. This ban dage w ill prov ide a barrier t o protect again st spread of the vaccinia virus. (When involved in direct patient care, healthcare workers should cove r the ga uze with a semiperm eable [semio cclusive] dressing as a n additional barrier. A semipermeable dressi ng is one tha t allows for the passage of air but does not allow for the pas sage of fluids.) Wear a shi rt that cov ers the v accination s ite as an extra precaution to prevent spread of the v accinia viru s. This is part icularly import ant in situations of close phy sical contact. Change the bandage every 1 to 3 days. This will keep skin at the v accination site from softeni ng and wearing away. Wash h ands with so ap and hot water or with alcoh ol-based h and rubs such as gels or foams aft er direct contact w ith the vaccination site, the bandage o r clothes, towels or s heets th at migh t be c ontami nated with vir us from the vaccinat ion site. This is v ital in order t o remov e any virus from your hands and prevent co ntact spread . Keep the v accination site dr y. Cover the vaccination site with a waterproof ba ndage when yo u bathe. Remember to change back to the loose gauze ba ndage after ba thing. Put the co ntamin ated bandages in a s ealed pl astic bag and th row them away in the tr ash. Keep a separate laundry h amper for clothing, towels, bedding or other items that may have come in direct con tact with the vaccine site or d rainage from the si te. Wash clot hing or ot her any materi al that comes in contact with the v accination site, using hot water w ith detergen t and/or bleach. Wash hands afterwar ds. When the scab falls off, throw it away in a sealed plastic bag (remember to wash your hands afterwards) . DO NOT: Don't use a ban dage that block s all air from the v accination sit e. This may cause t he skin at the vaccination site to soften and wear away. Use l oose gauze secured with medical tape to cove r the si te. Don't put salves or o intments o n the v accination sit e. Don't scratch or pick at the scab. Page 6.51 Evaluation of Takes and Non-Takes A \"take\" or \"major reaction\" indicates success ful vaccination and is charac terized by a p ustular lesion or an area of defi nite induration or congest ion surroun ding a central les ion, which can be a scab or an ulcer. All other respons es should b e considered \"n on-takes.\" \"Non-takes\" can be caused b y improper vacci nation techni que, use of vaccine that has lost it s pote ncy, or resid presu med to be immu ne to smallp ox, and revaccin ation is recommen ded. It is recommended tha t \"take\" e valuation for b oth first-time vacci nees and revac cinees be don e on day 6, 7, or 8 following vaccination. Vac cine site evaluations on other days may not be reliab le. If the evaluation is done too earl y (e.g., <6 days postvac cination), cert ain to vaccinial protei ns. T hese reactions are sometimes referred to as immedia te reactions but are not success ful \"takes. \" If \"take\" evaluation is done too late (e.g., >8 da ys po stvacci nation), the vacc ination \"take\" might be missed among previously vaccinated persons who can experience an accelerate d successful ta ke reacti on at the vaccination site if they still have partial immu nity to vaccinia. The two images below both clearly demon strate a cen tral lesion and thus qualify as \"takes.\" The image below has an area of erythema but no ce ntral lesion and is cla ssified as a \" non-take.\" Page 6.52The image bel ow has neither eryth ema nor a c entral lesion and is Azar, LTJG, Bethesda, MD; Black and whi te image: Stephen Heyse, MD, National In stitutes of Healt h Page last reviewe d Augus t 5, 2004 Normal Primary Vaccinat ion Reactions A normal primary vaccination appe ars as a pa pule in 3-4 days, a nd rapidly progresses to a vesicle with the surroundi ng erythema b y the 5th-6th day. The vesicle center becomes depressed and progresses to a well-formed pustule by the 8th-9th da y. By the twelfth day, or s oon thereafter, the pustule crusts over forming a brown s cab, which progresses from the center o f the p ustule to the peri phery. After 2 .5 to 3 weeks, the scab detaches a nd a well-formed scar remains. Normal Reactio Vesicle g scar Rarely , in some f irst-time or dist antly vaccinated (re-vaccinee) seemin gly appropriat vaccination techni ques may resul t in no reacti on. One should assu me that the individual is not immune and repeat attempts sho uld be made t o achieve a major response or \" take.\" At least one repeat vacci nation wi th a different vaccine vial should be given, switchi ng skin sites on the same arm or usi ng the other arm. If the second vaccination is unsuccessful, cons ultation should be obtained to determi ne if the vaccination tech nique was flawed (prima ry or re-vaccinee), the vaccine was non-viable (first-time or re-vacci nee), or the vaccinee still had immunity from a previous va ccination (re-vacci nee). Systemic symptoms: S ystemic symptoms are expect ed and usually occur between 8 -10 da ys after vaccination when the vacci ne site reacti on reaches t he pea k of the inflammatory response. These include: Soreness at the vacci nation site Intense erythema ringin g the vaccination site Malaise Lymp hadenopath y (local) Myalgia, headache, chills, nausea, fatigue Fever Historically, the occu rrence of these normal r eactions varied co nsiderably from stud y to s tudy as shown in ranges demonstrated in the table belo w. They also varied be tween primary vaccinees (higher rate s of sympto ms) and revacci nees (lower rates of symptoms). Lymp hadenopathy 25.0 - 50.0 % Myalgia, headache, chills, nausea, fatigue 0.3 - 37.0 % Fever > 3 7.7\u00b0 C 2.0 - 16.0 % A recent NIH stud y, evaluating diluted a nd undiluted smallpox vaccine in adults receiv ing their first vaccination, reported the foll owing symptom rates during the 14 days following vacci nation. These rates are si milar to tho se seen in previous studies. Lymp hadenopath y 54% Myalgia an d chills, 20% Headache Nausea 20% Fatigue 5 0% Fever > 3 7.7\u00b0 C 10% Page 6.54 More Examples of Major or \"Take\" Reactions to Smallpox Vaccination Formation by days 6 -8 post-vac cination of a papu le, vesicle, ulc er, or crusted central les ion, surrounded by an area of induration signifies a response to vaccinati on; this event is referred to as a major rea ction or a \"take,\" a nd usually results in a scar . Page 6.55 SMALLPOX FACT SHEET \u0096 Information for Clinicians Advers e ation (vaccinia) is gen and effective means of prev enting smallpo x. However, in a number of individuals, smallp ox vaccinatio n can result in untowar d effects and adverse r eactions. Most are totally benign, but may be alarming in appearance. Some are serious, but treatabl e. A few, which rarely occur, are serious, lif e threatening and can be fatal. Se vere adverse reactions a re more common in person s receiv ing prim ary vaccination compared to those being revaccinated. Local Reactions Primary vaccination can produ ce swel ling and tenderness o f regional lymph nodes beginning 3 to 10 days after vacci nation and in some cases persisting up to 2 to 4 weeks after the skin lesion has healed. Other norm al local reac tions can include o local satellite lesions (which appear simi lar to the primary lesion ), o considerabl e local ede ma, o what may be con fused with bacterial cel lulitis, but is simply intense inflammat ion accompanying the va ccinati on (viral cellu litis). In a recent study of adult primary vaccinees, 36% were sufficientl y ill or recreati onal acti vities or to ha ve trouble sleeping. Systemic Reactions In a recent study, 17% of ad ult primary vaccinees experi enced fever of at l east 100\u00b0F within two weeks of va ccination; 7 % had a fever of 101\u00b0F or more, and 1.4 % experienced a fever of 102 \u00b0F or more. Beyond two weeks, fever was recorded in 0.3 % of vaccinees. Other expected sy stemic react ions include malaise, soren ess at the vaccination site, myalgia, local lymphadenopat hy, and in tense eryt hema rin ging the vaccination site. A vari ety of erythemat ous or urticarial rashes occur ap proximately 1 0 days a fter primary vaccination in one pers on per 3700 vaccinated. o Vaccinees who develop these rashe s are us ually afebrile a nd the rash resolv es spontaneo usly within 2 to 4 day s. o Rarely , a more seriou s rash , mu ltiforme ( or Stev ens-Johnson syndrome) occurs. In a recent study of adult primary vaccinees, 36% were sufficientl y ill or recreati onal acti Inadver tent Inoc ulation Successful vaccination produces a lesion at the vacci nation site. Begi nning abou t four days after vaccination, the florid site contai ns high titers o f vaccinia virus. This s urface is easily transferred to the hands and to fomites, especially since itch ing is a common part of the local react ion. Accidental implantati on occurs due to trans fer of vaccinia virus from the prim ary si te to othe r parts of the body, or to other individuals. This is the most freque nt complication of smallp ox vaccination (529 per mi llion primary vaccinees), for approx imately half of all compl ications of primary vaccination and revaccination.* Lesions of inadvertent in oculation can occur anywhere on t he body , but the most common si tes are the face , eyelid, nose, mouth , genitalia, and rectum . Lesions in ec zematous s kin, in disrupted skin Page 6.56and in the eye pose special h azards, as the infection can be ex tensive in skin lesio ns and a threat to eyesight in the eye. Most l esions heal without specific treatment. Generalized Vaccinia Generalized vaccinia consists of ve sicles or pustules appe aring on normal skin distant from t he vaccination site. In the past, it was estimated to occur in 242 per mi llion primary vaccinees.* It is believ ed to result from a v accinia viremia with skin manifestations. Most ras hes labeled as generalize d vacci nia produce onl y minor illness wi th little residual damage. The rash is generally self-limited an d usually requires on ly support ive therapy . However, patients with underlying immunosuppresse d illnesses may ha ve a toxi c cours e and require Vacci nia Immune Eczema Vaccinatum Eczema vaccinatum is local ized or systemic s pread of va ccinia virus. In the past , it was estimated to oc cur in 10-39 per mi llion pri mary vaccinees.* Transfer of vaccinia virus ca n occur from autoi noculation or from contact with a vaccinee whose lesion is in the florid st ages. Individuals with eczem a or atop ic dermat itis are at increased risk. Eczema vaccinatum can occur regardless of whether the eczema /atopic dermatit is is active at t he time of vacci nation. Virus impla nted in disrupted skin (may be at multiple sites) spreads f rom cell t o cell produ cing extensive lesions dependent o n extent of abno rmal skin. Treatment should include hospitalization and urgent treatm ent with VIG. Mortality has been prevented in patients treated promptly and a dequately. Severe cases and fatalities have been observe d after co ntact of rece ntly vaccinated persons with persons who have ac tive eczema/atopi c dermati tis or dermatitis. Vaccinia Keratitis Vaccinia keratitis results in lesions of corne a due to accidental imp lantation of vaccinia virus, and is pot entially threatening to eyesigh t. Symptoms appear ten days after transfer of vaccinia virus. Left untreated, considerable corn eal scarrin g may result as lesion heals resu lting in significant impairmen t of vision. Topical antivi ral agents are the treatment of choice; therapy should be det ermined in immedi ate consul with an so necrosum, is a severe, pot entially fata l illness characterized by progressive necrosi s in the ar ea of vacci nation, ofte n with metas tatic lesions (e.g. , lesions at places other th an the vaccination site). In the past , it was estimated tha t progressi ve va ccinia occu rred in approx imately 1 to 2 per million primary vaccinations, a nd was almo st always fatal before the i ntroduction of VIG and an tiviral agents.* Rare i n the past, i t may be a greate r threat today, given the larger pro portion of susceptible persons in the population and the greater number with immunoco mpromise. Nearly all instances have been i n peopl e with defined c ell-mediated immune d efect (T-cell deficiency) . Prompt hospitalization and aggres sive use of VIG are required. Massive dos es of VIG ar e necessary to co ntrol vir emia. Up to 10 ml per k g of intramuscular VIG has been used. There is n o proven antiviral therapy . Preliminary studies wit h cidof ovir show some an tiviral effect in vitro; studies in animals are pen ding. Immediate consultation with the CDC is recommend ed to determine if any experimental antiviral drugs are available. Post-Vaccinial Encephalitis Encephalitis or meningoencephalitis following vaccination has been reported in about 3 to 12 per million primary vaccinees; how many such cases are coincidental in time an d how many are related to the vaccination itself is impossible to know.* Because many different infectious agents and non-infectious proce sses can be responsible, it is often impossible to establish the etiology. Most ca ses are believed to result from autoimmune or allergic reactions rather than direct viral invasion of the nervous system. In general, this is a severe disease with high mortality and morbidity. Approximately 15-25% percent of affected vaccinees wi th this complication die, and 25% develop permanent neurological sequelae. There is no specific therapy. Supportive care, anticonvulsants and hospitalization in intensive care may be required in individual cases. VIG is not effective and is not recommended. Fetal Vaccinia Fetal vaccinia is a rare complication of smallpox vaccination. Fewer than 50 cases of fetal vaccinia infectio n have been reported, usually after primary vaccination of the mother in early pregnancy. Fetal vaccinia usually results in stillbirth or death of the infant soon after delivery. Smallpox vaccine is not known to caus e congenital malformations. Death Death resulting from smallpox vaccination is rare, in the past approximately 1 to 2 primary vaccinees died per million vaccinated.* Death is most often the result of postvacci nial encephalitis or progressive vaccinia. Possible Causal Association Between Smallpox Vaccination and Myopericarditis Data from recent smallpox vaccinations have been found to be consistent with a causal association between vaccination and myopericarditis, although this is not proven. Persons receiving smallpox vaccine should be informed that myopericarditis is a potential complication of smallpox vaccination and that they should seek medical attention if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of cardiac disease after vaccination. * Adverse event rates presented here are primarily from data collected in the 1960s. Rates in the United States today may be higher because there may be more persons at risk from 1) immune suppression from cancer, cancer therapy, organ transp lantation, and other illnesses, such as HIV/AIDS, and 2) eczema or atopic dermatitis. Rates may be lowe r for persons previously vaccinated. This fact sheet is a brief overview of reactions fo llowing smallpox vaccination.

The Clinical Evaluation Tools f or Smal lpox Vaccin e Adverse Reactions are intended to be used by trained clin icians. 1. Choose the appropriate C linical Evaluation Tool using the title as a gu ide. 2. Determine the type of potential smal lpox vaccine adv erse react ion. if the pati ent has a toxic or no ntoxic appearanc e if applicable to the To ol (use bot h tools if toxicity is difficult to determine). if the patient is a smallpox vaccine recipi ent (vaccinee) or a close conta ct of a smallpox vaccine recipient. 3. Work through the b oxes in the Clinical Evaluation Tool to determi ne if your pati ent fi ts one or more of the descriptions. 4. Consider t he differential diagn osis. The Clinical Evaluation Tools list clinical conditions not related to the smal lpox vacci ne that should be considered; this list is not exhaustive. 5. After narrowi ng the di agnosti c consi derations, read abou t the con ditions in more det ail (see question on more information about smallpox vaccine ad verse reactions). 6. Review the diagn ostic, treatment, and report ing information prov ided in the Clinical Evaluation Tool and co ntact your state/local heal th department and CDC as indic ated. Page 6.59What do the colors mean in th e Clinical Evaluation Tools? To assist clinicians triage and manage patients some of the Clinical Evaluation Tools are color coded. The morbidity and mortality risk legend is as follows: Green - Low Risk Clinical presentation/ diagnosis that is normal, mild, or self-limiting. Low risk of progression to a more severe condition. Provide routine/ symptomatic care and observe patient as indicated. Yellow - Moderate Risk Clinical presentation/ diagnosis that may require medical intervention, shares similar features to a more severe condition or has potential to progress to a severe condition. Observe patient closel y and manage as clinically indicated. Red - High Risk Clinical presentation/diagnosis which carries a high risk of morbidity and may be life threatening. Initiate urgent clinical care and provide appropriate interventions. These patients usually require medical intervention and hospitalization. What is the difference between a \"t oxic\" and \"nontoxic\" appearance? The terms \"toxic\" and \"nontoxic\" are clinical de scriptors. They are determined based on the appearance of the patient to an ex perienced clinician. Toxicity does not refer to whether or not the etiology of the patient's condition is infectious nor does it refer solely to the presence of systemic symptoms, such as fever. Although determining to xicity is subjective, ce rtain signs and symptoms may be associated with toxicity. For example, toxic patients may have: abnormal vitals signs (including high fever, tachycardia, and decr eased blood pressure) signs of poor perfusion (shock) alterations in mental status inability to maintain hydration without intravenous fluids Where do I call to receive clinical consul tation for a potential smallpox vaccine adverse reaction with or without a request for release of Vaccinia Immune Globulin (VIG) (first line agent) or Cidofovir (second line agent)? 1. Civilian health care providers who need clinical consultation with or without release of Vaccinia Immune Globulin (VIG) (first lin e agent) or Cidofovir (second line agent) for potential smallpox vaccine adverse re actions should contac t their state/local health department or the CDC Clinicia n Information Line at (877) 554-4625. 2.

Information for Clinicia ns and Public Health Professionals Medical Management of Smallpox (Vaccini a) Vaccine Adverse Reac tions: Vaccinia Immune Globulin Smallpox vaccin ation (vaccinia) is a gen erally safe and effective mean s to prevent smallpox . However, in a number of individuals, smallpox vaccination can result i n untoward effects a nd adverse reactions. The majority of adverse reacti ons caused by the smallpox vaccine are mild to moderate complication s that resolve on their own. Serious reacti ons are rare, but can be fa tal. There are two medications that may help persons who have cert ain serious reactions to the smallpox vacci ne; immune gl obulin (VIG) an d cidofovir. VIG has been extensively used in the past and f elt (but not shown in controlled st udies) to be effecti ve. Cidofovi r may be effe ctive based on studies in animals. Treatment with these medications may require the vaccine reci pient to be in the hospital. They are in vestigat ional and may ca use a number of serious side effects themselves. Vaccinia Immune G lobulin (V IG) Vaccin ia immune globulin (VIG) is a produ ct used to treat certai n serious adverse reactions caused b y smallpox vaccine. There are ab out 2,700 treatm ent doses o f VIG (eno ugh for predicted reacti ons wi th more than 27 mi llion people). Additional doses of VIG are being produced this year. VIG was pr oduced in the 1960s from plasma ob tained from recently vaccinated donors. It contai ned a high titer of an ti-vacci nia neutra lizing antibody. Because it contai ned a hi gh proportion of aggregated protein it was admi nistered sole ly by the intramu scular rou te and could not be used i ntravenousl y. An effort is underway to produ ce new lots of VIG that will meet the stan dards for intravenous immu ne globu requ ire new recommen dations for both dosage and preferred method of administration. The new IV-VIG has a low level of aggregat ed protein, allowing it to be used by either the IM or IV rou te. Intravenous VIG w ill be most likely administ ered at a lower do se than the intramuscular pr eparation. VIG I ndications, P recauti ons and Contraindications Historically, VIG h as been indicated for accident al impl antation involving extensive ssive vaccinia. VIG is NOT recommended for mild instances of accidental implantati on, mi ld or limited generalized vaccinia, erythema mu ltiforme, or en cephalitis post-vaccinat ion. For information on the adver se ons menti oned above, go to Use of VIG wit h Vaccina tion In some in stances, VIG w as given concomitantly with vaccination to .prev ent. complicat ions in a suscept ible person . Not enough is known about the efficacy of this practice to recommend i ts use. Furthermore, there is cu rrently an insufficient amou nt of VIG to ylactically when the benefi ts are un certai n. Page 6.67Dosage When it was used in the 1950s-1970s, the dosage of VIG varied. In general an initial dose of 0.6 ml/kg body weight was injected intramuscularly an d subsequent administrati on determined by the course of illness. In severe cases of eczema vaccinatum and progre ssive vaccinia as much as 1-10 ml/kg was used. These large doses were split into smaller units, and injected at multiple sites spread out over time. Frequency of Use Data from a CDC survey indicates that VIG was ad ministered at a rate of 47 uses per 1 million primary vaccinees and 2 uses per million revaccinees. Cidofovir Another drug that may be used to treat ce rtain serious smallpox vaccine reactions is cidofovir, an antiviral drug marketed as Vistide. Cidofovir is currently licensed for the treatm ent of CMV retinitis and has demonstrated antiviral activity against poxviruses in vitro, and against cowpox and vaccinia viruses in mice. However, its use for the treatment of vaccinia adverse reacti ons is restricted under an Investigational New Drug (IND) protocol. Under the IND, cidofovir would only be used when VIG was not efficacious. Renal toxicity is a known adverse reaction of cidofovir. Obtaining VIG and Cidofovir Indications for VIG/cidofovir release Vaccinia Immune Globulin (VIG) and cidofovir are indicated for the treatment of certain serious smallpox vaccine adverse events, including progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, generalized vaccinia (severe form or if underlying illness), and inadvertent inoculation (if judged to be se vere due to the number of lesions, toxicity of affected individual, or significant pain). VIG is recommended as the first line of therapy. Cidofovir may be considered as a secondary treatment, and will only be releas ed by CDC after all inventories of VIG have been exhausted, after a patient fails to improve with VIG treatment, or as a last effort for a patient who is otherwise near death. VIG and cidofovir are available for civilians through the CDC under Investigational New Drug (IND) protocols for treatment of specific smallpox vaccine reactions. Based on the anticipated number of adverse events resultin g from the planned vaccination program for healthcare workers, CDC.s supply of VIG should be adequate. Physicians at military facilities may request VIG by calling the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Dise ases (USAMRIID) at 301-619-2257 or 888-USA-RIID and asking for the physician on call. Process for obtaining VIG/cidofovir unde r Investigational Ne w Drug Protocol (IND) Physicians should first contact their State Health Department when seeking consultation for civilian patients experiencing a severe or unexpected adverse event following smallpox vaccination or when requesting VIG or cidofovir. If further consultation is required, or VIG or cidofovir is recommended, the phys ician will be referred to the CDC Clinical Information Line (CIL) at 1-877-554-4625 . The nurses staffing the CIL will take basic information and then expedite the call to the CDC Smallpox Vaccine Adverse Events Clinical Consultation Team. The CDC Clinical Consultation Team wi ll provide in-depth consultation and will facilitate VIG or cidofovir release as appropriate. According to FDA regulations, VIG or cidofovir released from the CDC must be administered according to their investigational new drug protocols (IND). The IND mandates that the treating physician must become a co-investigato r. The responsibilities of the co-investigator are primarily to complete follow-up forms describi ng the clinical status of the patient being treated with VIG and/or cidofo vir, including the prompt repo rt of any significant adverse reaction in the recipient. Detailed informat ion on the requirements of the IND will be shipped with the products. Details on the process for requesting VIG from USAMRIID for vaccinate d military personnel with adverse reactions may be obtained at http://www.smallpox.army.mil/resource/vig.asp?ste=milvax. Shipment of VIG/cidofovir VIG/cidofovir will be shipped by the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile (NPS). The CDC Smallpox Vaccine Adverse Events Clinical Consultation Team will coordinate the shipment of VIG/cidofovir with NPS. The cost of VIG and cidofovir and the cost of shipping will be covered by the U.S. Government. Arrival of sh ipments should be expected within 12 hours of the approval for release. Smallpox Vaccination and Adverse Reactions </P> Recommendations and Reports February 21, 2003 / 52(RR04);1-28 Smallpox Vaccination and Adverse Reactions Guidance for Clinicians Prepared by Joanne Cono, M.D.1 Christine G. Casey, M.D.2 David M. Bell, M.D.3 1Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Program National Center for Infectious Diseases 2Epidemiology and Surveillance Division National Immunization Program 3Office of the Director National Center for Infectious Diseases The material in this report originated in the National Center for Infectious Diseases, James M. Hughes, M.D., Director, and the Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Program, Charles Schable, M.S., Acting Director; and the National Immunization Program, Walter A. Orenstein, M.D., Director, and the Epidemiology and Surveillance Division, Melinda Wharton, M.D., Director. Summary The guidance in this report is for evaluation and treatment of patients with complications from smallpox vaccination in the preoutbreak setting. Information is also included related to reporting adverse events and seeking specialized consultation and therapies for these events. The frequencies of smallpox vaccine-associated adverse events were identified in studies of the 1960s. Because of the unknown prevalence of risk factors among today's population, precise predictions of adverse reaction rates after smallpox vaccination are unavailable. The majority of adverse events are minor, but the less-frequent serious adverse reactions require immediate evaluation for diagnosis and treatment. Agents for treatment of certain vaccine-associated severe adverse reactions are vaccinia immune globulin (VIG), the first-line therapy, and cidofovir, the second-line therapy. These agents will be available under Investigational New Drug (IND) protocols from CDC and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). Smallpox vaccination in the preoutbreak setting is contraindicated for persons who have the following conditions or have a close contact with the following conditions: 1) a history of atopic dermatitis (commonly referred to as eczema), irrespective of disease severity or activity; 2) active acute, chronic, or exfoliative skin conditions that disrupt the epidermis; 3) pregnant women or women who desire to become pregnant in the 28 days after vaccination; and 4) persons who are immunocompromised as a result of human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, autoimmune conditions, cancer, radiation treatment, immunosuppressive medications, or other immunodeficiencies. Additional contraindications that apply only to vaccination candidates but do not include their close contacts are persons with smallpox vaccine-component allergies, women who are breastfeeding, those taking topical ocular steroid medications, http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm (1 of 43)8/20/2004 8:35:34 AM Page 6.70Smallpox Vaccination and Adverse Reactions </P> those with moderate-to-severe intercurrent illness, and persons aged <18 years. In addition, history of Darier disease is a contraindication in a potential vaccinee and a contraindication if a household contact has active disease. In the event of a smallpox outbreak, outbreak-specific guidance will be disseminated by CDC regarding populations to be vaccinated and specific contraindications to vaccination. Vaccinia can be transmitted from a vaccinee's unhealed vaccination site to other persons by close contact and can lead to the same adverse events as in the vaccinee. To avoid transmission of vaccinia virus (found in the smallpox vaccine) from vaccinees to their close contacts, vaccinees should wash their hands with warm soapy water or hand rubs containing >60% alcohol immediately after they touch their vaccination site or change their vaccination site bandages. Used bandages should be placed in sealed plastic bags and can be disposed of in household trash. Smallpox vaccine adverse reactions are diagnosed on the basis of clinical examination and history, and certain reactions can be managed by observation and supportive care. Adverse reactions that are usually self-limited include fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia, chills, local skin reactions, nonspecific rashes, erythema multiforme, lymphadenopathy, and pain at the vaccination site. Other reactions are most often diagnosed through a complete history and physical and might require additional therapies (e.g., VIG, a first-line therapy and cidofovir, a second-line therapy). Adverse reactions that might require further evaluation or therapy include inadvertent inoculation, and fetal vaccinia. Inadvertent inoculation occurs when vaccinia virus is transferred from a vaccination site to a second location on the vaccinee or to a close contact. Usually, this condition is self-limited and no additional care is needed. Inoculations of the eye and eyelid require evaluation by an ophthalmologist and might require therapy with topical antiviral or antibacterial medications, VIG, or topical steroids. GV is characterized by a disseminated maculopapular or vesicular rash, frequently on an erythematous base, which usually occurs 6--9 days after first-time vaccination. This condition is usually self-limited and benign, although treatment with VIG might be required when the patient is systemically ill or found to have an underlying immunocompromising condition. Infection-control precautions should be used to prevent secondary transmission and nosocomial infection. EV occurs among persons with a history of atopic dermatitis (eczema), irrespective of disease severity or activity, and is a localized or generalized papular, vesicular, or pustular rash, which can occur anywhere on the body, with a predilection for areas of previous atopic dermatitis lesions. Patients with EV are often systemically ill and usually require VIG. Infection-control precautions should be used to prevent secondary transmission and nosocomial infection. PV is a rare, severe, and often fatal complication among persons with immunodeficiencies, characterized by painless progressive necrosis at the vaccination site with or without metastases to distant sites (e.g., skin, bones, and other viscera). This disease carries a high mortality rate, and management of PV should include aggressive therapy with VIG, intensive monitoring, and tertiary-level supportive care. Anecdotal experience suggests that, despite treatment with VIG, persons with cell-mediated immune deficits have a poorer prognosis than those with humoral deficits. Infection-control precautions should be used to prevent secondary transmission and nosocomial infection. Central nervous system disease, which includes postvaccinial encephalopathy (PVE) and postvaccinial encephalomyelitis (or encephalitis) (PVEM), occur after smallpox vaccination. PVE is most common among infants aged <12 months. Clinical symptoms of central nervous system disease indicate cerebral or cerebellar dysfunction with headache, fever, vomiting, altered mental status, lethargy, seizures, and coma. PVE and PVEM are not believed to be a result of replicating vaccinia virus and are diagnoses of exclusion. Although no specific therapy exists for PVE or PVEM, supportive care, anticonvulsants, and intensive care might be required. Fetal vaccinia, resulting from vaccinial transmission from mother to fetus, is a rare, but serious, complication of smallpox vaccination during pregnancy or shortly before conception. It is manifested by skin lesions and organ involvement, and often results in fetal or neonatal death. No known reliable intrauterine diagnostic test is available to confirm fetal infection. Given the rarity of congenital vaccinia among live-born infants, vaccination during pregnancy should not http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm (2 of 43)8/20/2004 8:35:34 AMSmallpox Vaccination and Adverse Reactions </P> ordinarily be a reason to consider termination of pregnancy. No known indication exists for routine, prophylactic use of VIG in an unintentionally vaccinated pregnant woman; however, VIG should not be withheld if a pregnant woman develops a condition where VIG is needed. Other less-common adverse events after smallpox vaccination have been reported to occur in temporal association with smallpox vaccination, but causality has not been established. Prophylactic treatment with VIG is not recommended for persons or close contacts with contraindications to smallpox vaccination who are inadvertently inoculated or exposed. These persons should be followed closely for early recognition of adverse reactions that might develop, and clinicians are encouraged to enroll these persons in the CDC registry by calling the Clinician Information Line at 877-554-4625. To request clinical consultation and IND therapies for vaccinia-related adverse reactions for civilians, contact your state health department or CDC's Clinician Information Line (877-554-4625).

Physicians at military medical facilities can request VIG or cidofovir by calling the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at 301-619-2257 or 888-USA-RIID. Introduction Smallpox vaccine is made from live vaccinia virus and protects against the disease smallpox. It does not contain variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox (1). Because viral replication and shedding occurs at the vaccination site (beginning 2--5 days postvaccination), unintended transmission is possible from the time immediately after vaccination until the scab separates from the skin (approximately 2--3 weeks) (2). Although virus exists in the scab, it is bound in the fibrinous matrix, and the scab is not believed to be highly infectious. Viral shedding might be of shorter duration among revaccinees (2,3). During the smallpox eradication era, transmission usually required close interaction and occurred most often in the home (4) (see Transmission of Vaccinia Virus; see Preventing Contact Transmission). Worldwide, different vaccinia strains have been used for production of smallpox vaccine, but all U.S. vaccine formulations contain the New York City Board of Health (NYCBOH) vaccinia strain. This strain has been reported to be less reactogenic (i.e., it causes fewer adverse events) than other strains (1). U.S. National Pharmaceutical Stockpile (NPS) stores of smallpox vaccine include two previously manufactured calf-lymph--derived vaccines, Dryvax \u00ae (Wyeth Laboratories Inc., Marietta, Pennsylvania), and Aventis Pasteur vaccine (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania); and two newly developed vaccines from Acambis/Baxter Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, Massachusetts), ACAM1000, which is grown in human embryonic lung cell culture (MRC-5), and ACAM2000, which is grown in African green monkey cells (VERO cells) (CDC Drug Services, unpublished data, 2002). Prospective studies are under way to determine the reactogenicity of the newer cell culture vaccines. Dryvax is the vaccine used in the current U.S. smallpox vaccination effort. CDC is holding other vaccines in reserve (5). Smallpox vaccination in the preoutbreak setting is contraindicated for persons who have the following conditions or have a close contact with the following conditions: 1) a history of atopic dermatitis (commonly referred to as eczema), irrespective of disease severity or activity; 2) active acute, chronic, or exfoliative skin conditions that disrupt the epidermis; 3) pregnant women or women who desire to become pregnant in the 28 days after vaccination; and 4) persons who are immunocompromised as a result of human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, autoimmune conditions, cancer, radiation treatment, immunosuppressive medications, or other immunodeficiencies. Additional contraindications that apply only to vaccination candidates but do not include their close contacts are persons with smallpox vaccine-component allergies, women who are breastfeeding, those taking topical ocular steroid medications, those with moderate-to-severe intercurrent illness, and persons aged <18 years. In addition, history of Darier disease is a contraindication in a potential vaccinee and a contraindication if a household contact has active disease. In the event of a smallpox outbreak, outbreak-specific guidance will be disseminated by CDC regarding populations to be vaccinated and specific contraindications to vaccination. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm (3 of 43)8/20/2004 8:35:34 AMSmallpox Vaccination and Adverse Reactions </P> Normal Vaccination Progression Smallpox vaccine is administered by using the multiple-puncture technique with a bifurcated needle ( 6). The vaccinia virus replicates in the dermis of the skin; 3--5 days later, a papule forms at the vaccination site of immunocompetent vaccine- na\u00efve persons (also referred to as first-time or primary vaccinees) (1). The papule becomes vesicular (approximately day 5--8), then pustular, and usually enlarges to reach maximum size in 8--10 days. The pustule dries from the center outward and forms a scab that separates 14--21 days after vaccination, usually leaving a pitted scar ( Figures 1-- 3). Formation by days papule, vesicle, ulcer, or crusted lesion, surrounded by an area of induration signifies a response to vaccination; this event is referred to as a major reaction or a take, and usually results in a scar. During the smallpox eradication era, persons with vaccination scars had much lower attack rates when exposed to smallpox cases than did nonvaccinated persons. Therefore, a take has been a surrogate correlate of immunity to smallpox. Although the level of antibody that protects against smallpox infection is unknown, >95% of first-time vaccinees (i.e., persons receiving their first dose of smallpox vaccine) have increased neutralizing or hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers (7). Interpreting Vaccination Results Vaccination-site reactions are classified into two categories: major reactions and equivocal reactions (1). A major reaction indicates a successful vaccine take and is characterized by a pustular lesion or an area of definite induration or congestion surrounding a central lesion, which can be a scab or an ulcer. All other responses are equivocal reactions and are nontakes. Equivocal reactions can be caused by suboptimal vaccination technique, use of subpotent vaccine, or residual vaccinial immunity among previously vaccinated persons. Persons with equivocal reactions cannot be presumed to be immune to smallpox, and revaccination is recommended ( Figures 4 and 5). The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that response to vaccination be evaluated on postvaccination day 6, 7, or 8 (1). These are the days of peak viral replication, and the period during which take should be assessed for both first-time vaccinees and revaccinees. If the response to vaccination is evaluated too early (e.g., <6 days postvaccination), certain equivocal responses will look reactive because of dermal hypersensitivity to vaccinial proteins. These reactions are sometimes referred to as immediate reactions but are not successful takes. If the response to vaccination is evaluated too late (e.g., >8 days postvaccination), the vaccination take might be missed among persons with prior immunity to vaccinia who might experience a more rapid progression of the vaccination site. Responses among revaccinees that resolve in <6 days are sometimes referred to as accelerated reactions and are not successful takes. Expected Range of Vaccine Reactions A range of expected reactions occurs after vaccination. These normal reactions do not require specific treatment and can include fatigue, headache, myalgia, regional lymphadenopathy, lymphangitis, pruritis, and edema at the vaccination site, as well as satellite lesions, which are benign, secondary vaccinial lesions proximal to the central vaccination lesions (8) (Wyeth Laboratories. Dryvax [package insert]. Marietta, PA: Wyeth Laboratories, 1994). Historically, 21% of reactions associated with first-time vaccination caused the vaccinee to consult a physician (9). A recent vaccination trial was conducted among 680 adults, all of whom were first-time vaccinees (10). During the 14 days after vaccination, all reported having >1 of the following symptoms at some point: fatigue (50%), headache (40%), muscle aches and chills (20%), nausea (20%), and fever, defined as a temperature >37.7\u00baC or 100\u00baF (10%). Symptom duration was not reported. The majority of local symptoms were reported during the second week after vaccination and included pain at the vaccination site (86%), and regional lymphadenopathy (54%). Approximately one third of vaccinees were sufficiently ill to have trouble sleeping or to miss school, work, or recreational activities. Similar findings are reported by the CDC Smallpox Diary Card Database, a reporting system of postvaccination symptoms among 633 vaccinees who received smallpox vaccine during 2001--2002 (CDC, unpublished data, 2001--2002). In this series, postvaccination days 3--7 were the days when the majority of vaccinees (78%) reported their symptoms. In both series, symptoms were self-limited and http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm (4 of 43)8/20/2004 8:35:34 AMSmallpox Vaccination and Adverse Reactions </P> required only symptomatic care. During the smallpox eradication era, fever after vaccination occurred frequently but was less common among adults than children (CDC, unpublished data). For adults, fever is more frequently noted among first-time vaccinees than revaccinees (NIH, unpublished data, 2003). In one vaccination series involving children, approximately 70% experienced >1 day of temperatures >100 \u00baF during the 4--14 days after primary vaccination (7), and 15%--20% of children experienced temperatures >102\u00baF. After revaccination, 35% of children experienced temperatures >100\u00baF, and 5% experienced temperatures of >102\u00baF (11). Satellite lesions occasionally occur at the perimeter of the vaccination site and should not be confused with the early discrete vesicles that might coalesce into a central pox-like lesion. Satellite lesions are a benign finding, do not require treatment, and should be cared for as vaccination sites. ( Figure 6). Large Vaccination Reactions and Robust Takes Large vaccination reactions (i.e., >10 cm in diameter) at the site of inoculation occur in approximately 10% of first-time vaccinees and are expected variants of the typical evolution of the vaccination site (10). However, sometimes these large vaccination reactions have been reported as adverse events and misinterpreted as cellulitis, requiring antibiotic treatment. In the 1968 national surveillance of the United States for smallpox vaccine complications, 13 of 572 adverse event reports were for unusually large and painful robust takes (RTs) (9,12) ( Figures 7 and 8). Bacterial infection of the vaccination site is uncommon but affects children more often than adults, because children are more likely to touch and contaminate their vaccination sites. In a 1963 U.S. national survey, 433 complications were reported among 14 million smallpox vaccinees; of these, two were secondary bacterial infections of the vaccination site (13). One case resolved without sequelae, whereas the other resulted in a nonfatal case of acute streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Other reports describe the occurrence of bacterial infection at the vaccination site, but do not provide details regarding the causative organisms (9,12). Specimens for bacterial cultures can be obtained by using swabs or aspiration. Gram stains can detect normal skin flora and are useful only when unusual pathogens are present. If empiric antibacterial therapy is administered, therapy should be adjusted after the bacterial pathogen and its sensitivities to various antibacterial medications are known. Identifying RTs Differentiating an RT from bacterial cellulitis can be difficult. RTs occur 8--10 days postvaccination, improve within 72 hours of peak of symptoms, and do not progress clinically. Fluctuant enlarged lymph nodes are not expected and warrant further evaluation and treatment. In contrast, secondary bacterial infections typically occur within 5 days of vaccination or >30 days postvaccination, and unless treated, the infection will progress (14--16). The interval of onset to peak symptoms is the key factor in diagnosing RTs. Fever is not helpful in distinguishing RTs from bacterial cellulitis because it is an expected immunologic response to vaccinia vaccination. When an RT is suspected, management includes vigilant observation, patient education, and supportive care that includes rest of the affected limb, use of oral nonaspirin analgesic medications, as well as oral antipruritic agents. Salves, creams, or ointments, including topical steroids or antibacterial medications, should not be applied to the vaccination site. During 2001, CDC staff vaccinated 191 federal public health smallpox response team members; 9 vaccinees (5%) met the case definition for an RT, with an area of redness >7.5 cm with swelling, warmth, and pain at the vaccination site (CDC, unpublished data, 2002). Six vaccinees with RTs were treated for suspected bacterial cellulitis. Three affected vaccinees did not seek medical care and, therefore, did not receive antibiotic therapy. All affected vaccinees reported peak of symptoms 8--10 days after vaccination and improvement of symptoms within 24--72 hours whether they were treated with antibacterial medications. Cases did not cluster by age, sex, vaccination status, or vaccine lot number. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm (5 of 43)8/20/2004 8:35:34 AMSmallpox Vaccination and Adverse Reactions </P> To estimate an estimated rate of RTs, CDC staff conducted a limited survey and determined rates of 2% (2 of 99 persons) and 16% (13 of 80) (CDC, unpublished data, 2001). The different rates between clinics might be caused by different methods of case ascertainment. However, both clinics reported that irrespective of antibiotic therapy, symptoms peaked on postvaccination day 8--10, and improved within 24--72 hours. Antibacterial medications did not shorten the duration or lessen the severity of symptoms. Transmission of Vaccinia Virus Vaccinia can be transmitted from a vaccinee's unhealed vaccination site to other persons by close contact and can lead to the same adverse events as in the vaccinee. Cases arising from contact transmission have resulted in either eczema vaccinatum (EV) or inadvertent inoculation, and these cases occurred approximately 5--19 days after suspected exposure to the index case (17). In addition, two cases have been reported of contact transmission, which resulted in fetal vaccinia (18,19) (see Fetal Vaccinia). No data exist to indicate that vaccinia transmission occurs by aerosolization (17). Although one study reported successful recovery of the vaccinia virus from the oropharynx of children receiving other vaccine strains (20), droplet infection has not been epidemiologically implicated in transmission of vaccinia. In one unpublished study in the 1960s (J. Michael Lane, M.D., formerly Director, Smallpox Eradication Program, Communicable Disease Center, personal communication, 2002), researchers were unable to recover the NYCBOH vaccinia strain from the nasal swabs of healthy vaccinees. The low rate of contact vaccinia and the link to direct physical contact indicate that aerosol transmission does not occur. The overall transmission of contact vaccinia in the 1960s occurred in the range of 2--6/100,000 first-time vaccinations (4); infection-control precautions should be taken to reduce this likelihood (21). Preventing Contact Transmission Correct hand hygiene prevents the majority of inadvertent inoculations and contact transmissions after changing bandages or other contact with the vaccination site (21). The vaccination site can be left uncovered or covered with a porous bandage (e.g., gauze) ( 6). Preventing Contact Transmission Among Health-Care Workers To prevent nosocomial transmission of vaccinia virus, health-care workers when involved in direct patient care should keep their vaccination sites covered with gauze or a similar material to absorb exudates that contain vaccinia. This dressing should be covered with a semipermeable dressing to provide a barrier to vaccinia virus. Using a semipermeable dressing alone is not recommended because it might cause maceration of the vaccination site and prolong irritation and itching, which subsequently leads to increased touching, scratching, and contamination of hands. If maceration of the vaccination site occurs, the lesion should be left open to air to allow the vaccination site to dry during a period that includes no direct contact with patients or other persons. The vaccination site should be covered during direct patient care until the scab separates (21). Administrative leave should be considered for health-care workers who are unable to adhere to the recommended infection-control measures, which require that vaccination sites be covered during patient care duties (21). Preventing Contact Transmission in Other Settings Transmission of vaccinia is also possible in other settings when close personal contact with children or other persons occurs. In these situations, the vaccination site should be covered with gauze or a similar absorbent material, and long-sleeved clothing should be worn. Careful attention should be paid to handwashing (21), which should be done with soapy warm water or hand-rub solutions that are >60% alcohol-based. Historically, the home was the setting where the majority of contact transmission occurred (4), presumably because of intimate contact and relaxed infection-control measures. Recognizing Vaccinia Virus Transmission http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm (6 of 43)8/20/2004 8:35:34 AMSmallpox Vaccination and Adverse Reactions </P> When evaluating a skin or other condition consistent with vaccinia, a history of smallpox vaccination and exposure to a household or close contact who has been vaccinated recently will often provide a source of the virus. A history of exposure to vaccinia might be difficult to obtain. A person might have had an inadvertent exposure and be unaware of being exposed to vaccinia virus, and rarely, persons have been deliberately inoculated by others as a way to vaccinate outside the approved vaccination programs (and possibly unwilling to acknowledge this exposure to vaccinia). In either case, clinicians should obtain a thorough medical history, including possible vaccinia exposure and risk factors for smallpox vaccine-related adverse reactions. Clinicians should counsel these patients regarding appropriate infection-control measures, care of their lesions, and when appropriate, the infectious risks incurred through deliberate inoculation of others. Follow-up of the patient and administration of appropriate treatment are critical if a vaccinia-related adverse reaction develops. In addition, these patients might be at increased risk for infection from bloodborne pathogens, and they should be counseled and treated appropriately. Adverse Reactions* Adverse reactions caused by smallpox vaccination range from mild and self-limited to severe and life-threatening (9,12,13,22,23). Certain smallpox vaccine reactions are similar to those caued by other vaccines (e.g., high fever, anaphylaxis, and erythema multiforme [EM]). Other adverse reactions specific to complications can occur among vaccinees or their contacts who have been inadvertently inoculated with vaccinia (3,7, 24--26). The information regarding adverse events presented in this report is primarily based on reports from the 1960s. Although the vaccine remains unchanged, supportive care and therapeutic care options have improved. The U.S. population has also changed and now has a higher proportion of persons with contraindications to smallpox vaccination and who are at increased risk for adverse reactions. This group includes persons with atopic dermatitis (commonly referred to as eczema), or persons who are immunocompromised as a result of cancer, radiation, autoimmune conditions, immunosuppressive therapies, or immune deficiencies (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]). Updated reports regarding the frequency of adverse reactions will be disseminated by CDC as data become available. This guidance is for evaluation and treatment of patients with complications from smallpox vaccination administration during preoutbreak situations. In the event of a smallpox outbreak, considering smallpox disease will be necessary in the differential diagnosis of any recently vaccinated person who has an acute, generalized, vesicular, pustular rash illness. Until a determination is made regarding whether the rash is early smallpox disease or an adverse reaction to smallpox vaccine, these patients should be presumed to be highly infectious and placed in contact and respiratory isolation immediately. Appropriate local, state, and federal health and security officials should be contacted (5). Treatments available for specific complications of smallpox vaccination include vaccinia immune globulin (VIG), cidofovir, and ophthalmic antivirals (see Ocular Vaccinial Infections and Therapy). None of these therapies have been tested in controlled clinical trials for efficacy against vaccinial infection. However, because worldwide historical experience with using VIG to treat vaccinia-related adverse events exists, it is the first-line therapy. It is available in intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) preparations under Investigational New Drug (IND) protocols through CDC and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). Cidofovir is an antiviral medication licensed for treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis among patients with AIDS. Cidofovir has been demonstrated to be nephrotoxic among humans and carcinogenic among animals. Cidofovir has never been used to treat vaccinia infections among humans. In animal models, cidofovir apparently protects against subsequent orthopoxvirus growth, if administered within 24 hours after experimental inoculation (27). However, no studies have demonstrated it to have an effect on orthopoxvirus infection after infection has been fully established. It will be available under IND protocols from CDC and DoD and should be considered second-line therapy for vaccinia complications (see Treatments). Frequencies of Adverse Reactions http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm (7 of 43)8/20/2004 8:35:34 AMSmallpox Vaccination and Adverse Reactions </P> Two primary sources are available regarding the frequency of adverse reactions from NYCBOH smallpox vaccine: the 1968 U.S. national survey (12) and the 1968 10-state survey (9) ( Table 1). These two studies used different methodologies, but are complementary. In the national survey, information was gathered from seven nationwide sources. The majority of the information concerning adverse reactions came from the American Red Cross VIG-distribution system. Reactions that did not require use of VIG and those for which VIG use was not warranted were less likely to be reported through this system. The national survey statistics should be considered minimal estimates of the risks from smallpox vaccination. In the 10-state survey, clinicians were actively contacted and urged to report all adverse reactions, including those considered less severe. For this reason, the 10-state survey data probably present a better estimate of the number of persons having adverse reactions. The range of frequencies for these two studies provides an estimate for the frequencies of adverse reactions that might be expected today (28) ( Table 1). A review of vaccinia-related deaths (68) during a 9-year period (1959--1966 and 1968) revealed that deaths occurred among first-time vaccinees as a result of PVE (52%; 36 cases) and PV (28%; 19 cases) and among contacts as a result of EV (18%; 12 cases) (23). The strain of vaccinia virus might correlate with the type and frequency of adverse reactions (1,12). All U.S. preparations of smallpox vaccine contain the NYCBOH strain, one of the less reactogenic strains (1). Therefore, the U.S. experience might not represent international experience, which reflects use of other vaccinia strains. Virulence of vaccinia strain is associated with risk for PVE and PVEM, as well as the likelihood of contact transmission (1,4,17). Anticipated Adverse Reactions Adverse reaction rates in the United States today might be higher than those previously reported because the proportion of persons at risk for adverse events is higher as a result of cancer, cancer therapy, radiation, immunomodulating medications, organ transplantation, and other illnesses (e.g., HIV/AIDS and eczema or atopic dermatitis). Adverse reactions might be better than previously expected because of advances in medical care. Rates for all adverse reactions are lower for persons previously vaccinated (4). During the smallpox eradication era, approximately two thirds of complications after smallpox vaccination might have been preventable and might have been avoided with better screening (13,29). However, screening will not eliminate risk, because the risk factors for certain adverse reactions have not been clearly defined and screening success is subject to recall bias and the participant's willingness to disclose personal information. Stringent medical screening of potential vaccinees for risk factors for adverse events, coupled with improved infection-control measures to prevent vaccinia transmission, will probably decrease preventable complications of vaccination. Common Adverse Reactions Local Skin Reactions Local skin reactions can occur after smallpox vaccination. These include allergic reactions to bandage and tape adhesives, RTs, and less commonly, bacterial infections of the vaccination site (4). Reactions to adhesives usually result in sharply demarcated lines of erythema that correspond to the placement of adhesive tape ( Figures 9 and 10). Patients have local pruritis but no systemic symptoms and are otherwise well. Frequent bandage changes, periodically leaving the vaccination site open to air, or a change to paper tape might alleviate symptoms. Care should be used to vary the positioning of tape or bandages. This condition is self-limited and resolves when bandages are no longer needed. Topical and oral steroid treatment for this reaction should be avoided because the site contains live vaccinia virus. Salves, creams, or ointments, including topical antibacterial medications, should not be applied to the vaccination site. Nonspecific Rashes Common nonspecific rashes associated with smallpox vaccination include fine reticular maculopapular patches ( Figure11). These rashes are believed to be caused by immune response to vaccination and do not contain vaccinia. Erythematous or http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm (8 of Adverse Reactions urticarial rashes occur approximately 10 days (range: 4--17 days) after first-time vaccination. The vaccinee is usually afebrile, and the rash resolves spontaneously within 2--4 days (8). Nonspecific rashes are usually self-limited. These persons appear well and benefit from simple supportive care measures (e.g., oral anti-antihistamine agents). Dermatologic Manifestations of Hypersensitivity Reactions EM, sometimes referred to as roseola vaccinia or toxic urticaria, might appear as different types of lesions, including macules, papules, urticaria, and typical bull's-eye (targetoid or iris) lesions (8,30). Because the number of clinical descriptions of vaccinia-associated EM rashes is limited, the following details are extrapolated from common descriptions of EM occurring after herpes simplex or mycoplasma infections. The hallmark target lesion of EM associated with other infections usually appears with a central, dark papule or vesicle, surrounded by a pale zone and a halo of erythema, usually within 10 days after viral infection (30). The limited clinical descriptions of EM after smallpox vaccination indicate that it follows a similar course (8). The rash of EM might be extremely pruritic, lasting <4 weeks, and patients benefit from administration of oral antipruritics (30) ( Figure 12). Less commonly, hypersensitivity reactions can appear as a more serious condition, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). SJS can also arise from EM and typically includes systemic symptoms with involvement of >2 mucosal surfaces (31) or 10% of body surface area. This condition requires hospitalization and supportive care (30) ( Figure 13). The role of systemic steroids for treatment of SJS is controversial; therefore, the decision to administer systemic steroids to patients with postvaccinial SJS should be made after consultation with specialists in this area (e.g., dermatologists, immunologists, or infectious disease specialists), according to the prevailing standard of care. VIG is not used to treat nonspecific rashes, EM, or SJS, because these lesions are probably a manifestation of a hypersensitivity reaction and are not believed to contain vaccinia virus. Vaccinia-Specific Adverse Reactions The following guidance related to recognizing, evaluating, and treating smallpox vaccine-related adverse reactions ( Table 2). Inadvertent Inoculation Inadvertent inoculation is a common but avoidable complication of smallpox vaccination (9,22). Inadvertent inoculation occurs when vaccinia virus is transferred from a vaccination site to a second location on the vaccinee or to a close contact. The most common sites involved are the face, eyelid, nose, mouth, lips, genitalia, and anus ( Figure 14). Among immunocompetent persons, lesions follow the same course as the vaccination site. Clinicians in the smallpox eradication era observed that when inadvertent inoculation of a vaccinee occurred close to the time of vaccination, the resulting secondary lesions matured at the same pace as the central lesion of the vaccination site. In contrast, lesions from inadvertent inoculation that occurred >5 days postvaccination appeared attenuated, which indicated that the developing immune response might limit the reaction (J. Michael Lane, M.D., formerly Director, Smallpox Eradication Program, Communicable Disease Center, personal communication, 2002) (22). A primary prevention strategy to avoid inadvertent inoculation is to instruct vaccinees and their close contacts to avoid touching or scratching the vaccination site from the time of vaccination until the scab separates. In addition, vigilant handwashing with soap and warm water or hand rubs containing >60% alcohol, after touching an unhealed vaccination site or changing a vaccination dressing is critical. Lesions from an inadvertent inoculation contain live vaccinia virus, and the same contact precautions necessary for a vaccination site are necessary for these secondary lesions. Persons at highest risk for inadvertent inoculation are younger persons (e.g., children aged 1--4 years) and those with disruption of the epidermis. Periocular and ocular implantation (hereafter referred to as ocular vaccinial disease) accounted for the majority of reported http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm (9 of 43)8/20/2004 8:35:34 AMSmallpox Vaccination and Adverse Reactions </P> inadvertent inoculations and were often noted within 7--10 days of vaccination among first-time vaccinees (22,32). Ocular vaccinial disease can occur in including blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelid), conjunctivitis, keratitis (inflammation of the cornea, including epithelial and stromal forms), iritis, or combinations thereof (33) ( Figures 15-- 19). When evaluating a patient with the new onset of a red eye or periocular vesicles, vaccinia infection should be considered and history of recent vaccinia exposure (e.g., smallpox vaccination or close contact with a vaccine recipient) should be sought. The goal of therapy of ocular disease is to prevent complications, including corneal scarring associated with keratitis ( Figures 17 and 18), and the patient should be comanaged with an ophthalmologist. In a limited study of vaccinia keratitis among rabbits, 1 dose of VIG did not alter the clinical course, but rabbits treated with 5 daily doses (2.5--5 times that recommended for humans) developed larger and more persistent corneal scars, compared with control animals (34). The 2001 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation states that VIG is contraindicated in a patient with vaccinial keratitis ( 6). However, in November 2002, this recommendation was reevaluated and modified by the Public Health Service (see Ocular Vaccinial Infections and Therapy). VIG should not be withheld if a comorbid condition exists that requires administration of VIG (e.g., EV or PV) and should be considered for severe ocular disease, except isolated keratitis. In these situations, VIG should be administered if the risk of the comorbid condition is greater than the potential risk of VIG-associated complications of keratitis (see Ocular Vaccinial Infections and Therapy). Uncomplicated inadvertent inoculation lesions are self-limited, resolving in approximately 3 weeks, and require no therapy. If extensive body surface area is involved, or severe ocular vaccinia infection (without keratitis) ( Figure 19), or severe manifestation of inoculation has occurred, treatment with VIG can speed recovery and prevent spread of disease. Ocular Vaccinial Infections and Therapy Ocular vaccinial infections account for the majority of inadvertent inoculations. However, data upon which to base treatment recommendations are limited. Published reports of treatment of human infections are predominantly case series reports concerning clinical experience with older antiviral drugs (e.g., idoxuridine [IDU] or interferon) or VIG. These studies did not employ the prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trials that are now standard; clinical details and follow-up information are often variable (35--38). None of the available topical ophthalmic antiviral agents have been studied among humans with ocular vaccinia disease, except in one case report, where vidarabine was apparently superior to IDU in treating blepharoconjunctivitis (38). Prophylaxis of the cornea with topical antiviral drugs is common ophthalmologic practice in treating ocular herpes simplex and varicella-zoster infections (33). Therapies that have been considered for treatment of ocular vaccinial infections include topical ophthalmic antiviral drugs (trifluridine King Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bristol, Tennessee] and Inc., Bristol, Tennessee]) and parenteral VIG. Trifluridine and vidarabine are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of vaccinia disease, although the product labels for trifluridine and vidarabine state that the drugs have in vitro and in vivo activity against vaccinia virus. Vidarabine is no longer being manufactured, but supplies might be available in certain areas. Among humans with GV and EV, VIG treatment decreases size and limits extension of vaccinial lesions within 24--48 hours. Consequently, VIG has been considered a means to prevent spread of facial vaccinia to the eye and spread of ocular vaccinia without corneal involvement. No evidence exists that VIG is effective in treating vaccinial infection of the cornea (i.e., vaccinial keratitis). Case reports exist of human patients with vaccinial keratitis not treated with VIG who apparently experienced more severe sequelae (including corneal scarring and disciform edema) than described in case reports where VIG therapy was used (35,39--41), as well as a case report concerning use of VIGIM in treating vaccinial keratitis in which corneal scarring did not develop (41). Case reports indicated efficacy of VIGIM in treating vaccinial blepharoconjunctivitis and blepharitis (32,40,42). To discuss treatment options for ocular vaccinia, CDC convened a meeting of ophthalmology and infectious disease consultants in November 2002. On the basis of available data and input from these consultants, this report offers the following guidance for clinicians: Suspected ocular vaccinia infections should be managed in consultation with an ophthalmologist to ensure a http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm (10 of 43)8/20/2004 8:35:34 AMSmallpox Vaccination and Adverse Reactions </P> thorough and accurate eye evaluation, including a slit-lamp examination, and the specialized expertise needed to manage potentially vision-threatening disease. Although vaccine splashes to the eye occur rarely because of the viscosity of smallpox vaccine, these occurrences should be managed by immediate eye-washing with water (avoid pressure irrigation, which can cause corneal abrasion) and a baseline evaluation by an ophthalmologist. In this situation, off-label prophylactic use of topical ophthalmic trifluridine or vidarabine has been recommended by ophthalmologists (CDC, unpublished data, 2002). Further treatment might not be necessary. Off-label use of topical ophthalmic trifluridine or vidarabine has been recommended by certain ophthalmologists (CDC, unpublished data, 2002) and can be considered for treatment of vaccinia infection of the conjunctiva or cornea. Prophylactic therapy with these drugs might also be considered to prevent spread to the conjunctiva and cornea if vaccinia lesions are present on the eyelid, including if near the lid margin, or adjacent to the eye. The potential benefits of these drugs for prophylaxis should be balanced against the minimal but potential risk of drug toxicity and of introducing virus into the eye by frequent manipulation. Topical antivirals should be continued until all periocular or lid lesions have healed and the scabs have fallen off, except that topical trifluridine usually is not used for >14 days to avoid possible toxicity. When used for >14 days, trifluridine can lead to superficial punctate keratopathy, which resolves on discontinuation of the medication. Topical vidarabine might be preferable for use among children because it can be compounded into an ointment that allows less frequent dosing and stings less initially than trifluridine. VIG should be considered for use in severe ocular disease when keratitis is not present (e.g., severe blepharitis or blepharoconjunctivitis). Severe ocular disease is defined as marked hyperemia, edema, pustules, other focal lesions, lymphadenophy, cellulitis, and fever. If keratitis is present with these conditions, consideration of possible VIG use must be weighed against evidence in an animal model for increased risk for corneal scar formation if a substantial dose is administered during multiple days. VIG can be considered if the ocular disease is severe enough to pose a substantial risk of impaired vision as a long-term outcome (e.g., vision-threatening lid malformation). If VIG is administered specifically to treat ocular disease in the presence of keratitis, treatment usually should be limited to 1 dose, and the patient or guardian should be informed of the possible risks and benefits before its use. Using VIG as recommended to treat other severe vaccinia disease (e.g., EV) is indicated, even in the presence of keratitis. VIG is not recommended for treating isolated keratitis. Topical ophthalmic antibacterials should be considered for prophylaxis of bacterial infection in the presence of keratitis, including if a corneal ulcer is present or steroids are used. In severe cases of keratitis (e.g., with an ulcer and stromal haze or infiltrate) and in iritis, topical steroids should be considered after the corneal epithelium is healed to decrease immune reaction; mydriatics are also indicated. Topical steroids should not be used without ophthalmologic consultation and should not be used acutely without topical antiviral therapy. Patients with ocular vaccinia infection, including with keratitis or iritis, should receive careful follow-up evaluation by an ophthalmologist to detect and treat possible late onset complications (e.g., scarring and immune reactions). Additional data from animal and human clinical studies are needed to improve the evidence base and to refine recommendations for ocular vaccinia disease. Physicians treating patients with ocular vaccinia infection are encouraged to enroll in studies designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VIG and available antiviral preparations for treatment of ocular complications. GV GV is characterized by a disseminated maculopapular or vesicular rash, frequently on an erythematous base, that usually occurs 6--9 days after first-time vaccination (1,8). The rash spans the spectrum of vaccinial lesions, from maculopapules to vesicles. Maculopapules can be mistaken for EM when they are accompanied by a substantial component of erythema (9) (J. Michael Lane, M.D., formerly Director, Smallpox Eradication Program, Communicable Disease Center, personal communication, 2002) ( Figure 20). In other instances, the pearly vesicles of GV resemble the lesions of smallpox; however, GV does not follow the centrifugal distribution that is characteristic of smallpox (1) ( Figure 21). http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm (11 of 43)8/20/2004 8:35:34 AMSmallpox Vaccination and Adverse Reactions </P> GV rash might be preceded by fever, but usually, patients do not appear ill ( Figure 22). Lesions follow the same course as the vaccination site. Lesions can be present anywhere on the body, including the palms and soles and can be numerous or limited. GV can appear as a regional form that is characterized by extensive satellite vesiculation around the vaccination site, or as an eruption localized to a body part (e.g., arm or leg), with no evidence of inadvertent inoculation (4) ( Figure 23). A mild form of GV also exists, which appears with only a limited number of scattered lesions. The skin lesions of GV are believed to be spread by the hematogenous route (1) and might contain vaccinia virus. Therefore, contact precautions should be used when treating these patients. Patients should be instructed to keep lesions covered and avoid physical contact with others if their lesions are too numerous to cover with bandages or clothing. The differential diagnosis of GV includes EM, EV, inadvertent inoculation at multiple sites, and uncommonly, early stages of PV or other vesicular diseases (e.g., disseminated herpes or severe chickenpox). GV is self-limited among immunocompetent hosts. These patients appear well and do not require VIG, but might benefit from simple supportive care measures (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents [NSAIDS] and oral antipruritics). VIG might be beneficial in the rare case where an immunocompetent person appears systemically ill. GV is often more severe among persons with an underlying immunodeficiency, and these patients might benefit from early intervention with VIG. EV EV is a localized or generalized papular, vesicular, or pustular rash, which can occur anywhere on the body, with a predilection for areas of previous atopic dermatitis lesions. Persons with a history of atopic dermatitis are at highest risk for EV. Onset of the characteristic lesions can be noted either concurrently with or shortly after the development of the local vaccinial lesions (1). EV cases resulting from secondary transmission usually appeared with skin eruptions approximately 5--19 days after the suspected exposure (1,17) ( Figures 24 and 25). EV lesions follow the same dermatological course as the vaccination site in a vaccinee, and confluent lesions can occur ( Figure 26). The rash is often accompanied by fever and lymphadenopathy, and affected persons are systemically ill (43). EV tends to be more severe among first-time vaccinees or unvaccinated contacts (12,44) ( Figure 27). Atopic dermatitis, regardless of disease severity or activity, is a risk factor for experiencing EV among either vaccinees or their close contacts (21,22,44--46), but no data exist to predict the absolute risk for these persons. The majority of primary-care providers do not distinguish between eczema and atopic dermatitis when describing chronic exfoliative skin conditions, including among infants and young children (47,48). Animal studies demonstrate that an immunologic T-cell dysregulation predisposes affected progressive papular, vesicular, and pustular lesions, even in intact skin (47). EV can be associated with systemic illness that includes fever and malaise. Management includes hemodynamic support (e. g., as for sepsis) and meticulous skin care (e.g., as for burn victims). Patients might require volume repletion and vigilant monitoring of electrolytes as a result of disruption of the dermal barrier. Patients with EV are at risk for secondary bacterial and fungal infections of the lesions, and antibacterials and antifungals are indicated as necessary. One study determined that the mortality from EV was reduced from 30%--40% to 7% after the introduction of VIG (41). Therefore, establishing the diagnosis early not delaying treatment with VIG is imperative to reducing mortality. Patients are usually severely ill and can require multiple doses of VIG. Virus can be isolated from EV lesions, making these patients highly infectious. Infection-control precautions should be used to prevent secondary transmission and nosocomial infection (17). PV PV (also referred to vaccinia gangrenosa, prolonged vaccinia, and disseminated vaccinia), is a rare, severe, and often lethal complication that occurs among persons with immunodeficiencies (43, 49--51). This diagnosis should be suspected if the initial vaccination lesion continues to progress without apparent healing >15 days after smallpox http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm (12 of 43)8/20/2004 8:35:34 AMSmallpox Vaccination and Adverse Reactions </P> vaccination (8). Anecdotal experience suggests that, despite treatment with VIG, persons with cell-mediated immune deficits have a poorer prognosis than those with humoral deficits (1). PV is characterized by painless progressive necrosis at the vaccination site with or without metastases to distant sites (e.g., skin, bones, and other viscera) (50) ( Figure 28). The vaccination lesion does not heal, presumably secondary to an immune derangement, and progresses to an ulcerative lesion, often with central necrosis (9) ( Figure 29). Initially, limited or no inflammation appears at the site, and histopathology can reveal absence of inflammatory cells in the dermis (52). During the weeks that follow, patients might experience bacterial infection and signs of inflammation (J. Michael Lane, M.D., formerly Director, Smallpox Eradication Program, Communicable Disease Center, personal communication, 2002). In a 1963 study, the majority of 66 cases initially reported to be PV were reclassified after follow-up as severe primary (i.e., major) reactions (22). Cases of severe major reactions cleared within 1--2 weeks without VIG treatment ( Figures 30 and 31). With PV, vaccinia virus continues to spread locally and can metastasize to distant sites through viremia ( Figure 32). Live vaccinia virus can be isolated from the skin lesions of these patients. Infection-control precautions, which include contact isolation, are required to avoid vaccinial infection of other persons and to limit risk for secondary infections. The differential diagnosis of PV includes severe bacterial infection, severe chickenpox, other necrotic conditions (e.g., gangrene), and disseminated herpes simplex infections. Persons at highest risk for PV include those with congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies, HIV/AIDS, cancer, and those on immunosuppressive therapies for organ transplantation or autoimmune disease. The degree and type of immunocompromise probably correlates with the risk for PV, although the protective level of cellular count or humoral immunity is unknown. Before the introduction of VIG and early antiviral medications, PV was universally fatal (23); but after VIG was used for PV treatment, the survival rate improved (9,13). Surgical debridement was used infrequently with variable success to treat the primary progressive necrotic lesions of PV (V. Fulginiti, M.D., Universities of Arizona and Colorado, personal communication, 2002). Management of PV should include aggressive therapy with VIG, intensive monitoring, and tertiary-level supportive care. Despite advances in medical care, PV probably will continue to be associated with a high mortality rate. Postvaccinial Central Nervous System Disease Central nervous system (CNS) disease after smallpox vaccination is most common among infants aged <12 months and is a diagnosis of exclusion (12). Clinical symptoms reflect cerebral or cerebellar dysfunction with headache, fever, vomiting, altered mental status, lethargy, seizures, and coma (43). CNS lesions occur in the cerebrum, medulla, and spinal cord. Lumbar puncture can reveal an increased opening cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) pressure, and examination of CSF might indicate monocytosis, lymphocytosis, and elevated CSF protein (1,12,43). Both PVE and PVEM have been described (1). PVE typically affects infants aged <2 years and reflects cerebral damage as a result of vascular changes. Acute onset of symptoms occurs 6--10 days postvaccination and can include seizures, hemiplegia, aphasia, and transient amnesia. Associated histopathological changes include generalized cerebral edema, mild lymphocytic menigineal infiltration, widespread ganglion degenerative changes, and occasionally, perivascular hemorrhages. Patients can be left with cerebral impairment and hemiplegia (1). PVEM (or encephalitis) affects persons aged >2 years and includes abrupt onset of fever, vomiting, headache, malaise, and anorexia approximately 11--15 days after vaccination. Symptoms can progress to loss of consciousness, amnesia, confusion, disorientation, restlessness, delirium, drowsiness, seizures, and coma or urinary retention, obstinate constipation, and sometimes menigismus. CSF, although under increased pressure, reveals normal chemistries and cell count. Histopathological features include perivenous demyelination and microglial proliferation in demyelinated areas with lymphocytic infiltration but limited cerebral edema. These pathological features are similar to what is observed in other postinfectious encephalitides (1,53). http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm (13 of 43)8/20/2004 8:35:34 Adverse Reactions </P> The strain of vaccinia virus used in smallpox vaccines might influence the frequency of PVE and PVEM (1). Reports based on European data indicate generally higher rates of PVE among persons vaccinated with non-NYCBOH strains (53). In the United States, where the principal strain used was the NYCBOH, the occurrence of PVE or PVEM was rare among first-time vaccinees (1,9,12). Unrelated diseases that cause encephalomyelitis or encephalopathy might be temporally related to smallpox vaccination (1). U.S. rates might include these unrelated events, artificially increasing the rates of PVE/PVEM (1,9). The pathophysiology of PVE/PVEM is not well understood, although an autoimmune process has been hypothesized (53,54). Vaccinia virus has been isolated from CSF and CNS tissue of affected persons (12,53,55). The significance of this finding is unknown in the absence of controlled trials that examine CSF of healthy vaccinees. No clinical criteria, radiographic findings, or laboratory tests are specific for the diagnosis of PVE. PVE/PVEM are diagnoses of exclusion, and other infectious or toxic etiologies should be considered before making these diagnoses. In the past, recipients of the NYCBOH strain who experienced PVE or PVEM had a 15%--25% mortality rate, and 25% of survivors were left with varying neurological deficits (12). No study has indicated that VIG can be an effective therapy for PVE or PVEM, and therefore, VIG is not recommended for treatment of PVE or PVEM. A prospective study of prophylactic use of VIG among Dutch army recruits demonstrated reduced incidence of PVE among persons vaccinated with a non-NYCBOH strain (56). This led to routine administration of VIG in first-time vaccinations of adults in the Netherlands (57). However, the incidence of PVE after smallpox vaccination with the NYCBOH strain is low (9); therefore, concomitant administration of VIG at time of vaccination has never been recommended with the NYCBOH strain. No specific therapy exists for PVE or PVEM; however, supportive care, anticonvulsants, and intensive care might be required. Because the clinical symptoms of PVE or PVEM are not believed to be a result of replicating vaccinia virus, the role of antivirals is unclear. Fetal Vaccinia Fetal vaccinia, resulting from vaccinial transmission from mother to fetus, is a rare, but serious, complication of smallpox vaccination during pregnancy or shortly before conception; <50 cases have been reported in the literature (58--60). Fetal vaccinia is manifested by skin lesions and organ involvement, and often results in fetal or neonatal death (61). The skin lesions in the newborn infant are similar to those of GV or PV and can be confluent and extensive ( Figures 33 and 34). The number of affected pregnancies maintained until term is limited. Affected pregnancies have been reported among women vaccinated in all three trimesters, among first-time vaccinees as well as in those being revaccinated, and among nonvaccinated contacts of vaccinees (18,19). Because fetal vaccinia is so rare, the frequency of, and risks for, fetal vaccinia cannot be reliably determined. Whether virus infects the fetus through blood or by direct contact with infected amniotic fluid is unknown. No known reliable intrauterine diagnostic test is available to confirm fetal infection. Apart from the characteristic pattern of fetal vaccinia, smallpox vaccination of pregnant women has not been clearly associated with prematurity, low birth weight, and fetal loss. In addition, smallpox vaccine has not been demonstrated to cause congenital malformations (62--64). VIG might be considered for a viable infant born with lesions, although no data exist for determining the appropriate dosage or estimating efficacy. If a pregnant woman is inadvertently vaccinated or if she becomes pregnant within 4 weeks after vaccinia vaccination, she should be counseled regarding the basis of concern for the fetus. However, given the rarity of congenital vaccinia among live-born infants, vaccination during pregnancy should not ordinarily be a reason to consider termination of pregnancy. No indication exists for routine, prophylactic use of VIG for an unintentionally vaccinated pregnant woman; however, VIG should not be withheld if a pregnant woman experiences a condition where VIG is needed (e.g., EV). To expand understanding of the risk for fetal vaccinia and to document whether adverse pregnancy outcome http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm (14 of 43)8/20/2004 8:35:34 AMSmallpox Vaccination and Adverse Reactions </P> might be associated with vaccination, CDC is establishing a prospective smallpox vaccination pregnancy registry (see Requests for Clinical Consultation and IND Therapies and for Registries Enrollment). Other Vaccine-Specific Adverse Events Less frequently reported adverse events temporally associated with after smallpox vaccination include myocarditis, pericarditis (65--70), precipitation of erythema nodosum leprosum or neuritis among leprosy patients (1), and osteomyelitis (sometimes confirmed by recovery of vaccinia virus) (1,71). Reported skin changes at the vaccination scar have included malignant tumors (e.g., melanoma [8], discoid lupus [72], and localized myxedema as a symptom of Graves disease [73]). Reported neurologic complications after smallpox vaccination include transverse myelitis, seizures, paralysis, polyneuritis, and brachial neuritis (53,74). Whether these conditions are caused by smallpox vaccination or represent coincidental occurrences after vaccination is unclear. Temporal association alone does not prove causation (75). Other unknown adverse events after smallpox vaccination might yet be described. Determining causality of reported postvaccination events associated with a specific vaccine is challenging and requires careful weighing of all the scientific evidence, evaluation of the quality and consistency of the data, and consideration of biologic plausibility of the association between the vaccination and the event ( Box 1) (76). Clinicians should report unexpected and clinically relevant adverse events after vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and follow local, state, and territorial reporting requirements (see Smallpox Adverse Event Reporting). Revaccination of Persons with History of Adverse Events Before the eradication of smallpox, clinicians were often faced with the decision of whether to revaccinate persons who had documented serious adverse reactions. One study recommended that persons with a history of postvaccinial CNS disease (e.g., PVE/PVEM) or PV should not be revaccinated. Revaccination of children who had EV was not contraindicated, although it was recommended that they receive VIG concomitantly. Revaccination of children with a history of inadvertent inoculation or erythematous or urticarial rashes presented no known or theoretical risk (8). Persons with a history of an adverse reaction to smallpox vaccination that leads to deferral should not knowingly be placed in a situation where they might be exposed to smallpox. No absolute contraindications exist regarding vaccination of persons with high-risk exposures to smallpox; persons at greatest risk for experiencing serious vaccination complications are also at greatest risk for death from smallpox. In this situation, the benefits of smallpox vaccination probably outweigh the risks for an adverse reaction from smallpox vaccine ( 6). Prophylaxis for Persons at High Risk Inadvertently Exposed to Vaccinia Virus Either Through Vaccination or Contact Transmission Historically, VIG was administered prophylactically to persons at increased risk for vaccine-related adverse events who required vaccination or who were inadvertently vaccinated (8). However, VIG administration is not without risk, and the efficacy of VIG as a prophylactic against vaccinial infection has not been studied in a controlled setting. Until VIG is evaluated for such use, VIG is not recommended for prophylaxis when persons with contraindications to smallpox vaccination are inadvertently exposed to vaccinia and are otherwise well. Such persons should have careful clinical follow-up to ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment of an adverse event, if one occurs. Furthermore, in the absence of circulating smallpox virus, VIG is not recommended for concomitant use with smallpox vaccination among persons with contraindications. As recommended by ACIP, careful screening criteria should be used to exclude persons with contraindications from preoutbreak smallpox vaccination programs (21). To better understand the risks for vaccinia exposure among persons with contraindications to smallpox vaccination, CDC plans to maintain a registry of inadvertent exposures among groups at high risk (e.g., vaccinee or contact with dermatologic http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm (15 of 43)8/20/2004 8:35:34 AMSmallpox Vaccination and Adverse Reactions </P> or pregnancy contradications). Clinicians are encouraged to report these cases to CDC so that prompt treatment can be initiated when necessary, and patients can be followed by using a standardized protocol. These data will be used to assess risk for experiencing an adverse event and the potential role for prophylactic therapy among these patients (see Requests for Clinical Consultation and IND Therapies and for Registries Enrollment). Laboratory Diagnostics Clinical evaluation and a careful patient history of recent smallpox vaccination or contact with a recent vaccinee are the mainstays of diagnosis of smallpox vaccine-related adverse events. In situations where clinical diagnosis is not straightforward, laboratory diagnostics for vaccinia might be helpful and might prevent inappropriate use of potentially toxic therapies. However, diagnostics for conditions easily confused with vaccinia infection (i.e., varicella, herpes zoster, herpes simplex, and enteroviruses), should be considered first, in particular for a nonvaccinee or someone believed to be a noncontact of a vaccinee. Serologic testing for vaccinia is probably uninformative because it cannot be used to distinguish vaccinia immunity from vaccinia infection unless baseline antibody titers are available. Diagnostic tests for vaccinia include electron microscopy to identify presence of orthopoxvirus, and gene amplification (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]), and viral culture for vaccinia. Regarding vaccinia, these tests are available only for research purposes, but are undergoing multicenter validation studies that might enable FDA to approve the test reagents for diagnostic use. After that approval, testing will be made available through the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) ( 77), an extensive system of public health and private laboratories that can be accessed through consultation with state and local health departments. Consultation regarding appropriate use of specialized vaccinia laboratory testing will be available through CDC. Laboratory Specimen Collection A suspected case of an adverse event after smallpox vaccination should be promptly reported to the appropriate local, state, or territorial health department. When appropriate, public health officials might recommend that clinical specimens be collected for further evaluation of a possible case. Specimen collection guidelines are available at http://www.bt.cdc.gov/ agent/smallpox/vaccination/vaccinia-specimen-collection.asp. Treatments VIG, cidofovir, and topical ophthalmic antiviral drugs are among the therapies that can be used to treat adverse events after smallpox vaccination. Ophthalmic drugs are discussed elsewhere in this report (see Ocular Vaccinial Infections and Therapy). VIG VIG is a sterile solution of the immunoglobulin fraction of plasma, containing antibodies to vaccinia virus from persons who were vaccinated with smallpox vaccine. The available preparation of VIG is a previously licensed IM product (VIGIM) (produced by Baxter Healthcare Corporation in 1994) containing 0.01% thimerosal (a mercury derivative) as a preservative. Two new IV preparations (VIGIV) are in production and do not contain thimerosal. All preparations of VIG will be available as IND products through CDC and DoD. VIG has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of smallpox vaccine adverse reactions that are secondary to continued vaccinia virus replication after vaccination (41,78). Such adverse reactions include EV, PV, or vaccinia necrosum, and severe cases of GV. VIG has no proven effectiveness for postvaccinia central nervous system disease. VIG is recommended for treating EV and PV. Because the majority of cases of GV are self-limited, VIG is recommended for treating GV only if the patient is seriously ill or has serious underlying disease that is a risk factor for a complication of vaccination (e.g., such immunocompromised conditions as HIV/AIDS). VIG can also be useful ocular vaccinia http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm (16 of 43)8/20/2004 8:35:34 AMSmallpox Vaccination and Adverse Reactions </P> that results from inadvertent implantation. When ocular vaccinia with keratitis is present, consideration of VIG should include the possible increased risk for corneal scarring (see Ocular Vaccinia Infections and Therapy) ( Box 2). Side Effects VIG administration has been associated with mild, moderate, and severe adverse reactions. Mild adverse reactions include local pain and tenderness, swelling, and erythema at the injection site after IM administration of immunoglobulins and can persist from hours to 1--2 days after administration. Moderate adverse reactions include joint pain, diarrhea, dizziness, hyperkinesis, drowsiness, pruritis, rash, perspiration, and vasodilation. Back and abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting can occur within the first 10 minutes of injection. Chills, fever, headache, myalgia, and fatigue can begin at the end of infusion and continue for hours. More severe reactions of this type might require pretreatment with corticosteroids or acetaminophen, if another dose of VIG is required. Serious adverse events associated with administration of VIGIV are expected to be similar to those observed with other intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) products, and can include hypotension, anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid systemic reactions, renal dysfunction, and aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS). When AMS occurs, it usually begins from within hours to 2 days after treatment and can occur more frequently in association with high dosage (2 g/kg body weight) therapy. It is characterized by severe headache, nuchal rigidity, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, painful eye movements, nausea, and vomiting. Discontinuation of IVIG treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within days without sequelae. Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid systemic reactions have been reported after IM or IV injection of human immunoglobulin preparations. The symptoms of classic anaphylactic reactions include flushing, facial swelling, dyspnea, cyanosis, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, malaise, hypotension, loss of consciousness, and in certain cases, death. Symptoms appear from within seconds to hours after infusion. The treatment of such reactions is immediate discontinuation of immune globulin and administration of epinephrine, oxygen, antihistamines, IV steroids, and cardiorespiratory support. When proteins prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the potential for transmission of infectious agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to infectious agents that might not have been discovered or characterized when the current preparations of VIG were formulated. To reduce the risk of transmitting infectious agents, stringent controls are applied in the selection of blood and plasma donors, and prescribed standards are used at plasma-collection centers, testing laboratories, and fractionation facilities. VIG Risks and Contraindications Contraindications to VIG administration include an acute allergic reaction to thimerosal (for VIGIM) or a history of a severe reaction after administration of human immunoglobulin preparations. Persons with selective immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency might have antibodies to IgA and could have anaphylactic reactions to subsequent administration of blood products that contain IgA. In a rabbit model of vaccinia keratitis, substantial doses of VIG were associated with corneal scarring (34) (see Ocular Vaccinia Infections and Therapy). Whether VIG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or if it affects reproductive capacity is unknown. Although clinical experience with other preparations containing immunoglobulins indicates that no fetal adverse events result from immunoglobulins, no studies have evaluated the adverse effects of VIG on the fetus. VIG should be administered to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Similarly, whether VIG is excreted in breast milk is unknown; therefore, caution should be exercised when VIG is administered to a nursing woman. VIG is made from human plasma; therefore, a possible risk of transmission of viruses and a theoretical risk of transmission- adventitious agents that can cause Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease exist. The risk that these products contain infectious agents has been reduced by questioning plasma donors about risk factors for infection and by testing for the presence of certain viruses in the plasma. Furthermore, manufacturing processes have been validated for their ability to inactivate and remove viruses. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm (17 of 43)8/20/2004 8:35:34 AMSmallpox Vaccination and Adverse Reactions </P> Administration Detailed instructions regarding the administration of IM and IV VIG are included in the Investigator's Brochure portion of the IND materials that accompany the products. For treatment of vaccinial complications, the recommended dose of VIGIM (16.5% solution) is 0.6 mL/kg body weight (100 mg/kg body weight). VIGIM is to be administered intramuscularly, preferably in the buttock or the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. To reduce local pain and discomfort, dividing the dose into smaller volumes to be administered by multiple injections might be necessary (79). Because the concentration of the new VIGIV products differs from that of the IM preparation, clinicians should refer to the manufacturer's package insert, or IND protocol, for correct dosages. The dose for IV administration of VIG might range from 100 mg/kg body weight to 500 mg/kg body weight, depending on the VIGIV formulation. Cidofovir Cidofovir (Vistide, \u00ae Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California), a nucleotide analogue of cytosine, has demonstrated antiviral activity against certain orthopoxviruses in cell-based in vitro and animal model studies (80--82). Its effectiveness in the treatment of vaccinia-related complications among humans is unknown. Cidofovir has been demonstrated to be nephrotoxic among humans and carcinogenic among animals, even at low doses (Gilead Sciences. Cidofovir [Package insert]. Foster City, CA: Gilead Sciences, Inc; 2000). It is administered with probenecid and hydration. Cidofovir is approved by FDA for treating CMV retinitis among patients with AIDS. Its use for treating smallpox vaccination complications is recommended only under IND protocol sponsored by CDC. This IND is a research protocol to evaluate the clinical effect and outcomes of cidofovir as a secondary treatment of vaccinia-related complications that do not respond to VIG treatment. CDC will supply cidofovir at no cost for use under this IND protocol. Cidofovir will be released for civilian use by CDC and for military use by DoD, if 1) a patient fails to respond to VIG treatment; 2) a patient is near death; or 3) all inventories of VIG have been exhausted. This proposed use of cidofovir is investigational and has not been studied among humans; therefore, the benefit of cidofovir therapy for vaccinia-related complications is uncertain. Insufficient information exists to determine the appropriate dosing and accompanying hydration and dosing of probenecid if antiviral therapy is needed to treat smallpox vaccine-related adverse events among the pediatric age group. Dosages for these patients should be determined in consultation with specialists at CDC and DoD. Additional information regarding dosing and administration of cidofovir is included in the Investigator's Brochure that accompanies the release of this product to the clinician when cidofovir is used under the IND protocol. Side Effects The major complication of cidofovir therapy is renal toxicity, which is sometimes irreversible, results in renal failure, and requires dialysis to prevent death. To reduce the renal toxicity of cidofovir, it must be administered with careful IV hydration and with probenecid, a renal tubular blocking agent. Cidofovir has also been associated with neutropenia, reported in animal studies. Mammary adenocarcinomas developed in rats exposed to 0.04 times the human exposure at the dose used in clinical practice on the basis of area-under-the-curve comparisons (Gilead Sciences, Inc. Cidofovir [Package insert]. Foster City, CA: Gilead Sciences, Inc; 2000). Probenecid has been associated with headache, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, urinary frequency, hypersensitivity reactions, anemia, hemolytic anemia, nephritic syndrome, hepatic necrosis, gout, uric acid stones, and renal colic. Probenecid should be used with caution among children, pregnant women and persons with sulfa drug allergy (see manufacturer's package insert). Administration http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm (18 of 43)8/20/2004 8:35:34 AMSmallpox Vaccination and Adverse Reactions </P> Details for administration of cidofovir are included with the medication and IND materials that are shipped by CDC. The proposed dose of cidofovir for treatment of vaccinia complications is 5 mg/kg body weight administered intravenously, one time, during a 60-minute period. A second dose 1 week later should be considered if no response occurs to the first dose. Dose adjustment might be needed to compensate for decreased excretion caused by renal dysfunction if a second dose is needed. Administration procedures include assessment of renal function and use of saline hydration, and probenecid, before and after cidofovir, according to the regimen specified in the IND protocol (and in the package insert for treatment of CMV retinitis). Patients who receive cidofovir should be followed closely, both for drug toxicities and for the outcome of their serious adverse reaction. IND protocols require viral cultures to monitor for emerging viral resistance to cidofovir. The protocol materials will be supplied to facilitate monitoring and information collection. Long-term follow-up is required under the IND protocol to monitor for carcinogenicity, renal insufficiency, and teratogenicity. Requests for Clinical Consultation and IND Therapies and for Registries Enrollment In October 2002, ACIP recommended that enhanced terrorism preparedness should include vaccination of smallpox public health response and health-care teams (21). Implementation of this vaccination program was determined to be the responsibility of the states and territories in conjunction with local predesignated hospitals. Before participation in the vaccination program, states and territories should establish a comprehensive program to manage vaccinees and their contacts who experience an adverse event after smallpox vaccination. Hospitals that participate should assign physicians with expertise in infectious diseases, neurology, dermatology, allergy/immunology, and ophthalmology to assess and manage adverse events among vaccinees and their contacts. Vaccinees and their affected contacts should have access to evaluation and medical care for a suspected adverse event 24 hours/day and 7 days/week. CDC will provide consultation to state and territorial public health officials, their surrogate providers, and other requesting physicians regarding recognition, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of adverse events after smallpox vaccination through an information line for clinicians that will be staffed 24 hours/day, 7 days/week. In addition, CDC will provide consultation for evaluation and care of persons with contraindications to smallpox vaccination that have an inadvertent exposure to vaccinia virus (e.g., vaccination of a pregnant woman or a person with atopic dermatitis). These persons also will be enrolled in a vaccination registry for prospective follow-up. Referring providers should complete a thorough vaccination history and physical examination on all patients with a suspected adverse event before accessing CDC's Clinician Information Line. In addition, high-resolution digital photographs of dermatological manifestations of adverse events can aid in the recognition of specific dermatological manifestations of adverse events and should be obtained with the patient's permission and forwarded whenever possible. Providers seeking assistance should first contact their state health department before accessing the CDC consultation service or requesting VIG or cidofovir ( Box 3). To aid providers in discerning the presence or severity of vaccine-related complications, CDC has developed draft clinical evaluation tools to assist with expected adverse events. These clinical evaluation tools are available at http://www.bt.cdc. gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/clineval; this website will be updated as additional information becomes available. Feedback regarding the utility of these clinical evaluation tools is requested and can be submitted by e-mail to spoxtool@cdc.gov. In addition, CDC and other U.S. Department of Health and Human Services agencies will collect data related to the frequency of smallpox vaccine adverse events and the clinical outcome of affected persons. These data will provide an update concerning the medical risks associated with smallpox vaccination and the efficacy and safety of INDs used in the treatment of adverse events. Smallpox Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Providers are strongly encouraged to report serious adverse events to VAERS after the administration of the smallpox vaccine ( Box 4). VAERS is a passive reporting system for safety monitoring of all vaccines licensed in the United States, and is jointly managed by CDC and FDA. CDC and FDA will monitor smallpox vaccine-related adverse event reports daily, and will provide enhanced surveillance of adverse events after administration of the smallpox vaccine. However, adverse events that are judged to be serious or unexpected and which require CDC consultation or IND therapies (VIG or http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm (19 of 43)8/20/2004 8:35:34 AMSmallpox Vaccination and Adverse Reactions </P> cidofovir) should not be solely reported to VAERS. These cases should instead be immediately reported by phone to the appropriate state health department officials and CDC, who will assist the reporting provider with completion of a VAERS form. All other smallpox vaccine adverse events that are serious, but do not require CDC consultation or administration of IND therapies, should be reported directly to VAERS within 48 hours of recognition. All other adverse events should be directly reported to VAERS within 1 week ( Box 4). Additional Information CDC, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has developed a website, which is available at http://www.bt.cdc.gov/training/smallpoxvaccine/reactions. Information and photographs related to smallpox vaccination, normal vaccination reactions, adverse events after vaccination, and treatments for adverse reactions can be located at this website.

Adverse reactions have been demonstrated to be caused by the vaccination. Adverse reactions also are referred to as vaccine side effects or complications. In contrast, adverse events are untoward effects observed or reported after vaccinations, but a causal relation between the two have yet to be established. Therefore, adverse events include both 1) adverse reactions and 2) other events associated with vaccinations only by coincidence (i.e., they would have occurred also in the absence of vaccination). This report focuses on adverse reactions known to be caused by smallpox vaccine on the basis of extensive prior experience. Additional previously unknown adverse events might be reported with reintroduction of smallpox vaccinations; however, whether they are causally related will require additional evaluation.

B. Introduction: Variola virus is a m ember of the genus Orthopoxvirus within the f amily Poxviridae. are loped viruses DNA genom e. Of the four orthopoxvi ruses known to infect hum ans, variola virus (m ajor and minor) produces the m ost significan t clinical disease (sm allpox). C. Transm itted routinely person-to-p erson (a form of direct contact) v ia inhalation of variola virus pr esent in droplets generated fr the resp iratory tract transm ission is via dire ct contact, infection contro l and prevention m easures are based primarily on contact and d roplet precautions.1 Historically, secondary transm ission of infecti on has been limited to susceptible contacts in the imm ediate vicinity of pa tients . Patien ts become infectious at onset of their rash. Lesions develop prim arily on the skin soon afte r onset and eventually form scabs that can slough off. Viable viruses can be present in these scabs, and the protein m aterial of the scab can protect the viruses from desiccati on. Poxviruses shed dur ing the course of infection therefore tend to be more resistan t to the effects of drying com pared to other enveloped v iruses (e.g., influenza viruses, rubella virus). Pox viruses (e.g., vaccin ia virus, variola virus) are tightly bound with the fibrin matrices of the scab, however, and this limits the efficien cy of virus transfer from environm ent to persons via reaerosolization.2 There are lim ited reports of airborne spread of variola virus in h ealth care facilities an d laboratories3, 4 and reaero solized trans mission from fabric or bedding fomites.5, 6 The mechanis ms of virus spread as describe d in these reports, however, m ay represent potentially important ex ception s to the usual mode of trans mission. Addition al factors present in these situations (e.g., enhanced efficiency of viral shedding from oral and pharyngeal lesions, poorly engineered facility ventilation) may have contributed to and facilitated viral dispersion in ways that might not be consistently duplicated in contem porary health care facilities.3 Guide F - Environm ental Control Page 2 of 10 Smallpox Response Plan March 20, 2003 A properly engineered heating, ventilat ion, and air-condition (HVAC) sys tem can minimize the possibility of airborne spread of variola virus in f acilities providing care for smallpox patien ts. Placing sm allpox patien ts in airborne infection isolation (AII) roo ms (i.e., room s under negative air pressure relative to the corridor or other adjacent space) can help to lim it distribution of virus in the air.7 Existing AII room s in healthcare facilities need not be m odified beyond the current engineering specificatio ns.8 A m ore in- depth discussion of variola virus transm ission can be found in Guide A\u2014Sm allpox Surveillance and Case Reporting; Co ntact Identification, Tracing, and Surveillance ; miologic Investig ation Variola virus could hypotheti cally as a w eapon either through airborne dispersion or through intentiona lly infecting one or m ore pe rsons and encouraging them to circulate am ong groups of people, there by exposing these contac ts to variola virus infection. If introduced into th e air, it is likely that the vi rus w ould be inactivated within 24 hours, and certainly would not be presen t in the environm ent by the tim e any cases might occur 7-17 days la ter. The exp ected ou tcome resulting from this f orm of releas e would m ost likely be large num bers of cas es with clustered onsets. Establishing epidem iologic association am ong the se cases could be problem atic, depending on the site and extent of virus dispersion. If introdu ced through intentionally infected persons, the origin of the virus (i.e., the index case) a nd the extent of the out break could likely be tracked using standard epidem iologic and laboratory m ethods. D. Occupational Issues: The following activities should be lim ited preferably to pers ons with active to Guide B\u2014Vaccination Guid elines for State and Local Health Agencies part 1 , part 2 , and part 3 for inform ation on vaccination s trateg ies for workers who provide th ese services and for those not involved with thes e functions. Personal respiratory protection (i.e., N95 respirators) may be indicated fo r those workers who pr ovide d irect care to smallpox patients. W henever possible, dispos able versions of PPE should be used as appropriate and discarded after use as per routine m edical waste dispo sal practices.9 All personnel should adhere to hand hygiene prac tices as per current recommendations.10 Refer to Guide C part one\u2014Infection Control Me asures for H ealth care an d Community Settings for inform ation about the ap propriate types of PPE a nd indications for their use. E. Decontam ination and Disinfection: In general, large enveloped viruses have less intrinsic res istance to in activation by either physical or chem ical m ethods of di sinfection com pared to nonenveloped viruses Guide F - Environm ental Control Page 3 of 10 Smallpox Response Plan March 20, 2003 and m any types of bacteria or fungi. The e nvelope surrounding the core particle of a large virus (e.g., variola virus) contains lipids, and this bioc hemical property renders this and other enveloped viruses par ticularly sens itive to chem ical disinfection (Figure 1). Figure 1. Relative Resistance of Micr oorganism s to Chem ical Disinfection* l endospores Mycobacteria Non-lipid a nd small vir uses (e.g., Norwalk virus, polio virus) Fungi Vegetativ e bacteria Lipid or medium siz ed viruses (e.g., herpes sim plex virus [HSV], hepatitis B virus [HBV], hepatitis human virus [HIV], [VZV], vaccin vario la virus (Least Resistant) * Note: Modified from ref erence #11 There are no disinfectant pr oducts registered by the U.S. Environm ental Protection Agency (EPA) specifically for the in activ ation of variola virus on surfaces, nor have any products been evaluated for this purpose using this specific virus in potency testing. It has been established, however, that viruse s with biophysical and biochem ical properties similar to th ose of variola virus (i.e., vacci nia virus) are read ily inactivated by a variety of active ingredients found in EPA-registered chem ical germicides th at provide low- or intermediate -leve l disinfection during general use (Table 1).12, 13 If a m anufacturer has subm itted data to EPA s howing that the product inactiv ates v accin ia virus , and the EP A has accep ted those data and approved such a cl aim (as it has for a num ber of products), then the product's label would bear s pecific use d irections for killing vaccinia virus on environm ental surfaces. The em piric pres umption is that such products would be expected to have sufficient potency to inactivate variola virus on nonporous surfaces.

It is also expected that high-level disinfectants or liquid chem ical sterilants cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Adm inistration (F DA) for the purpose of achieving high-level disinfection of sem i- critical ins truments and devices will be effective at inactiv ating vaccin ia virus and variola viruses. All sterilization methods currently cleared by F DA for m edical instrum ents and devices will also in activate these viru ses. Use of high-level disinfectants or liquid chem ical sterilants on large environm ental su rfaces (e.g., table tops, floors, walls) is not indicated under any circum stances. F. Environm ental Infection Control of Sm allpox: When developing a strategy for the environm ental control of variola virus, the following elem ents should be included: 1. Control m easures to reduce viral contam ination on fabrics, clothing, and bedding, 2. Cleaning and disinfection of reusable equipm ent, 3. Cleaning and appropriate reproces sing of m edical instrum ents, 4. Cleaning and decontam ination of surfaces, 5. Regulated m edical waste containm ent, treatm ent, and disposal, and 6. Indications (if any) for decontam ination of air sp ace in room s or vehicles. Guide F - Environm ental Control Page 5 of 10 Smallpox Response Plan March 20, 2003 1. Laundry: Textiles and Bedding : Textiles and fabrics (e.g., pr otective clothing, bed linens, clothing) from patients and their imm ediate contacts should be ha ndled with m inimum agitation to avoid contam ination of air, surfaces, and p ersons.15 This prevents th e dispersion of potentially contam inated sloughed-off scabs and skin squa mes into the air. Textiles and clothing should be bagged or contained at the point of use in acco rdance with Occu pational Safety and Health Adm inistrati on (OSHA) regulations.9 These item s should not be sorted prior to laundering. Most, if not al l form s of containment used for routine healthcare laundry are acceptable for containing textiles and fa brics generated in care areas f or smallpox patients. Wet textiles should be bagged first and then placed in a le ak-proof container. Reusable fabric laundry bags comm only us ed for laundry transport can be laundered along with the clothing and othe r fabrics. The use of a water-soluble bag is another option for minim izing direct c ontact and m anipulation of thes e fabrics and clothing prior to washing. If laundry is transported to an off-site facility, the procedures that are curren tly us ed for transp orting and s afe handlin g of contam inated textiles of f-site will be adequate for these situations. Laundry should be labeled in such a way that laundry staff should be prom pted to wear appropriate PPE and handle potentially contam inated laundry with a m inimum of agitation.9 The laundry area in a health care facility that receives potentially contam inated textiles and clothing should be set at ne gative air pressure as per norm al operating standards, and be physically separate from the area where clean laundry is dried, folded, and packed for transport and distribution.8 Textiles and fabrics from care areas for smallpox patients can be laundered using routine protocols for healthcare fa cilities (i.e., hot water [71\u00baC or 160 \u00b0F] washing with deterg ent an d bleach and hot air drying).7, 11 No special laundering protocols are needed, nor is it n ecessary to launder m aterial s from smallpox care areas separately fro m laundry generated elsewhere in the facility. If contam inated clothing and bed linens are to be washed at hom e, use the hot water cy cle at the highest tem perature possible with detergent followed by hot air drying. The use of chlorine bleach during hot-water washing can provide add itional measure f or safety. The use of cold wate r washing ha s not been evaluated with respect to inactivation of variola virus. If no other wash cycles other than cold water are available, use detergents and laundry additives that a re specifically for mulated for cold-water wash ing and dry using a hot air cycle for the dryer.7 2. Reusable Medical Equipment: The surfaces of reusable m edical equipm ent should be cleaned and then subjected to eithe r low- o r interm ediate- level d isinfection an EPA-registered chem Curre nt protocols and proce dures for cleaning and disinfection need not be changed.7, 11 Guide F - Environm ental Control Page 6 of 10 Smallpox Response Plan March 20, 2003 3. Medical Instruments: Disposable m edical instrum ents and patie nt-care devices should be placed in containm ent for safe handling and discarded as per state regulations for the routine handling of m edical waste. All reusable m edical instrum ents should be cleaned after use as per standard protocols. These instrum ents should then be either sterilized or subjected to high-level disinfection depending on th eir intended use as per the Spaulding class ificatio n.11 There is no need to presoak th e instrum ents unless th e instrum ents cannot be cleaned and reproce ssed immediately after use. In this situation, water or saline with or without detergents are adequate soaking agents. 4. Environmental Surfaces: Environm ental su rfaces that are touched frequently by hand c an be cleaned and subjec ted to low- to in termediate-lev el disinfection with EPA-regis tered chem ical germ icides a ccording to label instructions.7 Large housekeepin g surfaces such as floors and tabletop s can be cleaned using an EPA-re gistered detergent disinfecta nt acco rding no evidence for transm ission of variola virus from nonporous surfaces. Th erefore, th ere is no ind ication to use extrao rdinary procedures to clean and d isinfect th e interior surfaces of am bulances or other spaces occupied by smallpox patients. Routine approaches for cleaning and disinfecti on are adequate in these areas. Current procedures and schedules can be used for m anage ment of floors and furniture.7 Use a vacuum cleaner equipped with a high efficien cy particulate air (HEPA) filter for cleaning carpeted floors or upholster ed furniture. Disinfection of the vacuum cleane r is no t requ ired w hen a HEPA f ilter is properly insta lled and rem ains intact du ring use. Full vacuum cleaner bags can b e placed in another closable container and discarded as a routine solid waste.7 If carpets and upholstered furnitu re require cleaning to rem ove visible soil, commercially avai lable products for this purpose are acceptable for use as per usual. 5. Regulated Medical Waste: Regulated m edical waste should be place d in containm ent, subjected to a decontam ination treatm ent, and in acco rdance with m edical waste regu lation s of the state or other appropria te jurisdiction. This include s the use of offsite m edical waste tr eatm ent serv ices. However, if healthca re facilities h ave the cap ability of treating/decontam inating m edical waste onsite, this capacity s hould be the first option for medical waste m anage ment.7 All currently approved m ethods of m edical waste decontam ination can b e expected to inactiv ate po x viruses. State health departm ents or other authorities having juri sdiction should partner state enviro nmental agencies to dev elop approp riate policies and/or re gulations to ensure the safe disposal of treated regulated medical wastes. These agencies sho uld provid e Guide F - Environm ental Control Page 7 of 10 Smallpox Response Plan March 20, 2003 assuranc e to landf ill op erators that these tr eated wastes will not pose sig nificant risk of smallpox exposure to either the landfill work ers or to th e general pub lic. There is no scien tific ba sis for refusing landf ill disposal of these tr eated wastes. Many, if not all states, consid er anatom ical and patholog ical wastes as regulated medical wastes, but the rem ains of a decedent are usually excluded from this category. Incineration is one option for effectively tr eating anatom ical and patholo gical was tes prior to disposal; other treatm ent options m ay be allowed fo r this waste category as per state regulations or the regulations of the authority having jurisdiction. R emains can be safely m anaged in m ortuary settings using the current practices of barrier protection, Standard precautions, and other appropriate safety procedures during em balm ing or otherwise preparing the body for crem ation (e.g., safe handling and disposal of embalming chem icals, proper ven tilation, env ironmental surface clean-up and disinfection). The public health authority m ay choos e to exercise the power s regarding the safe disposal of hum an rem ains as outlined in Section 504 of the Model State Em ergency Health Powers Act if it is determ ined that a state of public health em ergency exists.16 6. Indications for Decontamination of Air Space in Rooms or Vehicles: There is no evidence to support air space deco ntamination of room s, facilities, or vehicles (e.g., fum igation). Therefore, fu migation is not indicat ed for environm ental control of variola viru s. In controlled laboratory di spersion studies using aerosolized vaccin ia virus, infectiou s virion s were rap idly inactiv ated in the environ ment, such that only 10% viable particles were de tectable 24 h rs after the release.17 Factors affecting the rate of viral inactivation in this study included: Temperature, Hum idity, and Exposure to ultraviolet irradia tion (i.e. a release outdoors).17 An addition al labo ratory study of variola virus aerosols under contro lled conditions has shown that increasing levels of hum idity have little ef fect on vira l ther ses.18 In this study, only 10%-30% of viable variola viruses were recovered from cont rolled aerosols after 1 hour. However, by the tim e cases appear in the community follow ing an aeros ol release, th e presum ption is that no viable virus would be remaining in the environm ent from that release. Ad dition ally, m odern HVAC system s and curren t engineer ing s pecifications for those system s provide for air cleani ng via air changes per hour (ACH).7 As stated previously, it is also unlikely that variola virus embedded in the fibrin m aterial from scabs will b e easily released from this m aterial and dispersed into the air. If the virus were able to persis t in an infectious f orm in the environm ent, then additional cases having no contact with infected persons would have been identified. This observation was noted in studies conducted during th e smallpox eradication era.19 Guide F - Environm ental Control Page 8 of 10 Smallpox Response Plan March 20, 2003 References : 1.
