However, a positive peanut 61 test result is not always associated with clinical reactivity. This practice parameter addresses the 62 diagnosis of IgE mediated peanut allergy both in children and adults as pertaining to 3 fundamental 63 questions (see text box 1). This parameter exclusively discusses IgE mediated peanut allergy and all 64 references herein pertain to IgE mediated food allergy to peanut only, and not to peanut as a potential 65 trigger in eosinophilic esophagitis or non-IgE mediated food allergy such as food protein induced 66 enterocolitis syndrome. 67 Diagnostic testing for peanut allergy is used to help make a diagnosis where there is suspicion of a 68 peanut allergy based on the clinical history.6 Failure to make a correct diagnosis can result in either 69 unnecessary avoidance in a non-allergic person, or erroneous guidance that the patient can safely ingest 70 peanut ad libitum when there is in fact an allergy\u2014situations that are both problematic. A correct 71 diagnosis facilitates peanut avoidance and counseling when the patient is at risk of potential life-72 threatening complications of peanut allergy, and therefore is advised to carry epinephrine for use in case 73 4 of symptomatic accidental ingestion. Alternatively, exclusion of peanut allergy allows peanut to be 74 incorporated into the diet without concern, eliminating the burden of precautions and fear.1 Testing is 75 also used to monitor changes in baseline peanut sensitization since diagnosis, which may decrease (or 76 increase) over time and may be associated with an increased likelihood that an allergic individual may be 77 outgrowing their peanut allergy.7,8 Although previous research in patients with established peanut 78 allergy reported clinical diagnostic cut-off points for >95% chance of reaction and for <50% chance of 79 reaction to oral food challenge, these are not necessarily predictive of clinical outcomes in all settings and 80 patients, as they are highly dependent on the baseline prevalence of peanut allergy in the particular 81 population.1, 9-11 82 The panel developed the key (PICO) questions to be addressed, and after systematic review of the 83 literature (>1300 references searched), meta-analysis of the evidence, and GRADE analysis of the results, 84 made recommendations - all of which were conditional in strength, with very low certainty of 85 evidence. Thresholds for testing were at 3mm for SPT, and 0.35 KUA/L for both whole peanut sIgE and 86 component-specific peanut sIgE, based on the most widely reported levels evaluated in the 87 literature. Extensive sensitivity analysis was performed to confirm the results. 88 The panel suggested that diagnostic testing for peanut allergy be used in patients with a high pre-test 89 probability of peanut allergy, or prior to an oral food challenge for patients with moderate pre-test 90 probability of peanut allergy, as a preference-sensitive choice, but not in patients with a low or very low 91 pre-test probability of peanut allergy. If a single diagnostic test is to be used, testing for the Ara h 2 92 component would provide the most diagnostic accuracy as determined by the more optimal 93 positive/negative likelihood ratio, provided this is available in the future as a stand-alone test and not 94 ordered as a panel with other peanut components. The literature search did not provide patient-level data 95 to determine the value of testing for peanut components in addition to skin prick test or sIgE to whole 96 peanut to increase diagnostic accuracy, including isolated Ara h 2 in that context. The clinician should 97 not use the results of a SPT, sIgE to whole peanut extract, or sIgE to peanut components to determine an 98 allergy phenotype or to predict the severity of a future reaction (e.g., is the patient \"anaphylactic\" to 99 peanut). Additional analysis of the health and economic benefits of the potential testing options showed 100 that at multiple presumed prevalence of peanut allergy in the population, compared to use of peanut-101 specific Ara h 2 testing, the use of either whole peanut extract SPT or sIgE was associated with higher 102 costs and lower health benefits (e.g. dominated analysis), making Ara h 2 the most cost-effective option 103 5 in this analysis until the specificity of Ara h 2 testing fell below 0.46. There remain important 104 knowledge gaps and needs for well-designed studies to address these questions, as well as the need for 105 patient-level data to be made available when reporting test sensitivity/specificity to enhance the ability to 106 perform future meta-analysis that can explore different cut-off levels. 107 108 Question 1: Should diagnostic testing for peanut allergy be performed in adults and children with a 109 history of suspected peanut allergy who are requesting evaluation for peanut allergy? 110 Recommendation 1a: We suggest in favor of diagnostic (skin prick or serum sIgE) testing for 111 peanut allergy in patients with a 1) physician-judged high pre-test probability of peanut allergy, or 2) 112 prior to an oral food challenge for patients with moderate pre-test probability of peanut allergy, for both 113 of whom shared decision-making has been employed to arrive at the final decision. Conditional 114 recommendation; Certainty of evidence: very low 115 Recommendation 1b: We suggest against diagnostic testing in patients where there is low or very 116 low pre-test probability of peanut allergy. Conditional recommendation; Certainty of evidence: very 117 low 118 Discussion: This question was not searched in a systematic manner as the content experts were 119 unaware of any single research study that addressed this question. The workgroup did a Pubmed literature 120 search that did not come up with any articles that address this question, which by default limits the 121 certainty of evidence. The workgroup and JTFPP felt that it would be a waste of valuable resources to 122 conduct a librarian-conducted formal literature search. However, expert evidence was collected both 123 from the content experts and the JTFPP. Expert evidence differs from expert opinion, in that the former 124 does not include a judgment on the evidence and offers a systematic and transparent appraisal of the 125 evidence.12 In their collective personal clinical experience, the guideline working group related that when 126 evaluating their collective patient experiences, that diagnostic testing could be of value to confirm peanut 127 allergy in high-risk individuals for which an oral challenge might not be advisable or agreed to by 128 patients, but also acknowledged that in a patient presenting with a classical history the diagnosis could be 129 made on the basis of history alone without further testing in some circumstances. The panel related that 130 they suggested an oral food challenge when there was a moderate probability of peanut allergy but that a 131 large proportion of their patients may prefer a diagnostic test prior to the oral food challenge. Similarly, 132 6 the collective personal experience of the panel was that diagnostic testing in patients with a low 133 probability of peanut allergy (e.g., sibling has peanut allergy and patient has never ingested peanut) 134 identified patients who were sensitized but not truly allergic. Unfortunately, many of these patients 135 refused an oral food challenge and likely avoided peanut unnecessarily. 136 These recommendations are in alignment with previous expert guidelines and practice parameters13-15 137 on food allergy diagnosis and management which provide similar consensus regarding the indications for 138 testing for the presence of food sensitization, including peanut, in evaluating a possible diagnosis of food 139 allergy. While screening of infants to foods prior to food introduction is discouraged, testing to peanut in 140 infants at high-risk for peanut allergy (under the very prescribed context of those infants with either 141 severe eczema and/or egg allergy) is now recommended prior to initial peanut introduction per the 2017 142 NIAID addendum guidelines.16 143 Question 2a: In the patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy, which of the 144 three tests\u2014SPT, sIgE to whole peanut, or Ara h2 would provide the highest diagnostic accuracy 145 as determined by the more optimal positive/negative likelihood ratio? 146 Question 2b: In a patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy, does testing for 147 peanut components in addition to either SPT or sIgE to whole peanut increase the diagnostic 148 accuracy? 149 150 151 Recommendation 2a: We suggest in favor of Ara h2 diagnostic testing (over SPT or sIgE to whole peanut) in a patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy for which a single diagnostic test is to be used, as Ara h2 would provide the best diagnostic accuracy as determined by virtue of more optimal positive/negative likelihood ratios. Conditional recommendation. Certainty of evidence moderate. Recommendation 2b: We suggest against component testing in addition to either to skin prick test or sIgE to whole peanut to increase diagnostic accuracy. Conditional recommendation. Certainty of evidence: very low 7 Discussion: For GRADE analysis, Ara h 2 was compared to skin prick test and sIgE to whole peanut for 152 the diagnosis of peanut allergy. (See Summary of GRADE Question below and review the Evidence to 153 Recommendation Table for details) The literature search did not provide patient-level data to determine 154 the value of testing for peanut components in addition to or reflexively with skin prick test or sIgE to 155 whole peanut to increase diagnostic accuracy. In addition, expert evidence was not available to assist in 156 answering this question. Thus, the use and value of components, including reflexive use of Ara h 2, 157 remains a knowledge gap. There is an unclear utility for measuring sIgE to any other commercially 158 available peanut components given the limited available data on performance of components beyond Ara 159 h 2. Further research is needed to clarify the value of tandem testing, particular in regards to Ara h 2, Ara 160 h 6, and Ara h 8. 161 162 Question 3: In the patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy, can the results 163 of a diagnostic test be used to predict the severity of a future allergic reaction? 164 Recommendation 3: We suggest against the clinician using the results of a SPT, sIgE to whole peanut 165 extract, or sIgE to peanut components to determine the severity of an allergy phenotype or to predict the 166 severity of a future reaction. Conditional recommendation. Certainty of evidence: very low. 167 168 Discussion: There was inadequate patient-level data to formulate a GRADE recommendation on the 169 use of a diagnostic test for predicting the severity of a future allergy reaction to peanut. 170 171 Executive Summary References: 172 1.

J Allergy Clin Immunol 2017;139:29-44. 212 213 214 215 The following primer section helps provide background context on peanut allergy and the principles of 216 how to apply diagnostic testing for peanut allergy. The next sections detail specific applications of 217 diagnostic testing, determined through evidence-synthesis, meta-analysis, and systematic review to 218 provide a clinical practice guideline for the clinician. 219 220 9 Prevalence of peanut allergy 221 In the general population, the prevalence of PA is approximately 1.5% when the diagnosis is based on 222 OFC or highly convincing history, and 0.2% to 0.4% when it is based on OFC alone.1 These values may 223 differ based on age, race, ethnicity, and geography, but the evidence is not available to precisely 224 determine what those differences are. Recent Australian data representative of the greater Victoria 225 province in one year olds suggests the rate of peanut allergy could be as high as 3%, with as many as 23% 226 of these cases resolving by age 4, and 31% by age 6.2-5 US estimates range between 1.4%-4.5%, based on 227 various indirect methods including phone surveys, internet surveys, and analysis of clinical history and 228 epinephrine prescribing patterns.6-8 As well, the prevalence of peanut allergy may change with age. 229 Prevalence estimates also vary depending on how peanut allergy is defined. Many studies use peanut 230 sensitization (at a particular level of detection) to define peanut allergy, while others accept a convincing 231 history of a clinical reaction.6,9,10 However, the criterion standard is an oral food challenge in which a 232 clear outcome based on peanut ingestion is determined.4. Unsurprisingly, reported prevalence rates are 233 higher in studies that include patients diagnosed based on either peanut sensitization and/or a reported 234 convincing clinical history compared to estimates derived from patients diagnosed objectively through 235 OFC. However, there may be some ethical and practical concern in performing OFC for the purpose of 236 confirming prevalence rates using this criterion standard in such aforementioned individuals who already 237 have a clinical diagnosis.6,8 Understanding the prevalence rate of any allergy helps to determine the 238 relative likelihood that any patient being evaluated could have the allergy, and sets the basis for 239 interpreting any diagnostic test that may be able to infer likelihood of diagnosis through simple tools like 240 Fagan nomograms.11,12 Therefore, it is essential for a clinician to understand how and when performing 241 specific diagnostic tests would provide the highest (or lowest) utility, to help gauge when such tests 242 would be of value in clinical decision-making. 243 Making the Diagnosis 244 Available diagnostic tests for assessing peanut sensitization 245 Peanut specific IgE can be assessed with either a skin prick test (SPT) or a serologic in-vitro (blood) 246 test. SPT assesses the presence of sIgE through formation of a wheal and erythema following 247 percutaneous introduction of the target allergen. SPTs are based on extracts of whole peanut and therefore 248 do not provide information about sensitization to individual peanut proteins (peanut components), though 249 10 extracts of recombinant components have been studied in research situations. Prick-to-prick testing with 250 ingestible peanut products (e.g., peanut butter, powder, or kernels) as an alternative to testing with peanut 251 extracts has been advocated by some, but the reproducibility, validity and reliability of this procedure is 252 not established as a marker of sensitization, and this additional test in combination with the clinical 253 history has uncertain value for clinical decision-making.11 254 255 A multitude of in-vitro tests for specific IgE are available using a variety of technologies. Modern-day 256 serologic IgE tests rely on allergens that are attached to a solid phase substrate and detect IgE bound to 257 those allergens using anti-human IgE antibodies conjugated to enzymes that create a colored (enzyme-258 linked immunosorbent or ELISA) or fluorescent (fluorescent enzyme immunoassay or FEIA) 259 product. There also are technologies that measure the capture of specific IgE bound to allergen in liquid 260 phase with subsequent detection using an appropriate enzyme-substrate. The amount of sIgE is 261 determined by comparing the dilution curves of the unknown samples with a calibration curve based on 262 samples with known sIgE.11 Non-specific IgE binding resulting in false positive results (e.g., falsely 263 indicating sensitization) is a potential risk when samples are assessed from patients that are known to 264 have high total IgE levels, but is accounted for by the manufacturer in how the instruments are 265 calibrated.6 Generally, these tests are considered to be quantitative and to have a relatively low coefficient 266 of variance (e.g., approximately 5%). Most commercially available tests for peanut-specific IgE measure 267 sIgE directed at an extract of whole peanut, similar to what is used in skin testing. However, most 268 allergens contain multiple epitopes, each of which may be associated with the ability to specifically bind 269 IgE, and the potential for resulting distinct symptom patterns.13 Patients may be sensitized to one or more 270 components, which represent major allergens within peanut that IgE can bind to (such as the major 271 allergens Ara h 1, Ara h 2, or Ara h 3; Ara=arachnic hypogeae, the Latin name for peanut, and major 272 allegens are named based on their Latin names in the order of their discovery). There are now 273 commercially available tests to measure select peanut components. Components are not available for 274 skin testing outside of the research setting.13 275 276 Evaluation of Suspected Peanut Allergy 277 11 To properly use any allergy diagnostic test to evaluate for possible peanut allergy, the pre-test 278 probability must be determined, which is accomplished through taking a comprehensive history.11,14 279 Typically, patients present to a clinician for an evaluation of a suspected history of peanut allergy, usually 280 having experienced symptoms (in some form) believed to be attributable to peanut ingestion, which 281 represents a situation in which there is high pre-test probability. However, sometimes tests are run on 282 individuals without such a history (possibly as part of a diagnostic testing panel), such as someone who 283 has never eaten peanut before, or even in individuals who eat peanut and do not develop symptoms. As a 284 general rule, persons who can eat peanut without developing symptoms are by definition not allergic and 285 should not be tested for peanut allergy. The situation is a bit more nuanced when considering an 286 individual for testing who has never before ingested peanut, or in someone where oropharyngeal 287 symptoms most consistent with pollen food allergy syndrome present distinctly, in the absence of other 288 typical IgE mediated symptoms. In general, the pre-test probability for allergy would be very low, so that 289 even if the test were detecting sensitization, the post-test odds would remain low. However, there may be 290 certain situations where a patient who has never before ingested peanut has other risk factors, such as 291 moderate or severe eczema poorly responsive to therapy or a history of other food allergy, which may 292 elevate the pre-test probability above that of the general population (but still lower than someone 293 presenting with a history of a suspected reaction). In these scenarios, the clinician may desire to test 294 these patients given the pre-test probability is potentially elevated or for more practical reasons such as if 295 the test result will help the patient to make a decision whether they will introduce peanut. This is an 296 example of preference-sensitive care, and requires delicate handling of the risks and benefits of all 297 available options of how to manage detectable sensitization on testing with lower yet still elevated pre-298 test probability. With a detectable sensitization obtained in this context, performing an OFC (presuming 299 both clinician and patient are willing) can be very helpful but needs to be balanced by how strongly the 300 clinician and patient believe the positive test result indicates a high probability of allergy and the 301 understanding of the risk and downstream consequences of a conflating sensitization and allergy.14,15 302 303 However, most cases do not present asymptomatically. In assessing the clinical history, close 304 attention should be paid to the nature of the presenting symptoms (to make sure these are consistent with 305 mast-cell mediator release characteristic of an IgE mediated reaction), and the timing of when these 306 symptoms developed in association with known or suspected peanut ingestion. Symptoms typically 307 12 develop within minutes to up to about 2 hours if they are related to the peanut ingestion, and rarely 308 develop outside this time window. Non-classical symptoms or time courses that fall outside this interval 309 should decrease the suspicion of peanut allergy, though the clinician may have to consider the 310 significance of an eruption/exacerbation of atopic dermatitis in a child potentially associated with peanut 311 ingestion several hours after ingestion.14,15 Diagnostic testing in the patient with a reasonable pre-test 312 probability, established by eliciting a concerning or likely history of symptom development attributable to 313 peanut ingestion, can then be used to help determine the likelihood of a clinical allergy.11,12 This 314 describes a high-utility setting of how such tests can be used. One exception of note is food protein 315 induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) to peanut. This is a non-IgE but immune-mediated reaction, 316 which has a delayed onset presentation (typically 1-4 hours after ingestion), resulting in protracted 317 vomiting to the point that lethargy and color change result, and in rare instances, bloody diarrhea may 318 result at 6-12 hours. These symptoms represent this very distinct entity, which is hallmarked by isolated 319 GI involvement. FPIES is a clinical diagnosis, and testing for the presence of IgE for peanut FPIES is not 320 recommended. FPIES diagnosis and management is discussed elsewhere, and this document does not 321 refer to peanut FPIES management.16 322 323 Potential Exceptions for Testing 324 A major possible exception are high-risk infants being considered for early peanut introduction. As 325 specified in the 2017 NIAID Addendum Guidelines for the prevention of peanut allergy, a special case 326 may be made for screening infants who present with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in the first 4-6 327 months of life that is poorly controlled despite escalating skin care.17 In formulating the Addendum 328 Guidelines for the Prevention of Peanut Allergy, an expert panel appointed by the National Institutes of 329 Allergy and Infectious Disease recommended that this presentation in these infants represents an elevated 330 pre-test probability of some likelihood of \"pre-existing\" peanut allergy (based on data from the Learning 331 Early About Peanut Allergy Study which used these particular risk factors). Therefore, in this highly 332 specific subgroup the guidelines do recommend strong consideration that either peanut SPT or sIgE 333 testing be obtained and interpreted before early peanut introduction in these infants. However, outside of 334 this very circumscribed group, there are otherwise no formal recommendations that any individual should 335 have peanut SPT or sIgE testing before peanut introduction specifically as a screening measure for risk-336 assessment.17 337 13 338 Historically, another potential exception involved testing children with moderate to severe atopic 339 dermatitis to the common 8 food allergens (including peanut), even if these foods were never previously 340 consumed. This practice reflected a concern that eczema is a precursor symptom of and a significant risk 341 factor for developing food allergy, and represents a situation where the pre-test probability is potentially 342 raised over that of the baseline general population to some degree. In these children, a diagnosis of 343 allergy was typically made based on research that extrapolated positive predictive values taken from 344 groups of children at referral centers with severe eczema who underwent oral food challenge.18 In recent 345 years, this practice has largely fallen out of favor as there has been better understanding of a) the 346 limitations of sensitization as a determinant of clinical allergy, b) the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis 347 occurring independently and not as a marker pathognomonic for undiagnosed food allergy, c) the risks of 348 prolonged allergen avoidance as a factor that may paradoxically increase the risk of food allergy 349 development, and d) the observation that indiscriminant \"screening creep\" was occurring in children 350 without risk factors or overt symptoms and the predictive values were being used to establish \"diagnosis\" 351 out of their very tightly established context. 1 The underlying properties of the diagnostic tests themselves 352 make their use as diagnostic screening measures perilous, given they are poorly specific and of optimal 353 utility in the setting of high pre-test probability. Asymptomatic, clinically irrelevant peanut sensitization 354 is common. 355 356 Interpreting peanut allergy sensitization 357 Allergy testing only confirms or refutes the presence of sensitization, requires \"clinical correlation\" 358 not unlike a radiographic image, and does not independently diagnose allergic disease. Pre-test 359 probability can be translated to post-test odds, using the positive or negative likelihood ratios associated 360 with the sensitivity and specificity of these tests, which can then be used to provide a recommendation 361 regarding diagnosis.11,12 Thus the presence/absence of sensitization increases or decreases the estimated 362 likelihood that a patient may experience a reaction following peanut ingestion. The final probability of 363 reaction is dependent both on the pre-test probability and the characteristics of the diagnostic test. While 364 this can be translated using a Fagan nomogram, 12 the process is rather intuitive in clinical practice in 365 many situations. Individuals with a strong history (e.g., high pre-test probability) who are sensitized 366 14 above a critical threshold can be more confidently diagnosed with peanut allergy, and a person with a 367 non-specific/weak history (e.g. low pre-test probability) and a negative or equivocally positive test 368 indicating the presence of sensitization can be more confidently assessed as not having peanut allergy. In 369 individuals with more questionable histories with a less clear pre-test probability, the test positive or 370 negative likelihood ratio then becomes more crucial in influencing the direction of the decision-making, 371 and ultimately diagnostic confidence may be low enough that an oral food challenge (OFC) still may be 372 necessary to definitively establish diagnosis.1,14,15,19 373 374 Clinical Conundrums Related to Testing 375 As alluded to earlier, there are situations where the clinician may encounter a patient in whom testing 376 was potentially inappropriately obtained, such as in a person with no risk-factors and no history of peanut 377 ingestion leading to symptoms. These individuals may be peanut sensitized, but the sensitization is 378 difficult to interpret given the lack of clinical data to determine context of the test value. Here we see two 379 possible management choices. In clinical practice, many may follow prior data establishing positive 380 predictive values (most representative of small populations of eczematous children undergoing OFC at a 381 referral center)18 for large skin tests or elevated peanut sIgE that may result in a potential misdiagnosis of 382 peanut allergy leading to unnecessary avoidance. Alternatively, this could be viewed as a situation where 383 a test was obtained with low pre-test probability, requiring OFC to provide diagnostic clarity.20 Another 384 conundrum is the use of so-called \"alternative tests\" for peanut allergy that are becoming popular, and are 385 frequently utilized by non board-certified allergists or marketed directly to patients to order for use at 386 home without provider involvement. Testing for peanut-specific IgG4 in either the symptomatic or non-387 symptomatic patient is not indicated, and no role for IgG4 levels in the current diagnostic paradigm 388 exists.21,22 The role of IgG4 is not well understood, but in studies of food oral immunotherapy and 389 pollen/venom immunotherapy, IgG4 levels to the allergen in question have been noted to increase as the 390 patient becomes desensitized. As such, no defined association between allergic reactivity and IgG4 levels 391 exists. In addition, a multitude of other non-validated alternative tests are utilized by alternative medicine 392 practitioners but have no role in the diagnosis of peanut allergy. This includes Mediator Release Testing, 393 ALCAT testing, Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Technique, muscle-provocation testing, 394 electrodermal analysis, and hair/urine analysis.21,22 Providers should be aware of these tests, as well as the 395 15 lack of evidence supporting use, as patients may either request such testing, or have already been 396 subjected to them. Both the AAAAI and the ACAAI have discouraged use of these alternative tests. 397 398 Utility of the Oral Food Challenge (OFC)in Diagnosing Peanut Allergy 399 The OFC remains the criterion reference standard test to define peanut or any food allergy.1,14,15 The 400 OFC generally provides a definitive diagnosis as the outcome is apparent\u2014under medical supervision to 401 observe the outcome, either the person will tolerate ingestion or react. OFCs are rarely indeterminate, so 402 long as the patient can cooperate and ingest the full challenge dose, or subjective symptoms can be 403 avoided. While the double blind, placebo-controlled food challenge is considered the most objective 404 form of OFC (and decreases the likelihood of subjective symptoms complicating interpreting the 405 outcome), open OFC's are usually sufficient for clinical diagnosis and are more practical to conduct, 406 though this has not been directly studied for comparison and represents expert opinion.1 Inherent in the 407 label \"challenge\", this implies the outcome is not known beforehand, and thus any challenge carries a risk 408 of a potential allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, so the clinician must be prepared to potentially 409 treat, and the patient be made aware of such risks.1,19 Detailed guidance on conducting OFCs in patients 410 is provided elsewhere. 23,24 OFCs are considered both time- and resource-intensive by some, and require 411 dedicated office space and provider expertise, which may make them less appealing to some providers to 412 conduct.25 However, this is a routine office-based procedure with a superb safety record in the hands of 413 experienced providers.1,23 414 A decision to offer an OFC is complex and individualized, and providers approach this with a 415 variable degree of expertise, comfort, and desire to offer the procedure.25 OFC can be used to rule in as 416 well as rule out a diagnosis. However with high pre-test probability, the necessity to offer diagnostic 417 OFC may be low (e.g., when either the outcome is very likely to result in a reaction, or very likely to be 418 tolerated).1,18,23,26 This procedure becomes of greater importance when the probability of having had a 419 reaction to peanut is poorly determinable based on pre-test probability, and testing does not provide much 420 assistance in formulating post-test odds. In this context the OFC can provide an objective outcome to 421 inform decision-making. However, while in such situations there may be obvious utility to perform an 422 OFC, the decision to ultimately do so may depend on patient-specific and provider-specific factors like 423 anxiety, vulnerability, desire to eat peanut as well as the clinical judgement and willingness of the 424 16 clinician to perform the procedure.14,23,26 Patients and families that are particularly anxious about eating 425 peanut might prefer to avoid peanut, even with a lower probability of reaction, rather than undergo OFC. 426 427 Overview of guideline development process 428 429 This practice parameter was developed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, 430 Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. GRADE is a well-established methodology for 431 developing evidence-based guidelines, detailed elsewhere.27-29 In formulating the replies to four key 432 questions we took into account the quality of evidence for treatment efficacy, combining this with 433 patients' safety, achieving adherence, and cost. Table 1details the GRADE recommendations and 434 evidence ratings. For more details of the GRADE process please see appendix 1. 435 In 2017, the Joint Taskforce on Practice Parameters submitted a concept for a peanut allergy clinical 436 practice guideline (which replaces the former nomenclature used, practice parameter) to the 437 AAAAI/ACAAI parent organizations. The JTFPP identified 4 liaisons to help identify content experts to 438 form a working group. Historically, the practice parameters have been evidenced based documents, 439 usually covering many aspects of an allergy-related topic, e.g., diagnostic testing. The initial concept of 440 the peanut diagnostic guideline was of a limited guideline answering only a few questions but developed 441 similar to the previous practice parameters. However, during late 2017 and 2018, the workgroup and 442 JTFPP decided to use the GRADE process to develop this guideline. The workgroup conducted periodic 443 calls to develop central questions to be answered through systematic reviews using the GRADE process, 444 develop a search strategy to identify and review the relevant literature. The working group was divided 445 into individual subgroups to evaluate the identified literature and draft the recommendations based upon 446 the GRADE analysis, and following AMSTAR-2 criteria for systematic reviews.30 A working draft was 447 prepared by the workgroup, which was then reviewed and modified by the JTFPP. Both groups were 448 provided the opportunity to comment, propose changes, and approve or disapprove each statement. 449 Consensus was sought and reached for each recommendation's direction and strength. Actual or potential 450 conflicts of interest were disclosed annually and transparency of discussion was maintained. A final draft 451 was then approved by the JTFPP and sent to AAAAI and ACAAI appointed reviewers who were asked to 452 comment on the statements and the rationale within free text fields. All these comments and suggestions 453 17 were discussed during an JTFPP teleconference. For each comment or suggestion, the JTF evaluated 454 whether the statement needed to be adapted, again taking into account the balance between desirable and 455 undesirable consequences of the alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence, and the 456 variability in values and preferences. 457 Concurrent with the AAAAI and ACAAI review, a working draft of the guideline was then posted on 458 the AAAAI, ACAAI, and JTFPP websites for all members and the public at large to review. For each 459 comment or suggestion, the JTF evaluated whether the statement needed to be adapted, again taking into 460 account the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of the alternative management 461 strategies, the quality of the evidence, and the variability in values and preferences. The finalized draft 462 was then sent to this journal for additional peer review before publication. 463 464 GRADE Methodology 465 Development of Searchable Questions 466 Prior to conducting a literature search, 4 pre-specified PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, 467 Outcomes) format question were formulated by the workgroup and the JTF as per standard GRADE 468 approach. 31 The population for study included published data for patients with known or highly 469 suspected peanut allergy, who underwent oral food challenge (open or blinded) to establish/confirm a 470 clinical outcome of peanut allergy in at least 50% of participants, where both serologic assessment of 471 peanut allergen components (Ara h 1,2,3,6,8) and/or prick skin testing to whole peanut extract or sIgE 472 testing to whole peanut were obtained as markers of peanut sensitization. 473 The questions developed were the following: 474 1. In adults and children with a history of suspected peanut allergy and requesting evaluation what are 475 the indications to perform or not perform diagnostic test(s)? 476 Population: Adults and children presenting for the evaluation of suspected peanut allergy 477 Intervention: Perform a diagnostic test for peanut allergy based upon history provided 478 Comparator: Not perform a diagnostic test for peanut allergy based upon history provided 479 Outcomes: Accuracy of history in determining need for diagnostic testing for peanut allergy 480 481 18 2a. In the patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy, should the provider use a skin 482 prick test, a serum-specific IgE test, or both? 483 Population: Adults and children presenting for the evaluation of peanut allergy 484 Intervention: Using skin prick testing (SPT), serum specific IgE to whole peanut (sIgE) or both to 485 determine peanut sensitization to assist in the diagnosis of peanut allergy 486 Comparator: Oral food challenge 487 Outcomes: Diagnostic accuracy of peanut allergy testing (true/false positive, true/false negative 488 tests) 489 2b. In the patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy, does testing peanut components 490 in addition to SPT or sIgE whole peanut increase diagnostic accuracy? 491 Population: Adults and children presenting for the evaluation of peanut allergy 492 Intervention: Using peanut component testing, e.g., Ara h 2, in addition to SPT or sIgE whole peanut 493 to determine peanut sensitization to assist in the diagnosis of peanut allergy 494 Comparator: Oral food challenge 495 Outcomes: Diagnostic accuracy of peanut allergy testing (true/false positive, true/false negative 496 tests) 497 498 3. In the patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy, do the results of diagnostic tests 499 for peanut allergy, in addition to the patient history, help to predict the severity of a future allergic 500 reaction to peanuts? 501 Population: Adults and children presenting for the evaluation of suspected peanut allergy 502 Intervention: Performing a diagnostic test(s) for peanut allergy to help predict the severity of a future 503 allergic reaction to peanuts 504 Comparator: Predicting the severity of a future allergic reaction to peanuts based solely upon the 505 history and without the use of a diagnostic test for peanut allergy 506 Outcomes: Accurate prediction of the severity of a future allergic reaction to peanuts 507 508 Literature Search and Study Eligibility 509 19 In conjunction with a medical librarian (KS), a detailed pre-specified search strategy was developed, 510 with input from the working group, as well as based on recently published systematic reviews on peanut 511 allergy diagnostic testing. Study selection was limited to human subjects of any age who were seeking 512 evaluation for the diagnosis of peanut allergy, English language studies published or in press starting 513 from 1946-2018. The finalized search parameters were then independently run on Medline (PubMed 514 1946-2018) and Embase (Elsevier 1947-2018) databases, with the results combined and filtered for 515 duplicates. A total of 1,314 potential references were identified and transferred into Covidence for 516 review by 4 taskforce members (MG, MS, JW, JO), where 127 studies were identified for full text review 517 by the same 4 authors, resulting in a final selection of 89 studies for data extraction pertaining to 518 searchable questions under GRADE format. (Figure 1a-d, overall PRISMA diagram and diagrams by 519 individual searchable question; Appendix 1, literature search strategy). The search results were combined 520 and culled for duplicate entries, then uploaded into Covidence, where a minimum of two study team 521 members independently reviewed each study for eligibility for full-text review, to determine inclusion, 522 with this process repeated to determine the final studies for data extraction. Conflicts regarding inclusion 523 were resolved by a third study team member. Studies where OFC was not performed as part of the 524 assessment accompanying the diagnostic testing were excluded (including cohort and observational 525 studies based on patient-reported or chart-reported history of peanut allergy involving the use of the 526 aforementioned diagnostic tests without OFC confirmation) but was inclusive of either prospective, 527 retrospective, cross-sectional, or case-control methodologies from both pediatric and adult populations. 528 The full-text versions of the final studies meeting inclusion were reviewed for data extraction of the 529 measures of diagnostic accuracy including sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value, and 530 the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. No individual patient 531 level data was sought. Individual study authors were contacted to provide additional data for the 532 following reasons: 533 1) To clarify information pertaining to number of successful and non-successful challenges relative 534 to a reported cut-off level of the test in question, where such data was not available or 535 calculatable, so that sensitivity and specificity could be calculated (e.g., obtain the cells to inform 536 true/false positive and true/false negative according to our pre-specified thresholds) 537 2) To request data not presented/analyzed in the selected paper according to the cut-off levels chosen 538 as part of this review, to enable re-tallying of the true/false positive and true/false negative cases 539 20 3) To see if additional data regarding other searchable questions was potentially available, that had 540 not been published 541 Studies selected for data extraction were excluded if the aforementioned measures of diagnostic testing 542 accuracy were not directly reported in the manuscript; upon final review the population, use/application 543 of the index test, use/application of the reference standard was deemed to not fit the pre-specified 544 inclusion criteria; or the study team could not/did not provide the requested additional details for more 545 tailored data to be reported per our extraction parameters upon being contacted to provide this 546 information. 547 548 Outcomes and Data Synthesis 549 Based on the diagnostic test used, the extracted number of true positives, false positives, true 550 negatives, and false negatives with respect to oral food challenge outcome were recorded into a MS Excel 551 spreadsheet, as classified by a conservative cut-off level of these tests (for diagnosis, >0.35 KUA/L for 552 sIgE and Ara Ara h 2 sIgE, >10 553 mm for SPT) relative to the oral food challenge performed in the study. To assess potential influence of 554 Ara h 6 and Ara h 8 on diagnostic accuracy, pre-specified subgroup analyses were planned based on data 555 availability. Meta-analysis of the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios 556 (with visual display of these ratios) on a Fagan Nomogram set to a range of potential lower (30%) and 557 higher (70%) situational pre-test probabilities of a patient having peanut allergy. Data analysis was 558 performed in Stata, version 15 using the MIDAS command (peto method, random effects model).32 Study 559 heterogeneity was reported by the I2 statistic. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. 560 Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots when possible. 33 GRADEpro software was used to 561 construct the evidence profiles and calculate the absolute effects.34 Pre-specified sensitivity analyses were 562 planned to explore inclusion only of trials with double blinded challenges as opposed to other challenge 563 types, to assess the effects of geographical region of study, and pediatric vs. non-pediatric studies if 564 permissible. Additional post-hoc sensitivity analyses were performed to verify impact of inclusion of any 565 study on the estimates where there was elevated risk of bias based on patient selection and flow/timing, 566 comparison of individual pooled test precision where SPT/sIgE, sIgE/Ara h 2, or all 3 tests were 567 simultaneously performed, (which per the joint task force was prioritized as the top sensitivity analysis to 568 21 report despite this being post hoc, given it most directly answers the searched questions). Data were 569 additionally synthesized narratively. The systematic review process followed AMSTAR2 criteria.30 570 Lastly, cost-effectiveness analysis using simulated cohorts with Markov modeling over a 20-year horizon, 571 from a societal perspective, was performed to assess simulated health and economic benefits of the use of 572 the individual diagnostic tests (see supplemental methods). 573 A working protocol for the parameter and the systematic review was devised by the JTFPP liaisons 574 and registered with PROSPERO. 575 576 Reaching workgroup consensus on statements and conclusions: 577 Where GRADE was not appropriate to answer a particular question, the workgroup employed a 578 modified Delphi process for the determination of the \"Strength of the recommendation\" and the 579 \"Statement profile\" for each question. The Delphi method is a structured, interactive, decision-making 580 process used by a panel of experts to arrive at a consensus when there are differing views and 581 perspectives. 35-37 For any statement or conclusion in which there was a difference of opinion, a modified 582 Delphi method was used. Workgroup members provided anonymous answers via email to the JTFPP 583 administrative director (AD) to the questions being considered. The AD provided via teleconference an 584 anonymous summary of the experts' answers and reasons they provided for their responses. The 585 workgroup members discussed all the answers and then were encouraged to modify their answers on the 586 next round(s) of email voting and teleconferences until a consensus was reached. 587 588 Results 589 Question 1: Should diagnostic testing for peanut allergy be performed in adults and children with a 590 history of suspected peanut allergy who are requesting evaluation for peanut allergy? 591 592 Recommendation 1a: We suggest in favor of diagnostic (skin prick or serum sIgE) testing for 593 peanut allergy in patients with a 1) physician-judged high pre-test probability of peanut allergy, or 2) 594 prior to an oral food challenge for patients with moderate pre-test probability of peanut allergy, with 595 22 whom shared decision-making has been employed to arrive at the final decision. Conditional 596 recommendation; Certainty of evidence: very low 597 598 Recommendation 1b: We suggest against diagnostic testing in patients where there is low or very 599 low pre-test probability of peanut allergy. Conditional recommendation; Certainty of evidence: very 600 low 601 602 Agreement the Delphi: This question was determined to not be searchable under GRADE format. 604 605 Evidence Summary 606 This question was not searched in a systematic manner as the content experts were unaware of any single 607 research study that addressed this question. However, expert evidence was collected both from the 608 content experts, the JTFPP, and the known prior literature most relevant to this topic. Expert evidence 609 differs from expert opinion, in that the former does not include a judgment on the evidence and offers a 610 systematic and transparent appraisal of the evidence.38 611 Discussion 612 Testing for peanut allergy is of the highest utility when there is a history of a known or suspected 613 ingestion of peanut leading to symptoms of an IgE mediated reaction. The identification of individuals for 614 whom testing is indicated requires careful consideration of the clinical history and of epidemiologic risk 615 factors which may increase or decrease the odds of having peanut allergy (e.g., severe atopic dermatitis or 616 another food allergy). Persons with no history of peanut ingestion or an unknown history of ingestion 617 (without other potential risk factors for developing food allergy), or who asymptomatically ingest peanut 618 with impunity should generally not be tested for peanut allergy.14,15 The estimated pre-test probability of 619 peanut allergy in these situations is very low, and in most circumstances detection of sensitization will 620 not shift the post-test odds of diagnosis appreciably and will require peanut challenge to resolve the 621 diagnosis. Peanut allergy testing itself is not diagnostic of peanut allergy, as asymptomatic sensitization 622 is somewhat common.1 Therefore, identifying individuals with a strong pre-test probability for peanut 623 23 allergy is imperative in the optimal use of diagnostic testing and making an accurate diagnosis of peanut 624 allergy. 625 626 Apart from the high-risk infant meeting NIAID addendum 1 criteria, there are potential situations where 627 some providers may ascribe a higher pre-test probability of peanut allergy to a child who has never eaten 628 peanut, and feel that testing may be desired. These generally apply to peanut na\u00efve individuals with other 629 potential risk factors for developing food allergy (e.g., moderate to severe eczema and/or other food 630 allergy), where the pre-test probability may be variably elevated but generally perceived as greater than 631 that of the general population, though still lower than someone with a suspected reaction history. For 632 example, consider the cases of the younger sibling of a peanut allergic child whose family is reluctant to 633 introduce peanut; a child with milk, egg, tree nut or other food allergy; or the child with delayed peanut 634 introduction for other reasons. The decision to test in these circumstances represents a preference-635 sensitive care option, and in the context of shared decision-making and a thorough explanation of the 636 risks and benefits associated with the preference-sensitive care choices, testing for peanut sensitization 637 may be a reasonable choice. This choice is subject to shared decision making with the patient, and 638 consideration of the risks and benefits of the potential use of oral challenge to help confirm the test 639 results, the magnitude of the degree to which the risk is appreciably different than that of the general 640 population, as well as the potential for the likelihood and consequences of overdiagnosis resulting from 641 detection of asymptomatic peanut sensitization if a challenge is not performed. No decision-aid for this 642 has been developed, however, though this would be potentially useful. 643 To some degree, clinicians should be advised that they should be prepared to offer oral food challenge to 644 patients where the pre-test probability is no higher than moderate, uncertainty remains, and the patient 645 still desires testing. The risks and consequences of a diagnosis of varying potential accuracy or 646 probability related to a potentially false positive detection of sensitization may or may not outweigh the 647 potential benefit gained through an at-home introduction or an in-office OFC for some families. Table 2 648 details some considerations for these situations. Testing the younger sibling of a peanut allergic 649 individual (who does not otherwise meet the addendum 1 high-risk criteria) before peanut introduction 650 has not been shown to be cost-effective unless: a) the baseline prevalence of peanut allergy in younger 651 siblings is >11%; b) that every peanut sensitized child undergoes an OFC to determine actual outcome; 652 and c) the health utility detriment from the initial reaction to peanut was only experienced with at-home 653 24 introduction and not under an OFC in the office. Without OFC being performed, pre-testing was only 654 cost-effective if the baseline prevalence of peanut allergy in younger siblings was >63%.39 655 656 More importantly, it is also crucial to consider the patient who presents to the allergist's office with a test 657 indicating detection of peanut sensitization, but has never eaten peanut before. Here, the context (e.g. the 658 presumed pre-test probability) under which the test denoting sensitization was obtained (and its potential 659 interpretation) also requires careful consideration. This as well may represent a situation of a preference-660 sensitive choice where a role for shared decision-making arises, with consideration for the benefit of 661 performing an OFC to better determine the outcome should be very carefully weighed against the risk of 662 potential misdiagnosis (and recommended avoidance) from a falsely positive test. The presence of the 663 detectable peanut sensitization itself cannot, however, be used as a condition of \"elevated\" pre-test 664 probability. 665 666 Question 2a: In the patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy, which of the 667 three tests\u2014SPT, sIgE to whole peanut, or Ara h2 would provide the highest diagnostic accuracy 668 as determined by the more optimal positive/negative likelihood ratio? 669 Question 2b: In a patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy, does testing for 670 peanut components in addition to either SPT or sIgE to whole peanut increase the diagnostic 671 accuracy? 674 675 676 677 678 679 Recommendation 2a: We suggest in favor of Ara h 2 diagnostic testing in a patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy for which a single diagnostic test is to be used, as Ara h 2 would provide the best diagnostic accuracy as determined by virtue of more optimal positive/negative likelihood ratios. Conditional recommendation. Certainty of evidence: moderate. Recommendation 2b: We suggest against component testing be sent in addition to either to skin prick test or sIgE to whole peanut to increase diagnostic accuracy. Conditional recommendation. Certainty of evidence: very low 25 Clinical Statement: For GRADE analysis, Ara h 2 was compared to skin prick test and sIgE to whole 680 peanut for the diagnosis of peanut allergy. Providers can interchangeably use either SPT or serologic 681 testing for whole peanut extract IgE, taking into account availability of the test, patient preference, safety, 682 cost, and whether there are patient factors that preclude use of one or both tests. Both tests have high 683 sensitivity but poor specificity in identifying oral food challenge reactive patients at cut-off levels of 684 3mm wheal size SPT or 0.35 KUA/L peanut-specific IgE. No data were available regarding use of the 685 tests in tandem or reflexively. In sensitivity analyses where both tests were available, there was minimal 686 difference in the overall sensitivity/specificity between these modalities, and these were similar to the 687 precision in the base analyses of each test individually. However, as a single stand-alone test, compared 688 to either SPT or sIgE testing to whole peanut extract, Ara h 2 has the most optimal combination of 689 positive and negative likelihood ratio, and has drastically enhanced specificity, likely decreasing the 690 number of false positive cases where sensitization is detected. Despite the test characteristics, future 691 research is needed to better clarify if Ara h 2 should be used as a stand-alone measure of peanut 692 sensitization in the patient seeking evaluation for possible peanut allergy. In studies where Ara h 2 was 693 evaluated with sIgE or where all 3 tests were evaluated, the precision advantage for Ara h 2 did not 694 change. A potential risk associated with using Ara h 2 as a stand-alone test is that an allergic individual 695 may be sensitized to other components but not to Ara h 2, though this may be balanced by superior test 696 precision of this approach. 697 698 The literature search did not provide patient-level data to determine the value of testing for peanut 699 components in addition to skin prick test or sIgE to whole peanut to increase diagnostic accuracy. Thus, 700 the use and value of components, including reflexive use of Ara h 2, remains a knowledge gap. There is 701 an unclear utility for measuring sIgE to any other commercially available peanut components (Ara h 1, 702 Ara h 3, Ara h 6, Ara h 8, Ara h 9) if peanut sIgE is elevated or SPT >3mm (both indicating 703 sensitization), given the limited available data on performance of components beyond Ara h 2. 704 Evidence Summary (Questions 2a and 2b): 705 For SPT and sIgE to whole peanut, from the 89 articles selected for final evidence synthesis, 56 706 directly pertained to this question. Of these, 32 had data available for extraction (5 studies had no data 707 available, 10 authors did not respond to requests for data, and 9 studies had available data but could not 708 26 be analyzed due to zero-cell interactions in the 2x2 table). A total of 18 studies (n=2124 patients) were 709 pooled for evidence synthesis for SPT40-52 and 30 studies (n=3989 patients) for sIgE.40-44,46,47,49,50,52-66 No 710 literature was identified that detailed the simultaneous, tandem, or reflexive use of both SPT and sIgE to 711 whole peanut. Figure 2a details the summary forest plot for the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and both 712 positive and negative likelihood ratios for a prick skin test to whole peanut extract of 3mm or greater, and 713 Figure 2b for peanut serum-specific IgE of 0.35 KUA/L or higher. The summary measures for each test 714 are presented in table 3. Heterogeneity across these studies was high. Figures 3 and 4 detail Fagan 715 nomograms for a practical general example of how to roughly interpret the utility of these tests, set at a 716 pre-specified pre-test probability of 2% (general population prevalence), 30% (low suspicion) and 70% 717 (high suspicion). These nomograms show that the likelihood ratio for sensitization at 3mm or 0.35 718 KUA/L at 2% or pre-test probability do not post-test odds >50%, but at the 70% pre-test 719 probability this is raised to ~80%. Negative likelihood ratios do largely decrease post-test odds in all 720 three scenarios. Based on these data, both SPT and sIgE to whole peanut can be used interchangeably, 721 and this is a preference-sensitive choice given no discernable advantage in terms of test precision. There 722 were no data noted that indicate using both tests together was disadvantageous. Both SPT and sIgE to 723 whole peanut have similarly high sensitivity but poor specificity, with serologic testing having slightly 724 higher specificity in identifying oral food challenge reactive patients at the assessed cut-off levels. Table 725 3 additionally includes sensitivity analysis for the individual sensitivity/specificity of SPT and sIgE 726 assessed when both tests were assessed in the same study. The clinician should be advised of the inherent 727 weaknesses of either of these tests having poor specificity, in that this may preclude to a higher rate of 728 falsely positive detection of peanut sensitization. 729 For Ara h 2 component-specific IgE, from the 89 articles selected for final evidence synthesis, 41 730 directly pertained to this question. Of these, 24 had data available for extraction (11 authors did not 731 respond to a request for additional data, 6 articles did not have data available). This resulted in a total of 732 24 studies (n=2289 patients) pooled for evidence synthesis.42,43,46,47,53,55,56,60,67-73 49,50,52,61-63,74-76 The 733 summary measures for Ara h 2 are presented in table 3. Figure 5 detail the summary forest plot for the 734 pooled sensitivity and specificity, for Ara h 2 peanut serum-specific IgE of 0.35 KUA/L or higher. 735 Heterogeneity across these studies was high. Figure 6 details Fagan nomograms for the use of these 736 tests, set at a pre-specified pre-test probability of 2% (population prevalence), 30% (low suspicion) and 737 70% (high suspicion). These nomograms show that the likelihood ratio for Ara h 2 sensitization at 0.35 738 27 KUA/L at 2% or 30% probability translate to post-test of 10% and 70%, but at the 70% pre-739 test probability translates to 89% post-test odds. Negative likelihood ratios do largely decrease post-test 740 odds in all three scenarios. 741 We were unable to find sufficient number of studies to analyze any other individual peanut 742 components or pool the use of component panels. Therefore, we can offer no comment regarding the role 743 or significance of evaluating these other components individually or in aggregate, or what the clinical 744 implications of their use may be. Similarly, there were no studies identified comparing reflexive use Ara 745 h 2 or any components after SPT or sIgE. There were no studies identified that evaluated the 746 comparative efficacy of Ara h 2 as a stand-alone test compared to any other component or whole peanut 747 PST or sIgE in their use for clinical decision-making. A potential advantage Ara h 2 relative to SPT and 748 sIgE to whole peanut is higher specificity, which may reduce the number of falsely positive cases of 749 sensitization identified, though a disadvantage is this could risk a falsely negative case if someone is 750 sensitized to other components but not Ara h 2. However, the high sensitivity and specificity of the test 751 may limit this risk. In studies where Ara h 2 was evaluated with sIgE or where all 3 tests were evaluated, 752 Ara h 2 consistently had slightly lower sensitivity but much higher specificity, and a more optimal 753 positive/negative likelihood ratio, comparatively. This is similar to the difference noted in the base case 754 where the tests were evaluated individually (Table 3). 755 Quality of Evidence: Tables 4a and 4b details the summary of GRADE evidence for both SPT and sIgE. 756 There is moderate certainty of evidence for use of either test, and the estimate was downgraded one point 757 for risk of bias. Table 5 details the certainty of evidence for the use of Ara h 2. There is moderate 758 certainty of evidence, and this estimate was downgraded one point for risk of bias. 759 Discussion 760 In practice, SPT and sIgE are often used interchangeably and at the preference of the ordering 761 clinician or the family. Many clinicians may use these tests in tandem with one another as well, though no 762 evidence exists to evaluate this practice. A 2009 systematic review by Chafen et al 77 noted no 763 statistically significant differences between the diagnostic utility of food-specific SPT and sIgE when 764 comparing their summary ROC curves. A 2015 systematic review by Klemans et al noted the sensitivity 765 of peanut SPT was 0.66-1 the specificity 0-0.95, and the positive and negative likelihood ratios between 766 1-3.91 and 0-0.65 respectively. For peanut sIgE, this had sensitivity between .8-1%, specificity between 767 28 0-0.63, and positive and negative likelihood ratios between 0.95-2.15 and 0-0.56 respectively.78 Overall 768 both SPT and sIgE to whole peanut have very similar test precision, with a very slight relative advantage 769 in sensitivity (0.01) and specificity (0.05) for skin testing over sIgE testing. In the setting of the high-risk 770 infant being evaluated for early peanut introduction, the guidelines specifically recommend SPT as the 771 preferred modality when available, though non-allergists can elect to send peanut sIgE and refer patients 772 for further evaluation or recommend at-home introduction in this population.17 This recommendation is 773 based on data from the LEAP study, suggesting that skin prick testing provided better classification of 774 peanut allergic infants after peanut challenge than serologic testing. 79 775 There is widespread availability of component testing and several publications have concluded that 776 Ara h 2 may have unique diagnostic value, which has led to debate about whether clinician should 777 routinely test for IgE to peanut components and base diagnostic decisions solely on these results.78 In 778 practice, the clinician has the option to request tests for peanut components in combination with whole 779 peanut SPT and/or peanut specific IgE, or request tests for component testing as a stand-alone test. To 780 date, no practice parameter or clinical practice guideline has advocated selective use of one or a panel of 781 components over whole peanut SPT or sIgE, how components including just assessment of Ara h 2 could 782 be used in tandem or reflexively with these tests, or specifically recommend how use of components 783 definitively provides a diagnostic advantage.1,14,15 There is limited study of other component testing that 784 was found in this literature search. Ara h 6 sensitization is an emerging area of investigation,80 and one 785 study of Ara h 8 mono-sensitization suggested a potential role in discriminating asymptomatic peanut 786 sensitization from allergy, more likely to have clinical relevance in geographic areas where birch pollen is 787 endemic.81,82 However, we found few studies that reported challenge-proven outcomes meeting our 788 selection criteria for components apart from Ara h 2, and very limited studies that evaluated use of single 789 vs. panels of peanut components. Thus, we are precluded from commenting any further on specific use 790 of components such as Ara h 6 or Ara h 8, and their potential value in assisting the clinician in making a 791 diagnosis of peanut allergy. 792 No studies were identified evaluating tandem use of SPT and sIgE to whole peanut. Many studies 793 had both SPT and sIgE measured together, and the individual results are incorporated in the respective 794 analyses. However, offer no recommendation to this tandem approach, perceived to be commonly done 795 in practice. In studies where both SPT and sIgE were reported, the pooled sensitivity/specificity results 796 were very similar to the base analyses, and reflective of those same small differences. Similarly, no 797 29 studies were identified evaluating reflexive or tandem use of Ara h 2 or any component with SPT and 798 sIgE to whole peanut, and it is unclear how component testing would be optimally positioned in a 799 clinician's arsenal. Future studies are required to determine if Ara h 2 should be tested as a stand-alone 800 marker, if components should be tested reflexively after sensitization to whole peanut is denoted or even 801 tested at all. Importantly, in the context of either very strong or very weak pre-test probability, it is 802 debatable if components (including Ara h 2) offer any additional diagnostic leverage over whole peanut 803 testing, or supersedes the OFC if there was any doubt. In such circumstances, even the good positive 804 likelihood ratio associated with Ara h 2 would not likely change the clinical decision-making or provide 805 more value than the OFC. 806 Ara h 2 may have more value vs. other testing options in the context of a questionable history and 807 whole peanut sensitization given its higher specificity, in particular in areas with high birch (or birch 808 cross-reactive) pollen. However, additional research is needed to more robustly evaluate such use, and 809 we noted insufficient numbers of study specifically for this application. There is no universal cut-off 810 value for any component (including Ara h 2) that can used to reliably predict peanut allergy--such levels 811 vary considerably by geographic region, population tested, and possibly by age. 78 83 As was noted in 812 question 1, there may be situations where a clinician may ascribe a higher pre-test probability to child 813 who has never eaten peanut before (apart from those falling under NIAID Addendum 1 814 recommendations), and desire to obtain Ara h 2 component testing. Overall, use of Ara h 2 at present is 815 limited in the capacity of a corroborating test, indicated when there is sufficient pre-test probability for 816 peanut allergy, and not in the capacity of a screening test where there is no pre-test probability. This is 817 demonstrated in the Fagan nomograms in figure 6 and supplemental figure 1, which may help illustrate 818 practical general examples of how the test may be reasonably interpreted under different hypothetical pre-819 test probabilities. 820 There are several other considerations regarding test preference, including safety, cost, patient 821 features that may drive the choice, availability and practice patterns. SPT is associated with an 822 exceptionally rare risk of systemic reactions (0.077%, with 75% of cases attributable to food), though 823 those doing skin testing should be prepared to potentially treat anaphylaxis. 84 There also are data 824 demonstrating that there are more side effects from sIgE testing vs. SPT based on assessment in the 825 NHANES study. The cost of SPT and sIgE tests varies among different offices and laboratories, but has 826 been reported to be from 2-7 times less expensive per test for SPT (typically $3-5 per SPT and $10-20 per 827 30 allergen for sIgE test, including components, though components are presently available only as a full 828 panel). (http://health.costhelper.com/allergy-testing.html) Certain patient-related factors may make SPT difficult 829 to perform, such as inability to stop medications with anti-histamine activity, severe dermatographism, 830 unstable asthma, patients who may be averse to or afraid of the procedure (such as young children) and 831 hard to control eczema with extensive skin involvement.11 However, since SPT can be done on the back 832 or arm or may be possible on other unaffected areas of skin, it is often possible to do the test even with 833 extensive eczema or delay this until the eczema flare has calmed down. The advantage of SPT is that it is 834 a point of care test that can be rapidly performed in clinic, but a trained specialist generally perform this. 835 There are few limitations to sIgE testing, and often multiple allergens can be assessed from 2-5 mL of 836 blood obtained from routine venipuncture. The test is not point of care, however.11 As was noted in 837 question 1, there may be situations in which a clinician may ascribe a higher pre-test probability to a child 838 who has never eaten peanut before (apart from those falling under NIAID Addendum 1 839 recommendations), and desire to obtain peanut PST or sIgE. The Fagan nomograms in figures 3-5 may 840 help provide guidance for how the test may be reasonably interpreted in such a scenario. 841 Test thresholds of 3mm for SPT and 0.35KUA/L for sIgE and Ara h 2 sIgE were chosen for analysis 842 of this question. These represent sensitization levels at which a patient traditionally would be considered 843 to have a test indicating allergic sensitization. These are the most widely published \"cut-off\" levels in the 844 literature, though higher levels, including levels indicative of reported positive predictive values have 845 also been reported, and more recently, lower levels of 0.1 KUA/L are being commonly reported.78,85 We 846 considered different levels (both higher and lower) but disfavored such an approach as this would have 847 reduced the number of citations that would have been available, and made the analysis even more 848 dependent on the goodwill of authors sending us data reconfigured to our needs. A problem unique to the 849 newer conventions of reporting to the technical lower limit of detection at 0.1 KUA/L is that many 850 studies otherwise eligible for inclusion in our search were performed before reporting to this lower 851 standard was available, and would have limited our total numbers. More importantly, we are unaware of 852 any literature indicating that sensitization between 0.1 and 0.34 KUA/L is of clinical significance, as 853 opposed to ample literature that clearly has defined sensitization >0.35 KUA/L as significant.1 Lastly, we 854 did not attempt to provide a PPV for these cut-off levels. The PPV is dependent on a population 855 prevalence of disease, which we do not know and did not assess. Instead, we report likelihood ratios and 856 31 provide example Fagan nomograms for how the test results could be interpreted at a clinic level, which is 857 a more accurate and appropriate analysis.86 858 859 Question 3: In the patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy, can the results of 860 a diagnostic test be used to predict the severity of an allergic reaction? 861 862 Recommendation 3: We suggest against the clinician using the results of a SPT, sIgE to whole peanut 863 extract, or sIgE to peanut components to determine an allergy phenotype or to predict the severity of a 864 future reaction. Conditional recommendation. Certainty of evidence: very low. 865 Clinical statement: 866 There was inadequate patient-level data to formulate a GRADE recommendation on the use of a 867 diagnostic test for predicting the severity of a future allergy reaction to peanut but a subset analysis did 868 not demonstrate any benefit. 869 Evidence Summary: 870 From the 89 articles selected for final evidence synthesis, 31 directly pertained to this question. Of 871 these, 16 had data available for extraction (12 authors did not respond to a request for additional data, 1 872 study did not have data available). A total of 18 studies were pooled for evidence synthesis (10 for Ara h 873 2 at 2 KUA/L, n=845 patients;42,49,50,52,53,56,61,73,8713 for whole peanut sIgE at patients;42,44,49,50,52,56,66,87-90 12 for SPT 10mm, n=737 patients42,49-52,61,66,87,88,90). The summary measures 875 for each test are presented in table 3. Figures 7-9 details the summary forest plot for the pooled 876 sensitivity and specificity for cut off levels for severe reactions for Ara h 2 peanut serum-specific IgE of 2 877 KUA/L or higher, whole peanut sIgE at 50 KUA/L, and for SPT 10mm. Due to both low sensitivity and 878 specificity, with no individual measure greater than 0.68 for any of these analyses, likelihood ratios and 879 Fagan nomograms were not reported. Heterogeneity across these studies was high. Based on these data, 880 this analysis notes exceptionally poor sensitivity and specificity for these cut-off values, which differs 881 from a similar analysis by Klemans et al in a 2015 systematic review where Ara h 2 as a marker of 882 severity was concluded to have more potential. Klemans et al explored several different cut-off levels 883 than we did in this analysis, though did so with far less studies included per cut-off level investigated.78 884 Therefore, the results of this analysis should be interpreted as a significant caution to clinicians against 885 32 using the degree of sensitization to whole peanut (skin/blood) or peanut component (blood) as a surrogate 886 to determine if someone will have a future severe reaction or has a \"severe\" reaction phenotype. This 887 caution is pending further future studies of much higher quality, more consistently defining severity, with 888 less selection bias, and with more patient level data for analysis. There were insufficient numbers of 889 other studies to comment regarding the role or significance of evaluating these other components 890 individually or in aggregate to determine if there is any test that may infer reaction severity. 891 892 Evidence Strength: Tables 6a-c details the certainty of evidence for the use of Ara h 2, sIgE, and SPT at 893 these stated cut-off levels for the assessment of the severity of a reaction. There is very low certainty of 894 evidence for all three of these measures and this estimate was downgraded one point for risk of bias and 895 two points for inconsistency (based on wide CI's of the pooled studies and a different definition of 896 severity among the studies). 897 898 Discussion 899 There is no relationship indicating that the degree of sensitization is predictive of the underlying 900 severity of the reaction to peanut, using either skin or serologic markers, whole allergen or component. 901 This includes any single test, component, or panel of tests. Importantly, the clinician is advised against 902 making the interpretation that any level of sensitization\u2014high or low\u2014will predict if someone will have 903 a severe reaction or not. Per our meta-analysis, there is no relationship with reaction severity from 904 available data, criteria for severity, and reported cut-off levels. Severe reactions can still occur with 905 low/lower sensitization levels. Multiple practice parameters, guidelines and systematic reviews have 906 repeatedly emphasized these points.1,14,15 A few individual peanut component-based studies have 907 suggested some degree of association between the recognition of discrete levels of Ara h 2 and history of 908 a severe allergic reaction, though a greater number of studies have noted no such association, and many 909 of these have multiple biases.78 At our chosen cut-off levels (Ara h 2 PST 10mm, sIgE 50 910 KUA/L), we affirm that no relationship exists, though if patient-level data were available for pooling, it is 911 possible a relationship could exist. We caution that there is very serious risk of bias among even the few 912 numbers of studies we included. In particular, many studies did not assess severity using Ara h 2, and 913 small inclusion numbers may present a misleading estimate due to omission of data. 914 33 There is potential evidence that singular recognition of Ara h 8 sensitization (in the absence of other 915 component recognition) may be a potential discriminator of pollen cross-sensitization in individuals 916 residing in particular geographic areas who are likely to only experience oropharyngeal, transient itching 917 from peanut ingestion (e.g., pollen food allergy syndrome).13 However, we could not analyze this 918 question due to low study numbers evaluating this relationship that met inclusion criteria (specifically 919 that 50% of the population underwent OFC). Furthermore, while some expert opinions may support that 920 Ara h 8 monosensitization is a potential indicator of pollen-food allergy syndrome and surrogate for low 921 risk of a severe reaction, these findings lack definitive confirmation in this and prior meta-analysis.78 922 Importantly, we found insufficient numbers of studies for components apart from Ara h 2 meeting our 923 criteria to pool for analysis and cannot comment on the clinical utility of these tests without further 924 rigorous study to validate this concept. 925 926 Regional geography may influence component sensitization patterns, in particular with the pollen 927 cross-sensitized individuals, which complicate assessing the relationship between sensitization and 928 severity. Two studies have shown differences in component recognition patterns in patients in northern 929 Europe, southern Europe, and the US, as well as differing patterns among different regions in the US 930 which may complicate the use of any particular component as a phenotypic discriminator.81 For instance, 931 in birch endemic areas, Ara h 8 may behave as a cross-sensitizing marker, and has been proposed to help 932 identify such individuals from those recognizing other proteins in peanut. Ara h 9 could have relevance 933 as a component associated with lipid transfer protein syndrome in certain areas of the world (with high 934 potential to cause systemic reaction in sensitized individuals) whereas elsewhere it behaves similarly to 935 Ara h 8 as a marker of tree pollen sensitization.13 Therefore, it is unclear the degree to which severity of a 936 reaction may be affected by such geographical differences influencing component recognition, and this 937 area of component research remains promising, but at present represents a knowledge gap. 938 Importantly, there are issues of bias that must strongly be considered regarding the studies noting an 939 association between sensitization levels and severity. Most of these studies suffer from multiple biases, 940 the most concerning of which is patient selection from serum banks within retrospective cohorts, and lack 941 of representativeness of the sample used for analysis. Many of these studies also lack clear comparison to 942 a gold-standard, tended to be conducted only in certain aged samples, and lacked prospective use of an 943 OFC complicating an objective determination of reaction severity. Study of severe reactions is further 944 34 hampered given a predilection to not challenge strongly sensitized individuals with a supporting clinical 945 history, as well as ethical considerations to promptly treat reactions when individuals are challenged, 946 which preclude determining how severe a reaction could be. 947 The cut-off levels chosen for this analysis were based on review of the literature, where we could 948 include the maximal number of studies, and represent realistically large sensitization levels. For reasons 949 discussed previously, we do not report to the lower limit of detection, other levels of sensitization, or 950 attempted to derive a PPV for severe reactivity. 951 Sensitivity Analyses 952 In our protocol we pre-specified sensitivity analyses based on OFC type, geographical region of 953 where the study was conducted, and patient age. We performed additional post-hoc sensitivity analyses 954 for studies that had high risk of bias where both patient selection and flow/timing were noted to be issues. 955 These results are shown in table 3,7, and supplemental figures 2 and 3. 956 Risk of Bias Assessment 957 Risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-2 assessment tool. 33 This noted some instances where 958 high risk was noted pertaining to the studies for either risk of bias or applicability. The results of this are 959 detailed in table 8. Sensitivity analyses for all 3 searchable questions were completed after removing 960 studies judged to have high risk for bias based on patient selection and flow/timing of the testing and 961 challenge but this did not alter the pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates to an appreciable or 962 significant degree. 963 964 Analysis of Health and Economic Benefits of Peanut Diagnostic Strategies: 965 Cost-effectiveness of peanut allergy diagnostic options was evaluated with decision analysis 966 informed by results of the meta-analysis of diagnostic operating characteristics of single ara h 2 sIgE, 967 whole peanut sIgE, and skin prick testing (SPT) (Figures 10 and 11). Markov modeling was used in 968 microsimulations of each testing strategy (n=100,000 per strategy). Model assumptions are outlined in 969 Table 9. Age-adjusted all-cause mortality was included over a 20-year time horizon (sensitivity range 5-970 80 years) with a start age during infancy sensitivity range 0 years to 8 years), a 14% pre-test probability 971 of peanut allergy (sensitivity range 5%-90%) , and an assumption that 20% (sensitivity range of 5%-972 35 20%) of false positive diagnoses were refuted by accidental exposures over the model horizon in the 973 base-case. Costs were expressed in 2019 dollars with future costs and life-years were equally discounted 974 at 3%, and risks of reactions, costs, and utilities of peanut allergy burden of illness were incorporated. 975 In the base-case analysis at a pre-test probability of 14%, Ara h 2 dominated both whole peanut 976 sIgE and whole peanut prick skin testing, producing greater health benefit in terms of quality-adjusted life 977 years (QALY: Ara h 2 14.69, SPT 14.36, SD 1.33; sIgE 14.29, SD 1.33. To illustrate the scale 978 of the metric, a 0.1 difference in QALY represents ~36.5 days of life in a year traded in preference of a 979 specific outcome). Ara h 2 screening produced cost savings of $13,960 and $11,530 when compared 980 with whole peanut sIgE and SPT testing over a 20-year time horizon. Ara h 2 did result in a greater rate 981 of peanut allergic reactions per patient screened (Ara h 2: 0.1725, SD 0.6169; SPT: 0.1555, SD 0.5784; 982 whole peanut sIgE: 0.1581, SD 0.5836) but no significant difference in fatality rates (Table 10). At 983 pretest probabilities of 3% and 75%, Ara h 2 continued to dominate analyses with cost saving (compared 984 with SPT, whole peanut sIgE) of $13,065 (SPT), $15,797 (whole peanut sIgE) and $3,489 (SPT), $4,187 985 (sIgE), respectively. Peanut associated fatality was rare and not significantly different among testing 986 strategies. 987 The analysis remained dominated in deterministic sensitivity analyses (Figure 12) provided Ara h 988 2 specificity remained above 0.46. If all patients with negative testing underwent supervised oral food 989 challenge (14% pre-test probability), cost of Ara h 2 was $12,302 (SD, $22,233), SPT $23,853 (SD, 990 $25,404), whole peanut sIgE $26,334 (SD,$25,359) producing respective benefits of 14.69 (SD, 1.32) 991 QALY for Ara h 2, 14.37 (SD, 1.32) QALY for SPT, and 14.30 (SD, 1.31) QALY for whole peanut sIgE. 992 In probabilistic sensitivity analysis (n=10,000) across fatality distributions demonstrated, the Ara h 2 993 strategy was the most cost-effective option in all iterations (willingness to pay (WTP) of 994 $100,000/QALY).(Figure 13) 995 While we make no recommendation for or against the use of any component testing in question 3, 996 this simulation, does suggest superior health and economic benefits would be associated with preferential 997 use of Ara h 2 as a stand-alone diagnostic test, assuming these are used in populations similar to those 998 pooled for analysis. Limitations of this analysis include a) use of the meta-analysis inputs, which have 999 outcomes assessed at low cut-off values for sensitivity and specificity; b) lack of prospective validation of 1000 OFC proven outcomes when Ara h 2 is the only sensitization marker assessed; c) a knowledge gap in 1001 understanding the association of other component recognition in the absence of Ara h 2 recognition in 1002 36 OFC proven cases of peanut allergy; and d) lack of commercial availability of Ara h 2 as an available 1003 stand-alone test. General limitations of the overall analysis are discussed in the next section. 1004 1005 1006 General Limitations of this Analysis 1007 There are multiple limitations to this analysis. Foremost, we were only able to address 4 questions, 1008 including one that was not searchable, in the scope of this analysis. This does not imply that there are 1009 other factors or issues within peanut allergy diagnostic testing that are less important. The JTFPP did 1010 limit the questions asked to 4, for pragmatic reasons to ensure we could produce a GRADE based 1011 parameter in the timeframe allotted which conformed to the bylaws set forth in 2016 by the AAAAI and 1012 ACAAI. These stated that no new parameter topics will be generated, and that all parameters going 1013 forward offer focused updates to formerly published documents using GRADE format. Therefore, this 1014 document updates the Diagnostic Testing parameter from 2008,11 with a focus on the use of diagnostic 1015 testing for peanut allergy. GRADE is not the only system for evidence-based reviews, but is the chosen 1016 system for the JTFPP. GRADE has multiple noted limitations, including forced downgrading of certainty 1017 and strength of recommendation based on particular study attributes, and a general trend that the overall 1018 strength of recommendations are rarely strong.27-29 Peanut components were not commercially available 1019 before the latter part of the 2000's and thus this may have introduced not-at-random factors about the 1020 types of patients studied in those compared to earlier studies when components were not available. Fairly 1021 low cut-off levels were chosen in the analysis for reasons detailed in the sub-sections, but this remains a 1022 limitation in that the relative precision of the test may perform differently at different levels. 1023 1024 We found a scarcity of available studies in our literature search that we found which met our OFC criteria 1025 and explored use of these tests at a general population level. Therefore, most included studies either 1026 involved a referral center cohort, or in many cases, a referral center cohort enriched for patients with 1027 known sensitization (skin and/or serologic IgE testing) as selection criteria before being offered OFC. In 1028 choosing the selection criteria and evaluating studies for final inclusion, it was felt that this was an 1029 acceptable approach given that the specialist clinician would generally be dealing with issues surrounding 1030 test interpretation in this population, and be less concerned with false negative rates from the general 1031 37 population (which the pooled sensitivity and specificity may mis-estimate in this analysis). We have 1032 accounted for this by downgrading the risk of bias (on account of risk of bias from patient selection) 1033 category in the GRADE certainty of evidence table, which factors into the overall certainty of the 1034 recommendations. Additionally, the analyses involve pooling of studies for assessment of severity that 1035 did not all use the same severity criteria (they were similar enough to pool but the rankings reflected 1036 different criteria that have evolved over time) and most had wide confidence intervals, requiring us to 1037 downgrade 2 points for inconsistency. 1038 1039 The limitations of lack of studies evaluating a tandem or reflexive approach, or the robustness of studies 1040 pertaining to other components beyond Ara h 2 (necessary to allow for meta-analysis) have already been 1041 mentioned, as has the lack of a consistent objective grading criteria as well as the small number of studies 1042 evaluating reaction severity, as well as differences noted in the timing/flow and selection processes of 1043 each of these studies. This is accounted for in grading the certainty of evidence and risk of bias. As well, 1044 the aforementioned sensitivity analyses were done to further confirm if inclusion of those studies felt to 1045 be most at risk would alter the estimates, which they did not. We could not stratify by allergic co-1046 morbidity (in particular presence of atopic dermatitis) or age with accuracy due to limited available data 1047 in the reporting which would allow for such stratifications to be made, though we did perform sensitivity 1048 analysis on challenge type, adult vs. pediatric studies, as well as by region of the world (Europe, North 1049 America) in which the data were observed. Statistically, the pooling of data are limited by high 1050 heterogeneity, with some included studies having high risk of bias. 1051 1052 Knowledge Gaps 1053 Within in the scope of these questions, multiple gaps in the current knowledge base were identified that 1054 could not be resolved through our literature search and meta-analysis. These include, but are not limited 1055 to: 1056 a) A lack of identified studies that systematically evaluate when someone should be tested for peanut 1057 allergy 1058 b) A lack of identified studies that evaluate the tandem or reflexive use of whole peanut extract SPT 1059 and whole peanut sIgE in combination 1060 38 c) A lack of identified studies that evaluate the tandem or reflexive use of whole peanut extract SPT 1061 and whole peanut sIgE in combination with peanut components 1062 d) A lack of identified studies that evaluate the tandem or reflexive use of one or more peanut 1063 components 1064 e) A lack of identified studies that evaluate Ara h 1, Ara h 3, Ara h 6, Ara h 8, and Ara h 9 1065 performance, or if severity or reaction phenotypes are associated with recognition of these 1066 components 1067 f) A lack of identified studies that consistently or systematically study reaction severity using 1068 unified criteria or cut-off markers, or evaluate this question at different cut-off levels 1069 g) A lack of identified studies that study any of the searchable questions at a population level that are 1070 less enriched for already sensitized individuals as opposed to within more clustered clinical 1071 referral centers 1072 h) A lack of identified studies that trace longitudinal outcomes and natural history of disease to 1073 better understand the full scope of the ramifications of diagnostic testing choices to inform best-1074 practices 1075 i) A lack of clear understanding and inconsistent use of diagnostic cut-off points for the use of these 1076 tests 1077 j) A lack of consistent reporting at an individual level of allergic co-factors that may influence the 1078 performance of these diagnostic tests in relation to the food challenge outcome to assess the 1079 influence of such covariates 1080 Text box 2 addresses a number of the key take-home messages and knowledge gaps. 1081 1082 Summary and Conclusions 1083 In making a diagnosis of peanut allergy, it is important to clearly understand the indications for 1084 running a diagnostic test. Only patients with a history of peanut ingestion leading to symptom 1085 development benefit from peanut allergy diagnostic testing, and should be tested.14,15,19 With the 1086 exception of patients who are not newborn infants under the age of 4-6 months of life who have either 1087 egg allergy or severe eczema,17 there is no indication for any form of peanut allergy testing in someone 1088 who has not yet eaten peanut and subsequently developed symptoms of an allergic reaction. Testing only 1089 39 determines the presence or absence of peanut sensitization and alone does not infer a diagnosis without a 1090 history to provide context as to what happens upon peanut ingestion.11 Use of the tests in these contexts 1091 helps translate the pre-test probability of allergy (e.g. based on the history) into post-test odds of a peanut 1092 allergy diagnosis.12 In some cases, an oral food challenge may be necessary to definitively rule in or rule 1093 out a diagnosis. In terms of choice of tests, when assessing for whole peanut sensitization, there is little 1094 practical difference between use of SPT or sIgE\u2014both are highly sensitive but poorly specific, and may 1095 be prone to false positive detection of sensitization in certain contexts. Use of testing to the peanut 1096 component Ara h 2 has the best profile of high sensitivity, high specificity, and optimal positive/negative 1097 likelihood ratio, and is probably the most accurate single test that is available in terms of a test that could 1098 be sent with the lowest potential risk of false positive sensitization being detected. However, how this 1099 test should be used in the work up of the suspected peanut allergic patient remains unresolved and not 1100 prospectively validated in terms of clinical pathways as to how such properties could be leveraged. We 1101 do present evidence herein that shows that using Ara h 2 as a sole diagnostic test in the evaluation of 1102 peanut allergy could be cost effective, given the cost-savings at a societal level associated with a 1103 significant simulated reduction in the number of false positive cases, as one such possible application of 1104 how the test could be used. No whole peanut allergen or component test infers severity of a future 1105 reaction, or a reaction phenotype, and attempts to interpret these tests as such should be discouraged 1106 given no evidence of a relationship. (Table 11) 1107 Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations 1108 Potential Benefits 1109 The potential benefit of this analysis is the appropriate management of patients with Peanut allergy. 1110 See the \"Discussion\" section for each question in the guideline document for benefits of tests. Cost-1111 effectiveness analysis was undertaken to further explore such health benefits. Please refer to 1112 supplemental table 1, which details the evidence to recommendation process. 1113 Potential Harms 1114 The potential harms include adverse effects associated with incorrect diagnosis of peanut allergy. See 1115 the \"Discussion\" section for each question in the guideline document for adverse events of specific 1116 40 interventions. Cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken to further explore such health detriments. 1117 Please refer to supplemental table 1, which details the evidence to recommendation process. 1118 1119 Qualifying Statements 1120 This clinical practice guideline was designed to facilitate informed decision-making on the diagnosis 1121 of children and adults with suspected peanut allergy. It was not intended to define a standard of care, and 1122 should not be construed as such. It should not be interpreted as a prescription for an exclusive course of 1123 management. 1124 Implementation of the Guideline 1125 Description of Implementation Strategy 1126 This practice parameter will be published in XXX, and made available through direct hyperlink on the 1127 Joint Taskforce for Allergy Practice Parameters website. To help promote awareness of this new 1128 practice parameter and enhance knowledge translation, there are planned lectures at forthcoming 1129 national allergy meetings as well as at state/local allergy meetings. 1130 Implementation Tools 1131 A slide deck detailing the key findings in this practice parameter has been developed and is available on 1132 both the AAAAI and the ACAAI websites. 1133 1134 (publication date) #### 1135 Guideline Developer(s) 1136 The Joint Task Force of Practice Parameters 1137 Source(s) of Funding 1138 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, Immunology and the American College of Allergy, Asthma, 1139 and Immunology 1140 41 Financial Disclosures/Conflicts of Interest 1141 All members of the peanut diagnosis workgroup and the JTFPP were required to complete a detailed 1142 declaration of interest statement' including all current and future conflicts of interest as well as past 1143 conflicts of interest restricted to 2 years before joining the workgroup and/or JTFPP. It is felt that 1144 excluding all individuals with some degree of potential conflict of interest would prevent the assembly of 1145 a workgroup and JTFPP. The authors therefore allowed members of the workgroup and JTFPP to have 1146 past financial and/or intellectual conflicts of interest. No consequences were attached to the stated 1147 interests, but rather the authors insisted on transparency. All members of the workgroup and JTF were 1148 allowed to participate in all discussions and had equal weight in formulating the statements. All were 1149 allowed equal involvement in data extraction and writing the rationales. 1150 The declaration of interest forms are available from www.allergyparameters.org and are updated on 1151 a regular basis. 1152 Contributions of authors 1153 (to revise) 1154 1155 1156 References 1157 1.

Pediatr Supplemental Methods for the Analysis of Health and Economic Benefits of Peanut Diagnostic 1396 Strategies: 1397 Cost-effectiveness of peanut allergy diagnostic options was evaluated with decision analysis 1398 informed by results of the meta-analysis of diagnostic operating characteristics of single ara h 2 sIgE, 1399 whole peanut sIgE, and skin prick testing (SPT) (Figure 10). Markov modeling was used in 1400 microsimulations of each testing strategy (n=100,000 per strategy). Model assumptions are outlined in 1401 Table 10. Age-adjusted all-cause mortality was included over a 20-year time horizon (sensitivity range 5-1402 80 years) with a start age during infancy sensitivity range to 8 years), a 14% pre-test probability of 1403 peanut allergy (sensitivity range 5%-90%) , and an assumption that 20% (sensitivity range of 5%-20%) 1404 of false positive diagnoses were refuted by accidental exposures over the model horizon in the base-case. 1405 Future costs and life-years were equally discounted at 3%, and risks of reactions, costs, and utilities of 1406 peanut allergy burden of illness 1: The GRADE System of Recommendations and Evidence Certainty Strength of Recommendation For the Patient For the Clinician Strong Most individuals in this situation would prefer the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not. The attending provider should strongly consider the recommended course of action as a first-line management. Formal decision aids may have less of a role to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences. Conditional The majority of individuals in this situation would prefer the suggested course of action, but many would not. Different choices may be appropriate for different patients. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals in making decisions consistent with their values and preferences. Clinicians should expect to spend more time with patients when working towards a decision. Certainty in estimates of effect / quality rating both for outcome and for an entire evidence base as it pertains to a PICO High There is high confidence that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Moderate There is moderate confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.

Their older sibling has milk, egg, and peanut allergy the older child, leading to additional risk from delayed introduction Some clinicians ascribe to older literature that has suggested the younger sibling may be at some degree of increased risk of developing peanut allergy, though such literature did not account for the highly important factor of delayed introduction. 30% pre-test probability where a positive test was not shown to appreciably shift the post-test odds By NIAID addendum criteria, the eczema does not make this child \"high-risk\" Recent data has shown that testing the younger sibling is not cost effective until the prevalence of peanut allergy in siblings is shown to be >14% AND all such screened children also undergo an oral food challenge to provide a definitive outcome. aSee textbox 3 for explanation of what high, moderate, and low pre-test probability represent in the context of evaluating peanut allergy. bThese are hypothetical examples of situations that the workgroup members felt could represent potential scenarios that a clinician may evaluate under the context of a preference-sensitive care option. The choice of specific allergens, ages, and comorbidities are for illustration purposes only. Other allergens, ages, and comorbidities may represent possible presentations for consideration.

We suggest in favor of diagnostic (skin prick or serum sIgE) testing for peanut allergy in patients with a 1) physician-judged high pre-test probability of peanut allergy, or 2) prior to an oral food challenge for patients with moderate pre-test probability of peanut allergy, with whom shared decision-making has been employed to arrive at the final decision. We suggest against diagnostic testing in patients where there is low or very low pre-test probability of peanut allergy. Very Low Not Rated In the patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy, which of the three tests\u2014SPT, sIgE to whole peanut, or Ara h2 would provide the highest diagnostic accuracy as determined by the more optimal positive/negative likelihood ratio? We suggest in favor of Ara h2 diagnostic testing in a patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy for which a single diagnostic test is to be used, as Ara h2 would provide the best diagnostic accuracy as determined by virtue of more optimal positive/negative likelihood ratios. Moderate High In a patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy, does testing for peanut components in addition to either SPT or sIgE to whole peanut increase the diagnostic accuracy? We suggest against component testing in addition to either to skin prick test or sIgE to whole peanut to increase diagnostic accuracy. Very Low High In the patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy, can the results of a diagnostic test be used to predict the severity of a future allergic reaction? We suggest against the clinician using the results of a SPT, sIgE to whole peanut extract, or sIgE to peanut components to determine the severity of a previous reaction and/or allergy phenotype or to predict the severity of a future reaction. Very Low High Text Box 1: GRADE Questions Evaluated in this Practice Parameter PICO Questions: GRADE Analysis of Diagnostic Testing in the Diagnosis of Peanut Allergy 1. Should diagnostic testing for peanut allergy be performed in adults and children with a history of suspected peanut allergy who are requesting evaluation for peanut allergy? 2a. In the patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy, which of the three tests\u2014SPT, sIgE to whole peanut, or Ara h2 would provide the highest diagnostic accuracy as determined by the more optimal positive/negative likelihood ratio? 2b. In a patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy, does testing for peanut components in addition to either SPT or sIgE to whole peanut increase the diagnostic accuracy? 3. In the patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy, can the results of a diagnostic test be used to predict the severity of a future allergic reaction? Text Box 2: Defining Allergic Sensitization and a \"Positive Test\" Allergic sensitization is denoted by the presence of detectable allergen-specific IgE, either through a serologic assay or through skin prick testing. All tests for sensitization have a threshold where the test is considered to be positive, as well as either a detection limit or a reporting limit. For skin prick testing, the most commonly reported convention for where a test is considered \"positive\" for the presence of allergen specific IgE is when the allergen-specific test is 3mm of wheal diameter greater than that of a simultaneously placed glycerinated saline control. As discussed in the 2008 Diagnostic Testing Practice Parameter (www.allergyparameters.org) different testing devices produce some degree of variation in the size range of negative controls, as does variation related to the tester. Wheal size is recommended to be measured as the average length of the two longest bisecting planes, though many clinics may elect to measure the longest single plane. For serum-specific IgE tests using fluorescent enzymatic immunoassay (FEIA) detection, the instruments have both detection limits and reporting limits that have influenced test results. However, each instrument has particular reporting and detection ranges, and these differ between commercial tests. The technical detection limit for these machines is typically 0.1 KUA/L, and antibody levels above this threshold are reported as they are detected, to an upper reporting limit of 100 KUA/L. Quantification of levels >100 KUA/L is possible through sample dilution. For many years, the reporting limit was conventionally set at < 0.35 KUA/L, though in recent years, this has been replaced by the detection limit of 0.1 KUA/L. Using the older convention of the 0.35 KUA/L reporting limit, \"positive\" sensitization was considered to be 0.36 KUA/L or higher. With the newer convention of using the 0.1 KUA/L detection limit as the reporting limit, \"positive\" sensitization would therefore be 0.11 KUA/L. This creates a conundrum of how to interpret sensitization between 0.11 KUA/L and 0.35 KUA/L, which prior to the change in reporting convention would have fallen into the \"negative\" range. It is debatable that such sensitization is clinically relevant, or that many clinicians would only consider sensitization above 0.7 KUA/L as clinically relevant. Nonetheless, studies may report positive sensitization at 0.11 KUA/L in a binary fashion. One additional classification that is seen are classes representing sextiles of IgE quantity detected between the upper and lower reporting limits. These are arbitrary conventions that date back to the quartiles originally described for Radioallosorbent Testing, adjusted for the FEIA method. Class 0 represents levels below the reporting limit, and class 1 typically starts at the reporting lower limit, ranging to class 6 representing the highest levels detectable which are reported. These class designations have no clinical relevance in and of themselves, and no reference to class designations is made in this document. In this document, if the term positive is used, in relation to either form of test it is in this sense that this refers to positive detection of sensitization (e.g. a positive test). Unequivocally, positive detection of sensitization is unrelated to a positive clinical diagnosis of allergy. A positive diagnosis is predicated on both a demonstrated clinical history of allergy and the presence of detectable sensitization, or in very circumscribed instances, very high levels of sensitization in infants with very particular pre-existing risk factors who have never ingested peanut previously. Text Box 3: Examples of Pre-test Probability in Determining if Diagnostic Testing is Indicted 1. High pre-test probability should be considered as a situation where there was ingestion of peanut and typical IgE mediated symptoms of an allergic reaction resulted, either directly observed or reported; or an infant meeting NIAID early peanut introduction high-risk criteria prior to peanut introduction. Testing is of the highest utility in these scenarios and peanut sensitization above a certain threshold is of high likelihood to be associated with the highest post-test odds of a diagnosis of peanut allergy. 2. Moderate pre-test probability should be considered as a situation where there is less clarity that peanut was ingested and resulted in IgE mediated symptoms, but some consideration for this in explaining an allergic reaction under evaluation. In some instances it may represent situations where the patient has not previously consumed peanut but could be considered at a risk greater than the general population for peanut allergy based on the presence of certain types of other food allergies, certain atopic comorbidities (e.g., severe eczema), or certain children outside the first year of life with delayed peanut introduction. Testing is of unclear utility in these situations, and not necessarily associated with post-test odds that clarify clinical decision making. An oral food challenge may be required to definitively establish a diagnosis when there is peanut sensitization above a certain threshold. 3. Low pre-test probability should be considered a situation where there is very little uncertainty that the person is peanut tolerant (e.g. eats peanut without becoming symptomatic), that peanut was unrelated to the allergic reaction being evaluated (e.g. it is clear that a single allergen other than peanut likely caused the aforementioned reaction and the product was peanut-free, or peanut is being tested solely because it is part of a multi-allergen panel and there is no specific independent concern for peanut allergy itself), family history of peanut allergy or allergic disease, general curiosity about what someone could speculatively be \"allergic to\", or for an infant meeting addendum 2 or 3 criteria for NIAID early peanut introduction guidelines prior to peanut introduction. In some instances it may represent situations where the patient has not previously consumed peanut but the clinician may have concern that the patient is at a risk greater than the general population for peanut allergy based on the presence of certain types of other food allergies or concern for cross-reactivity, certain atopic comorbidities (e.g., mild or moderate eczema), or certain children outside the first year of life with delayed peanut introduction but who have no baseline risk factors. Testing in these situations is of exceptionally limited to no utility whatsoever, is not associated with any shift of post-test odds over baseline, and is not indicated. An oral food challenge is likely required to establish that the peanut sensitization detected is clinically irrelevant. Text Box 4: Key Questions in Peanut Allergy Diagnostic Testing Are there any clinical indications to obtain peanut allergy testing for a patient who is eating peanut without immediate onset or reproducible symptoms? In general, no. However, rare exceptions to this include part of the evaluation of patients with eosinophilic esophagitis where dietary elimination is considered as a treatment option, which is a highly specific context with very particular (non-IgE mediated) symptoms, which is beyond the scope of this document. (Section xx, page xx) Which test should be ordered in the evaluation of patients who have never ingested peanut, i.e. prior to early introduction for at risk infants? Peanut skin prick and serum IgE testing is poorly specific and in general should not be used as a screening tool for someone who has never eaten peanut before and developed symptoms. When used as part of the early introduction guidelines for infants less than 6 months of age who have severe eczema and/or egg allergy, both skin prick and serum peanut IgE tests can be utilized. There is no current role for component testing in this context. (Section xx, page xx) Are there cut-off levels for peanut skin prick or serum IgE testing that diagnoses peanut allergy? A universal cut-off level does not exist. These are technically difficult to generate, given that these are based on accurately knowing the population prevalence of peanut allergy. Cut-off levels are only relative probabilities that are imperfect and have an error rate that will potentially misclassify individuals. When prevalence of disease is not known, the likelihood ratio is a more applicable test. This tells the likelihood of a positive test in someone with the disease compared to the likelihood of a positive test in someone without disease, and can help convert the pre-test probability that someone has the disease to a post-test odds using a Fagan nomogram. Thus, as stand-alone measures, neither skin prick nor serum IgE test results can be interpreted as diagnostic for peanut allergy. (Section xx, page xx) Should peanut allergy testing be considered in children with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis? Atopic dermatitis is caused by changes in the epidermal skin barrier and is generally not due to food allergy, though children with persistent and refractory moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis may be at higher risk of developing food allergy. Peanut allergy testing should not be a standard part of the evaluation for any patient with atopic dermatitis. However, in a very small subset of infants and young children with severe, treatment- refractory atopic dermatitis may benefit from select food allergy, including peanut allergy testing if the clinical history suggests peanut has not yet been introduced, or there is suspicion that peanut ingestion is temporally associated with flares. (Section xx, page xx) Should children with a family history of peanut allergy in another sibling be evaluated for peanut allergy prior to this being introduced? Screening of younger siblings for peanut allergy should not be routinely performed, and there is no evidence that such individuals are at higher risk for developing peanut allergy based just on the sibling history alone. To facilitate timely introduction and prevent delay, there could be consideration for a role for testing when parents are overly anxious about introducing peanut and will not introduce peanut to their child through any other means. However, such testing must be interpreted properly and a positive result not be considered diagnostic for peanut allergy. In these situations, either skin prick or serum IgE testing may be utilized. Data exists to show that this practice is not cost-effective until there is a much higher baseline prevalence of peanut allergy in the population, and then only cost-effective if sensitized children undergo challenge rather than avoid peanut based on strong sensitization. There is no indication to utilize component testing in this context. (Section xx, page xx) Are all patients with detectable Ara h 2 clinically allergic to peanuts? No. Detectable isolated sensitization to Ara h 2 is not diagnostic for peanut allergy, and a diagnosis can only be made where the individual is sensitized in the context of a known or suspected reaction after eating peanut. There are no well-established cut off levels for Ara h 2 at this time that indicate the presence of allergy versus sensitization. However, when compared to whole peanut skin prick and sIgE tests, Ara h 2 testing has vastly increased specificity, though this is still largely dependent on the context in which any testing is indicated. Patients may have detectable Ara h 2 but exhibit no clinical reactivity upon ingestion of peanut. (Section xx, page xx) Does component testing predict the severity of future reactions? No test, including components, has good sensitivity or specificity to indicate the severity of a future reaction. Component testing may have a potential role to help identify sensitization patterns that indicate recognition of cross sensitization with pollen allergens as opposed to more primary allergens unique to peanut, though the clinical significance of this is still to be defined. (Section xx, page xx) When should component testing be ordered as the initial diagnostic test? The role of component testing is evolving, and it is unclear how and when these tests should be used. Comparatively, testing for Ara h 2 compared to whole peanut skin prick and sIgE testing does have significantly higher specificity, which may translate to a lower likelihood of a false positive diagnosis if testing is run the right context. Moreover, in this context, use of Ara h 2 as a stand-alone test is highly cost-effective. However, there is a present knowledge gap if Ara h 2 should be the initial test ordered. (Section xx, page xx) QUESTION In patients presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy, which of the three tests\u2014Skin prick test, sIgE to whole peanut, or Ara h2 would provide the most diagnostic accuracy as determined by the more optimal positive/negative likelihood ratio? POPULATION: Adults and children presenting for evaluation of peanut allergy INTERVENTION: Using peanut skin prick testing (SPT), serum specific IgE to whole peanut (sIgE), or Ara h 2 serum specific IgE (Ara h 2 sIgE) to determine peanut sensitization to assist in the diagnosis peanut allergy COMPARATOR Oral Food challenge OUTCOMES Diagnostic accuracy of peanut allergy testing as determined by the more optimal positive/negative likelihood ratio. PURPOSE OF THE TEST: TO DETECT SENSITIZATION TO PEANUT PROTEIN ROLE OF THE TEST: DETECTABLE OR NON-DETECTABLE SENSITIZATION CAN BE USED TO HELP INCREASE OR DECREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF PEANUT ALLERGY BASED ON THE PRESENTING PATIENT HISTORY LINKED RECOMMENDATIONS AD LIBITUM PEANUT INGESTION, SUPERVISED ORAL FOOD CHALLENGE TO PEANUT, PEANUT AVOIDANCE WITH/WITHOUT TREATMENT ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES: Appropriate selection of the test to improve the likelihood of correct diagnosis SETTING: Patients presenting a to an allergist or a primary care provider for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy PERSPECTIVE: Patients and clinicians want to know the best diagnostic test to perform to help confirm the patients' history of suspected peanut allergy. Clinicians want to know when an oral food challenge should be performed, when it is safe to advise a patient to eat peanut, and when peanut should be avoided due to risk of an allergic reaction and consider seeking treatments BACKGROUND: Peanut allergy affects between 1.4% to 4.5% of the US population. This can be a potentially severe and life-long condition associated with reduced health and economic outcomes. Soon to be approved treatments can offer limited protection to a small amount of peanut but no therapy can cure the condition, but being on treatment still implies the patient is peanut allergic and must otherwise avoid intended peanut ingestion and carry emergency medication. Approximately 20%-34% will outgrow their peanut allergy. With the advent of available treatment options, it is imperative to understand how to use available diagnostic tests and interpret their results to aid in making an accurate diagnosis of peanut allergy. SUBGROUPS: Persons with a severe allergic reaction occurring during an observed oral food challenge; Persons with low, medium, and high pre-test probability of a suspected peanut allergy CONFLICT OF INTERESTS: See main document ASSESSMENT Problem Is the problem a priority?

The FDA has fast-tracked the development of commercial therapies to address the growing prevalence of peanut allergy. Overdiagnosis and unwarranted practice variation can create a significant healthcare burden and family quality of life. All stakeholders desire a fast, reliable diagnostic tool. Test accuracy How accurate is the test? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Very inaccurate Inaccurate Accurate Very accurate Varies Don't know Pooled Sensitivity/Specificity positive/negative likelihood ratio (with 95% CI): Test Sensitivity Specificity Positive Likelihood Negative Likelihood SPT 0.97 (0.93-0.99) Both SPT and whole peanut sIgE have high pooled sensitivity but relatively poor specificity for the diagnosis of peanut allergy proven by oral food challenge. Ara h 2 sIgE has somewhat reduced sensitivity to SPT or sIgE, but has enhanced specificity relative to these tests, and the most optimal positive/negative likelihood ration combination. Despite the individual test precision, the interpretation of the test of choice is highly dependent on an adequate suspicion of significant pre-test probability, reflected by a reasonable history that the patient had ingested peanut and demonstrated symptoms characteristic of an IgE mediated reaction. Using thresholds evaluated in the present meta-analysis, all three tests are suboptimal screening measures due to poor specificity and a high likelihood of detecting asymptomatic sensitization, potentially resulting in a false positive diagnosis. Irrespective of the test used, there are limited situations where a positive result alone relays adequate post-test odds of a peanut allergy diagnosis without the need to do a follow up oral food challenge. Based on the current analysis, in situations of low to moderate pre-test probability, detectable Ara h 2 sIgE translates to higher post-test odds of peanut allergy, compared to SPT and whole peanut sIgE. Where there is moderate to high pre-test probability, choice of test is less likely to influence the post-test odds, as best illustrated by the Fagan nomograms in figures3, 4 and 6. Skin prick testing is the traditional test of choice of the board-certified allergist and otolaryngologist with focused allergy sub-training. It is a point-of-care test that is easy to perform, exceptionally safe, inexpensive, and reliable under contexts where there is a reasonable suspicion for allergy. The advantage of this test is that the clinician can detect if sensitization is present or absent during the visit, though ambient dermatographism can affect interpretation. Serologic tests are usually performed outside of the clinical encounter. In the patient where there is strong clinical suspicion for peanut allergy, detecting sensitization through the SPT at the time of the encounter can help make the diagnosis in real-time, and allow for the patient to be counseled on avoidance and anaphylaxis management. There may be consideration that given the enhanced likelihood ratio combination that Ara h 2 is the most optimal confirmatory test to be sent after detection of sensitization on skin prick testing. Desirable Effects How substantial are the desirable anticipated effects? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Trivial Small Moderate Large In setting of high pre-test probability, detection of peanut sensitization with any of the 3 tests can significantly increase the post-test odds of a peanut allergy diagnosis as shown in Figures 4 and 5. The main advantage to the SPT over serologic IgE tests is that this is a point-of-care test that can help facilitate a diagnosis being made during the encounter. No test is a substitute or surrogate for taking a good history. Varies Don't know Undesirable Effects How substantial are the undesirable anticipated effects? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Large Moderate Small Trivial Varies Don't know In settings of low to moderate pre-test probability, detection of sensitization with any of the three tests still translates to a similar low to moderate post-test odds (figures 3, 4, and 6), and considering these results indicative of peanut allergy may significantly risk a false positive diagnosis. Clinician Vantage: The level of sensitization above the positive threshold cannot be used to predict the risks of a future reaction. Likewise, test sensitization below the positive threshold in the setting of a history suggestive of high risk, cannot exclude peanut allergy. Test results, whether positive or negative, may still require an oral food challenge be performed to clarify the diagnosis Patient vantage: patients may have variable preferences regarding having a false positive diagnosis than a false negative diagnosis, and therefore patients may prefer an oral food challenge after the test results are known, in particular when considering entering into possible treatment for peanut allergy The clinician should be aware of the role for shared decision making and the need for decision-aids to help patients consider their options and to make the most appropriate decisions. Certainty of the evidence of test accuracy What is the overall certainty of the evidence of test accuracy? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Very low Low Moderate High No included studies 18 studies were pooled for evidence synthesis for use of SPT at a threshold of 3mm, with sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 46%. 30 studies were pooled for evidence synthesis for peanut sIgE at a threshold of >0.35 KUA/L, with sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 38%. 24 studies were pooled for Ara h 2 sIgE >0.35 KUA/L, with sensitivity of 0.86 and specificity of 0.84. There was high heterogeneity among the pooled studies, and serious risk of bias, but no serious risk of indirectness, imprecision, or inconsistency. Sensitivity analysis where studies with high risk for both patient selection and flow/timing were removed had similar pooled sensitivity and specificity for all three tests. Overall there is moderate certainty in the evidence for each of the 3 tests. (Please see tables 4 and 5). Where there is high pre-test probability, detection of peanut sensitization using any of the 3 tests can greatly increase the post-test odds of a peanut allergy diagnosis. Absence of sensitization in such patients can be helpful in lowering the odds that peanut allergy is present. The choice of which test to use is also not crucial in this setting. The Fagan nomograms in figures 4 and 5 demonstrate how the likelihood ratios translate to post-test odds in these situations, and based on these post-test odds some clinicians may feel an oral food challenge is still necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Ara h 2 may perform better than SPT or sIgE where the pre-test probability is low to moderate, but is unlikely to allow the clinician and patient to be provided with the degree of certainty to where an oral food challenge would be unnecessary to confirm a diagnosis. Certainty of the evidence of test's effects What is the overall certainty of the evidence for any critical or important direct benefits, adverse effects or burden of the test? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Very low Low Moderate There are no included studies that detail the overall certainty or importance of direct benefits, adverse effects or burden of the tests. Please refer to the explanation in the above box. While one may question why patients with low suspicion for peanut allergy require testing, there may be a role for shared decision making High No included studies where the risks and benefits of potential overdiagnosis vs. misdiagnosis are clearly explained, given some patients may clearly prefer a test be run, notwithstanding the pre-test probability. Certainty of the evidence of management's effects What is the overall certainty of the evidence of effects of the management that is guided by the test results? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Very low Low Moderate High No included studies Identification of the trigger of a previous episode of anaphylaxis can lead to a reduction in the risk of future anaphylactic events. Treatment options based on a positive diagnosis of peanut allergy include avoidance and carriage of epinephrine. Additionally, for some patients there may be an opportunity for treatments that desensitize the patient to the point of being able to tolerate a low threshold dose of peanut. However, we have very low certainty in the evidence that by making a diagnosis of peanut allergy that the above described options provide an unequivocal benefit for the patient.

Certainty of the evidence of test result/management How certain is the link between test results and management decisions? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Very low Low Moderate High No included studies As reflected in the Fagan nomograms in figures 3, 4, and 6, an oral food challenge may often still be necessary to provide a definitive diagnosis and management strategy despite a positive test result, given that the systematic review suggests that even with very high pre-test probability, the post-test odds do not eclipse 90% (coming closest for the use of Ara h 2). Moreover, even with no detectable sensitization, the post-test odds are still 2-3%. Certainty of effects What is the overall certainty of the evidence of effects of the test? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Very low Low Moderate High No included studies All three of the diagnostic tests for peanut allergy have high sensitivity though detection of peanut specific IgE does not always translate in to post-test odds sufficient enough to support a diagnosis of peanut allergy without a confirmatory oral food challenge. Conversely, the absence of detectable sensitization using any of these three tests should translate to very low post-test odds of a diagnosis of peanut allergy. Therefore, despite which test is used, in many cases an oral food challenge will still be indicated, and thus there is low certainty in the effects of the test in providing benefit for the patient from this perspective. Once a diagnosis is made through either testing or oral food challenge, there is low certainty in the benefits of the available treatment options. Chu DK, Wood RA, French S, et al.

The use of these diagnostic tests at the stated thresholds (SPT 3 mm or greater, sIgE >0.35 KUA/L, Ara h 2 > 2 KUA/L) is most helpful in situations of high (>70%) pre-test probability in shifting the post-test odds appreciably, and can provide moderate to high certainty of a diagnosis. Testing should be undertaken with extreme caution in patients with low pre-test probability. Values Is there important uncertainty about or variability in how much people value the main outcomes? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Important uncertainty or variability Possibly important uncertainty or variability Probably no important uncertainty or variability No important uncertainty or variability Quality of life and qualitative research has indicated a negative effect based upon a poor understanding of the implications of diagnostic testing in terms of the severity and prognosis of the patient's allergy.

Both patients and clinicians highly value an accurate diagnosis, but may be concerned about the undesirable effects highlighted above. There is emerging evidence that uncertainty of what diagnostic test results imply at the time of diagnosis may have detrimental effects on patients and their families. There are no published data on the values and preferences of patients and families regarding performing diagnostic testing for food allergy. Specifically there are no data regarding the potential harms of a false-positive test result as compared with the potential harms of a missed diagnosis (false-negative test result), or how the future implications of the erroneous diagnosis may be handled. This could encompass a scenario where a false negative test results in no diagnosis being given, but the individual later eats a peanut containing item and has a reaction, or alternatively (and more likely), the scenario of someone diagnosed as peanut allergic based on positive testing (without a history of ingestion), who later \"outgrows\" the allergy and may be resentful of the possibility of a false positive diagnosis. Balance of effects Does the balance between desirable and undesirable effects favor the intervention or the comparison? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Favors the comparison Probably favors the comparison Does not favor either the intervention or the comparison Probably favors the intervention Favors the intervention Varies Don't know The oral food challenge is the most accurate, definitive assessment of peanut allergy. However, in situations where there is high pre-test probability for peanut allergy, the three diagnostic tests can greatly assist in increasing (sensitization detected) or significantly decreasing (no sensitization detected) the post-test odds of having peanut allergy, and confirmatory oral food challenge may not always be required. Outside of a strong stated preference where there is low pre-test probability, the comparator test (oral food challenge) has more desirable effects than the intervention diagnostic tests, and can be used to avoid diagnostic misclassification.

Particularly at young ages, over-diagnosis by isolated positive tests of sensitization may also lead to a lost opportunity to establish peanut tolerance. Resources required How large are the resource requirements (costs)? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Large costs Moderate costs Negligible costs and savings Moderate savings Large savings Varies Don't know There are no studies that directly investigated the resources requirements All the possible interventions and the comparator tests do require resources in terms of both direct and indirect costs. These costs and cost burdens may vary depending on the healthcare system in question but are likely already nested into the cost of normal practice operation. Newer management options based on test results may have additional costs that have not been studied. Costs may vary based on the particular healthcare system and geography but these largely fall into overlapping ranges across the US. Skin testing (CPT code 95004) may have more variability in terms of cost and reimbursement than serologic IgE testing (CPT code 86003) based on a selected sample of US cities in different parts of the country, detailed below: Lebanon, NH: 95004 code $8-25; 86003 code $15-$98 Certainty of evidence of required resources What is the certainty of the evidence of resource requirements (costs)? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Very low Low Moderate High No included studies There are no studies that directly assessed the certainty of evidence of resource requirement. There would not be any anticipated new resources needed to support the use of any of these tests that are not already established and in use in clinical practice. There may be additional resources required to offer Ara h 2 as a stand-alone test, as opposed to a full component panel. Initially more expensive but then cheaper later. Operating costs vary from region to region and depend on practice location, personnel experience, and practice volume. While 95% of practicing allergists offer oral food challenges, only 17% perform more than 10 per month, which could complicate access to confirm diagnostic test results. Cost effectiveness Does the cost-effectiveness of the intervention favor the intervention or the comparison? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Favors the comparison Probably favors the comparison Does not favor either the intervention or the comparison Probably favors the intervention Favors the intervention Varies No included studies The cost-effectiveness of diagnostic testing varies based on which test is chosen. A cost-benefit analysis as part of this document shows that use of skin prick testing as opposed to use of Ara h 2 testing is not cost-effective and is associated with higher societal costs related to the risk of false positive results, leading to a patient who is not truly peanut allergic being managed as such. Skin prick testing remains associated with higher costs and lower benefits as a choice of test (e.g. \"dominated\" in economic terms) in the analysis until the specificity of Ara h 2 decreases significantly from the values identified in the meta-analysis. Deterministic sensitivity analysis did not reveal other factors related to assessing a patient for peanut allergy with diagnostic testing, that, if changed, could make this test more cost-effective than Ara h 2. Skin prick testing to peanut has lower specificity than Ara h 2 testing, and will result in more falsely positive diagnoses identified, resulting in lower QALY accumulation. However, with the marginal increase in sensitivity, SPT would result in a slightly lower rate of peanut allergic reactions. Equity What would be the impact on health equity? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Reduced Probably reduced Probably no impact Probably increased Increased Varies Don't know There are no studies that directly assessed the impact on equity. Serologic testing is more widely available and less dependent on allergy specialists which may improve equity potentially, whereas skin testing is the opposite. Certain states have different reimbursement rules/rates for skin vs. serologic testing, which could reduce equity if certain of these tests are not available, based on location or insurance. Acceptability Is the intervention acceptable to key stakeholders? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS No Probably no Probably yes Yes Varies Don't know There are not studies that directly assess if the intervention is acceptable to key stakeholders Clinician vantage: Multiple prior practice parameters have echoed these findings; however, there is well-known practice variation with respect to indication for testing, and interpretation of tests in certain contexts. The clinician may not accept or follow guidelines that advise against their current practices, their training, or their comfort level with decision-making. Patient/Advocate Vantage: patients may have variable preferences regarding how diagnostic testing is used, and as stated above may differentially value having a false positive diagnosis than a false negative diagnosis, or having to undergo an oral challenge to confirm a diagnosis. There could be a role for shared decision making and a decision-aid to help patients consider their options. Feasibility Is the intervention feasible to implement? JUDGEMENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS No Probably no Probably yes Yes Varies Don't know There are no studies that evaluated the feasibility of implementing these findings. This should be feasible to implement but implementation could be limited by lack of availability of Ara h 2 as a stand-alone test. Variable reimbursement of allergy testing services may also limit access to care and implementation. An even more problematic implementation would be if there are sufficient resources at all allergy practices to support an increased need for subsequent oral food challenge to confirm diagnosis when indicated. Not all allergy practices offer oral food challenges and most primary care providers would not be conducting oral food challenges.

Conditional recommendation; Certainty of evidence: very low Recommendation 1b: We suggest against diagnostic testing in patients with a low or very low pre-test probability of peanut allergy. Conditional recommendation; Certainty of evidence: very low Recommendation 2a: We suggest in favor of Ara h2 diagnostic testing in a patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy for which a single diagnostic test is to be used, as Ara h2 would provide the best diagnostic accuracy as determined by the more optimal positive/negative likelihood ratio. Conditional recommendation. Certainty of evidence: moderate Recommendation 2b: We suggest against component testing in addition to either skin prick test or sIgE to whole peanut to increase diagnostic accuracy. Conditional recommendation. Certainty of evidence: moderate. Recommendation 3: We suggest against the clinician using the results of a SPT, sIgE to whole peanut extract, or sIgE to peanut components to determine the severity of a previous reaction and/or allergy phenotype or to predict the severity of a future reaction, Conditional recommendation. Certainty of evidence: very low. Technical remarks: It is critical to consider diagnostic test performance in the context of the pre-test probability of peanut allergy. The clinician should recognize the circumstances where one or more of the peanut diagnostic tests may not translate to a clinically meaningful improved post-test odds of peanut allergy. Except in cases of high pre-test probability, it is likely that an oral food challenge will be needed to establish the diagnosis of peanut allergy, regardless of the results of the selected diagnosis test(s). Certain tests may be more appropriate than others in particular situations. We suggest that the choice of SPT, sIgE, or Ara h 2 sIgE is not critical in circumstances where there is high pre-test probability of peanut allergy. While testing of patients with low pre-test probability is not generally recommended, if the decision is made to test in these circumstances, from a test precision standpoint, use of Ara h 2 rather than SPT or sIgE can help decrease misclassification of patients as peanut allergic, leading to less harm through falsely positive diagnosis. When testing individuals with low pre-test probability, it is recommended that an oral food challenge still be performed to validate the clinical significance of the detection of sensitization, given that the low pre-test probability in the setting of detectable sensitization translates to only moderate post-test odds of a diagnosis. Justification Overall justification In patients with a high pre-test probability for peanut allergy, SPT, sIgE, and Ara h 2 sIgE are highly sensitive and reliable tests that can be considered for routine use in the diagnosis of peanut allergy. Detailed justification Test accuracy These are tests with high sensitivity Desirable Effects Detection of sensitization in an individual with likely or suspected peanut allergy will aid considerably in confirming the diagnosis. Choice of test in circumstances where there is high pre-test probability is not critical. The absence of sensitization is helpful in ruling out the diagnosis (although in many cases, oral food challenge will still be necessary). Subgroup considerations Severity of reaction was investigated as a potential subgroup. These tests do not perform well to identify individuals for potentially severe reactions at the dichotomous thresholds investigated. Data are limited that may better inform if these tests have higher or lower value within other particular subgroups. In infants meeting high-risk criteria for early peanut introduction, SPT is often used; however, incorporation of Ara h 2 might result in a lower rate of over-diagnosis. Unfortunately, evidence comparing these tests is this particular population is lacking. Implementation considerations These are tests that are already in routine use or routinely available for use; however, testing for Ara h 2 as a single component would be needed to implement routine use of this test. In many instances, the clinician is already using these tests in tandem, potentially. If the clinician starts with the SPT in the office setting, using the Fagan nomogram in figure 3, the post-test odds could then reasonably be used as the pre-test odds for choice of a confirmatory test, represented by figure 3 for sIgE or figure 6 for Ara h 2. In this setting, given higher specificity and higher positive likelihood ratio, Ara h 2 may be the better choice of a confirmatory test if it could be obtained as a stand-alone measure. Monitoring and evaluation Additional meta-analysis at different cut-off points may help inform decision making, in particular for the severity subgroup or use of tests in sequence/tandem. We would recommend to journal editors that there be a requirement for future reporting of studies investigating diagnostic test precision in relation to food challenge outcome that raw data be included as a supplemental text denoting the challenge outcome, the numeric quantity of the test, the sequence of testing run if multiple tests were assessed simultaneously, and any data on severity of the reaction. This would allow for a repository to be created that would greatly assist with updating practice guidelines. For study authors to make such deidentified data available, it would enable more direct assessment of test performance as a continuous variable, which would allow for different diagnostic thresholds could be directly assessed and compared for the purposes of meta-analysis and systematic review, as opposed to having to rely on dichotomous assessment of pre-selected thresholds and potential back calculation of sensitivity/specificity. These factors serve as distinct limitations with regard to this particular document. Research priorities Additional studies in more unselected populations, and at a population level are needed. Future research studies reporting diagnostic sensitivity and specificity should report the true/false positive and true/false negative patient level results to assist in future meta-analyses where cut off levels would be easier to assess. If these data were available, it would have permitted analysis of the sensitization levels as a continuous variable rather than a dichotomous variable and potentially allowed better comparison of tests used sequentially or in tandem. Better data are needed to help inform what defines low, moderate, or high pre-test probability in a patient being assessed for possible peanut allergy, as well as to understand how clinicians and patients may perceive risk.
