Plus PPO Plan UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus PPO Plan Section 1 Plan Provisions This document constitutes the entire 2012 UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus PPO Plan (Plan) for City of Austin (City) eligible employees, retirees, COBRA participants, eligible dependents, Surviving Spouses, or Surviving Family Members and, if applicable, employees and retirees of an Affiliated Employer and their eligible dependents. This Plan will refer to the primary insured (i.e., employee, retiree, COBRA participant, Surviving Spouse and Surviving Family Member) as \"Employee.\" The Plan does not constitute a contract of employment. 1.1 P URPOSE The City has contracted with United HealthCare Services, Inc. (UnitedHealthcare) , a private healthcare claims administrator, to administer this Plan and process the payment or reimbursement of specified expenses incurred by eligible Covered Persons. The purpose of this document is to set forth provisions of the Plan that provide and/or affect payment or reimbursement. The Plan is intended to comply with all applicable laws and shall be interpreted accordingly. This plan document is hereby designated as the UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus PPO Plan for City Employees, and the provisions contained in this Plan will be the basis for the administration of the benefits program described in this document. 1.2 A MENDMENT TO OR TERMINATION OF THE PLAN The Plan may be amended, canceled, or discontinued at any time by the City Manager without the consent of or prior notice to any Covered Person. In the event of an amendment or termination of the Plan, written notice will be provided to covered Employees. Such amendment or termination will become effective on the date set forth in such notice. 1.3 E FFECTIVE DATE OF PLAN The Effective Date of the Plan, as amended in its entirety, is January 1, 2012. As of the Effective Date of the Plan, eligibility for and the amount of benefits, if any, payable with respect to Covered Persons, are determined pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Plan. 1.4 B ENEFITS GUIDE It is intended that each Employee eligible for coverage under this Plan shall be issued a Guide, which includes a summary of Plan provisions. However, this document at all times governs and controls in the case of any conflict. 1.5 M ISSTATEMENT ON APPLICATION If any relevant fact has been misstated by or on behalf of any person to obtain coverage under the Plan, the true facts will be used to determine whether coverage is in force and the extent, if any, of such coverage. Upon the discovery of such misstatement, equitable adjustment of any contributions or benefits paid will be made and such persons shall lose coverage under the Plan subject to the Time Limit for Misstatement. 1.6 T IME LIMIT FOR MISSTATEMENT The City will provide written notice to the Employee that coverage has ended on the date the City identifies fraud or misrepresentation, or because the Employee knowingly provided false material information. Examples include false information relating to eligibility or status as a Covered Person.

After the first two years, the Plan Administrator can demand that you pay back these Benefits only if the written application contained a fraudulent misstatement. 1.7 A PPLICABLE LAW Any provision of the Plan, which, as of the Effective Date, is in conflict with the law or regulation of any governmental body or agency that has jurisdiction over the Plan, will be interpreted to conform to the minimum requirements of such law. 1.8 E RROR /DELAY Errors made on the records of the City and delays in making entries on such records will not invalidate coverage or cause coverage to be in force or to continue in force. Rather, the Effective Date of coverage will be determined solely in accordance with the provisions of the Plan regardless of whether any contributions with respect to Covered Persons have been made or have failed to be made because of such errors or delays. Upon discovery of any such error or delay, an adjustment will be made to reflect the correct amount of the contributions. The City has the right to collect contributions owed by the Employee. Conversely, the Employee will be reimbursed if an overpayment occurs. If an overpayment occurs due to an error the Employee makes when completing an application for coverage, the City will reimburse the Employee up to a maximum of 31 days of premiums. 1.9 W AIVER The failure to strictly enforce any provision of the Plan will not be construed as a waiver of the provision. Rather, the right is reserved to strictly enforce each and every provision of the Plan at any time regardless of prior conduct and regardless of the similarity of the circumstances or the number of prior occurrences. 1.10 W RITTEN NOTICE Any written notice required under the Plan will be deemed received if sent by regular mail, postage prepaid, to the last address on the records of the City, or if distributed with paychecks. 1.11 E FFECT OF CHANGES All changes to the Plan will become effective as of a date established by the City Manager, except that no reduction in Plan paid benefits will be effective with respect to Covered Expenses incurred prior to the date the change was effective. 1.12 E NTIRE CONTRACT The Plan and the applications of the Covered Persons, if any, constitute the entire contract of Coverage under the Plan between the City, the Plan Administrator, and the Covered Persons. 1.13 I NTERPRETATION OF BENEFITS The Plan Administrator has the sole and exclusive discretion to do all of the following: 1. Interpret Benefits under the Plan. 2. Interpret the other terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions set out in the Plan Document. 3.

Section 3 How the Plan Works 3.1 PROVIDER INFORMATION You are entitled to medical care and services from Participating Providers including Medically Appropriate medical, surgical, diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive services that are generally and customarily provided in the Service Area. Some services may not be covered. To be covered, a service that is Medically Appropriate must also be described in Covered Services and Benefits. Even though a Physician or other Health Care Professional has performed, prescribed, or recommended a service does not mean it is Medically Appropriate or that it is covered under Covered Services and Benefits. Some Covered Services may also require Pre-Notification to UnitedHealthcare. 3.2 C ONTINUITY OF CARE If you are under the care of a Participating Provider who stops participating in UnitedHealthcare's network, UnitedHealthcare will continue coverage for that Provider's Covered Services if all the following conditions are met: 1. You have a disability, acute condition, life threatening illness, or are past the 24th week of pregnancy. 2. The Provider submits a written request to UnitedHealthcare to continue coverage of your care that identifies the condition for which you are being treated and indicates that the Provider reasonably believes that discontinuing treatment could cause you harm. 3. The Provider agrees to continue accepting the same reimbursement that applied when participating in UnitedHealthcare's network, and not to seek payment from you for any amounts for which you would not be responsible if the Provider were still participating in UnitedHealthcare's network. Continuity coverage shall not extend for more than 90 days (or more than nine months if you have been diagnosed with a terminal illness) beyond the date the Provider's termination takes effect. If you are past the 24th week of pregnancy when the Provider's termination takes effect, coverage may be extended through delivery, immediate postpartum care, and the follow-up check-up within the first six weeks of delivery. 3.3 A VAILABILITY OF PROVIDERS UnitedHealthcare cannot guarantee the availability or continued participation of a particular Provider. Either UnitedHealthcare or any Participating Provider may terminate the Provider contract or limit the number of Members that will be accepted as patients. 3.4 I N-NETWORK AND OUT-OF-NETWORK BENEFITS The level of benefits for Covered Persons depends on whether services are provided by an In-Network or Out-of-Network Provider, and according to the Schedule of Benefits. When In-Network Providers are not available to perform certain services, Covered Services received from Out-of-Network Providers are payable at the In-Network level. Services must be Job Name: 22216 UHG AUSTIN PPO 275-6750 PDF Page: 275-6750 2012 Date: 11-12-13 Time: 07:58:55 Operator: ____________________________PageMark-BW-Comp OK to proceed Make corrections and proceed Make corrections and show another proof Signed: ___________________ Date: ______ 9 2012 UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus PPO Plan Pre-approved by the Plan Administrator. Services not Pre-approved will be payable at the Out-of-Network level. When you receive Covered Services from In-Network Providers, you are not responsible for any difference between the eligible expenses and the amount the Provider bills. When you receive Covered Services from Out-of-Network Providers, you will be responsible for paying any difference between the amount the Provider bills you and the amount the Plan pays for eligible expenses. 3.5 N ON-RESIDENT BENEFITS Covered Persons who are determined by the City and UnitedHealthcare to live outside a UnitedHealthcare service area are called Non-Residents. Covered Services for Non-Residents will be reimbursed at the In-Network benefit level. 3.6 N ETWORK PROVIDER NOT AVAILABLE If it is determined that a network Provider is not available to meet the needs of a Covered Person, the services of a non-network Provider will be reimbursed at the in-network level. You may obtain Covered Services from Providers who are not part of UnitedHealthcare's network of Participating Providers when receiving Emergency Care. Also, court-ordered Dependents living outside the Service Area may use non-Participating Providers. If Covered Services are not available from Participating Providers within the UnitedHealthcare service area, UnitedHealthcare will allow you to use a non-Participating Provider, if approved by UnitedHealthcare. To receive services from a non-Participating Provider the following procedures will apply: 1. Reasonably requested documentation must be received by UnitedHealthcare. 2. The approval will be provided within an appropriate time, not to exceed five business days, based on the circumstances and your condition. 3. When UnitedHealthcare approves services by a non-Participating Provider, UnitedHealthcare will reimburse the non-Participating Provider at the Allowable Amount or otherwise agreed rate, less the applicable Copay(s). You are responsible only for the Copays for such Covered Services. 3.7 I NDIVIDUAL DEDUCTIBLE The Individual Deductible listed on the Schedule of Benefits must be met by each Covered Person, each Calendar Year, before Coinsurance benefits are payable under the Plan. Only eligible expenses may be used to meet the Individual Deductible. The Plan Administrator may allocate the Individual Deductible to any Covered Expenses and to apportion the benefits to the Covered Person and any assignees. In the event a Covered Person is confined for an Inpatient Admission on December 31, expenses for that Inpatient Admission are not subject to the Individual Deductible for the following year. Covered Expenses applied toward the In-Network Individual Deductible will not apply toward the Out-of-Network Individual Deductible. Covered Expenses applied toward the Out-of-Network Individual Deductible will apply toward the In-Network Individual Deductible. Amounts paid toward the individual Deductible for Covered Expenses that are subject to a visit or day limit will also be calculated against that maximum benefit limit. As a result, the limited benefit will be reduced by the number of days or visits you used toward meeting the individual Deductible.

The Family Deductible Maximum also applies when both Spouses are Employees who are covered under the Plan. Once the Family Deductible Maximum has been met, claims already submitted by additional family members that were applied to their individual Deductibles may be eligible for payment. If you contact the Plan Administrator, adjustments can be made on Deductibles applied to such expenses. In the event that two or more covered family members are injured in the same accident, only one individual Deductible is applied in any Calendar Year to the Covered Expenses directly resulting from injuries sustained in that accident. 3.9 A NNUAL OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUM The maximum amount a Covered Person is required to pay in Out-of-Pocket Covered Expenses in any Calendar Year is dependent on whether the Out-of-Pocket Covered Expense is a result of charges incurred In-Network or Out-of-Network. Covered Expenses applied toward the In-Network Out-of-Pocket Maximum will not apply toward the Out-of-Network Out-of-Pocket Maximum. Covered Expenses applied toward the Out-of-Network Out-of-Pocket Maximum will apply toward the In-Network Out-of-Pocket Maximum. 1. In-Network: After a Covered Person incurs $2,500 in Out-of-Pocket Covered Expenses in any Calendar Year resulting from charges incurred In-Network or Out-of-Network, benefits for all other In-Network Covered Expenses incurred during the Calendar Year will be payable at 100% for the remainder of that Calendar Year. a. Out-of-Pocket Covered Expenses include: 1) The Covered Person's Deductible incurred In-Network or Out-of-Network. 2) Coinsurance paid by the Covered Person for Covered Expenses incurred In-Network or Out-of-Network. b. Out-of-Pocket Covered Expenses do not include: 1) Copays paid for Medical Benefits or Prescription Drug Benefits. 2) Outpatient Facility Charges. 3) Any fee beyond the Maximum Allowable Charge for a particular service or supply. 2. Out-of-Network: After a Covered Person incurs $12,000 in Out-of-Pocket Covered Expenses in any Calendar Year resulting from charges incurred Out-of-Network, benefits for all other Covered Expenses incurred during the Calendar Year will be payable at 100% for the remainder of that Calendar Year. a.

Participating Providers may regard such refusal to accept their recommendations as incompatible with continuance of the Provider-patient relationship and as obstructing the provision of proper medical care. Participating Providers shall use their best efforts to render all necessary and appropriate Professional Services in a manner compatible with your wishes, insofar as this can be done consistent with the Participating Provider's judgment as to the requirements of proper medical practice. If you refuse to follow a recommended treatment or procedure, and the Participating Provider informed you of his or her belief that no professionally acceptable alternative exists, neither UnitedHealthcare nor any Participating Provider shall have any further responsibility to provide care for the condition under treatment. 3.13 M EMBER COMPLAINT PROCEDURE Any problem or claim between you and UnitedHealthcare or between you and a Participating Provider must be dealt with using the process described in Complaint and Appeal Procedures (Section 12).

Section 9 Coordination of Benefits 9.1 EFFECT OF COVERAGE UNDER OTHER PLANS This coordination of benefits (COB) provision applies when a person has health coverage under more than one Plan. When this Plan is secondary, payment determination will be made after the Plan Administrator receives an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from the Primary Plan. First, this Plan will determine its obligation to pay or provide benefits without regard to any other Plan (what this Plan would pay if there were no other coverage). If there is a patient responsibility under the Primary Plan, then this Plan will reimburse that responsibility not to exceed the amount this Plan would have paid in the absence of other coverage. 9.2 O RDER OF BENEFITS Other Plan benefits will be ignored for the purposes of determining the benefits payable by the Plan if the rules set forth in the paragraphs below require this Plan to determine its benefits before such Other Plan. The services due or the benefits payable under this Plan will be reduced in accordance with the following: 1. When the Other Plan does not have a Coordination of Benefits provision, the Other Plan is primary. 2. When the Other Plan does have a Coordination of Benefits provision, the following rules govern: a. The plan that covers the Covered Person as an employee must determine its benefits first. b. If (2)(a) does not apply, the plan which covers the dependent child of the parent who is born earlier in the year (year of birth is not taken into account) will determine its benefits first, EXCEPT that when a claim is made for a dependent child of divorced or separated parents, the following rules will apply: 1) A plan that covers a child as a dependent of a parent who, by court order must provide health coverage, will determine its benefits first. 2) When there is no court order which requires a parent to provide health coverage to a dependent child, the following rules apply: A. When a parent who has custody of the child has not remarried, the custodial parent's plan will determine its benefits first. B. When a parent who has custody of the child has remarried: I. The custodial parent's plan will determine its benefits first. II. The stepparent's plan will determine its benefits next. III. The plan of the parent without custody will determine its benefits third. C. If none of the above rules apply, the plan that has covered the dependent child for a longer period of time will determine its benefits first.

Where part of the Other Plan coordinates benefits and a part does not, each part will be treated as a separate plan. 4.

When the above provisions operate to reduce the total amount of benefits otherwise payable on behalf of a Covered Person under this Plan during any Claim Determination Period, each benefit that would be payable in the absence of this provision will be reduced proportionately, and such reduced amount will be charged against any applicable benefit maximum of this Plan. 9.3 R IGHT TO RECEIVE AND RELEASE INFORMATION For the purpose of determining the applicability of and implementing the terms of Section 10.1, Effect of Coverage under Other Plans, and Section 10.2, Order of Benefits, of this Plan or a similar provision of any Other Plan, the Plan Administrator may release to, or obtain from, any other insurance company or other organization or individual, any information concerning any individual, which the Plan Administrator considers to be necessary for those purposes.

Amounts paid in this manner will be considered to be benefits paid under this Plan and, to the extent of these payments, the Plan Administrator and the City will be fully discharged from liability under this Plan. 9.5 S UBROGATION (THIRD PARTY RECOVERY ) The Plan will be subrogated to , and shall succeed to, any and all rights of recovery from any or all third party parties, under any legal theory of any type, for 100 percent of any services and Benefits the Plan has paid on the Covered Person's behalf relating to any condition, Illness, or Injury caused by such third party or for which any third party may be liable.

The Plan Administrator may, at that time or any time, instruct the Covered Person not to seek, or to discontinue seeking, payment or reimbursement on behalf of the Plan, and the Plan Administrator may pursue such payment or reimbursement independently in the same or in a separate lawsuit or other proceeding or may abandon such payment or reimbursement altogether, in its sole discretion. The following persons and entities are considered third parties: 1. a person or entity alleged to have caused you to suffer a Sickness, Injury or damages, or who is legally responsible for the Sickness, Injury or damages; 2. any insurer or other indemnifier of any person or entity alleged to have caused or who caused the Sickness, Injury or damages; 3. The City in workers' compensation cases; or 4. any person or entity who is or may be obligated to provide you with benefits or payments under: a. underinsured or uninsured motorist insurance; b. medical provisions of no-fault or traditional insurance (auto, homeowners or otherwise); c. workers' compensation coverage; or d. any other insurance carrier or third party administrator. As a Covered Person, you agree to the following: 1. the Plan has a first priority right to receive payment on any claim against a third party before you receive payment from that third party. Further, the Plan's first priority right to payment is superior to any and all claims, debts or liens asserted by any medical providers, including but not limited to hospitals or emergency treatment facilities, that assert a right to payment from funds you recover from a third party. 2. the Plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights apply to full and partial settlements, judgments, or other recoveries paid or payable to you or your representative, no matter how those proceeds are captioned or characterized. Payments include, but are not limited to, economic, non-economic, and punitive damages. The Plan is not required to help you to pursue your claim for damages or personal injuries, or pay any of your associated costs, including attorneys' fees. No so-called \"Fund Doctrine\" or \"Common Fund Doctrine\" or \"Attorney's Fund Doctrine\" shall defeat this right. 3. regardless of whether you have been fully compensated or made whole, the Plan may collect from you the proceeds of any full or partial recovery that you or your legal representative obtain, whether in the form of a settlement (either before or after any determination of liability) or judgment, no matter how those proceeds are captioned or characterized.

You agree that you will serve as a trustee over those funds to the extent of the Benefits the Plan has paid. 7. if the Plan incurs attorneys' fees and costs in order to collect third party settlement funds held by you or your representative, the Plan has the right to recover those fees and costs from you. 8. you may not accept any settlement that does not fully reimburse the Plan, without its written approval. 9. upon the Plan's request, you will assign to the Plan all rights of recovery against third parties to the extent of Benefits the Plan has provided for a Sickness or Injury caused by a third party. 10. the Plan's rights will not be reduced due to your own negligence. 11. the Plan may, at its option, take necessary and appropriate action to assert its rights under this section, including filing suit in your name, which does not obligate it in any way to pay you part of any recovery the Plan might obtain. 12. the provisions of this section apply to the parents, guardian, or other representative of a Dependent child who incurs a Sickness or Injury caused by a third party. If a parent or guardian may bring a claim for damages arising out of a minor's Sickness or Injury, the terms of this subrogation and reimbursement clause shall apply to that claim. 13. in case of your wrongful death or survival claim, the provisions of this section apply to your estate, the personal representative of your estate, and your heirs. 14. your failure to cooperate with the Plan or its agents is considered a breach of contract. As such, the Plan has the right to terminate your Benefits, deny future Benefits, take legal action against you, and/or set off from any future Benefits the value of Benefits the Plan has paid relating to any Sickness or Injury caused by any third party to the extent not recovered by the Plan due to you or your representative not cooperating with the Plan.

This Plan will be the primary Provider of Coverage for totally disabled Employees who are actively employed and Dependents of actively employed Employees who are Covered Persons while entitled to disability benefits under Social Security. If any Covered Person is eligible for Medicare benefits because of End Stage Renal Disease, this Plan will be primary and Medicare will be the secondary Provider of coverage as determined by current Medicare guidelines. Medicare will be the primary Provider of coverage for any Retired Employee who is eligible for Medicare. Medicare will be the primary Provider of coverage for any Medicare-eligible Dependent of a Retired Employee. If a Retired Employee has a Dependent who is not eligible for Medicare, the Plan will be the primary Provider of Coverage for that Dependent. For Covered Persons where Medicare is the primary payor of benefits, the medical benefits of this Plan will be determined as though the Covered Person has both Part A (hospital) and the voluntary Part B (non-hospital) benefits of Medicare. If a Covered Person is not enrolled in Medicare Part A or B, the claim will be paid as if the Covered Person has both A and B coverage. If a Covered Person under this Plan also is covered or eligible to be covered under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act of 1965, as amended (Medicare Parts A, B, or C), as primary coverage, benefits are paid according to the Coordination of Benefits method defined in Section 10.2, Order of Benefits. The Plan will pay the difference between Medicare benefits payments and billed charges up to the Maximum Allowable Charge under the Plan. 9.7 C OORDINATION WITH STATE PLANS Payment for benefits with respect to a Covered Person under the Plan will be made in accordance with any assignment of rights made by or on behalf of such Covered Person or a beneficiary of the Covered Person, as required by a state plan for medical assistance approved under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid) pursuant to Section 1912(a)(1)(A) of such Act (as in effect on the date of the enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993). For purposes of enrollment, benefit determinations, and payments under the Plan, the fact that an individual is eligible for or is provided medical assistance under a state plan for medical assistance approved under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid) will not be taken into account. To the extent that payment has been made under a state plan for medical assistance approved under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid) in any case in which this Plan has a legal liability to make payment for items or services constituting such assistance, payment for benefits under the Plan will be made in accordance with any state law which provides that the state has acquired the rights with respect to a Covered Person to such payment for items or services.

Accounting of Certain Disclosures If the Plan Sponsor discloses PHI for any reason other than those described above or those made in response to an authorization signed by the Covered Person or the Covered Person's legally authorized representative, the Covered Person has a right, with limited exceptions, to receive an accounting of disclosures made by the Plan Sponsor.

This program only applies if the decision is based on either of the following: 1. Clinical reasons. 2. The exclusion for Experimental/Investigational or Unproven Services. 3. Rescission of coverage (coverage that was cancelled or discontinued retroactively). 4. As otherwise required by applicable law. The voluntary External Review Program is not available if the coverage determinations are based on Benefit exclusions or defined Benefit limits. This External Review Program offers an independent review process to review the denial of a requested service or procedure or the denial of payment for a service or procedure. The process is available at no charge to you after exhausting the appeals process identified above and you receive a decision that is unfavorable, or if UnitedHealthcare fails to respond to your appeal within the time lines stated below. You may request an independent review of the adverse benefit determination. Neither you nor UnitedHealthcare will have an opportunity to meet with the reviewer or otherwise participate in the reviewer's decision. All requests for an independent review must be made within four (4) months of the date you receive the adverse benefit determination. You, your treating Physician or an authorized designated representative may request an independent review by contacting the toll-free number on your ID card or by sending a written request to the address on your ID card. The independent review will be performed by an independent Physician, or by a Physician who is qualified to decide whether the requested service or procedure is a Covered Health Service under the Plan. The Independent Review Organization (IRO) has been contracted by UnitedHealthcare and has no material affiliation or interest with UnitedHealthcare or the City. UnitedHealthcare will choose the IRO based on a rotating list of appropriately accredited IROs.

In that case, Covered Expenses are the amounts billed by the provider, unless UnitedHealthcare negotiates lower rates. For certain Covered Services, you are required to pay a percentage of Covered Expenses in the form of a Copay and/or Coinsurance. Covered Expenses are subject to UnitredHealthcare's reimbursement policy guidelines.
