[](javascript:void(0)) About Bacterial Meningitis Meningococcal Disease (meningitis) is easily spread by direct contact, or by droplets of respiratory secretions (coughing, sneezing, kissing, and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation). Bacterial meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. The bacterium can also infect the blood. Symptoms include fever, headache, a stiff neck, and often nausea, vomiting, and mental awareness changes. Meningitis is often lethal because people associate early symptoms with the common flu, and don't consult a physician. However, symptoms can progress rapidly, sometimes leading to death in 24-48 hours. Following the initial symptoms, the disease can result in joint infection, pneumonia, organ system failure, and shock. Among those who survive Meningococcal Disease, approximately 20 percent live with severe health problems and permanent disabilities, including brain damage, kidney failure, learning disabilities, hearing loss, blindness, limb damage which may require amputation, and mental retardation. For more information, visit: HCC also follows state law in requiring all students enrolled in health-related higher education courses which will involve direct patient contact with potential exposure to blood or bodily fluids in educational, medical, or dental care facilities to receive additional vaccines. Students in qualifying health-related courses must have vaccines against tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccine (Tdap), measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, and varicella, subject to certain limited exceptions. Some programs require hepatitis C and influenza vaccinations and tuberculosis testing. Students with questions about their program of study and its requirements should contact the program director. Contact information for the program directors can be found on each academic program's page, located at [https://www.hccs.edu/programs/](https://www.hccs.edu/programs/).
