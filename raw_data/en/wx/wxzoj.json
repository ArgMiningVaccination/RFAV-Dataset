The CYP3A family is the most abundant subfamily of the CYP isoforms in the liver. There are at least four isoforms: 3A4, 3A5, 3A7 and 3A43 of which most important [1](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). CYP3A4 contributes to bile acid detoxification, the termination of action of steroid hormones, and elimination of phytochemicals in food and the majority of medicines [2](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm), [3](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Data sheets on the Medsafe website ( [www.medsafe.govt.nz](../../index.asp)) and the New Zealand formulary ( [www.nzf.org.nz](http://www.nzf.org.nz)) are useful sources of information on individual drug-drug interactions. Age-related Changes and Gender Differences Foetal levels of CYP3A4 expression, content and activity are very low, but appear to reach adult levels at around one year of age [1](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Clinical studies indicate that women metabolise drugs which are substrates of CYP3A4 more quickly than men (20-30% increase) [4](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Analyses have shown around two fold higher levels of CYP3A4 protein in female compared to male tissue samples [3](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm), [4](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Location CYP3A4 is mainly located in the liver and small intestine and is the most abundant cytochrome in these organs [1](#1). However, CYP3A4 levels in the intestines are not correlated with those of the liver [3](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Some medicines which are substrates of CYP3A4 have low oral (but not intravenous) bioavailability due to intestinal metabolism. The bioavailability of these substrates is dramatically changed by inhibition, induction or saturation of CYP3A4 [5](#5). Polymorphisms The is extremely high (>100-fold) [3](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm), [6](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Some variability can be attributed to allelic variation. A recently discovered single nucleotide polymorphism (CYP3A4*22) appears to be associated with decreased expression and activity (1.7 to 5 fold less). However, the frequency of this variant at around 2% of the population limits its contribution to overall CYP3A4 variability [1](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm), [2](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm), [3](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Another identified polymorphism is CYP3A4*1B which occurs at a frequency of 2-9% in some populations. However, a functional effect of this variant has not been established [3](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Hepatic and intestinal expression of CYP3A4 exhibits a unimodal distribution of activity suggesting that the population variability is not due to genetic polymorphism of the enzyme itself [2](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Nevertheless, there are indications of substantial heritability3. Variation in CYP3A4 among healthy individuals is most likely to be the result of differences in homeostatic regulatory mechanisms [2](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Effect of Disease In disease states, the inherent variability of CYP3A4 mediated drug metabolism is potentially exacerbated by many factors including alterations in hepatic haemodynamics, hepatocellular function, nutrition, circulating hormones, as well as drug-drug interactions [2,3](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). It has also been increasingly recognised that inflammatory mediators associated with a range of disease states are capable of having profound effects on CYP3A4 gene expression [2](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Patients with inflammation, particularly elevated acute phase proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP) have been noted to have reduced CYP3A4 function [2](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). This is clinically relevant in cancer patients because tumours can be a source of systemically circulating cytokines [3](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Acute systemic hypoxia (eg, in chronic or cardiac insufficiency) appears to up-regulate CYP3A4 activity [7](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Reports of CYP3A4 activity in critically ill children showed significantly lower CYP3A4 metabolism [1](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm), [8](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm) Inhibition CYP3A4 is subject to reversible and mechanism-based (irreversible) inhibition. The latter involves the inactivation of the enzyme via the formation of metabolic intermediates that bind irreversibly to the enzyme and then inactivate it [6](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). The clinical effects of a mechanistic inactivator are more prominent after multiple dosing and last longer than those of a reversible inhibitor [6](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Medicines that are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors include (but not limited - and resulting in immunosuppression caused by increased prednisolone levels [9](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). One form of reversible inhibition occurs due to competition between CYP3A4 substrates (eg, oestrogen and antidepressants during the of the menstrual cycle) [4](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Induction CYP3A4 activity is induced via the pregnane the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), peroxisome probably receptor (GR) [3](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm), [11](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). The magnitude of CYP3A4 induction can be substantial. Induction becomes apparent more slowly than inhibition and it takes more time for the induction to stop affecting medicine metabolism. For example, the induction of CYP3A4 by rifampicin takes around six days to develop and 11 days to disappear [11](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Induction normally results in a decrease in the effect of the medicine. However, it can lead to increased toxicity if the increased metabolism of the parent compound is accompanied by an increase in exposure to a toxic metabolite [11](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Medicines that are potent inducers include phenobarbital, phenytoin and rifampicin9. Many glucocorticoids in clinical use also induce CYP3A4. Some organochlorine pesticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and endrin also induce CYP3A4 [11](#11). Herb and Food Interactions Popular dietary supplements and foods that have a high risk for interaction with medicines metabolised by CYP3A4 include (but are not limited to) the following. Goldenseal Goldenseal (Hydrastis Canadensis) is often taken to try to prevent common colds and upper respiratory tract infections. It has been reported to reduce CYP3A mediated activity by 88%, equivalent to that seen with clarithromycin [12](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Black pepper Black pepper (Piper nigrum) has been used as a flavouring agent and medicine. When used for flavouring food it is not likely to affect the metabolism of most medicines [12](#12). However, excessive use or use in dietary supplements (piperine or piperamides greater than 10 mg) may produce clinically significant interactions, including CYP3A4 inhibition [12](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Schisandra Preparations of fruits from woody vines of Schisandra species are used in traditional Chinese, Japanese and Russian medicine, often as hepatoprotective agents [12](#12). Currently available clinical data strongly suggest that Schisandra extracts pose a significant risk for elevating blood levels of medicines that are CYP3A substrates [12](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). St John's Wort This is used for its antidepressant activity. The active substance is hyperforin, the most potent known activator of PXR [12](#12). Clinical studies have demonstrated that products containing less than 1% hyperforin are less likely to produce interactions [12](#12). However, most products contain 3% hyperforin [12](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Grapefruit Grapefruit (all sources) is a potent inhibitor of intestinal CYP3A4 that has been proposed to interact with more than 44 medicines and result in serious adverse effects [13](March2014UpdatePPIsAndClopidogrel.htm). Healthcare professionals should ask patients about their use of complementary and alternative medicines when considering the use of a medicine that is altered by CYP3A4.
