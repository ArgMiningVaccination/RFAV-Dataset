We take into consideration that this disease can be both symptomatic and asymptomatic. By formulating a suitable mathematical model via a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we investigate how the vaccination rate and the fraction of avoided contacts affect the population dynamics. |Primary Language||English| , M.
