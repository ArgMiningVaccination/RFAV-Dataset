Waking up energized and ready to take on the day just isn't reality for everyone. Many people need at least 30 minutes to snooze, splash their face with cold water, and brew up some motivation. Luckily, there are ways to help boost energy levels without ever needing to take a sip of caffeine. If it takes you some time to adjust to the day, we have just the things for you. Today, we've outlined three simple ways to help you have more natural energy every day. *Image by svetlanasokolova on Freepik 3 Ways to Boost Energy Naturally If you wish you had more natural energy - the kind that doesn't require caffeine - here are three tips to help increase your body's energy reserves. - Chill out Stress is a major energy killer. When our worries are high, our energy is low. Think about when you have a long day. All you want to do is sit down and relax, because that's what your body needs. Creating ways throughout the day to keep your stress levels low will help maintain your natural energy levels. Going on walks, taking a break from phone and computer screens, and breathing mindfully are great ways to bring some peace to your body and mind. - Exercise It may sound counterintuitive, but exercising is a great way to improve natural energy. When we move our bodies, we circulate oxygen and blood throughout our body. This helps deliver fuel to cells, and therefore provides a more efficient energy production system. Plus, exercise helps improve sleep patterns and mood, which both contribute to better natural energy levels. - Eat Well Food is one of our body's main sources of energy. It's important that we're giving our body healthy, energy-giving ingredients that will help it thrive and boost energy naturally. Enjoying grass-fed meat, seasonal produce, and enough water are the easiest ways to ensure we have the right fuel to feel energized each day. Even though Dandy Blend is 100% caffeine free, we have some customers that say it gives them a small burst of energy. If you love your morning coffee routine, but want to reduce caffeine, swap it out for Dandy Blend a few days per week. Happy Sipping!
