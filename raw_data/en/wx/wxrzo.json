Your immune system is your #1 defense against a ll bacterial and viral infections. Fortunately, we have ult imate control over the state of our immune systems and our families. Here are some of the best practices that we follow even in our own homes. *GET PLENTY OF SLEEP. Often minimized as a source of immune response but studies have shown that deep sleep improves the immune system directly. *HYDRATION. The #1 def icient nutrient in most Americans is WATER. Staying hydrated is critical for EVERY biochemica l process in your body including your immune system. *GET ADIUSTED. Regular chiropractic adjustments have been proven to boost your immune system. Th is is accomplished by improving the state of the nervous system which in turn improves the immune system. *EAT WELL. Be sure to eat a healthy diet. Avoid sugars if at all possible and do not overeat. This helps sustain a proper blood sugar level and prevents the moments of being \"famished\". We all know what happens when \"you're so hungry you can eat a cow\". *HEAL THY SOCIALIZATION. Although the government is encouraging \"de -socialization\". I encourage you to reconnect with your nuclear fam ily through conversat ion, family games and lots of hugs and cuddling. Family communication and physical touch have long been associated with decreased stress and improved overall health including the immune systems of the entire family.

I wanted to give you some simple, practical tips to fortify yourself in case you do get exposed. As with anything in our society, when extreme views are being expressed I find that the truth is somewhere in the middle. In my opinion, the level of fear and panic around this outbreak is disproportionate to the actual danger. By the same token, to deny that there is a danger is also irresponsible and problematic. Because of the way statistics are recorded, in the beginning of an outbreak the death rate will appear much higher than it actually is. The reason for this is that mild cases (people with few or no symptoms) are not recorded. With that said it is dear that elderly people (especially with pre-existing health conditions) are at a higher risk for coronavirus being a serious issue. Click here for a great article if you want to read more about these points . When it comes to a viral infection there are 2 things we have to consider. First is our exposure to the virus and second, how well your immune system responds. Taking reasonable precautions to limit your exposure (washing your hands ect.) makes total sense. Yet, I would argue that it may be even more important to focus on strengthening your immune system so you'll be protected in case you do get exposed. So what can you do to boost your immune system? Here is a list of my top 5 tips. I'll give you more details below. 1. Make sure you' re getting adequate Vitamin D. 2. Eat very little or NO sugar. 3. Reduce your stress. 4. Get adjusted regularly. 5. Support your gut health with diet and probiotics. 1. Vitamin D Having adequate Vitamin D levels is one of the most powerful ways you can support your immune system. Most of us are not getting enough sun this time of year so its important to supplement to make sure you get enough. A good baseline dosage is 1000 iu per day per 25 pounds of body weight. 2. NO Sugar Sugar is a double whammy. It pushes your body to be more acidic, creating an environment where viruses can thrive and it drives systemic inflammation which suppresses your immune response. Seriously limiting your sugar is a really good idea. 3. Reduce Your Stress Chronic stress suppresses immune function. The irony here is that being afraid of getting sick makes you more susceptible to getting sick. Exercise, yoga, meditation, getting plenty of sleep, and being with people you love are all powerful ways to reduce your stress. 4. Get Adjusted Regularly Your immune system is largely controlled by your brain and nervous system. Regular adjustments can de-stress and balance your brain, allowing it to coordinate your immune system more effectively. 5. Support Your Gut With Diet And Probiotics The majority of your immune cells live in your gut and they need fuel to function. The good bacteria in your gut produce something called butyrate which feeds your immune cells. Eating a diet with a good variety of veggies and supplementing with probiotics is just what those good bacteria need to thrive. Click here for a short video clip of Dr. Kiran Krishnan, the guy who developed the probiotics that I carry here at Vibrance, talking about their effect on the immune system. If you'd like to pick some up just let me know. If you need any support please reach out to me. Lets keep you healthy and strong so just in case you get exposed, coronavirus will not take you down!

Dear patients, friends, and family of Vanderloo Chiropractic, March2020 We know that your inboxes are full of COVID-19 updates, so we don't want to overwhelm you with communication, but we do want to share an update from us. Please read to the end. First off, E ARE OPEN! We truly believe that your chiropractic care is one of the most important defenses against this or any virus. Your nervous system is the master system that controls all of the other systems in your body, including your immune system. Getting adjusted helps keep your immune system strong! Vanderloo Chiropractic has always, and will continue, to maintain a clean and sanitary environment for our patients and staff. With so many news stories, it's understandable to be concerned about COVID-19. Please know that the precautions we already take every day to prevent the spread of infection, also helps prevent the spread of COVI D-19. We want our patients to feel secure knowing that your health and well-being are very important to us. Just like you, we have families we care about and want to keep healthy and safe. When something like the coronavirus hits the news, it can make us worry about everyday decisions. We feel compelled to respond with some encouraging and empowering words. One of the most important things we can do is continue with our normal lives, doing the things we enjoy and need to stay healthy, while taking reasonable precautions. Living our lives keeps us healthy and happy and teaches our kids good behaviors. The person best equipped to take care of you is you, but we've got your back (pun intended)! We clean our offices many times a day and every evening before we leave. Antiseptic wipes and other cleaners are used on every surface someone contacts. As we increase the frequency of cleaning, you may see us doing this even more often now. Even before the Coronavirus, we made it a point to wash our hands and use hand sanitizer all the time. In General: X ~ Wash, wash, wash your hands. Did you know that regular soap and water are more effective than hand sanitizer (and apparently easier to find ~ right now)? To really get clean, wash for at least 20 seconds - which just happens to be how long it takes to hum Row-Row-Row Your Boat three 5 times. ~ ~ Be sneeze- and cough-courteous. Coughing or sneezing into the inner crook of your arm, or into the collar of your shirt, catches the droplets ~ that would otherwise end up in the air or on the surfaces around you. Most viruses are transmitted through droplets, so this is important. (.) < Save the mask for Halloween. The benefit of a mask is that it controls the outbound expression of germs when someone coughs or sneezes. If you're healthy, a mask won't be very effective in preventing the spread of germs. If you're sick and need to be out in the world, a mask can help protect those around you when you cough or sneeze. If you do become sick, please seek appropriate medical attention. Don't touch your face! The easiest way to get sick (with any kind of virus) is to introduce germs from your hands to mucus membranes - like your eyes, nose and mouth. Kids may have a hard time with this one, please help gently remind them! Netflix and chill. If you're not feeling well (whether it's coronavirus or an old-school cold) please stay home, cuddle with your pet or a blanket and catch up on your favorite show. We'll see soon. Out in the World: Wipe it out. Many of us do this anyway but grab one of those wet wipes at the grocery store entrance to clean the cart handle. Deel utter! A clean desk or counter makes it easier to run a cleaning cloth across. Personal space. Keep at least 3 feet between you and someone who is sneezing or coughing. Own your bubble. Sharing = caring? Not right now! We're usually all about sharing, but for now the kindest thing you can do is avoid sharing food, drinks, utensils, etc. Public toys may not be as available in office during this time, so you are encouraged to bring your child's favorite toy to your visit. (What will we do without the trains?!?) Breathe in, breathe out. Ventilation is a good thing. Weather and location permitting, crack a window. Taking Care of Yourself: Be on your best behavior. Keep yourself in good shape by getting plenty of sleep, being physically active, drinking lots and lots of water, and eating nutritious foods. A stressed body is a weakened body, so manage your stress through exercise, yoga, prayer, meditation, or conversation with a trusted friend. Self-care matters! Caring for yourself is the best thing you can do for your overall health, including getting your CHIROPRACTIC ~DJUSTMENTS! If you're pregnant or breastfeeding, consider reading Dr. Aviva Romm's article. Keep breastfeeding!

Get adjusted! ~u n F y HOME GET STARTED TESTIMONIALS ABOUT SERVICES CONTACT BLOG CORONAVIRUS: The Facts, the Factors, and the Role of the Nervous System May 08, 2020 The coronavirus claims daily headlines across the nation and wo rld. The sensational reports tend to focus on tragedies and the ultimate reality that sicknesses can be deadly. Other positive realities and facts exist as well. The coronavirus is a common virus that causes an infection in the nose , sinuses, or upper throat. Most coronaviruses do not accompa ny the deadly outcomes catching media headlines. People infected with the coronavirus report coughs, fever, and respiratory issues. Some ex treme cases involve pneumonia. Antibiotics do not work against this viral attack on the immune system. Recove ry primarily involves the strength of the immune system. The bes t weapon fo r the coronavirus and the flu begins with building a stro ng, proactive immune system. One drop o f blood contai ns five million red blood cells, seven thousand white blood ce lls, and thousands of platelets. These cells work feverishly to heal and defend the body agai nst foreign invaders. The mos t amazing e lement of the process comes from the fact that the body adap ts and responds naturally and without a conscio us decision to do so. The entire process of adaptation and response operates under the direction of the central nervous system . Scientists discove red the unique connectio n between the central nervous sys tem and the immune sys tem and con tinue to compile resea rch and evide nce about the process. Chiropractic plays a key role because of the spine's relationship with immunity. Research shows that when the spine remains immobile of misaligned, the body ope rates in a heightened state of stress eq uivalent to being in battle. Ope rating in a heightened state of stress weakens rest, immunity, and growth wi thin the nervous system. Gen tle Chiropractic adjustments improve immunity by allowing the nervo us system to function at maximum capaci ty for healing and repair. Chiroprac tic adjustments increase moveme nt and improve al ignment while reducing stress. Evidence shows that people who receive regular adjustments report stronger immunity after beginning Chiropractic care . Research from 2010 determined that patients who received Chi ropractic adjustments showed increased levels o f a specific signaling molecule in the body called ln terleukin-2. lnterleukin-2 regulates the activities of whi te blood cells whic h are respons ible for immunity. The molecule impacts the body's natural response to microbial infection and helps the body recognize and create specific responses that neutralize foreign invaders. This protein molecule was found to be higher in those who received Chiropractic spinal adjustments when compared to those who did not. The primary focus of a Chiropractic adjustment does not center on treating a specific symptom or condition. The increased health and function from an ad justment represents an outcome which originates when interference is removed from the nervous system. W hile other professions focus on changing the environment to suit a weakened body, Chiropractic pursues strengthening the body to suit the environment. Four Keys to Improving Immunity: 1. Stay on track with adjustments to keep the autonomic nervous system i n balance. 2. Consume adequate amo unts of Vitamin D , a major immune booster. 3. Add 30-60 minutes of extra sleep to the daily routine. Inadequate sleep depletes immunity. 4. Drink water and remove sugary drinks and snacks from the diet. Sugar drains imm unity. 5. Move t he body. Exe rcise increases lymphat ic flow and provides sig nificant immune benefits.

After scouring resources and speaking with people ranging from researchers &epidemiologists to public health experts and health care professionals, we felt it important toaddress the issue. THERE ARE 3 CONSIDERATIONS AS WE SEE IT: 1. Epidemiologic Concerns - deals with the incidence, distribution and control of diseases(239) 200-7248(tel:2392007248)HOME (HTTPS:/ /WWW.UCARCOFLIFE.COM/) ABOUT PATIENTS SERVICES REVIEW SPINAL CARE COVID-19 2019-NCOV NOVEL CORONAVIRUS NCP 2. Immunological Concerns - branch of biology that covers the study of immune systems 3. Preparatory Measures - Involves proactive pursuit of solutions while collaborating health professionals Let me start by saying that all three are of equal importance and each consideration carries itsown concerns. As with most complex problems, we believe that COVID-19 requires amultifaceted approach in order to achieve true resolution. Most Epidemiologic Concerns restwith slowing the transmission of the Coronavirus also known as \"!attening the curve\", in part, toprevent an unsustainable load to our health care infrastructure. This is probably the singlegreatest threat to our community, as it would strain healthcare resources along with healthcarepersonnel, negatively impacting our ability to provide care for true life threatening conditions orcomplications that members of our community may face. The primary reason testing andquarantine measures are being discussed is to address these epidemiologic concerns. While COVID-19 has not proved to be a major problem in healthy populations, it is proving to be a challenge to those whose immune system is compromised. This very fact warrants attention andaction because no life is expendable. So as we receive updates and or instructions keep in mindthat every recommendation is not just for us, it is to bene \"t ALL of us. The Immunological Concerns rest with limiting exposure to those who are at greater risk for having complicationsand how to e #ectively support them, should they become ill. Currently the CDC still says that there is \"No speci\"c treatment for COVID-19 is currently available. Clinical management includesprompt implementation of recommended infection prevention and control measures andsupportive management of complications, including advanced organ support if indicated\".Furthermore, \"corticosteroids should be avoided, because of the potential for prolonging viralreplication as observed in MERS-CoV patients, unless indicated for other reasons.\" Yes, there hasbeen a lot of communication regarding rushing a vaccine to market. Our concern is that steps,designed to test safety for humans, are being skipped in the interest of time for a virus that theCDC still believes that \"Most will be able to recover from at home\". This means that the best course of action still rests with strengthening our immune systems if we are not ill and supporting it if we are, to give us the best opportunity to recover. Therefore thenext logical question is what Preparatory Measures should be taken to stack the odds in ourfavor. WHAT MEASURES CAN YOU TAKE TO PROTECT YOURSELF?1. Exercise Good Manners Most of the recommendations coming from every health related agency in the world fall underneath this category. All of which should be things that we exercise on a regular basisalready. Wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds If you cough or sneeze please do so into a tissue and then discard Avoid touching your face, in particular your eyes and nose Sanitize surfaces regularly 2. Consider Supplementing with Vitamin C & Vitamin D Both Vitamin C and D have been shown to have a favorable impact on the immune system alongwith having antiviral properties. It would be an excellent idea to have your Vitamin D levelstested by a healthcare professional and potentially supplement those levels. 3. Load your diet with Anti-Viral Foods & Eliminate Sugar Intake Sugar suppresses immune function so leave the twinkies alone please. Listed below are fewdi#erent foods that have been shown through research to have antiviral properties. Garlic Turmeric Echinacea Peppermint And many more... Google is your friend and at the bottom of this page are links to resourcesto get you started. 4. Get Adequate Sleep Getting continuous sleep, in particular REM sleep has also been shown to positively impactimmune modulators. So in times of high stress, it remains extremely important to carve out timeto ensure adequate sleep is acquired. 5. See Your Local Chiropractor As you can see, from the non-inclusive list above, there are several things that can be done proactively to ensure that your immune system is strong or to strengthen it in the event that it iscompromised. Chiropractic has been shown through research to positively impact key immunecompounds that are key to \"ghting o # and protecting against bacteria and viruses. Check out the links below highlighting their link to immune compounds, IgG and IgA. Our hope is that after we recover as a community there is a new found value on proactively keeping our defense(immune) system high. WHAT MEASURES ARE WE TAKING? Our stance and the decisions that we are making as a result of COVID-19 are not out of fear but inrespect of our responsibility as a health professional in the State of Florida and empathy for thecommunity that we serve. 1.

EVIDENCE SHOWS PEOPLE WHO CONSISTENT RECEIVE CHIROPRACTIC ADJUSTMENTS REPORT STRONGER IMMUNITY. HOW CHIROPRACTIC CARE STRENGTHENS YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM Scientists discovered the unique connection between the central nervous system and the immune system. They continue to compile research and evidence about the process. Chiropractic plays a key role because of the spine's relationship with immunity. Research shows that when the spine remains immobile due to misalignments , the body operates in a heightened state of stress equivalent to being in battle. Operating in a heightened state of stress weakens rest, immunity, and growth within the nervous system. Gentle chiropractic adjustments improve immunity by allowing the nervous system to function at maximum capacity for healing and repair.

The molecule impacts the body 's natural response to microbial infection and helps the body recognize and create specific responses that neutralize foreign invaders. This protein molecule was found to be higher in those who received chiropractic spinal adjustments when compared to those who did not.

Canned goods and hand sanitizer may be flying off the shelves faster than you can say zombie apocalypse, but the truth of the matter is that some of the best things you can do to avoid getting sick from Coronavirus are some of the same things recommended by the chiropractors at The Joint Chiropractic to help you stay healthy when faced with a variety of illnesses, including the common cold and flu. Yes, Coronavirus is concerning and more than a little scary. You may not even know where to begin to keep you and your family healthy, but focusing on the basics is a good place to start. Wash Your Hands You've likely heard this a million times but get ready to make it 1,000,001 -- you must wash your hands frequently. Simple handwashing with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds is your first line of defense from germs and is key to protecting yourself.

You should wash your hands before meals, after using the restroom, and after you've been in public where people are actively spreading germs, such as handling doorknobs and public touch screens. Also make sure not to touch your face when you're out and about because touching a germy object, such as a door handle, then touching your face is a great way to expose yourself to germs. Eat Right A healthy immune system starts in your gut. A balanced diet full of whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and healthy fats will keep the good teria in your gut happy. This microbiome is one of your body's first lines of ense when it's exposed to germs, so keep them healthy and you will keep rself healthy too. a good idea to cut down on added sugars because they can throw off the ance of good and bad bacteria in your gut. Make sure you stay well hydrated, ertainly doesn't hurt to increase your intake of Vitamin C, either as a food rce or supplement, or Vitamin D, which you can get from a few minutes in the sun, fortified foods, or as a supplement. Sleep Well It may be difficult to get a good night's rest when you're worried about pandemics, but if you're not getting a minimum of seven to eight hours of sleep each night, then you're doing your body (and immune system) a serious disservice. When you sleep, your body uses the time to rest and rejuvenate. Sleep is integral to your overall health and wellness, so make sure you're getting enough of it. If you find that you have trouble sleeping, then check your sleep environment. The room should be cool, dark, and quiet. Also take a look at your nighttime routine, making sure that all electronics are turned off at least one hour before bed and you're doing what you can to relax in that time to prepare your body for sleep. Scrolling through social media and reading about recent outbreaks probably isn't going to help you get the sleep you need, so turn it off and tune it out. See the Chiropractor Chiropractic care focuses on the function of the central nervous system, which just so happens to regulate every single function in your body. Regular chiropractic adjustments focus on the removal of spinal joint dysfunctions that can impact how your central nervous system communicates with the rest of your body. When your body is able to communicate freely and efficiently, then every system can work optimally to help you stay healthy. You cannot control the Coronavirus (or the flu or common cold either!) but what you can control are the things you do to support your own health. There's no new way to outsmart a virus, all you can do is go back to the basics to help you stay healthy. m ,s May, 2020 I Read More Recent News & Press Recent news, media appearances and press from around our network of 500+ chiropractic clinics.

Chiropractic treatments also address disorders that affect your nervous system . The immune system is closely tied to the nervous system, meaning that health in one area affects health in the other. The spread of the Coronavirus should have everyone thinking about their immune system. If you live in or around Fort Worth, TX, one of our chiropractors can administer non-invasive and drug-free treatments chiropractic care to boost your immune system. Our office is currently open, and we are taking great precautions to provide a safe and sanitary environment for our patients. How Does Chiropractic Care Boost Your Immune System? An impaired nervous system can lead to a weak immune system. The nervous, immune, and endocrine systems are linked and communicate through the use of special messenger molecules. A disruption in either of these systems can have negative effects on the others. Given the direct connection between the nervous and immune systems, spinal decompression and other treatments that we offer can play a critical role in boosting your immune system. Chiropractic adjustments help the entire body work better by improving nervous system function. Beyond addressing neural dysfunctions, chiropractic care reduces stress and boosts red blood cell counts. Both of these additional benefits can improve the health and effectiveness of your immune system. How Does Chiropractic Care Work? If you are a new patient, your first visit will include paperwork, consultation, examination, and possibly x-rays. You may be found to be a good candidate for spinal adjustments, physiotherapies, or soft tissue therapies. HOME WELCOME SERVICES NUTRITION & WELLNESS, Boosting Your Immune Function To Protect Yourself From Disease & Infections Though it should be taken seriously, COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus is only one of a slew of viruses spreading around this winter in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control has issued infection prevention habits to curb the spread of the virus around our communities. These recommendations include washing your hands with soap and warm water for 20 seconds or more and avoiding going out when you are feeling ill. These recommendations only scratch the surface of disease spread and prevention. Our body has a powerful ability to identify and manage foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria. The immune system is a complicated and elegant process that, when functioning correctly, can keep germs from multiplying and spreading and causing serious complications. We want to add to the CDC list of disease prevention habits with some additional recommendations for maintaining or improving our body's natural, healthy immune response. Taking measures to maintain a healthy immune system not only prevents severe complications from viruses like COVI D-19 but also ensures that we are healthy and robust to take care of others who might not be able to fight off infections. HOME OUR FOCUS STRAIGHTAHEAD NEW PATIENT CENTER RESOURCES f@a PEDIATRIC & FAMILY CHIROPR ACTIC SPEAKING REQUEST CALL NOW Dr. Timothy Stein DC \u00b7 March 12, 2020 The Sky is Not Falling Contrary to what has been popularized and pushed in the media, the sky is not falling. Like most of you, I have been monitoring the rapidly growing \"concerns\" and progression of the Coronavirus story (specifically COVID-19). That said, I honestly had no intention of chiming in on this topic or conversation, as this is not something I would typically would speak on. However, I have been asked by hundreds of people to please speak into this topic. So, in line with the vision of our office being centered around speaking truth into, and providing answers for families, and given the amount of unclear or incomplete information being published on this topic, I hope to provide some clarity and comfort to you in this brief post. That said, we do have a very real responsibility to ourselves, loved ones, community, and I believe God, to walk in wisdom rather than respond in fear. We've been given this gift of life and should cherish and steward it well. And, while we ourselves might currently be at low risk, we should \"serve\" those at higher risk by diligently trying to prevent the spread of this Coronavirus. To start, let me first say that COVI D-19 is a real thing, and it is a Medical matter. As such, this virus really is beyond our scope in the realm of \"treatment\". This is not just a disclaimer. Our focus has and always will be targeted on what creates, promotes, and fosters health OVER what causes disease. This is the drum we have always beat, and we are intentional about being defined by what we are for, rather than what we are against. As the pendulum swings, there seems to be extremes (always, right?) on both sides of this discussion, sadly birthed from incomplete or inaccurate information on both ends. The sky is not falling, but this is also not just \"fake news.\" So what is it? What's a more informed, complete, or comprehensive perspective look like? And, what can you do about it? All great questions ... I'm glad you asked (ha)! COVID-19 is a virus, specifically a strand of Coronavirus, that spreads through respiratory droplets and affects the Respiratory Tract primarily. Symptoms are most often mild and include: fever, cough, and shortness of breath. This is very similar to other viruses, and can often be confused with upper respiratory conditions like a common cold, flu, or even allergies, which makes is nearly impossible to gather accurate statistics on (more below). An alarming and completely counterproductive phenomenon that is happening with this \"pandemic\" is the amount of fear, stress, and downright panic it (or it's caricature as presented by the media) is invoking. It's well know that stress weakens our immune system. Some reports even go as far as to say 80-90% of all illness or disease, including cancer, is related to or caused by stress. Regarding Chronic Stress, one article says: \"Long-term stress suppresses or dysregulates innate and adaptive immune responses by altering the Type 1-Type 2 cytokine balance, inducing low-grade chronic inflammation, and suppressing numbers, trafficking, and function of immunoprotective cells. Chronic stress may also increase susceptibility to some types of cancer by suppressing Type 1 cytokines and protective T cells and increasing regulatory/suppressor T cell function.\" Stress crashes our defenses and lays us susceptible to illness ... a message we've \"preached\" for years now. This is the foundation of Chiropractic; that the body has within it an innate ability to fight off illness and disease, and if healthy and taken care of, it does a really good job at it! The Primary Premise of Chiropractic is that \"the body is a self healing & self regulating.\" This is not alternative medicine. This is Science! This quote above says this very thing, from a medical research perspective. No wonder it is spreading so fast. People are freaked out, and the media is driving that bus which they hope arrives at crazy-town. Sadly, many of them (media) are likely doing more harm than good, as the result is a large population of people with lowered resistance, and a higher susceptibility to infection because of the fear they are being pushed toward. That's as high as my \"soap-box\" gets here. So, with all the hype, what is not gaining much popularity regarding this \"pandemic\" is who is getting it? It is not shocking that unhealthy people tend to get sick (and sicker) more often. Such is that truth with COVID-19. As reports of the affected, or infected, people surface, and specifically those who have sadly passed away as a result, many of them already suffered from chronic disease processes like diabetes, COPD (smokers), and Cardiovascular disease, etc. In fact over 60% of the deaths in the US were in Washington, and have been linked to a single nursing home. One news article on this says: \"Since February 19, 26 residents have died, 13 of whom were confirmed to have COVI D-19, the illness caused by the virus. In total, 19 deaths in the state have been tied to the center.\" Wait, did you catch that though? 26 residents of that facility died in the past 3 weeks, which is sad for sure ... but only 50% of those deaths were linked to Coronavirus. Also, 51 residents of this faculty have been confirmed to have contracted the virus, with only 3 being transferred to the hospital, the others being monitored in the home. I do not want to be presumptuous or seem inconsiderate with this delicate matter, but if it wasn't Coronavirus, the common flu or any other infection might have had the same effect, right? Okay, so what do you need to know? Actually this link here, from the CDC, does a great job of updating and informing you on precautions and steps to take in prevention. Please read it because my intention with this post is not to tell you to wash your hands and sneeze into a crooked elbow. However, being that the CDC and WHO have always been focus on disease prevention (or control), I believe they are lacking or missing, a KEY element. Health! The best defense is a strong offense! The best prevention you can gain is found in being healthy. Our choices have consequences, and if those choices over the years have lead to a less that ideal current health status, then the consequence is a greater susceptibility to COVID-19, or any illness in general. Sorry, did that sound \"naggy?\" I hope not! It is the conversation that should be had, but will not boost ratings or create a buzz. People, stuck in a stress response, do not think logically or act rationally (video coming on this soon). This is why Costco is sold out of TP and Water. When the panic button is smashed for any of us, we become emotionally driven and do things we otherwise would not. ( side note, this is exactly what we see in ADHD and Neurodevelopmental Kids we see and help!). I kind-of understand the risk of being quarantined, but I doubt our water source will get polluted (more than it already is, ha) or that our ability to light a fire and boil water if need be will be gone. And it's just 14 days, how much crap are we talking about here in two weeks time? So, build your health. Don't lock yourself inside unless you are an infections threat. MOVE! The best defense to a stress response is movement (insert chiropractic adjustment too). So forget that New Years resolution that's long gone; Exercise as if your life depends on it (too harsh? probably!). Also, eat right! Instead of driving to Costco for last minute \"prepper supplies\" (which, come on people, you should already have all that stuff ... it's not if, but when ... ha, again probably too much info.) maybe run or walk to the local grocery store, or even better yet, a produce stand if you have one in your area, and load up on fruits and veggies. And, the final thing I will leave you with, for now at least, is that Chiropractic time and again has proven to boost immune function. You knew that was coming, and that I would say it! But seriously, the science and straight up results we see at Straightahead are undeniable. Remember all that nerdy talk in the beginning of this post about stress suppressing immunity? Well, guess what Chiropractic does? It helps our bodies better regulate and control our stress and therefore immune response. This is by no means saying Chiropractic treats Coronavirus. What I am saying is that Chiropractic naturally boost our immune system, raises our defenses, & optimizes our health and healing potential ... all things that promote our well-being and give us more \"fight\" against illness. So, perhaps the greatest thing you can do for your family during this time of infectious (and/or infection) uncertainty is Straightahead ... Get check. Let's chat and take a look at how well (or unwell) your body is functioning and responding to stress. We don't guess we test, and we have the technology to do it! Okay, one more final thing ... While kids are among the lowest population at risk, we, as always, are working diligently to make sure our office is as clean and safe as possible for your family. 9 1528 Walnut St . #1812 Philadelphia, PA 19102 Stone Brid Measures to Minimize COVID-19 infection Measures to Minimize COVID-19 infection and maximize your immunity to protect yourself, family, and loved ones: 1.

In addition to following the recommendations given by the CDC concerning prevention, you may be rummaging through your medicine cabinet or in the health aisle of your grocery store looking for something to do the trick. However, while many products on the market promise a variety of health benefits, it is usually hit or miss when it comes to their effectiveness and even if they are truly healthy for your body. When it comes to your health, you can never be too careful. For this reason, we would like to offer an alternative, natural option to fueling your immune system: chiropractic care! It is believed that chiropractic care can boost the immune system and statistics show that patients (kids in particular) are sick less often. YOUR SPINE AND THE IMMUNE SYSTEM The immune system is the body's first line of defense against infection, and how you treat your body can drastically impact its effectiveness. Factors such as nutrition, exercise, posture, rest. and spinal health are important to have a strong immune system. When the spine is misaligned dysfunctions in the nervous system can occur. This can cause stress on various parts of your body and lead to a weak immune response. This response can help explain why many patients who suffer from inflammatory conditions tend to have weaker immune systems such as those with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders. As we have already established, the immune system is heavily reliant upon the nervous system for its strength. So how can you strengthen the immune system? Simply by ensuring the health of your nervous system! A chiropractic adjustment helps to correct misalignments, decrease inflammation, and relieve pressure within the spine. All of these can benefit your spinal health and improve the well being of your nervous system, triggering a strong immune response. With a healthy body and a boost in your immune system , you can tackle the day ahead knowing that your body is prepared to fight off any threat to your health- all thanks to your initiative to care for your spine! ADDITIONAL WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR IMMUNE RESPONSE As we mentioned above, there are multiple factors to improving your immune response and notjust keeping your spine in alignment. Practicing good habits for nutrition and getting plenty of exercise and rest are also very important to optimizing your immune response and maintaining a healthy defense system for your body. When examining your diet. try to limit your sugar intake as it is not good for your immune system. and is simply not a healthy choice for your body. Alternatively, consider foods that have large amounts of Vitamin C in them such as fresh fruits and vegetables. Vitamin C is essential in achieving and maintaining that immune system boost. and is good for you! Additionally, it is important to supply your body with plenty of Vitamin D. Spending some time outdoors taking a brisk walk or simply enjoying your morning coffee on the porch will not only give you some fresh air but will also help supply your body with those vitamins that are best supplied by the sun. Of course, you will want to remember your sunscreen! During this season of frequent illness, do your body a favor and schedule an appointment for a chiropractic adjustment. By nurturing your spinal health you will also be nurturing a strong, healthy immune response! For more information or to schedule an appointment. contact Stellhorn Chiropractic today.

Receive regular frequent chiropractic adjustments (according to Dr. Donald Pero's, PH. D., Chief of Research at New York's Preventative Medical Institute and Professor of Medicine at New York University). Dr. Pero's research study of 107 individuals who received long term chiropractic care chiropractic patients had a remarkable 200% greater immune competence than those who didn't receive chiropractic care. Despite a wide range of ages in this study, immune competence did not show any decline with age and remained uniform for the entire group. It is for this reason that new patients are encouraged to keep their chiropractic appointments to increase their immune system defenses and protect against all infectious diseases. Existing patients are encouraged to keep their adjustment appointments and to consider an increase in their frequency in their adjustments to maximize their immune and nervous system function. 2.

The sensational reports tend to focus on tragedies and the ultimate reality that sicknesses can be deadly . Other positive realities and facts exist as well. The coronavirus is a common virus that causes an infection in the nose, sinuses, or upper throat. Most coronaviruses do not accompany the deadly outcomes catching media headlines. People infected with the coronavirus report coughs, fever, and respiratory issues. Some extreme cases involve pneumonia. Antibiotics do not work against this viral attack on the immune system. Recovery primarily involves the strength of the immune system. The best weapon for the coronavirus and the flu begins with building a strong, proactive immune system. One drop of blood contains five million red blood cells, seven thousand white blood cells, and thousands of platelets. These cells work feverishly to heal and defend the body against foreign invaders. The most amazing element of the process comes from the fact that the body adapts and responds naturally and without a conscious decision to do so . The entire process of adaptation and response operates under the direction of the central nervous system. Scientists discovered the unique connection between the central nervous system and the immune system and continue to compile research and evidence about the process. Chiropractic plays a key role because of the spine's relationship with immunity. Research shows that when the spine remains immobile of misaligned, the body operates in a heightened state of stress equivalent to being in battle. Operating in a heightened state of stress weakens rest, immunity, and growth within the nervous system . Gentle Chiropractic adjustments improve immunity by allowing the nervous system to function at maximum capacity for healing and repair . Chiropractic adjustments increase movement and improve alignment while reducing stress. Evidence shows that people who receive regular adjustments report stronger immunity after beginning Chiropractic care. Research from 2010 determined that patients who received Chiropractic adjustments showed increased levels of a specific signaling molecule in the body called lnterleukin -2. lnterleukin -2 regulates the activities of white blood cells which are responsible for immunity. The molecule impacts the body 's natural response to microbial infection and helps the body recognize and create specific responses that neutralize foreign invaders. This protein molecule was found to be higher in those who received Chiropractic spinal adjustments when compared to those who did not. The primary focus of a Chiropractic adjustment does not center on treating a specific symptom or condition. The increased health and function from an adjustment represents an outcome which originates when interference is removed from the nervous system. While other professions focus on changing the environment to suit a weakened body, Chiropractic pursues strengthening the body to suit the environment. Four Keys to Improving Immunity: 1) Stay on track with adjustments to keep the autonomic nervous system in balance. 2) Consume adequate amounts of Vitamin D, a major immune booster. 3) Add 30 -60 minutes of extra sleep to the daily routine. Inadequate sleep depletes immunity. 4) Drink water and remove sugary drinks and snacks from the diet . Sugar drains immunity . 5) Move the body. Exercise increases lymphatic flow and provides significant immune benefits.

Over the past several weeks, the Coronavirus (COVID-19) has rapidly spread to pandemic levels, demanding the attention of not just our community, but the entire world. The virus spreads among people in close contact primarily through respiratory droplets that travel from person to person with coughing or sneezing. In the United States, entities such as businesses, schools, and even major sports leagues across the have halted operations to decrease the spread of this virus. As health care providers in the Springfield area, we wish to share with you some tips on how to optimize your health to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Here are 5 ways you can optimize your health and help protect your families and loved ones. #1 STAY HOME IF YOU ARE SICK Common symptoms of COVI D-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath, and can range from mild to severe. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, or other illness-related symptoms, the best thing you can do to prevent spreading any illness is to remain at home. #2 WASH YOUR HANDS FREQUENTLY With the virus spreading through respiratory droplets after coughing and/or sneezing, it is vital to wash your hands frequently. This will help prevent spreading from person to person by means of both direct contact (i.e. handshakes) and indirect contact (i.e. doorknobs). While this should be a staple of everyday hygiene, it is especially important during time periods like flu season and viral outbreaks like COVID-19. #3 GET ADJUSTED One of the best things you can do for your immune system, your body's main defense system, is get adjusted by your chiropractor. Your nervous system is the master system of the body, and a well-functioning nervous system will lead to a well-functioning immune system. Proactively boosting your immune system through chiropractic can help keep you healthy and strong during this time. Connect with Us!

SCHEDULE NOW Auto Injury Symptoms I Headaches & Dizziness Whiplash & Neck pain Shoulder & Upper Back Pain Lower Back Pain Mar13 Statement on COVID-19 Due to the notice of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Florida, we wanted to update you on procedures we are implementing to keep you and your family safe during this time. We are closely following the centers for disease control's guidelines/recommendations on the steps we can take to help prevent and spread the virus. We're also keeping close tabs on the lead of local government. We want you to be confident in knowing that we are taking any and all measures to stay on the forefront of this. We can comfortably tell you that there is no need to panic or worry. If we all do our part and follow the simple guidelines from below everything will be OK. Cleaning Measures: Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, our team members would disinfect the adjusting tables before and after shifts, and periodically throughout the day as needed. We have disinfectant wipes available to our Practice Members in each adjusting room. You are more than welcome to use these at any time, before and/ or after your adjustment. Due to the recent pandemic, we are now increasing our frequency of cleaning these adjusting tables to every_30 minutes, and taking extra precautions to clean all surfaces of our office throughout the day, including: door handles, keyboards, countertops, computer screens, etc. We asked you assist in our efforts by sticking to the following protocol: If you're feeling any less than 100%, please stay home and away from the public. If you're experiencing fever, cough, or shortness of breath- seek medical attention. Upon entering our office, please sanitize your hands. When leaving please do so again. If you cough at our office (for whatever reason) please wash your hands. Place face paper down on the adjusting table prior to laying down for your adjustment. This regular use of face 12a12er serves as an additional safety measure to protect the practice members that we serve. Education & Research: We understand that there is a swirl of anxiety and fear regarding the present situation. It is our goal to put you at ease amidst this global event. We have a host of resources on our website, and in our office, to help you better understand the vital role that chiropractic care has on your health and your immune system. What Can YOU Do Now to Protect Yourself: 1. GET ADJUSTED!It is now more important than ever to stay on track with your weekly chiropractic adjustments. PREVENTION of sickness and dis-ease is key! In fact, we have several practice members receiving extra adjustments this month, to boost their immune system. We are eager to keep you well-adjusted through this time. With specific, neurologically-based chiropractic care, should you contract any illness, your healing and recovery times will experience a boost. Ranicki Chiropractic Wellness Fax: 912-748-1507 There is a tremendous amount of fear at the moment surrounding the Coronavirus. I am not going to say that there is nothing to worry about; however, there has been much more fear generated than is merited. And all of the attention is put on how bad it might get instead of on what you can do to build your immune resistance. Thetragedy is that is where all of our empowerment would be. It is important to remember that exposure to any virus or bacteria isthe smaller part of the equation. It is much more important focus your efforts and energies on building and boosting thefunction of your immune system. Remember that the reason medical doctors and nurses are not all constantly sick eventhough they have non-stop daily exposure to sick patients coughing and sneezing all around their ofces is that when your hostresistance, your immune function, is high the germ doesn't get a chance to establish itself and cause sickness. The reason thatwe are still here after all of these years and the dominant species on Earth is that our immune systems are fully capable. If youdon't feel that yours, or a loved one's, is then change that and if you've been told by the experts that there is nothing that youcan do be one of those people that proves the experts wrong. People are told every day that it's hopeless for them and thenthey do the thing that the doctor laughed at, told them not to waste their time with, and get better. Maybe you can be one ofthose people too. I want to share with you what I am doing to protect myself and my wife, Jen, during this time. Here's the disclaimer: these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA, the CDC, the FBI or the KGB. This is what I amdoing for myself and since COVID-19 is a medical condition and I am not a medical doctor it would not be within my scope ofpractice to tell you how to treat or prevent COVID for yourself or your families. Hopefully that satises anyone that is particularabout that sort of thing. To begin with; why should you listen to me? I have not had a single day of worked missed in almost 25 years now. That is notto say that I have not had any sort of cold in 25 years. What it means is that when I have, I got over it in less than 24 hours inmost cases and it was a minor nuisance that rarely was anyone else able to detect. But perhaps I am just genetically strongeryou say? When I was a child I was constantly sick. I was always green either in my nose, or sinuses or lungs. Every cut or scrape I ever got became infected. I lived on antibiotics and cold medicines. I was more friends with the nurses at my doctor's ofces than with the kids down the block. My mother never let us eat any kind of junk except on one of our birthdays, butotherwise there was no soda, chips or Little Debbie's in the house. I was fed duck, lamb, veal, asparagus, spinach andeverything else that is really healthy, but not the kind of foods kids usually like to eat so that should have kept me prettyhealthy, but nonetheless I was not. Until I was 10 years old and started receiving Chiropractic care that my health changed forthe better. I am, apparently, not genetically superior to everyone else, yet I have found a system that has worked to keep memuch healthier than the average person, I would argue, and it could work for you too. Also, I have not needed any medication in over 20 years now. No ibuprofen, no antibiotics, no Neosporin, nothing. That shouldspeak volumes too. If you want the Cliff's Notes version or are allergic to reading any more than 1 page here it is. If you want more detail about thespecics of what I do for each of these strategies keep reading.

Autism, Brain Injury AndNeurological Therapies Wellness - Revolutionize YourHealth Patient Reviews Blog Meet The Team $49 New Patient Special New Patient Contact Veri%edTestimonialsThe key pillars of what I do to keep my immune system high: eat extremely well (I am very diligent about knowing what I am puttinginto my body and what has been added to my food), stay wellhydrated, stay active, get great quality and quantity of rest, getplenty of sun to keep my Vitamin D levels high, releasing stress,cultivating my microbiome (the good microorganisms that live insideof our bodies that make up 70% of our immune system). Thecornerstone of all of those things is keeping my nervous system inpeak performance mode with Chiropractic care. There are specic things that I do differently with each of thesethings when I am either having, or trying to avoid, an immuneresponse, like right now. More Specics: Diet This is a time when I nd it to be even more important that usual to purify my diet. Thatmeans no articial flavors, colors or preservatives. No foods known to be highlycontaminated with insecticides (mostly neurotoxins) or weed killers (seen the news storiesabout the link between Roundup and cancer and how much Roundup has made it into ourfood supply?). That would include genetically modied organisms (GMO) such as corn,canola and soy as well as crops that are intentionally killed to make the harvest easier likewheat and many other grains. I think a grain-free diet is always a good idea, but especiallynow not only because of the Roundup issue, but also because the impact most grains haveon blood sugar is pretty high and that suppresses the immune system. Also, and this is theleast fun one, no alcohol at all during that time. I am a dark beer kind of guy and even brewmy own beer, but during this time and until it has blown over, I will be abstaining. If I amsupposed to be going out with friends for a drink after work and I have the tiniest little bit of asore throat, then I either don't go or I nominate myself to be the designated driver. It's notworth it to me to let it turn into something bigger. I also jack up the servings of vegetables and fruits and dial down the amount of meat for a while. Most benecial bacteria thrive in an alkaline environment and mostpathogens thrive in an acidic environment and so I am trying to alkalize my body a little more, or at a minimum, not acidify it.Sodas, coffee, teas, grains and meat all push us towards acidity in our body and greens and other veggies push us towardsalkalinity. I don't feel that I need to rush out and get the pH 8.4 bottled water, just drink water that is not in plastic bottles andavoid the acidiers. My usual serving count of fruits and veggies is 10/day but during an immune issue I will take it up to 12 aday. Juicing is key to being able to do that. My Vitamix gets a lot of use. More Specics: Hydration Whereas I might normally indulge in a caffeinated coffee either Saturday or Sunday (but notusually both) I will either avoid the coffee altogether or choose swiss water method decaffeinatedcoffee. If I am already feeling the beginnings of a cold then I avoid it altogether, no matter howgood it smells. The usual quantity of water for me is 100 oz of water but I'll go even higher whendealing with a cold or trying to prevent one. And like I already said I avoid anything dehydrating.Other culprits that are dehydrating are high fructose corn syrup, articial flavors, sweeteners,colors and additives, carbonation (yep, even your \"essenced\" sparkling water is dehydrating), andof course, alcohol. More Specics: Activity Notice I did not say exercise. We should not need exercise if we are active enough throughout the day. When exercisebecomes a need is when we have to concentrate a whole lot of movement into a pretty short period of time to offset sitting formost of the day. I do sit some, but I have no place to sit at my computer at all and while I am caring for patients it is a ton ofmovement. The common thought was that, since our immune system requires a lot of energy, it was wise to rest during animmune response. More recent research has found that while we are actively exerting ourselves we are producing higherquantities of immune globulins and interferons, immune boosting chemicals. During an immune situation exertion andincreased activity becomes a higher value for me. But I am not really a gym and weights kind of guy; it bores me to tears.Instead that is the day that I will decide to take on a hard project out in the yard and moving fast while doing it, enough toget a good sweat going. If you like thegym then you could do that. More Specics: Rest Work hard and then rest hard. I generally fall asleep easily and wake after 6 hours of sleep ready to go. But, from time to timethere is something that is worrying me or stressing me and I don't fall asleep as easily. Then I will use a technology calledbinaural beat technology. Binaural beats cause our brain waves to speed up or slow down, depending on the frequency of thebinaural beat used. Slowing our brain waves down the right amount and right way can make it easier to get to sleep whensleep is not coming easily. The effect is only while listening to the binaural beats; there is no lasting change. There are a ton ofapps you can put on your phone for binaural beats, but I steer clear of those and stick with the pioneers of the technology. Icould pick up a guitar and make some noise, but not anything that would be functional as listenable music. I could put brush tocanvas, but I couldn't paint anything that would function as art. Any monkey can use simple software to create binaural beats,but there is a real art to creating something that will work and get the change you are looking to see. The brand of that Irecommend is Hemi-Sync (www.Hemi-Sync.com). They have a lot of option to help with sleep, but 'Sleeping through the Rain'and 'Seaside Slumber' are my go-to's. I feel that theidea of choosing a temperature to keep the room atbecause some study found that most people sleepbetter at some cold temperature makes no sense.Are you 'most people'? I am certainly not. I sleepbest when I am toasty and warm. And fortunately, fornow, so does Jen. I will probably be able to selltickets to the knockdown drag-out ghts over thethermostat that will be coming someday. More Specics: Stress Release There is no getting rid of stress, but we can change ourbody's response to stress. That's where I focus. For me,accomplishment is one of my best stress relievers.Knocking things off of the todo list and having a sense ofaccomplishment makes the stress melt away better thananything else, with the exception of vacationing. Perhapsthat is because, for me, one of the bigger sources of stressis seeing the list of things that have to get done grow fasterthan I can get them done. The other key to successfullyhandling that is getting more critical with what I let on mylist. Anyone and everyone will put more and more on ourplates, if we let them. Getting realistic with what can beaccomplished in a day and a week and being willing to say\"No\" is super important to keeping the stress from gettingout of control. I set control measures in place when I rstestablished my practice to be sure that I would have thetime to get done the other things that have be done inaddition to caring for patients and then still have times onthe weekend to just be with myself and be with Jen. I could push harder and build an even bigger practice and be even more successful, but watching my mentor go through his4th divorce taught me that nding work-life balance had tobe a high priority for me, and for the quality of care that Iwant to provide. No one gets better when the doctor isburnt out. But, in spite of watching like a hawk who I amletting put what on my plate, things will happen and theproverbial poop will hit the fan. The cortisol that our bodiesproduce to help us deal with the kinds of stress that are lifeor death situations is still produced with today's much lessintense, but persistent, types of stress. Cortisol has manyfunctions in our body and one of them is to suppress theimmune system. Who cares about germs if you have asaber tooth tiger trying to eat you? Hemi-Sync is a powerfultool that I use for helping with high stress situations too.\"Surf\" is my go-to for stress release. And if all of that is notenough for the stress of a crisis there is always my boat.For others there is shopping, or golf or crocheting, but forme getting out on the water is the best stress release of all,as long as the motor starts. More Specics: Vitamin D Vitamin D is a important part of the immune system and most Americans seem to be very decient in it these days. The longsleeves and pants that are part of many of our work attire, the indoor jobs and the pervasive use of sunscreen that we have been convinced is the smart thing to do has us decient in somethingthat human kind has always had all it could need. Vitamin D is found very little in any foods and our gut does not absorb it verywell. What I do for myself is to go outside early in the year, late February to early March here in the Savannah area and get myshirt off and be outside in shorts. I get as much skin exposed as possible when the sun is not intense enough to burn and startworking on building a base tan so that I can be out on the water all day later on in the year and not burn. I will only usesunscreen if I am traveling somewhere that the sun is much stranger than home earlier in the year than I have been able to geta base tan going and know burning would be unavoidable. Even then, I make my own sunscreen from Zinc oxide, titaniumdioxide, coconut oil, mango and shea butters, beeswax and honey. I know everyone has been convinced that sunscreen is thesolution to all of life's woes, but the research does not support that, or the safety of the chemicals in commercially availablesunblocks. Research suggests that sun exposure does increase one's risk of skin cancer but decreases the risk of mortalityfrom all types of cancer as a whole. The FDA has recently recognize that the chemicals in sunblocks do cross the skin barrierand get into the blood stream (I suspect that the spray-on sunblocks are even worse since the person spraying and everyonearound them is breathing in those chemicals and most likely getting them into the blood that way) and that many of thosechemicals are unsafe. I believe that our bodies are incredibly intelligent and just can't buy into the idea that the sun that hasalways been there in the sky above us for all of our existence on Earth is the most dangerous thing in the universe. I expectsome day research will show that it is the avoidance of the sun and then suddenly getting a high exposure that is the problem.If I am feeling the start of any immune issue I will get outside and sunbathe a good bit. But there are times that the weather isnot conducive to getting Vitamin D from sun exposure and I still need that immune boost that Vitamin D can give. I have seenmany patients taking really high doses of Vitamin D their medical doctor has prescribed for them only to say that their VitaminD levels are the same, or even lower than before. Unsurprisingly, the doctor usually increases the dose even higher instead ofrealizing that they are just not going to get the Vitamin D levels up that way. Instead I use sublingual drops and hold themunder my tongue for 60 seconds before swallowing it, although I could just spit it out instead. Sun is best, but this is the nextbest option. I would get 5000 iu's on a usual day, but if I was already dealing with some immune issue I would double it to10,000 iu's. More Specics: Cultured Microbiome 70% of our immune systems is not \"us\" cells, but instead our microbiome. That means all of the good, desirablemicroorganisms (bacteria, yeast, viruses and that live inside of us and perform lots of valuable functions for us, includingmaking vitamins for us and ghting undesirable germs for us. But, the microbiome doesn't just take care of itself and we are,without intending to, doing more now than ever to harm our microbiome. Many food additives, insecticides and herbicides havegermicidal properties to them and when consumed will harm our microbiome. Taking cycles of antibiotics, antiviral andantifungals, whether truly needed or not, will upset the microbiome as well. But even if we lived in a utopia with no chemicalexposure at all, our own stomach acids and enzymes will create a certain amount of attrition in our microbiome. Until relativelyrecently in human culture this was naturally countered by eating most of our food raw and inoculating everything from mouthup to the sinuses and down to the anus with microganisms with every bite of food we took. When we picked the pepper rightoff of the plant and put it directly into our mouth without cooking it or washing it rst it was covered in life and was the originalprobiotic. Now, even with eating most of vegetables raw and buying mostly organic I still don't think I am getting the sameprobiotic exposure that humans once did and taking a probiotic supplement is an important strategy in my immune strategy.But when I am dealing with the beginnings of an immune issue, or concerned about preventing one, I use them differently thanmost. The rst site of incubation for most germs is the back the nose and the back of the throat and that's where I want toinoculate myself with probiotics in this situation. Stress plays a major role in many illnesses and can cause alterations in the immune response. Immune cells responsible for attacking microbes are sensitive to certain brain chemicals & become inactive when they come into contact with these chemicals. Stress hormones slow the immune response, which is why the immune system suffers in people under chronic stress. Chiropractic helps to break this cycle Chiropractic & Immunity I open the capsule and sprinkle the powder out into my hand (or on saucer because when else do you get to use those things these days) and then I dip my pinky nger into some water, into the powder so some of it sticks to my nger and then put that barely up into my nostril (there is no need to go all the way up into the brain). Then use a different nger (that's important) intothe water, the powder and then the other nostril. Then, since you didn't use the same nger, you can lick the rest of theprobiotic powder off of your palm and make a thin paste out of it with a tiny sip of water, or just a good bit of saliva, and swish itall around your mouth, gargle with it, and keep repeating as long as you can before swallowing it. The more contact time thebetter the inoculation. Don't worry, it tastes like powdered milk; nothing gross. Oh, and while swishing and gargling this is agood time to wash one's hands. Four criteria you want to make sure your probiotic has: 1. It has been kept refrigerated.Otherwise it is not viable. 2. It contains many different strains, not just buttloads of one. 3. In particular it should haveLactobacillus Plantarum. That has the word 'plant' built into it and this strain is the one that grows the most on the surface offruits and vegetables and would be the dominant strain in the guts of hunter-gatherers. 4. It was produced without any dairy,corn wheat or soy. They have antimicrobial effects. My favorite brand of Probiotic is Innate Choice's Probiotic Sufciency. Thenyou have to feed your microbiome. If you put good bacteria in and then starve them, while feeding undesirable yeasts, thatwon't help. The main food source of good inhabitants of your microbiome is going to be soluble ber, the ber that is found infruits and vegetables, not grains. Jacking up your servings of fruits and vegetables like we discussed earlier will help here too.Juicing can be a big help to them too, as long as you don't use a juicer that discards the pulp. The Vitamix, Ninja andNutribullet style juicers leave all of the ber in. It is also important to not consume foods that would have an antibacterialimpact. Dairy that is not organic will contain antibiotics which will impact your microbiome. Foods contaminated withGlyphosate (the weed killer RoundUp) will also damage your microbiome. This includes all genetically modied corn, soy andcanola and all of their oils, proteins, starches and other derivatives. More Specics: Chiropractic Care What does someone's back have to do with the immunesystem? Not much, really, but the nervous system haseverything to do with the immune system. They areinseparable; we have nerve endings that sense a widearray of different immune chemicals, white blood cellshave receptors that respond to neurotransmitters.Chiropractic is all about caring for the nervous systemand, in turn, optimizing and supporting the immunesystem. Remember how I started this article off sayinghow sick I was as a child up until 10 years old? The thingthat changed for me was that I started gettingChiropractic care for scoliosis. In the process ofcorrecting misring nerves, called subluxations, my brainwas better able to get my immune system to recognizethat dust, pollen and dog hair were trying to kill me andfree up resources to handle the germs that actually were.In a few short months I went from the sickest kid in class,constantly leaving school early for yet another doctor'sappointment to the healthiest kid in class that nevermissed another day of school for years. I went fromtaking 12 medications every breakfast and dinner constantly to, now, I haven't had a single medication, no aspirin, Tylenol, ibuprofen or antibiotic in 20 years now. Research studies have found that there is an immediate and signicant increase in white blood cell counts following an adjustment, that people getting Chiropractic care can respond better to immune stresses from carcinogenic loads and repairtheir DNA. The children of Chiropractors have dramatically different rates of ear infections, need for antibiotics and many other'typical childhood issues'. This is a very powerful tool I use to help keep my immune system optimized. I get adjusted weeklyduring the usual course of events, but I increase my frequency of care whenever I have an immune concern. If I wake up with arunny nose, sore throat or anything that might indicate I am going to develop a cold I get myself adjusted multiple times a daythat rst day. I have been able to do that all but a couple of times in the last 21 years and every time I could I woke up the nextday with no symptoms at all. I also ate extra well, avoided coffee and alcohol, got some extra sun, put the probiotics up mynose and the other tools I have described above, but even before I developed those strategies getting adjusted multiple timesa day that rst day has kept me from needing to take a single sick day for over 20 years now. In Conclusion Almost everything we are being instructed to do right now might be strategies designed to help slow or stop the transmission ofCoronavirus from one person to another but, unfortunately are also things that work against our own immune systems.Foremost, is the constant fear that is being generated that pushes people into a Fight and Flight state, during which your bodyintentionally suppresses its immune system. This Fight and Flight vs. Rest and Digest system was intended for scenarioswhere you were ghting for your life against some form of predator and in those situations a germ was not a very big concern,yet. If you got eaten by the predator germs no longer matter and your immune system requires a good bit of energy to run anddecreasing immune function frees up at energy some more muscle activity so that you can ght harder or flea faster. Stress isone of the most potent immune suppressors there is, and our media has become a fear and stress centered machine as thatincreases viewership and, therefore, revenue. Isolating ourselves also increases this Fight and Flight stress response. Notbeing able to work and earn a living, not being able to freely travel, go to the restaurant/bar, not being able to nd necessitieslike toilet paper, milk and eggs all keep pushing us into Fight and Flight and suppress our immune systems. Sanitizingeverything with Lysol and Purell and other disinfectants not only kill germs on the surfaces, breathing in the fumes from thosedisinfectants also damage our microbiome in our nose, sinuses and lungs; the very places that the coronavirus infects. Eatingnonperishables because we are trying to not have to go out where the carriers might be instead of fresh food also weakens ourimmune systems. I doubt we will ever see any statistics on how many cases of COVID were caused by trying to avoid COVID,but it would be very interesting to see so we could learn for the future. I see a lot of people online having very visceral reactions to the idea that anyone would do anything other than quarantinebecause they or someone they love are immunocompromised. Of course we all care for, and about, those people and theirloved ones, but it is worth remembering that we are also putting others at risk from the lifestyle changes that are coming withquarantining healthy people. There is no option that won't put someone at risk and everyone will chose the option that protectsthem the best. Perhaps the best thing we can do is try to remember the other person's view and that it's not just an issue ofinconvenience for any of us. What I will do during all of this is to remember that the one thing I have control over is how well I care for myself and that is mybest protection anyway. I hope you nd a way to do that too. Eat well, move a lot, hydrate, release stress, rest up, keep yourVitamin D up, keep your microbiome strong and stay well adjusted. With care, Steve Ranicki, DC Home About Why Chiropractic v What To Expect v Podcasts @ 11 D News Update - March 31st, 2020 In response to the \"Stay Home Stay Safe\" order that was issued on Wednesday, March 25th in Buncombe county, governor Cooper has declared that chiropractic offices be considered ESSENTIAL PROVIDERS. This means that we will remain open and ready to serve you and your family throughout this time . At Radius Chiropractic, our number one priority has always been the health and safety of our patients. In times of uncertainty, there can be a wealth of misinformation that spreads, especially in today's digital age. As a leading healthcare authority in our community, we wanted to reach out to all of our patients regarding the COVID-19 virus, and to let you know the steps we are taking to alleviate any potential concerns. According to the latest reports from the CDC and other national healthcare providers, the current health risks are minimal for most age groups. We recommend that all of our patients wash their hands frequently, avoid close contact with people who are sick, and stay home if you aren't feeling well. At Radius Chiropractic, we follow strict cleaning policies for the protection of both our staff and our patients. Each staff member maintains rigorous personal hygiene standards when preparing for every patient interaction. We use hospital-grade disinfectants across the entire office, with extensive room cleaning after each patient to ensure a safe and clean environment. These processes have always been of utmost importance in our office and will continue to be the standards we uphold for our community. Please rest assured that we are following local and national updates daily, and will continue to maintain the highest level of safety and patient care that you have come to expect. If you have any questions regarding your future appointments, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. Please advise us if you have traveled internationally in the last 14 days or have been in close contact with another person who has been diagnosed with or under investigation for COVID-19, and whether you have a cough, fever or shortness of breath. News Alert A lot has happened in the last few days and weeks. Radius Chiropractic is a leader in the entire profession of chiropractic. Thankfully we have many practices already in place to make sure our office is clean and sanitary. Below is an update of what we are doing internally and what you can be doing to keep your immune system strong. We WILL be open and ready to serve everyone! First: BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM ~ i You should be focusing on boosting your immune system. At home you can eat less refined white sugar, less processed food and more healthy whole foods, drink more water and get as much sunlight as you can :). As far as Chiropractic, now more than ever, you should be getting ADJUSTED! Typically, patients on a maintenance schedule will be able to hold their chiropractic adjustments from 1-3 weeks, depending on stress levels. However, in times of immune system suppression, a patient can have their spine examined for misalignments several times per week to ensure their nervous system is free of interference. ~ White blood cells, which eat and destroy bad cells, are enhanced through chiropractic care. 1 ,I. ,l,Science has shown that getting adjusted boosts the immune system!,I, ,I, j \u00b7 \u00b7 t The chief of cancer prevention at New York's Preventative Medicine Institute found that people who received regular chiropractic care over a five-year period had a 200% greater immune competence than those who had not received chiropractic care. The chiropractic group showed a 400% greater immune competence than people with cancer and other serious diseases . 2 Meet Dr. Priestley Meet the Team Chiropractic Care Contact 11,..., Priestley Family Chiropractic ----P---- serving the Newport Beach and Corona Del Mar areas since 1980. Upcoming Events Testimonials New Patient Center An Update For Our Chiropractic Family On COVID-19 YES, WE ARE SEEING PATIENTS! FROM 7AM - 11AM I MON - THURS SEE OUR POLICY CHANGES IMPLEMENTED TO KEEP YOU SAFE. Priestley Family Chiropractic- Just like you, we are closely monitoring new developments regarding COVID-19 (Coronavirus). There is no higher priority to our entire Priestley Family Chiropractic than the Health and Wellbeing of our Patients and Team. To that end, we are taking the appropriate preventative measures to address COVID-19 (Coronavirus), assuring that our protocols meet or exceed the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and local Health authorities and staying current on this evolving situation. We will work to keep Priestley Family Chiropractic open for all who want to maintain a healthy nervous and immune system. Chiropractic Services represent an essential and necessary component of the health care program of millions of patients of all ages and all walks of life in the United States and worldwide. Timely and consistent access to chiropractic care is essential to the maintenance of the health and wellbeing of this patient population, particularly during times of stress. We understand stress can affect the immune system. Taking steps to reduce your stress in a healthy way is important. What We Are Doing Differently: We have further enhanced our already strict cleaning procedures. Front Desk We are constantly sanitizing our hard surface areas and chairs after every patient coming through the doors. Check-In Area We have removed the high-touch self check-in at the front desk. Our team will check in for you! All you have to do is wait to be assigned to a table and lay down. Our trays are behind the desk and sanitized after each use. Healing Area We have spread out the chairs in the office to maintain a social distance. There are chairs outside in the hallway as well. All chairs are sanitized after every patient. We are sanitizing all tables and hard surface areas after every patient too. Adjustment Time Please do not self check-in. Dr. Priestley is sanitizing after every patient and we will have the table cleaned and the face paper down for you. Again, all you have to do is lay down and be ready for your immune-boosting adjustment. We have also spread out our patients through the day. Kids Corner We have removed all toys in our Kids Corner. We apologize for the inconvenience. Rehab Area We have removed the blankets and closed the icing station to minimize the time spent in the office. We are offering ice packs for patient to ice at home. We also removed the cups and tea by the water cooler. Back Office We are, again, sanitizing all areas after contact with patients. We are very vigilant as the health and safety of our patients are our number one priority. Hand sanitizers are located throughout the office and are refilled and checked regularly. These policies have always been in place at Priestley Family Chiropractic and provide our Patients peace of mind every day. How to Protect Yourself: Wash Your Hands You've likely heard this a million times but get ready to make it 1,000,001- you must wash your hands frequently. Simple hand-washing with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds is your first line of defense from germs and is key to protecting yourself. Eat Right A healthy immune system starts in your gut. A balanced diet full of whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and. healthy fats will keep the good bacteria in your gut happy. This microbiome is one of your body's first lines of defense when it's exposed to germs, so keep them healthy and you wil I keep yourself healthy too.It's a good idea to cut down on added sugars because they can throw off the balance of good and bad bacteria in your gut. Make sure you stay well hydrated, too. It certainly doesn't hurt to increase your intake of Vitamin C, either as a food source or supplement, or Vitamin D, which you can get from a few minutes in the sun, fortified foods, or as a supplement. Sleep Well It may be difficult to get a good night's rest when you're worried about pandemics, but if you're not getting a minimum of seven to eight hours of sleep each night, then you're doing your body (and immune system) a serious disservice. When you sleep, your body uses the time to rest and rejuvenate. Sleep is integral to your overall health and wellness, so make sure you're getting enough of it.If you find that you have trouble sleeping, then check your sleep environment. The room should be cool, dark, and quiet. Also take a look at your nighttime routine, making sure that all electronics are turned off at least one hour before bed and you're doing what you can to relax in that time to prepare your body for sleep. Scrolling through social media and reading about recent outbreaks probably isn't going to help you get the sleep you need, so turn it off and tune it out. See the Chiropractor Chiropractic care focuses on the function of the central nervous system, which just so happens to regulate every single function in your body - including your immune system . Regular chiropractic adjustments focus on the removal of spinal joint dysfunctions that can impact how your central nervous system communicates with the rest of your body. When your body is able to communicate freely and efficiently, then every system can work optimally to help you stay healthy. You cannot control the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) - or the flu or common cold either! What you can control are the things you do to support your own health. There's no new way to outsmart a virus, all you can do is go back to the basics to help you stay healthy. Thank you for your patience and trust in Priestley Family Chiropractic. We are committed to navigating through these difficult circumstances with your health and safety at the forefront of everything we do. Thank you for being part of our Family, and we look forward to seeing you soon! 1J ... Kevin F. Priestley, D.C. Chief Executive Officer In response to recent COVID-19 concerns, we are writing to assure our clients that we are taking recommended precautions and following all CDC guidelines. :E -~MENU' -------------------------~, Call' Toaa=y: -'. ,-,---:~~-_--,-:-v\u00b7r--,---\u00b7 Virus support in San Luis Obispo - Raise your immune system :\\\\ RSS Feed Corona Virus support in San Luis Obispo - Raise your immune system ~ posted: Mar 12, 2020. As you are aware the Corona Virus is taking over our daily headlines across the nation and world. The sensational reports tend to focus on tragedies and the ultimate reality that sicknesses can be deadly. As a health professional , I would like provide you some additional realities and facts as well in hopes to alleviate some of your fear. The coronavirus is a common virus that causes an infection in the nose, sinuses, or upper throat. Most corona viruses do not accompany the deadly outcomes catching media headlines. And as we all know, the body's enemies take on MANY forms -stress, seasonal changes, environmental contaminants. We can't make the immune system invincible to these pressures, but we can make it more prepared. Now, to the important part: WHAT YOU CAN DO 1) Stay on track with adjustments to keep the autonomic nervous system in balance. Research from 2010 determined that patients who received Chiropractic adjustments showed increased levels of a specific signaling molecule in the body called lnterleukin-2. lnterleukin-2 regulates the activities of white blood cells which are responsible for immunity. 2) Consume high quality, doctor trusted immune boosters. Congaplex is used for short -term support of the immune system.* Echinacea Premium combines the roots of Echinacea angustifolia and Echinacea purpurea , herbs traditionally used to enhance healthy immune system function.* lmmuplex blends essential micronutrients and minerals as well as Protomorphogen TM and Cytosol extracts to support the immune system* 3) Add 30-60 minutes of extra sleep to the daily routine. Inadequate sleep depletes immunity. 4) Drink water and remove sugary drinks and snacks from the diet. Sugar drains immunity. 5) Move the body. Exercise increases lymphatic flow and provides significant immune benefits. 6) Wait for it .... WASH YOUR HANDS! But seriously, for 20 seconds or more. Use hand sanitizer between washes. Avoid touching your mouth, eyes or nose with unclean hands. Though we can't make the immune system invincible to these pressures, we can make it more prepared. Powersource Chiropractic offers a number of additional products that support your immune systems and we would like to be part of your IMMUNE BOOSTING TEAM! :: MENU Call Today: Blog > Boost Your Immune System from the Coronavirus Boost Your Immune System from the Coronavirus ~ posted: Mar 31, 2020. Standard Process :\\\\ RSS Feed Just as with any other flu season , certain people are at greater risk. These populations include the elderly, those with compromised immune systems, and this year, those with weakened lungs or severe cardiovascular disease. So what can you do to protect yourself and your family while the pandemonium is happening around you? Here are my best recommendations , and what I'm doing myself , so you can give yourself and your loved ones the IMMUNE BOOST it needs! Carefully watch your diet, stay away from sugar, wash your hands, get as much sleep as possible, get your spinal check-ups, and get moving--Exercise helps tune up your immune system as well. Understanding Viruses & Beating Them! Some viruses have an envelope around them that prevents the immune system from targeting and destroying it. Certain herbs can help break down and dissolve this envelope, allowing your immune system to target, attack , and destroy. I recommend Viranon, which is a combination of St. John's Wort and Thuja for this. Echinacea as the best way to boost and up -regulate the immune system but beware .... not all echinacea products are alike. And if you are really concerned or at a higher risk, I would suggest adding the following two supplements: Thymex -which he lps the thymus gland make more killer T cells lmmuplex -literally a multivitamin for your immune system to ally against viral and bacterial threats! Finally, ABSOLUTELY NO SUGAR!!! This reduces your immune function by 50% or more for at least 30 minutes after ingesting. Instead, focus on an abundance of greens, nuts, and seeds to provide even more of those essential immune-fighting nutrients in your body! We are open for business.

And while the media tends to focus on tragedies and the misconception that sicknesses are always fatal, this is not the full picture. In reality, the coronavirus is a common virus that causes an infection in the nose, sinuses, and/or the upper throat or respiratory system. Most coronaviruses are not deadly, especially to people with a healthy, well-functioning immune system[1]. People who have been infected with the coronavirus are reporting coughs, fever, and respiratory issues, with some extreme cases involve pneumonia. Antibiotics do not work against the coronavirus, and the recovery from coronavirus primarily relies on the strength of the person's immune system. The best weapon for the coronavirus, the cold and the flu all begins with building a strong, proactive immune system. The immune cells, our amazing red and white blood cells, work hard to heal and defend the body against foreign invaders like coronavirus. The most amazing part of this defensive process comes from the way the body adapts and responds naturally and without us having to direct it to do so. And this entire process of adaptation and immune response operates under the direction of our central nervous system. Scientists found out long ago the amazing connection between the central nervous system and the immune system and continue to gather evidence about this amazing natural healing process. \"Chiropractic plays a key role because of the spine's relationship with immunity.\" [2] Research shows that when the spine is misaligned, the body exists in a heightened state of stress similar to being in a warzone. Operating in a heightened state of stress weakens us and reduces the quality of our rest, immunity, and growth within the nervous system. Gentle, low force chiropractic adjustments improve our body's immunity by allowing the nervous system to function at its best for optimum healing and repair. Evidence demonstrates that people who receive regular chiropractric adjustments report stronger immunity after starting chiropractic care. \"Research from 2010 determined that patients who received Chiropractic adjustments showed increased levels of a specific signaling molecule in the body called Interleukin -2. Interleukin -2 regulates the activities of white blood cells which are responsible for immunity. The molecule impacts the body's natural response to microbial infection and helps the body recognize and create specific responses that neutralize foreign invaders. This protein molecule was found to be higher in those who received chiropractic spinal adjustments when compared to those who did not.\"[3] The primary purpose of a chiropractic adjustment does not center on treating a specific symptom or condition, but rather, treating the whole body through the alignment of the nervous system. \"The increased health and function from an adjustment represents an outcome which originates when interference is removed from the nervous system.\" [4] While other health professions focus on changing the environment to suit a weakened body, for example, by prescribing medications, Chiropractic works at strengthening the body to better suit its environment! How can you achieve this? Follow the 5 Steps to improving your immunity: 1) Make sure to get regular adjustments to maintain your autonomic nervous system's balance. 2) Take adequate amounts of Vitamin D, which is a major immune booster. 3) Get an additional 30-60 minutes of sleep in your daily routine. Inadequate sleep reduces immunity. 4) Drink lots of water and remove sugary drinks and foods from your and your family's diet. Sugar depletes immunity. 5) Move your body every day. Exercise increases your body's lymphatic flow and provides significant immune benefits.

About Treatments Corporate Events 7 EASY STEPS FOR PREVENTING CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) With the Coronavirus dropping the world into a state of fear, let's shed light on a hopeful, educational, and guided way to increase your chances of avoiding and not becoming infected with the coronavirus. Experts agree, and from my 15+ years of practical experience I can say the fundamental key to fending off any virus, including COVID -19, is a strong immune SY-Stem. Yes, Coronavirus is not our average winter flu, it is deadlier and it spreads faster -but the basics remain the same. The dampened immune systems of millions of people in a world full of constant stress is why this pandemic has spread so fast. Now it is at our doorsteps in NYC. Good news: you can take action today to increase your chance of not becoming the next victim. The fact is, by boosting and strengthening your immune system right now, you can almost STOP any virus from entering your body (not just COVI D-19). First, start with increasing your intake of green vegetables, water, exercising, washing your hands frequently, and decreasing your stress levels. Remember, stress has 4 components, and focusing on the holistic combination of physical, chemical, emotional and mental stresses -not just getting more sleep -is crucial. More than 1,000 patients in my 15+ years of practice have followed my custom guidelines for boosting their immune system and maximizing their overall health. Patients have reported excellent results, with less vulnerability to sickness compared to others in their surroundings. Now I am sharing them with you. To boost and strengthen your immune system to fight off Coronavirus, follow my tips on the backside! WHEN YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM IS STRONG, LITTLE CAN GO WRONG!

During this time we will not have our team in the office , will not be seeing new patients or doing re-evaluations, and we will only allow 5 adjustments every 15 minutes. This will allow people to get in and out quickly with limited contact with others. We will still be sanitizing tables after every adjustment and door handles every 30 minutes . Because of the limited availability of these adjustment only hours, we will need you to be at your adjustment at your appointed time rather than our usual flexibility of allowing you to come early , or late. These added hours are : Tuesday: SAM-1 OAM Friday: SAM-1 OAM You are still welcome to come during our normal business hours as we will be taking all necessary precautions during those times as well , including our new virtual waiting room (see next box for detai Is). These extra hours will help us spread patients out more so that we can continue to have 10 or fewer people in the office at one time, as well as give us a dedicated time where we can safely see the immune compromised and elderly. Extra Precautions During Normal Hours 1) We are introducing our new, virtual, waiting room! Want to limit your exposure? Just text a reply to your SKED appointment reminder message when you're here, or call us at 81 3-43 8-6348 when you' re parked and we'll check you in and let you know when your room is ready for your adjustment! 2) We are sanitizing tables after every use and we are sanitizing counters, door handles, waiting room chairs, and other publicly used spaces every thirty minutes. 3) In order to ensure we never have more than 10 people in the office, we are reducing the number of chairs in our waiting room to 6 (since at any given time we have at least 3 team members and 1 new patient here). If you'd like to wait inside and the chairs are empty, you'll know you're good to go! If the chairs are full, feel free to come in and check in, then wait outside the door until someone leaves. 4) We will be opening and closing 15 minutes earlier/later in order to space out the appointments at our busiest times of the day. 5) UTILIZE YOUR SKED APP. We are reducing the number of allowed appointments to be scheduled at one time to six. If you open the opp and click your appointment time, then click the \"reschedule\" button in the bottom right hand side of the screen, it will pull up a calendar with all our available times. If there is a green line under it, it is a time where not many people are scheduled. If it is yellow, it's slightly busy. If it's red, it's very busy. Many times you can avoid longer wait times and crowds by simply moving your appointment forward or back by 15 minutes. Did You Know? During the 191 8 Flu Pandemic, it is reported that chiropractors had so much success in helping people combat the flu that they had 1 / 40th the death rate that medical doctors were seeing. In fact, many MDs started referring their patients to chiropractors. This success is what ultimately led to chiropractic becoming an officially licensed profession.

Chiropractic care is an important part of our clients' wellness-strategy and we are here to serve you. We also offer Virtual Care appointments. Please click below for more information on Virtual Care. CLICK HERE As essential healthcare workers we are here to serve you during COVID-19. We are following and exceeding all DC Department of Health and CDC recommendations to ensure the safety of our patients and staff. We have taken action and put in place the following protocols: We reduced scheduling to less than half our standard frequency. We are scheduling only one client in the office at time. This creates social distancing, eliminates wait time, and give us extra time to sanitize between patients. We sanitize with anti-bacterial wipes all surfaces touched by our clients after each visit. That includes the chiropractic tables, the hydro table, the therapeutic exercise equipment, dressing rooms, front desk, doorknobs and other commonly touched areas. Dr. Noya is wearing an N95 mask during treatment of all patients. The front desk and physical therapy room are equipped with hand sanitizers and ask that patients use hand sanitizers upon arriving and before leaving each location. We have eliminated the self-check-in procedure. We have increased the frequency of our professional office cleaning. We will not accept any walk-in appointments as it may increase waiting time and decrease social distancing. We ask that any clients who have a cough, fever, or any other flu-like symptoms to remain at home. If you have traveled to a region of high incidents or have a known exposure, please do not visit the office for at least 14 days. We also want to remind everyone that now more than ever, it is essential to support your body to maintain a healthy immune system.Here are some tips that we recommend: Get sufficient sleep: It can't be overstated how critical getting enough sleep is for your health and staying well. Aim for at least 7-8 hours/night. Eat fresh whole foods: lots of greens, healthy fats, and quality proteins. Exercise daily - every measurable health metric improves with regular exercise. Avoid sugar and processed vegetable oils - these foods weaken your body in general and your immune system in particular. Take at least 5 grams of vitamin C daily (best is the ascorbate form instead of the ascorbic acid). Remember, too, that Probiotics are a first line of defense within the body's immune system. Get regular chiropractic care.The integration between the nervous system and the immune system is critical for proper/optimal health and healing. Numerous studies have demonstrated the link between regular chiropractic care and improved immune function. Follow the common-sense recommendations such as regularly washing your hands, avoiding touching your face, etc. We are here to provide support and guidance.Please feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns.

MORE INFO ama COVID-79 Dear Patient of The Natural Health Center, As your healthcare partner, we want you to know that your safety is always our top priority and we are taking the recent outbreak of the coronavi rus (COVI D-19) very seriously. Knowledge Is Power -Things To Know About The Coronavirus Per the CDC (Center for Disease Control), there is still much to learn about the virus, but Coronavirus spreads through contact with respiratory droplets caused by coughing. It is spread from person-to-person and happens most frequently among close contacts (within about 6 feet). This type of transmission occurs via respiratory droplets. Transmission of the coronavirus to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVI D-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in households and community settings. What We Are Doing To Keep Our Patients Safe We take this situation very seriously and have been closely monitoring each update. For us, that means following the guidance issued by the World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control. We are cleaning and disinfecting regularly, specifically we practice routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces (for example: treatment tables, pens, doorknobs, light switches, desks, faucets, sinks) with cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants that are appropriate for the surface. Our providers will continue to sanitize their hands before and after treating each patient. The treatment tables will be sanitized after/before each patient. We have set up antibacterial stations throughout the office. We ask that you use these as you come into the office. Regarding our staff members, we can confirm that none of our employees have traveled outside of the country in the past several months. Out of an abundance of caution, any of our team members that feel symptoms of a cold or fever, will not be coming into the office. Take Steps To Protect Yourself 1. Don't weaken Your Immune System Get enough sleep Drink plenty of water Don't eat sugar (this will weaken your immune system) Don't eat many carbohydrates (carbs turn into sugar, which weakens your immune system) 2. Don't weaken Your Immune System Wash your hands frequently with soap for at least 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizer when soap is not readily available. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands Avoid close contact with people that are sick Boost Your Immune System & Protect Yourself Against The CoronaVirus Chiropractic Adjustments: Spinal adjustments have been shown to boost immune function because they serve to correct the spinael misalignments that cause neural dysfunction. Even one adjustment can bring about an immediate immune boost. A chiropractic 1\u00a21 adjustment isn't the only way to increase your immune function, but it can vastly help. We are open for business. We are an essential health care facility not subject to closure. Click Here For More Information 9 1150 Murrieta Blvd. Suite 100 Livermore , CA 94550 I \\.

Receive regular frequent chiropractic adjustments (according to Dr. Donald Pero's, PH. D., Chief of Research at New York's Preventative Medical Institute and Professor of Medicine at New York University). Dr. Pero's research study of 107 individuals who received long term chiropractic care chiropractic patients had a remarkable 200% greater immune competence than those who didn't receive chiropractic care. Despite a wide range of ages in this study, immune competence did not show any decline with age and remained uniform for the entire group. It is for this reason that new patients are encouraged to keep their chiropractic appointments to increase their immune system defenses and protect against all infectious diseases. Existing patients are encouraged to keep their adjustment appointments and to consider an increase in their frequency in their adjustments to maximize their immune and nervous system function. 2. COVID-19 clinic protocols involve social distancing during your clinic visit. Our large indoor and outdoor reception area allows for 6 feet distance between patients entering and exiting our clinic.

We hope this month's newsletter will inspire you and your family to keep on the path toward realizing your highest levels of health. Have a great month! Is the COVID-19 virus a real problem? How bad is it and how bad could it get? What can you do to prepare or prevent? In the past week I have spoken to several friends who are epidemiologists and infectious disease experts about the COVID-19 virus and what is happening in America and around the world. They said the virus is a real concern and a legitimate health hazard for a certain percentage of our population. He explained, because we have so many unhealthy Americans who currently take daily medications for a variety of health problems, we could see many people become seriously ill or die. Not because this particular viral strain is extremely dangerous, but because we have so many people who are already ill (but don't think they are) because they are \"taking their prescription medications from their doctor.\" My pathologist friend said those are the people who really need to take precautions. Having said that, 98% of people who are not immunosuppressed with drugs or chronic disease will be just fine even after exposure to the virus. They explained to me that COVID virus strains have been identified since the 1980's and most people have already prior exposure to the virus in the past. You could have had a cold, sinus or respiratory infection five or ten years ago and thought nothing of it. You never got tested and you developed natural immunity to COVID strains years ago. They told me most of America will either have had prior exposure or current exposure and develop immunity without ever even knowing it. We are exposed to thousands of bacteria, viruses, mold, fungus, etc., each and every day of our lives. If we are practicing even modestly healthy choices, we will never even notice feeling sick at all. If our immune system becomes overwhelmed, our body will give us clues to rest/sleep, hydrate, alter our eating patterns, and we will develop natural immunity in a few days. Life goes on again. Whether a person gets sick or not is not dependent on the actual virus itself. Sick or well comes down to \"individual host immunity.\" How healthy are you? Rather than talking about how many people are going to get sick or die, the focus needs to be on how to stay well. Dr. James Chestnut explained, we will never be able to completely isolate humanity away from breathing air or contact with other people. Regardless of social distancing, most people will be exposed to the virus in the next 3-6 weeks. Most already have been. So, what do we do? Keep it simple. Healthy people make healthy daily choices. Unhealthy people don't. Healthy people don't need daily medications. Unhealthy people do. Healthy people don't get sick. Unhealthy people do. Bacteria and viruses are known as \"environmental opportunistic organisms.\" Meaning they need a suitable host environment to grow and replicate. They need a run down, stressed out, unhealthy immune system to grow in. They need a person who regularly chooses less than optimal health practices. Making unhealthy choices locked away in your own home vs. making unhealthy choices in public doesn't make you \"safer.\" Isolation is just better than exposing other unwise people to your unhealthy host environment. So, if that's you, stop your unhealthy choices for a few weeks and begin to do what we know works. Here's what we know works for healthy people: Eat real foods that God designed for humans to thrive on. MORE: Vegetables, fruits, grass-fed meats, nuts, seeds and pure non-chemical water. (Kangen water if possible) LESS: Sugar in all it's forms. LESS: Grains and dairy products. Sugar, wheat, and dairy all create an environment that viruses like. Socially distance yourself from these bad choices as much as possible. Move in ways God designed for humans to move. MORE: Get full body exercise every day. Bend, twist, turn, flex, extend, lift, push, pull and take every joint through its full range of motion. MORE: Get adjusted: make sure your body is subluxation free. There is substantial research showing by keeping your nervous system stress free you maximize immune function. LESS: Sitting - especially if it's in front of electronic devices that cause you to be stressed. Think, act and communicate in the way that God designed for humans to grow. MORE: Loving, encouraging, and empowering messages. Keep your mind focused on who created you and how you wonderfully are made. Knowledge and certainty create strength. LESS: FEAR. Fear is the number one immunosuppressor that science has ever identified. Fear puts humans in a fight or flight state, which automatically inhibits your viral and bacterial immune system. If your \"social isolation\" means sitting at home googling how many people are going to die or watching television and listening to politicians give you health advice, you may want to alter your choices before you create the \"suitable host environment for disease.\" Be respectful of the virus by changing your daily choices to healthy ones, not by locking yourself in your house. If you don't want to practice the above 3 suggested ways to stay well, then you should be very worried about your health and practice social isolation. Supplements? There are many natural choices that you can add to your health arsenal to help keep you safe from viral infections. The following are a few easy to implement suggestions: We are open for business.

We OFFER WAYS TO HELP YOU IN THE defense against the Coronavirus and we are taking extraordinary measures and precautions to keep our patients safe. Have you ever wondered why only 1 or 2 family members catch a cold when there are 5 family members living in the same house? The majority of the time it is because those 1 or 2 family members immune system may have been compromised or under stress at the time of exposure to the virus. We are exposed to viruses and bacteria on a daily basis. Why aren't we always sick from these exposures? @DeMaioChiro Our bodies build active immunity against germs constantly; however, if your immune system is not healthy you may become ill. If you have not been exposed to a specific pathogen you could have become ill as a result of first time exposure. This is especially true if your immune system is not functioning well or is compromised. What can we do to protect ourselves from the Coronavirus? Following sanitary practices; such as-washing your hands/hand sanitizers, wiping down surfaces with disinfectant, getting regular sleep and reducing stress are precautionary steps we can all take. What else can I do to protect myself? An extremely important step we can all take now is to STRENGTHEN OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM. 0 What brings you here today': A healthy immune system is A PROACTIVE APPROACH to protect yourself from the Coronavirus. 0 Ii www.denver-chiropractor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/0 3/C 0 The coronavirus claims daily headlines across the nation and world. The sensational reports tend to focus on tragedies and the ultimate reality that sicknesses can be deadly. Other positive realities and facts exist as well. The coronavirus is a common virus that causes an infection in the nose, sinuses, or upper throat. Most coronaviruses do not accompany the deadly outcomes catching media headlines. People infected with the coronavirus report coughs, fever, and respiratory issues. Some extreme cases involve pneumonia. Antibiotics do not work against this viral attack on the immune system. Recovery primarily involves the strength of the immune system. The best weapon for the coronavirus and the flu begins with building a strong, proactive immune system. One drop of blood contains five million red blood cells, seven thousand white blood cells, and thousands of platelets. These cells work feverishly to heal and defend the body against foreign invaders. The most amazing element of the process comes from the fact that the body adapts and responds naturally and without a conscious decision to do so. The entire process of adaptation and response operates under the direction of the central nervous system. Scientists discovered the unique connection between the central nervous system and the immune system and continue to compile research and evidence about the process. Chiropractic plays a key role because of the spine's relationship with immunity. Research shows that when the spine remains immobile of misaligned, the body operates in a heightened state of stress equivalent to being in battle. Operating in a heightened state of stress weakens rest, immunity, and growth within the nervous system. Gentle Chiropractic adjustments improve immunity by allowing the nervous system to function at maximum capacity for healing and repair. Chiropractic adjustments increase movement and improve alignment while reducing stress. Evidence shows that people who receive regular adjustments report stronger immunity after beginning Chiropractic care. Research from 2010 determined that patients who received Chiropractic adjustments showed increased levels of a specific signaling molecule in the body called lnterleukin-2. lnterleukin-2 regulates the activities of white blood cells which are responsible for immunity. The molecule impacts the body's natural response to microbial infection and helps the body recognize and create specific responses that neutralize foreign invaders. This protein molecule was found to be higher in those who received Chiropractic spinal adjustments when compared to those who did not. The primary focus of a Chiropractic adjustment does not center on treating a specific symptom or condition. The increased health and function from an adjustment represents an outcome which originates when interference is removed from the nervous system. While other professions focus on changing the environment to suit a weakened body, Chiropractic pursues strengthening the body to suit the environment. Four Keys to Improving Immunity: 1) Stay on track with adjustments to keep the autonomic nervous system in balance. 2) Consume adequate amounts of Vitamin D, a major immune booster.

But don't exercise too much: more than 90 minutes per day could make you more susceptible. Three: Sleep Well! Getting a good night sleep is essential for the immune system to recharge. If your body is fatigued, you have a poor chance of fighting off infections. Shoot for 7-8 hours of pure sleep per night! Four: Take Probiotics & Eat Healthy! Probiotics are \"good\" bacteria that can help your body stay healthy and protect it from \"bad\" bacteria. Vitamins including A, B6, C, and E, and minerals including zinc, iron, copper, and selenium have been shown to improve immune system function. Your diet should consist of a rainbow of fruits and vegetables, with extra citrus especially if you do get sick. Try Elderberry syrup and Ocillococinum to naturally boost your immune system at the first signs of illness or before! Five: Get Adjusted! We all know that getting adjusted helps to improve symptoms from aches and pains but chiropractic care boosts your immune system each time you get adjusted! When you're under the weather, there is no better time to come in for an adjustment. Studies have shown getting adjusted improves your immune system by 200-400% each time you come in!

DrlH Home About Us Meet Dr. Tom Georges Chiropractic Care New Patients Boosting Your Immune Function To Protect Yourself From Disease and Infections PUBLISHED ON MARCH 12, 2020 I Though it should be taken seriously, COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus is only one of a slew of viruses spreading around this winter in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control has issued infection prevention habits to curb the spread of the virus around our communities. These recommendations include washing your hands with soap and warm water for 20 seconds or more and avoiding going out when you are feeling ill. These recommendations only scratch the surface of disease spread and prevention. Our body has a powerful ability to identify and manage foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria. The immune system is a complicated and elegant process that, when functioning correctly, can keep germs from multiplying and spreading and causing serious complications . We want to add to the CDC list of disease prevention habits with some additional recommendations for maintaining or improving our body's natural, healthy immune response. Taking measures to maintain a healthy immune system not only prevents severe complications from viruses like COVID-19 but also ensures that we are healthy and robust to take care of others who might not be able to fight off infections. Stay Hydrated Water is essential for life; it makes up the vast majority of our bodies. Without water, humans can survive only four (4) days. Becoming dehydrated not only impacts your physical functioning, but it also can have adverse effects on mood and mental functioning. Being fully hydrated helps your liver, kidneys, and gastrointestinal system function properly so that your body can flush out toxins and infections . To ensure you are staying adequately hydrated, make it a point to have 8-10 full glasses (8 oz) or more of water each day. Eat Healthy Foods It's easy to slip into a comfort food habit when we are feeling stress or are locked up in our houses watching a neverending news cycle. Instead of reaching for those chips in the pantry, that candy hidden in the drawer, or ordering that pizza for delivery, focus on eating as many fruits and vegetables as you can into your daily meals. The more color and variety, the better for your immune system. The vegetables and fruits of our diets offer essential vitamins and minerals that support our body's immune function and immune response. Reduce Stress There is no longer any question that our minds and our bodies are linked, and that stress (whether real or perceived) has a negative effect on health and immune function. We know it's easier said than done, but try not to \"worry\" about the spread of COVID-19. The act of worrying doesn't benefit you unless that \"worry\" instinct is quickly transformed into action to take care of yourself, your family, and your community. Blog Contact Us Connect with Us! D Recent Newsletters May 2020 -Flexibility With Morning Stretches April 2020 -Staying Safe Ar Healthy During Coronavirus March 2020 -Natural Help For Carpal Tunnel Studies have shown that a higher level of daily stress increases the risk of disease as much as smoking and poor diets. Don't be fooled that your ability to \"handle\" stress means you don't have stress. Just because you can stay productive in the face of stressful situations or feelings doesn't mean that the adverse effects of stress aren't felt by your body. Take measures now to reduce unnecessary stressors in your environment. If the news or the internet is raising your stress level, then it isn't doing you much good to \"stay in the know,\" instead turn off the TV and put away your phones. If you have to check-in, then do so only at certain times of the day and only for a prescribed period (15 minutes). Find time for quiet and allow your mind and your body to relax. Take a nap or meditate for 15 minutes. These periods of stress reduction can work wonders for your immune system and for your ability to respond clearly and effectively to real stressors that show up in your daily life. Move Around, Elevate Your Heart Rate Your routines might change in the face of a viral outbreak such as COVID-19, but don't let that disruption in routine impact your regular exercise routine. Moving around and elevating the heart rate will keep your circulation moving. A healthy circulation goes a long way towards responding to and eliminating infections and toxins from the body. Get Enough Sleep You may already notice that you catch colds more easily if you haven't been sleeping well. This should be your first hint that getting enough sleep has positive effects on your immune system. Not sleeping enough also increases stress hormones in the body, and we already know what stress can do to your immune system. Most people should shoot for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. To help your body get to sleep, reduce your exposure to blue lights from phones and computers for 1 hour before bedtime. Also, avoid eating within two hours of bedtime to prevent GI distress from interrupting your sleep. Lastly, try to keep your regular sleep habits even if other routines have flown out the window. Go to bed and wake up at generally the same time every day. Supplements There is some evidence that various micronutrient deficiencies -for example, deficiencies of zinc, selenium, iron, copper, folic acid, and vitamins A, B6, C, and E -alter immune responses. So what can you do? If you suspect your diet is not providing you with all your micronutrient needs- for instance, you don't get enough fruits and vegetables -taking a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement may bring other health benefits, beyond any possibly beneficial effects on the immune system. Get Adjusted Put simply, the better your body is functioning overall, the better your immune system can work to protect you. In addition to reducing pain and discomfort and improving the body's ability to move, chiropractic care and spinal manipulations specifically have been shown to enhance the immune activity, improve communication between the immune and nervous systems, and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines. Taking action now to boost or support your immune system will not only help you to fight off infections like COVID-19 but will also help to improve overall health and wellbeing. Combining these immune\u00ad boosting practices and the CDC recommendations for infection control are your key to keeping your self, your family, and your community healthy.

Those are all good habits to help protect yourself against COVID-19. However , there's another important step you can take. Get a chiropractic adjustment. After all, chiropractic does much more than relieve back and neck pain; it helps you stave off serious illnesses. How Does Chiropractic Help? Chiropractic care removes interferences to the body 's capacity to resist illness and infection. \"The purpose of chiropractic care is to remove the interferences in the flow of energy that would shackle the nervous system's ability to carry energy to all parts of the body that control how well the body functions; ' said Dr. Freedman . When the body has interference in energy flow, it doesn 't perform as well. Since the immune system is one of the most critical functions of the body , the immune system is hindered in its ability to operate as well as it can . When that happens, the body is much more susceptible to illness. It becomes immune\u00ad compromised . All experts agree that when it comes to coronavirus, people who are most at risk are those who are immune-compromised . Add Chiropractic to Your Wellness Repertoire Here are things you should be doing to stay well: Eat a nutrient -dense diet Exercise Get proper rest Maintain a positive attitude Wash your hands for 20 seconds after being out in public Have regular chiropractic care Of course, getting chiropractic care is one of the most crucial things you can do .

Pure Chiropractic! Statement and Research PURE CHIROPRACTIC: Statement on COVID-19 Due to the notice of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Illinois, we wanted to update you on procedures we are implementing to keep you and your family safe during this time. Cleaning Measures: Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, our team members would disinfect the adjusting tables HowWe before and after shifts, and periodically throughout the day as needed. We have always had disinfectant wipes available to our Practice Members in the adjusting rooms. You are more than welcome to use these at any time. Due to the recent pandemic, we are now increasing our frequency of cleaning these adjusting tables to every 30 minutes, and taking extra precautions to clean all surfaces of our office throughout the day, including: door handles, keyboards, countertops, computer screens, etc. Each of our practice members have been instructed to place face paper down on the adjusting table prior to laying down for their adjustment. This regular use of face paper serves as an additional safety measure to protect the practice members that we serve. Education & Research: We understand that there is a swirl of anxiety and fear regarding the present situation. It is our goal to put you at ease amidst this global event. We have a host of resources in our office to help you better understand the vital role that chiropractic care has on your health and your immune system. What Can YOU Do Now to Protect Yourself: 1. GET ADJUSTED! It is now more important than ever to stay on track with your weekly chiropractic adjustments. PREVENTION of sickness and dis-ease is key! In fact. we have several practice members receiving extra adjustments this month, to boost their immune system. We are eager to keep you well-adjusted through this time. With specific, neurologically-based chiropractic care, should you contract any illness, your healing and recovery times will experience a boost. 2. STAY ACTIVE & MOVING! Movement is vital to proper immune function. Have you ever noticed how people tend to get more sick in the winter months? This is partially due to inactivity. Science shows that movement and active lifestyles increase immune function. Keep an active lifestyle through this time to promote better immune function. 3. AVOID FEAR & WORRY! Fear and worry leads to stress. Stress leads to decreased immune function. Don't allow fear to creep into your life and win. We don't want to minimize the seriousness of this global event, however we also recognize the need to keep ourselves as healthy as possible through this time, to maximize our health and body function. Utilize relaxation techniques to stay at ease, spend extra time enjoying life with your family and friends, think about the positive in every situation, and take action steps towards better health that you have control over. Should you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to email Dr. Erick directly at: erick.dobrzynski@gmail.com We are aware that this COVID-19 outbreak is an active and rapidly evolving situation. We will keep you up to date if there are any further changes in our procedures. Thank you for entrusting us with your health! In The Midst Of Fear And Panic Gripping Our World Because Of The CoronaVirus (COVID-19), It's Important To Remember That The Power That Made Your Body, Heals Your Body. Did You Realize That By Getting Adjusted And Having A Chiropractor Remove The Interference On Your Nervous System, You're Increasing Your Immune Response By 4 Fold, Or 400%? If we go far back into the history of chiropractic to the horrific 1917-1918 Spanish flu pandemic, you'll find that this drugless, non-surgical method of healing proved itself impressively! Based on historically documented evidence, many people found relief during the epidemic by visiting a chiropractor. We found this article on how chiropractors helped their patients during the 1918 Flu Pandemic that we thought you might also find interesting: The Official History Of Chiropractic in Texas bY. Walter R Rhodes, DC Published bY. the Texas ChiroRractic Association, 1978 . Here is an especially interesting quotation: \"When interviews of the old timers are made, it is evident that each still vividly remembers the 1917-1918 influenza epidemic. We now know about 20 million persons [recent estimates are as high as 100 million deaths] around the world died of the flu, with about 500,000 Americans among that number. But most chiropractors and their patients were miraculously spared, plus we repeatedly hear about those who decided to become a chiropractor after a remarkable recovery or when a close family member given up for dead suddenly came back to vibrant health.\" Chiropractic care became extremely popular after the 1918 Flu Pandemic. As Rhodes writes, 'The fabulous success of chiropractic in combating the 1917-1918 influenza outbreak was the public relations breakthrough that was desperately needed. Better acceptance by the public followed. Dedicated chiropractors came into the profession in increasing numbers and they had a sure sense of certainty, heady conviction, and a great willingness to fight for the cause.\" While many people associate going to the chiropractor with treating back or neck pain, there are more benefits that pain relief! Chiropractors think of treating the whole body, and getting chiropractic care can aid in your overall health, including improving your immune system. When your central nervous system is not functioning to its optimal capacity, your body will suffer. Keeping the spine in alignment allows all parts and systems of the body to function more effectively, helping support the immune system's ability to fight illness. If you know of a friend or family member who needs to be adjusted and get their immune system boosted, ask us about our current referral special !

Message From The Ohio State Chiropractic Association (OSCAJ: The OSCA understands what a difficult time this is for our country and our communities . We are thankful to support Ohio chiropractors who are showing up to their offices to treat their patients each day in the midst of all this uncertainty . The services you offer your patients are more important today than ever before. In a time where hospital and urgent care facilities are being inundated with sick people in need of life saving care, our doctors continue to provide chiropractic care for neuromusculoskeletal conditions, reducing the need for these patients to spill into a healthcare system that we know will to continue to be strained in ways not previously experienced. At this time, we keep all health professionals in high regard as they care for our sick community members and , as always, the OSCA Is proud of our Doctors of Chiropractic . To Our Local Health Care Providers: Over the years, our office has shared many patients with our local health care providers. Our nation is in crisis right now, and all health care providers are affected by this COVID -19 pandemic. We are here to help relieve some of the stress and burden these offices face by helping to co-manage non-emergency cases. If you, or someone you know is dealing with an acute or chronic issue such as low back pain, neck pain, headaches, or more, please reach out to our office. Let 's give our fellow health care providers the space they need to deal with this pandemic the best way they know how. And let us get you back on track the best way we know how. But How Does Going To The Chiropractor Help With My Immune System? While many may associate chiropractic treatment with those that are suffering from neck or back pain, know that there are more benefits than that! Chiropractic care aides in the overall health of patients and although adjustments of the spine help in relieving the pain of those suffering from back and neck discomfort, these adjustments also aide in our immune system. Our immune system is directly connected to our spine and when it is not aligned, it may throw your entire system offtrack. Thus, resulting in a non-responsive system. One of the main causes of immune system problems comes from subluxations (compression of nerve pathways). Chiropractors may use a variety of spinal manipulation to help relieve this compression and in turn may boost your immune system! Recommended Daily Doses During Cold/Flu Season: US KIMBERLEE BARNHART CH I ROPRACTIC CARE NEW PATIENTS COVID-19: What you should know PUBLISHED ON MARCH 13, 2020 The COVID-19 virus has presented the world with a health situation of heightened stress and concern, so I want to personally take a moment to share with you some facts regarding this coronavirus, suggest ways to easily help safeguard your family during this time, and hopefully ease your mind. Vi ruses have long-affected the human population (that's just part of life!) but the \"newness\" of th is particular virus in people, has created a great (albeit potentially over-exaggerated) fear of the unknown. Therefore, educating ourselves with reliable information is one of our greatest strengths in situations such as this. Here are the facts ... REVIEWS CONTACT US . -.. What is a coronavirus? Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. Many times these viruses are first spread to humans from wild animals. They commonly cause respiratory infections in people. Fortunately, our species has encountered (and thrived against) a multitude of other known coronaviruses. What is COVID-19? COVID-19 is the name of the current infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. How is a coronavirus spread? These viruses are spread by droplets from the mouth or nose in the form of mucous and saliva, exhalation, runny nose, coughing, and sneezing. What are the symptoms of the virus? The symptoms of the virus are very similar to other cold and flu strains, but could become more serious in immune compromised individuals. The most common symptoms of the virus include: fever, tiredness & dry cough. Other symptoms may include: body aches/pains, congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. How long does it take from contracting the virus to showing symptoms? The \"incubation period\" means the time between catching the virus and beginning to show symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. Meaning you can feel well and look well, but still be carrying (and spreading) illness, before you notice you are personally sick. However, this is very similar to other viruses and explains how illnesses seem to \"spread silently and quickly\" or \"cause sudden outbreaks.\" Although this is understandably scary, it is common in the cycle of infections. Should I wear a mask to protect myself? Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or are caring for someone ill with symptoms. Instead of wearing gloves, simply wash your hands. Please DO NOT unnecessarily purchase/overuse personal protective equipment that is essential for those who are actually ill and needed for healthcare providers who are in constant contact with sick individuals and require these supplies. Feeding into mass-hysteria and over buying essential healthcare items creates a supply shortage, is highly counterproductive and may be harmful for those in actual need of this equipment. Should I worry about COVID-19? Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults (as directly stated by the World Health Organization.) However, it can cause serious illness in the elderly or other immune compromised individuals (ie. those with cancer, lung conditions, heart conditions, and autoimmune diseases). What are we constantly doing to help safeguard you while visiting our office? Maintaining our cleanliness policies by regularly wiping down and disinfecting tables, surfaces, & equipment with medical-grade disinfectants throughout the day. Thoroughly washing hands. Providing you trustworthy, factual, and reliable information. We will continue to provide you up to date guidance as needed and welcome any questions or concerns you may have about COVID-19 or other health topics. Asking that any ill individual or caretaker of a sick person remain home and not come into the office. As with ANY infectious disease, our policy is that that you kindly remain home if you are unwell or closely caring for a sick family member, so as to avoid spreading illness unnecessarily to other patients and our Hartland staff. Particular[',{_ i[Y._ou (or an',{_one in 'LOUr household). is running_fever, coughing, or has a sore throat at this time, we ask that 'iOU maintain resQ.ect for our healinQ2Q.ace by_ NOT coming into the ofjj_ce until ',{_our ENTIRE household has been sv..mP-.tom-f1ee for at LEAST 7 da~! (Remember,y_ou can still car[Y.. and SQ.read illness for weeks even ifY..ou don't feel sick.). How can I protect myself and others, while preventing spread of the virus? While the spread of a new virus can be scary, humans have encountered countless viruses during our existence. A healthy level of caution is appropriate but panic is not productive. So let me instead encourage you to channel your concerns into actions to better protect yourselves, your loved ones and our community ... The best ways to prevent the spread of any virus is with good respiratory hygiene and thorough hand\u00ad washing. Since this virus is spread by contact with infected droplets the easiest and most effective ways to avoid infection are: r Regularly wash your hands with warm water and lots of soapy bubbles! (The mechanical process of scrubbing and rinsing hands is preferred over simply using a sanitizer gel.) I recommend singing the ABC's slowly while you wash so you more adequately clean. You may use an alcohol-based sanitizing gel as secondary, quick option if you cannot wash hands. Maintain polite respiratory hygiene! This is a simple habit our parents taught us as children. Ensure that you cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, your hand, or your bent below when coughing or sneezing. Then dispose of any tissues and wash your hands. If you are unwell, STAY HOME! Should you find yourself ill with COVID-19 symptoms (or any other flu/virus symptoms) use common sense & courtesy by avoiding contact with others and staying home. (Especially if running fever, coughing, or experiencing a sore throat.) However, if you are having difficulty breathing or experiencing more serious symptoms, call a medical professional in advance of an appointment and follow their directions for care. Maintain a 3-foot distance from sick individuals (especially those who are coughing and sneezing). Avoid touching your face, mouth, eyes, or nose after touching public surfaces so as to prevent bringing virus particles that may be on surfaces into contact with your own body. Wipe down commonly contacted surfaces of your home (such as doorknobs, toilets, sinks, kitchen table, refrigerator handles, phones etc) with antiVIRAL products once daily. (Anti-bacterial solutions are not effective against viruses.) Avoid crowds when unnecessary, but don't be afraid to get some fresh air, sunshine, and live your daily life! Avoid fueling undue hysteria and hygiene supply shortage by unnecessarily stockpiling everyday essentials such as soap, toilet paper, filtered water, hand sanitizer, gloves, and medical masks. These behaviors are counter-productive to greater community illness prevention. Other ways to naturally encourage a strong, adaptive, and healthy immune system are: GET ADJUSTED when you are well! Keep your immune and nervous systems strong and adaptable by maintaining monthly wellness adjustments. However, as with all other illnesses, we ask that you do not come to the office when you are sick or caring for sick individuals, and until symptoms have been absent from your entire household for at least one week. SLEEP! Being well rested with 6-8 hours of sleep each night is necessary for adequate immune function and bodily repair. Be consistent with your normal immune strengthening regimen. Maintain a diet low in processed foods, sugars, and excess carbs. Feed your body plenty of colorful vegetables, lean proteins, and hydrate with water throughout the day. Utilize vitamins and supplements to boost your immune strength such as: a daily multivitamin, daily probiotic (80% of your immune system lives in your health gut bacteria!), and Elderberry syrup/supplement (shown to have antiviral properties).

Additionally our frequent disinfection protocols and procedures have always been and will remain exceptional. Our large clinic facility allows patients to be adjusted without coming near (6 feet) of other patients. All Doctors will wash and disinfect hands in between patients (this is more effective than glove procedures). 3. Protect and confine your elderly loved ones (80+ yrs old) and minimize any public contact especially those with chronic illness such as: cardiovascular disease, lung disease, immune disease, and/or diabetes. 4. Practice excellent hygiene which involves frequent washing of hands for 60 seconds in hot water with lathering soapy disinfectant suds. 5. Hydrate with 2-3 liters of pure fresh water per day.

I am hoping, this cuts through the typical administrative emails you have been receiving. WEARE OPEN. We have actively been cleaning and disinfecting ALL surfaces from the parking lot all the way to our adjusting rooms. All door knobs, counter tops, tables, etc. We have always practiced wonderful hygiene practices but now we have doubled our efforts. Dr. Chad and Dr. Katie will be washing hands between EVERY patient and if unable, will be disinfecting hands with hand sanitizers. All tables, chairs and surfaces will constantly be wiped down after EVERY use. There is still much more YOU can do to protect yourselves during these times. Your immune system is you #1 defense against all bacterial and viral infections. Fortunately, we have ultimate control over the state of our immune systems and our families. Here are some of the best practices that we follow even in our own homes. GET PLENTY OF SLEEP. Often minimized as a source of immune response but studies have shown that deep sleep improves the immune system directly. Lower your lights 1 hour before bedtime, minimized backlit screens and cuddle with your loved ones till you are lulled into a drowsy state. Do not fight it. Let your natural physiology take over and drift off into a deep slumber. HYDRATION. The #1 deficient nutrient in most Americans is WATER. Staying hydrated is critical for EVERY biochemical process in your body including your immune system. The only side effect to proper hydration is that you will \"pee\" a lot. Inconvenient, I know. But a small price to pay. GET ADJUSTED. Regular chiropractic adjustments have been proven to boost your immune system (1). This is accomplished by improving the state of the nervous system which in turn improves the immune system. EAT WELL. Be sure to eat a healthy diet. Avoid sugars if at all possible and do not overeat. Try to \"graze\". In other words, eat smaller meals throughout the day instead of sitting and eating 3 meals and gorging. You all know what I'm talking about. This helps sustain a proper blood sugar level and prevents the moments of being \"famished\". We all know what happens when \"you're so hungry you can eat a cow\". HEALTHY SOCIALIZATION. Although the government is encouraging \"de-socialization\". I encourage you to reconnect with your nuclear family through conversation, family games and lots of hugs and cuddling. Family communication and physical touch have long been associated with decreased stress and improved overall health including the immune systems of the entire family . The chiropractic industry is communicating together as well and as one of my colleagues said, \"Let's practice PRUDENCE but not PANIC\". Taking the above precautions is PRUDENT. Wearing full body suits and showering with PURELL would be PANIC. Thank you all for the opportunity to serve you and your families.

Tags : buildimmune Category : Blog , coronavirus covid -19 Chiropractic Education , immune system Uncategorized Here are some tip how you and your family can build strong immune systems. Chiropractic adjustments Acupuncture Get more sleep Healthy diet with fruits and veggies Exercise Spinal adjustments have been shown to boost immune function because they serve to correct the spinal misalignment that cause neural dysfunction. Neural dysfunction stresses a body out, which may lead to a weakened immune system and lowered response to a foreign body, such as a virus. Getting a chiropractic adjustment is a great place to start so you can get any spinal misalignment you may have corrected. Even one adjustment can bring about an immediate immune boost. Acupuncture can regulate immune function and treat the underlying cause of the disease by reducing symptoms, speeding up the healing of infection and normalizing the body's immune response. Get more sleep! We are a nation of sleep-deprived individuals, but you don't have to be one of them. Sleep helps your body to reset and recharge, and keeps your system firing and protecting in the way that it should. Boost your immune system with a diet packed full of healthy fruits and vegetables. Cut back on sugar and processed foods. Add vitamins D from sunlight, C and Calcium from a high quality supplement. Dr. Collard uses the example if you throw beans on the sidewalk they won't grow.

The best teams in sports have both. And with the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to spread, that same rule applies to your health. By now we're all aware of the defensive strategies being mandated to mitigate the spread of this virus (closing of schools and businesses, cancellation of sporting events, social distancing, facemasks, etc.) The list goes on and on . All of these strategies are important, but exposure to the virus at some point is inevitable and a good offense will be crucial in remaining healthy . So what can you do to create a strong offense within your immune system? There are many things you can do but what is the single most effective option? Get Adjusted! Chiropractic's role in immunity has been recognized since the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic which claimed an estimated 20 million lives worldwide (500,000 in the U .S.). In the midst of the Spanish flu epidemic, the health care community discovered that the death rate of chiropractic patients was radically lower than that of non-chiropractic patients . In fact, it was this success in caring for Spanish flu victims that led to the professions licensure in many states . Researchers in Iowa found out that 1/15 victims died under medical care where as only 1/866 victims died under chiropractic care . These results are part of the proven, crucial link between the body's nervous system and the immune system . Chiropractic deals with the function of the nervous system which is the body's master controller. It controls and coordinates 100% of your body's functions, including immunity . If your nervous system's communication isn't in sync, immunity and other functions can diminish. Chiropractic adjustments address these communication errors and boost the immune system by allowing it to function optimally. In another study, the immune systems were measured of people under chiropractic care and compared to both those in the general population and those with cancer and other serious diseases. The chiropractic patients were found to have a 200% greater immune competence than those who had not received chiropractic care and a 400% greater immune competence when compared to those with cancer and other serious diseases. Through other research, it is found that the adjustment actually increases white blood cell counts giving individuals with adjusted spines an advantage in fighting off foreign viruses and bacteria that they are exposed to. CHIROP STUDY OF CAU~~ CO VID-19 and Chiropractic Care Nicki Thomas 0 April 21, 2020 COVID-19 has been called a once-in-a-century pandemic. Because the disease is so new, there is no cure or vaccinations against the Coronavirus. The CDC and National Institutes of Health have begun promoting the benefits of chiropractic care to the immune function during this global pandemic. Chiropractic is a health care discipline which emphasizes the inherent recuperative power of the body to heal itself without the use of drugs or surgery. The practice of chiro focuses on the relationship between structure (the spine) and function (as coordinated by the nervous system) and how that relationship affects the preservation and restoration of health . This Pandemic has resulted in changes to our everyday lives and has created increased levels of stress, anxiety, and fear . Scientific evidence has validated that long-term exposure to stress negatively effects the immune system. The immune system can distinguish between normal, healthy cells and unhealthy cells by recognizing a variety of \"danger\" cues. Infectious microbes such as viruses and bacteria release another set of signals recognized by the immune system. When the immune system first recognizes these signals, it responds to address the problem. If an immune system response cannot be activated when there is sufficient need, problems arise, like infection. (You can read the full article here).

As a precaution, we are doing all that we can to protect our patients and create an environment where you continue to feel safe and healthy. Here is an overview on the steps we are taking: CLEANING: While our office is cleaned readily, we have already increased efforts to sanitize and disinfect key, high-trafficked areas, including the tables, check-in computers, tools, kids areas, door knobs, handles, and the bathrooms. KIDS AREAS: Your children will notice a couple of differences when they come in. Our kid's area now only has a few easily cleanable toys. With that said, we understand that if you are sick or feeling ill, we encourage you to stay home. Though we know getting adjusted is one of best things you can do for cold/flu, the elevated circumstances prohibit travel and public exposure. For the rest of us, by getting adjusted regularly and removing nerve interference, it enhances and optimizes your immune system to have a better chance of fighting any virus/flu and heal itself faster. Below are some studies from the smart guys with pocket protectors and bow ties (hey wait I wear bow ties ,,_-;, ) about Chiropractic and the Immune system.

This strain/variant of it may be new but the corona virus is in the same family as SARS. 2. Corona can not thrive where Vitamin C lives. So give the kiddos vitamin C chews daily. Adults need 1000-2000 mg a day. Vitamin D3 is the firepower that fuels your immune system-consider S000IUs/ day for adults and 2000 I Us for children. (Please consult your physician if taking medications and we have all these available in office) 3. Elderberry daily helps as well. 4. Wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water vigorously (seriously wash your mitts) and don't touch your face. 5. Corona affects people with compromised immune systems the most. 6. Masks do not stop it! 7. We heal from the inside out and make sure you are eating healthy as possible with low or no sugar. One snickers bar drops your immune system around 75%. 8.

How to Keep Your Immune System Strong During the Coronavirus Pandemic COVID-19 Situation Report our immune system works as a well-organized team to protect you from infections. When it detects potentially dangerous bacteria or viruses, such as the Coronavirus (COVID-19), your immune system unleashes a powerful army to destroy what could potentially harm your body. 1 At least that's how things should work. Numerous things can impede your immune system, inhibiting its ability to fight the coronavirus and other threats. A weak immune system can't effectively fight bacteria, viruses, and toxins. 2 As a result, you become increasingly susceptible to infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) calls the coronavirus a pandemic, or a disease that is spreading in multiple countries around the world at the same time. 3 As of March 12, 4,751 people have died from the coronavirus. Around 10 percent of those with the coronavirus are in serious or critical condition. 4 On the other hand, of the closed cases about the coronavirus, 94 percent had recovered and were discharged. 5 Research shows that being overly obsessed with these kinds of statistics can create anxiety and stress, which can be damaging to your immune system. 6 Instead, be proactive and take simple precautions to protect your immune system. Wash your hands. You hear this often for a reason: You transfer germs through your eyes, nose, and mouth, which impacts your entire body. Washing hands with soap and clean, running water (for at least 20 seconds) can remove germs to help prevent many diseases and conditions. 7 YE.P. True Chiropractic Des Mines, IowaNumerous things can weaken your immune system and make you more susceptible to the coronavirus and other infections. Among them include: An overload of free radicals. Your body can handle a certain amount of these unstable molecules. But when free radicals overpower your body's antioxidant defense, a condition called oxidative stress can result. 8 Chronic inflammation. While inflammation is part of your body's immune response, that inflammation should do its job and simmer down. 9 When inflammation stays in overdrive -- called chronic inflammation -- your immune system can take a hit. 10 Being constantly stressed out. Some stress can actually keep your immune system strong. 11 But maintaining the right balance is key. Stress can include mental stress but also things like over-exercising. 13 They can all weaken your immune system. Environmental toxins. Cosmetics, food, water, and even the air you breathe can bombard your body with toxins, which accumulate and can hurt your immune system. 14 Don't smoke. If you drink alcohol, keep intake to one glass for women or two for men daily. Avoid contact with coworkers and other people as much as possible if you're feeling ill or sick. (Even the sniffles can be an early sign of a virus) Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a natural cleaning spray or wipe. Avoid crowded sources of transportation and events. Work closely with your healthcare practitioner.The good news is that with the right strategies, you can minimize your risk of the coronavirus to keep your immune system strong. Reduce Your Risk of Contracting COVID-19 Common sense creates a good foundation for a strong immune system to fight viruses such as the Coronavirus. Besides washing your hands and being mindful of your surroundings, other factors to consider for Coronavirus prevention and immune health include: Most importantly, don't panic. Constantly stressing or worrying can trigger illness and prolong its duration. Talk with your healthcare practitioner about any particular concerns about these and other things that can impact your immune system. Never discontinue or modify any medications or other advice without his or her consent.CellFree radicals attacking cellCell with oxidative stress9 Ways to Keep Your Immune System Strong During the Coronavirus Pandemic 1. Eat well. A strong immune system starts with what you put on the end of your fork. Eating plenty of antioxidant-rich vegetables and low-sugar fruits, for instance, can lower the number of free radicals to keep your immune system strong. 15 The omega-3 fatty acids in wild-caught seafood can help manage inflammation levels. 16 Our Core and Advanced Plans include these and other foods. Both plans provide all the nutrients you need to keep your immune system healthy. 2. Exercise. Moderate amounts of exercise can support your immune system.17 Strength training and higher- intensity exercise are great, but even walking counts. One study found that post-menopausal women who walked 30 minutes daily for a year had half the colds as those who didn't exercise. 18 3. Manage stress. Researchers looked at more than 300 human studies over three decades. They found that being constantly stressed can harm your immune system. 19 Keeping stress under control depends on what works for you: Meditation, deep breathing, regular exercise can all be helpful. 4. Stay hydrated. When you're dehydrated, you lower the volume of blood and lymphatic fluids that support a healthy immune system. Dehydration can also increase inflammation, 20 so your body can't work as efficiently to fight viruses and other infections. Drink plenty of clean, filtered water throughout your day. 5. Minimize environmental toxins. Buy organic foods whenever possible. Be mindful about cosmetics and other everyday products that can contain problem ingredients. The Environmental Working Group (EWG) has excellent guides on buying the best produce, skincare products, and household cleaners.Fortunately, you have plenty of control to keep your immune system strong and minimize infections. Prevention is key to avoid infections. How you eat and live can dramatically impact how well your immune system works. These nine strategies will keep your immune system healthy to prevent viruses and other infections. 6. Get good sleep. When you don't sleep well, you limit the ability of your immune cells to fight infections. Lack of sleep means you're more likely to get sick after you're exposed to a virus, plus your body takes longer to recover from illness. 21 Aim for eight hours of solid, uninterrupted sleep every night, and consider a sleep supplement if you have trouble falling or staying asleep. 7. Protect your gut. Your immune system and gut work together.22 After all, about 70 percent of your immune system is in your gut.23 An out- of-balance gut can weaken your immune system. Good gut health includes eating plenty of fermented and cultured foods, which contain probiotics to support your immune system. 24 8. Visit your chiropractor. Research shows that even a single chiropractic adjustment can positively benefit your immune system. 25 A three- year clinical study conducted by Ronald Pero, Ph.D., chief of cancer prevention research at New York's Preventive Medicine Institute, shows that those who receive chiropractic care have a 200% greater immune competence than those who do not. 26 Chiropractic care can provide other ways to keep your immune system strong including stress management tips and immune-supporting supplements. 9. Get the right nutrients. Being proactive about a strong immune system requires getting the right nutrients. MaxLiving Immune Boost Bundle is designed to help strengthen your immune system, so your body is better prepared to defend itself against viruses and illnesses. Daily Defense contains immune-supporting nutrients including curcumin and N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine. They work together to help lower inflammation and boost antioxidants. Probiotic 50B is a strong probiotic that stimulates healthy gut flora and effectively boosts immunity. This unique blend of ingredients is delivered in a moisture-resistant capsule featuring delayed release technology so your body will absorb it when it needs it the most. Vitamin C Complete combines this immune-supporting vitamin with the antioxidant boost of citrus bioflavonoids and quercetin to strengthen your immune system. Garlic + Parsley Oil Blend supports a healthy inflammatory response, a strong immune system, and antioxidant protection for your immune system. Vitamin D3 + Probiotics features 5,000 IU of vitamin D3, 10 CFU of probiotics, and FOS prebiotics from chicory root. This combination of ingredients delivers an immune-boosting punch to help fight off viruses. While global health concerns can feel nerve-wracking, you don't need to be a victim of panic. Be proactive and take common-sense approaches to your health. With these strategies, you have the power to support and maintain a strong immune system.

HIROPRACTIC acoma Chiropractic Blog> Chiropractic Treatment Boosts Immune System :\\\\ RSS Feed Chiropractic Treatment Boosts Immune System posted: Mar 17, 2020. Have you wondered how Chiropractic care can help your immune system? Especially in times of dire need? The above lecture was given by Dr. Daniel Murphy who is well known as a literary researcher, health care historian, and specializes in orthopedic and neurologic physiology. In summary, he discussed that in 1918, the year the Spanish (H1N1) Flu tragically stuck, independent healthcare observers noted that there was 40 times less mortality rate between patients who chose chiropractic care instead of the medical model. Similar to today's COVID-19 flu, in 1918, we didn't know what the Spanish Flu was or how to fix it medically. But we did discover that when a Chiropractor makes a specific adjustment, clearing spinal subluxations, it allows your nerve system to function freely, stimulating the immune system and improving its functionality. Conservative and supportive care to the human body is our best defense in this unknown time. Any person that has compromised health such as cardiac or pulmonary illness, diabetes or arthritis issues should of course follow the CDC's guidelines and self-quarantine. To further improve your immunity beyond an adjustment, one should maintain a well balanced diet, continue moderate exercise, sleep an hour longer in times of high stress and avoid anxiety laden situations, including constantly watching the news and social media. 9 10562 E . 96TH ST ., FISHERS, IN 46037 I J CALL 317 -588-0200 I B ADULT FORMS I B PEDIATRIC FORMS f @) E;2j ~ Home About Us Choose Chiropractic Connect \u00b7eoOKNOW ' as chiropractic covidl9 ATLAS CHIROPRACTIC: Statement on COVID-19 Due to the notice of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Indiana , we wanted to update you on procedures we are implementing to keep you and your family safe during this time .

The media has been reporting that children and people under 50 have nearly a 100% survival rate. One of the reasons is that their immune system is capable of dealing with the corona virus. It is interesting that people over people tend to have spinal degeneration and their nervous system and in turn their immune system is less capable of dealing with infection. Organs that have a strong relationship with the immune system, such as the lymph nodes and the spleen, communicate with your brain and nerves, and if your nervous system isn't functioning at an optimal level, a communication breakdown can occur. Getting a chiropractic adjustment is integral to keeping your body functioning optimally. Even one adjustment can bring about an immediate immune boost. A chiropractic adjustment isn't the only way to increase your immune function even though it is one of the most important ways to increase your immunity. The following methods should be used in conjunction with regular chiropractic care. First, get more sleep! Sleep helps your body to reset and recharge, those that do not get enough sleep tend to have a lower functioning immune system. Supplement with vitamin D and take vitamin C. (talk with your nutritionist of Chiropractor to see the amount of Dor C you need to take to help boost your immune system). Drink plenty of water. Sugar containing drinks paralyze your immune system, stay away from sugary drinks when you are trying to keep the flu or viruses away Most importantly going for regular adjustments even if you feel OK, you may find yourself fighting the corona virus and the flu better than before!

Those are all good habits to help protect yourself against COVID-19. However, there's another important step you can take. Get a chiropractic adjustment. After all, chiropractic does much more than relieve back and neck pain; it helps you stave off serious illnesses. How Does Chiropractic Help? Chiropractic care removes interferences to the body's capacity to resist illness and infection. \"The purpose of chiropractic care is to remove the interferences in the flow of energy that would shackle the nervous system's ability to carry energy to all parts of the body that control how well the body functions;' said Dr. Freedman. When the body has interference in energy flow , it doesn't perform as well. Since the immune system is one of the most critical functions of the body, the immune system is hindered in its ability to operate as well as it can. When that happens , the body is much more susceptible to illness . It becomes immune\u00ad compromised. All experts agree that when it comes to coronavirus, people who are most at risk are those who are immune-compromised. Add Chiropractic to Your Wellness Repertoire Here are things you should be doing to stay well: Eat a nutrient-dense diet Exercise Get proper rest Maintain a positive attitude Wash your hands for 20 seconds after being out in public Have regular chiropractic care Of course , getting chiropractic care is one of the most crucial things you can do. Regular chiropractic checkups help the body fight viruses and bacterial infection, including coronavirus . Enhancing Your Body's Ability to Heal Through regular chiropractic checks , you can improve your immune system and its response and strength.

The Centers for Disease Control has issued infection prevention habits to curb the spread of the virus around our communities. These recommendations include washing your hands with soap and warm water for 20 seconds or more and avoiding going out when you are feeling ill. These recommendations only scratch the surface of disease spread and prevention. Our body has a powerful ability to identify and manage foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria. The immune system is a complicated and elegant process that, when functioning correctly, can keep germs from multiplying and spreading and causing serious complications. We want to add to the CDC list of disease prevention habits with some additional recommendations for maintaining or improving our body 's natural, healthy immune response. Taking measures to maintain a healthy immune system not only prevents severe complications from viruses like COVID- 19 but also ensures that we are healthy and robust to take care of others who might not be able to fight off infections. STAY HYDRATED Water is essential for life ; it makes up the vast majority of our bodies. Without water , humans can survive only four (4) days. Becoming dehydrated not only impacts your physical functioning, but it also can have adverse effects on mood and mental functioning. Being fully hydrated helps your liver , kidneys, and gastrointestinal system function properly so that your body can flush out toxins and infections. To ensure you are staying adequately hydrated , make it a point to have 8-10 full glasses (8 oz) or more of water each day. EAT HEALTHY FOODS It's easy to slip into a comfort food habit when we are feeling stress or are locked up in our houses watching a neverending news cycle. Instead of reaching for those chips in the pantry , that candy hidden in the drawer, or ordering that pizza for delivery, focus on eating as many fruits and vegetables as you can into your daily meals. The more color and variety, the better for your immune system. The vegetables and fruits of our diets offer essential vitamins and minerals that support our body's immune function and immune response.

Reducing Back Pain by Increasing Flexibility GREENWOOD SERVICES PATIENT CENTER ABOUT BLOG CO NTACT US REDUCE STRESS There is no longer any question that our minds and our bodies are linked, and that stress (whether real or perceived) has a negative effect on health and immune function. We know it's easier said than done, but try not to \"worry\" about the spread of COVID-19. The act of worrying doesn't benefit you unless that \"worry\" instinct is quickly transformed into action to take care of yourself, your family, and your community. Studies have shown that a higher level of daily stress increases the risk of disease as much as smoking and poor diets. Don't be fooled that your ability to \"handle\" stress means you don't have stress. Just because you can stay productive in the face of stressful situations or feelings doesn't mean that the adverse effects of stress aren't felt by your body. Take measures now to reduce unnecessary stressors in your environment. If the news or the internet is raising your stress level, then it isn't doing you much good to \"stay in the know;' instead turn off the TV and put away your phones. If you have to check-in, then do so only at certain times of the day and only for a prescribed period (15 minutes). Find time for quiet and allow your mind and your body to relax. Take a nap or meditate for 15 minutes. These periods of stress reduction can work wonders for your immune system and for your ability to respond clearly and effectively to real stressors that show up in your daily life. MOVE AROUND , ELEVATE YOUR HEART RATE Your routines might change in the face of a viral outbreak such as COVI D-19, but don't let that disruption in routine impact your regular exercise routine. Moving around and elevating the heart rate will keep your circulation moving. A healthy circulation goes a long way towards responding to and eliminating infections and toxins from the body. GET ENOUGH SLEEP You may already notice that you catch colds more easily if you haven't been sleeping well. This should be your first hint that getting enough sleep has positive effects on your immune system. Not sleeping enough also increases stress hormones in the body, and we already know what stress can do to your immune system. Most people should shoot for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. To help your body get to sleep, reduce your exposure to blue lights from phones and computers for 1 hour before bedtime. Also, avoid eating within two hours of bedtime to prevent GI distress from interrupting your sleep. Lastly, try to keep your regular sleep habit even if other routines have flown out the window. Go to bed and wake up at generally the same time every day. SUPPLEMENTS There is some evidence that various micronutrient deficiencies - for example, deficiencies of zinc, selenium, iron, copper, folic acid, and vitamins A, 86, C, D3, and E - alter immune responses. So what can you do? If you suspect your diet is not providing you with all your micro nutrient needs it - for instance, you don't get enough fruits and vegetables - taking a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement may bring other health benefits, beyond any possibly beneficial effects on the immune system. Vitamin D3 is naturally depleted in people over the winter months due to lack of sun exposure on the skin. Vitamin D3 stimulates immune system function and increases resistance to viral and bacterial infections. We recommend a minimum dose of 2000iu's per day, but it is safe to take is doses as high as 20,000iu's per day. Vitamin D3 is a fat-soluble vitamin and should be taken with food. GET ADJUSTED Put simply, the better your body is functioning overall, the better your immune system can work to protect you. In addition to reducing pain and discomfort and improving the body's ability to move, chiropractic care and spinal manipulations specifically have been shown to enhance the immune activity, improve communication between the immune and nervous systems, and reduce pro\u00ad inflammatory cytokines. Taking action now to boost or support your immune system will not only help you to fight off infections like COVID-19 but will also help to improve overall health and wellbeing. Combining these immune-boosting practices and the CDC recommendations for infection control are your key to keeping your self, your family, and your community healthy.

If you are experiencing any of the following symptoms, FEVER COUGH ' SHORTNESS OF BREATH You should refrain from coming into the office, limit your exposure to other people, and reach out to your primary care physician/local emergency department to determine your risk level and next steps. It is estimated by epidemiologists that a large majority of those in the US could become exposed to the coronavirus. However, it is important to understand that it will not affect all individuals the same. For the majority of individuals, contracting the virus is expected to be similar to coming down with a cold or flu virus, followed by recovery. Symptoms for many will be mild to moderate. However, for individuals of advanced age, with complicating conditions or challenged immunities, it could cause more severe sickness or possible death. Measures taken by state and local officials have been based on emerging information as well as trends experienced in other areas that have already been exposed. In Ohio, the coronavirus is expected to peak in exposure and confirmed cases sometime in April. Cancellation of school and other events, and restrictions on gathering sizes, have all been done in an attempt to reduce the number of people that will become sick and to reduce the strain on the healthcare system so that resources are available to those who need it. In these unprecedented times of uncertainty, what can you do to improve your health and reduce the risk for you and your family? Here are some suggestions that we recommend: Drink plenty of water Eat healthy, nutrient rich foods Get plenty of rest/sleep Take daily vitamins, including those that are known to support your immune system Incorporate daily physical activity and stress reduction techniques like meditation into your routine.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your coughs and sneezes with your elbow or a tissue. Disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. Avoid close contact with others who are ill. If you can wait over two weeks for your next appointment, or are unsure if your condition warrants a physical appointment, feel free to email us at drummondchiropractic@gmail.com and let us know you would like a \"virtual appointment11 with one of our chiropractors. We will listen to your concerns, give you advice on what you can do at home for your health concerns until this 11stay\u00ad at-home\" is lifted, or we can let you know if your condition warrants a physical appointment with us. Here are some facts and resources we put together for you: If you are healthy, your immune system is very likely to combat this virus, like it does other pathogens. We encourage you to eat well, sleep well, destress and move well. Remember, the Corona Virus is not the only pathogen out there. Thousands of Americans die every year from the flu alone. So as always, it is best to follow guidelines from the CDC and Indiana State Department of Health. We have always and will continue to follow these guidelines at our clinic: It is inevitable we are going to be exposed to the virus at some point. The government is attempting to slow down the spread so our hospitals can handle the number of cases of those who succumb to the virus. Without slowing down the spread, it will spread so fast that the hospitals will be overwhelmed and more high risk people will be at risk of dying. We are doing our part by Scheduling so there are no more than 10 people in our clinic at one time. including our Drummond T earn (tons of space between people in our spacious office) Sanitize, sanitize and sanitize some more Keep everyone at least 6 feet apart while in common areas Since we are within 6 feet of our patients during the treatment, we are wearing masks during treatments We are asking patients to wait in their car until their appointment time, so we can take them straight back to the treatment room (minimizing the number of people in our common area) We are also scheduling patients their following appointment (if needed) while they are still in the treatment room with the doctor, so they can go straight out the door to their car right after treatment (again, to minimize the number of people in our clinic at all times) We have the capability to accept online payments, which has been helpful during this time of need to minimize patients in our waiting room. Did we mention sanitize, sanitize and sanitize some more :) But if you are a healthy person, it is ve[Y. likely_Y.OU will recover! Just like with any flu, you may be a carrier and not even feel sick, and if you do get sick, you are likely to get better . Experts in infectious disease epidemiology are reporting that at least 97% recover. That is over 97% odds in your favor!!! SO KEEP YOURSELF HEALTHY TO BETTER THESE ODDS!!! If you have traveled out of state (even just to a neighboring state, not just out of the country), have been in contact with someone testing positive with COVID-19, have a fever over 100 degrees, difficulty breathing or a dry cough, contact your medical doctor immediately to schedule for a COVID- 19 test. If you are sick, self quarantine for 14 days. There is no stopping this virus. It would be like trying to stop the wind. So here is our top three ways to help you stay well: Eat Well, Think Well, Move Well Eat well Eat real food not \"out of the box\" food with suspicious ingredients Avoid junk food, soda beverages and alcohol Drink plenty of water Half your weight in ounces of water Take your Vitamin C 1000 mg per day Ester-C is best (available at our office) Elderberry syrup is great for boosting the immune system Think well Sleep well Practice de-stressing avoid \"sensationalized news\" 2 hours before going to bed meditate breathe out twice as long as you breath in when feeling tense work on relaxing your muscles from your toes to the top of your head Move well Stretch often even if it is just rolling your shoulders back and down it does not have to be a fancy, but it is best to be done frequently Exercise go for a walk find a physical activity you enjoy doing laugh and find joy in life Get a chiropractic adjustment There is scientific evidence that getting an adjustment, especially if it results in a cavitation in the spine (a popping sound), that it increases the level of immune-globulins in the blood (boosts your immune system) To be clear, we are not claiming that getting an adjustment will make you immune to the virus An adjustment is another tool you can use to boost your immunity, just like taking a supplement, or washing your hands We just know that getting regular chiropractic adjustments helps boost your immune system and helps keep your body well Link to one of the studies: CLICK HERE Home I Services I New Patients I Meet The Doctors I About Us I Contact Us I Blog Call for Appointment Today: (317) 580-180 Boosting Your Immune Function To Protect Yourself From Disease & Infections March 13, 2020 / Dr. Kim Harper l No Comments \u00b7 Though it should be taken seriously, COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus is only one of a slew of viruses spreading around this winter in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control has issued infection prevention habits to curb the spread of the virus around our communities. These recommendations include washing your hands with soap and warm water for 20 seconds or more and avoiding going out when you are feeling ill. These recommendations only scratch the surface of disease spread and prevention. Our body has a powerful ability to identify and manage foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria. The immune system is a complicated and elegant process that, when functioning correctly, can keep germs from multiplying and spreading and causing serious complications. We want to add to the CDC list of disease prevention habits with some additional recommendations for maintaining or improving our body's natural, healthy immune response. Taking measures to maintain a healthy immune system not only prevents severe complications from viruses like COVID- 19 but also ensures that we are healthy and robust to take care of others who might not be able to fight off infections. Stay Hydrated Water is essential for life; it makes up the vast majority of our bodies. Without water, humans can survive only four (4) days. Becoming dehydrated not only impacts your physical functioning, but it also can have adverse effects on mood and mental functioning. Being fully hydrated helps your liver, kidneys, and gastrointestinal system function properly so that your body can flush out toxins and infections. To ensure you are staying adequately hydrated, make it a point to have 8-10 full glasses (8 oz) or more of water each day. Eat Healthy Foods It's easy to slip into a comfort food habit when we are feeling stress or are locked up in our houses watching a neverending news cycle. Instead of reaching for those chips in the pantry, that candy hidden in the drawer, or ordering that pizza for delivery, focus on eating as many fruits and vegetables as you can into your daily meals. The more color and variety, the better for your immune system. The vegetables and fruits of our diets offer essential vitamins and minerals that support our body's immune function and immune response.

We know it's easier said than done, but try not to \"worry\" about the spread of COVID-19. The act of worrying doesn't benefit you unless that \"worry\" instinct is quickly transformed into action to take care of yourself, your family, and your community. Studies have shown that a higher level of daily stress increases the risk of disease as much as smoking and poor diets. Don't be fooled that your ability to \"handle\" stress means you don't have stress. Just because you can stay productive in the face of stressful situations or feelings doesn't mean that the adverse effects of stress aren't felt by your body. Take measures now to reduce unnecessary stressors in your environment. If the news or the internet is raising your stress level, then it isn't doing you much good to \"stay in the know;' instead turn off the TV and put away your phones. If you have to check-in, then do so only at certain times of the day and only for a prescribed period (15 minutes). Find time for quiet and allow your mind and your body to relax. Take a nap or meditate for 15 minutes. These periods of stress reduction can work wonders for your immune system and for your ability to respond clearly and effectively to real stressors that show up in your daily life. Move Around, Elevate Your Heart Rate Your routines might change in the face of a viral outbreak such as COVID-19, but don't let that disruption in routine impact your regular exercise routine. Moving around and elevating the heart rate will keep your circulation moving. A healthy circulation goes a long way towards responding to and eliminating infections and toxins from the body. Get Enough Sleep You may already notice that you catch colds more easily if you haven't been sleeping well. This should be your first hint that getting enough sleep has positive effects on your immune system. Not sleeping enough also increases stress hormones in the body, and we already know what stress can do to your immune system. Most people should shoot for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. To help your body get to sleep, reduce your exposure to blue lights from phones and computers for 1 hour before bedtime. Also, avoid eating within two hours of bedtime to prevent GI distress from interrupting your sleep. Lastly, try to keep your regular sleep habits even if other routines have flown out the window. Go to bed and wake up at generally the same time every day. Supplements There is some evidence that various micronutrient deficiencies - for example, deficiencies of zinc, selenium, iron, copper, folic acid, and vitamins A, B6, C, and E - alter immune responses. So what can you do? If you suspect your diet is not providing you with all your micronutrient needs\u00ad for instance, you don't get enough fruits and vegetables - taking a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement may bring other health benefits, beyond any possibly beneficial effects on the immune system. Get Adjusted Put simply, the better your body is functioning overall, the better your immune system can work to protect you. In addition to reducing pain and discomfort and improving the body's ability to move, chiropractic care and spinal manipulations specifically have been shown to enhance the immune activity, improve communication between the immune and nervous systems, and reduce pro\u00ad inflammatory cytokines. Taking action now to boost or support your immune system will not only help you to fight off infections like COVID-19 but will also help to improve overall health and wellbeing. Combining these immune-boosting practices and the CDC recommendations for infection control are your key to keeping your self, your family, and your community healthy. @) COVID-19: Yes, We're Open!

As long as we feel we can serve our patients safely and maintain the safety of our employees (or directed otherwise by government authorities) we are dedicated to staying open and servicing our patients. We are separating our patients and each patient will have their own room along with extra sanitizing of all areas of the clinic and limiting the amount of people allowed in the clinic. During this time, there are ways to boost the immune system to prevent or ward off illness. While it is important to follow a healthy diet with a mix of fruits and vegetables, chiropractic care can aid in boosting immunity. If the body is in pain, the nervous system is preoccupied with the discomfort instead of keeping sickness at bay. Our health and immunity are reliant on the alignment of the spine. With a simple adjustment, the nervous system is relaxed enough to coordinate with the immune system. The best way to have optimal health is to have a balance between the nervous and immune functions of the body. Ultimately, patients could see a substantial improvement in immune competence with regular chiropractic assistance! Additionally, minimizing stress, getting extra sleep, and sticking to a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise can maximize a patient's overall immunity to the illnesses around us. Trying something like yoga, meditation, or even reading could benefit overall health. Our new Biosound technology can help to also reduce stress and build immunity by calming the brain and bringing you into a peaceful state. Consuming water with a slice of lemon could also aid in a building a barrier between the viruses and our fragile immunity.

The sensational reports tend to focus on tragedies and the ultimate real ity that sicknesses can be deadly. Other positive realities and facts exist as well. The coronavirus is a common virus that causes an infection in the nose, sinuses, or upper throat. Most coronaviruses do not accompany the deadly outcomes catching media headlines. People infected with the coronav irus report co ughs, fever, and respiratory iss ues. Some extreme cases invo lve pneumon ia. Antibiotics do not work against this viral attack on the immune system. Recovery pr imarily involves the strength of the immune system. The best weapon for the coronavirus and the flu begins with building a strong, proactive immune system. One drop of blood contains five million red blood cells, seven thousand white b lood cells, and thousands of platelets. These cells work feverishly to heal and defend the body against foreig n invaders. The most amazing eleme nt of the process comes from the fact that the body adapts and responds naturally and without a conscious decision to do so. The entire process of adaptation and response operates under the direction of the central nervous system. Scientists discovered the unique connection between the central nervous sys tem and the immune system and continue to compile research and evidence about the process . Chiropractic plays a key role because of the spine's relationsh ip with immunity. Research sho ws that when the spine remains immob ile of misaligned, the body operates in a heightened state of stress equivalent to be ing in battle. Operating in a heightened state of stress weakens rest, immunity, and growth within the nervous system. Gent le Chiropractic adjustments improve immunity by allowing the nervous system to function at maximum capacity for healing and repair. Chiropract ic adjustments increase movement and improve alig nment while reducing stress. Evidence shows that people who receive regular adjustments report stronger immunity after beginning Chiropractic care. Research from 2010 determined that patients who received Chiropractic adjustments showed increased levels of a specific signaling molecu le in the body called lnterleukin-2. lnterleukin-2 regulates the act ivities of white b lood cells which are responsib le for immunity. The molecule impacts the body's natural response to microbial infection and helps the body recognize and create specific responses that neutralize foreign invaders. This protein molecule was found to be higher in those who received Chiropractic spinal adjustments when compared to those who did not. The primary focus of a Ch iropractic ad justment does not center on treat ing a specific symptom or condition. The increased health and function from an adjustment represen ts an outcome which originates when interference is removed from the nervous system. While other professions focus on changing the environment to s uit a weakened body, Chiropractic pursues strengthening the body to suit the environment. Four Keys to Improving Immunity: 1) Stay on track w ith adjustments to keep the autonomic nervous system in balance. 2) Consume adequate amounts of V itamin D, a major immune booster. 3) Add 30-60 minutes of extra sleep to the daily routine. Inadequate sleep depletes immunity. 4) Drink water and remove s ugary drinks and snacks from the diet. Sugar drains imm unity. 5) Move the body. Exercise increases lymphatic flow and provides significant immune benefits.

Everyone is under extraordinary levels of stress. Chiropractic Services represent an essential and necessary component of the health care program of millions of patients of all ages and all walks of life in the United States and worldwide. Timely and consistent access to chiropractic care is essential to the maintenance of the hea lth and wellbeing of this patient population , particularly during times of stress. The association encourages jurisdictions at a ll levels to acknowledge and respect that chiropractic is an essential healthcare service even during a pandemic. It is important to recognize that as of mid-March 2020, there are no recognized cures in conventional medicine or alternative health approaches for COVID-19. There are no vaccines, no drugs , no natural remedies, no alternative therapies that have been tested and the outcomes peer reviewed to meet any evidence-based standard. The public ha s the right to seek their own pathway to health and well-being. For millions of Americans, that pathway include s regular chiropractic care. For individuals such as those recovering from injury or suffering back pain, chiropractic care is essential on their road to recovery. ICA President , Stephen P. Welsh , DC, FICA stated , \"While Coronavirus-19 has everyone's attention, it cannot be forgotten that health promotion and non-opioid pain management through chiropractic adjustments of the subluxation is essential and should not be curtailed or restricted because of this pandemic . With churches, schools, restaurants, museums being closed, the ICA remind s authorities that the offices of doctors of chiropractic shou ld be treated no differently than the offices of medical doctors - as an essential health care service.\" CHIROPRACTIC .. /P~&S~ Chiropractic, Plain & 34232 Phone: {941) 331-4334 Partnering With You Amid COVID-19 In the light of so many of our patients calling to get checked to keep their immune systems strong during this time, our office will remain open to help as many as we can .

Plain & Simple As the coronavirus spreads, we are hearing about how to reduce exposure and take care of ourselves if we get sick. These are important tips , but we're not hearing much about how we can boost our immunity so that if we do get exposed to the virus , our body can effectively fight back. And right now, without vaccines or cures, prevention is our one effective ally. We want to help in reminding you that regular Chiropractic adjustments help to both reduce stress levels and keep your immune system strong. With coronavirus continuing to spread, it's more important than ever to support the immune system with regular chiropractic care. Thank you for trusting us to be an integral part of your prevention team! Chiropractic Care and Pandemics of the Past How does Chiropractic Care benefit the Immune System ? Coronavirus Prevention Team When most people think of chiropractic care their first thought is back pain and spinal adjustments; however , there are a number of additional benefits to chiropractic care, including benefits to the immune system. -All American Healthcare The Flu Epidemic of 1917-18 Chiropractic care was first linked to the immune system during the deadly flu epidemic in the early 1900 's. The data reported that flu victims under chiropractic care had an estimated .25 percent death rate, a lot less than the normal rate of 5 percent among flu victims who did not receive chiropractic care . -Psychology Today In Davenport , Iowa, 50 medical doctors cared fo r 4,953 cases with 274 deaths while 150 chiropractors saw 1,635 cases with one death. Outside of Davenport, medical doctors in the state treated 93,590 patients with 6,116 deaths. That's one death out of every 15 patients. 4,735 patients were seen by chiropractors and only six patients died . That's one out of every 789. In the same epidemic, New York health authorities (who kept records of flu as a reportable disease) showed that under chiropractic care , only 25 patients died of influenza out of every 10 ,000 cases; and only 100 patients died of pneumonia out of every 10 ,000 cases . Yes, the medical profession was seeing a majority of the worst of the worst ; however, one of the greatest statistics backing chiropractic care comes from the state of Oklahoma . There were 233 cases in which the medical docto rs had cared fo r patients and eventually pronounced them as \"lost\" or beyond hope ... chiropractors took care of all 233 with onl y 25 deaths . -Healthfultips How Chiropractic Boosts Immunity There is a clear connection as to why chiropractic care can improve the function of the nervous system and body functions, but research is consistently working to show a clear connection between chiropractic care and the immune system. How the Nervous and Immune Systems Work Together The nervous system and immune system are hardwired to work together to create optimal responses for the body and interact with each other more often than you may think . Both systems release hormone s and tiny messenger molecules that can communicate with each other and other organs in the body. The nervous system relays information to the brain from the entire body and can directly influence receptors in the immune system. The brain has the ability to use nerve cells to communicate directly with the immune system and trigger an immune response, and vice versa . The immune system can send signals to the brain to let it know of any foreign , unwanted antigens . The brain can then tell the nervous system to react. Some studies show increased levels of antibodies and other essential cells in the immune system following an adjustment. In some cases, patients who were sick with colds, sore throats, and sinus congestion reported accelerated recoveries after their adjustments . Summary The goal of chiropractic care is to remove an y interference in the nervous system that may prevent you from natural day to day functions. This is because the nervous system controls the functions of your entire body . Adjustments on a specific inflamed area of the body reduces stress on the nervous system , allowing it to better communicate with the rest of the body. The better your nervous s ystem can function and communicate, the better the rest of your body can function and communicate.

Chiropractic, Your Immune System, and Deadly Infections :\\\\ RSS Feed The coronavirus of 2020 . COVID-19 , has triggered the greatest health scare in recent m emory. Americans are undergoing levels of anxiety and sometimes panic not seen since the 911 attacks. th e JFK Assassination . and even the Cuban Missile Crisis . Our Nation is activating crisis manag ement and mobilizing social and regulatory forces not applied since World War II. Many people compare COVID-19 to the Spanish Flu Epidemic in 1918. Estimates of the worldwid e death toll from 1918 Spanish Flu range from 20 million up to 100 million . which would mak e it the great est pandemic of record ed history. While much of the Spanish Flu pandemic remains shroud ed in historical mystery . one of the more remarkable aspects about it is that it killed so many young adults . This population group would normally be expected to have greater strength and vitality and th erefore greater resistanc e to infection than older or younger people . Another little known fact from the 1918 pandemic is that there were patients who survived in much higher numbers because they received chiropractic care. Ii) Historical records show: In Davenport, Iowa, medical doctors treated 93,590 flu patients with 6,116 deaths -a death rate of 6.53%. At the Palmer School of Chiropractic (in Davenport), Chiropractors adjusted 1,635 flu patients, with only one fatality -a death rate of 0.06%. Outside Davenport, chiropractors in Iowa cared for 4,735 flu patients with only six deaths -a death rate of 0.13%. During the same epidemic, in Oklahoma, out of 3,490 flu patients under chiropractic care, there were only seven fatalities - a death rate of 0.2%. Furthermore, 233 flu patients that medical doctors had given up as hopeless finally received chiropractic care. All but 25 of these 233 dying flu patients were saved from death by chiropractic, an 89% success rate rescuing these terminal patients. While data collection back then was not what we have today, these figures clearly indicate that chiroP-ractic care P-rovided benefits for these terribly sick P-eOP-le that raised their chances of survival by_y_P-to 100-fold. Modern research provides clear evidence that chiropractic has a positive influence on the nervous system and improved immune function. In 1974 in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association the physiologist and researcher I. M. Korr stated that \"spinal lesions\" (comparable to a \"spinal vertebra out of place\") are associated with disturbed activity of the sympathetic nervous system. According to Korr, \"High sympathetic (nervous system) tone may alter organ and tissue responses to hormones, infectious agents, and blood components.\"liil Doctors of Chiropractic daily correct spinal lesions and boost the nerve and immune systems so that you are healthier. In 1987 a study published in Immunology Review concluded that \"Many stimuli, which primarily act on the central nervous system, can profoundly alter immune responses. \"liiil The spinal adjustment by your Chiropractor supplies just such stimulation to the nervous system . In 1992 a study published in the professionaljournal Circulation concluded \"'Growing evidence suggests that immune function is regulated in part by the sympathetic nervous system.\" The researchers found \"'there was a sharp rise in T suppressor/cytotoxic cells and natural killer cells following sympathetic (nervous system) stimulation.\"[iv] Again, stimulation via the chiropractic adjustment can enhance nerve and immune function and therefore health. Another peer-reviewed research study published in 1992 in the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics found that when a thoracic \"manipulation\" was applied to the spine, the response of immune cells isolated from blood collected 15 minutes after the manipulation was significantly higher than blood collected 15 minutes before and 30 and 45 minutes after manipulation.[v] In 1994 a controlled study of HIV positive patients was conducted and the results published in Chiropractic Research Journal. This research studied the effects of specific chiropractic adjustments on the immune system CD4 cell counts of HIV positive individuals. Half the patients received specific spinal adjustments and the control group received a placebo. Over the six month period of the study: the control group experienced a z.96% decrease in CDA immune cell counts the adjusted group experienced a 48% increase in CDA immune cell counts.lvil In 2000 a peer-reviewed report in the professionaljournal Pharmacological Review stated the following: \"The brain and immune system are the two major adaptive systems in the body. During an immune response, the brain and the immune system 'talk to each other' and this process is essential for maintaining homeostasis .. . Two pathways link the brain and the immune system: the autonomic nervous system (ANS) via direct neural influences, and the neuroendocrine humeral outflow via the pituitary .... the ANS regulates the function of all innervated tissues and organs throughout the vertebrate body with the exception of skeletal muscle fibers.\"[vii] I am not saying that Chiropractic will cure COVID-19 or any other infection. I am stating that Chiropractic has been shown to enhance nervous system and immune function. Your immune system is fighting off infections every day of your life. I am also stating with great confidence: The better your spine, the better your nervous system.The better your nervous system, the better your immune system.The better your immune system, the better you are able to fight off any infection.With Chiropractic care you will have a better spine, a better nervous system, and a better immune system for your best experience of health, strength, and vitality. We are being told that we face the greatest epidemic in 100 years. If we want to better protect ourselves and our families, doesn't it make sense to get chiropractic care? 6'.

In these historic, unprecedented, and concerning times, it is important to remain calm and develop a game plan. Huddle up with your family, friends, congregation, and support groups to discuss a plan of action. This is especially important if you have special needs or are in a high-risk group. The facts are that this flu-like infection can be very contagious. If you have ever had the flu you know that it hits suddenly, and you become very sick very quickly. The coronavirus symptoms are fever greater than 103\u00b0, generalized muscle/joint aches, and a significant cough with possible shortness of breath. If you get these sudden symptoms, I recommend that you get tested quickly and follow your medical doctor's instructions. This virus can be more dangerous than typical influenza -especially for older people and people who may be on medications that compromise their immune system. If you have pre-existing conditions such as asthma, COPD, diabetes, heart disease or lung issues, take extra precautions to avoid getting ill. I think by now we all know what those precautions are. To try and stay healthy continue to do some form of stretching or exercising, take nutritional supplements such as vitamin D, timed-release vitamin C, zinc, and extra zinc lozenges if you feel sick. Stay hydrated and get plenty of rest. Self-isolate if you feel sick. At our clinic, we are taking extra measures to keep our treatment tables and equipment sanitized. Our staff is here to keep those who are not directly affected by this virus on their care plans. Research has shown that regular chiropractic adjustments can have a positive effect on our immune system and keep our nervous system strong. If you develop influenza or coronavirus symptoms please notify us. We can postpone your treatment until you recover and then resume care at that time. From all of us at Waldrop Chiropractic and Wellness, we will get through this pandemic together. The next few weeks may be difficult and scary. But in the end, we will look back at this and appreciate how hard our immune system and chiropractic care can work for us. We have your back! Dr. Rachel Waldrop, D.C. Our Thoughts on COVI D-19 As always, the well-being of you and your family is our highest priority at Waldrop Chiropractic and Wellness. We continue to follow and apply health and safety regulations, regardless of season or sickness. This is how we ensure that our practice members can trust us, not only for chiropractic care, but for the office environment. We wanted to detail some of our sanitation and cleaning measures for you, as we all try to make wise, positive choices. What We Are Doing These include our normal protocols. We are adding extra thought to keeping everyone as healthy as possible. We are giving specific, scientific adjustments so each nervous system functions optimally to boost immunity against all germs and viruses. The office is being thoroughly and regularly sanitized. We use hand sanitizer or wash our hands between each adjustment. We pull we wipe down our tables and use new paper for each patient. If you do not want to use the keypad, just ask the front desk to sign you in. We wipe down the check-in stations between each patient. We are working to be more efficient, avoiding crowding in the office. Immune SY-stem Booster Facts White blood cells counts are higher within 15 minutes after a chiropractic adjustment, as shown in this study. Chiropractic boosts your immune system as much as 200%. (\"Pero R.\" \"Medical Researcher Excited by CBSRF Project Results.\" The Chiropractic Journal, August 1989; 32.) Just over 100 years ago, there was another pandemic: The Spanish Flu of 1918-1919. Invaluable statistics came to light in that difficult time about the value of chiropractic care and fully functioning nervous systems. Recommendations Continue to get adjusted, so your brain and body can communicate without interferences. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based sanitizer. Keep away from others who are sick. Avoid touching handrails, door handles and other high traffic surfaces in public places. Avoid touching your face, nose, eyes, etc. Avoid non-essential travel. If you aren't feeling well (even if it's mild), stay home, rest and hydrate. Maintain your current nutritional and exercise schedule are prescribed or recommended by this office. According to the CDC, if you think you have been exposed to COVI D-19 and develop a fever and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or difficulty breathing, call your healthcare provider immediately. Your healthcare professional will work with your state's public health department and the CDC to determine if you need to be tested for COVID-19. If you are feeling unwell, we ask that you please take steps to safeguard others and remain at home. We care about each of you so deeply and want you to know we are here for you.

For Physicians Patient Center About Contact BOOKAPPOIN Boosting Your Immune Function To Protect Yourself From Disease & Infections by Dr. Daniel Roig I Mar 12, 2020 I Health Alerts I 0 comments Though it should be taken seriously, COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus is only one of a slew of viruses spreading around this winter in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control has issued infection prevention habits to curb the spread of the virus around our communities. These recommendations include washing your hands with soap and warm water for 20 seconds or more and avoiding going out when you are feeling ill. These recommendations only scratch the surface of disease spread and prevention. Our body has a powerful ability to identify and manage foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria. The immune system is a complicated and elegant process that, when functioning correctly, can keep germs from multiplying and spreading and causing serious complications. We want to add to the CDC list of disease prevention habits with some additional recommendations for maintaining or improving our body's natural, healthy immune response. Taking measures to maintain a healthy immune system not only prevents severe complications from viruses like COVID-19 but also ensures that we are healthy and robust to take care of others who might not be able to fight off infections. Stay Hydrated Water is essential for life; it makes up the vast majority of our bodies. Without water, humans can survive only four (4) days. Becoming dehydrated not only impacts your physical functioning, but it also can have adverse effects on mood and mental functioning. Being fully hydrated helps your liver, kidneys, and gastrointestinal system function properly so that your body can flush out toxins and infections. To ensure you are staying adequately hydrated, make it a point to have 8-10 full glasses (8 oz) or more of water each day. Eat Healthy Foods It's easy to slip into a comfort food habit when we are feel ing stress or are locked up in our houses watching a neverending news cycle. Instead of reaching for those chips in the pantry, that candy hidden in the drawer, or ordering that pizza for delivery, focus on eating as many fruits and vegetables as you can into your daily meals. The more color and variety, the better for your immune system. The vegetables and fruits of our diets offer essential vitamins and minerals that support our body's immune function and immune response. Free Guide Start Eliminating Yo Back Pain Today!

We know it's easier said than done, but try not to \"worry\" about the spread of COVID-19. The act of worrying doesn't benefit you unless that \"worry\" instinct is quickly transformed into action to take care of yourself, your family, and your community. Studies have shown that a higher level of daily stress increases the risk of disease as much as smoking and poor diets. Don't be fooled that your ability to \"handle\" stress means you don't have stress. Just because you can stay productive in the face of stressful situations or feelings doesn't mean that the adverse effects of stress aren't felt by your body. Take measures now to reduce unnecessary stressors in your environment. If the news or the internet is raising your stress level, then it isn't doing you much good to \"stay in the know,\" instead turn off the TV and put away your phones. If you have to check-in, then do so only at certain times of the day and only for a prescribed period (15 minutes). Find time for quiet and allow your mind and your body to relax. Take a nap or meditate for 15 minutes. These periods of stress reduction can work wonders for your immune system and for your ability to respond clearly and effectively to real stressors that show up in your daily life. Move Around, Elevate Your Heart Rate Your routines might change in the face of a viral outbreak such as COVID-19, but don't let that disruption in routine impact your regular exercise routine. Moving around and elevating the heart rate will keep your circulation moving. A healthy circulation goes a long way towards responding to and eliminating infections and toxins from the body. Get Enough Sleep You may already notice that you catch colds more easily if you haven't been sleeping well. This should be your first hint that getting enough sleep has positive effects on your immune system. Not sleeping enough also increases stress hormones in the body, and we already know what stress can do to your immune system. Most people should shoot for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. To help your body get to sleep, reduce your exposure to blue lights from phones and computers for 1 hour before bedtime. Also, avoid eating within two hours of bedtime to prevent GI distress from interrupting your sleep. Lastly, try to keep your regular sleep habits even if other routines have flown out the window. Go to bed and wake up at generally the same time every day. Supplements There is some evidence that various micronutrient deficiencies - for example, deficiencies of zinc, selenium, iron, copper, folic acid, and vitamins A, B6, C, and E - alter immune responses. So what can you do? If you suspect your diet is not providing you with all your micronutrient needs it-for instance, you don't get enough fruits and vegetables - taking a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement may bring other health benefits, beyond any possibly beneficial effects on the immune system. Get Adjusted Put simply, the better your body is functioning overall, the better your immune system can work to protect you. In addition to reducing pain and discomfort and improving the body's ability to move, chiropractic care and spinal manipulations specifically have been shown to enhance the immune activity, improve communication between the immune and nervous systems, and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines. Taking action now to boost or support your immune system will not only help you to fight off infections like COVID-19 but will also help to improve overall health and wellbeing. Combining these immune-boosting practices and the CDC recommendations for infection control are your key to keeping your self, your family, and your community healthy.

It is estimated by epidem iologists that a large majority of those in the US could become exposed to the coronavirus. However, it is important to understand tha t it will nor affec t all individuals the same. For the majority of individuals, contrac ting the virus is expec ted to be s imilar to coming down with a co ld or flu virus, followed by recovery. Symptoms for many will be m ild to moderate. However, for individuals of advanced age, with comp licating conditions or challenged immunities, it cou ld cause more severe sickness or possib le death. Measures taken by s tate and loca l officials have been based on emerging information as we ll as trends experienced in other areas that have already been exposed. In Ohio, the coronavirus is expected to peak in exposure and confirmed cases sometime in Apri l. Cancellation of school and other events, and restrictions on ga thering sizes, have all been done in an attempt to reduce the number of people that will become sick and reduce the strain on the healthcare SY.Stem so that resources a re available to those who need it.

Get adjusted G Ca (330: Dear Premier Patients, Friends, and Community: During the unsettling event of the Corona Virus pandemic, we are maintaining normal office hours and services for our patients and community! While we are all holding our breath and lying low, waiting to see what will happen--life goes on! If we are trying to recover from an automobile accident or industrial injury, our healing processes don't go on hold until quarantines are lifted. If we don't actively work on optimal recovery, we will be stuck with less than optimal outcomes. Additionally, one of the very best ways to stimulate your immune system is chiropractic adjustment of the spine. Research clearly demonstrates increased white blood cell circulation for several days following getting adjusted. And no health care providers are better trained in alternative treatment and therapies to stimulate and maintain the immune system than chiropractic. At Premier Chiropractic and Sports Medicine we are carefully following CDC healthcare provider protocols for limiting disease communication and spread with the following policies and practices: All staff members are routinely treating our hands with surgical scrub (Hibiclens) to kill bacteria and viruses that may contact our hands; All common surfaces, door knobs, I-pads, ink pens and treatment tables are being cleaned regularly; Reception area seating has been spread to maintain recommended 6' distances from other parties; All patients are being screened by phone prior to arriving at the clinic for any symptoms of COVID-19; All patients are treated upon arrival with the FDA Approved Violet laser which kills all bacteria and viruses--FREE! What can you do to help keep yourself virus-free and not spread COVID-19? Wash your hand with soap on an hourly basis; Clean solid surfaces, keyboard and doorknobs regularly; If you are sick, stay home from work; If someone at work is sick, they leave or you leave! Get good sleep, hydration (3-4 liters water/day), exercise in private; Get adjusted! Adjusting stimulates the immune system to fight off infection! If you have any concern about COVID-19--Call us! Stay tuned for daily updates on anti-viral nutrition, natural virus cures, and maybe a bad joke or two! Doc. Brian E. Larson, D.C., DACBSP\u00ae Clinical Director and Wellness, Chiropractic As coronavirus (COVID-19) is at the top of the headlines, stay informed from trusted information sources such as the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Below are reasonable steps you can take to help keep yourself healthy and safe. Boost your immune system! First and foremost, I urge all of you to do everything possible to stay healthy yourself It's essential to prioritize your well-being and do all you can to boost your immune system. Research shows that sustaining healthy habits supports immunity and can help prepare our bodies to better fight and recover from illnesses. Stick to a nutrient-dense, toxin-free diet, including known immune-supportive foods like garlic and ginger. Avoid foods that tend to weaken the immune system, such as sugar, refined grains, and all processed and refined foods, as much as you can. Keep alcohol consumption to a minimum. Continue receiving adjustments, they increases the activity of the body's white blood cells that work to combat viruses. Practice mindfulness. Research suggests that mindful meditation can have benefits for health including immune function. Get adequate sleep, ideally seven to eight hours a night. This is your body's time to perform preventive maintenance, which bolsters the immune system. Research shows that repeatedly short-changing sleep by even an hour or two can negatively affect immunity. Get plenty of sunshine and supplemental Vitamin D and K2. High levels of vitamin D have long been linked to lower rates of illness. Consider taking additional vitamins, micronutrients, and supplements to support immunity, such as a high-quality multivitamin, magnesium, omega-3, vitamin C, elderberry, and digestive enzymes. Probiotics and powdered greens have also been shown to support immune and gut health. Get at least 20 minutes of low- to moderate-intensity exercise a day to prime the immune system . This movement results in the production of more white blood cells, which combat bacteria and viruses, and promotes improved circulation. VIRTUAL CHECK-IN FOR YOUR SAFTEY!!

Below is an update of what we are doing internally and what you can be doing to keep your immune system strong. We are following all current CDC guidelines regarding COVID-19. Our office is staying up to date on all updates coming from the CDC and we are making every effort to provide safe and effective care for our community. First: BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM You should be focusing on boosting your immune system. At home you can eat less refined white sugar, less processed food and more healthy whole foods, drink more water and get as much sunlight as you can in Colorado. As far as Chiropractic, now more than ever, you should be getting ADJUSTED! Typically, patients on a maintenance schedule will be able to hold their chiropractic adjustments from 1-3 weeks, depending on stress levels. However, in times of immune system suppression, a patient can have their spine examined for misalignments several times per week to ensure their nervous system is free of interference. White blood cells, which eat and destroy bad cells, are enhanced through chiropractic care. 1 DDScience has shown that getting adjusted boosts the immune system!DD ~~The chief of cancer prevention at New York's Preventative Medicine Institute found that people who received regular chiropractic care over a five-year period had a 200% greater immune competence than those who had not received chiropractic care. The chiropractic group showed a 400% greater immune competence than people with cancer and other serious diseases. 2 Second: (/Here's What We Are Doing INSIDE The Office u 1. We expanded our hours to increase the availability of adjustment times. This significantly reduces the number of people inside the office at any given time. 2. We normally sanitize the adjusting tables several times a day, we are increasing this to after every patient visit. In addition, there are always antimicrobial wipes available in every adjusting room to use prior to your adjustments. 3. We have our office cleaned and sanitized every night, which includes all surfaces in the office. We also have the office professionally cleaned every weekend. Third: ,ruse Your SKED App! 0 ~ You can see how busy the office is during all shifts, every 15 minutes.

This will help prevent transmitting germs to surfaces you touch. 4. Practice social distancing, avoiding large groups (10 or more) and being extra aware of personal space right now. 5. If you are experiencing symptoms; fever, cough and difficulty breathing, call your primary care physician and follow their recommendations. If you have to go to the hospital, wear a mask to help prevent further spread of the virus. 6. If you are at greater risk from the virus, please talk to your doctors in advance to map out a plan on what you should do to prepare for quarantine or additional measures.

It is estimated by epidemiologists that a large majority of those in the US could become exposed to the coronaovirus. However, it is important to understand that it will not affect all individuals the same. For the majority of individuals, contracting the virus is expected to be similar to coming down with a cold or flu virus, followed by recovery. Symptoms for many will be mild to moderate. However, for individuals of advanced age, with complicating conditions or challenged immunities, it could cause more severe sickness or possible death. Measures taken by state and local officials have been based on emerging information as well as trends experienced in other areas that have already been exposed. In Ohio, the corona virus is expected to peak in exposure and confirmed cases sometime in April. Cancellation of school and other events, and restrictions on gathering sizes, have all been done in an attemR.t to reduce the number of f}_eOR.le that will become sick and to reduce the strain on the healthcare system so that resources are available to those who need it. ., THE FUTURE OF P1 c,,oooomoc I ...

Chiropractic contributes its unique salutogenic health care approach to the emergent COVID-19 crisis Politics, Position Papers , Science Chiropractic contributes its unique salutogenic health care approach to the emergent COVID-19 crisis Amy Haas and Dave Russell In the face of the current global concerns, it is important to work together as a community to support all possibilities for the optimal health and wellbeing of humanity. Chiropractic care is a unique salutogenic approach to health care that has been shown to improve overall well -being and to enhance physiological function and adaptability. Chiropractic therefore offers a valuable and important contribution in supporting the well-being of our international community at this trying time. The primary objective of chiropractic care is to optimize health and well-being through the enhancement of nervous system function by reducing nerve interference caused by vertebral subluxations. 1-4 Chiropractic care has been shown to enhance and/or restore nervous system functional integrity including sensorimotor integration, cortical processing, and physiological adaptability.5-10 Chiropractic care is salutogenic in nature, intended to support the body's intrinsic processes rather than to \"treat\" any specific symptom or pathology. To be clear, chiropractic is not a treatment for any infectious disease. In light of that, it is of note that a small-but-promising body of evidence suggests that chiropractic care may influence and support immune system function . 11-17 Though this evidence is preliminary, these data are of interest to consider in light of the intricate connection between the immune system and the nervous system, a field of quickly emerging research.12,18-21 The nervous system plays a crucial role in alerting and guiding immune system cells to where an infection is located in an essential and coordinated response to danger.12,18 Steinman 18 states 'There are three types of interactions between the CNS and the immune system: in the first, the CNS acts reciprocally with the immune system; in the second, the CNS drives immunity; and in the third, the immune system regulates the CNS\". The synergy and coordination between the nervous system and the immune system, and of these two systems with the endocrine system and the microbiome22-29, suggest that the chiropractic adjustment may have broad-reaching effects on salutogenesis and adaptability via modulation of these coordinated subsystems. Although the exact nature of the effect(s) of chiropractic care may have on immune system function specifically has certainly not yet been fully described, the beneficial and sustained effects that chiropractic care have on the function of the autonomic nervous system (responsible for organ and gland function) is established and the utility of chiropractic care for promotion of healthy adaptability, resilience, and salutogenesis is clear. Chiropractic care can therefore provide a valuable salutogenic resource for people whose we/I-being is tested by these stressful times 3o-37 While chiropractic care plays an important role in supporting numerous aspects of general wellbeing,5-11,38- 40 it does not, in any way, replace good hygiene and other healthy lifestyle practices or medical intervention for pathology or disease including COVID -19. Additionally, because chiropractors are portal of entry professionals, in the face of the current global pandemic all chiropractors should become very familiar with their local government and WHO guidelines for appropriate hygiene and facilities sanitation procedures as well as the management/referral of people infected with, or potentially infected with COVID-19. These public health regulations are of the highest priority and should be followed for the safety and protection of the rest of the community seen in one's practice. Q.

With covid-19 literally taking over all sources of tv, radio, and internet, we are choosing to take this time to emphasize the importance of maintaining health and minimizing the fear surrounding this pandemic.

Exercise- 20 minutes of low to moderate exercise per day is a perfect goal to have in order to keep your immune system in tip top shape.

Through the years a few new strains have been identified, such as, SARS in 2003, MERS in 2012, and now Novel/Wuhan Coronavirus in 2019. The 2019 Coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China and has spread across the world over the last few months. Wuhan is home to China's only Biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratory. A BSL-4 laboratory is a facility that operates under the highest level of biosafety precautions and is able to work with agents that could easily be aerosol-transmitted, cause fatal disease, and for which a treatment is unknown. In 2017 the Wuhan facility was authorized to begin working with potentially harmful agents, and the first priority was to study the SARS virus. This raised much worry around the globe because the SARS virus had already escaped a BSL -3 facility in Beijing on multiple occasions.1 FREE WELLNESS EXAMINATtON CLICK HERE!

CONTACT us V In 2015 it was published in the Methods of Molecular Biology that research was being conducted that involved bioengineering the full length cDNA of MERS as bac terial artificial chromosomes. The article claims tha t, \"the development of CoV infectious clones provides a valuable molecular tool to study fundamental viral processes, to develop genetically defined vaccines, and to test antiviral drugs .\" 2 Samples have provided evidence that COVID-19 is a clone of SARS as bacterial artificial chromosome . Based upon what has been described and the known fact that China hid the rate of COVID-19 infections in Wuhan from the World Health Organization (WHO) it is a reasonable assumption that this virus is a man-made bio-agent that escaped the BSL-4 facility in Wuhan. The virus has since spread across the world and has now been deemed a pandemic by the WHO, and when a disease is marked as a pandemic then the creation of a vaccine is allowed to be administered without prior human testing. The symptoms of the coronavirus include: runny nose, sore throat, cough, fever, and difficulty breathing in severe cases. This pandemic has caused panic in the United States due to its spread. Now is the time to choose faith over fear. Be your own best health advocate, and live the 5 essentials for optimal health. The key to not only overcoming COVID-19, but any potential health crisis is to live the 5 essentials, and it is never too late to start. Essential 1: Mindset Fear and worry about the coronavirus has caused people to empty shelves at grocery s tores and place a heightened attention to the news media . Fear and worry do not serve the immune system well, and actually disrupt the response of natural killer cells that are vital in fending off viral invaders.3 Some of the best ways to fend off fear and worry is: diaphragmatic breathing, walking outside, meditation, gratitude journaling, and exercise. Essential 2: Chiropractic The central nervous system is in charge of regulating immune function. The vertebral subluxation interferes with the transmission of nerve impulses traveling from and to the brain. This creates disorganization in the brain and that results in decreased immune response. In order to increase immune function it is vital to receive at least a weekly adjustment. It has been well documented in research that the adjustment immediately affects immune system function. People who receive adjustments weekly are shown to have 200% greater immune competence than the average population based on research by Ronald Pero, Ph.D., former chief of cancer prevention research at New York's Preventive Medicine Institute and professor of medicine at New York University. 0 About Us Chiropractic & More for your Health Education & Seminars Services 530-297-5683 (LOVE: Mothers & Children Visits Testimonials ContactU: STATEMENT OF COMMITMENT DURING COVID-19 CRISIS \"We would like to address the current coronavirus /Covid-19 public health crisis .

At the end of six months of care, the patients who had received regular adjustments had a 48% increase in the nu1nber of CD4+ T cells (p =0.06), whereas the patients who were not adjusted had an 8% decrease in CD4+ cells.

Get Adequate Sleep: Use this time to reevaluate your nighttime routines and sleep patterns. Lack of sleep has a massive impact on the responsiveness of your immune system. Aim for 7-8 hours per night for adults and 10-12 for children. Avoid technology and screens at least 60 minutes before sleep time. 2. Assess your Nutrition: It is imperative we feed our body nutrient-dense, high quality foods to support optimum overall functioning. Are you eating lots of vegetables and seasonal fruits? Are you purchasing local and/or organic foods? Organic quality is of particular importance for your protein and dairy choices. For a list of the best fruits and vegetables to buy organic, simply google \"Dirty Dozen and Clean Fifteen\". If you need guidance with your nutrition, please let us know! We are here to support you! 3. Hydrate with beverages that do not contain sugar and caffeine. 4. Exercise and move \"Nutritiously\" throughout your day. Aim for at least 20-30 min of exercise daily. Light exercise has been shown to augment the functionality of the immune system (so now is the time to get out and move your body on a daily basis)! 5. Get Adjusted: Chiropractic Care has been shown in several studies to have a positive effect on the immune system. Case studies show that including chiropractic care as a part of your health care routines help to support wellness year after year. Wellness COVID-19 Defense Against the Coronavirus and Influenza Understanding Infectious Disease and Immunity Each year, a new strain of virus circles the globe. Recently the COVID-19 virus (a.k.a. coronavirus), has captivated the news and caused much anxiety in the general population. Understanding the spread of infectious disease and how best to defend yourself can lessen the fear as well as your chances of being impacted by these infectious pathogens. Two Types of Defenses There are generally two types of defenses to viruses and pathogens. One is external and the other is internal. An external defense is something you can do to lessen your chances of being infected, or if infected, decrease the severity of the event. An internal defense is working with your body's own immune system to heighten your natural immunity and decrease the chances of catching the disease or the impact from it should you catch it. External Defenses External defenses include measures having to do with reducing the risk of exposure. These include general cleanliness and disinfectants. Precautions such as avoiding sneezing on someone or being sneezed on by someone is obvious. Hand washing after using public facilities, as well as the correct usage of hand sanitizer can also help. It should be noted that overuse of hand sanitizer is detrimental and can actually weaken your defenses. Masks and protective clothing are recommended for use by health professionals who are most at risk to exposure to infectious pathogens as well as for those who are already infected. Authorities in the U.S. are not recommending masks for general usage in lesser risk situations. Wellness ~::. ~ rlinic staff takes every precaution and is extremely diligent to ensure that our facility and equipment are sanitized to eliminate the threat of infectious disease spread. The discussion on the effectiveness of vaccinations, when even available, is a debate that is best left to healthcare professionals . This decision is best left between you and your doctor . Internal Defenses Internal defenses are those that your body innately has . These defenses are the best line of defense against any sort of pathogen. Functioning at 100% , your immune system is nearly impenetrable to pathogens that can make you sick. The key here is having your immune system functioning as close to 100% of its innate ability as possible. Do Not Lower Your Innate Immunity There are two ways to ensure that your defense systems are functioning properly. The first way is to not do things to yourself that can lower your internal immune system . Avoiding things such as smoking, and alcohol are big factors . Avoiding stress as best you can is also important. We should also minimize unnecessary medications and over-the -counter remedies that may weaken the body's ability to defend itself. A big area that we have control over is what we eat. Processed food, refined sugar, bleached flour, and foods with additives will have a negative impact on your immune system . There is a large volume of information available on what foods negatively impact your immune system. Lack of exercise or sleep can have a negative impact on your immune system. It has been shown that people who exercise properly and get the correct amount of sleep are less likely to get sick. Daily good habits in this area can help you against the threat of infectious diseases . Raising Your Innate Immunity Your immune system is controlled by your nervous system. Anything that interferes with proper nerve system function will have a negative impact on your immune system . Chiropractic has been shown to be the most effective form of healthcare for restoring proper nerve system function. The purpose of chiropractic care is to correct interference in your nerve system. The most common cause of interference to your nerve system is from vertebral subluxations. Subluxations can cause your nerve system to function at less than optimum and therefore have a negative effect on your immune system. Correcting subluxations through specific scientific chiropractic adjustments help to ensure that your nerve system and, therefore , your immune system are functioning as close to their maximum innate potential as possible. This increases your defenses against outside pathogens and increases your potential to stay healthy. Several research studies published in peer-reviewed journals suggest that the chiropractic adjustment may support immune function . tf::. A .. -~~ihilih, ViA \\.

Typically, patients on a maintenance schedule will be able to hold their chiropractic adjustments from 1-3 weeks, depending on stress levels. However, in times of immune system suppression, a patient can have their spine examined for misalignments several times per week to ensure their nervous system is free of interference. White blood cells, which eat and destroy bad cells, are enhanced through chiropractic care.1 ,Ir ,Ir Science has shown that getting adjusted boosts the immune system!~~ i ~ f The chief of cancer prevention at New York's Preventative Medicine Institute found that people who received regular chiropractic care over a five-year period had a 200% greater immune competence than those who had not received chiropractic care.

We've got you covered. Other common-sense measures to protect yourself and prevent spread of illness include: Chiropractic adjustments have been proven to improve your immune system. Research has shown that chiropractic care helps clear the signals from your brain to your body, including your immune system. Regular adjustments are not just for aches and pains, they also enhance the way all the systems in your body communicate and thereby function better. Take off your clothes . After being in a public space, take off your shoes and outer clothes. Leave them outside and/or in the direct sun since COVID-19 doesn't like heat or sunlight. Load up on foods and spices with antiviral properties. Consider coconut oil, raw garlic, oregano, ginger, fermented foods, walnut, pomegranate, green tea, and apple cider vinegar. Eat lots of colorful fruits and vegetables. They are full of antioxidants which will destroy the free radicals that weaken our immune system and are responsible for making us feel sick when we catch a bug. Each color provides different antioxidant power - so be sure to eat a rainbow every day. If you're kids aren't the hugest vegetable eaters yet, give them their antioxidant dose with a smoothie packed with fruits AND veggies, use that smoothie to make jello with grass-fed gelatin or popsicles, sneak pureed vegetables into your spaghetti sauce, soups, chilis, or whatever other way you can think of - be creative! After testing millions of people it is clear the majority are antioxidant deficient. Unless there is a dramatic change in dietary habits, lifestyle, environment, etc most will remain deficient of the best defense mechanism of your immune system and therefore will benefit from the most potent antioxidants available, LifePak. This has a combination of multi - antioxidants/vitamins/minerals your body needs. Citrus fruits are an excellent source of vitamin C and are high in antioxidants. Vitamin C helps with stabilization of mast cells and basophils. Often when we experience an allergic response, cold/flu, there is a histamine response. This increases permeability in the body which contributes to a running nose, watery eyes, and low-grade fever. Excellent sources of immune boosting citrus fruits are grapefruit, oranges, tangerines, limes/lemons and clementines. Red bell peppers contain twice as much vitamin C than ordinary citrus fruits. They are also rich in beta carotene. Beta carotene is converted to vitamin A in the body which will aid in healthy skin and mucous membranes, as well as improve eye health and vision. Those that are smokers or have a history of smoking should obtain beta carotene naturally and not in synthetic form as it may increase the risk for lung cancer. Broccoli is rich in fiber, antioxidants and is packed with vitamins A, C and E. Helping the sick get well and the healthy excel!

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, the first to be caused by coronavirus. As the status of the outbreak is rapidly evolving, we want to let our patients know what steps we are taking to address the situation in the office now, as well as what we recommend for our patients outside of the office. This information is based on the most current updates from the World Health Organization, the State of Michigan, the Michigan Association of Chiropractors, and other official sources. The office always follows standard protocols for cleaning surfaces, especially patient contact surfaces. At this time, we are cleaning adjusting tables after each patient, and for other hard surfaces in patient areas we are cleaning frequently, as well as nightly. In addition we are diligently cleaning all other surfaces, bathroom, door handles, etc. To review other recommendations on personal steps you can take at home, as recommended by the CDC, please visit their website for details. At this point we will be open for normal practice hours. We will update if this changes, using our automated text reminders, emails, and social media platforms. What YOU can do to work towards staying healthy: 1. Get Adjusted -You should be focusing on boosting your immune system. Chiropractic adjustments have been shown to affect the Immune System, and its ability to fight infection . Now more than ever, you should be getting ADJUSTED! In times of immune system suppression, a patient should have their nervous system examined for subluxation several times per week to ensure they are free of interference. Very important immune components, called white blood cells, eat and destroy bad cells, and are enhanced through chiropractic care! If you are not sure if you should be adjusted, or should enter the practice, call and we will discuss with you. We may be able to make special arrangements to see you outside of normal practice hours. 2. Do your best not to live in fear or anxiety about the situation. Yes, it is a serious matter that requires our attention. However, it is important to note that when we get trapped in a fear response our immune systems shut down in favor of survival mechanisms, which actually further heighten our anxiety! Be wise and discerning about your lifestyle practices and choices, and trust you are doing what you can to keep yourself and your family safe. 3. Fresh air is vital to healthy immunity - make a point of getting outside, daily. Even as little as 10 to 15 minutes three times throughout the day will benefit you. 4. Rest! Get plenty of sleep and rest. 5. Increase your consumption of anti-oxidant and nutrient-dense infectionfighting foods like: organic blueberries, raspberries, spinach, sprouts, garlic, onions, ginger, parsley, cilantro, spirulina, celery juice, bone broth and fermented foods and beverages. 6. Drink lots of water. Drinking good quality water and herbal teas, staying hydrated, is one of the best things you can do to flush out toxins from your body and help support the immune system. Remember that eating unrefined salt (i.e. Sea Salt) is critical, to help balance your water intake . You can conservatively consume \u00bd to 1 full teaspoon of salt per day. 7. Keep your immune system strong by reducing your sugar intake and eating a balanced diet. Avoid eating processed sugars. Sugar weakens the immune system and makes it less able to deal with viruses and bacteria. Be sure to read food labels carefully and to limit the amount of sugar you eat 8. Supplement your healthy food choices, with essential nutrients . Most important at this time would include Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Vitamin A, and Iodine. Note that the amounts are different for all people, and you should ask Dr. Dan if you have specific questions! Stay well!

It contained the following interesting paragraph on the flu: a) \"Chiropractic care was first linked to improved immunity during the deadly flu epidemic of 1917 and 1918. The funny thing was: Chiropractic patients fared better than the general population. This observation spurred a study of the field. The data reported that victims under chiropractic care had an estimated .25 percent death rate. A lot less than the normal rate of 5 percent among victims who did not receive chiropractic care:' This equates to Chiropractic patients having a 20 fold {20 times better) result.

Get adjusted! Chiropractic adjustments improve immune system response. One study, from the National College of Chiropractic in Lombard, Illinois, found that disease-fighting white blood cell counts were higher just 15 minutes after a chiroQractic adjustment was applied to the upper back. Making sure the connection between your brain and your immune system is at its best is one of the first steps to a healthier immune system, no cell will function the way it should if it is not getting the right messages. Schedule an appointment at Stow Family Chiropractic to get your next adjustment! 2. Wash your hands often and thoroughly for at least 20 seconds. This is one of the most important strategies you can incorporate into your virus prevention plan. Despite popular belief, the temperature of the water used for washing is unimportant. The important action includes vigorously rubbing with soap and water for 20 seconds before rinsing your hands completely. Regular hand washing has been shown to reduce your risk of contracting a cold or flu by up to 21%. 3. Don't touch your face. Many infections are introduced by touching infected areas, like handrails, and then touching your mouth or nose. These are the areas where a virus is likely to infect your body. So always wash your hands before touching your face. Researchers have found that the average person in a public place touches their face 3.6 times per hour. That is a staggering 60 times per day for most individuals, which greatly increases self-inoculation with viruses. 4. Eat the rainbow of fruit, vegetables and berries. These foods provide a wide pharmacy of phytonutrients, which are natural plant chemicals that work directly to support your immune system to more effectively fight off viruses.

By correcting the spinal hypo-mobilities and restoring proper function to your nervous system with regular chiropractic adjustments , the neural dysfunction will decrease and your immune system will be able to work properly.

We are primary care providers and chiropractic care represents an essential and necessary component of the health care program of millions of patients of all ages and all walks of life in the United States and worldwide. The news of coronavirus (COVID-19) and its ongoing impact on everything from federal interest rates to your ability to attend church services is now capturing the attention of our country. While you might be wondering how coronavirus is impacting your work, home, school and community gatherings, I want to take a moment and assure you that our clinic is open and committed to serving you during this moment of uncertainty.

Keeping the Office Safe for You Our commitment to you also extends to your time in the office for your chiropractic adjustments and nutritional care: We are practicing social distancing. Waiting room chairs are six feet apart. All appointments are staggered and spinalators are shut down. We are diffusing Thieves oils which carry natural anti-viral properties into our air We are using hand sanitizers between each adjustment We are sanitizing all areas of high touch points multiple times throughout the day We will be providing an extra immune boosting supplement with your adjustments Focus on Your Health At the moment we urge you to resist the temptation to forgo your chiropractic and nutritional care -if anything it's time to increase your focus on your spine, nerve system, and immunity. Your Gut and the Coronavirus: Your immune system and gut are intimately connected. It's estimated that as much as 80% of your immune system resides within your gut. An out-of-balance gut/microbiome can weaken your immune system. To enhance your gut/immune health eat plenty of fermented and cultured foods, focus on your prebiotic and probiotics which can also enhance your immune system strength. Your Diet and the Coronavirus: A strong immune system begins with what you find at the end of your fork. Load up on antioxidant-rich vegetables and focus on low glycemic fruits (berries), for instance, which can decrease free radicals, which ultimately keeps your immune system strong. The omega-3 fatty acids in wild-caught fish/grass-fed meats can help manage inflammation levels. The healing diet we have introduced to you provides all the nutrients you need to keep your immune system healthy. Get Adjusted: Now more than ever keep your adjusting and nutrition schedule, or request an extra adjustment weekly! Research shows those who receive regular (weekly) chiropractic care had 200% stronger immune system than those who did not get adjusted. Double your Vitamin D3: Adults: 10,000 IU daily Children: 3-5000 IU daily D3 activates your P53 gene which is responsible for DNA synthesis of your immune system. It also has been shown very effective for upper respiratory issues and so much more. Double/Triple your Vitamin C: Adults: 2-3,000mg daily at minimum If dealing with issues can do 1-2,000mg/per hour awake Children: 500-1,000mg daily Vitamin C stimulates the production of white blood cells, especially lymphocytes which are anti-viral. Use Essential Oil Hand Sanitizer. Most store-bought hand sanitizers contain toxic ingredients. We have plenty for you. More Tips for Staying Healthy Sleep well: Your immune system regenerates itself with 7-8 hrs of restful sleep (sleep is especially important between the hours of 11 pm -2am). Mindset and thoughts: What you think and fill your head with plays a huge roll in how healthy you can and will be and how powerful and effective your immune system is. Look for all the opportunities of happiness and hope especially even more now. Do NOT subject yourself to anyone spouting doom and gloom. Negative thoughts, fear and stress down-regulate the immune system. Stay hydrated and keep sugar intake to a minimum: Drink half your body weight in ounce~ water daily). Your body is made up of mostly water and it's needed to flush things. Sugar is a foe faster.

Connect fa Subscribe to our Newsletter First Name L Email address : l ._ Brooke Niemela \u00b7 March 20, 2020 A novel form of Coronavirus, known as COVI D-19, has spread rapidly across the globe, as well as across the media. It is hard now to turn to any news source without hearing about the pandemic and its worldwide effects, as wel I as recommendations from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) on ways to prevent further spreading in your community. Some of these measures are good health advice in general, such as washing your hands and minimizing how much you touch your face. The most talked about recommendation is \"social distancing/ which is basically not leaving your house or interacting with people unless it 's absolutely necessary for your health or safety. It is recommended, however, that you keep up with all essential health care appointments, which includes visits to a Bentonville chiropractor. Arbor Vitae Chiropractic recognizes that chiropractic care has immune boosting benefits and will continue providing care to practice members during this critical time. The Neuroimmune Connection Chiropractic care focuses on the central nervous system, which controls messages sent from your brain to other parts of your body. In addition to this vital task, the central nervous system also controls your body 's immune system. The immune system is devoted to holding off any foreign illnesses, and when working properly, it allows your body to stay healthy in the face of disease, including when viruses are running rampant. In a situation such as we're seeing with COVID-19, the health of your immune system will play a large role in your susceptibility to sickness, as well as the ability to heal quickly and fu I ly if you do contract the virus. Our bodies have something called the vagus nerve, which extends up past the top of the neck, which highlights the connection between these the central nervous system and immune system. The interaction between these is known as the inflammatory reflex arc. This indicates that anything being misaligned or otherwise off in the neck and spine can lead to diminished capabilities of the immune system. A gentle adjustment from Dr. Tom Niemela can align the spine, boosting your immune system . Research has shown that not only does chiropractic care encourage higher immunity, preventing sickness in the first place, but it can also help the body recover more quickly when illnesses do take hold. In one study , a young boy showing symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and headache underwent regular chiropractic adjustments. Within an hour of an adjustment, his fever began to lower, and some of the musculoskeletal symptoms he was experiencing subsided. Where medicinal options did not improve this boy's health, chiropractic adjustments provided both short-term and lpng-term relief. Commitment to Care During COVID-19 One of the reasons COVID-19 has caused chaos so quickly is that there is no existing cure, either through traditional medicine or alternative practices. Depending on severity and an individual's health, symptoms can be addressed, but the main goal as of now is to prevent spread of the disease. Where spreading has already happened, the focus is on keeping vulnerable individuals safe. Much of the outcome will be dependent on our immune systems doing their job, preventing us from getting sick, and if we do get sick, helping us to recover. Immunity is more important than ever at this time, and chiropractic care can help improve immunity, so now is not the time to miss appointments for adjustments. The staff at Arbor Vitae Chiropractic and Dr. Tom Niemela are committed to serving our practice members during this time. While the news can be overwhelming, you can take action by taking control of your own health, which includes visiting us in Bentonv ille for adjustments.

Of them, 3,946 cases were listed as MILD. That means 12 people are considered in serious condition. 99. 7 percent of active cases fall into the mild category. The number of people presenting with mild condit ions is increasing. Last week, 89 percent of U.S. cases were listed as mild. People in the mild category should expect their symptoms to pass in one to three days. Consider these additional data points : -On March 3, 17 days after the first diagnoses in the United States, the mortality rate was 7.25 percent. Today, the mortality rate is 1. 73 percent. That is a 76 percent drop in the ratio of confirmed cases to deaths. - For people over 80 years old, five out of six - 83 percent - will present with only mild symptoms. Older adults and people who have severe underlying chronic medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends social distancing to slow the spread of the disease and \"flatten the curve.\" The primary outcome of flattening the curve is not to reduce the number of cases, but to reduce the speed at which the virus spreads - the purpose of which is to prevent overwhelming health care facilities that may be incapable of managing a massive influx of patients. Going to the emergency room or a doctor's office without advance notice of your arrival is not recommended right now. Testing kits are available only in limited quantities and they need to be used on people who present with serious conditions. As you may have heard by now, the CDC recommends that organizers of events with more than 50 people cancel or postpone for the next eight weeks. We respect the recommendations of government health officials and recognize that many people, especially those with pre-existing conditions, are concerned about the virus. We believe that you should take whatever precautions you feel are necessary to protect yourself. With the above data points in mind, we want to remind you that prevention is the best medicine! The most commonly overlooked form of prevention is boosting your own immune response .

PUBLISHED ON MARCH 13, 2020 I The Corona Virus Catastrophe: Countries are closing down, travel is banned, the stock markets have come tumbling to all time lows .. Sounds like the story of Chicken Little - \"the sky is falling, the sky is falling!\" When you read about this new curse please focus your read ing on the science and not the Media driven panic. The \"sky is not falling\", we simply are scared because there is no known vaccine to combat this particular virus. The Science tells us: The people at risk of contracting the virus and even dying from it are people whose immune systems are all ready depressed and who are all ready vulnerable. Their bodies can not respond to the virus by creating new anti bodies. The sick, elderly, and immune depressed. Essentially these folks are all ready sick and vulnerable to all virus' and in fact the common flu virus kills far more than the Corona virus. Unfortunately this is Nature's way, the health survive and the very ill don't. In The Absence of a Vaccine -The Answer then is to Boost Your Own Immune System? Science tells us if you have a normal immune system and contract the virus you may get some flu like symptoms while your body builds up your immunity to the virus, and then you are immune to its effects into the future. Can I Build my own Immunity? Yes, you can. Nature's laws dictate that we should eat, sleep, exercise, and live life styles that promote our well being. Nature's laws dictate that we should pay attention to common sense hygiene. Wash hands frequently, keep everything clean and orderly. Eat unprocessed real foods, exercise to reduce cardio risk factors, keep your spine free and functioning by attending proactively to your Chiropractic adjustments. There are many proactive things we can do. To encapsulate them into 2 words - Pay attention to our \"Health and Hygiene\". This is not the End of the World: Please be led by the science and not the Media hype . Listen to and read the science. We will get over this as we did other catastrophes over the centuries, and we will survive as a civilisation. Remember the great \"American Swine Flu Fiasco\", only the aged and in-firmed were impacted, however as soon as the vaccination became available toward the end of the epidemic, millions were vaccinated. The same thing will occur here, in the mean time build your own immune systems Naturally. NI Foll D -- COVID-19 x March 11, 2020 Boosting Your Immune System and Avoiding Corona Virus! Nutrition, Health and Wellness, Chiropractic As coronavirus (COVID-19) is at the top of the headlines, stay informed from trusted information sources such as the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Below are reasonable steps you can take to help keep yourself healthy and safe. Boost your immune system! First and foremost, I urge all of you to do everything possible to stay healthy yourself. It's essential to prioritize your well-being and do all you can to boost your immune system. Research shows that sustaining healthy habits supports immunity and can help prepare our bodies to better fight and recover from illnesses. Stick to a nutrient-dense, toxin-free diet, including known immune-supportive foods like garlic and ginger. Avoid foods that tend to weaken the immune system, such as sugar, refined grains, and all processed and refined foods, as much as you can. Keep alcohol consumption to a minimum. Continue receiving adjustments, they increases the activity of the body's white blood cells that work to combat viruses. Practice mindfulness. Research suggests that mindful meditation can have benefits for health including immune function. Get adequate sleep, ideally seven to eight hours a night. This is your body's time to perform preventive maintenance, which bolsters the immune system. Research shows that repeatedly short-changing sleep by even an hour or two can negatively affect immunity. Get plenty of sunshine and supplemental Vitamin D and K2. High levels of vitamin D have long been linked to lower rates of illness. Consider taking additional vitamins, micronutrients, and supplements to support immunity, such as a high-quality multivitamin, magnesium, omega-3, vitamin C, elderberry, and digestive enzymes. Probiotics and powdered greens have also been shown to support immune and gut health. Get at least 20 minutes of low- to moderate-intensity exercise a day to prime the immune system. This movement results in the production of more white blood cells, which combat bacteria and viruses, and promotes improved circulation. "}
