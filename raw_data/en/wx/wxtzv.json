Houngbo of the International Labor Organization, and then jointly met the press. Li Keqiang said that the roundtable has produced much new consensus, and conveyed confidence in upholding multilateralism, strengthening multilateral cooperation and promoting global economic development. Participants shared the view that the world economy is facing multiple severe challenges rarely seen in many years, and greater difficulties call for enhanced common actions. Major economies and major international economic organizations need to step up coordination on macro policies, properly balance steady growth and inflation prevention, maintain international financial stability, ensure steady operation of energy and food markets, and keep global industrial and supply chains stable and smooth. China is a beneficiary and promoter of global opening up, and a defender of and contributor to the existing international order and economic and trade rules. China firmly supports the six major international economic organizations in further leveraging their roles as platforms to promote greater two-way opening up. Li Keqiang briefed on China's economic situation. He pointed out that facing the impact of the pandemic and other factors beyond expectation this year, China promptly introduced a package of policies and measures to stabilize the economy. As a result, the downward trend at the beginning of the second quarter was quickly reversed, and the economy is recovering and showing stabilizing momentum. On the whole, China has achieved stability in employment and prices, and kept its overall economic performance stable. Major economic indicators are within an appropriate range. As the measures for further improving the COVID-19 response are put into practice in a gradual and orderly way, China's economic growth will continue to rebound. Li Keqiang said that China's opening up has not only boosted its own development but also benefited the world. Reform and opening up is a sure path toward a better life for the people. It's a door to opportunities and to the future. Opening up will broaden our horizon and lead to boundless prospects. China will keep advancing high-level opening up and steadily expand institutional opening up. We welcome more foreign investors to invest and do business in China. Heads of the international economic organizations attending the dialogue spoke positively of the \"1+6\" Roundtable as an important platform for candid and in-depth exchanges among various parties. They noted that under the current circumstances, it is imperative for various parties to step up communication and policy coordination, uphold multilateralism and free trade, work together to address global challenges such as climate change and debt issues, enhance the resilience of the global financial system, and inject impetus into the recovery and growth of the global economy as well as global sustainable development. The world needs China for its development, and China is an important engine of global economic growth. They are optimistic about China's economic prospects, and are glad to see China expanding its opening up. They welcomed China's recalibration of its COVID-19 response, which they believed will give a boost to the recovery of China's economy and the world economy. They appreciated China's support for major international economic organizations, and expressed readiness to deepen partnerships and cooperation with China, promote two-way opening up and common development, and contribute to the well-being of all peoples. On the afternoon of the same day, Li Keqiang and the heads of the six major international economic organizations posed for a group photo in front of the Guest-Greeting Pine on Huangshan Mountain. He said that an open China welcomes visitors from all over the world. Xiao Jie and others were present at the events. "}
