Surgical Alternatives & Holistic Medicine Treatment Options Home Exercise Program Part of getting healthy and staying healthy is increasing your activity at home.

With our holistic medicine approach, we get to the root cause of your ailments and guide you to increase your activities and exercise safely and comfortably at home. Chiropractic Care Seeing a chiropractor before you resort to surgery may be one of the best decisions you make. After all, chiropractic care may be able to provide you with relief from anything from neck and back pain to foot, knee pain, or shoulder pain. Chiropractic care focuses on improving mobility in your spine, or other joints such as knees and shoulders, to improve circulation and healing, reduce pressure on cartilage, spinal discs, or nerves, boost the body's natural immune response, and reduce pain and swelling. Following the holistic medicine recommendations of a chiropractor now may mean preventing surgery. For more information, visit our [chiropractic information page](https://alignedmedicalgroup.com/chiropractic-care/). Trigger Point Injections Another holistic medicine alternative to surgery is trigger point injections. Trigger points are focused, ball-like knots in muscle tissue. Poor posture, stress, injuries, muscle or joint overuse, and improper lifting habits may create muscle tension and stress, leading to trigger points. When trigger points form, they can become painful, even referring pain away from the trigger point location, or create headache-like, or sciatica-like pain. Trigger point injections contain a solution called Sarapin to numb the pain, calm nerves and muscle tightness, and reduce inflammation. Sarapin is homeopathic, without side effects, and calms muscle and nerve tissue. This type of injection is administered directly into the trigger point. This is particularly helpful for patients dealing with painful and frequent muscle aches, headaches, tension, or postural fatigue. Functional Medicine and Nutrition Your body is amazingly complex. We have delicate balances of vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, and bacteria throughout our body, including the bowels and gut. Balance can easily be disrupted from exposure to alcohol, smoking, sugar intake, heavy metal accumulation, food sensitivities or allergies, and medications. Whether you are seeking to improve your general health and wellness, or treat a specific medical condition, we recommend a detailed evaluation of how your body is balanced. When the bacteria in your gut become imbalanced, many ailments can ensue, including, but not limited to; autoimmune diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatic conditions, fatigue, bloating, and weight gain. Mineral and hormone balance is important for concentration, healthy body weight, and energy levels. At Aligned Medical, we do on-site and off-site testing, looking at things like blood, urine, hair, and stool analysis. From this data, we can make holistic medicine lifestyle recommendations, dietary and supplement changes, and sometimes medications so you begin feeling good again.

Cell-Based Therapeutics Using cell-based therapeutics, we can stimulate the body's natural healing process. Whether you are dealing with a serious injury or a chronic disease, our holistic medicine team may be able to help you lead a healthier, happier life thanks to regenerative cell and tissue treatments. Products are extracted from either your own blood or from donated tissues. Umbilical cords have millions of stem cells, billions of exosomes, and a cocktail of things called cytokines and growth factors. It's a blend of natural healing. Donated tissues from umbilical cords are FDA regulated and very safe to use. The donating mother and baby are healthy and unharmed from the collection of the cord, which happens immediately after birth. If you suffering from cartilage loss, joint tears, rotator cuff tears, meniscus, or labral tears, call us to learn how these powerful healing remedies may help you.
