Is there anything you can do to boost your immunity and lower your chances of getting it? Let's learn all about the virus that has caused an uncontrollable pandemic worldwide and how we can protect ourselves from contracting Covid-19. Symptoms of Covid-19 When coronavirus affects a person, it comes out in the form of cold, dry cough, fever, sore throat, weakness, and fatigue among other variable symptoms. Since the body's natural defences drop with coronavirus, prevention is definitely the best cure. How Covid-19 spreads If an infected person's saliva touches a surface, then that surface becomes a host for the virus. Any person who touches the same surface - a doorknob, napkin, elevator button, it could be anything, has been exposed and can contract this virus. Recent studies and cases have now confirmed that the virus is airborne too. So, it has become quite difficult to protect ourselves in the open outdoors. Which is why it has been advised that people stay indoors in this second wave of pandemic to prevent contracting it. How to prevent Corona? - Avoid going to places where there is a crowd. If you do go out, wear a mask - some health workers advise two masks even! - Maintain personal hygiene, wash your hands, face, and any other exposed area or take a bath (if you go out). Use hand sanitizers before and after touching things in a public place. Even at home, wash your hands several times in a day. It is one of the best ways to ensure that you don't contract the virus. - Stay hydrated. Lack of water in our body causes the cells to become dry, and it becomes a breeding ground for the virus. - Similarly, keep putting oil or ghee in your nostrils (one to two drops every few hours) as dry nostrils are prone to infection. - Rest well, consume fresh food and freshly cooked food, to ensure that your immunity levels don't go down. Building immunity is the way forward Ayurvedic herbs around us have immunity-boosting potency. Nature is the remedy to this man-made virus.
